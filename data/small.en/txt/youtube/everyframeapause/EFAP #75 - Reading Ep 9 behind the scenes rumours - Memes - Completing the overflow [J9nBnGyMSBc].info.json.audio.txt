here we go assuming it was so about minorities no I heard that you love
minorities he does I do therefore they're my people yeah he's pure I just
love how people start commenting on my fucking they're my people hey chase I
heard you hate minorities and all my fucking normie audience is just like it's
actually I literally had someone because someone asked me like a story
this asked me on a YouTube story like how you feel about minorities and I just
kind of like played along I was like yeah kind of pick and choose some
somewhere cool not everyone's gonna be in that way wait yeah I had someone
literally comment be like I had someone comment be like okay fucking Nazi the
truth can hit man I don't know hey Germans are a minority that's true not
humans are a minority and the vastness of space probably maybe I mean a lot of a
lot of all kinds of tisms out there so really chase was just saying he hates
everyone he's just a missing throat yeah I wouldn't really disagree with that you
know hello chat how do you do we maybe have been a little late today we had
plans for guests they fell through but not that that's ever happened before but
this time we came with a backup plan we always come with a backup plan it's
fine it's just I love how Coke man just said oh no not Chase I'm sorry you are
kind of annoying you know like incredible I actually am like that's that's I fully
agree with that I get in your case a lot mm-hmm yeah I suppose everything's
everything's working just fine now so I don't even have to do anything I'm so
happy I guess it's we're probably gonna open up with some memes I'm gonna look
at this reddit post about things that went on with Star Wars episode 9 that
most don't know about that are quite interesting very very curious well and
all means then we're gonna look at just a handful of meme videos that are all
copyright friendly then all memes then probably super chats actually give me
nice and chill today we've not got a huge controversial subject to cover
about how a piece of media is amazing or terrible when the reverse is what we
expect uh what about the homecoming discussion
well remember that only on discord on on discord yeah I mean we've had what
like three episodes about that shit you know I don't know how to explain why
vulture would have a gun yeah I mean it's pretty absurd that a criminal would
have a gun I mean that's unheard of unbelievable I I don't think I could any
film where a criminal has a gun instantly bad yeah like you watching the
godfather it's like god jeez what's going on look at there's already anime
questions in chat you disgust me really yeah that's definitely like an anime
laughter I've got these these are these are set up there's an order to these
otherwise I would fuck them all up and this is unironically the first one of
memes
it's a fucking another anime meme damn yeah okay here's the funny thing right
you would actually probably be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of Jojo
Mueller oh would I now it's very it's very cleverly written are you cleverly
written no but I trust that you know what is cleverly written because
everyone else agrees with me Oh a lot of them add the night them to
site them yeah that's Latin but that's a bad argument okay well so you think you
can fix it try if you must Jojo oh really you ruined my movie with themes
and feelings cuz feelings are gay Ryan damn you ha ha you're so naive Jojo you
can't ruin something I already ruined ah so you are going to make the next movie
worse hmm you come closer it's pretty half-baked I think what's best is just
like the really shitty they just posted the picture of JJ on the bodies he's
got this suit and everything it's not even just like is rose like is rose
like Ryan Johnson stand there I can't even tell why she's there yeah oh I get
it the last and first efaps of 2019 and 20 pretty much the same efaps so very
clever very I have a Tico Star Wars story and even uh Quentin reviews the
sex doll got in there from the visionary director of all just fan stuff it's only
a sequel if you fucking hate Trump in my subjective opinion best performance
by any walk since boys in the hood every time I see Rose I feel like you could
just swap air out with Danny DeVito is from chase face apparently do I you
know what yeah I did say that that just came back to me racist pissing off white
supremacist is the most easy and fun thing to do in the world when the reviews
finally Star Wars that isn't just a ripoff of Harry Potter so big idiots
enjoyed this movie apparently not leading actress heart basically just a
gay a vision of Robocop damn Tico is proof that two bombs went enough oh that
was from literally Hitler apparently he's reviewing films like I don't know
man Quentin and Jeff Nichols present a massive production in association with
diabetes studios Tico double story I mean I would go would check that out why
not at this point right can't get any worse you know like there could be some
great characters in there you don't know um this is obviously a reference to one
of our streams but I don't even remember what the discussion was but I could
totally imagine that these perspectives are held by these two people I know the
meme like the the what is it the Team Fortress 2 SFM thing I like that weird
comma in the middle of all women comma Queens all women are Queens he's a good
boy uses punctuation yeah but that's like actually incorrect I was gonna say
I like to imagine that you're that fucking tiny in real life it's like
Tom and Jerry is 80 years old this year so that's a perfect timing and they're
old oldest yes I'm just actually the shit can I just say yeah Tom and Jerry's
awesome yeah he opens this video at Rises Cowker I think saying this is fine
like yeah it's like poetry rhymes oh hey we haven't seen the people over at the
French efab for a while when you realize you're representing a far-right women
hating podcast poor lady you believe the French stole our thing unbelievable
that's an order liquid de nouveau met one de la communication is it met one
thought it was mittier I'm just fucking making up as I go along I'm just rich
women too you've dated French women whoa one once I would not fucking recommend
I think we've compared them to thumbs separately oh my goodness oh the thumb
people from spy kids know what that is yeah one of my kids how many were there
were there like three honestly there was four thing we'll take a look at like a
fifth one in 3d or something so the fourth one was 3d I don't know spy kids
3d Stallone was the bad guy right it was a weird one spy kids loop isn't that
man help us save us can flu there are four there are four spy kids movies one
two and then there's the pretty one spy kids to the island of lost dreams spy
kids 3d game over and spy kids all the time in the world what do I recognize
that mean I mean I know the fucking look at his photograph but I don't want
to give context with this one I just love the way it is oh look another
relevant beam considering what we just saw
the guy's dimensions just right I like the proportions they're very effective
beautiful work
like you took everything for me I don't even know who he was so applicable oh my
goodness
honey Anakin could kill you I don't think I've ever seen Ray smile that much
before this was from when I was saying if Vader had come back with Luke and was
like healthy and fine and then they color him white and put a smile on his
face to try and make him seem friendly I was just like I don't think he looks
friendly he looks terrifying wife Vader he looks like um like if you're playing
a horror game and there's a dude just silently following you yeah whole thing
yeah he fat people who like good movies beat up writer Skywalker and then the
TLJ defenders jump right in even though afterwards it should end with both of
them getting beaten up I like that meme a lot 1992 Los Angeles riots you can't
say that on TV this is I guess referencing how Quentin would constantly
compare like Rides of Sky will get a Harry Potter for some reason
I think I need much context for this one pretty simple this time for realsies
though how can you tell that it is it actually is the last time though I don't
know I don't know how it works if he actually got on the cover of a magazine
I'd be okay with that oh yeah I hate cooked carrots you don't like that shit
came out of nowhere and it was fantastic I'm gonna see you guys reaction I was
like that's amazing it's completely disarming finally found it after 15
years the scroll of truth later on in 2049 isn't as good as you think oh yeah
that's like that's complete yeah oh so oh my god Tropic Thunder reference nice
oh boy TLJ fans that hated RRS we're supposed to be a unit yes I don't think I've seen that
shot of Quentin before he's got poopy on his face oh oh oh no Anna's cheek and yeah movie
Bob was like I feel like he's still like one of the only prominent if you call it
probably critics that gave it a high school episode 9 where the fun begins no he's gonna
say that it chased me oh yeah this is an ironically merchandise from movie Bob I was made aware of this
huh that's um it's an incredible Photoshop job the site does yeah God imagine first off
the green and black imagine it's not a great picture with movie Bob imagine wearing that
why would anyone with what kind of what kind of shirt design is that the big picture with movie
Bob who wants that hey mauler associate my real-life percentage and imagine like you bought a shirt
that said like 360 with Anderson Cooper it's just like a I want to I feel like you guys would
appreciate this I recently got uh I mean you guys know but the audience doesn't know I recently got
a job as an audio engineer and it's like you know kind of younger people that run it and um they
told me at one point oh yeah the only reason we'll ever fire anyone or not hire anyone is if they're
just a massively toxic piece of shit on the internet or like on Twitter and I was like oh
and uh so I had to ask them I was like yeah I mean I'm part of a fucking group of people
that we do like podcasts and we kind of clown on people with shitty hot take like uh youtube videos
and and uh like every now and then I'll kind of make fun of how movie Bob is like a disingenuous
piece of shit and he was just like yeah that's fine they they were immediately just like don't
worry about it that's a good movie Bob oh yeah we all hate movie Bob here basically
and the only person who found out to defend him is Patrick Willems is the only person who defends him so
good old Patrick he knows what's up right um yeah I don't know I just I would be curious to
find out if literally anyone has bought that um imagine buying that I'm wearing it proudly
the thing is that it's terrible even if you take off the words yep yeah green and black is not like
the best color combination you know this is this picture of this chick specifically this
chick wearing this this is like his ultimate fantasy probably I guess this is what when movie
Bob is like I got five minutes till I have to go I want to come I want to I'm going to jerk off
before I go I got to think of the best thing ever so I can get this out really quick this is it
I guess it got a five star rating from 11 people
no 4.6 sorry 11 people bought it I doubt that right they're probably like I'll give it a high
rating because I like Bob but I'm not buying that piece of shit you're gonna buy it no I'm back
it's unbelievable look at it looks awful it looks like um something that they would wear in
one of those dystopian novels where everyone wears the same shitty outfit AJ Abrams how fucking
dare you so intimate like you'd meant to send him a DM you really should have put that tweet out
no she made him a complete hypocrite
I got a meme has an eyebrow raised my blade is only for killing monsters
what about the guy who just killed he was the worst monster of all having a theme doesn't make
a movie automatically good the worst monster I like the little green milk thing on there like
that little yes it's probably the bubbly green milk this was actually from that um tivity war
video just as a screenshot it's a nice little logo maybe I'll do something with that at some
point yeah I like it like super referential to old marveltisms
so this is a very specific meme a man of madame meme um typing in your fucking name in that game
was impossible like I'll have to show you guys the the vod of me and metal planet
but the like the UI was so garbage that it kept sending it back to the main menu
all you have to do is type in your name and hit enter it's like oh no no no no that was the
hardest part of the game just imagine the music playing
get a leaf apps you gotta know who your real family is
yep so I guess this is gonna be episode 10 I'm looking forward to it uh name is pending
no improvement that's a word I feel like you would actually make a pretty compelling star
wars villain wow I think that's a compliment yeah it's pretty cool we got fans all over the world
yeah I want to know what kind of anime Kim Jong-un watches
mm-hmm all right what is almost certainly porn chase explain the meme to me
uh I can't really tell you did you I ripped out Jay's heart and he became Hitler oh
why did you do that I was I don't get it his avatar is a little nicer than mine
I don't know was it you make him heartless or something at some point
well you think about it it's like a pretty tiny heart so it's not like he was just teetering on
the verge he wasn't using it it's fine yeah it's just it was a waste presented to er for
participating in another efap stream without talking you did it that was for me
you didn't this is uh what he was what he just holo randomly comments on the
nice bold
oh my god we go it's a scumbag steve meme fucking we're going we're going back that takes me back
for sure um hello rags amor visit a tlj defendant would you like some objectivity
and then the fucking guy flips out seems seems normal to me
good old spongebob a group of firefighters and police that were responding to a bee sting were
attacked by a swarm of nearly 40 000 africanized bees this is on in the news damn yeah also someone
in chat said I think it's rags grabbing jay's heart if you look it's clearly a left arm and
only rags is in position for the left arm rags is hot god i don't even know what it refers to
one dino boy oh maybe it's that we all made him evil if that's the point
oh yeah yeah that would sort of hanging out with us yeah
i think that is the intent yeah who would win a long-running successful podcast or one dino boy
yeah one dino boy i mean you've seen the streams where people program him to go faster and faster
the more people type in chat the more followers they get it's i've seen it once is weird but i
think you go literally forever there's such a shitty meme but i love it flag waving a flag
oh so no that's what that fucking the three legs in a cycle means is like kick jay or something
kick jay is just a meme in general the three legs right separate meme and there's lots of
crossover memeage you got to get it all framed out flag of the isle of man
man wait why would the greatness of star wars be these two films i should just do the og
well i guess it's jj abrams oh yes true yeah jj i think that uh i just want to say for anyone who
wants to make a meme uh if you it might help if you use a different font for like who this
character is representing like what movie or whatever because when like the first thing i
see when i look at these is just a low resolution image with the just a just spattered smattered
with text wow chat your memes are amazing they're great chat no don't listen to chase your memes
are amazing he's just being you know yourself i'm picturing chat tearing up on them with patina
on the back like it's okay your memes are great chat i hope everything fucking horrible happens
to you and your mom dies everything horrible happens and your mom dies yeah that that one
especially you need to make sure that one happened in case even if someone hated them
and wanted them dead he'd be like so that wouldn't count as a horrible thing but she dies anyway
rags wants you to say hi yeah hey wholesome quite like this as well uh if president efap chat
is uh it's legally required to be picked at any means necessary for jay now now they want me to
man has become like a symbol of us
oh my goodness don't don't worry chase my mom is already dead good
oh good i'm just kidding i like no all moms all moms stay alive forever
this sweater is a sheep they're just like a lot of they're a lot of sheep and whales
there's quite a few yeah there's probably more capital in most places people all right okay you
know that australia has like 50 million sheep we have a lot of sheep yeah but you're bigger than us
how many right i'm putting this to rest we have more sheep per capita for sure hold on more sheep
than people oh we have more sheep than people it's probably surely whales does i was gonna say
pick capital we probably have more than you right we're known for sheep i'd be very disappointed
australia country with most sheep per this is what it says you you have um 10 million sheep
in wales number of sheep in australia oh my god 75.5 million get fucked we win
you have no like have you ignored what we had rags have said for the past like two minutes pick
capital you fucking idiot how many people are in wales there's like you got google you said
in in mongolia there's like eight sheep per person hold on population population of wales
let's look better population of wales everybody compared to Australia
yeah you have 3.1 million we have about 25 million all right i think we actually win this
i think we win this keep doing math yeah i'm doing the maths okay so 75 divided by 25 is three
oh it's close you have three sheep for every one person yes uh 10 divided by 3.1
um yeah you edge us out by 0.2 you should climb that as a victory you might do that if the if
your numbers favored you you would have been like oh i fucking win yeah but you you said it like it
was a four god did you enjoy fringy's premature celebration did you enjoy that what do you think
about premature celebration no new zealand has three million people at about 60 million sheep
yeah new zealand new zealand is nine and this and this says it's like an eight to one
well mongolia's only got two million people so if they've got like yeah
because by the way for every thousand people you have there are fucking eight thousand sheep
if they wanted to rise up captain scotland can't afford another one of your hangovers
back at base what the fuck is this movie
mauler i posted it i posted a quick little meme that my uh one of my friends made if you felt
like putting it on um what the fuck this is fucking rimbrant over here well i was gonna say
well we'll come back to it oh fuck oh my goodness i just wanted to uh watermelon like this needs to
be addressed why it's a self-referential image why indeed i love the idea is it like an efap
gallerator it's like this piece is called why i call this why yeah next up is uh drunk chase
you realize that that's going to be like your catchphrase now oh i know i've already gotten
like fucking 80 comments on my own content like how do you feel about minorities i just accept it now
it's funny because uh you know of all the things to have chase you around is a meme it's like
uh it's pretty unfortunate but this is my life now if only i didn't say live on a stream
in front of thousands of people i hate minorities only my most comedic moment wasn't also something
makes me look like a fucking terrible person look at that it's efap but lego even chad is there
that's really cute i like that a lot that's cute good job on that i like that a lot
yes one day we'll get the lego adaptation of efap and this is probably how it'll look
so i guess this is like a possible paper mache with like wires or whatever thing but that is
the isle of man uh flag there's a pity there's no paper mache j you know i'm just impressed they
managed to make it stand up on its own yeah that's a feat that's that's a feat maybe maybe
there's some trickery there like there's something behind it that's propping it and we don't see it
well it does have three legs to stand on so i'm not even using all three but you're right yeah
yeah it doesn't need to not sure what to make of this one exactly but um it's kind of neat
a different rendition of me with a triangle as i do no legs though don't know how you look even
creepier yeah it's a creepy element to it for sure the tiny eyes oh this will be good for you
being here chase
see they did like a fucking dragon ball fighters z thing where it was all of us like pasted over
one of the fighters and i forget which one i was but it's just the the clip of me fucking yelling
about joseph anderson's mic and i was like for the love of fucking god back when i had like
the shitty microphones thing as i turn into super saiyan pretty good i think this is from
the same guy who made that the creepy comic where like i go downstairs at night and it's all
all spooky this is just like a happy new year one very sweet lovely and uh i wear little fringy
slippers uh in color they'd be great oh oh look oh that's that's nifty i don't know why i made
fricky slippers but i'm okay with it that's some fucking foreshadowing yeah no and last from this
selection is the there will be more memes so just cutting them up a bit got some kind of i killed
something with black blood i don't know what to make of that but i did it i'm like a knight of
possibly efap or objectivity whatever looking pretty badass you have long legs so it fits i do
thank you very much person who drew this it's pretty badass good job um which brings us
to this reddit thread and i suppose we can all do bits of reading here and there unless one person
wants to take the reins it's not like enormously long but it's gonna be interesting for sure
you got um since shortly after release weekend it's been chorus i've been corresponding with
someone who worked closely on the production of tros and worked for one of the major companies
i cannot disclose here i have verified the source to my satisfaction to protect the source i'm
rewording what we spoke about over the last two weeks and i am submitting it to you in bullet
point format i've written based on what they told me the tldr is that they were upset with
the final product of tros and wanted to share their perspective on how it went down and where
it went wrong so um this is you know all rheumatisms um rheumatoid but it comes from
different people who've revealed things previously that turned out to be true that's kind of the
credence they get so make of it what you will but we are probably going to respond to these things
as if you know there is a level of credence to them see how they match up with things so um
i guess we can go bullet point by bullet point who wants to go first
let's see um
are you doing it so this was bullet points all right so the leakers for the rise of skywalker
had an agenda and are tied to disney directly my source confessed that they have an agenda as well
in that they struggle with ignoring what's been happening to someone who they think doesn't deserve
it not sure exactly what to make of that one do you think of like like luke or like characters
or i think they mean brew rather than characters um i mean i'll i'll throw in the next one jj always
treated everyone on and offset with respect so my sources agenda is that what disney has done to jj
and how much they screwed him over should be something people are at least aware of whether
you like him as a filmmaker or not i mean i could believe that anytime you see like footage he seems
friendly um disney was one of the studios who were in the in that bad robot bidding war last
year disney never had much interest in bad robot as a company but they did in jj because they saw
wb who jj went with in the end as a major threat he did you know that's true
yeah um
anyone else want to jump in yeah disney was one of the studios who were in that uh oh we did that
with jj is very successful at bringing franchises back like mission impossible star trek and star
wars uh i guess warner bros is struggling with dc and aside from wonder woman dc is still seen as
a bit of a joke in its current state by the general audience uh didn't the last star trek lose money
well the last the the last one he didn't direct it's the meme he can bring him back but he can't
maintain them and he can't end them like star trek came back and i think it did well the first one
probably into darkness as well you know i think the first and second one did well but beyond didn't
also chattel if i sound weird it's because i'm i'm sick right now so you're sick boy so i'm a sick
doggo uh i'm fighting off from rotavirus so pardon my occasional nose blowing and cough here and there
you actually sound pretty good so i wouldn't even i don't worry about it i was uh yesterday i've got
two pieces of uh tissue paper in my nose kind of keeps it way it's enjoyable yeah uh can i go next
go ahead and voice actor do oh yeah you can go everyone say goodbye to chase goodbye chase
um wb wants abrams for some dc projects my source said that this is that this generation star wars
is the mcu and marvel's biggest threat is a well operational dc they want to keep dc in the lumbo
that they're in right now abrams jump starting that franchise with something like a successful
audience pleasing superman movie makes them nervous their goal is to make jj look bad to
potential investors slash shareholders that seems kind of ridiculous yeah i'm you go first
i was just gonna say like this sounds really shadowy like i don't know if they'd go this far
yeah that's like too risky that's some conspiracy meme sort of thing like if it is true that's insane
and i'm really curious how much you actually profit if somebody else is bringing incredible
popularity to a genre that you also want to make i think that there's validity to the argument that
if dc is successful that it might cause people to lose interest in uh in the mcu maybe not though
you know it's it's hard to say i would imagine yeah i i guess potentially sure but i don't know
i'm not sure i'm not yeah but i don't know galaxy-brained film marketers you know yeah because if
you have um if you're making your mcu movie and they're making their dc movie are you gonna lose
more from people choosing theirs over years if they can only have one yes because or do you gain
more from bringing more people into the genre well the thing that's worthwhile to remember is
uh when it comes to like movies competing with one another that's definitely a thing because
people are not going to watch every movie so i.e if you have like it was it was a part of the reason
why they didn't want to release um i think i think civil war and uh batman b superman we're
going to come out originally around the same time um and then warner brothers actually pushed up
the release of batman b superman because they didn't want to compete uh with it yeah which
is funny in hindsight because you you think ahead of time like surely you're going to win that battle
right but it's because people don't generally watch like movies every weekend or you know
they'll pick one over the other so it's sort of direct competition let me google that how um
average movies watched for a month all right yeah yeah let's see let's see let's see like for
the average person yeah i'm trying to find out um my guess would probably be like between one and
three for everybody right the average movie then again so the average okay so the average person
watches 20 to 30 movies a year so about once every two weeks
oh that's higher than i thought it was actually more a point than i'd realize uh i didn't realize
that i'm not sure wow really wow yeah that sounds not right to me because i just i just
didn't like they must just go see movies right like it must just be a you know i don't care
what's there let's just go see stuff well does that count like net watching netflix movies and
stuff or oh it might that's the thing yeah okay because i'm talking let's let's see if i can
explain it yeah average movie theater is it uh
let's see um okay actually there's an oh fuck it's on forbs i gotta do the
yeah the whole turn off your ad block thing
usually when websites do that i just find the news on another site
yeah i instantly leave and i never come back
it's like well yes last year this is uh january 25th 2020
americans averaged nearly twice as many trips to the library as to the movie theater
oh okay um libraries are the most popular common cultural activity in the u.s which is actually
kind of nice to hear i was gonna say okay that's good yeah it's not bad news uh american because i
haven't been to a librarian ages but yeah i haven't been to a librarian a long time
uh american adults took an average of 10.5 trips to the libraries across uh 2019 a huge jump up
from the second most popular activity movie theaters with an average of 5.3 trips
yeah that's that sounds right to me yeah that sounds better third is live sporting
events with an average of 4.7 that also that also sounds about right to me
like this is what i mean this is why when it comes to movies you you see people like
wow you know if you watch every mcu movie that's like three out of five of those trips down
it looks like um women are much more like they're women are more likely to visit the library than
men uh 13.4 trips to 7.5 trips men are spending the free time on other stuff so video games probably
yeah uh well in terms of visits like national historical parks casinos museums well yeah
museums national well let's see uh national parks and historical parks
and casinos uh men are twice as likely to do that than women
statistics interesting that's a nice little uh nice little uh
divergent hey fringy do you want to do the next bullet point i do actually god uh oh boy here we
go uh my source mentioned this shortly after the premiere the rise of skywalker we saw last
uh last night was not the rise of skywalker we thought we worked on that is something
we've heard a few times that makes a lot of sense considering the many versions that apparently
existed yeah of course um but hit but the next part here jj was devastated and blindsided by
this he's been feeling down over the last six months because of some of the ridiculous demands
disney had that changed his movie story while the scenes were shot a lot of changes uh a lot of the
changes were made in post-production and the audio was recorded and altered my source said they've
never seen anything like this happen before he's the director and he wasn't in the know about what
they were doing behind his back i mean it would make the most sense that this would be the one
that would be so like committee driven and yeah i can believe it i want to say that after because
you know a company like disney will they'll focus on the trend so they see the trends you know force
wakenes last jedi and then right before that we've um or before the rise of skywalker we got solo
which lost money as a star wars film which they're like oh shit yeah because they're like well the
next step in this you know the procession could be terrible if we don't do this and we got to
reign these people and we got to make the right decision yeah the issue is it's like it came
through late you know also people are asking are we supposed to feel sorry for him it's like well
i mean you know i agree this isn't yeah this isn't cool like it's why is he even there if they're
just gonna do this and you might be like well it's good because he's bad anyways like i don't know
we don't want this to happen to anybody in the industry right even if they are terrible yeah and
i can believe it if if they want to try to make a movie by committee then a part of that will be
management of the movie and everything surrounding it by committee too i want to stress like if a
director was making a horrible decision and the producers were like no no we need to do this other
thing i don't actually mind that process but i do mind it if they just do it behind the person's
back like that lights have to be read in this scene they read now and you look at the final
vision like this is never read it's like it had to be read it's a red get over it it's red so uh
yeah and who knows what contract jj signed who knows what it stipulated maybe he was
blindsided because that's a a normal thing to have in a contract but no one's ever actually
like well he he's worked in the film industry for so long i feel like anything he should he
would know well they could say this hadn't like this is unprecedented right yeah like i said maybe
it's one of those fine print things that's possible but it's never really done
yeah i feel like he's savvy enough though that he would um oh let's move on to the next one
apparently jj felt threatened over the month leading up to the premiere yeah i can see that
yeah i can see that um ryan was never meant to do episode nine despite some rumors that he was
i mean i feel like that was obvious though wasn't it i've not actually heard the rumor that he was
supposed to do nine yeah um hi i like this one jj was brought back by eiger not kathleen kennedy
disney insisted on more fan service less controversy that one i can totally believe
yeah like i can i can see how some old boomer idiot committee would look at the rise of skywalker
and be like everyone will love this yeah i mean they were just they look at force awakers they
look at tlj they'd be like what did force awakers do tlj did that some guy was like
fad service to go okay do fad service more do that again fan service exactly do this again jj
don't forget to push the whopper button jj's original agreement when he signed on was indicating
he would have way more creative control than he did on tfa oh wow i'm assuming oh yeah it
became evident this wasn't the case only a couple of weeks into shooting when the trouble
with meddling started and yes chat i am sick so bear with me uh boy yeah um jj wanted to do some
scenes he thought were important but disney shut it down citing budgetary reasons ah sounds like
bullshit yeah that sounds like bullshit may 2019 jj argued those scenes were crucial he had to let
go of one of the scenes the other scene he insisted on was approved at first um he did
reshoots and additional photography in july the new scene was shot um in october
wow wow like it wasn't the last shadow i'd start filming in 2015 i like well ahead but with this
one that's like shooting wow um oh this was a rush job we know that much oh yes um oh and that
that aligns with the next one the ending will blow your mind was a part of this the older actors
were included like hayden ewen and uh sam o jackson and anyone who wasn't animated the force ghosts
weren't meant to be voices they shot that footage on camera the actors were in costume ray was
supposed to be surrounded by the force ghost to serve as a sort of barrier between her and the
six surrounding them okay so question time would that have been yeah i don't even know at this
point because at least we'd be like oh look people we like i'm i don't know if that would be better
or worse i mean essentially the same thing happened in the all the force ghosts helped
there is just would it be worse to actually see them uh-huh i don't know i don't know yeah i don't
even yeah i have a feeling it's like we know that they're we know that they're there in spirit
so for people like us who like know it would only be an aesthetic thing
i'm wondering if a normie would be like oh look the force ghosts are here
and i'm wondering why yes that fucks up force ghosts even further by saying oh yeah everyone
i guess they were going for the whole you know use the force luke kind of moment right
like that was what they were going for i guess yeah i don't know um joined with all of the jedi
uh oh this next one's interesting um my source thinks but can't 100 confirmed that this is
because of china it's an office talk of sorts some vfx people claim they got a list of approved
shades of blue they could use on the luke force ghosts cutting this out was when the bad blood
turned into nightmare fuel for jj because the movie he was making was suddenly unrecognizable
to him in almost every way i can believe it fuck china uh wait so they cut out the force ghosts
because of china well it's probably just that's an example of the kind of cultural demands that
china makes on these companies and that they count out well the thing is is china doesn't
like make the demands it's more that a lot of film companies will make changes seeking to
make more money from you know chinese filmgoers yeah but they know that everything has to be
approved by the government i just oh yeah so approved shades of blue to be really funny so
yeah so if they're passing along a list of approved blue shades i'm pretty i'm almost
certainly they got that from someone above them sure um i guess the thing is is what what i it's
it's something that i happen like the transformer series they started very heavily trying to appeal
to china and the trade-off is you make a lot of money in china but the consequence is that you
don't make a lot of money in the west generally seems to be what happened and it's funny because
if they were doing this to appeal to china it didn't work because it didn't do very well in china
at all no the last jedi yeah yeah yeah somebody linked so this is kind of uh part of it
this uh the links jj's uh mary and brandon less than three months to work on episode nine
ah three less months to work on it yeah three months to edit a movie that's a
fucking nightmare i need longer than that to edit my videos that's a short amount of
time you'd have to be working around the clock that's like that's some crunch time um and
apparently the last jedi was finished five months ahead of schedule whereas this movie obviously
was finished like just in time and even then yeah oh my god it's crazy how it could simultaneously
look incredibly expensive and yet be so rushed at the same time they needed to take their time for
this water they just didn't i don't know why yeah why not take an extra year why not they wanted to
make one every two years because that's you know it seems so arbitrary well the the reason why and
you know the reason why would be because when you you know when when you like publish your own
because disney's a publicly traded company so anytime they're releasing their you know stuff
for investors if they say like star wars is delayed to next year people are going to start
selling their stock i gotta imagine it was absolutely to appease shareholders yeah maybe
yeah which again i understand that from a business sense but at the same time surely it would be
better to accept that short-term loss yeah but again like i assume that these guys know this
like this is disney this is what they do they're a company that make lots of money so they must have
had some idea what they were doing right like that next one's uh interesting yeah my source
knows jj well enough to know that he's not the yelling type but apparently in a meeting he
yelled something along the lines of why don't you just put directed and written by lucas film then
my source wasn't present for that exchange but knows some who were oh that's interesting i hope
that's true that's funny yeah that's true i could i can see it happening like uh yeah if he's
frustrated and i don't know if jj i don't maybe it's because he doesn't change abrams he probably
isn't used to being treated like this ever no he especially not in his position he's like one of
the most highest paid directors in the world he's like yeah i mean he is probably like modern day
spielberg in the sense of um not not from the perspective i like his movies but in the perspective
that he's a very prominent filmmaker yeah i mean think about his box office returns at this point
because your mission how much money is just generated because he's been he's been like the
showrunner of three really successful tv shows three yeah and mission impossible three uh two
big star trek movies star wars now he's got a 500 million dollar contract with like one of brothers
you know he's not this is yeah this would be like even the video game industry you got like a war
inspector or something no not even that like if you got if you got like heder kojima and you were
just like yeah you don't get to do whatever you want you know we're in charge you know you're here
for the day but yeah we call the shots here you don't get to do it yeah and yet it's like the
exact opposite he got given complete creative freedom to do whatever a lot of people want to
clarify the spielberg things if freaky's definitely not saying he's just talented to spielberg i'm not
saying yeah sorry i should have made that clearer i mean in the sense that he is very
successful not in the sense that i think that he's as good he's not as good as spielberg not even
no um anyone want to go next ah sure i will continue uh disney demanded they shoot some
scenes that would have things in it for merchandise they fly now is one of them it's also
his least favorite scene at a november screening of a two-hour 37 cut he critters groan and laughed
with the scene this time that's hilarious because the reaction that the world had to that scene
yeah it's like he's they fly now they fly now such a bad scene
oh
what exactly would be the merchandise there the jetpack people
maybe you can have they fly now as a meme on a shirt yeah the snow the sand automobiles
fucking stupid yeah the sandmobile was probably like a toy thing i had a comment on my video
saying that i clearly know nothing about land vehicles and they followed up with um
those treaded tracks are actually going to be more useful a lot of the time than a speeder
and i was like why would it be more useful if we're talking about vehicles that also have to
touch the ground but the vehicle doesn't have to touch the ground surely that's the best option
all the time right like i just i just figured that the speeder will be more useful across more
ground especially on a desert than treaded tracks will be ground is irrelevant to a speeder isn't
it like it doesn't touch the ground that's kind of the point it trends is that it's an improvement
on wheels in certain kinds of terrain but if you don't even have to worry about touching the ground
and like that was the point my video was just that it just seems if everybody was
forced to use those things because for a lack of vehicles like okay but it's implied that like
the first order have more resources than there but yet end up with what i consider to be a far
lesser vehicle but it's just like okay and the whole the thing that it does when it
kicks up the backside so the jetpack dude can boost up i was like what a stupid stupid thing
uh oh i see something later in this thread that absolutely vindicates jj that i saw people giving
them shit for it that's interesting well let's keep going keep going down the list yeah uh my
sources say that jj was most likely not joking when he said you're right in the interview where
they asked him about the rise of skywalker criticism um not much to say there i've seen
i can believe that there's a lot of ways you can interpret it but i mean um jj's original early
november cut was three hours two minutes long that feels like a more appropriate run time for
what's meant to be the last movie in the saga yeah especially with all the places yeah there
here getting this meeting this person's place um in january jj suggested they turn this into two films
seems like a good idea my source told me uh this well before terry i can't terry oh is it
is that terry i mentioned it in an interview a couple of days ago when disney said no jj was
content with making this three hours long yeah i mean it probably would have with the amount of
stuff you need to wrap up like yeah you need two movies i would say i think it's actually a problem
i think it's a problem with because it's funny we always bemoan you know we bemoan when like
twilight or harry potter and stuff started splitting one book into two but the reason
why that was kind of annoying was because there was a cynical motive behind it and also it was
one book initially that you just sort of cutting it off and expanding we assume a cynical nature
but nowadays we just like the reverse is almost the cynical one it's like no we just want to get
yeah because i think when it comes to there's something i've definitely experienced where it's
like if there's like a story idea it balloons to a point that at some stage you have to be like
no like i need an extra one i can't finish it like this you know what i mean it's like we can
only do so much screen time for these ideas yes the idea being that like the story naturally
reaches a point where it just is a certain length and then you need to yeah i mean they
definitely needed two movies after but i guess they were like no it needs to be trilogies nice
neat trilogies um but yeah you needed two movies for this one and even then you know
over a period of nine months jj started realizing that one by one his ideas and whole scenes were
being thrown out the window or entirely altered by people who have no business meddling with the
creatives they were not on the same page when it came to creative decisions and it became obvious
that disney had an agenda in addition to wanting to please shareholders yeah disney could afford
messing up nine uh for the sake of the bigger picture when it came to protecting things unrelated
to nine why would be the one you're happy to risk yeah feels like that's the one you need to nail
because it's the bookend sort of thing but i guess not yeah um they wouldn't oh uh the cut
jj eventually and hesitantly agreed to in early december was two hours and 37 minutes long
it wasn't the cut we saw which you wouldn't have approved of uh and which is two hours 22 minutes
long apart from the force ghost there were other crucial and emotional scenes missing
that cut the release uh looked chopped and uh taped back together with weak scotch tape
oh the cut they released looked chopped and taped back together with weak you have to wonder if with
if with more stuff that the film would be stronger or weaker you know i i can't see how it could be
any weaker with more honestly i think i don't know what if they kept the whole lad does is the dad
of jada thing yeah but like i don't know yeah i guess but i actually feel better off without
that being the case yeah um the movie opened with raze training her first scene with rose was shortly
after ray damaged bb8 during the training rose made a silly joke about how po was going to kill
her for damaging bb8 there was a moment where ray took a minute to process what just happened when
she saw that vision during training she looked distressed and worried the next scene was noise
as the falcon was landing and ray runs over uh those two women who kissed at the end were visible
in this shot and holding hands one of them ran towards the falcon as it landed it just sounds
like sort of stuff at that point isn't it yeah um kylo and mustafar scene was two minutes longer
there was a moment where uh kylo seemed a bit dizzy and his vision was shown as blurry for a
second almost as if time stopped when everyone was in the uh in the background with slo-mo fighting
kylo hears vader's breathing and shakes his head and time goes back to moving at a normal pace and
he jumps right back into the battle the scene of the trailer where the guy knocks uh where he knocks
that guy down which did end up in the movie later okay oh thank god they kept that oh god this next
part they cut some of the scenes of the light speed skipping some of the planets that were cut
with kashik nebu and camino oh my god just like service out there like wow i i wouldn't be surprised
if when they got to kashik they just fly past a wookiee good whoa like yeah just be like what
yeah like maybe he's sitting there drinking like a bowl of soup and he just drops the soup out of
you know while he's staring at it like slack jord they go through jackster
dexter is his dire they like just go straight through it
god that's so stupid um the scene where the tie fighters are chasing them through the ice
big uh those corridors were inspired by a video game jj used to play used to play in the 90s called
rebel assault two okay ah that's kind of nifty yeah jhana was confirmed to be lando's daughter
yeah i mean that was obvious you know ray not only healed kylo's face scar but she killed kylo when
she healed ben okay kylo ceased to exist when ray healed him i don't that's not like is that how
people that's not how people work my source mentioned that some people assume it was hard
solo who healed him but that isn't the manifestation of his own sorry that isn't true and that wasn't
hon solo that was leya using that was leya using her own memories as well as ben's to create a
physical manifestation of his own thoughts to nudge him towards he knew what he needed to do
jesus wow that was her own way of communicating that with him and it wasn't possible without her
dying in the process okay she made the ultimate sacrifice for his son and this flew over people's
heads with the disney cut i don't i mean i feel like even that's really dumb yeah yeah man she
could just fuck she's like snoke too i mean i do agree that it's very esoteric in the uh in the
disney cut but still like that's that's i don't know it's weird um oh oh boy yeah this is the one
that um that i think vindicates jay jay you remember how on twitter everybody's like oh
jay jay cut and rose out of the movie how disrespectful of him is what it says the late
november cut the last cut jay jay proved up had scenes with rose and ray still uh jay jay wanted
to give her a more meaningful arc disney felt that it was too risky too my source mentioned
that chris terrio said uh that it was because of the layer scenes but this is only partially true
because she had four other scenes including two with ray slash daisy that layer was not in
that's pretty hilarious if disney thought was too risky to have rose
yeah and it backfired kind of on them socially anyway i mean people go for some reason people
like that shitty worthless awful character yeah like i don't think i would have like liked the
movie more if she wasn't in it at all it's just that yeah well it's just funny because people
like oh jay jay cut her out it's like apparently he didn't apparently he had he had stuff in but
and then he said yeah this is good and then in the interim month somebody else walked in
they're like yeah this is not good get rid of it get her out oh um oh fin wanting to tell ray
something was always meant to be forced sensitivity in the three-hour cut it's explicitly stated there
was a moment when janet and he were running on top of that star destroyer and fin needed to unlock
or move something and he force moved he force moved it and acted surprised when it happened
he was replaced with a cgi bb8 fixing whatever he needed to fix on there well i think that was a
good change if he just managed to unlock something i'd be pretty disappointed if you just randomly
tossed that shit in there so it's like oh he could he could use force now okay i mean you'd think
that he would have told her a lot earlier yeah it would have been so cool to have committed to
the whole stormtrooper trying to get back to normal life sort of thing while also having
realized that he's force sensitive there's so much you could do with that across this trilogy
biggest wasted potential and in the whole series yeah um oh barbie frick was nearly cut because some
execs at disney thought he would be the new cha cha they were really surprised that people love him
this much it was jay jay's create uh idea and was created in collaboration with some artists and
puppeteers the personality was all jay jay i mean he's not a good character like we laugh at him
in a kind of ironic way he's shit he's terrible he's funny oh um there were
a bunch of scenes where ray and kylo separately went through quiet moments of reflection to deal
with what they were going through on her part her going through the realization that there's
something sinister about it uh past him going through regret and remorse but trying to shut
it out my source said that the kylo scenes were especially amazing because of adamus performance
and how he managed to portray that in a turmoil it provided much more context and added deeper
meaning to both his battle with ray and the final redemption arc in the end uh it didn't
happen so suddenly and was more structured than what we got well what do you think of that um i
can believe that he was acting amazingly well i don't think i can believe the kylo ren story
would have been it's just such a mess having moments where he's more reflective of different
things you never know what's going on in his head like that's the whole thing you're just sitting
there like i wonder what he's thinking now is it that he's gonna kill good guys or bad guys
he's so why is he trying why is he like reflective like this what's causing the
what's causing my video the second he found out that vader's voice was
bullshit the whole time that should have ruined his whole world yeah but he didn't care he was like
yeah this movie's stupid isn't it the the kylo ray scene where he dies was at least four minutes
longer with more dialogue ben was always supposed to die sources also added uh that if he wasn't then
he might have been in an earlier drop which they haven't read the first drop they read included
lando the first few didn't the ray low kiss and ben's death was not was not a part of the reshoots
it was part of the re-editing even the cut that jj thought was coming out earlier this month had
a longer version of that scene than what was shown in the theatrical cut jj was against the
ray low kiss this is disney's attempt to please please both sides of the fandom yeah they pleased
the crazy people well wait neither of the significant sides of the fandom wanted ray low
that's like a weird subset i love that it wasn't his idea out there wow like wow oh this next one
is a real good jj was not happy with where tlj took the story the final result is a mix of that
story and the story told by disney and whoever they tried to impress certainly not the fans
jj is gutted over the final result star wars means a lot to him he had to sacrifice large
chunks of the story in tfa but he was promised more creative control in the rise of skywalker
and instead the leash they had him on was tightened this time went by a source said that this is um
this is the one franchise and the one piece of work that he didn't want to mess up and instead
it turned into his worst nightmare when they found out that he was blindsided uh when he found out
that he was blindsided with the cut they presented he said what the fuck when kylo was fighting the
nights of red at the end and the william's music that was used for it was not what he wanted to
at all he seemed to think it was out of place i hope that's true so i wonder when will be the time
when jj with all of his fuck you money and fuck you prestige just comes out and says all right
here's what happened yeah he just officially goes out on the record and says here's what disney did
it'll be a few years from now whenever his contractor nda expires um assuming it has an
expiry and like what if they're like we'll kill your family if you have to say anything
uh jj's cut still exists and will always exist uh we most likely will never see it unless somebody
accidentally leaks it so it's like the snider cut of the star wars that's pretty crazy you'll be
interested to see how much worse or better it is man i hope i hope it comes out i would like to
see it i would like to see it out of morbid curiosity yeah um i feel bad for reading this
this sounds horrible it's like this was his thing that he really wanted to make good and he couldn't
top colors so this is going down in history is the worst managed franchise of trilogy
in film ever just reeks of executive meddling yeah i mean god this this is horrendous like imagine
god but we got one more yes you somebody else wants to read that oh it's like the faded one
right they're all faded they're not all faded no the edit i forgot one thing including finn and po
part all right um the source asked about finpo after seeing oscar isaac's comment about how
disney didn't want it to be a thing this is true jj fought to make this happen this is why oscar
is blaming disney it's not just a random throwaway comment he knows for a fact that it was disney
because these discussions happen the main cast is insanely close with jj and are just as pissed
though seemingly more outspoken about it than jj during tfa disney was hesitant to hire john
boyega because a woman was front and center so they deemed that risky enough and a male
lead whose black made them nervous oh my god oh my god this is so embarrassing interesting because
oh people don't like people don't give a shit i'd like to think they don't give a shit this is
silly china cares maybe that's one of the reasons is because they know that china would care
this is insane this is not it's just funny you ask anybody what the biggest loss of the franchise
was it's like they didn't give the black protagonist a good fucking character that's the whole problem
uh then it says uh jj fought to make that happen for about nine months before getting approval
the same issue came up when jj fought to have fin and poe and truss but he lost that battle as
he lost many creative battles for this film many people jj included came to the realization during
this production that the story really is told by shareholders and investors instead of the creatives
or anyone at disney specifically he tried to make a lot of things happen and was shut down
because of this they had him on a leash and many blamed tlj for the stricter creative approach i
could guarantee that that's why disney would have seen what happened and then they were like yeah
we shouldn't be giving them so much creative control but it's like they got it backwards
i just find a sense of it yeah creative control is fine as long as you have a good creator
what a shame yeah i mean it's when you read that last one it's like oh man just crushing them as
they realize what this industry is like seemingly like right in front of their very eyes see like
i just have to figure that if jj really is invested in the creative side of all of this
like why don't you just start making his own stuff like entirely like nolan sort of thing
or at least closer to what nolan does because he's signed on to make a bunch of dc movies now
right for with one yeah but i guess i guess his whole thing is he likes to make other people's
things that just seems to be his thing when it comes to movies he loves to make other people's
content which is weird yeah yeah it's unusual but you know whatever hey chase you're still alive
yeah i'm here i just had literally nothing to add i was listening fucking idiot no those memes
some sometimes when i'm a guest i'm just like oh yeah i should probably say something that's real
like i'm listening to you better i wonder how much of the story they took out of the movie to put in
fortnite ah maybe the tale crawls twice as long they just put the first half in fortnite
um yeah is that people making that joke because i always reply to him and tell me stupid
i i absolutely believe that a lot of this is true oh yeah the the the name jonun watches uh efap
i agree i'm glad that fringy believes these rumors are true oh sorry i meant no yeah according to
writer chris terrio the idea of bringing back palpatine was producer kathleen kennedy's idea
oh god whoa i guess
your ranks is a format you can totally use i haven't shown that to you already i feel like i
might have oh i kind of like that well yeah let me save that the amazing things we can put in there
oh my goodness let me send this to the name repository rax recommends pooping with the door closed
um once you try it you can't go back pretty awesome screenshot from an old movie
i'm assuming it's not real right because that looks pretty convincing it's pretty good this is
an episode uh six attack of the ewoks here at the space bar and the ewok is drinking way too much
same format different meme the possibility molar is ignoring anime memes to suppress
weave culture the other possibility molar could be saving them with the anime stream
what is this anime stream i've never said anything like that nonsense you know what you know what i
was genuinely thinking would be interesting if you and me and and maybe fringy and anyone else
who might be interested i honestly think rags would enjoy it too if he hasn't seen death note
we could just sit down and just like record highlights from us watching death note and then
you can put it up as like a patreon exclusive so you wouldn't have to worry about any demonetization
molar the chat isn't ready for our anime takes no i i would really enjoy it i'm sure a lot of
other people would too i have a lot of other people message me like please have them watch
anime and i in chat just so you know i did tell molar that we need to watch the live action death
note for e-fat movie yes well is it would you think it would be better if we watch death note
first or that we know how they fuck it up rags i don't know if i wouldn't invest that much time
it's not that fucking long you'll get through in like a weekend many seasons
that's one oh okay oh wow it's like uh it's like a little over 30 episodes i want to say but
every episode is like oh fuck i need to know what happens next
your opinion oh really well done fuck off i like this meme though
good
am i a nazi now part man old bush
the future of future part man
part those memes those memes genuinely make me like appreciate jeb

articles that are going to be read on this written about this video
this is this what's weird is that this is an ironically an excellent way to get relations
between two and guys you know four more turns it's definitely like on the table like this
four more years another term like just that's potentially gonna happen this is amazing
yeah because we're big allies with india so looking forward to being with my great friends
in india he says as he tweets this i love how he said we've got great friends in india it's all
caps lock for india i don't i don't know if this is uh i don't know if this is like trump's idea
or if someone's like advising him like this is the way the internet is even if you don't get it
you know this is what the like and he fucking does it i think this is amazing he was like oh this is
funny

in order to find him hilarious i do love that the dog meme has like the white crop bits that are
like all fucked up i just like the uh the rendition of the nazi flag i think it's great
reminds me of the old man flag i didn't realize that
check it out from ralph ridd and movie man le formar le formar you find it boring you're a
moron this is supposed to be alfred dreamlike logic it was as deep as my soul we watched um
did you call him ralph ridd we did watch high talks movie that was funny it was really awful
wow do you not understand the greater textual thematic nature of the video

you know it's it's funny because it's like whenever whenever i like discover that there's
uh an internet celebrity in so many words within like my immediate network i always like just
expect sort of pompousness and like oh don't talk to me i can't be seen talking to smaller
people like you but i just remember i messaged i messaged logic and i was just like yeah i like
your content dude he's like thanks man he just like sent me a friend request and i was like what
a nice guy we kind of met him because of the last jedi in a way yeah oh that was so strange
that stream do you remember that like yeah we had um yeah we were on one of the streams and paul
agea was on there um he's uh he's an atheist youtuber i like him uh and he had worked on set uh
he did stuff for the original for the uh for prequel trilogy he actually worked on those
he had a lot of interesting stories and we like shat on the last jedi
and he wasn't quite on the same page no but it was a fun conversation from what i remember
yes she owed it'd be our rewrite of the movie i like it better already
massive man a tone look movie jflix from doggo driver at rido hunter
oh don't go driver same movie
you can't go one meme selection without at least one doom meme
we don't know how many people make doom memes it just seems to work doom is super meme-able
um you should have had um you should have had it as um oh my god i the don you should have had the
don as doom guy well it changes between and all the all the uh the different like because the don
and and you know big idiots and tonal they're all very powerful characters
oh someone got a screenshot of rag as well he's playing video games
ha look at the face
who are you ray ray who ray palpatine
oh hey she meant to do it this time yay progress of a kind oh my god new movie coming out
have you guys have you seen this rags the doggo
i think that's diabito he's got the chocolate hey doctor dia dia butt nick
he's got cheese he's got the cake helicopters pizza doughnuts i think his drone is like a
big or something i don't know he can drumsticks can can rags defeat him i guess we'll find out
that's the mustache hey bro what's look at what i wrote space balls is a funny
kick jade indeed
what is this long long black man and drunken rags watching taxi driver wrong
he's a doggo that wouldn't take it anymore regular folk watching taxi driver right
awash in fields that's a very simple meme but i understand the point
yeah we are evilmen for not liking it well check this out when we were defeated by diabeto
temporarily i think oh no drawing the sugar out of our body oh i'm not so much healthier though
these names is a golden so many of them too star wars romance pay 59 harassing black people for
having a jab jab at a porg jabby and jab got to make sure there's a distinction
it's a pretty simple one last thing you consume rags is not buying it
as if we put this one up before it was straight out of eddle
oh
this is from the the knights of efap guy he made uh
he has like the figurine version of all of us that would come out oh that's cool i feel
like you could legitimately get away with buying long man merchandise or selling long
man merchandise like i would totally buy a fucking little model of uh of mauler how about
you guys what do you think you know figurine yeah just like a fucking star wars type of figurine
but it's just you looking like kind of vader esk i'd buy that shit i don't know how one goes about
selling something like that i'm not a campany i don't know how to do you've got the you got the
fucking odd ones out the odd ones out has merchandise so you know yeah like toys living
with yourself so you know that clone decision that clone thing had to stay in power too because of the
themes um so he's looking at lips fucking i love man spotted in a video game oh my god
i know this meme so dr who i'd buy that i'd buy one i'd buy that
is for a lot depends on the context efaps no actual videos yes
what about a little mueller it's mauler but cap oh it's kind of cute
i'll show you cute check out this here yes please
oh god
god what is this creature tlj defenders defending tlj by saying truss will fix everything tlj defenders
i don't think the people who like tlj felt it didn't need fixing you know
i want to say very quickly before we move on to the next meme mauler i uh someone made a point
that jojo is for normies and they're not entirely wrong but uh that's definitely selling it short
basically every episode of jojo and it's cool because it's like each season goes chronologically
it follows the same lineage of the joestar family and you kind of see them all interact
and branch out and have different families and you know uh basically every episode sometimes
it's like a two or three parter where it's like they they find this insurmountable obstacle of
a foe and like their powers completely counter theirs and it's just very like it just kind of
climbs and climbs and climbs into this climax where it's like okay there's no fucking possible
way that they could ever get out of this situation and then in the middle of the next episode it's
like okay they came up with like an ingenious super clever macGyver-esque way to just immediately
mitigate the threat and escape sometimes people die so there's always that game of thrones sort
of tension on the line where it's like who might we lose but uh it's pretty great very actiony very
funny and comedic and uh you have like a timer where it resets once every time you pitch anime
and then we have to wait until it reaches zero oh is she's talking about anime he's pitching anime
again just jojo it's okay just trying to teach him how to be a cool trendyman oh i gotta watch an
anime and then i'll be a cool trendyman is that how that works i've already seen an anime j i mean
j see this is what's happening you get i think you gotta pay attention to the one that everyone is
talking about and then watch it and then either agree that it's great or shit on it with a hot
take and get everyone pissed off but attract all the contrarians until you watch loads of normie
media uh i won't have to ask you you accept you making me watch non-normie media it's the exchange
okay you gotta go watch every episode of doctor who star trek and including season one like the
og doctor who says every last thing i haven't even seen them but i know that you have to it's like a
fucking goofy fucking low budget james bond it's like it's like uh fucking what was the movie
where it was like the spy who shagged me i'm forgetting right now wait you think that's awesome
powers yeah yeah that's what the first fucking that's what the first season of doctor who feels
like it's just super goofy i think it's like season seven or something where he caught on doctor
who's fantastic no not doctor who awesome powers all right next anime is good watch it mean oh man
it's taxi driver but with rags little hat i stream 12 hours a day and i can't sleep
drink three cans of beer to sleep damn i don't believe the juice could be angry copy you're
submitting juice came here drag is i get it oh hey we got some seepage over some memes from
jay's tisms with with no bullshit ew seepage jay's son always remember debates are gay and so is twitter
true uh scientifically tested debates are gay i'm sorry for what i'm about to do wolf gone
i don't have a choice wait you don't have to
uh
this is fucking great but the welsh flag is beyond your artistic capabilities you draw dragon
um
oh god
oh hey this is pretty cool it's when we all did that dance together
what was the original meme of that it sounds really familiar it's like the sex offender
shovel yeah yeah i think it is the sex offender shovel sorry about this meme ranks but it was
submitted what am i gonna do
the veins really fucking sell that image too oh my goodness this fucking showdown
that's like wow anime memes will never get it to efabs since bowler is a culture
slap it together you don't have to hey we showed play of anime memes i refuse this criticism
that's actually kind of relevant too because in that show there's like a fucking stand that can
pop in and out of photographs and so it's like if you close it up it can't get out
point being they don't have to go up it's great i guess if you say williams in a funny way it
ends up as williams i would prefer that look for him what with a hat yeah i feel i got
i feel i'd be able to respect his craft more yeah i can agree with that
under the er one while he's on efap he's too weak his own videos unlimited i agree with this
statement someone added me in chat said thanks chase you ruined it fuck you oh i don't care
i hate each and every one of you i think i'm describing that as a glory hole of wonder at some
point glory hole of wonder you never know what you call of wonder honestly if a glory hole had
a rainbow like that i would be very interested you just you put it right in i like this rendition
of chat yeah that's kind of how i see chat actually like you you reading it and responding
to it is the trap and then they swallow you right up first you read it then you die oh cool
this is a uh this is a shot from one of remarkable republicans newer videos i think would anyone like
to read this out let's see wait can i do it yeah um a bullqueer well bullqueer defined a bullqueer
is a gay man who forces himself on others bullqueers are common in prison she palpatine is a
bullqueer in both a literal and metaphorical sense and he behaves as such in all nine films
in addition palpatine employs more traditional homosexual tactics and ruses such as manipulation
and deceit there you go guys yeah i mean pretty open and shut i'd say it's the strongest logic
you're going to find um also they managed the whole queer is a gay man who forces himself on
oh we have a word for that it's a rapist oh yeah um they managed to see the original title it got
leaked why women should not vote
um but a child's parents die at a media but people won't compare it to harry potter excuse me
much like harry pooper oh check it out coming over will you be long
very long maulers what is this from i don't know that's a very good question there was once a
young doggo named rags who preferred not to poop into bags so on the throne he would sit in our
bathroom well lit and exclaim close the fucking door you fags no it's in fairness it's uh it's
important that you know rules are followed i think that's what rags is trying to say look
every little step keeps us away from barbarism who said it a problem with building a political
philosophy around personal responsibility is most people actually don't know what's best for them
are you sure that was bob holy crap the fact that it's even in doubt like her said that
we spent like four hours trying to figure out which quotes for his which ones are dazis that's
all they had to do was put it in grayscale next to hitler and stall and it's just like i mean
it's uncanny you know like which one do i shoot they'll look the same you know it's like uh
look if i was if i was stuck in a room with hitler stalling a movie bob and i had a gun with two
bullets in it i shoot bob twice i know i thought you're gonna subvert since i shoot yourself twice
what no i was gonna be bothering you i'm not gonna let bob win
how do you know bullets will stop him i don't know get out of here
you shoot him and he doesn't die
like it gets soaked up and it you're
what no it's like an idea it's like the t-1000 you just shoot it and then
you're just like no no and then you know you suffer for eternity
this um i guess an alternate dimension rags oh my goodness yeah that's horrifying
he's looking angry at something maybe he's possessed i don't know
it's weird because like we're one his left arm is just one finger i guess the claw
the claw the claw this this this is going on for me i don't want to make a bit i'm a
a true diet alien man look at those packs look at palpatine
that's who that is you'd know if you knew star wars and you weren't some kind of not normie
god yeah that's true i decided it was like the person who drew it but they drew themselves as
like a sort of like a chubby old lady or something literally how dare you call that
youtube reset the title and description of this stream so just knocked out all the links
to you guys's channels now it's like oh no hold up i i've got a copy paste of the whole thing
oh well i can i'll fix it while we're uh well when this other thing's on screen
but uh it's just like youtube what are you doing buddy
uh
the virgin no bullshit
actually guinea pig
bobs channel name is inaccurate constantly spews bullshit
get suspicious with wibbiter
uses you i like uses power put it like a boss
fine with women in movies so long as they're hotter than gary fish
admits when he's wrong about robo-coffin vader
the alpha shadow nickname auntie
channel name accurate is a remarkable republican wow i mean you can say that again
oh this is a cool one
a 55 ephaps is my thesis
and glad orations glad you belt i don't even know what the context is but i think it's probably
we're all pretty drunk clap a clap a clap a belch thank god look at your face though the
yeah it's like it's me turning my head to belch
oh it is yeah is that's it is that supposed to be like an evangelicalian thing like was there
any other dimension to that or was it just the congratulations clapping thing i really don't know
glad orations memes there's just a the big evangelicalian meme is like in the last episode
the main character shows them in front of everyone saying congratulations in clapping
so i i'm pretty sure that's referencing that why did somebody draw this
you got some very square effects there
if you remember this quote from movie bob
at the end of the day they just bowed and beat oh my goodness that's actually really that's
really good that's a really good drawing yeah terrifying see he could be a dark souls boss at
efap dark souls yeah some strange diablo kind of demon monster
who would fuck you up oh and then look what we jump into next because obviously i wanted to show
people this one no that's nifty i always like that one oh yeah that's great i use that for
my uh profile thing i still got it it's one of my favorite i really like it we're into this i uh
feel like it i got it saved very good really like it the final for this selection i'm i'm not
even 100 sure what's happening you got metal is about to attack tiano reams john wick oh i guess
this relates to the video because he got cheerily in the background as well i like that we're all
on i suppose oh well we're not actually it's this metal no
don't get a cactus so hurt it i like this rendition of me i'm uh
oh well everybody's looking at alternative it's interesting even that's bullshit
yeah i like that one i like how i look like fucking chubby neo or something
he says i hate minorities yeah it's right on the shirt
i love how metal is just permanently drawn as a humanoid pepe that's crying
yeah he's also oh he's using the caca twos from uh from pommel party ah makes sense now uh
i fully understand the meme all right so next up we're actually gonna do some uh
uh video memes there's a selection got a couple it's been a while some video memes i think i'm
gonna ask that you guys just delay chat for a little bit while i saw the description if that's
all right all right okay talk about stuff make them think that there isn't actually a complete
pause right now um well um yeah i'm not sure what to talk about literally everything or
some things i don't want to talk about now yeah well like we don't hmm should we talk about oh
i thought you had i thought you like had something and you're about to open it not really uh it's
just that bernie is one nevada apparently oh that makes sense does it not only that he's one but
he's one like by a considerable margin like a really big margin something like 60 and the
nearest person is like 20 to 15 well who are the uh who the runner-ups running with people uh
so bernie sanders has 54 of the vote right now um biden has 17.9 elizabeth warren has 9.4
pete brooder judge 9.1 and uh tom styer 7.5 i think wait who where's tom styer that's the
millionaire guy yeah clobuchar's not on there oh my goodness they don't even know who she is
she knows i mean the voters know her like she knows the mexican president
poor clorobuchorum yeah no it's um it's uh i don't know like i don't know how they figured
this out but uh wait people in chat saying it's only three percent reporting oh okay well that's
um yeah well then whatever it doesn't mean it's pretty much useless at three percent well i don't
know how it works man i don't know how people like pick who win apparently they do like cool things
at like three percent or ten percent but i mean but if he's leading by that much i mean it seems
unlikely but i guess we'll see i don't know how you saw the last uh the last president of mexico
i actually saw him in person uh a hotel that i was working at he showed up to do this deal
here with some business people because they're gonna big like business arrangement that they
were making with trade and stuff and he showed up to the hotel with all of his security and all
that sort of stuff i'm like oh that's a president that's cool also people i know i was just gonna
say uh people are spamming to uh invite metal to the call cuz he's in chat and i would uh be down
for that if you see you think that i wouldn't have already thought to do that well now metal
is an illman he's got the the big ill oh so high but here yeah but metal you know got bigger ill
you've got you've got uh like maybe i'm just super resilient he's got the big trouble
anyway uh so if you remember stay out of politics fringy yep all right that's fine with me
you fucked it up fringy how could you hey look i don't understand your process to me
caucuses seem like the dumbest fucking idea why don't you just have a fucking boat where everybody
lines up and just puts the fucking ballad in i don't understand this whole thing of gathering
in rooms and spending three hours flipping coins and giving each other ace cards just like boat
do it like every other normal country all right go ahead bring with political hot takes all right
this is uh is this a hot take it's literally about politics therefore it's a hot take ah yeah
you could have just said you have a president they'd be like fucking politics really
but uh yeah last time on spot you're fat
that's j
oh my goodness
i'm gonna go ahead and assume this is oh god look prometheus oh look at this
i guess
hi i'm jj abrams tonight tonight tonight i have dozens of dollars i can't be bothered to go further
with this line if you're thinking but the the it mattered so much and and and to to try and and
continue a story that makes people feel like the world has you know is full of infinite possibility
that you could
when the single creative bone in your body is the tapes just redo what what what you already done
but but bigger and try to blow up 102 planets along the way that's always a plus jj abrams
destroyer of worlds i get it he's done the meme again we just blew up a planet jj stand i like the
butt butt and bigger to try putting those in where jj blew up six star wars planets in his
two films he blew up six on average jj destroys three planets per film not enough needs more
he does on average oh yeah i totally didn't even think of that you're right
you destroyed a few in star trek right
this one i like how it's just like yeah blow up a planet hero there who cares you know it's just
a planet
a different may may
galaxy we're all means nothing nothing nothing we
you
oh wow yeah that's really good
i almost got chills that was so cool that's really cool that's really cool good job man
oh that's really cool but ironically that was epic this shot i think i've asked for like
this screenshot that is going to come up in the next collection of images that's pretty badass wow
how tall are you in real life anyway six foot three or four i haven't checked okay so you are
actually a longman hmm tallman tall taller man how are those without long man genetics too
yeah that's some good shit that's some good show that is very impressive the building is you're
coming out of the dog dog whoever whoever made that if you're hearing this uh tweet at me i
want to know what what program you used to animate that it's probably just like after
effects or something but i'm still curious it's uh yes mad end in chat they're actually here hello
that is no yeah i'm uh i'm just gonna go ahead and subscribe to that channel yeah
this one's called did mauler voice aku aku oh yeah i know you'll get it well this is this is
one of those clear plots that he didn't need to shoot it because it was about to be saved by
why
what does it mean rack
well selected very good called uh pape infighting starting with black panther earlier this year
which had a suspicious amount of female characters and who gives a shit if there's a bunch of women
in the film you get to look for women sexual harassment the suspicious amount of sexual
harassment subscribe to a rhino indeed i'd love to get some of these the suspicious amount of women
whatever here whenever i hear phrases like that i think of the meme of the black guy just
like poking his head like think about it think about it it all makes sense
my we have an elephant joining us ladies and gentlemen i'm rags i just call it smaller rags
oh my goodness
oh that was uh that was a fun stream whichever one that was this is a this is
stiles bounty hunter meme ooh i don't have to worry about
music tisms i'm assuming it's an original soundtrack for the game which means i'm fine
oh my goodness
i can pay you double triple please please don't kill me i'm worse more alive
what a shit show
that's montross i still remember that game is good shit even though you're terrible now
montross trademark fucking deep exhale yeah he the bounty hunter is montross you fight him in the game
um really quickly before you play another one uh-huh uh i just want to say if anyone in chat
can find the quote and and uh send it to me i remember i was playing like a vr game and
listening to the stream where rags got really drunk and i forget exactly what you were responding
to it was it ralph sepe's video awesome yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and someone did a super chat
and mauler read it out loud and it was just like what would you say if jar jar binks took
a shit in your mouth and one of them was like yummy yummy like it was the most fucking ridiculous
sentence i've ever heard come out of mauler's mouth and i need that line of text just so i can
read it in his voice again oh you're asking for people to find you the timestamp because you're
too lazy yes find me the timestamp for that video because that is fucking i never laughed
harder in my entire life at anything there you go if anyone knows it off top of the head tweet at
chaseface.com please i need that shit
time for an efap bites i actually do have that domain believe it or not
holy shit all right i haven't done anything with it yet
a hard part of our fan base have no justifiable right to act out as they have
one of the messages that has always been an underlying tone of the star wars series
for me at least is that no matter how different you look or sound we are all a member of this one
universe whether you like last gen i said just star wars i've never i've watched star wars for
26 years i've never once had that thought yeah that's uh no that's the thing that's why themes
are so just low bar you can make themes out of anything you can connect anything you should be
like oh star wars is always about no matter where you're from we're all a part of the same
thing it'd be like uh what movie did you just watch i don't think that they they glorify that
the dark side members are like that was a thing like they're just slightly different but they're
all welcome into our family like not necessarily i think you have to switch before you can come
over to the cool i don't know is the family themes i totally get but being like it's like
an all-inclusive happy everybody's great sort of that's like i don't think
are the huts portrayed in a way that's anything other than evil
we don't accept the uh the slug people they're not beach body ready
we're all part of this fan base it's up to us to oh yes people hate it
the infection of a once great fandom has to be cured
in fact you know that's quite terrible yeah this infection is gonna be cured
yeah what do you remember the movie bob would say yeah there's a reason why i love how people
unironically say these really ominous things like you know we have to purge the dissenters
from the pool you know it's just like these kind of ominous i want to know i want to know why that
particular youtuber sounds like he's like getting over a stroke just well like with his overall
energy and his uh delivery that was a bad video it was funny as hell though it's literally like
does he sound like that all the time though i don't know but he sounded so emotionally exhausted
sade call man the Muslims in our goddamn holy land that is i can't even express how stupid
we have to retake jerusalem man it's a it's a call for peace right the quell the infection
always say that like as a sports fan these people would never survive
being in sports they would hate you with their plastic oh my god it's just unbelievable that
they think that this is toxic or dangerous it's like go to go to a fucking football game people
just don't like your shit movie so yeah my god man the fact that it comes down to that is so
awkward the whole chat is saying all crusades if you're with me on this journey of reclaiming a
peaceful fandom full of differently as beautiful opinions reclaiming if you're with me on this
journey of reclaiming a peaceful fandom full of different but equally as beautiful opinions
different but equally as beautiful opinions different but equally beautiful opinions
as long as they line up with yours right pal oh as long as they aren't of these equally beautiful
opinions as long as they're positive you will like remember the prequels that was that was
very divisive no it was okay to hate them that's how people usually justify this shit they'll be
like yeah but they were bad yeah yeah and it's like oh honestly like i could see casual viewers
totally like like i i feel like my parents saw the last jet i wish they hadn't seen it
they my dad would be like oh that's that's that's okay i know yeah molar sky runner and then if i
was like why is he on that island dad he'd be like why is he giving up on everything
someone in the chat said my sister's boyfriend loves tlj
there's a lot of people out there that their wives boyfriend really likes tlj i can tell you
that much yeah and enjoy what this video has to offer if not if you're part of the
toxic brood that is recently weird that's toxic bro guys enjoy the video or you're toxic
jeff who always doing the brood uh oh god it's christian and gang grill
so we're the brood i like it the toxic brood i have literally
you couldn't make that shit up like that's just something that sounds like the dumbest
might have ever heard somebody call me i mean i mean but instantly it sets the tone of the video
it's instantly right off the bat either you basically you like this film or you're part
of the toxic brood and you have to be excised from the community like the tumors cancer you are
toxic milk i just love i'm already he's already given me two great quotes for next april fools
i'm like chill out we got a whole year of this before we get into the script we face then i
hope you stay and maybe learn that you can have a different opinion without being some sort of
hate monger oh fucking hell there it is there's some irony jesus we're the hate mongers of the
toxic brood hate mongers oh yeah they're a really sweet uh death metal band yeah
they're great i saw them live and i'm embracing i'm embracing the brood uh embrace the brood
let's own it we're the five founders of the toxic brood
last video defending star wars the last jedi i used the term fans referring to the ones who
put on those who have different opinions oh so we're not sure fans right i'm glad that you are
the arbiter of what a true fan is thank you mr scotsman the ones who claim to be true star wars
fans and say to others you know to choose star wars fan if you didn't hate the last jedi
have you guys ever said that to anyone you're not a true fan no and this is discussion we always
have it's i say this all the time okay okay to like a bad movie
i i i still get i still get eggs thrown at me in public for liking mortal combat annihilation
yeah mortal combat annihilation mortal combat annihilation
of the seven people on the planet um that likes this movie it's not a good movie it's a horrible
film it's total nostalgia for me um like i said with with the mortal combat three um and uh
annihilation boat the point is in the fandom and menace nobody period that has you know
become prominent uh in the uh you know resistance or whatever you want to call it up the last jedi
and disney star wars has said that you can't like the movie nobody has said that nobody has
i have people on my team that like this movie from geese gamers.com there are people that like it
it doesn't make sense in the statement you can't i can't i haven't you excised them like what can i
even do cast a spell that prevents you from feeling no cannot like it it's people that need their
opinion uh you know just they are validated by other people yes and when they can't have
their opinion validated they you're immediately a racist a sexist a misogynist toxic um and you
even though none of that is ever true like you know you can't assume people's politics
because they have an opinion on a movie but that's what these people do
good shit that was really fucking professionally edited yeah they're getting through like all of
the biggest memes i think um yeah brother moves there yeah it's all one guy fucking graphic
articles we've shown quite a few of them now i i think we've shown all of them so far we've got um
wolf reacting to the game of thrones episode three i think it was the the big idiots versus um
Freudian yeah Freudian uh the apex homosexual the pants discussion rhino milk you know building up
that that's gonna be like a really good channel to get into this if you've never heard of it before
this stream i mean explaining all that shit to people accelerated lore so this was one that i
was made aware of it's um yeah obviously at 2019 ended as do you guys we know obviously so
naturally there's an awards for uh the best memes of efap 2018 saw the emergence of the every frame
of pause podcast or efap and with it saw many viewings of silly arguments and a plethora of
memorable memes i'm looking at you rhino milk but in 2019 the first full year of efap we saw a
witness to just as many meme-able moments and thus it seemed like a good idea to take a look
back at some of the best that this wacky show has had to offer you may disagree with some of the
choices but just remember that's subjective which means i can't be wrong but in all seriousness i
probably missed out on some good ones so leave them in the comments and now the top 10 efap memes
of 2019 in my opinion number 10 slice and dice from efap number 25 get a little farther from
your mic to be commended for several reasons that is all not only for encouraging us all to look at
women but for being one of a handful of efap subjects that actually show up for some debate
and thankfully he did because otherwise we would not have gotten him describing how he wanted to
shout slice and dice in the theater after kylo killed snoke in a real rip off of return of the
jedi so distinct was this that mauler would later adapt this phrase with the addition of brothers
to encourage prosperity in the audience number nine what'd you bring me from efap mini batwoman
s01 e04 batwoman is a televisual program that has offered a lot of insanity in the few months
fucking explanations you have to give for each of these videos it's been airing from crappy music
questionable approaches to social justice and a villain that keeps getting away with murder
because the protagonist didn't feel like arresting it's the kind of craze that even the joker would
be taken aback by and yet amongst all of this the mall where batwoman's dad slams down a laptop
and asks batwoman's ex-girlfriend what he has been brought would end up becoming the quintessential
meme of this series of videos there's no reason why that should happen but it did
what'd you bring me not since christian bale in the dark night rises praised by the renowned
chris stuckman has aligned alert with such grit but so damn meme number eight jeb from efap number
59 during the stream set to cover jane nicholson's joker video which is like totally 11 hours guys
wolf brought up the renowned political figure jeb bush this would spur several medea-esque
movie title puns but it would also generate the theory that there was a little jeb inside jenny's
mind that had gotten tired of running around in the wheel powering her mind which may be the only
thing to explain some of the nonsense that had emerged in that video number seven one point two
from efap number 50 the great tonal look is no stranger to efap only a man so odd and yet so
brilliant could enlighten us on artificial barriers of blockage and the horrific nature of
cooked carrots but perhaps the most addictive meme he's generated comes from his disbelief
that gamers would spend such an insane amount of money on gaming and this is definitely one case
where slow and steady wins the list number six y-wings from efap number 47 much like tonal just
right is a pillar of efap enlightening us on reader response theory but his most iconic moment
of the year emerged in a video attempting to disprove objectivity gosh wonder who he was
aiming for there bringing up the infamous bomber scene from star trek the last jedi he attempted
to defend ryan johnson's choice to have the rebellion resistance whatever using those big
ass bomb ships instead of the pre-established y-wings while his attempt to disprove objectivity
throughout the video was pretty weak sauce the point that stood out the most was his claim that
most people do not know what a y-wing is an argument so baffling and insulting to the
audience's intelligence i apparently felt the need to write down my reaction to it months before
efap covered the video but of course it was wolf's rant about afterwards that solidified this as a
line to remember but the cherry on top being that the y-wings would return in the rise of skywalker
just to show that right was wrong one of the few highlights of that film number five what makes
good rat from efap number 47 since efap began many important questions and critical discourse have
been raised is objectivity possible what is the value of lore is water wet but one of the most
vile emerged when brown table posed the question what makes good art however due to questionable
fond choices an even more important question was raised what makes good rats we may never know but
it has been fun to say and the term good rat has since been used to describe works of high quality
including various bits of fan art and memes number four the hate mongers of the toxic brood from efap
number 29 great work is not always appreciated in its day and the community of efap has been called
a lot of things in the relatively short time has been around many of which are pretty hyperbolic
hypocritical or contradicted but perhaps one of the more ironically enduring statements describing
the podcast and the fans is when some guy called aj cariballo 95 decreed that those who would dare
encourage negativity for the last jedi were in fact part of a toxic brood the name has since been
used as a badge of pride as efap continues its assaults of verbal terrorism and hate mongering
number three is lay of man from efap number 54 truly it can be the most random of things that
end up creating memes after a stream looking at quinton with a very sleepy aiden paladin mauler
was encouraged to take a look at the flag for the isle of man a locale not often mentioned having
been exposed to the awesome welsh flag for most of his life his shock and surprise seeing this
three-legged monstrosity be the symbol of people led to one of the most intense bursts of cackling
from the gas mask one which would solidify this as a flag to remember number two long man bad from
efap number 22 after covering enough takes sometimes you just need a phrase to sum up the
majority of the arguments you see and a look at jack saint provided one while he may claim to the
contrary many of the arguments in his mauler takedown ultimately amounted to being pretty basic
without much strong evidence particularly when it came to how length was a primary issue of
badness and thus the popular orange man bad meme used to condense basic generic arguments against
that one guy quinton hates was adapted into long man bad not only has this provided a quick way to
show distaste for certain cheap strawman arguments directed to efap philosophy and long videos in
general but long man would become one of mauler's most enduring nicknames honorable mentions sword
like weapon from efap number 50 big idiots also from efap number 50 the orphan question from efap
number 32 taiwan lannister apex homosexual from efap number 48 although almost anything from the
remarkable republican part of that episode could probably make it in and a late edition and it
would be potential contender for a place in the main list if it had come out earlier from efap
number 67 we have african americans being replaced by ewoks and now number one the dawn from efap
number 36 when the deleted scene of entering that one guy from captain marvel was revealed
the internet was divided some were quite appalled that a hero would use such some were encouraging
and some just didn't care much either way much like the film but through the efap blends the
truth was discovered that the motorcycle guy shown to be called the dawn was in fact the most noble
selfless and awesomest hero of the marvel cinematic universe it was revealed that his seeming sexism
was merely a sign of him showing signs of positivity despite his tragic past yet in spite of various
setbacks the dawn worked to help orphans and charities to make the world a better place
for this he has been granted the official title of god of efap
and has made the number one spot in this list here's to more worthy memes in 2020
yeah it's a good selection that's what i guess yeah it should have had on the dry side but
not bad very very uh um i hate when i fucking get like on stream it's it's important that the memes
are documented yes it's good for the culture but don't don't talk like right here in your mic
because it uh it gets very draining to listen to for a long period of time just would you know about
voice acting chase it's actually fun fact really easy tip for anyone who's trying to record youtube
videos do the do the fucking uh what's the what's it called the surf sub symbol where you extend your
thumb and pinky finger touch your pinky finger to the mic and touch the thumb to your mouth that's
exactly how far away you should your actual mouth yeah to your to your mouth like to the side of
your lip whatever so do you so you you take your thumb goes there yeah because that's like a bent
shape so it's not like a perfect metric but it's you know no it's like it's actually like a perfect
90 degree angle well he makes that work to extend it out so it is like a line yeah like do it as
straight as you can and then put it oh then i don't need the thumb part uh i mean however you
want to do it that's just what they do in the industry why do you why don't i just say a fingers
distance because it's more uh because two and a half fingers of distance the thing so is it
supposed to be where like you you you press your mic with your finger and then your thumb is on
your mouth you don't keep it that way it's just three fingers like distance yeah it's just it's
easier to do the fucking surf sub thing surf so okay so can we do the beautiful joe thing
uh not really because it's not quite the right length but it's no better than nothing no not
really why not because uh it's not it's not what i've been told because i'm pretty because
because your middle finger is a little bit longer but i wonder if that makes any difference are you
talking about like having your knuckles to your mouth and your your middle finger to like pointing
towards the mic well i guess i don't know how to i don't know how to arrange it because because
the thumb comes out at an angle right when you're thinking of the thing
i guess just with your your the back of your other fingers facing upward
just put your thumb to the side of your mouth like to the corner of your mouth
okay and then your your pinky finger just kind of touching the mic in general just need
oh pinky finger so what is what is my index finger doing what's my pointy finger doing
uh nothing
okay did i say index finger somewhere accidentally i don't think you did i thought you did like the
surf sub thing or is that the ready to rock thing you're thinking of the devil horns like
the fucking metal metal yeah the raw symbol yeah surf sub is just the pinky finger of the thumb
this is boring let's move on do you get the idea rags needed to understand it god all right next
meme and i helped him to do so i can hear them now as i've heard them for years space travel is just
an expensive hobby we have so many problems we haven't fixed here yet how can we justify spending
billions on rockets and science experiments when there are so many poor and hungry people still on
earth and i'm supposed to sigh and say that's true and obviously i know those have to be higher
priorities except that would make me a liar yes i want to do what i can to feed the hungry and help
the sick and so on but if we're being truth or dare warts and all soul bearing honest here well
if a genie showed up and handed me two choices peace on earth or cities on mars within my lifetime
well folks i don't think my answer would be the one that wins me a miss america crown jeez to some
people i'm sure that um if so retard if you have peace on earth and like no sickness or hunger i'm
pretty sure all of our systems are going to be running extremely well in terms of production so
like yeah like god you're going to achieve both you get some ozz yeah one almost guarantees the
other but it would literally ensure you would literally ensure that society collectively reaches
self-actualization exactly so like what even if you were being strictly pragmatic like yeah you
should pick peace on earth first well yeah like you're his advisor and he's like i want
cities on mars you should be like oh well yeah we can do that with the other thing if you achieve
peace on earth yeah then we will like just like the idea is it is city on mars but everything is
terrible everyone's dying there's no resources at least ron mars help catch me at my absolute
most bitter and i might point out that since humanity hasn't generally shown me any special
measure of kindness i feel no obligation to do so it's like the ultimate subtweet it's just like
you are fucking mean to me and you are only anything bully me in high school and now i'm
going to bully them yeah it's just like he i'll bet when he's scripting that he's just like that'll
fucking show him people should really be nicer people are going to think i'm such an enlightened
badass if there was anyone who was like did bob really say the things that he that we show to
those tweets it's like yes yes yes oh god i love the continued marching i'll figure out quote is
from a nazi i always press x to bulb i just like how even with all the backlash he gets every
fucking day he still just decides to tweet out like i don't like nazis and bad people and i don't
agree with any of anything they say it's just like yeah go on bob yeah also um time for a new
plague creations video oh really
fuck it's so good already he's almost becoming a case study for the theme critics like we're in
lab coats watching his struggle we're like wow so they when when receiving an obvious and very
fundamental relatable theme they go nuts
oh my that was very how a little more you do
atinborough narration oh yeah these creatures and now we see them in a frenzy
they even start to attack each other
uh the ants cannot see so despite the fact the theme is right in front of their faces
they cannot smell it so they desperately search and now you see the ground they attack one another
they turn violent they are now
they think the theme is a path
is
taking a shit on the theme like a like a poorly trained house cat and now we introduce
the last jedi into the habitat and they all calm down
despite all evidence to confirm they believe it to be the greatest film ever
it's despite it's being
oh and hug it
i don't know man like it's just fascinating and i'm really only pressing play at this point to
just see if there's anything else with commenting on with the video my my investment in this video
is by the moment it wanes yes oh wane
that was great
get that of apostrophes on rags yeah what
he's milking i wonder if there's a reason they're like the mushroom people
i can't remember why the mushrooms yeah i was thinking about that too
i love the why didn't you say anything did dave that well you said it already
attack each other too late they were waiting on me yeah because i think that i was gonna let didn't
want to poison the well rags and be like they shouldn't be mushrooms i want you to experience
it for yourself first because i don't even know if they should or shouldn't be mushrooms i like them
i like that they are funny as fuck maybe they're like parasitic mushrooms or something
i like a little
yeah
yeah the little noises they make are great yeah
uh plate plate's actually in chat right now he said uh artistic license
yeah it works really well the mushroom people
it also explains why they love shits
the poop cactus they're all really happy with it
it's despite it being a character
what made you say poop cactus i don't fucking know that is really specific but like that's how
bad tlj is it's a poop cactus that people hug it's uh it's a horrible horrible visual but you know
important that we we don't face away from reality it actually kind of reminds me of uh
there was this really there's this really like weird experiment back in the day by this guy
named uh harry harlow and he made uh i i forget what exactly it was trying to prove but he made
he took like baby monkeys and gave them two different mothers like a famous old psychology
experiment one was like a a metal sort of fake mother with milk and nutrition and the other was
just like a warm soft sort of fuzzy mother with no nutrition and most of the they found
that most of the baby monkeys would rather cling to the soft affectionate mother and die of starvation
than get the actual nutrition from the cold uncaring mother wow that's just what i thought
when i saw him embracing the shitty cactus i just wanted to i just wanted to give everyone
shitty cactuses these people's mother essentially like they feel a sense of like acceptance and
love from it yeah if you don't believe if you don't believe me there you go i believe it oh yeah
uh i like how in the background you see those two noticing the poop cactus with happiness
yeah even though they're blind they can see a poop cactus
jay long moon just had me and said okay what why
i don't know just because it was like a really pointless fucking diatribe i went on
they're like uh you got it yep well at least you didn't pitch an anime it's not bad
it's progress that's true i'm making progress all right next set of memes
that being said watch monster mm-hmm also there are copyrightism videos mean rags will knock him
out in a in a mini at some point the last thing we need is the stream getting floomed
but yeah this is the human intercourse memes there's probably a lot of them coming
catching up with the memes as well
get your brain sucked out by human intercourse
it's just causing the preview not loading things for you guys you gotta click the ones that don't
load god hmm weird something i can do i'm sorry unless i remake the call i think which
is uh let me take a look at these the blue goo bob
these are both pretty good oh no why is he mad what is i don't know
somebody drew that like you know for completely different reasons
good old shad have space for my bolognese what is uh what's the original thing for this
not sure
yes we shan't discover oh look it's supposed to be undertale right i am gluttony and rags is uh
loosed yeah boy it's complete sense
yeah that's pretty fitting actually i think this is referencing uh whether or not it was movie
blob about the nazi quote it's just a chat movie blob every time do you think at any point he's
never going to acknowledge movie blob or diabeto like has he responded to any of those things i
don't i don't know i don't think diabeto has been but he must have been called movie blob long
before we'd even start even why is quinton on a tank with uh it looks like a mexican sombrero
that's a fucking good ringtone homie who uh was that fringy just now fringled oh there's the
objection music from phoenix right what that is that is it's the longman it's made just for you
this is uh jake showing some regret there i'll happen to get is a one type of thing
you'll be back
oh my god look at this it's so sad space balls boring taxi driver isn't good
is it me or is efap getting crazier out there
everybody's got takes that mine's right
but literature an introduction to fiction poetry and drama uh from long man that is the
the mate yeah it's funny didn't one of my other followers tweet at you with like they found like
long man yeah i think there's a lot of books for it so people just keep discovering it all their
day to day i think this is when he said space balls is boring i just like to imagine jay has
this shit eating grin on his real life face like when he's tweeting anything so i can't take that
it's uh the cooperative uh hop off real quick i don't like yeah i gotta i gotta depart uh but
yeah thanks for having me on uh see everybody see you later see you later bring it love you
um link to his channels in the description if if he plans on making videos which i think
is happening eventually so uh but yes oh sudden ejection he's dead now
me next oh of course that's what that would appease chat
i was a long man to actually drive a rip-off efap because he said 12 hours of work and still
can't sleep get it get it it all makes sense very epic
something because uh when we read about the alternate script where luke was like
bugging kylo in episode oh yeah now i'm just a dick um
she got rebellion she's killed he's like she's gone man that's a fucking tragedy not she yeah
i guess like you'd think she could be repaired but they needed to take her pots and she was
irreparable i think it's for the best that she couldn't have been repaid so apparently
nancy pelosi's not a fan of efap well fuck her i know you know what's really funny about that
clip she got it she got it ready to rip and then the camera cut away and then it cut back
and then she started to and then she actually ripped it did you guys ever catch that no but
i guess she knew where the cameras were facing at the times i guess yeah yeah like she totally
grabbed it and did the thing where she was like twisting her wrists like she was about to rip it
and then as soon as the cameras cut away she's like well i gotta wait i gotta make sure everyone
sees it or fins were in plot armor true they didn't do anything with that i wonder what jj
was planning on doing with that that that injury we all kind of forget about it at this point
a lot of these good news we're gonna happen style of meme relieving you of your command
i hope you understand what you're doing should i check for weapons now i'll be fine
but like things like that like change the entire course of the movie
um so the mass cast has the mask is a keyhole
they i guess they had access to it and it was i i'm alfred it's the uh the big twist
i don't mind being an orb was the danny devito being iron man memes
i think he's well suited oh well suited
i like how they'd shrink him fucking down he's got that little face he's like it's me
he he oh hey the beep got upgraded if you have to decide on their vote
stressfully trying to figure it out but again chat just know this shit
like that's bob the gamer is a wily menace and must be rooted out in all forms these
jokers must be revealed from the hidden troves and brought to annihilation that's bob
bob that's a real quote isn't it i don't even know it could be the gamer not about gamers yeah
oh hey long bread
and they framed it
on long garlic bread did it more keep your hands off
agent rags i have a new mission for you take out the lost jedi defenders
yeah rags is one of the troopers straight from russia only job i like your laptops got a little
bone on it yay oh yeah that's good detail they get a little stupid that's really really good
danny tavito iron man again oh my god that was even better i like how he's drilling a little bit
you'll want to see it yeah i would love i would fucking watch that shit
several times absolutely my messivity is incomprehensible molar i can't just vote
twice but five times i said that's subjective that's the end of the movie is pretty amazing
oh yeah where do you go in there he didn't know that he didn't have the stones at the time
that's a pikachu drawing um i think they're both annoyed at something i don't know the context
enough it's pichu thanks this pre-evolution fucking idiot um no it's not it's actually a
completely it's an oc you fuck yeah no i i need citation for that thanks um i'll give it to you
on the back of a train when it plows through you this is um not my guy for making image of
everything you love being bombed by disney oh yeah he made that in vr didn't he pretty sure
that's like fucking the vr painting program that's really good though yeah that's really good
good this is dramatic zoom into mickey standing proudly this is uh kov kovarian kovarian kovarian
i don't even know but rendition of mr rags he's got like kovarian kovarian kovarian like that
no one for j that guy i like these backgrounds are simple but they're
they matter yeah effective uh no one for all mewbsley as well
yeah i remember seeing these on twitter they're really good i remember i saw the little the little
bone uh wrists and i was like uh yeah each office when they make me they they can change all kinds
of things i'm not sure what it means to be a skeleton underneath i also like that the
backgrounds are uh circles for rags diamonds for j and squares for you
oh it's just a nice little little selection awesome yeah
like this from uh less your blackbird as well so it's mupa
got a high-pitched squeaky voice poor very not very tall frequently confused for baller
feels it's more like the super villain version i guess look at the way that e is done because
it used to be an l like mooler mooler it's like an altered i guess i don't know it just looks funny
not trust mupa i think the reason why you're fucking avatar so successful is because it
perfectly matches your voice you seriously sound like just a like an evil space like i have a gas
mask no you don't sound like you have a gas mask on you don't sound like you have a gas mask on i
just mean it's it's just a very imposing it's imposing imagery and it matches with yeah it
matches with the affect of your voice the affect yeah the affect did i use that wrong
um i don't know i just stood excuse me spell that aff ect like just the sort of the mannerisms
in which you speak like the the delivery i think affect affect two different things
yeah yeah an affect i well i guess because yeah affect is a verb an affect is a noun
a dash sorry to affect something or something has an effect no that's legends now and it would be
effect oh yeah you gotta try to say yeah i think yeah i get it rags you're very smart and you
called me out on something i made a mistake on it was it was weird it was weird this is this is
rag's face right now i thought that was like an industry like term or something i heard it used
from a professional voice actor but he could have been wrong oh maybe maybe i don't know what i'm
talking about i'm just squishing this this is a good squishy rags it's very soft oh it's another
rendition of rags i don't know that boy seems upset why is rags so sad what oh no it's like
too realistic it's like oh no this is a tiny little why you can almost see a little neck fat
he's a very human it's almost like a it's like a you know how fluffy sheep necks are
yeah that's true do you want a sheep like in real life rags um i mean in a way but it's like
like i just don't i don't have the time and all about to devote to having a dog yeah but you know
i like the idea of having one absolutely it's i think they're like 2.5 to 3.3 k to buy one
yeah for me it's an effort time thing it's not really a money thing yeah actually might not be
an exotic pet just exotic scratch that i am an exotic pet oh you're critiquing me instead of
running away you're coming right to me i can't meme the shit out of you without getting closer
makes sense uh standard logic i kind of do want to see like a dedicated piece of fan art with uh
fucking quintin on dio's body i like this one horrible objective baddie
take a little weebl like uh it's like i'm a tiny little molar in a toilet roll
yeah is this was it like an early 2000s thing or like a 90s thing but they'd have the uh
like bean people like mighty beans or something is that what they were called
i remember just say mighty bean
oh my yeah that's correct i'm not i'm not a crazy person mighty beans
i remember these does anyone yeah i just remember the commercial i never got any
the retarded jt itself kids anything president place all normal milk with rhino milk
but black pantheon will be black pant panther when what is that black panther on
oh black panther on loop but he doesn't like that film anymore panther odd objectively kills
are kicking him will be banned we'll launch preemptive strike on the blue creeping slime
that is cinema blaberto that's like how his name keeps evolving too we'll use taxpayer dollars to
pay mundane matt to cut him to come on him oh my god to come on him well banned all women from
existing damn i mean vote for him if you want and i guess yeah where's the problem i don't know he
hasn't got a stance on minorities i would upset you right chase yeah yeah it really depends oh
boy oh here we go what's so funny cura made a video that totally put molar in his place
i heard the video was a complete misrepresentation of it when i was molar substance mean all the
time really do you have examples hell no see i knew new guy would be on our side new guys uh
he's one of us oh they got a joker thing and uh uh what is the other thing
persona right yeah persona five yep
that's i'm in jade scene feel like he hasn't joker probably not no you're going to see nothing
oh we got another new guy i mean i mean that character in persona is called joker so maybe
that was the white man thought his opinion mattered i thought as a society we grew beyond
judging others like this oh wow i could tell we're gonna be the kind of co-workers of good friends
really hell no also i'm breaking your hand and stealing your bike oh that breathers picture
oh this is so unlikable that font is actually that's a pretty good match font by the way
bread the cosmic chicken's brother fraud the not so cosmic chicken oh right i really wish
spore did better and was better maybe they'll get a remake someday never know that'd be cool
the baits are
that meme said staying power as well from community
that video was demonetized it's been remade it has been remade
oh this is actually one of the better ones i am all the metanarrative
i drank all the rhino milk i don't know who wins if if bob has all metanarratives and
jay has all the rhino milk like it's still kind of tough we'd have to see what happened
send me buddy's game quasim solomani has been copyright striking efap's doom video
finally it's been freed yeah the world's a better place hot take gas mass people in ewok lives don't
matter people need to stop beating around the bush and say it guess i'm the only one who sees
through ewok propaganda sad when it reviews is uh he knows his shit point
that sounds like a trump tweet almost just because i think it's supposed to be said sad
i don't want to make of uh this so what what it rags on barbie frick all right
decidedly an improvement wow getting on barbie frick i'm not sure what to make of this
i just don't i think i have issues with uh with quinton i think that's what this image is trying
to say it's very artistic there's lots of ways to interpret it
give a part three game of thrones episode six for age i'm distracted by rises
i think a lot of people are distracted by rises guy walker
oh yeah so here you go this is the uh you could probably save this if you want to i guess but
it's like the screenshot version of that um video oh my god

jay is just lost in a field somewhere i guess and he sees that the isle of man is coming for him
to kick him oh no i hope he makes it out the only time i've never seen him smiling thank god
this ball of rhino i gotta fuck jay now oh shit this changes everything
i don't know if jay's seen this or not by the way a person who made this i hope he has

tomatoes not bad the don delorean my god those faces in chat those are scary
and then this penis i think from strata maya uh oh that's a fun egg is a welsh word that's
really fun and the girding style is really cool what does it mean um it means like excellent or
fantastic essentially hmm ah at least that's what i remember it meaning i could be wrong
but that's like this drawing is teachers in in our schools would randomly if you do a good
way be like bendy get egg and we'd be like uh okay thanks i guess fucking useless nonsense
language am i right yeah yeah yeah also people in chat are saying jay zet oh because of like
bowset i guess yeah that is disturbing let's just harass him with jay zet memes disturbing
i don't think that's that's not a very nice thing to do in fact i call tisms on that um but yeah
uh i've got a one more selection of memes so i think uh we'll just do some question tisms before
jumping into them as well break it up a bit as you do questions yeah um and so yeah i suppose
i'll move on because you know we got some see which has to catch up with as well so we'll do
today's ones and we might actually be able to get to um oh my god there's a new youtube studio again
kidding me new and improved youtube studio is here that's a lie go to legacy classic or go back to
studio what the fuck legacy class why is why have you called it legacy classic gotta just be classic
leg wait legacy classic okay seems unnecessary like i get it they hate it and they want it to
die even though it functions really well but don't need to keep changing the fucking
i'm just cycling past oh there we go uh anyone else still bothered by cap send off an end game
he's always been my favorite but his decision almost felt like a betrayal to me yes yeah the
more time goes on the more i really don't like it don't like it the worst part is when you think
about uh what happens once he gets back there does he just hang out with her does he get a
job at the local grocery store what does he do look all i'm saying is that captain america let
9 11 happen assuming he did yeah because this is the only other thing is that is he in their
universe because that means he let a whole bunch of things happen i don't know man just doesn't
seem right does it don't seem it seems don't seem right don't seem right nope don't seem right
taxi driver got ronald reagan shot that's true

a fapper is never late noisy early he climaxes precisely when he means to time it just right
hello all monikers so glad to have you doing
guys doing epaps on saturday i work alone on saturday and you guys objectively help me get
through the day so thank you that's great you're welcome yeah i see a lot of people saying that
and that's it's really nice i think it works for work yeah this this sort of thing oh yeah i
remember there was someone who was like i fucking worked the night trip to the hotel and like this
12-hour stream has been the fucking best night of my life and i was like oh yeah i've done some
night shifts at hotels there ain't nothing going on yeah um the french language is like having sex
with oprah except oprah is homeless and instead of oprah it's simply a dumb fat wim what wam woman
it fucking cough what the french language is like having sex with oprah but she's
fat dub okay that's strange one but all right wait oprah except fat and dumb and homeless oh okay
uh me why didn't mando just snipe the client in episode seven through a window
friend well someone that important isn't going to be in a vulnerable spot like that
me how did he die again friend he got shot through the window fuck client in episode seven
isn't that the one before the finale
oh do you mean oh so uh winner hurtsog they're saying why didn't mando shoot him like through
the window because he has like the scannytisms as well right and then i guess the friend said
he's not going to be killed like that and then he literally dies like that uh yeah next episode
although climax of the first one yeah that's interesting i don't think about it uh moodles
quickly does this make you like westworld more man in black's goal is explicitly stated as
wanting to free the hosts maze was just his means not his goal through his actions with
mave and delores and maze this happens in the final scene he is super happy um uh like i said
well the whole reason i said i didn't want to approach any criticisms for um westworld as i
haven't seen it since it first day of season one so um uh i think i watched it again after that to
set up my um my criticisms but then i got distracted with tlj and the rest is history
so um yeah uh i'm gonna try and distance myself from westworld criticisms unless i decide to go
back to it so you may be right i'd have to look into it uh listening to the endgame efab asking
about best time travel stories primers definitely up there but netflix the netflix's show dark may
be the greatest the writing is objectively incredible also 12 monkey show is great and
has one of buffy's directors david grossman all right i've not heard of dark um i do need it
it's a good bibbity bopity the jews are undermining our democracy all right then
it might take on time travel because it is sci-fi we don't know how it actually works
so you can make up your own rules for it i'm uh the important part is you stick to the rules
primer and dark have different rules but both consistently follow them what do you think
yeah like yeah i would say that just like just you know be careful like don't don't do something
like i'm trying to think of like don't push it too far i guess yeah like it's got to be
there's still like within some form of reason i suppose and you've got to be careful with time
travel because you also need to account for like teleporting as well um being that the earth moves
if you really want to get pedantic with stuff like that it's like i'm gonna be on this spot
but 10 years ago and then you're just in space you're like ah die like all those people who
came back after the uh yeah infinity is awkward we try not to think about those things
uh i've been waiting for 30 minutes lock both the war ragons yes we were a little bit late today we
got uh we got delayed and a certain guest did not uh appear a lot of people were like which was the
guest who was this like why would i tell you who it was just so you can yeah be like oh you're a
badman it's like it's fine you'll you'll be able to meet them one day or you've already met them
or you've already met them sonic the hedgehog and unbridled praise when um
i think unbridled praise i think southpaw's making a video that's uh
in favor of it i haven't seen it yet so but it's all right i have heard it's all right as well
uh efap quote without context of the day i'm fucking dating my dad apparently you said that
ranks me yeah oh one of those quotes we're just like i don't i don't know about that no
clue i didn't i don't remember it but if i did then well there it's been said um what would you
say to the people who use ghost ob1 sitting on the log in episode six as a defense for Luke being
able to hold the saber and lift the x-wing we've already covered that um yeah it's quinton made
that argument in his tlj video and it's fucking ridiculous if you want to go that far then ghosts
shouldn't be able to stand on the floor should they like there's like a hover well this is the
thing right we we logically assume it's like well it's not that they're standing on the floor it's
that they are where they want to be and so obviously you could fake sitting on a log as
a ghost it's not like you need to do anything if you don't weigh anything you know i think that's
just an editing thing with the special effects what do you mean where he brushes against the log
or i'm not even talking about brushing anything just literally sitting on it
oh sitting on it's fine it's it's the thing that um quinton had said about the how his like um
his robe makes the grass sway a little bit i mean if that's a mistake obviously well the
kind of thing that's really fucking hard to avoid he's a fucking ghost
and like if you want to go this far and be like there we go we conclude that um he the ghosts can
affect the world i'm just like great you know what happens now that we've assessed that
not good bad happens as a result of that everything gets fucking screwed up
um every guest fell through rip also howdy everybody not every guest it was
not every guest i'm here just the one dude um old wamen you know jeez also i'm still here
i apologize for being silent i'm uh just doing something right now filling out paperwork for
something that's okay i'm not i'm not that i'm here um howdy rags hello you know where the
bubvins is i don't know where the bubbles is you guys are not fair about third-party star
world comic material we literally read textbooks in schools now to learn things we didn't know
pretend to agree to get reaction out of rags oh that was in brackets um yeah but rags those
that i don't agree with that so we'd be stuck we'd be screwed but uh no i agree we should be sent
into cinemas with little booklets that have little guides to each of the events of the film
so it's like turn page 27 at the hour mark and we will tell you what the items all the characters
are holding and what they do and the film even pauses and the lights come on they're like
everybody read the page come on sans is in smash kick j higher rags
hi poop with the door open you masses are still going no man eats toothpaste all the obligatory
memes why thank you an efficient super chat uh what is a star wars movie and show each of you
would make if given relatively high budget and total creative control by rags hello um
um how am i making the mandalorian one just remaking it yeah just good i would change a
shit ton but uh that would be a really cool bit of freedom you know or run with that star wars
horror movie i'd want to make because it seems like it'd be easy it seems easy like it would be
like all you had to do is just not break your own rules and have a consistent character like it
i mean i say it's not hard but then again we've done this enough and we've assessed
enough to where we're like yeah this shouldn't be a problem well there you go um bring metal chases
gay and likes anime um this is gay metal is asleep and chase is gay yeah i'm afraid metal is also gay
possibility but uh but a worthy one never hit an efap this early before rags you're a potato
i'm no i'm not a potato i am high fruit animal crossing face man you're a turkey
wow i think that's chase yeah maula you're a sentient respirator i'm okay with that i'm
wait wait i'm a sentient respirator
why would you be a sentient respirator because i do and i'm sentient
wait you are because you do yeah i respirate all the time i've got it
oh i mean if you can prove that in a court of law i will allow you to have that as a as a thing
um just finish the super check catch up stream and efap goes live immediately after good timing
also jojo is for basic bitches and mainstream weebs bam oh my god and chase is silent so i think
he agrees like he would obviously he would obviously create a counter argument if he didn't
agree he's a quiet respirator watch vinland saga you welshtism it's super great i've i've heard
that before i think super chats have said that before um also hi rags hello and chase i don't
like minorities face that's me harry potter and the prisoner didn't kill himself
that's funny that's pretty good donut operator as a guest i i'm aware of him yeah if uh if if he
ever shows interest for sure and as far as i know he has not yet but uh we could sort that out
sometime yeah uh will the act man ever return to efap i don't see why not he was a good guest
i have to figure something out and get a good topic going and maybe if he um
maybe if we can get a tonaled video for him to check out you know it could be interesting
also try and bring on mysterious mr enter he makes good reviews of animated shows
fair enough we're always interested in new guests like today
ah i'm tricking them see i'm making them think it was a new guest aha but we've all
been here at least one time before hmm hello my long words here's some love from france for you
oh wonderful no french person thank you for the laughs and the objectively great content stay
long mauler buy rags and give shad his spaghetti bolognese and keep jay near deprive a man with
swords of spaghetti bolognese no none of us are brave enough for that um hey rags hey me again
pooping with the door open freedom never felt so good freedom is the ability to exercise my right
to keep that door closed it's true uh nirvana blows i can't say free hong kong oh because
the implication is that the super chat is getting cut off the moment that's spoken
really also well i mean joke but nirvana blows i'm surprised
really it's a hot take yeah anyone's seen nick cage's color out of space i have not
no i don't know what it might be chase opinion on ishi zuko reviewers
ishi zuko reviewers uh what's ishi zuko anime is that something i've known about or is that a
proper noun rags whatever's the word you don't recognize is probably the name of an anime i
haven't fucking no idea what that is honestly i like anime but i don't fucking know like everything
about don't lie sorry i'm a fucking failure oh man final effap before and tango school ranger
school i mean anger school does tango school sound like anything to you it could be tango
like he's learning to tango and there's a school for that it's it's t-a-n-g-e-r so i assume that's
a lot of mistakes to become tango but maybe i thought maybe ranger school could be it but
i don't know anyway it says i'm gonna be so far behind best of luck and have fun y'all
thank you have fun in tango school uh mola could you please say oh this is uh this is we watched
this like yesterday it's the it says don't talk about me you son of a bitch it's me mola the long
man but that's that's the same line that link kara says in the um in the in the psychic pebbles
impersonating trump animation yeah like don't you talk about me you son of a bitch
oh the great link kara the great link kara
get him out of here don't give him his coat so i guess i've got to say it um don't you talk
about me you son of a bitch it's me mola the long man but don't actually abbreviate son of a bitch
yeah uh nailed it there you go mutually bringer why is your like bring it so embarrassing uh why is
your nose a lock where's the key and what does it open those the secrets of the universe i'm afraid
well noses are normally holes anyway his is just a different kind yeah also hello all my e-words
how are everyone's pets and or slave laborers yeah mine are good oh they're doing all right
yeah all are pretty healthy yeah gotta keep them healthy oh they did correct it to ranger school a
little bit later there you go have you seen the original 2d clomors micro series i think
it's better than the clomors cartoon better continuity and badass general goodness i have
some of it i remember seeing ads for it back in the day yeah take a look see rags do you honestly
think cinnamero verto can reach down there to crank it oh my god ah probably not he's got to
get around the gut maybe put it on a shelf or something hope you can get gokinaru on sometime
that was oh my god gokinaru was planned all the way back at the end of 2018 that was the first
time i think i'd asked him to come on pretty sure it was so it means it's been a year and a couple
of months now did he say no no he said yes but we could never figure out a time so i'll try and
i'll try and get that sorted because we have so many people that i'm supposed to get on and it's
just they slip through the the proverbial cracks if you will let's say yeah we'll try and sort that
out the one i plan to do with him was we watch van Helsing and then look at nostalgia critics
video on it that was a thing one day one day in which efap did you efaps discover the jeb bush meme
that's the jenny nicolson one uh with wolf with jebby nicolson heavy nickels this whole thing but
yeah it's uh we actually would have found that out as well because of the top 10 meme videos
rags who's the hottest elise ride lee's reed i don't know elissa white gluzz or simone simmons
all right let's say what are the names again i will paste them to you
for this person it goes elise is the best then elissa then simone
google imaging intensifies simone sim and simons uh elise then elissa then simone
yeah the same as this guy all right let's build a look with the sun that's the uh
the highlights maker don't worry chase my mom is already dead oh you read that out yeah yeah
i read that one also bless you multiple times right i'm not christ but i still said it so are
you prepared for the arrival of corona chan oh rags has already got it so too late yeah it's
been a rough few days um but yes i'm sure we'll be fine just stock up on soup cans everybody all
right fine mola look at ark pulse generator on wikipedia it's a possible explanation for
how the empire killed the mandos in episode seven i'm not gonna read it on wikipedia why
it makes sense that the entire bad delorean sect got destroyed at the end of that episode is
too much to make no sense too much to them uh with a new admiral admiral animal crossing game
coming out i have to ask if you were represented as a villager in a game what animal would you
want it to be yeah this will be tougher for some of us than others i feel like a panther could work
a long panther a black panther um chase you're the only one left because i think rags's answer
would be relatively straightforward sorry what was the question again i was distracted by a meme
you're an animal crossing what animal would you be oh god uh i feel like i kind of want to be a
porcupine just i really like their design in that game because you're a big freaking prick hey yes
after working a 60-hour work week i get to see my first live efap excellent also hi rags hello and
hi mola hello uh watched your amnesia versus soma series left a comment on the last part looking
forward to frictional's next game like they kind of already started in our arg stuff for it so they
take as long as you need frictional i'll be there yes i think you'll cover it or other horror non
horror games in the future if so i vote terminator resistance i've heard a lot of people praising
terminator resistance i kind of want to play it just for that now like to find out what the hubbub
is above yeah i'm kind of curious as for if i'd covered frictional's new game it'll literally
just be dependent on how it makes me feel like if i play it and adore it or desperately want to
make a video on it that's kind of what happened with the amnesia and soma stuff kind of what
happens with anything i cover is just uh gotta get that passion that fire burning
it'll happen potentially is rags a dog or a walrus i'm definitely a dog i'm gonna go with
dog yeah yeah also hi rags hello um so this quote comes from big old fun baggins uh 69 bc
how was rags or how rags all right all right a little a little under the weather but it's
nothing serious hi chase hello hi rags
hi basically you gotta leave them hanging hello my fellow massives mauler what are your best
tips for a soulsborne noob like myself also hi rags don't get hit and kill all the enemies
that's yeah it's pretty solid um the thing about advice for dark souls games is that i
me and my communities when we were playing them like streaming and stuff we we love the idea of
you have no tips no help know anything you just jump in and you do your best it's only until you
basically give up the tips would be provided but just you know stay alert experiment a lot figure
out what's working what's not have a look at all those stats and descriptions and figure out your
armors and your weapons and get immersed i always felt that dark souls is one of the best things for
that in terms of just rewarding you for sort of going hey what's this what's this do oh this does
that oh wow sort of thing it's uh it's good shit sort of thing uh hi mauler just caught up in all
the videos since christmas thanks to a moderately dilapid debilitating illness sorry i'm okay now
excellent your catch-up vids always remind me of ringo star in the simpsons episode
oh where he's he's reading fan mail and he's got like a room filled with letters i believe
and he says that he will get through all of them we will i want to say he got the most fan mail
out of all of them um is rags a dog or a sea lion asking for a friend i'm a dog definitely go with
dog yeah i'm a dog sea lions are like water doggos though sargon showed movie bob's eugenics
comment in his video about richard dorkin's recent comments richard dorkin said abort down
syndromes babies to prevent suffering i mean that's a take obviously i mean i i'm not gonna
believe that's the i'm gonna have to see a quote of that um yeah yeah i'm assuming there's way more
context to a statement like that um that he would want to get out there i don't know but
he upset a lot of people talking about eugenics even though he was right from from what i had
read all he said was it it functions in that you it does what you wanted to do like you want to
focus on certain genes and not other ones eugenics can't do that that's what the process is yeah
whether it's ethical or moral etc is is yeah there's a totally other that's the whole reason
why it's not engaged with because whether or not it works isn't really up for question which i
thought was his whole point but he pissed i think the implication is that he talks about
it working encourages the idea that we should maybe think about it and he like everyone's
upset at him for that uh hey rags hi what would you do if you came home to your clone pooping
with the door open it would only go to prove my point that my clone and i wouldn't be the same
person would you would you ask murder him at that point no how'd that be murder he'd have to he'd
have to mess up way worse than that even if it was legal to murder or that he didn't have human
rights so you could just murder him and get away with it no i still wouldn't do it oh i just thought
you believed in that to that degree i guess i was wrong uh i have a couple of question how often if
ever do you guys actually skip a super chat and why i don't skip any yeah i don't think there's
any that i see that don't get read out if ever i don't read one it's because i missed it or because
it got deleted by youtube when it came to me i'll even like you know there's some that i've read
that i'll be like oh i could get in trouble for that one but the best the worst i'll ever do
is read them out in such a way that they don't get said what they were looking to get said because
it was too controversial there's these things that can happen like that but even still i will
try and read those out um and how did you guys actually feel about wolf leaving i'm i'm pretty
at peace with it because i think it's what he wanted and yeah that's what's important
but still you know in contact and he's he's he's doing okay he's doing right so i think that
if this was you know if youtube and social media life was that much of a burden slash uh
trouble for him like i think it's good that he's gone away from it
uh because man can it be a nightmare for a lot of people
rags you don't really have the corona virus do you no no i just have a little cold
that's what they all say before corona comes hi rag hi hi mauler hello hi whatever guest is still
there fuck you oh hi there oh wow um could you do your favorite favorite wesker quote but with a
french accent is it 20 minutes is all he has to play with you is that the quote uh seven seven
seven minutes is all i have to play with you crease seven minutes is
because you have to get the sort of you have to incorporate this sort of voice
but you also have to do it in a little bit of it you have to do it you have to do it
my my feast will rise like this
my my brain always crosses uh the line liquid and milk or someone where he's like snake how did you
like my sunglasses and i always imagine wesker saying that to chris at the very end of re5
it just seems fitting yeah chris i would you like to go back to my place for some overtime
it happened over time if you enjoyed the xxx song for the my family pies then look at the
sitcom show the song for big bang is especially good rat
oh that was the the porn song i remember yeah the incest porn thing yeah fair enough uh high rags
hello hi rags get well soon oh thanks yeah maybe another day it's already better than it was
yesterday live from the live from us would be like le fromage craze
fun fact that is actually uh not true french you would say all fromage lies it's not gonna do
this for two frenches i also hate french people yeah also if archie t2 could reinstall c3po's
memory in ros does that mean he lets c3po die at the end of revenge with the sith yeah that was
something i said in my video was that it has implications for the end of the third episode now
but archie t2 can just back him up but he just chose not to i guess at that point he's like oh
well was that a falling out yeah we had a quote recently and was wondering your thoughts on it
art should comfort the disturbed and should disturb the comfortable do you agree
no there's no art should when it comes to making people feel i don't agree yeah i don't agree with
the idea that art should fulfill a particular purpose for certain people like yeah anybody
can get anything out of it what if the disturbed need to be disturbed in order to be undisturbed
hmm bet you never thought of that kick free high rags oh yeah we kicked him
not bad big guiles or big gales i don't know what to make of that release the jj cut of
the ewok adventure movies yeah i mean if we can you know we'll raise awareness
we'll get it done ewok adventure movies deserve to be seen joker still has a higher box office
than tros excellent proof that people vote with their wallets sometime
um hey drunk me five hours from now this is you at work remember to pick up milk
yeah alex lee you pick up that milk
oi maulie thoughts on ludwig and lauren's fights um i love ludwig's last phase i don't like his
first phase i find it annoying especially the charge lauren's is um i remember it being annoying
because he's a bit of a pastor boss and i affectionately name basically the ones where you
get close to them and then it fills the screen with hair and shit and then the fps goes down
and it's just a nightmare not a huge fan of either of them but um if ludwig was the second
phase for the whole thing i'd probably like him a lot uh i have controversial blood-borne opinions
i'm sorry uh long man i need you to say a good strong flick off joseph it's very important
do you think they wanted me to say fuck off over and there to put flick for the super chat or what
perker i have to say flick off you want me to say flick off that sounds fake
like maybe i should do both like fuck off joseph and flick off joseph
i'm sure you can work with that uh if you needed flick off that sounds unlikely but okay
bow down to the chinaman never hello all of my hp lovecraft cats weirds
i i get it the cat's name uh look up masquerade the baubles of doom
masquerade the baubles of doom this so like a game the baubles of doom
i guess let me have a look in uh
uh good old youtube search gameplay and ultra setting
um i don't know what i'm supposed to make of this looks interesting i guess
oh there's no comments unfortunate
released relatively recently half a year ago ish
like a platformer third person i think i don't know what to what why yes i approve i guess i
don't know um molar have you seen season two of one punch man no i still haven't and that's
i'm a bad man for not having done that i feel bad
uh repay replay value did an in defense of the euphemia euphemia scene oh from code gies well
um yeah that's not a defensible scene the best you can do is try and be like hey it could have
been worse so sorry it's it's very clunky dialogue the kind that um fringy was talking
about earlier saying that anime often gets away with the it's a disappointing moment but hey
they could have like maybe if they remake it or something they can fix that just just just
just up update the streamable versions with a better version of that scene it'll be fine
it was previously thought that the black hole ton ton 618 was the densest and most massive
object in the universe but scientists recently have found one even greater xxy mobius blobbyus
i get it mobius blobbyus uh chase thoughts on gait and how it's a crime there is no season three
uh gait's a bad anime watch better anime oh this person seems to like it chase you can't do this
uh gait's a bad anime oh is that the one with fucking roary mercury the fucking cat girl that's
got the fucking scythe or whatever it's just it's really mediocre it's an okay anime but it's
literally just about like oh boy i love video games and japanimation and i fucking oh shit
we got transported into this alternate universe where like the military is in like a fantasy
universe and it's just like i don't know it's just it's whatever sorry chase it's just a wet
dream for everyone with escapist fantasies oh wow a lot of people in chas is an anime
it's not it's not great it's just some seasonal fucking trash is it like a couple years old now
what makes you think i know anything about i'm asking chat you fucking piece of shit you have
to address that you can't just ask the question willy nilly well they're they're listening more
than you are anyway that doesn't make sense because i reply to you you idiot oh hey everyone
in chat seriously convince maul to watch death note it's fucking great rags too rags would like
that show like there's it's not a perfect show but it's about you rags and me like watch it and
then we come out thinking it's dreadful and so we just we avoid talking about it we're like yeah
we haven't seen it no also gate could be a good anime i i you know i'm not trying to say it's
definitively bad but from what i saw of it it looked just like mediocre shit jesus is cancer
correct what do you say do you see or what is that it's it's just a fucking really popular
anime if this is what i'm thinking of isekai uh yeah yeah isekai it's it's just a really it's
like a goofy fucking slice of life like you're in an mmo dime a dozen anime i haven't seen a lot of
it but i got bored i think like seven episodes the fact that they have a name for that genre
specifically probably tells you everything you know about anime oh that's right it is it is just
i was thinking of the the one that like started it with the fucking the guy with the green cape and
aqua the the blue haired anime girl i don't watch bad anime okay i'm fucking people expect me to
watch all the popular well then how do you know that gate's bad uh because i watched a handful
of it and i saw a lot of other reviews by people that were basically just saying that's really
nothing special it uh didn't interest me long enough if i have a strong opinion on an anime
i'll make a video but it's good or bad what's the worst anime yeah the worst anime uh what is
the worst anime well okay do you mean like like it's just objectively bad like just can you be
more specific can you just answer the goddamn question yeah i'm trying to listen i'm stalling
okay i'm trying to think you don't have to stall you'd be like i don't know i have to think about
it i do have to think about it but you're kind of putting the pressure on a little bit regs well i'm
answer i'm asking the questions vector rags don't take no fools i will ask i ask the question
i want to say Naruto Boruto things in that vein no you know what i want to say if i really want
to give my shitty hot take my hero academia is one of the fucking worst anime i've ever seen
it's got like really charming characters and the art is really nice but it's just it's the most
fucking shonen show of all time it's just it's written in a way shonen means boy so it's like
it's a sort of uh classification of so there's like seinen which is for like teens it can be
edgier a little darker like uh death note is a seinen and then shonen is made for like much
younger audiences which usually means one it's gonna go on forever yeah it's gonna go on forever
no one's ever really gonna die there's never really gonna be much of a risk at all because
it's like oh we can't expose the kids to death so it's like fucking my hero academia just it has
a lot of like oh no this really bad thing could happen and then nothing bad ever happens the
heroes always save the day 100 of the time i also stopped watching just after the tournament arc
we're fucking icy hot one uh so i'm probably um speaking out of ignorance to some degree but
i don't know i don't know just the fans are cancer too what do you call like the adult stuff
that isn't hint height like adult level uh i don't i don't know off the top of my head there's not
to my knowledge there's not a ton and again i could be totally wrong anyone in chat if i'm wrong
uh make a video response yeah make a video response call me a fucking uh hack rod i'm fine
with that i like criticism yeah brack hoard but you know like shonen is just like you know
fucking one piece my hero academia naruto uh i'm trying to think of other ones trigun is a really
good show that's an old one but it's just about this fucking blonde dude with a big red coat and
cool sunglasses and i think he used to be like a super murderous killer man so everyone just
knows him as this like terrible horrible a criminal and then i don't really know exactly
the background but then when the trigun anime starts up he's just like oh i'm a good guy now
and the whole show is everyone just being like holy shit it's fucking fashion stampede he's like
no i'm a good guy now it's just got really great music it's kind of like cowboy bebop in that vein
where it's just really satisfying to watch it's just a good time overall also for anyone who
hasn't seen ghost stories have you have you heard of ghost stories mauler it's like a really
politically incorrect the enemy i know of ghost stories in general there's an anime called ghost
stories that's sold so fucking poorly in japan because it's just super milk toast in every
capacity it's just uh your usual like oh shit scary ghost paranormal stuff but it's really
really plain so then they needed to make it sell so when they gave it to the dummy company they said
just fucking do whatever you want just make this thing so a lot of people seem like a bad weave dude
yeah that's whatever weaves are like the worst judges you'll put
fucking with your anime i need to find a new anime expert
but if if fucking er would talk you wouldn't even need me
really i'm very easy to replace well but yeah so ghost stories there's like
jew jokes black jokes gay jokes i think they actually say the the fag word at some point
although i'm probably mistaken oh yeah the ghost stories dub is hilarious i would really good
everybody uh watch it it's hilarious very edgy not because you're a rabbit but because you're
black like just a lot of really fucking great one-liners they start joking that the youngest
child in their group is literally retarded uh and um like they they have a character with big lips
so they made him a jew they have a girl who's sort of like very in touch with the spiritual
world so they write her as like a devout fucking catholic who constantly tries to tell everyone
about jesus and that black people aren't like pure so it's it's really it doesn't fucking pull any
punches it's a good time um i just watched terminated ff i think they mean df uh and it's
worse than tlj and riser skywalker if someone likes tlj i'm okay with them but if they say
df is good i've got problems yeah it's pretty bad wow this one says four more years fuck bernie
all right then yeah trump on efap to flex on quinton wouldn't it be so awesome if we got trump
on efap and not a single political thing was mentioned it was all about star wars you know
one of the things that i do to keep myself uh to say it is i watch movies at the oval office
oh my god what was your favorite movie 2019 he's like peristag was very strong very strong very
strong showing boy v ferrari who's probably my favorite more v ferrari i like the the spirit of
americanism they did great things those people did great things from great country it's carnival in
brazil i'm drunk in the rain dancing to samba uh what a bad time to have an efap take this as my
token of my appreciation she is thank you very much enjoy carnival in the rain which is also
apparently someone in someone in chat said sign in is what you're looking for for non hentai adult
anime s-a-i-m-e-n all right i don't know if i've ever watched anything yeah how come you didn't
know that yeah i've never actually heard it said before this kind of exposes your credibility
doesn't it i used to be like way more into anime than i got old oh oh yeah yeah you've really
backed off yeah joker is greater than taxi shitter oh i agree it is it's legitly better better written
and edited since your doom watch together i've watched wanted to see you guys react to the live
action halo forward unto dawn film and if both release doom or halo
uh and if both release doom or halo i'm not sure what that means
and the live action halo forward unto dawn is that like a bad thing i don't know i don't know
if it's so good or bad i i actually have no idea hmm no zero zero days and 000 days until
since fucking hell english 000 days since chase recommended an anime
it shall remain that way boy chase heard kojima won you with death stranding oh yeah it's really
good great game is it he doesn't think that flying is it great i'm just trying to avoid
going off on another fucking ten what happened to your a million year long video about it hmm
uh i'm waiting until it comes down on pc and then i can look for it in better quality and i'll
buy the game again x there will be so mean to me x excuses movie blob is a special specimen i agree
hi rags hello the totally not communist candidate is projected to win over 50 in
nevada dem caucasus at the time of this super chat happy saturday happy saturday glib and metal are
in chat let him on god mel's popular apparently several people asked him to come on there you go
mel mel have a chance with this john wick video there'll be at least five people who want to see
it that's great gonna gonna try and push for an extra even six pull that off coming to theatres
near you within a month's time i think he's his aim um for the weeks everywhere mauler would you
efap the he she how tro s should have ended um i've seen it the the problem with that video
and this is really unfair but it's just true uh like 60 plus of the jokes they make are jokes
we've made i'm not saying they stole it from us or anything i'm saying that everybody's made these
jokes so just all of the like well fucking blah blah blah should have just blah blah blah like
they just do visual representations of that and it's like yep yep should have done it we agree
with those yep um i mean it's good little bit of catharsis i'd recommend everyone check it out if
you want to but there's not much we could do with it in terms of reacting we would just be like yes
this is correct um disney omitted the backstory that explains why bow peep is the way she is in
toy story four so they could sell it as dlc on their exclusive streaming service is that true
you fucking me that's from south pole i don't know if you can get joker if that's true
that sounds like something disney would do kind of does and very disappointing but you know
you're gonna do um i'd totally buy the whole efap figurine set and display them right next to my
mlp stuff oh no no you want to if you want to say that efap and mlp share universe i'm okay with this
we'll get over it maybe they make videos we can review you know the characters in the mlp universe
fits the power of friendship category hi last efap i sent the drill sergeant kurgen chat just
so you know stomping you guys was with every penny takes a slow smug sip of cognac um all right
there at least rags i'm alcatism fuck you all right bye mauler fuck you fair enough and then
hi i'm gayo hello gayo and then ha maul is a gayo uh react to all of that i need help
uh it's just one of those things you know you read that and you're like
mm-hmm okay i finally caught up after being behind for almost a year i didn't think i'd
ever catch up i don't even know what to do with my life now or self now let's celebrate with some
back-to-back super chats hi rags hello if you like sword of mana you should try out the rest
of the series secret of mana and syken densetsu three syken densetsu three is a really good game
all right well maybe one of these days i will get around to that because i really did like
sword of mana a whole bunch on the kingboy advance that yeah it's it's basically just that but a lot
better with much more options and like fucking uh character classes have like branching routes and
you can play with like it's like you can play with three other people if you have like the
multitap but it's it's a good game really got overlooked back in the day because i never uh
loved japan but it's a fantastic best game in the series
hey guys how do you objectively rate a game that has good gameplay but bad story or vice versa
that's tough depends on you can you repeat that for me the game has good gameplay and bad story
how do you rate it overall i'd say i mean i'd say gameplay is more important than story yes monster
hunter world for example fucking abysmal story but we're probably the worst story in any monster
hunter that attempts to have a story but the gameplay is so fucking good that you really
don't care and the story barely gets in the way so i guess it really is a question of how much
do they sort of hamfist the story into the experience if it's pretty in the background
or easily skippable cutscenes it's dependent on how bad these this gameplay is like if there's
an incredible amazing story it's like how bad are these mechanics if they're like the worst thing
ever then i suppose a story can't save it despite the reverse being possible which is the mechanics
there's a game called shut the fuck up the game is so good mechanically that it like outplays the
even the worst story in the world could be saved by great graphics but i don't think the best
story in the world can save the worst graphics i mean gameplay fuck so yeah that's an interesting
thought though i hadn't thought of that now chase go ahead you fuck sorry my whole family is just
people interrupting each other as soon as we were we want to talk because none of us ever stop
talking so that's just how i was raised but uh dragon guard is is a good example of a game that
has just really fucking mediocre gameplay but a pretty impressive story and i believe i'm no
expert but i believe dragon guard was kind of uh it set the precedent for the rest of the story of
in the near universe and like automata and everything um there's like one ending i think
that's canon but it's it's just really interesting like it's basically just your usual fucking musou
game where you're running around just cutting down swaths of large groups of enemies like musou
meaning like dynasty warriors and everything but like it's a very deeply tragic um and well-written
story i think it is anyway it's been a while so i it could have um aged worse than i thought but
there's like a character in that show who's like uh he's like a self-loathing pedophile
and he just he knows that he's a piece of shit so he like i think then he goes on to like a
pilgrimage to try to fucking like do good with his life and it's it's nothing like groundbreaking
but it's just kind of like oh shit that's that's new like i've never seen that done before
and there's uh there's a lot of other details about it but i'll i'll spare you
that's what immediately came to mind though yeah it's uh that's the best we could probably do for
a quick answer but yeah very long and interesting uh discussion topic brags and fringing are insane
breath of the wild looks amazing screenshots of that game look like a painting you would hang on
your wall how does it not look good uh it looks okay but it it's it's yeah from what i've seen it's
just the style is getting it uh more points than it probably would have if it was yeah
and it's it's a zelda game so like people are gonna fucking get really emotional over it even
if it is just kind of mediocre looking i think it looks pretty good it didn't blow my mind or
anything but it was fitting but people get very attached uh by the way i actually discovered rags
wolf and mauler separately and then found efap without knowing they knew each other that's
interesting cool uh the only reason i started watching efap is because rags stopped making
videos and i was searching for more rags videos they don't stopped he still had sorry just a
little or hiatus i'm sorry yeah yeah that's kind of funny though to be like what's rags doing oh
efap oh uh tell jay that he isn't allowed to say another word about kotor until he makes a video
about it and it better be mathematically levels of detail i mean i can i can save that one for jay i
suppose we'll tell him all about back to thoughts on sheep wars they happened what sheep wars sheep
wars they happened the sheep wars or the sheep and cattle wars were a series of armed conflicts
in the western united states which were fought between sheep men and cattle men over grazing
rights sheep wars occurred in many western states though they were not most common though they were
most common in texas arizona and the border region of wyoming and colorado generally the
cattle men saw the shepherds as invaders who destroyed their public grazing lands which they
had to share on a first come first serve basis between 1870 and 1920 approximately 120 engagements
occurred in eight different states or territories at least 54 men were killed and some 50 000 to
over 100 000 sheep were slaughtered oh my yeah that's uh wow human history huh you never know
what they get up to also high regs hello i did not hit her it's bullshit i did not hit her
i did not oh hi rags hello mola say a rags legusta le morzila de morino latino
love how the youtube bot barely knows spanish black in spanish is sensor what the fuck
oh negro is so sorry for the best dark souls experience controller or mouse and keyboard
controller say that one more time best experience with the dark souls controller or mouse and
keyboard i would easily say controller yeah i've never heard you can do it with a mouse and keyboard
it's just it's if you've played action games with a controller all your life then it just
it only fits but i've seen people play with them as a keyboard it looks like it controls just fine
if you can get used to the uh well it's the same for all controllers controller types looks okay
if you get used to it i had a guy who was like the best out of all of us on metroid hunters i think
it was and uh the ds one yeah he was like amazing at it and the fucking controls on that are like
one hand is on the touch screen the other hand is on the buttons and uh i mean it's it's awkward
to say the least um and he like you know you can learn anything you could you could have i think
we said this on neif have like a million years ago if you had like a sock and a crank that's your
controls you know there's someone out there who can be a legend with those i just i particularly
feel like you can't like platforms i could never play platformers i could never play with a mouse
and keyboard really just a keyboard i guess but that's never been something that's ever felt
comfortable to me in all my days of emulating old like super nintendo games that's because
you don't try hard enough yeah you're not a try hard yeah probably have you seen hello
gritos video where tros made him appreciate tlj even more also high ranks i'm looking forward
to you guys sorry i'm looking forward to you guys some of these over chats because people are just
fucking bashing this shit out of me i mean you know like really upset over like a passing comment
i'm making off the top of my head should have thought of that before you were wrong i should
have written a fucking essay in anticipation of how much i was going to anger the hardcores
i never claimed to be like a hardcore anime fan i just there's some i feel very passionate about
but it's gonna be fun um yeah so for that question uh we've i i the video is hilarious
like in terms of concepts and i think it's in the backlog it's a potential for us to cover
perhaps one day yes at rags twilex little twilex or oryans from star trek let's see
yeah
i am curious too
uh oryans well there you go um i think rag's confused because he doesn't have fingers
all right well it's the way it was described was just odd like i think i know i think i know what
he means it was just very strange and i have thumbs when i need to yeah it's the disney rule
uh hey rags henshina go go baby i love beautiful joe uh i've never actually played it but i fucking
i've seen people play it looks like a good time yeah that style's really fun are you guys gonna
react to eric butts's review of tros it's a riot is the one where he's just in the car with his
girlfriend or whatever because like it's just a vlog where you do the positive which
poor girl you know i'm you know she she's consented i'm sure what even eric butts
you mean even eric butts no he loves it i'm sure of him
loves it all what'd you bring me uh an evap stream what i've brought you
that you have brought to me hello any of you got any crazy stories from school other than
that as always semi love to wags um the here's a random crazy story there was the there's the guy
who's really really good sports stuff in my year we're all playing rugby he kicked the ball while
it was lunch time went really high up and it plummeted down right into this little chubby kid
holding two slices of pizza and a drink and it all went onto the floor and he cried and it was
hilarious and sad because that poor child seems so happy with all of that and i'll never forget how
his face turned to misery anyway what have you guys got
sorry what was the question again yeah what was the question school related stories
school related stories just broadly yeah just like one i guess that you remember from a crazy
story from school a kid on my senior uh like the last day for the seniors decided to pull
a prank by bringing a fucking goose to school in his bag and he brought it in he was imagining
he was going to run around and cause chaos but it just got out of the bag frozen with fear fell over
and died and then he went to fucking prison he went to prison because of that he went to jail
for it yes how old was he he got in a lot of fucking trouble he was like 17 18 but it was
like severe animal cruelty like he really was fucking damn yeah i don't know if i would have
put him in jail for it but he he he had like a lot of other drug related charges he was no
stranger to the police in that area of minnesota so it was that was an interesting one all right
rags your turn one time in high school um two of the teachers who i had i had both of them uh one
of them was the principal but he also did some teaching him and another one of the teachers
they would have these little back and forths but they were all in good humor and stuff like jokes
and things and one time uh the principal's home they were like home rooms one time the principal
got the other teachers um like uh he got all the desks all of the chairs and moved them outside
and so we had class outside i don't know this is kind of funny i don't know a lot i'd have to think
about some of the stuff it doesn't immediately come to mind your crazy story seems different
two hours i guess it was just weird that they took all the stuff and they lined them up in a
row and everything just outside in the field and it was funny all right then i get i i don't know
i'd have to think about it i don't keep this information on me at the top of my head um
hello any of you got any crazy oh wait i read that they bullied me out of school so i shall
bully them into camps oba groppin fata bob i really wanted to read that out at the time but
you were talking i didn't want to cut you off well now it's been read in all of its glory
it has been done bob is a goodman at its heart at the core i'm sure of it one day it'll be proven
it'll be the hero that saves us all from something so what's gonna be
cities on mars would save earth it means we can mine rare materials and metals in space and get
power directly from the sun that is one thing bob has right no it doesn't cities on mars can mean
all kinds of things you need to know the state of these cities could be poopy cities could be just
running up could be one city that is or like two small cities and that's it you know like we don't
know the peace on earth war that's gonna mean a lot in terms of human productivity that's just
put it that way and now we've already got space programs going so and i don't know i just think
that that's isn't that automatically a huge win like everybody is no longer suffering from disease
from hunger and this peace like there's no war at that point i'd be kind of concerned that something
dystopian has happened like everybody you wonder at what point after that happens
like isn't that what you're trying to do anyway yeah like all of the advancements like in aid of
doing that to a degree if not exploration uh shout out to b oh blessed southpaw who
released a new video now did he nigh oh my goodness i'm gonna guess it's about sanic
sanic sonic the hedgehog and the future of video game movies that's his video
go and check it out if you want to folks i uh i might give it a watch see once this stream has
come to its end uh was concerned if i hit the pub i might miss the show then i remembered it's
efap also high regs hello it's good you can eat the pub and then come over fine if you were in
a video game what loot would you drop when you die probably like a mask and an elongation tool i
guess like one one condom really why is that i don't know because it's xd random just i
couldn't think of anything better faster oh rags would you drop the shades uh how it would work
no i would drop uh i would drop it'd be a chest but you'd open it up and it would reset your level
back to one damn it would delete all the items tory that's some deep lore there's just a little
note in this as fuck you yeah like good job killing a an innocent dog monster i bet you're
proud of yourself you piece of shit have fun sleeping tonight molar i need to watch terminator
two for class should i watch the theatrical vision or the director's cut director's cut
much better well it's better i need to go back and watch those movies so i'm as a kid but it's
been fucking like 20 years one day rags and i will watch hardcore henry and then we will come
onto efap and discuss it one of the multiple dumbos responding to a cool guy hey we'll get
there eventually yeah i've heard that movie's really good but it is not that day yeah yeah
classic long man we should do a big battlefront too the good one server with the discord sometime
would rock my wags sit on my face and pee oh oh like on you or away from you or you just want to
know that i'm being while i'm doing it i guess because i don't know this could go all kinds of
different ways yeah battlefront classic is awesome and uh we could set something up someday i'm not
sure i think i could pee on someone's face yeah like i have too much empathy for that what if
they love it like me like their ass their legs maybe maybe but even if they love it it's just i
don't think i could piss on someone's face like just knowing that it would like burn their eyes
you're like i have too much empathy to do that to you i don't know does this piss burn your eyes
yes i i've heard it does i've heard it does i have never pissed on my own eyes if you're
fucking accusing me of that i mean i didn't need to accuse it everyone got the implication
please don't make that meme outlast the fucking i hate minorities thing
the second that you ask that a meme doesn't happen what do you think's gonna happen
you say that like i'm not intentionally doing that for a gag well i mean i'm pretty sure you
don't actually want a meme to be that you peeing in your own face but you know i don't really care
peeing on your own face like that's his well known at this point on the internet i'm face
yeah i'm just a fucking dancing monkey on the internet like that's pretty much my fucking
like my my character on twitter so i'm okay with it i'm chasing just the visual of that
face pisser i have one of those shares that leans all the way back so i could feasibly do that
the paramount movies youtube channel quietly released a video called the terminator trilogy
featuring t1 t2 and dark fate great video till it gets to dark fate yeah i think that's funny
because they're like we're the good trilogy guys we're please don't look at the other stuff
um learn the language of our people mauler you fucking shat house is this is this about anime
again i don't know anime language too tough for me i would never watch dr stone it's good rat
dr stone do not know of this i don't know who is the senior stall in your esto no hey mauler wanted
to ask if you've ever seen videos from lobos junior dark souls 2 retrospective if you did
what did you think of it hi rags hello i feel like i know the name lobos junior is he like
one of the streamers for dark souls like he only does dark souls doing like crazy runs and stuff
but i don't think i've seen that video now it could be interesting uh what is your favorite
bayouin drawing and efap meme the favorite drawings are easily the one that's uh the e-family i think
it was called yeah that's a really good one uh favorite meme probably wolf as alex jones that
was one of like awesome pizza
good tisms
thoughts on birds of prey losing to sonic i'm happy that's hilarious i guess i'm seeing sonic
tonight actually as soon as we're done here the girlfriend and i are gonna run off see sonic i'm
probably gonna escape here i'm probably gonna get very stoned in advance just to make it more
amusing yeah uh yes because a lot of people are trying to tie it to the whole they listened
to their community while birds of prey almost like condemned their unity um that's probably
you know an important element i just imagine that it's also nobody fucking knew what birds
of prey was they're like what is that it's like holly quinn like oh hey is that like the joker
and then they're like yeah kind of like oh all right but then you've got um sonic the hedgehog
which fucking i don't even know how many people don't know what sonic the hedgehog is at least to
a minor degree yeah um interesting stuff maula what's your thoughts on the wolfman from 2010
also high rags and catch chase do it try it oh man might catch something
oh is that the one with um anthony hawkins and yeah i saw that i mean i can't remember if it's
good or bad i saw it the same year as god of all four three came out so was that 2010
yeah that was 2010 yeah yeah i was about to say all right then that's when i saw it and i don't
remember a lot of it unfortunately except that there's wolf people in it crazy i know but uh
yeah i'd have to give it a rewatch to know if i thought it was any good but i know that a lot of
people don't like it um i guess wolfman fans big fans of wolfman bad what is your favorite tim
burton movie uh
hello of course ride was cute i like uh cool sprite a lot but
tim burton movies swiney todd scores high i like that a lot swiney todd was very good i'm gonna go
with uh the nightmare before christmas that's you know what big fish is my favorite uh movie i've
seen from him it's been i'd say yeah nightmare and swiney todd yeah i think i'm gonna share that
answer uh nightmare and oh wait batman forever counts as a tim burton movie he's probably a
producer i don't think that i'm gonna go with swiney todd big fish who are your favorite actors
and actresses hmm that's a pretty difficult question to just ask you very broad yeah
i'll tell you what uh scarlet johansson has claimed the actresses lists quite significantly
for me especially after 2019 i'm quite fond of uh christian bales fucking bat shit insane dedication
to his roles yeah i'd say walking phoenix is probably up there now he's just a oh yeah who
gets right into the characters i like robert dani jr obviously quite a bit are we allowed to do
dead actors now as well or no sure christ for lee's like what are my easy favorites forever
it's so fucking awesome baby that's really that's right i have to sit down like fucking research
like the thousands of people out there i love arnie whenever he's in anything ever so much fun
ruby rose of course oh i hate this so much like uh i'm gonna kill this person but she's like
no you shouldn't do that like whoa you're acting phenomenal we haven't even um
seen like there's so much batwoman left rags you know that so much i miss my batwoman mauler we
got two more episodes coming very soon i just can't believe so much i really do love watching
those videos you guys make just the dramatic zooms really sell it yeah the editor does a good job
he's uh he's bringing out the next one soon he said he's almost done with it
and we legitimately enjoy watching them well i i only speak for myself but i legit enjoy watching
it's great the more you forget of watching the episode because then you're like oh my god i
forgot that happened that fucking nonsense so wonderful um but yeah lots just to choose from
with that one yeah that's a decent enough answer uh you dummy mooper you ruined the joke you're
ruined the joke oh because i read out the brackets part i'm sorry ah what do you think about the
buffy the vampire slayer movie that the show is based on it's not very good but um it was it was
all right for its time i suppose like hyper you didn't mention you like buffy don't you
i i i'd say it's an understatement say i like buffy
jurassic world three has officially started filming um are hyped lol
we'll see what happens i'll go see it i'm fucking infinitely tied to jurassic park the film is
fucking great and well we'll see how they do with the newest iteration um i will second
checking out dark on netflix it's a german language show best watched in german with english subs
the english dub is kind of terrible yeah i'm someone who's pretty much always advocates you
watched in the original language just in case they do a poopy just like just like anime
anime snoke looks like a half-shaven testicle or an old booger
i don't know i think he's got
hmm he looks like i don't even know it's hard to say
um gun jesus as a guest we've already got sword jesus shad who's gun jesus
in from forgotten weapons is he okay yeah uh i mean yeah maybe maybe we can pull that off i don't
know i remember that rags the dating my dad quotes from the cinema wins efap he claimed ray and kylo
had a relationship i remarked on it you followed hmm mark my words massive men i will be a guest
on ufap one day until then hi rags hello anything is possible i'm here i don't know
despite all indications to the opposite chase made it here
hey mauler just finished game of thrones after starting it a year ago and what the hell happened
to the writing also thoughts on new clone war season so as for game of thrones rest in peace
that piece of shit show is dead now it will never come back because they destroyed everything
and secondly uh i don't have any interest in clone wars but i might try and get watching it
because i guess uh it would be interesting to stay abreast of everything that's happening
with the release of season seven which is in like a couple days now right that's what i've heard
anyway maybe i'm over exaggerating or under exaggerating that number but i know everyone's
gonna be like guys what do you think i'm gonna be like oh guys we should watch it i guess i wonder
if you can watch it without watching any of the other shit wonder if it would make sense um i i
almost feel like maybe being lost is having fun certainly that's what it was with uh crisis
uninfinitisms i'm you know give it enough time but i'll be like what are they gonna do another
crossover event can't wait i mean how do they top this true hello my e-words when will we be getting
more batwoman episodes so one is close to completion so what day is it now
soon day we could get one on wednesday might might give it the old premiere um you guys there i
suppose if not uh if not the way it'll work basically is if ever i have a video to release
that's not a podcast it'll try and go on the other side of the week wherever the podcast it's
so if we're typically doing saturday's then it should be earlier in the week that we do the
batwoman video but um yeah i'm trying to make it so that there is no week without two efap related
things that come out so yeah we'll get the next bat one episode is on the way uh also high rags
and happy belated birthday oh thank you thoughts on Ahsoka i love her but she should have been killed
by vader i'm afraid that we'd have to have watched the show to be able to give uh further thoughts on
and none of these guests do uh know anything about her as far as i know
yeah i'm not yeah i i'm just not i don't know enough about her i just made brownies chase
ooh i'm very happy for you you mean like pop brownies because those are uh those are a
fucking a gamble every time i mean i guess if you know what you're putting into it are they
a gamble every time um depending on who you buy them from yeah i've had a number of people a number
of friends who have told me about their friends who like they tried an edible and they had a fucking
panic attack and had to go to the er in my head i'm just like you can't just fucking wait yeah
seriously and then they're like and then from that day on they're just like i'm never
touching against the worst thing i've explained to me the resident evil timeline go in spider-man
two pizza guy voice are you excited for resident evil eight i mean i hope it's good but also about
the timeline i don't fucking know i have no idea they just fucking patched it together as they went
i love resident evil but yeah you play it for the interesting sort of uh characters and
settings and monsters sure as hell don't play i have a story no it is a hot mess jace i need my
fix of japanese committing war crimes against romans i mean hey man if that's what does it for
you then yeah gate is great maula why are you racist well sometimes it's just nothing like
if you you watch tlj and you come out not liking it that's just an attribute you get basically
provided to you if you're a bad person comes in the mail and it's like please inject this
racism into yourself and you're like all right to my day the ce of racism gave me a job
they liquefied racism into a pure concentrate crazy but you know that's technology for you
these are 2020 2020 baby uh dorkin said this in 2014 in response to a mother pondering aborting
a down syndrome child abort it and try again it would be immoral to bring it into the world if
you have the choice
well how about that um yeah that's a really complicated subject like if we go into
yeah that's like that's like danger tisms in terms of
people people with mental disabilities should be
killed question mark i was like i don't know about that let's uh let's roll it back a bit
um i mean if we're talking about early fetus
well yeah because there are some questions that you can answer that this stuff like would you
choose it or would you not choose it if there was a choice from being in a neutral position it's
like i guess i would choose not to have that then it's like therefore sort of thing um
apparently followed up with my true intention was simply to say what i would personally do
based upon my own assessment of the pragmatics of the case and my own moral philosophy which
in turn is based on a desire to increase happiness and reduce suffering
i mean if if it was a um if it was like a like any other like pre sentient fetus in the womb
then down syndrome or not and it's not like a person yet so i'd be fine with it but once it
gets past that point then i'm uh i'm against it because i'm one of those um i'm pretty much in
the camp of if you're gonna have an abortion which i don't like then you better do it really
early before it you know you know is a human in that sense so i think that makes sense
there was actually really interesting also someone said that aborting a fetus via catapult
his murder i just want to share that with you um it's a good visual yeah there's like a bunch
of fucking polls done that shows that like people on the left and the right both generally agree
that like for the people that for the people on the right that do are like the are okay with
abortion they're like i'd be as long as you do it before like the certain term then it's
fairly humane yeah it's got to be really early nobody says you know uh masturbating is genocide
so it's just yeah it's just it's like people aren't as fucking like polar opposites on that
policy as everyone thinks how is isekai anything like sol also konosuba didn't start the entire
genre that'd be sao get your facts straight chase yeah i was i was waiting for that is that the guy
whose name starts with short no that was grish nag okay because there's one guy whose name starts
with short that's just been fucking wailing on me for like the better part of a half hour
like just donation after donation uh yeah no that was i i said immediately if you remembered
that isekai i thought people were referring to konosuba as i just mistakenly thought that
they were talking about konosuba instead they mentioned the entire genre uh yeah i really don't
know much about you is it uh isn't it essentially just like a man and like a foreign land and he's
kind of to make the make the most of it and make friends and everything there because i don't have
a problem with the with it if that's the case but yeah konosuba i just watched it for like eight
episodes and i was like yeah whatever so my mistake i do not mean to generalize genres
don't worry you've got plenty more to come of people ripping on you yeah oh yeah i know
uh who are your childhood crushes mine is asoka
asoka is that an anime character it sounds really familiar star wars
oh jesus fucking shows you how much i know if ever you don't recognize it we do it's not anime
um yeah um no comment so mauler probably
buffy and willow they were both really hot and then uh erin's son he was uh pretty damn awesome
in far scoped do 2d characters count
yeah you're allowed to choose them uh because all you guys uh from what i heard i was gonna say
made marion from rawnood so it doesn't matter what you say yeah i guess that's true uh i i
thought tron bond from mega man legends and the misadventures of tron bond was uh extremely cute
she's sassy she's technologically proficient she comes from a family of villains so she's a bad a
bad girl she's pretty cool yeah all right jace you dissing rising of the shield hero have you
seen it if not you should also oh wait do you want to address that i don't know
uh i have not seen shield hero i've seen a lot of people say that it's really good and i'm inclined
to believe them uh i literally don't even have an image in my head of what but i've heard people
talk about it a fucked on on twitter uh i'm sure it's great i'll have to check it out
and also mauler my review of tron somehow became longer than yours
oh my god oh my god the long men are among us i thought gate was good there you go chase they
thought it was good i'm happy you enjoyed it shonen doesn't mean it's bad hunter x hunter
is shonen and it's great uh okay i imagine that's what's gonna be for a lot of these
she's like fine leave me alone oh no you have to understand these are my people right these
are the fucking degenerate weeaboos that these are the degenerate weeaboos that all they do is
they watch like fucking 10 to 15 episodes of an anime a day idly like minimum and then they go
online and they talk about the girls that are great and which girls are bad and all these
you know very subjective things about uh traits of the show but which is fine like i don't have
any problem with that but they get really really fucking heated like they it's like they're in it
for the blood sports so if you talk about any anime you don't like which all my opinions are
just like i don't like it i think it's shitty people think i'm disparaging the entirety of
everything about it whereas usually it's something i saw a little bit about and i'm like yeah it
didn't really catch me fair enough like i was i was talking to rags and i was like i think you'd
enjoy monster and he was just like uh it didn't really seem like it's for me and i was like really
what about it and he was just like it just doesn't really look like anything that would interest me
and i was just like yeah none of it so you shouted at him until he gave you more right
especially if i'm gonna i i've got back into guild wars too and that's its own fucking rabbit
hole of shit to go through so i don't want to delve into another game right now yeah fair
enough i mean i already have a fucking massive backlog because it is too yugioh is the only good
shonen yugioh is fucking great uh because like no yugioh it's like everyone's like oh it's just a
goofy anime about like cards and stuff like that which yeah it is and it gets it gets progressively
weirder as the show goes on but if you've ever watched yugioh season zero which is the one that
didn't come out in america but they sort of um they localized it in manga form it's like really
fucking dark like uh fucking the pharaoh like yami yugi that comes out of the protagonist he's like
really sadistic and he fucking smiles at people as they're like being sent to hell like it's really
it's really twisted and there's like violence and there's like implied rape in one episode like
or someone attempting to uh rape a character and uh yeah it's it's like the best part of the entire
fucking series definitely go check it out uh yeah this is a great episode who is this ducking retad
who talks like he knows about anime if you want an anime expert talk to arch warhammer oh yeah
probably if you want to get him on i didn't know he was into the animes i did not know that either
uh rags i only if you find uh oh sorry i was just gonna say if you if you find someone else that
completely renders me obsolete then yeah get them on that was totally fine as most people do
i'm so sorry rags i only just watched four horseman podcast five before that i didn't
think i could possibly love you more i was wrong that's nice hmm so much love so much
trinity blood chase oh trinity blood chase i guess yeah i was talking to someone in chat about
that earlier i actually completely don't really remember anything about trinity blood there were
a bunch of anime back in like the early 2000s i think that all had the word blood in the name
and a lot of them just appealed to like the more female viewers the female viewers that won all the
gay vampire yaoi and uh is that how you pronounce it yeah yaoi it's like the fucking
soft core because a lot of the times that's what uh that's what people say on their well
let me look it up i might be totally fucking off base about that i don't know i've only seen it
written and i learned what it is but i have no idea how it's supposed to be pronounced i'm pretty
sure trinity blood is the one i'm thinking of where there's like little yaoi here and i really
i don't have an opinion i have uh only ever seen it on adult swim i think just passing by
but it is definitely for the the goth ones who like a lot of uh sort of castlevania themes
it looks cool but didn't really catch me mha is villains then training arc then repeat
yes although i will say i think someone got mad at me for this later my friend just uh messaged me
who's watching the stream uh fucking uh how you doing tag and he messaged me and said you clearly
didn't see the nearest season of my hero academia where someone dies and i'm like yeah i should
probably go give me another chance then how does it feel to be wrong about anime all the time
uh you know i'm kind of used to it if i can go on the internet and talk about anything
especially when it's like i have like a fucking career and like my youtube channel and like a
love life and everything so it's like when i was younger and i didn't have those things i was
watching anime like crazy and getting super into them and doing nothing but that but now that i'm
older and i have other priorities i'm like yeah i'm probably wrong about what you just said is you
have a life and so you don't care that they think you're wrong about stuff thanks a lot i know it
comes i know it comes off like that a little bit i genuinely don't mean to diss anyone if they like
don't have some of those things you just literally everyone it's kind of fucked up yeah actually
maybe uh touch of a giant fucking pussy huh anything about that speaking of the next super
chat chase doesn't know shit about anime sign in like berserk are not for teens also read berserk
is phenomenal also high rex hello berserk is phenomenal and again that goes back to people
thinking i was dismissing an entire genre uh i really like seinen someone spelled it s-a-i-n-e-n
which would be like sign in but it's s-e yeah they said s-a-i but it's s-e-i so that threw me off i
was like oh i guess there's something called sign in that's like more adult oriented but no it's
just fucking seinen seinen is great it's it's always much more uh adult oriented and most of
my favorite anime is seinen death note is great except for the second half kotky ass is good too
kotky ass is good but listen all of you pussies who fucking yeah i'm not going to spoil it but
all of you pussies who stopped watching at that part in death note just because your favorite
character was removed from the picture what the fuck just why it doesn't make any sense it's still
a good show you still get to see the main how the main character's fate is met and it's like you
see a lot of other things like he fucking becomes god and he literally succeeds in his plan and
everything and that that character's not being there anymore that character not being there anymore
is all part of that it's a fuck it's still a good show yes near is objectively not as
charming or interesting or even as intelligent as uh as the other guy but uh fuck off girl pair just
because a character you like is gone doesn't mean i stopped watching after that happened i just
didn't it's like a fucking protest vote it's so stupid it's a still fucking good show uh death
stranding is just kojima's four-year-long self-aggrandizing wank session also high
round yes hello it really is honestly i'm not going to get started on again because i said as
much as i needed to that last time but yeah no it's literally just him being a super pretentious
artsy fucking fag word and uh just talking about how interesting and and fucking cultured
his tastes are literally you find little like easter eggs around the game and it'll give you
little kind of key item trinkets and one of them is literally telling the player about how
hideo kojima went to an islandic record store and found the band loud roar and that's like how he
came to appreciate their music and it was at that point that he uh imagined norman redis walk like
riding his bike along a fucking dystopian plane and i was just like suck my dick that is the
stupidest fucking thing i've ever heard he just really wanted everyone to know he's super cool
and has good taste uh hi mauler hello and hi some random guy just fucking moving on from that
i'm not fucking what am i going to say about death stranding i played it
i just say how you're like you're like um anyway it's in the tone um chase i want i watched the
ghost in the shell movie with scar joe that i immediately watched the anime movie afterwards
kind of like the live action movie better how many lashes for this um the live action movie
yeah it was okay it wasn't like amazing it was uh it was cool it was cool looking that
it was pretty faithful the characters uh felt like they weren't completely just bastardized
uh i forget the name of the dude with like the synthetic eyes off the top of my head the one
he's voiced by richard epker in the dump but uh that's uncle uh it's uh it's like two syllables
right yeah it's a short name it's not baco or something is it saito hold on a second ghost in
the shell characters oh forget bato that's what it is bato yeah yeah yeah i really i really like how
they portrayed bato it was very accurate although togusa i don't was he in the movie i don't remember
him being there at all i think there there were they were a few of them were in it but they were
just almost like cameo appearances it was basically right no i thought it was it was really cool though
i had a nice ghost in the shell themed drink that the the movie theater provided at the time it was
like a fucking blue colored uh thing and i was just like this is neat so that probably colored
my opinion i was like hey it was a i think they kept the important stuff from what the
show tries to say but yeah but they kept it like simple enough to where like a general audience
could enjoy it yeah although he really really liked it and he doesn't like anime or japanese
like films or anything a really a lot of foreign films at all but he liked this yeah it wasn't
wasn't dysuke aramaki wasn't he played by fucking uh that guy who made that old nes game something's
challenge you know i'm talking about john john did that video on that game it was like
fuck chat help me out what was that game something shingeki's challenge or something like that
it's not shingeki takashi takashi takashi katana takashi katana i'm pretty sure
was fucking uh uh aramaki in the movie i think that's who he was he was aramaki that blew my
mind that being said it was uh really it's hard to find a real person who looks like the anime
version of him he can't really find anybody so i was just like i have to get a because because
he's in like uh he was a twitchy and stuff like that well that's a keshi just he's he looked so
fucking mentally checked out that whole time in the movie he was just like he's good to see the
guy from uh mxc in there i don't think but yeah no the ghost in the show is great and uh i actually
have not seen the movie that's definitely on my list though i've been watching it lately by the
way for those of you who have not watched mxc it is one of the most cleverly written hilarious
shows ever i forget which one that shows them all f in chat for ra i think he's gone sad face
i have seen in a while uh he uh there's a chance he was banned like as in from youtube
because i remember him having to switch accounts based on uh didn't chastity sent but yeah i don't
know where he is um does somebody actually sent me uh there's an updated uh portion on
efap.me the official website of every frame of pause
so it's been updated with the truth i guess the truth comes out
i'm just i'm glad that we have scholars to keep track of these important pieces of information
because otherwise they'd be lost to time not that
yes i recently watched submarine 2010 mainly because of alex tinner's soundtrack but i love
the movie any of you fuckers watched it i'm afraid not submarine doesn't sound familiar
submarine yeah that doesn't ring any bells have a look see if i recognize the
no
um so thoughts yeah i'm sorry don't have any also high rags and cunty hello
hello yeah i'll answer to cunty chase mhgu is better gameplay uh no it objectively does not
but uh it does have a much greater spread of uh monsters it has some strengths but uh
yeah no the monster in the world blows every other fucking monster in our game out of the water
in terms of gameplay at first i thought chase's anime opinions were a little garbage but to be
honest they're just weak shallow trash you need a better anime person jeez yeah i i saw that and uh
i mean if that's how you feel then you're exactly the kind of people i was talking about before
like just the anime fans who i can just have to dunk on you at every possible opportunity
a lot of uh what some people are saying in chet is just because they thought i was dismissing
an entire genre because i didn't understand that isekai was a genre uh i don't really watch a lot
of isekai um anime by the way this is a stream i'm just like literally talking off the top of my
head oh excuses excuse me if i felt really strongly about something i would just make a
video about it and i would make absolutely sure that i would dot my i's and cross my t's but
yeah i really cared i say a lot of no i say a lot of really wrong shit all the time because
i just view this as like we're just hanging out and saying but it's yeah it's probably way more
than 17 l blade has repetitive gameplay fight me rags it you're correct it does have repetitive
gameplay okay fight is over congratulations i agree the the weakest part of that game was the
was the combat and some of the puzzles some of them were pretty good um i guess that's why
but it stuck with it that's why in in terms of pure subject isms that game is one of my favorite
ever made um but that's because it really the story the adventure the journey the environments
the dialogue the acting really really stuck with me and i thought they were fantastically done
and i just got pulled into that game um but it's definitely flawed in a few senses
so i i understand why not everybody loved it and adored it as much as i did
don't watch anime the entire industry is geared towards making cliche riddled adaptations read
the source material written better 90 percent of the time yeah no honestly very true yeah um the
only time i like i really prefer anime most of the time if the soundtrack is phenomenal
because yeah most of the time when you adapt something from manga into anime then uh it just
looks a lot worse and they have to take a lot of shortcuts and sort of try to condense it erased
for example uh fucking i'm trying to remember what the japanese name was because it's not quite
it doesn't really translate into a race it means like the town which only i do not exist like
that's a fucking really great anime a really great um intellectual property uh and the manga
flushes out all this dark shit that they probably just couldn't put in tv uh and then they just made
the ending of the anime really lackluster and it's like okay when you read the manga and you're like
oh yeah that actually ties up all blue sins in short yes even a total normie or a rando like
me would do better chase thinks a show is trash because it's in a genre come the fuck on dude
make some real zang arguments hate on isekai for trash reasons yeah we covered this already
i was mistaken about the genre i get this next question thanks for the money
jesus make it any of that shit your turn what'd you say rex you ain't getting any of that shit
no not not me i'm not with your terrible opinions thank you for your hatred to chat
it sounds like rags like the story of a gameplay uh it's not just the story in this case um i didn't
think that the gameplay was bad um if i did i'm not sure it depends on what the hypothetical would
have been but in this instance i think that the environments in the exploration aspect and the
story the dialogue and acting was good enough to make up for the shortcomings of the gameplay
but that's very very subjective if i was going to objectively criticize hellblade i could come
up with plenty of things um hi i'm the guy who makes made pickles with his wife last week we
made bread making more this weekend all right uh hi rags hello kick j drink milk praise the dawn
amen amen molar i've been thinking about this conundrum for some time maybe you can provide an
answer since i can't but why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of a plane
well it guarantees the kill all right that's that's why you can't have them falling in such
a way that they end up not dying and then spreading the word of your kiltisms makes sense
vein was stupid to question it i know the reference very well oh also really quickly
someone uh sorry someone made a good point they said chases just fucking making all these weeaboos
mad and just getting mauler extra money so that they can argue with me should do this more often
fucking just leaves me rags to be silent for the most part we're just like oh yes those sub genres
of anime yeah i know i'm just abusing your platform um oh my ghost dub is great two dollars
for recommending it all right it is some good shit i need a break from dark souls now the moonlight
butterfly is really pissing me off i've been trying to kill it for the past half an hour
oh don't tell people you're stuck on moonlight butterfly don't don't tell people um chat he
didn't say it okay he's he said he sounds gay he said uh he was stuck because uh he was he was
stuck on um what's the hardest boss from dark souls one uh candy corn the eviscerator uh he
was stuck on austenian smoke guys okay that's very well he and he's not using summons and he's
brand new to the game that's where he's going okay it wasn't moonlight butterfly shut up since you did
one with uh i hit everything can you please consider doing a one-on-one with jack saint
uh i'm not sure how i feel about jack saint in general it's like very pretty hard to watch his
video and not assume he was like incredibly malicious he often says some stuff on twitter
that's really uncharitable towards my positions but then simultaneously he's able to have a sense
of humor about a couple things he's said a lot of nice things in relation to uh certain events that
took place over time so i'm very conflicted about it all um maybe maybe someday also will
you guys ever give jared and other chads i i don't uh i don't even know what he's doing these days
like i i hope which to be clear by the way like he he thinks that we're terrible horrible people
probably yeah i'm pretty sure he doesn't like us so he'll be fine
yes uh sometimes world peace can be achieved by sending the undesirables and the jews to space
just look at gundam big z on well well plus you've worn everything maybe nice save chase also mhgu
is better than monster hunter world yeah we were going back and forth about this it's uh
we already answered this it has better monsters it's not a better game
um rags and chase do you know about the way forward act it's some scary shit
uh i looked it up a little bit ago and um i don't know enough about um the actual like bill to
comment on it but people are saying it's gonna allow more illegal immigrants with criminal
backgrounds to get into the united states apparently uh let's see let's see uh
they would all but eliminate detention for immigration purposes and oppose new burdens
as uh let's see uh yeah i'd have to look on it um looks like a lot of information it would
repeal the criminal grounds of illegal entry and re-entry into the united states oh that's i mean
these are a bunch of bullet points but i'm already like uh restrictions on ice and border patrol
agents and making immigration arrests um let's see
let's see yeah i have to this looks like a very yeah i if i was an illegal immigrant this seems
to be something that i would really want to pass also check out this meme someone tweeted at me
um good old titties yeah you're the best looking one
jig old biddies dirty dirty anime jay look at me i like that er is fittingly in the background
uh chase right about minorities wrong about everything else
uh yeah i'm wrong about a lot greetings gentlemen hi rags hello i've made a video based on your
ideas from efap 36 it's on youtube as the dawn story efap meme hope you guys like it and maybe
consider reviewing it on efap i will make a note give it the old checaroonie at some point
point no don't do that please watch it all i'm not sure oh they're referencing uh death note i
think don't watch the movie without the show rags is probably not gonna want to watch the
whole show maybe maybe actually because it was only one season that's possibly yeah but he said
there's like 30 something episodes damn well we can always give it a few testers right and then
be like yeah we can continue or we can be like nah this is anime maybe maybe fun fact both sonic
movie and doctor stone r etc so they're bad right chase kekekekekekekeke uh
yeah it's like the third this is the third time i've been clear up that i was wrong about uh
isakai how's it feel we're gonna probably get to like 17 before it's over it's honestly just
kind of intimidating i'm like i fucking really upset this person hbo will be fine
just trying not to fucking cry chase god why don't they make an anime where
people are transported and stuck in raid shadow legend and they have to convince
their overlord to like spend real money so that they survive everything like that
HBO will make Game of Thrones Brotherhood I'm certain of it I wouldn't
even be against that you can't make it animated honestly there's many actors
back that you can and write it better hi rags hello I thought you'd just like to
know that I bought my first gun a single-action Ruger in 22 yeah on the
birthday as well oh really still haven't had a chance to shoot it though because
all the ranges around here require you to be a member oh really that's really
huh that's interesting I hope you guys don't die watching the next few episodes
of Batwoman oh I think the closer to death they get the more entertaining it
becomes for us yeah the closer to death that like only Chan is watching you yes
hi rags hello if baby is abortion does it become an orphan Shun orphan Shun
questions for the ages I'm sure chase what do you think about darker than
black ah I have not seen it I've heard good things and that's kind of an older
one I had a lot of friends of mine that watched it but I like fell off right
around the time that Fullmetal Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was wrapping up
and then I just stayed out of anime for like a couple of years when I was in
college and I got really distracted by other stuff and then I by the time I
came back I was like oh fuck I know like nothing about anything I've just
been trying to catch up chase molar I missed it would you efap the reaction to
how it should have ended TROS yeah no cuz a lot of it is the kind of stuff
that we've sort of joked about before so a lot of it would just be we watch them
do a visual vision of it we laugh and then move on I don't think there's much
to have in terms of contention with that that video so I just don't you would
work very well that's all I prefer I probably sorry I probably got to go in
like the next um like 15 minutes or something like that that's no problem I
prefer Yu-Gi-Oh! GX dubbed that show is bonkers yeah I've seen some clips of
that out of context they have like a very goofy self-awareness where they're
just like I'm gonna beat you with the children's card game like they it's
still not great but it's pretty clever I have life so it doesn't matter if I'm
completely ignorant of subjects if you're ignorant of subject just don't
opine on it you sizzling butter cake people ask me what I think yeah that is
that is a good insult
as far as good rat anime goes watch perfect blue and paprika paprika is
great and the perfect blue is phenomenal as well that's uh why am I
forgetting his name right now I did a fucking video on him and everything but
the guy I made paprika paranoia agent perfect blue etc a millennial actress
he's phenomenal definitely check out anything he's done Satoshi cone that's
his name okay oh and you guys read comics and if not what would make you
read more just curious no nothing no I don't it's just not really interested in
the medium and the time it takes to get through it all I think they're cool I
read Simpsons comics a lot when I was younger what would make me read them now
is probably if like I just was very aware of a really well-written series of
comics that I loved you know it's kind of self-fulfilling like in order to want
to read more of it I would have had to be into it already but I'm not and yeah
it's just a medium that I don't think appeals to me that much unfortunately
even though I do think it's kind of cool but I kind of the other way about most
mediums you know at their best they're all pretty awesome I think the thing
because obviously I'm more of like a manga guy because that's really the only
distinction right comics are just like American guest Wow really never but like
there was there was a really cool someone who's more in touch with comics
actually told me I was talking about how cool like the original Resident Evil
comic series was back in the day and then I think someone someone tweeted me
and said oh yeah that was this guy he's a fucking like the guy who did all the
illustrations it's like he's been a huge mainstay in the comics industry and
like all the gore was really fucking good-looking in the Resident Evil comics
but for the most part I'm just not really into it it always seems a little
bit samey to me I had a friend you guys know trailer Drake he's like a well-known
sort of he's like a well-known sort of cuck now on Twitter but he he and I used
to be tight here in Texas and he lent me like a he lent me a comic cuz I was like
I don't really like comics he's like you gotta fucking read this and it was
it was just like a generic like black guy gets like superpowers and he's like
lives in the suburbs I was like okay and I tried just couldn't get into it I try
to find the name of it Code Geass abridged is amazing there is
only soup a bridge series debate me chase you ding-dong conclusion jumper
yeah sure at me on Twitter I love the talk can confirm waifu wars are serious
business yeah makes sense to me
I had a dream last week all of my friends were sitting down at a restaurant
for a birthday party and all of a sudden Quentin reviews comes up and pulls up a
chair we instantly stood up and walked away chanting efap efap I hope that was
a real dream that sounds hilarious
what's everyone's opinion on fanfiction go nuts have fun it can be terrible it
can be good if you like it do it yeah yeah I mean I don't really waste my time
with anything that isn't like done by the actual creator I'm sure there's like
phenomenal fan fictions out there that are way better than the actual source
material I just haven't read any myself
how can I trust anything chase says when he lies to look like he knows about a
subject how do I know he's lying about other things to save face yeah I added
them nice I know I this is fucking the anime fandom dude I added them and I
said what did I lie about and I think they responded maybe it was a different
person but they said they were just like being retarded for like the memes I
don't know but yeah that whoever made that donation tell me what I lied about
and I will recuse myself if I did you know the follow-up says I was acting
retarded for the superchats do who I think they're saying that about you
right oh yeah yeah they were um yeah that makes sense now I first thought
they were talking about themselves like I mean listen guys they follow up with
rags wallow where did you dig up this moron listen I think we got on the wrong
foot here is a bit of a misunderstanding I've never claimed to be an expert in
anime I just really like the ones that I have seen I like anime just because I'm
like one of the only guys on the show that likes anime doesn't mean I'm like
fucking this progenitor of all things Japan but I uh yeah we're just sitting
and talking about anime and people ask me questions and I'm just like saying
whatever comes off the top of my head and then because the epap audience is so
aggressively interested in sort of dismantling bad arguments they see that
as sort of like this weak spot and they just go for the fucking jugular I mean
honestly if I say something incorrect I'm totally open to discussion you want
fucking tweet at me and be like I know you said this about my hero academia but
it actually gets way better then I'll be like oh yeah I should probably check it
out then if I was mistaken but yeah I'm not trying to say that all of my
opinions are ironclad I just I'm just sharing my opinions they're not they
could they're probably shit to varying degrees and I know nothing about anime
for the most part so I'm just like do do do do like this has been one of the
least pleasant fucking epaps I've ever been on just because I fucking stirred
the hornet's nest oh we can't help you nor can we condemn you we can't do
anything at first I'm like ah they're just fucking around and then the tides
time passes I'm like oh my god yeah you shouldn't think they're joking rags I
confronted angry Joe on his only uneducated people vote for Trump he
replied with a poll showing that non-college graduates voted for Trump oh
okay so yeah if you if you go to college you're intelligent and if you don't
you're an idiot I imagine that poll was representative of just every voter it's
like come on I remember that he said that didn't be it like a video and he
got in loads of trouble for it because people were like what the fuck are you
doing god that feels like it was ages ago that's crazy I should have been a
fucking big-brain galaxy level genius and voted for Clinton he's such a good
person for a bit last one I promise the reason Chase's arguments are irritating
is cuz they're like straw men like TLJ haters just hate women you're just
wrong I failed to see the comparison whatsoever yeah I'm not sure what
argument you made this similar to that and like did you say people tend to hate
blah blah blah because of blah blah blah at some point and I missed it maybe I
don't remember actually since Chase is leaving you should get on on you oh it's
literally the guy who's posting orders your adobe guru with opinions that are
terrible for this efap I heard he's a pretty cool guy I mean we don't mean
anime experts they just they just happen to be those people they're not brought
on because they're anime experts and higher chase for his anime experts you
know I guess the other one would be yeah weekend warrior Appa Bend yeah we can
worry sounds like he knows who he's talking about Appa Bend got roasted by
the fap chat what is second appears to ever that rags he came in he had bad
opinions apparently
I'm I think that it's probably likely that every person who likes anime has
quote-unquote bad anime opinions yeah I mean there I mean you've seen those
we're talking about this before rags about just like how you probably wouldn't
enjoy most like sort of anime styled games because a lot of them are just
made for like bottom feeding mouth breathers that just want to throw as
much money as possible into the game for like cosmetics and stuff there's so many
anime games that for years and years and years sit at $60 and and never fucking
go on to go on sale or anything and so there's a lot of really aggressive I'm
not saying that about I'm not setting up a straw man there's just like a there's
a lot of people that buy those in substantial enough volumes that they
keep making them so I feel like to some degree the anime community
supplying that kind of makes me question what is good taste in anime
you schlub I've been writing a book for my own enjoyment and simultaneously
writing a screenplay vision of it helps me balance things like exposition visual
descriptions character thoughts etc you think more movies such books could
benefit from this so like instead of maybe creating the original and then
adapting it to another medium you just write both mediums at the same time got
to be unconventional for sure but maybe that I could help people out like
trying to simultaneously fit the story into different mediums makes you think
more about everything's framed and what's important and what isn't good
work but it also is going to take a lot longer and it might create some waste in
terms of like if you don't pursue one version despite taking new ages very
interesting though one more on a scale of one to ten how many emotion tisms did
you get when Gandalf and the Rohirrim arrived at the Battle of Helms deep I
almost get embarrassingly emotional like rags during endgame I just love that
scene yeah it's pretty awesome though honestly I get maybe not when I first
watched these films cuz I really can't remember anymore these days I get more
of a sense of like it just more more emotion tisms when they reveal the whole
Rohirrim army on palinal fields like yeah it's such a like oh that fucking
it's like a it all the sea of horses and they're about to clash into all of
Mordor's armies is so fucking epic the Helms deep ones awesome as well though
you know I'm gonna put it out there hot take Lord of the Rings is pretty good if
you can believe it yeah and pretty good pretty good stuff
probably you guys gonna do anything on the new Picard series I'm afraid I'm not
even watching the show nor am I able to be able to compare it to the older
stuff I just there are there are people who will take care of that like redlet
meteor and nerd erotic critical drinker I believe all of them are on that that's
one of our we're not experts on that one it was my opinion chaseface I mean you
know some of this stuff is just just an opinion like if he doesn't like anything
that's the funny thing it's like I if I if I try to explain myself more they go
oh now you're just say it's like the bracket sentence where that like the
fucking green text to like misrepresent you as a currently as possible I guess
the easiest way for you to piss everyone off any fat was just yeah yeah does
whatever terrible thing you think of me you're probably right about and you're
you're you're free to feel that way chase just see it as getting more
awesome cash yeah that's what I was saying earlier it's not why I did it but
it's wrong there's been a surprising amount of responses to you in Super
Chats though like you I've been seeing them in real I've been seeing them in
real time like how am I gonna bond to that chase is wrong kick J oh there you
go you avoid the kicking at least yeah chase opinions on demolition D he was a
big part of my start in anime stuff and if you don't think about him definitely
check him out yeah I responded them in text a demo his he's douchebag chocolate
on YouTube if you guys haven't seen him he's just kind of the OG like memer
anime reviewer but he's a really nuanced anosis shit just very very clever very
very Kurt and brash and yeah inappropriate yeah no he was just demolition
D originally and then I don't know when he changed his name to douchebag chocolate
but he makes a lot of good points and everything he reviews very on point
oh and hi Rax hello shout out to the other guy who's mentioned sands and
smash usually that's my job and I appreciate it oh and hi all even you
chase have a good evening chase on an out-of-state medical transfer when our
ambulance broke down oh that's where they are right now we're sitting in a
crowded airport at least there's efap high rags oh hey damn wasn't really
necessary out of state medical transport a sport on ambulance and now they're
waiting in the airport I that must mean that things are okay right yeah I hope
they're okay well regardless I hope you get out of the airport soon that is a
terrible place to be for a long period of time the anime industry is almost
100% corporate adaptations imagine crossing the most popular stories of all
time of the time that's what they do I am so sorry I'm not trashing chase
because I like him be Baca of you to be back it's actually meant to be right
Baca Baca there's not two bees and then Baca let's you've misrepresented that
super chat you should be funny well not normally it's a bubble Baca that they
got it wrong so and then the last one today's efap is high chase with a heart
and a smile oh I needed that thank you now I will be doing jumping between
overflow and new stuff oh here we go I guess someone asked me to check out a
video to show rags and see him potentially laugh at it I guess thing is
I don't think I can show it on efap I looked at it it's like a tad adultie I
don't know what would happen I don't know if we're allowed or whatever but I
will try and show rags I guess after the stream maybe if I remember to do so but
it's pretty retarded but kind of funny depending on whatever you think so
hopefully rags will see it and then he can say what he thought and that will
conclude the super chat request and then I probably got to go oh right now now
you can read like two three more and then I'll be good from the when we do
the premieres of infinity tisms there's some super chats on those ones I've been
grabbing them up so we can read them on here I guess this one says hi rags hi
this one says g'day faggots I don't know how that managed to get past the super
yeah but it came right in and I just yeah you'd think YouTube would
automatically defend that one but no just came right in moobles what do you
think what do you wrap sorry what do you rags and I guess chase what do you think
of Robert Battson a year ago I would have laughed at the idea but after
seeing the lighthouse I think you could pull it off also high chance I agree I'm
ready for it I'm ready to take a look I'm ready to see what he comes up with
are you sure I do not what is Robert oh is that is that Robert Patterson is
Batman mm-hmm you figured it out uh I mean fucking Ben what's his name to
give it a shot
Shapiro's Batman imagine him intimidating any moment that voice let's
see this rattles off the bat man yeah yeah no I mean we'll see yeah I mean I'm
hopeful yeah could be good weaves can be a vicious bunch just think of it as a
defense mechanism it is is there nothing you guys can cover to make this go
longer oh oh you know I'm sure you pull something out of our ass
well it's another meme selection left and we're coming up to five hours but
still got overload overflow to do so don't worry
hello fellow efappers this is Star Wars sequels for the frisked seasons of flash
and an arrow everything dies check greedful and as yours legacy everybody
hmm hey poop I got here late that's all right
and you left it's outside space time and the budget apparently haha get it the
the thing they say the flashpoint or whatever thing outside space and time
this and said it's outside of the budget too oh shit crisis on infinite
Earth's episode bruh they're all that in fairness it's a crisis on infinite ah
who gives a crap yeah I know the speed force is gonna be DC's explanation for
everything like the force was for Rey and Star Wars lol kind of the speed
force is used for a whole bunch of things in infinite isms
molar is a poo-poo head ha I got him ha P P poo poo another fantastic super chat
whoa oh we got bought in chat disgusting I am offended
oh James Moore usually kills them but he's not here today um I guess I could
kill him you able to pull up chat right now rags are you in games yeah I got it
I got a chat going fucking you got any you got a you got a spanner right you
can nail those those those porn accounts whatever they are yeah I can do
it can't with me lying mention from brinny chat with me I'm live that's true
I don't know why they're using those emojis because that makes them stand
out yeah it makes it really easy to spot them yeah boop I'm live you gone but
bigger and all the time I you deserve whatever virus you get through all the
things to be reintroduced to you by efap an old minecraft youtuber who I
previously only knew from hearing his name in old Seth bling videos wasn't
what I would have expected small world indeed old minecraft youtuber I don't
remember us talking about an old minecraft youtuber fair enough let's
like PewDiePie awesome yes molar I love you oh very kind hello rags hello
sending a virtual head pat oh thank you she is to the upside down
fringy you would appreciate that and it just after that there's a full stop and
there just says metal full stop metal would appreciate that to help with
fringy's therapy bills also high molar thank you and hello all right those are
caught up with now now we're into the true overflow ooh so this is I believe
still the narrow video ones getting there oh why didn't fellowship end with
them destroying the ring this proves TLJ is a good movie I think that's in
relation to his like thing about how Titanic doesn't end with the ship
getting destroyed and he thinks that's like that was weird the whole video was
weird that was terrible video mm-hmm how do you cover so many people with such
bad takes you still have guys like this that surprised me with how much of a
lunchbox they are I don't know they're all out there they're all out there now
my number six movie of all time blood diamond boards have you guys seen that I
have not I know very very strong from what I remember but it's been a long
time is not the one with Leonardo DiCaprio no Leonardo DiCaprio isn't it
what did I say gee Mon Han Su is in it as well I think ah she mall you're more
hosted good things I feel like it's my catchphrase at this point I hear good
things mm-hmm you ever hear bad things often
also high rags hello wolf will miss your buds and long man the fact that you like
bounty hunter is awesome yeah I know Star Wars is cool shit hello again
mauler I have some questions cosmonauts new Star Wars video when that could
happen sooner rather than later he's an interesting fellow on Twitter you know I
don't know I never know what to expect from him but I don't think he's gonna
appreciate us responding to Star Wars videos but they're just so tismally made
that I really want to talk about them and we've always loved an opportunity to
talk about the the prequels it'll be neat to go for them and then of course
his sequel videos where I think he talks about how if you do anything
objectively you're a stupid so it'd be nice to have a look at his amazing
arguments that's all um but yeah coming soon those ones what do you think about
the there's only two good Star Wars movies so that's referencing a new hope
and Empire I guess I still think return of the Jedi is good
yes it just depends on where we draw lines because it's tough which in the
Jedi has a lot of tism in it but the last portion of the film pretty damn
strong so like I would need to really think hard exactly if I would
categorize it as if we called good above five out of ten like enough of it to
survive that then it probably is yeah so at least say three but I don't know that
I'm against the idea of referring to revenge of the Sith as a good film I
would need to give that a really long rewatch and then I'm probably safely
happy calling everything from Disney bad like none of it gets over five out of
ten something I'm happy to say Rogue One scores the highest if that's the case
but I mean fucking hell you know
would return of the Jedi count as a good Star Wars movie well we just answered
that I guess and ps we love you wolf and hi wags hello does Ryan Johnson have
a lazy eye I don't know I don't think so I don't think so either remember boys if
you kill your enemies you lose oh I remember that piece of advice which is
better TLJ or Titanic don't let the fact that I'm one of them sway you either I
think that might have been from the captain Titanic's way better than TLJ
at least I think so if we talk about the movies I think mr. blink his video on
Titanic is still really really good in terms of doing it a fair assessment I
reckon yeah I like going a lot a mola big fan your Dark Souls 2 response series
is my favorite of all your videos I was recently playing the game and while I've
had fun with it at times I really wish it was made better I wish that to
mechanically it's a fucking nightmare sometimes we get called sexist racists
man babies idiots a toxic brood of hate mongers and yet we're the crazy ones
right well I mean that logic would follow right who would be the crazy ones
if they believed all of that was us
they can cover hardcore Henry we can't watch films live because they wanted to
talk about extending this podcast like we can't do that copy tisms yep can you
guys cover Jenny Nichols Trost review oh it's two hours though isn't it like I
don't think we can we can make it I don't really want to cover her again for
a while she's she's not very good at e-ball like it just after the ones we've
covered and and how like the format just lends itself to their rambling
essentially you might be like it's not the same for Quentin and all the others
and it's like yeah it kind of is I guess Quentin sometimes pulls in editing movie
Bob even if it was just considered rambling he still seems to use a script
I think thing yeah movie Bob definitely uses a script it's way too composed be
very amusing yeah he tries very much to keep up with Yahtzee in terms of how
fast he speaks which he can't if we ever covered Jenny Nichols again it'll
probably be Debbie Nichols will probably be a newer video than the Trost one I'd
pay to listen to mauler read grocery lists is he single slash ready to mingle
I suppose yes also hi everyone else shit out of here oh welcome the gay shit
welcome the gay shit don't mean to ignore y'all but baller heart very nice
of you okay I'm used to it demon Slayer looks like a promising anime sticking
close to the manga the author cried with joy watching episode 19 ending yeah I've
heard a lot of I've heard a lot of people critiquing that show is like the
main character just gets set up to be immediately just this unlikely hero like
is you meet his extremely shallow two-dimensional family and then they
all get fucking murdered in a terrible accident and that sets him up to be the
hero but I definitely intend on watching it I have all of it totally legally
downloaded on my Plex account and I will be getting to it in the near future
what's Plex Plex is like your own personalized Netflix server it's really
great for watching anime because so many anime have like a fucking billion
episodes and it'll remember which one you watched last and you can manually
toggle if you have like a dual audio anime so one that has like the subtitles
of the Japanese language or the English with occasional translation subtitles
for like signs and stuff then Plex lets you kind of swap between the two so it's
really neat it's totally free as long as you watch anything within your network
like in your house it's totally free but if you want you could like do remote
access for other people to enjoy but I couldn't really be bothered to fuck with
that Wow any new videos coming soon rags hopefully I've got one that's
really close to being done I was actually kind of hoping it to get it
done within a week or so but then I got sick struck with the ill I'm covering
soma for the second episode of my series where I pitch how I would adapt games to
films what do you think of trading the places of Sarah and Catherine to make
the ending more poignant trading the what do you mean like rating their names
which wouldn't make much of any difference what do you mean having the
character of Sarah be in in the device you hold Catherine's the one on the bed
oh I think they're trying to say that we meet Catherine at the end in a human
form rather than the scan be pretty effective I suppose maybe but how much
do you really want to change soma yeah I wouldn't want to change anything and I
do kind of like Catherine's finding out about what happened to Catherine if
without spoiling anything
the story that happens there so yeah I don't know I don't know that that's a
strict improvement for a film adaptation I don't think you need it but maybe you've
only been streaming for five hours yeah I know so short man today y'all's Duke
Newcomb fans not particularly right I guess when I was a kid yeah but not so
much these day originals are alright you should really get anomaly ink on for
the prequels efap after you rewatch I think he could give the best defense of
the prequel trilogy which would lead to a more in-depth and detailed discussion
I don't think he'd win but he'd do the best possible I rags hello we've already
got like because this came up before when this has been slowly mentioned
there's just a lot of people who are interested in being on that efap I'm not
sure what our roster even looks like already but talking about the prequels
slash talking about a cosmonaut video there we've got a couple of guests who
are interested and it's the kind of thing where you haven't gotten like
some guests only managed to finally get onto efap once the right video comes
along sort of thing so we shall see howdy mooper I wags hello
kick J of course of course he's been creep pre-kicked naturally I just showed
snowpiercer to my dad and brothers my brothers loved it my dad seemed unsure
what do you think of the film I remember thinking it was pretty awesome
if not a tad hard to believe like all of it if you know what I mean but I don't
know I had a lot of fun and it is definitely a sequel to Willy Wonka yep
if you've not seen it then dear Lord watch hardcore Henry yeah we keep getting
told to see hardcore Henry next on a list is still a uncut gems we're gonna
watch that yeah suggestion for efap 100 efap efap your dark descent versus
machine for pigs part one I watched it the other day and could see how much you
unironically evolved as a critic and video maker could be a fun time to watch
with guests high chase and rags and chat hello um yeah it's a neat idea but I
probably want to do that for some other episode because you have 100 think we
what everyone's gonna want is for us to be responding to all kinds of videos you
know to try and respond to that series I think it's in a is it two hours that
series like I don't know how much how well that'll do for pacing as well as a
sort of it's like a gimmick response in a way but yeah no I even I've seen parts
of my older stuff and I'm just like whoa there's so many things I don't do this
way anymore what video editing software do you guys use Sony Vegas 16 is what
I'm using I think I'm using 15 base what do you use I use Adobe Premiere Pro
2020 or whatever the fucking newest CC one is yeah who should replace wolf as
the third efap host well who why does there have to be three efap hosts yeah
I think free would be cool I'm just saying just because wait it's free but I
always for it yeah I think you always mentioned free he's black and then my
response is always wait really no he's green green it's so easy to fuck with me
format yeah we're we're all good with rotations and stuff just like today we
had the chase face you know how could we have him if we had three people here
already we wouldn't want him then yeah you gotta you gotta take me in then
small doses I think molar is a lot like James May but in your opinion which do
you think rags would be of the other two
I don't know if you fit the either of them really
I don't even know that I fit James May I don't know I don't I hmm
there's rags and Jeremy Clarkson what do they have in common yeah I don't know if
I'd be like Clarkson which I guess process of elimination leaves you with
one choice if I if I have to be James May
then I wonder who would be Clarkson I guess wolf would be Clarkson at that point
right yeah we'll probably be like Clarkson
someday there will be over 1.2 billion super chats to go through and molar
will die before reading them all I will not be defeated by super chance I'm not
because to my work pissed me off so much I basically told them to fuck off so my
boss gave me an air high-five for it huh it was a interesting boss you got
there because certain places I've been if I tried that I'd be in all of the
trouble high racks whoo-whoo hello how long will
ethap 100 be 48 hours break a record I'm not promising anything over 24 let's
just say that over 24 I'm sorry to interrupt really quickly I'm gonna go
now I gotta get a shower and then I'm gonna go see the sonic movie and expect
general mediocrity but um thank you for having me it's fun of course sir do you
want to talk a little bit about your channel before you head out yeah it's
probably gonna be kind of stagnant for a little while since I just got the audio
engineering job and that like fucking is every single day but uh yeah generally I
like to talk about video games and less these days about anime I'd care much
more about video games on my channel though if I see something really stand
out I'll cover it and yeah try to be critical and a little goofy and people
usually get mad at me and they take the the jokes as like very serious personal
attacks so that always makes the comment section pretty spicy but yeah
that's something you're into I made a video shitting all over the evil within
and it's very divisive so go go watch it maybe well thank you for coming on hope
you have some fun yeah I love you Chad even if even if your tastes are
completely contrary to mine it's all good homie anyway yeah molar rags hope
you have a good night and give my regards to free the black green man very
well shall do sure thing mr. J's
and then there was two the best to my right right the best to right the two
that are just touches to the rule of them all who did that earlier HH super
chat it wasn't me yeah yes oh wait there's they talk about the hardcore
Henry one I mean yeah oh well there's been three different accounts including
that one now that's done it apparently more people want us to see how cool
Henry they really want us to what every efap they tell us to see it gonna say
well we'll get to it eventually it's just I feel like it's not really that
requested you know there's not many people who are that interested in us
seeing it so it's not like a huge thing yeah it's fine play eros it's best
genre eros eros I don't know what that is what uh how do you spell it er og
I don't know what this means
Molly you need to see this I added you on Twitter a post by CBM cringe Oh eros
is a it's a Japanese genre of erotic video game okay yeah we can do that
who's CBM
oh right they're talking about the the Leroy Jenkins thing from Supergirl
yeah that looks horribly bad I can't believe they put that in an ad as if
like that'll get people to watch it I just I see it and I'm like what are they
kryptonite droids like why can't she do stuff supergirl not even once even
though we kind of saw her once with the crossover you know it's fine you guys
take your guys take on Ray's new golden lightsaber say that one more time sorry
raise new lightsaber what do you think of the colors fine oh I'm fine with
gold yellow you know I'm I like the color probably one of the last colors I
choose for my lightsaber but you know to each their own enjoy yeah I like it
rant about seasons two and three of stranger things I think I have on
different parts of efap but that's a that's a lot to get into I kind of need
to see them again because I could accidentally say some stuff that's very
inaccurate but I really hate season two and then season two is really funny bad the
season fours trailers come out I've heard so I should probably just check
that out at some point see if it'll be with me and Fortia watching the show
again just to laugh at it because I'm imagining season fours gonna be even
worse who knows please tell me you saw this supergirl Leroy Jenkins teaser tag
you in on Twitter yes I actually think Fringy showed us before we start
streaming so yeah terrible tisms it's not that requested challenge accepted
well it doesn't count if it comes from the same person you know apparently it's
pronounced arrow gay arrow gay of course I should have known and they said not
even kidding because they do that they we would find arrow gay arrow is gay
that's true
the year is 2024 every weekday is a 12-hour efap dedicated to rating anime
girls each weekend is one two hours of super check catch-up if a part three has
been redrafted 1.2 billion times after Disney sequel sequel trilogy George R. R.
Martin still hasn't put out winds of winter this is an accurate telling of
the potential future I'm not going to deny dude this is a corporation the
corporation operation sorry these rats are arranging a meeting with Scorsese
and probably paying him millions for dirt on him to get him to kneel to them
they are the psychos not us I
was one of the overflow ones I think it was because that video is getting people
rather heated in chat Cthulhu kind of forgot about the humans they're gonna
happen they're very small to him yeah he could though right because I thought the
whole point that humans were like so beneath his concern like cosmically
that we're just like nothing to him I don't know maybe yeah maybe I don't
know but I thought that's what it was well when money is involved it does
count mauler oh I see so if it's money it means it's another person it's
another rule like the voting twice thing no were you referring to the essay that
one guy typed under the video mauler is right about objectivity he sounded
actually insane it was disturbing I I'm not sure who that's referring to I'm
afraid this guy is literally editing out things to improve his argument and he
still thinks his position is right yeah it happens I'm not even sure what was
the thing that he edited out in that one there was I remember there being like a
big moment do you remember we we covered name Jonathan McIntosh's video and he
had the clip of Luke morning Han while he was like describing how good TLJ was
and it was like a fucking literally a deleted scene yeah you can't do that
cheating by the way daily reminders corsese was 100% right fuck sorry boys
they're referencing his take on Marvel movies yeah this is the last Jedi
defenders greatest hit compilation every bad take in one easy to listen to
collection yeah agreed it was originally bing bong instead of wing chong oh on the
Wikipedia both of those are very racist though still waiting for Jar Jar to
return well in I saw Jay's Lego rendition of his plans for making the
sequel trilogy story and he said he's bringing back Jar Jar and he said that
if you bring him back well people will actually like it and I think he's right
if someone's responding to diversity negatively fuck them I say this is a
Pashto Arab myself as a Pashto Arab myself somebody should ship a container
full of Somalis into Ryan's neighborhood and tell him to say that again
I'm back hello speaking of diversity here's yeah we got some green you were
green red and orange all put together nice balance mm-hmm I'm sure what are we
up to now overflow super chats ah TLJ fans have called me a misogynistic man
baby so many times at this point I'd argue sequel fans are worse than what
anyone from the prequels got agree I mean certainly with their ability to be
able to all people stuff like the prequels were before any proliferation on
the internet so when you have the power to fucking annoy people you start to do
it more at least that's my theory it's like you were only gonna hit them with a
club but then someone offered you a huge minigun you're like oh yes I'll use that
for some reason I was called homophobic for not liking TFA or TLJ I'm bi and
mostly date guys I've been called all sorts of things to consume guy consume
absolutely in rise of the Skywalker no revenge of the Sith sorry why gone
apparently has been one of the first to learn to become a force ghost this took
him 10 years now Han Solo can do it after one year no he was a memory very
yeah he was a force induced memory yeah not to be told force ghost yeah I was
about to say like it's not it's not that confusing holy shit he's been
sarcastic yeah I was fucking stupid I remember when he turned up I was like
wait wait he looks weird he doesn't look like a force ghost I mean he looks
normal so it's like what are they saying this is what are they arguing here and
according to those things he read earlier it was like they wanted it to be
that Leia was creating him we're like I mean I'm still not satisfied with that
explanation they just do whatever the fuck they want right like with the force
and just do anything mauler remember any engagement is harassment of course it's
true may this narrow never become h bomber guy 2.0 hey man he just enjoyed TLJ
leave him alone I don't know so with YouTube's new policy to become communist
China what's the plan for efap going forward well as we've said oh just you
know how to criticize other youtubers if efap not taken down for those
violating those community guidelines and it pretty much just the fap wouldn't be
able to exist in the form that it did on YouTube at that point it's worthwhile to
remember that any time that there's been like these policy like remember when
everybody thought copper was gonna destroy everything what if it's now it's
February and nothing happened yes because the implementation part of it
they just don't know what to fucking do but there's pretty a llama here YouTube's
over yeah we'll get another one pretty alarmist though like you know you got
what sound like get get liability insurance yeah I feel like there's been
15 of those in my time on YouTube in total yeah oh about YouTube is over yeah
yeah all different over the years making those videos where they like it's over
guys it's it's yeah it's kind of stupid maybe it will be one day and it's not
like YouTube hasn't been restricted over time it's just that it's still here you
know still go over yet this one just says I love tonaled good point it's fair
enough it feels good to see totaled again oh this is we can actually pinpoint
where we are now because this was the end of part one of wolf stream which
means the rest of these should be part two and then I should be caught up
oh my interesting that fire emblem one players choice at TGA for game of the
year but wasn't even nominated for the critics game of the year why do people
put stock in critics I don't know it's just this appeal to authority what I
will say is that like we do it with a lot of things like one quote experts
should have opinions that are more informed therefore we trust them more
but the thing with the media journalists and critics sometimes they
know less than us like an average fan well I mean part of it is like you know
what makes you an expert on film criticism right like I think the
easiest way to break it down would be like if arm if you if you went to you
know if a doctor gives you advice like that that means something because they
studied it for six years at university and have like a residency and then did
that but like a film critic what are your credentials you watch a lot of
movies so it's kind of hard to uh you know deferred to that at least you know
just on its own and it's the same for game critics with yes except game
critics like there is a certain qualification as in are you confident
enough to beat this game which is as in doubt now with certain journalists I was
gonna say Dean Takahashi but it wasn't gonna come out with a cough blessed
Southpaw for 2020 efap stream yeah approval I mean that's a whole year so
there's a good chance if Palpatine made Anakin then Ray is technically Luke's
cousin so Ray low is pretty much aunt nephew incest like Game of Thrones
mm-hmm but didn't they change that in their own canon or whatever I think they
have not sure I don't know cuz there I think they're aware of that vaguely and
they're like ooh let's let's avoid that heck cooked carrots I cannot agree more
on the cooked carrots question I know hi Rags hello did you ever get your
monthly thrust no I don't think I did I'll have to double-check nature's
marriage enhancements that will cook carrots on the marriage enhancements is
that because you can stick them into your holes your dingle dang yes it
sends tomorrow I don't know about that so here's the thing I can hate cooked
carrots huh guys carrots are orange orange food bad this is quality content
we need yes properly cooked carrots have never been tried oh my god the memes for
cook carrots I will go to bed now praise be raw ban Jay Heil rag Heil love you
wolf mauler Jesus man oh I know that reference Jesus man so here's the thing
I fucking hate cooked carrots another one and done differently but hey mauler
the carrot is Kevin from the Aldi ads I don't even remember the old yeah
but fair enough are you talking about Aldi the supermarket chain the what are
they originally are they German yeah they're German and they're here now too
and they have very weird ads that I don't understand I don't know if they
have cooked carrots they're all very strange
bringy I hope you've finished mr. robot and loved it I haven't finished season
four yet no I have been doing other things if not I hope you enjoy and love
the final season the the two season four twists add layers of new context to
virtually all scenes from episode one well yeah I've heard a lot of um things
about but I've I've heard the whispers of like the main thrust of the season
unfortunately because I've not done a great job of avoiding all that but yeah
that sounds cool I need to just sit down and watch it it is incredible the
amount of forward planning that took place oh I didn't realize it was still
going yeah Sam esmo is a genius is tonal the guitar musician yeah we
hit him playing it I kind of just you know we all wanted him to sing I think
but we just didn't get it unfortunately maybe one day though that'll be in a
monthly thrust tonal's guitar gets me so man wet man wet and wet
7-1-1 all right because of 7-11 but they actually did it in words this time all
of efap was worth it for that tonal video I mean it is a pretty good arc
don't lie everything in efap that led up to that tonal videos it was fantastic oh
my god we need tonal made efap jingle we could commission that maybe maybe 24
hour part one has ended laugh my ass off that one was only like 16 hours or
something 124 we should have expected long man to take long breaks I think
that means we're on the next one yo moolah when will next efap take place
you know I'm gonna treat that question as if it was asked now and that'll be
probably be next Saturday I'm able to organize whatever I'm able to organize
you know you never know also I mentioned inviting EVS I also recommended drunk
3PO and geeky candy it'll be lots of fun all possible we'll have to see I mean
certainly this stream and a lot of others we've had like a bazillion requests
for guests we were supposed to have one today didn't work out and you know that
that's how slowly we get through the guest list but hopefully we'll get there
came back for my Christmas party and you guys started a brand new efap classic man
classic also more slow now I love that cuz it's going well yeah that we're
nearly caught up to where it started that's why it's getting earlier and
earlier all right I see um there being well it's not I don't think these are
being read in reverse order they're reverse stream chronological order if
that makes sense I say yeah still though holy crap like yeah there's so
much how many how many more do you have left out of curiosity I it's really is
really I don't know how to estimate it but I think we might be able to get
through them this stream oh boy that sounds like it's gonna be a long time
still you hardiness is a symptom of the big gay about that so if anyone's late
to anything that means you have the big gay how much do you think Stuckman will
shill for nine I'm pretty sure he was not that kind to nine from memory I don't
think I ever saw do we see his video at any point I don't remember on nine what
what do you think that refers to for me the animated years years ago no
episode died oh right I don't know if he showed for it I think he I think he
wouldn't have given it as low as score as it probably should have gotten but
yeah he probably didn't show for it yeah I don't think he did I'm all it can you
hand this over to rags I can hey rags hey can you give a shout out to my
friend ice wallow come I'm sorry what it sounded like you said something
different oh I can repeat it a shout out to a person called ice wallow oh so this
person's name is ice wallow come I think so I ice wallow come huh it's all one
word it's almost like they want you to say it fast or something I'm not sure
no I want to make sure it's just an odd name I want to make sure mm-hmm it's
kind of funny how like you know I mean if you step in it up like that next thing
you know they'll be like oh can you give a shout out to I'm a stupid moron with
an ugly face and a big butt in my butt smells I like to kiss my head I always rely on you for deep
Simpsons references that's good shit my crotch I'm a stupid moron with an ugly face
what was another really good one um a man to hug and kiss that's a good one
homosexual yeah come on I'm looking for a man to hug and kiss and every time when he's
freaking out as well like with his I've got what was it Waylon Smith it's like if I find
you I'm gonna rip your eyes out and show him down your pants you can see me kick the crap
out of you I'll rip your head off and paint my house with your brains girl bow yeah also
hi wifey absolutely massive have a free super chat you masses I'll catch this one later while
working also high ranks ooh hello having seen this tonaled video he doesn't know what woke
means and assumes it means Star Wars is waking up again yeah it's great yeah so it is uh don't
see Rise of Skywalker see cats instead we'll see cats eventually that's gonna be movies it's supposed
to be it's supposed to be on yeah we're gonna eat fat movies and hopefully I don't know what should
I want to be for you fat movies cats who do you think needs to be in on that jeez so many options
we'll grab I don't know cuz we're doing drinker for um the knives out so we should probably
discount discount him uh who else could maybe Jay Longbone that could be pretty funny yeah yeah we'll
have to we'll have to look at our rosters figure it out um tonaled brings me so much joy oh my god
yes he does Kong wins a new Godzilla movie there was leaks I didn't think they would let I didn't
think they'd let either of them win like yeah isn't it also that seems like totally not how it would
happen Godzilla's super natural compared to Kong like I know they're both supernatural but Godzilla
fucking got god powers well Kong is a big ape you know also he's like nuclear he has that thing he
could blast people at a distance with his god breath what if Kong climbs down his throat and starts
ripping his insides apart how is he isn't aren't they meant to be the same size in this like new
thing in that case I guess Kong's gonna pick him up and throw him into space I don't know something
ridiculous okay no matter what this absurd Godzilla wins this fight no matter what I love how
that's probably gonna piss off some people they'll be like no Kong would win it right no way like
I like King Kong man but surely everybody agrees that like Godzilla is cooler than King Kong
like Godzilla's really be cool I mean I agree I think Godzilla's cooler yeah um
um first cousin once removed don't know what that's in reference to
does that sound familiar to what I've been talking about I'm not sure I don't I do not know I don't
know about that one uh goddamn YouTube and its stupid notifications I missed the prime time of
the toxic brood I'm so sorry hey guys it's me again I finally beat moonlight butterfly please
make fun of me no you beat it that's fine it was easy for you easy for you you did it and it was
fine all fine yeah you were so it's such an easy fight you were so bored he had to give us a super
chat mm-hmm now you have to watch young maestro's video on why Jedi fallen order is dark souls
yeah I mean it's pretty clear what the connections are at least I think it is
anyway yeah he must have spent a whole five minutes on that just wanted to say hello I'm
a big fan of mauler's channel I want to know if you're working on another unbridled rage video
currently thanks uh so I am currently in the audio recording section of my video but I've been
kind of trying out a different form of video making at this point um I told him people I think
on discord but right now I've recorded about a third of the audio and about half of that has
visuals and none of its music's done yet so still early stages of editing but I picture
it should take me about a month to get this one finished uh if I rush at least a portion of it
and by rush I don't mean skipping things I mean just spending a lot of time on it uh per day
it's probably gonna be three and a half hours that's my estimate right now could turn out to
be half an hour more or half an hour less right now I'm not 100 sure um depends on everything
and it's going to be tfa part three and then after that I'm hoping to start the joker praise
video I want to do so that's where I'm at with making videos um after the stream actually because
I woke up just before we started it well a couple of hours before but we uh I might do some recording
once we're done here get some get some more audiotisms but yeah it's on the way um how do
you not know 7-eleven I know taco belle for eg just from the us film tv etc and it doesn't
exist in my country just curious how you manage that I do know I've heard of 7-eleven at least
I think I know it now in wales no I think he means that not the numbers themselves uh but uh
yes 7-eleven you need the chain gas station place yeah they don't crop up in that much media 7-eleven
compared to something like walmart or even taco belle I feel like I've seen taco belle a lot more
than I've seen 7-eleven but uh I feel like I have too I feel like I've seen 7-eleven more than
taco belle but yeah maybe they do it differently you know in upside down mind well I mean I know
that I mean we got 7-elevens in Australia in certain places we don't have them over here
yeah anything but that anything but not having 7-eleven I mean we need all of the things okay
I need all variety well yeah I do agree like because when it comes to fast food here you are
starved for choice but no really there's like nothing there's mcdonald's
kfc like hungry jacks and that's that's basically it and subway yeah we we don't have wendy's we
don't have arby's we don't have denny's we don't have IHOP we don't have taco belle or chipotle or
anything like that would be yeah uh we have a zambrero yeah zambreros oh my god zambrero
they're like well yeah they're like hat materials you shouldn't eat that oh really uh tell me what
to do I just did can't stick around to cash stream live unfortunately just wanted to say
I wish you all the best uh wolf also high rags hello once again donald has some legitimately
good takes mm-hmm it'll be interesting to get to the because soon these little superchats will
start reacting to the uh the rr debate that happened with shad oh my god greetings gentlemen
high rags hello I made a dawn film using the ideas you came up with on efap 36 it's on youtube as
oh my god this guy said we read this one today as well but this is in my backlog from ages ago
oh my god sorry that we only just got to it the moment you decided to reset the mess
oh my gosh yeah I'm gonna uh I've got it noted I will check out what it is yeah we will watch it
we will watch it uh oh my god tonaled is digivolving as a critic hmm I'm a long way
uh this says rope me daddy tonaled uwu I'm scared what do I do with that
do you follow your heart all right we're taking the hobbits together legboat bagolas
I get it I get it
uh we he didn't even ask for the claps either oh yeah tonal did not ask for claps and yet he got them
um tonaled has more of an arc than ray has now most characters have more of an arc than ray does
I mean it's not hard to you know beat her out in that way sonic the hedgehog had more of an arc
and sonic the hedgehog than she did oh my god I'm not even kidding like again it's not hard she
doesn't really what would even be her arc does she have one I don't know I don't know who my parents
are but I guess I do now spends the whole trilogy getting different answers to who her parents are
and the entire time they forgot to give her a character like you know when she finally
discovers that she can just pick her own name or whatever that feels like the beginning of her
developing like finally she can start figuring out who she is and it's like oh that's it
oh
sorry to keep bugging you with dark souls but our attunement intelligence and faith any use for a
sword slash shield user yes but it depends on the like infused infused what is what's infused in
your sword and what um if your sword scales it just depends on what sword you've got or what weapons
you've got with uh those things in particular intelligence is just for uh sorcery stuff though
right I have to re re-poop all of my dark souls knowledge but um either play it either play it
blind or decide that you are going to search up these things to best optimize and then check the
uh the wikis and stuff because um they will know a lot more than I will for sure um
um okay that was amazing keep being dangerous efappers hi massive it's nice to see the trio
um nice to see you too also check this out got a uh url here do you want to um
either if either of you are free just check that url see what it is they wanted us to have a look
see um ever hero it doesn't look like a real url well no you've got it you know how to make that
a real url right all right I guess so like they can't put a they can't put a link in a super chat
as far as I know that's why it's like that it's called a long long man song the long long man
song yeah you want to um link it as the actual video and then I'll uh yeah I'll put it in my
things to check out a little later election all right oh that one they've already made um
a couple memes about that sort of thing right one of them made it into my tfa part two I think
I'm gonna refill my drink and be right back all right ever heard of the come town podcast
no have you heard of that no no idea what that is yeah no idea um medallion versus jebeditor
hmm I'm gonna vote jebeditor
that is my opinion I don't need Brie Larson to tell me what worked about Medea it wasn't made for him
yeah have you seen batman beyond oh yeah go ahead uh not uh nothing really uh have you seen batman
beyond return of the joker no neither by tfa show jedi can sense lightsabers and fallen order has
them overwhelmed with emotion what about luke with anakin's what about obi-wan on moustafa
I don't know man like dude at this point there's no point in even trying to understand
how anything works in star wars anymore they've ruined it
the only option they have is decanonizing stuff again the rodent stuff this time I don't know
that they do that yeah I don't think so because you'd have to admit that you've made a mistake
and that doesn't look good no they don't like doing that I don't think um still waiting for
mauler's game of thrones finale rage that will enter my queue at some point I will want to do that
lots of projects
um boom boom boom film Roberto's final form droideka diabetes hey I mean if you're on the move you
know not bad uh is jay's culture war the reason he killed Epstein it all makes sense now
he hasn't denied it if you remember just just put it out there I will say that to him the next time
he appears on this poured course a bit unrelated but what do you think of the new republic in the
mandalorian just destroying a whole space station of probably mostly innocent people
nah mandalorian's great it's pretty stupid yeah it was horrifying like unironically
because I first watched that episode with you at battle right it was b u bell and I think so
it was just like it did maybe rags rags was watched it after we had I think I watched it
again with them I think we're in disbelief yeah I'm just blown away but they just destroy it all
it's insane uh guys what's your favorite movie of the 2010s oh dude I don't know that's tough
2010s as a whole it's just like um I need to really revise a list there would be a lot of options
I think I'm not comfortable giving an answer either it's yeah I haven't even got suggestions
because I the second I suggest one I'd be like well there's another 10 I need to mention
yeah yeah exactly that's a tough question I feel like I've made a big list in front of me um
like a big list of all the films and even then like I can't pick one
Kathleen Kennedy said it's hard to make Star Wars with no source material so I want to do a
reven Revan series about how easy it is the old republic episode one the new order episode two
the Jedi crusaders and episode three war of the Jedi I mean yeah you know give it a shot can't be
worse than what they did right um just says I guess I'm not sleeping now
up to you I don't know just sleep while listening to you fab I've heard people have done it
glad I could be here to witness these incredible meme videos on a trip down memory lane with the
efap crew and the toxic brood slice and dice brothers oh yes yeah we had some uh some really
awesome memes today as well as that stream months ago uh the link to the last video isn't working
for me it was awesome got a little teary-eyed oh right yeah yeah you can definitely find it though
the um the name of it was in the top left if you just uh youtube that you could find it
diabeto's sidekick splendor man I get it the splendor isn't splendor a sweetener
it is an artificial sweetener um splenda is an artificial sweetener the efap lore whole would
be wider efap lore whole is wide I think is the point of that yeah that's a big lore whole
it's it's that ninja psycho mantis I don't know what that's referencing what
ah well psycho mantis is um metal guest yeah metal guest solid no I mean what it's referencing
what we would be covering oh I don't know maybe art like maybe someone made art of you and it
kind of looked like psycho mantis yeah actually a gas mask might be okay because we I remember
us looking at a meme of a screenshot of uh psycho mantis so that might be it yeah and people were
like it's mutually maybe what rags has long hair I remember 2017 rags
did you have short hair in 2017 is that what they mean yeah I used to have short hair
I used to have short hair and I would um I'd let it get a little bit like it was still like
short but I'd let it grow out a little bit and I would use hair you know stuff to make it look
really nice it looked pretty good but uh just let it grow long and it's long to this day
your hair is a long man oh my hair is my hair is very long my hair is like yms long
um it look good a black emo is a nemo think about it oh my god oh my goodness
that's um that's a sexism in some way wow that is can we get a straw poll of how many efap fans
will or will not be seeing ros personally I really want to see it be in the conversation here
uh but I can only vote with my wallet so I've decided not to
well I think most well do you think most saw it or didn't see it I think that a number that would
surprise you didn't see it that's what I'm gonna say and like considering how many people are
talking about it I would be I think a number of people didn't see it but just assumed it was bad
based off of what was said about it online which is fine it's piece of shit movie but you know
uh rags I caught yampa in pokemon sword and named it and I'm rags yampa yeah y-a-m-p-e-r
it must be a dog pokemon oh it is a dog pokemon is it oh I was just sort of taking a stab at the dog
uh here it is
it's a cute
that is a cute doggo what does it evolve into
who knows are you gonna show any more memes big sexy but like I said
copyrightism memes me and rags will probably knock out at some point
no rush because they collect up more and more so it's just like more to knock out in one go
and we might do some more image memes if uh if we have the the time for it
if they're not covered they will eventually because oh that's the evolution nice yeah
so bolt bolt end all right so it's electricity pokemon oh of course it's got a freaking bolt
for its handle that's pokemon character design right there listen it's very subtle also yeah I
can copy and paste images that have transparent backgrounds and they actually show the transparency
of the background didn't you know that well it didn't used to be like that yeah did it I thought
it's definitely yeah I thought it was for a long time it goes far saying it's been like
more than years that it's been doing that I don't know it feels like it's new to me
I guess you're just not posting as many uh yeah like transparent images maybe I guess not I couldn't
just seem new to me oh well oh it was exciting while it lasted we should you know it is new
and it's awesome woohoo there we go um I could be miss meringue when it came out but I'm pretty
sure it's been out for a while that's been doing that feels old uh I only saw ros for efap not
gonna happen again just to be in on the conversation I mean the way we covered it over that like
maxed out stream was that you didn't need to see it we we like explained all of the scenes
but yeah you know it's always nice to be able to understand it fully uh eric would actually make
a good golem if you've heard the singing at the start of his inbred take on rags you could
believe he hides in caves all day oh my goodness that's very offensive uh if you do an episode nine
poll make sure to put in an option for non-paying viewers my brother gets free tickets through his
works uh oh okay that makes some sense yeah if you've seen it for free you might be more inclined
also goodbye wolf we love you would knobs even be able to pronounce half of the words in the memes
yeah maybe he says wids done that I've heard it knobs and also hell yeah wolf like has been hotel
they don't know what he would have done to make them reference that
or said the mando is aquaman in space without the water
it's supposed to look more like rock rough aquaman in space without the water
um i feel like that misses the point but it evolves into lichen rock
where would you be if you didn't do all of the things you didn't want to do this is how you get
rape what what well i hope we don't get rape or i hope we do get rape so now it's not rape anymore
and they followed up with laugh my ass off didn't know rags was a hollywood producer
oh yeah not not sure f for this conversation right there's an argument to be made that
i wasn't a stormtrooper just means i was a specialist non-rank and file
oh in reference to the um to bill burr implying the stormtroopers car name well it was him telling
somebody else that because he knew that other people would understand what he means and it
would be accepted as fact yeah and he was offended at the idea that someone might assume
he might have been a stormtrooper because of their bad aim yeah he wanted to quell that immediately
which yeah it's real funny real real funny but hilarious maiming it up uh episode three of mando
was overrated fight me it is overrated a lot of people say it's one of the best episodes most of
it's overrated at this point if not all of it except episode four most people seem to agree
episode four is a disaster so i know a lot of people think no agree that episode five is really
bad too so i guess those two are sufficiently rated uh decisions like this are why efap is 11
hours i'm again not 100 sure what we did there but it would make sense yeah we went for lengthy
amounts of time or he just joined game pass so far it's really great that's good enjoy or he too
will be out soon enough um any chance you'll do an updated endgame thoughts for efap i mean we kind of
talk about it every once in a while here on efap anyway right like we every once in a while it
comes up we're not very we don't talk about it very favorably uh our best thoughts about it usually
based on things that are very subjective or shaky like how much we just like these people and we
wanted to see them commit to certain actions in certain scenarios but a lot of them are
really not set up or justified in any logical way a lot of it's just nonsense but you know
um i doubt we do a whole episode or somebody's saying lillip up lillip
oh that's kind of cute oh yeah rags look up lillip up that could be you just implied it's
possible to understand riser skywalker kind of here's some of it i mean it's not like
crisis on infinitisms where it's just incomprehensible
we saw a clip before the stream started guys of um oh no well i mean yeah uh you gotta you gotta
scroll all the way back to find it but uh oh yeah people have uh been super sad about it i've been
talking about it oh i know lee roe yeah lee roe jenkins i mean like and he can't even do the
delivery right he's doing it and his voice is cracking i wonder how many times did it take for
that i do too what do you what do you want to bet they did a second one and they're like all
right that's good enough we gotta you know these shows have made in like four days the person
directing it didn't even like know the meme and was just like yeah that's that's it i guess that
that's your script yeah the writer said i needed to do this so yeah well i mean yeah it's like a 13
year old meme hey you all want your objective opinion on these tv shows bird notice i've not
seen that uh i've heard of it i know i've seen it a couple of times it's the one where it's like
when you're burned you got nothing and that that's all i know about that show okay it's
about a spider who like yeah uh i've heard that that show's good i watched the first few episodes
i didn't like it at all okay visually it was cool conceptually it was cool the writing was
annoying me a lot right um like the idea that the old gods are like all these different
idols of worship and uh different things and then the new gods are like
rugs media and all these other things represented by individuals like there's something there to
work with i just didn't like their execution that much but uh visually very striking and uh
eden mcshane's in it so that's a plus and he's really cool well he was in hellboy though and
i hear nothing but bad things wow but then again all i hear is that he's the good part of that movie
uh highlander tv show i didn't watch that never heard of it uh oh and rag seen it
sorry i have heard of it but i've never seen it and rags all wheat grana neat ninnibon
ninnibon are the champions
i don't know i have four pints of ciders two ounces of whiskey and a stella before watching
tross this was a good choice i agree could help hopefully uh will you ever do an in-depth review
of lost i love it and would love to see you tell me why i'm wrong um i'm not gonna touch lost
i'd have to get into it again and i don't imagine i would want to
this two seasons were pretty awesome rest of it was pretty poopy until it got really really poopy
and then uh depending on who you talk to the ending was the worst thing in the world
or it made loads of sense and it was great but i was definitely in the former camp
this time travel in that show by the way oh that's gonna go great i would imagine so it always goes
great time travel works every time we know this yep it always gets nailed that's why people do
it so much because it's so easy to do yeah i mean it's not like it's incredibly conceptually
challenging concept i want to point this out this is the first defab i've been present for
and it's truly been a treat is it wrong to molest baby yogurt i mean he's like 50 i think
let me baby yoda asking for a friend don't forget to consume disney product yes it's wrong it would
be based on its ability to consent essentially in an informed way so even though it's over our age
of consent our age of consent is that way because we have to pick a place average biology of humans
not yodas yeah and yodas would be significantly younger which would be really tough for a pedophile
who sees a really hot baby and is like man in 60 years i'm gonna fuck this shit did rags just say
he wants to fuck the chat oh rags what do you think i've seen some pretty uh sexy chat before
i could i think i could be persuaded oh uh long man do you watch qi i used to watch it all the
time i haven't watched it in a long time though but that's one of them awesome panel shows
uh yeah the you you discover a lot of things on qi that are like oh my god i didn't know that
right that's the best reason to watch jeb isn't his name game over man game over oh yeah that's when
we learned that it was john ellis bush is his name not jeb which is his name i agree jeb is his name
jeb is his name jeb why is he why would he call himself jeb if his name is john
because john's name and it's probably his family name because jeb is a powerful name
jeb is short for jebadiah right or jebathy jebathy please clap
woohoo yeah what they probably thought it was endearing and personable you know yeah and look
at how that works out poor jebathy jeb bush bush down with john ellis bush jeb the false prophet
to be fair it is common for special forces to rag on the marksmanship of common grunts
not unlike calling each other massives that wasn't it though that wasn't it yeah
and uh we can't even this argument sucks now anyway because of uh episode seven or eight
sorry where they literally can't shoot properly and they're like lol uh i thought his name was
jebadiah but it turns out it's so much worse yes name is just jeb um this just says my mum would be ass
okay i thought his name was jebadiah my initials would be jackal jcl yeah that's kind of cool
yeah that's good oh this is when we're talking about um the initials uh what what name gets
created so i guess that guy was saying his mum's would be ass i guess her name starts with an a and
then she got ss for the middle and end and mine was cunty president cunty for p.m i'm a political
science major and i didn't know jeb was named john with the actual flick fuck i didn't know existed
until 2016 yeah no most people didn't know he existed until 2016 we tried to erase it from
history huh jeb is evolving congratulations jeb evolved into bush bush bush bush lind cunty
bush bush cunty you're now an honorary australianism i give you the g'day pass
g'day g'day see you next tuesday efap gang gang water is wet henlo ragazizzes
hello and geode
mauler aka clancy nte
look up man after man for context on the sessions greetings meme
we'll put that in my notaruz
why do you have four names cunty i don't know two middle names a lot of people have two middle names
totally normal well no no if you have four names you can't have a middle name
what are you talking about oh uh i suppose that makes sense
why can't you have two middle names well his logic would be that there is technically no middle
if he has the ones too far to the left one's too far to the right one's too far to the left
one's too far to the right much like our podcast simultaneously both too far to the left and too
oh i see what you did there very very excellent isms only one uh nevada by the way
oh the final results in no like it's been called as the projected winner at this point
like it's basically over careful for any chat might stop shouting at you to wait again
yeah but i mean i was right the first time like they were already calling it when i would
set it before you're all gonna get pissed for your rod rod yeah it's all right i'm not i'm not
saying anything about i'm just saying that's the results yeah i know i gotta run batman arkham
games ranked i loved asylum i liked city slightly more than asylum i think and that's the only two
i played i played origins origins was fine um but i didn't play night because no batman batman
yeah arkham series i didn't play night um i wanted to but the launch was
really bad on pc and also the pre-order bonus of what's insufferable
23 reporting everybody shit about you again free i'm so sorry yeah but what does that mean
like if the if the somebody's already come out and said yeah i win like isn't that isn't that
just how it works i mean i think you're all you're trying to say is that it looks like booty's
with it you don't know projected yeah and they're basically calling it everybody's like yeah
projected interesting the uh av clover shell just is behind styer but again it's only 23
yeah at least at the start uh can you guys efap the captain marvel xxx parody again we were
thinking about it i don't know i don't think we could do that at efap video because the cover
would be odd and full opacity for most of it probably well you could keep the audio but it
could just be like an xxx version of the efap logo and we could be describing in detail what's
happening i don't know if i want to do that that'll be weird as fuck so little substance
certain scenes we just have to be describing of actions like well this is well shot they're just
just going at it uh master so fine he makes slavery say damn make slaves say damn okay
um
see this one's from ages ago and yet it came up on this podcast so we've got another coenky dink
this one says holy shit molar is 6-4 i'm as long as the long man what are the odds of that wow
oh it's cray cray that is very cray cray uh am i wrong for considering the star wars prequels
to be far worse than the sequels ps i despise them both you're wrong yeah i would say it's
pretty staggering how bad the prequels sequels are compared to the prequels like it's the prequels
aren't good um i think episode three maybe you can make the case but yeah like compared to the
sequels oh boy the amount of time it takes to explain everything that's wrong with the sequels
out does the prequels by a long shot yeah uh the season's greetings meme is from a book called
after man i highly recommend it if you guys are into some nightmare fuel
uh thoughts on what we should do about censorship in gaming also any games you're looking forward
to playing this year uh what do you mean by sense well that's a stupid question i can that can't
answer i don't know what they mean what do you mean oh actually yeah you can you just sent that
in what do you mean by censorship like specifically uh well they sent oh yeah they sent that recently
i guess they could probably uh yeah um and also games looking forward to animal crossing and doing
one the same day cyberpunk or um yeah or is another one um and that's the main the main stuff
fighter fantasy seven remake looks kind of cool but i never really played the first one so
yeah i mean the first one the original yeah
uh not the point where it's almost like i look forward to updates to games i already like more
than new games uh yeah to some extent yeah hi i made the bob chamber meme i smudged rags
i smudged uh rags is right i don't even know what this is regarding it just says rags is right i
think you're okay yeah hi rags but uh oh hello uh but the last person asked about what we should
do about censorship in gaming um either don't don't buy the games if they use censorship or
uh assist with distribution of anti-censorship measures like mods or original versions that
you could find yeah i guess i don't know what form of censorship is something i'd even be okay
with the less the better usually with media yeah um so just just putting that across nothing fancy
you know nothing crazy just you know kind of what you do with other bad products
and uh it followed up with i use coral paint shop pro i don't know what exactly but yeah
oh and they followed up with uh i mean companies deliberately changing content because of sjw hate
mobs oh um yeah okay okay um do you mean like after the fact or do you mean like while they're
making the game that's something they're thinking about and then they i don't know i guess um
censorship to me means like an outside influence coming along and saying no as opposed to yeah
we're talking about the concept of censorship like the principle of it not just you have to
be the government is that what we're talking oh sorry what what i meant by outside was somebody
who wasn't directly involved with the creation of it so yeah we like send this to the publisher as
well um anybody outside of the development studio yeah but if someone was i don't know making the
game and they originally had a bunch of dialogue in it and then they were like actually i think
it's too harsh i'm taking it out i don't upset some people at that point it's just like yeah
might as well be censorship um i don't know about that like someone deciding they didn't want to
they want to change their work because they don't like they didn't realize previously how
much it might offend a person it's like it's up to them at that point surely uh well what what if
it's like i don't want to get in shit for this the song taking it out that's essentially self-imposed
censorship and that's just on them right yeah but that's what that's uh sorry i thought that's what
you meant um i mean i'm not a fan of that but i wouldn't also want to be like no you can't do
that because it's like that's just the the opposite end right it's like forcing them to do something
they don't want to do so yeah i agree but i agree with the publishers or companies or whatever being
like no don't do that is is a is a go away-tism but that happens fucking all the time all over
industries right yes rags finds himself by looking down between his legs
say what i don't know it just says rags finds himself by looking down between his legs i don't
know what that's supposed to mean um i don't know what that means find yourself that way all right
find myself uh so happy you like my videos efap is the best hugs to molar and rags and a super big
hug to wolf you're the spark of my inspiration for those videos glad you're leaving but i understand
and please take care and water your gems unfortunately i don't know which videos that
one was referring to but um yeah we had loads of really great ones in that selection and and today's
molly have you ever been to the us and rags have you ever been to the uk i have not i have not
i was there were really interesting answers i don't know what else to do with that it's just
like it's simple bid to list places in europe but i haven't actually been to the america's
maybe one day though
yeah well women are gay what about that molar oh
i don't know what i can say about that women all women are gay probably you'd have to ask me
um molar are your gaming streams archived so all the times i've played games have all been put
into wattos junkyard in my discord little channel it's just filled with all streams where i play
games if you wanted to find them this is a weird selection in there holy shit molar is six four
oh wait i read that one uh dutch here six four almost five definitely the water
oh there's apparently something in dutch water that makes them tall all right
i'm 188 centimeters barefoot and i feel like the shortest guy in my family
you must be in a family of giants fairly tall people in that case yeah
good night masses i'll catch up with the rest of this rerun sadly
uh take but take care uh goodbye wolf hello rags and long live efap
uh and wolf it's legend okay uh don't know pokemon theme i'm actually offended
wait who didn't know the pokemon theme that'd be embarrassing someone didn't i forget who it was
though i doubt it was me because like i know that shit really well yeah i mean i meme it a lot right
like wanna be you couldn't you can you can do whatever you want with it is my point
uh atlas is cutting content from their persona 5 remake due to complaints about
two of the characters being gay sorry for banging on about uh what complaints about characters being
gay yeah that's wow okay it's pretty dumb oh apparently it was j that makes a lot of sense
oh of course uh don't worry mauler i watched both as well oh i think i might have been talking about
pokemon or digimon or something sounds familiar and a lot of people were like what the fuck i
didn't seem digimon i was like oh really people are okay well i mean i never really liked digimon
but yeah i just remember when it came out that it was i was just like this won't do as well as
pokemon it's not gonna happen sorry it's too late rags don't feel so bad destiny took a photo with
a five foot three woman and he's the same height okay is he only five foot three yeah he's yeah
he's very short well uh he's also a cuckold which is kind of worse than anything you could be
i mean i could be a rapist but at least you'd believe in what you do right rags
oh god i forgot about that oh man yeah um yeah i think we were talking about uh themes
just like actual soundtracks and stuff find each other and this person said uh power rangers beats
them all uh what the original one i assume so i don't really know uh molly your drunken argument
for why mandalorian was bad was more convincing than the 10 hour efap law i now agree with you
so they're referring to the super chat catch-up three where we open when i've had lost a drink
we're talking about mandalorian and i think yeah i was planning on making this argument at the end
of our coverage of mandalorian which may still happen it's just once shad is uh back up and run
in fully yeah um basically i think it's like addressing what the point and plot of all of it
was and how it doesn't make sense at the core and then going through how all of the main characters
make a lot of stupid decisions to make a lot of things happen the fobs being one of the most
significant parts to the wheel building is is fucking nonsense if you try to figure it out
like a lot of these broader parts to why everything falls apart and then i guess
individual little things throughout um anyone uh anyone able to knock out that guy in chat
there you go look how much they fucking absorbed in chat it was spam spam person spam person spam
person spam person spam spam spam it's just like that was all the same person too or same box
um but yeah the mandalorian will get a second stream one day and uh hopefully it'll be a
little bit more streamlined because we're dealing with the last three episodes which are
just so easy to tear apart um kind of like episode four which went pretty smoothly if
i remember compared to the old anyway uh reset era have been threatening to dox atlas employees
and have been harassing the guy who runs the persona team for years so they changed the english
localization for persona five that's terrible yeah wow yeah i know like if you want to make
something these days just stay underground don't let anyone know your name
um go go power
best thing ever i don't know about that you think it beats pokemon
uh i don't know i don't uh pokemon's pretty legendary power rangers in space
power rangers spd one was okay kind of
yeah it was power rangers in space yeah they had a really good theme song
what's your rating for sonic my uh ironic score is seven out of ten but it's unironically a two
out of ten if you haven't seen it kick j it's not it's not a two out of ten um i mean i wouldn't
give it anything higher than a five probably more like a four but two yeah i'm not feeling that
um and ironic i'm not sure if it has much ironic value actually for me it would have if it was
still ugly sonic but because it looks good now it's like yeah it's just just a normal kind of
not great movie neither of you have seen it yet right no no uh so no you don't need to
uh you guys ever get to the bottom of starship troopers if they were sociopaths or not
no the the floor they highlighted was that they're not sociopaths yeah make of that what you will
uh actual last one have you considered dave cullen or computer forever computing forever
as a guest been watching his channel for a while and seems like a natural fit you could
cover the irish martial arts film of fatal derivation deviation uh which is the room
like charm oh not against it i have not seen much of his stuff but that's maybe um
didn't he uh that's probably like more controversial topic go ahead bring it up
oh yeah i don't know whatever it was going to be yeah you probably should google these things
before we just let go is this the guy that blah blah blah is like oh all right it was um it was
the video yeah no i'll just i don't want to i don't want it to be big like arguments
with shadow or anything uh when you get around to reading this happy 2025 also what do you think of
half life three i get it i read that on the moment it was posted express delivery uh what
are your favorite and least favorite nolan films interstellar and prestige uh yes i would say
prestige now too because maula made me watch it and i enjoyed it thoroughly yeah but interstellar
oh fucking hey interstellar but you know what dark night rises like i still don't like that
quite a bit pretty close contender i would say dark night rises yeah
uh you got any different ideas on that one rags the least favorite
um i haven't seen dark night rises all right well that's pretty bad one yeah yeah um but
interstellar is like oh interstellar's got some really bad tisms how about how about we expand
and rank it uh from best to worst all of them
i guess we need to figure out what we're including and then we can do it because uh how about we
just go from batman begins onward so excluding memento and the one that came before it because
i haven't seen those so a lot of a lot of people say that batman begins as the best of the trilogy
and i'm always like isn't it dark night and then i'm like maybe i need to rewatch them both and pay
close attention to figure out which actually might be stronger but i know rises is the worst of the
three yes um then inception is thrown into this right yep yep uh damn this is the problem i need
to see a lot of these again that's good uh well i mean if i were to do it it would be interstellar
right at the bottom um and then the dark night he didn't make manasteel that was zach snider
oh yeah he was a producer um so yeah i'd start interstellar at the bottom then the dark night
rises second last then done kirk um then inception then batman begins then the dark night and then
the prestige noting that the those three the ones so prestige uh dark night and batman begins a
lot higher for me than the ones that came afterwards i subjectively like inception a lot
like on a on a that level i i like inception a lot but yeah i feel like it's not gonna hold up very
strong well yeah there you go i mostly agree with that or at least i would tacitly like i'd need to
look into more of the films again to be able to know any different uh any books you would recommend
uh what any book in general this is the thing that's a that's the kind of thing that you could
answer for a long time uh maybe we can go one each or something that's an 84 then that's what
i'd recommend how about you ranks say that one more time what's a book you would recommend
uh the alchemist i would also recommend uh the count of money cristo that's my favorite
i would say the stand is really good do one i enjoy if you like when you're
science fiction recommend the foundation novels as mob did as oh hammer of god's another really
good one as is nightfall uh of course lord of the rings and the hobbit really really good
let me see um lords of discipline man we just highly did one and you've got like 15
oh i was just thinking about lots of books yeah that's good stuff
i'll throw in lemony snicket series for me just a nice and easy reading quick quick ish
stories compared to the larger books we probably mentioned here and if you want oh actually i got
one that might be cool um this is an australian book series it was called like the just serious
so like just crazy just stupid it's uh by an author called andy griffith's illustrated by
terry denton i think um that's kid's book but um i really enjoyed it as a kid it's funny i guess
while it's on my mind uh i would highly recommend the first three halo books oh yeah full of the
flood and first strike in that order they are really excellent they're very everything that
comes after would not so much yeah i don't know about any of the other stuff but the first three
i got a box set of the three of them they are really good i uh i would highly recommend them
especially the flood uh but they're all all three of them are very very good books like
that show how good the halo universe really is yes before they ruined it yeah uh i'm trying to
think of any quick ones off the top of my head that might be especially short ones um i would
my men that's a short one uh on the subject of halo books the novella um
ah damn it it was the was it the shadow of intent that was the ship from halo
yeah i think it's uh novella shadow of intent written by joe state and the original writer
for like halo one two and three that's a really good recent halo book yeah the halo graphic novel
was good too um i haven't read that yeah it's good they i got i got actually back here on my
silent storm is okay as well someone in chat just messing that silent storm is all right
um second sunrise over new mom bass is great uh i think the best one in there is um
last voyage of the infinite sucker really really good
the names of all the ships in halo awesome yeah we'll save the galaxy that's a good one
wait does all the names of the sucka and yeah s-u-c-c-o-r means help like our assistance
so have you ever heard the term suckerless i mean it's basically helpless no i haven't interesting
no uh i'm trying to think of like some other books that i've read that just like stand out
it's weird because i haven't thought about reading in a while because i don't read anymore
uh reading is gay it just takes a long it takes a long time and i just get engaged more by other
things uh and it's not very social you know it's not like you can read and do other stuff
you can't really multitask i will admit it's cool that i can watch new films with people
and i don't lose out compared to watching on my own while with a book it's very much an isolated
event usually yeah it is and some people like that about it but i actually don't um i like to
be able to watch movies with people i like to be able to play games with people or just talk with
people while i play games you know books are something you have to devote yourself to they
kind of they demand your attention in time uh i would say yeah books books are entire you know
films can be enjoyed passively uh tv shows music can be enjoyed passively video games are sort of
in the middle i think um you can take it whichever way you want like ie you can really focus in or
you could play it while listening to a podcast or something whereas books are like 100 attention
i guess you can't really do anything else people probably argue audiobooks can be done
like you could listen to it oh yes i think audio books we trade audio books differently i would
say is a meat like that they're books but yeah the way in which you engage with it is different i
think audiobooks have a lot of value um yeah but audiobooks are like 15 to you know 30 hours long
potentially so yeah all right uh clarification those two gay characters in persona five that
are being censored were portrayed as being predatory is so that's the issue they took with
it i guess well it wouldn't matter at that point would it because it's it's just i know you can't
portray gay people it's like bad they would be in any way they can't have any well if you remember
it chapter two opens with a character getting killed and the character was gay and people
were upset about that it's like okay they're like pennywise betrayed us it's like you people are
crazy anyways doesn't care if you gay or straight you'll fucking eat you it doesn't matter
but okay tastes like dick uh what are your thoughts on the warcraft movie as a movie and
also a video game it's pretty bad it's pretty bad i have not seen it i've not seen it you don't
need to it's it's it's pretty bad i know a lot of people say it's good but it's it's not like it
i we we often bemoan people for saying the pacing is bad but my god the pacing in the
warcraft movie is kind of atrocious when i was um i was in vegas and we were at um
let's see i think it was i forget um i think we're at the they have come to me in a moment
but we were down on the the hotel we were staying at and when i was down there i had a i actually
had a i have a shirt that has the horde symbol on it i don't know why i have it i just had it i
seriously don't even know how i have it but i was walking around the floor and i had this on it and
some dude comes up to meet mirage it was a mirage i think no it's not there am i um but he was like
oh dude you like world of warcraft i'm like oh i mean before i could even finish he's like dude
the movie is so great man i don't know if you've seen it but if you haven't you need to go see it
it is so good i think you'll really really love it like oh you you bet oh i think it was at the
mgm grand is where it works yeah but uh this is some guy who's talking about how great it was
it's not yeah i haven't seen it but i i've not had any urge to watch that ever i was just like
maybe a ton of money though i i gotta imagine that if you like warcraft it's probably really
cool to see uh like it's super accurate when it comes to the designs of the armor and the
world and all that and the orcs are really impressive in terms of visual effects
do they never make a sequel to it if it did well uh it didn't do well domestically it did really
well in china but it didn't do well in the united states which is part of the reason why i don't
think they've uh looked at yeah following it up yeah it looks like the rotten tomatoes for
audiences is 76 and that's low considering this is the kind of movie that you would expect it's
almost like a christian movie in a way where you sort of expect the people who go out and see it
are no they know what they want and what they're going to get out of it and so they'd rate it
highly you know yeah yeah i think i agree with that um i know that there was some talk about
because uh like i remember i watched a video i think it was um uh i'm having a brain fart
cinema sins um and they were just constantly tearing into like world of warcraft while they
making their you know everything wrong wrong with warcraft and it didn't go over well for them
people really weren't happy yeah greetings mangler i come from another dimension the scorpion
historians tell me efap is the zoon cast to watch and in the immortal words of smallidius
short man good punch k dry your biddens and also buy towels oh i get it this is good cat
proto baggings good meme it's the inverse of everything except i don't know if the
inverse of bilbo is proto but inverse of bilbo it'd be i don't know um oblib oblib
why is halo ruined now i hear halo wars 2 is good uh halo 5 is the last jedi of the halo series
i've heard it's really you can go to comments of the trailers for halo 5 and it's all of what you
say where the fuck was this in the game yeah check it check the amount of damage that is
dealt to the halo series by halo 5 is kind of remarkable it's to the point that
like i'm convinced that they can't fix it um you'd have to wreck on a halo 5 out of existence and
honestly you probably got to get rid of four as well i think four on its face is really comes
across as really good but i think four probably was a bad idea as well it's kind of like
i think halo did well the first the first three and reach by extension but is that they kind of
they straddled the line really well between a scale you could believe and respect and being too
big to comprehend um they had a good amount of factions a good amount of characters uh believable
technology in a world um it wasn't so much that you just couldn't you know process it all
but with the new halos i didn't play five i played four and the story was really tis me with that
because i feel like they just wanted to take it up to an even bigger scale well it's funny you
said that because um 343 released a video recently where they're talking about we we want to make
halo this big sci-fi franchise that will last 20 years it's like oh man you're already like
well yeah it's not about the universe the scale was already fine it was fine as it was and now
it's been sort of ballooned oh yeah it's like uh you where do you go from here and if you have
interesting factions and interesting characters in a universe that's already the size it is
you could have done whatever you wanted to do with but um and it's worthwhile not to understate
just how bad the writing and halo 5 is as well like all these problems aside halo 5 is just
genuinely badly written i don't think i'm kind of amazed by how badly written it is
yeah halo's in trouble huh yes um halo infinite is probably their last chance
yeah and like the story after three and reach is fine because it's pretty cool but yeah it real
pre it could have ended it really could have ended but halo 3's the ending was like we're done
we we've told the story yeah full circle perfect you know it's pretty perfect we started we finished
there's all sorts of different things that you could do in the middle you know like odst did
that you know there's a lot of side stories that you could do but man it was a complete story that
had been told and told well um in fact i mean it's all full circle you know first game halo
it's finished now we're just getting started and then by halo 3 she's like yeah it's finished we're
done uh now i'm just sad one day uh it'll rise again just like star wars will rise again right
guys it's like skywalker will rise no sit back down skywalker please
uh it's just the new trilogy where we follow ray because daisy ridley says that she actually wants
to make more now because nothing else going on is that what she said no i'm saying that's probably
what might happen let me look up let me google daisy ridley and see what's up
i know that she's in a movie with tom holland that keeps getting delayed perpetually oh yeah
asteroid hunters i'm not sure oh it's an imax educational film they added her as a narrator
fucking count uh the okay so it looks like it got a release date uh
uh let's see tom holland and daisy ridley looks like uh chaos walking yeah wow it's gonna be shit
listen the name chaos walking i think it's gonna be terrible i think you'd be right i think i think
that i i know this is like judging a book by its cover but i think that the name i yeah chaos
walking that's uh that's a weird name so it looks like it'll be january 22nd 2021 so about
a year we get to see daisy ridley and tom holland in a adaptation of a sci-fi dystopian novel
good luck tom i hope it's a good one tom um what was your favorite 2019 oscar film and why
so mine would be joker and the why is probably going to be in the video i eventually make but
runner-up would be marriage story and then second runner-up would be ford v ferrari
ford v ferrari is pretty great you do you want to i would put ford verse ferrari higher
but that's like we've said we're we're comparing like the the top tier crema the crema so they're
also good it's kind of hard to say to the point where yeah go ahead to the to the point where
it's kind of just subjective for me at this point without having to see them again uh i like ford
ferrari more uh that's me well what's the question again favorite oscar film and why
oh uh joker probably but again it's kind of again we're talking about the best of the best here
and people like so what about 1917 it's like i like those three more than i 17
but 1970 is probably number four i guess i'd probably say
ford verse ferrari then joker then 19 then 1917 the marriage story
it's tough but it's really tough because these are all so phenomenally good
it's basically just oh yeah and jojo rabbit fuck um yeah you know wow surprised about no
parasite considering you praised that film it's but all of these films are very good
probably yeah parasites good it's not as good as these four though your parasites issues
unfortunately yeah parasite is issues but it's still really good you should all see it
yeah i would put jojo rabbit ahead of marriage story i wouldn't i haven't seen jojo rabbit yet
that's uh still on the list
i'm sure they're all great go and see all of them
four verse ferraris at the oscars yes it got best for editing sound editing i believe and one other
thing uh uh i forget something else any advice for dealing with procrastination and are you
the right people to ask about this god no i'm not oh god i'm the worst person i feel like it's also
like very specific to the person on how to solve something like that
what i mean what's it in relation to maybe they can you don't imagine working i don't know
working on something uh yeah i suppose um oh and apparently there's been some clarification
on the warcraft thing apparently um universal uh like cut out 40 minutes from the film at the
last minute and if so that would explain a lot when you say that to me i'm like yeah that that
explains a lot 40 minutes that's yeah that's a lot of content that's like that's a whole tv show episode
yeah uh we probably aren't the people to advise against procrastination no i'm not
yeah there's gonna be a shit ton of really good guides online though just have a look around
like all kinds of things that all kinds of recommendations for different kinds of people
i've not had a huge problem with procrastination in my life but um i still don't think i'd have
any answers for it i guess mauler have you read the jurassic park novels no i have not
what is your single favorite red letter media video um i like a few of them but one i like to
return to like once per year is when they break down darth vader's suit by reading a book of
like a printout of facts it's so fucking funny when they talk about palpatine's uh like
rehabilitation hospital or something like re just like healing places they say like they named a
hospital after they make loads of jokes out of it it's really good uh it's a good one i like the
best of the worst where they all get incredibly drunk and start shouting each other yeah it's one
of the halloween ones yeah and then of course if that includes plinket videos you got a big
selection as well i watch a lot of red letter media reruns like you can just go through them
and really really enjoy them they are they are good especially with hollywood star rich evans
uh he's definitely a great asset to their production um and yeah i don't think you
watch much at all do you fringy have uh not a whole lot of red letter media but uh from what
i've seen that really good just in general hi rags hello frog yeah hi mubes hello get potn
on efap uh maybe one day yeah if you had to live out the rest of your life as a toy which one would
it be and whose shelf would you be on what toy would i be and whose shelf would i be on
no weird question i don't know probably a blind person
what so you can do whatever you want yes i don't know if the are we trapped inside this toy or can
we actually run around like in toy story if we're trapped that changes things then it would just
be fucking uh i don't know just like uh i'm the playboy mansion in that case i don't know
if we can move around i just want to be a sturdy toy right like a strong yeah i would want to be a
like a tonka truck or something you know well i guess you don't have to i guess i don't have
to be a human yeah i guess some kind of an action figure i guess statute could statues
be considered well i guess you could fucking glue a face to a plastic spoon or whatever and
it becomes sentient so yeah sure you know what you're right yeah a statue of oh yeah that's right
i'd like to be something anthropomorphic you know some kind of a hominid thing
uh i guess it could be an animal depending on what it was um
um but yeah uh but i i i hope that i would want to be in the house of someone who is like disabled
uh so that i could have a freer reign of when i could move and not move like a blind person
you know like if i was in helen keller's house fuck man that'd be the life you can do whatever
the fuck you wanted or she had a cara who's like hyper aware of everything which seems actually
very likely well it's clear that these toys can still do things as long as they're pretty
much not directly seen now they can be heard even if they're seen really yeah i mean with cid
but i guess it's the special case yeah i guess but they can make voices and everything that's
okay so and she just questioned it it's like what's she gonna do think that her toy is magically
yeah so if you if you go into the house of a manic depressive person that would be your best
bet because nobody would take them seriously you know i'd be like the toy is talking to me
okay and then you know nighttime you just like play an xbox or something yeah um shooting
exclusively from a hip on the run with a 125 centimeter long viewer 98 in 1917 was ridiculous
it broke the immersion for me or really broke the image no it didn't break the immersion from here
i don't know enough about guns um yeah that's not how you're gonna hit anything uh
so yeah that's that's certainly not how you're gonna hit anything
um i have to go to bed soon how are y'all still going uh doing all right uh we're going as we you
know we we do as we do i mean i'll be off shortly i need i need food i'm dying here
uh pokemon lost me when ash never moved on misty goku oh sorry moved on misty goku meanwhile made
a based family so i was a dz uh dbz chad also the violence was great ps zoomer x-men evolution was
better than your boomer x-men uh very well also kids next door was great number four was the most
based oh yeah that show's cool and raymundo raymundo on xiaolin kung fu was the greatest of all time
you guys remember xiaolin showdown no no i do early zoomers had the best cartoons dude literally
everybody who distribute distributes unstimulated footage of sex should be thrown in jail
uh and or executed and people who protest this by crying my art should be wrecked by glow in the
dark type agencies what the fuck am i reading what the hell is this this went off the rails
um that's my art that's all this one says uh hopefully i think that means we may have
covered a meme and it was one of these so good stuff hi rags hello what's the korean movie you
recommended uh masquerade there you go i don't know if they want more information or not but
yeah i imagine the less they know the better they should just jump right in right go for it
uh mauler you're not in you're insane it's not smug don't know what that was referring to
months ago uh whenever mauler says so you're willing to accept you know there's going to be
elevator music maybe uh this says stay hydrated this is a threat oh okay
don't answer wolf it's a trap don't know what the question was
efap is the only podcast i can send a super chat to while in texas fly to california for
work drive to my hotel still not have my super chat red it happened on episode 60 when you put
it like that yeah i mean we try to go through them all we're getting there at least you know
it will get red uh orbital mechanics work a little bit different mauler orbital mechanic
yeah i i'm not 100 sure what we were talking about but i may have discussed orbital mechanics
is true yeah at some point to some degree on capacity uh what the fuck has there been
these last oh what the fuck has there been these last nine hours yeah it was it was a crazy good
time lots of been uh yeah not what we intended but oh give me a second technically at night time
you would be flying away from the sun i can't remember oh that was the episode when we were
talking about getting closer to the sun you remember i hopped in and you were talking about
that what more what else was the context oh i know that damn i can't remember it was because
somebody was drunk or something and talking about how to get how you get closer to the sun
and something like flying i bet yeah that's that's all i got sorry i can't remember the
orbital mechanics conversation this was um damn i can't remember
j kick them kick them all you think j has the power to kick
mauler you massive stop injecting pcp holy dawn
check the pcp i would never do such a thing uh what are your thoughts on the tenet trailer
looks cool shall wait and see yeah it does look cool i hope it's good because i heard that um
i heard that uh what was it um that movie with john goodman that came out recently uh
uh i'm not sure sorry
that had a cool trailer but apparently the movie was not good so i was like damn so hopefully
tenet will be cool interstellar had a cool trailer yeah why i went to see the movie
uh discover defab about a month ago been catching up slowly at work i hope to be caught up by
christmas thank you for what you do thank you for the super chat uh what's your hp houses i like
chat i am hufflepuff uh ravenclaw easel for you what about you guys huh well uh let's see what
hair what obviously i'm not gonna choose the evil people because this is just that automatically
fills out the question for me uh let's see uh sorting quiz just tell me like which one is sort
of it uh these are like quizzes you take um i guess i would be
i'd probably be griffin door i don't know anything about this like i have no idea what this is
um because these are all like quizzes and stuff it's like no just tell me like what each one is
supposed to be like um yeah griffin door's like the good guys slither is the bad guys hufflepuff
like the useless guys and ravenclaw like the kind of cool guys yeah but i wish that it wasn't so
simple like that you know uh oh well what i just said is intensely simplified like it's not you
know necessarily true in fact i'm waiting for everybody to be upset about what i just said
houses traits all right um here we go so let's go to the houses griffin door values courage bravery
nerve and chivalry hufflepuff values hard work patience justice and loyalty
hmm ravenclaw values intelligence creativity learning and wit
and slitherin values ambition cunning leadership and resourcefulness
also give me a second i'll be right back well then from that fringy which one would you choose
i don't care i didn't ask if you fucking care oh all right uh do i have to
do you'll literally go to jail if you don't
when you put it like that i don't know who are the good guys again
i mean the the thing is that they all have what you call good traits right no i don't know
griffin door all right fine i don't know i don't know anything about these are harry potter right
yeah all right i'll just say griffin door whatever
all right we'll have to ask rag totally unsatisfactory answer is it uh
bringy thanks for coming back you're a goodman oh thanks more thanks for being you know said
that they hated me so that's nice to hear yeah um more thanks for being you and have a good night
gents you too sir and you know they said hi rag so i'm gonna have to keep that in this selection
for a moment can't let rags get away without hearing that
all right i'm back um are we still on the yeah i guess if you want to make a choice
um if i had to choose it would probably be uh
probably between
Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw
why'd you call it Hufflepuff though that's so fucking lame
compared to Ravenclaw it's like that's way cooler griffin yeah um
it'd be tough to choose between the two but i would say
probably
probably
Ravenclaw
all right then yeah we can hang out it's really it's really close it's really close
what one video of each other's would you recommend the most
which one of each other's videos would you recommend the most yeah apparently
um um i'd probably recommend rags um fuck that's tough actually i'm not sure i'm gonna
go with this brown table response video just because it appeals to me with the marble and
shit yeah um maybe like i feel like the battlefield one video is but that's like
the best crash course introductory video i would say if you know what i mean right i got you one
video i guess uh but the thing is i wouldn't say that's my favorite i'd probably be like um
damn i'm not sure
probably i would i would say that i think mauler's favorite of mine is his soma stuff
uh maybe you're um like i really like the game of thrones one
even though i don't i don't even watch the show and i really really liked it
it i like yeah episode um episode five was pretty fantastic oh it's pretty great
are you ever gonna do um go back to game of thrones yeah i'm gonna do episode six but it's
not gonna be for some time i imagine it's literally there's no time limit on that one i've missed the
mark in terms of you know making it a relevant video so i can just do it whenever i want now
and i'll get around to it i do want to finish that up but obviously um i was playing guild
course two the other day and in the world chat someone had randomly mentioned uh something about
game of thrones and someone else was like oh holy shit i forgot game of thrones even happened
that's its legacy now um yeah and that's for fringies videos i haven't seen enough of your
videos because uh you don't make enough that's the thing i i half think of you in my head as
not even someone who makes videos which obviously don't now uh not at the moment maybe at some point
i'm working on a comic right now guys that'll be up like today in like a video form or you're
gonna put it up on like twitter no it's like a comic i'll put it on twitter it's uh i think
it's funny i was very much deterred from comics because i just hate a lot of the ones i did but
i think this one's pretty funny and it's a little meme as well so i think people like it
we could all just recommend to each other the stream that we all did on um jim stirling yeah
exactly yeah you got that that's some that's some efap eu to it to a degree i guess was that
were we was efapping made at that point it was right i don't remember now
it must have been my brain is trying to place it it's like i have no idea
um but yeah all right um there are streets that aren't efap
what legends of the hidden temple team are you i have no idea what that is
ah let's take a look legend of the hidden temple
oh i remember this show oh i think we had a different version of this in britain
they're like similar red jaguars the blue barracudas the green monkeys the orange iguanas the
purple parrots and the silver snakes probably the first one you said red jaguars yeah i like silver
snakes all right fringy you're lost up right sorry could you say it again red jaguars blue barracudas
green monkeys orange iguanas purple parrots and the silver snakes but what is this like i
don't understand like literally choosing from the names and colors basically just using from
whatever the green one was of course of course wow i'm pretty sure wasn't there like a barracudas
one that was kind of wow what was uh there wasn't there was one that sounded same again i'll stop
you on the one that i thought actually did sound the coolest red jaguars yep blue barracudas
okay green monkeys orange iguanas purple parrots silver snakes uh actually silver snakes i like
that one yeah i like that one too yeah so this will make you happier for me right this will be
something you can uh check out fringy c plus fair but who made this that's awesome who made that
um person who made this at twitter on fringy at fringy twitter look at that oh wait no uh
they sent it to me zigzor yeah that's awesome that's really cool that's really cool yeah i'm
telling him that right now that looks like something out of a ralph backsheen film
yeah it's really stylized a lot it's cool yeah that one's awesome kind of makes me feel
shit about this comic that i'm sure well done person you've upset him yeah that's that's awesome
that's actually i'm saving that to my uh my big file of uh of um yeah basically
uh yes someone says he looks like baltimore is like no vault no there's nothing
baltimore has no noise this is like this is like the opposite of the opposite of massive
massive conquer all right uh what online interaction do you each regret the most
probably jared i guess oh like that um
um that makes the most sense to me i think it's like uh wanted to have some fun but he's kind of
a little unhinged and so it didn't work out and so it probably would have been better in the first
place to not have done it well i guess regret implies you feel some kind of some kind of guilt
over it um but we didn't do anything wrong i don't know it needs to be that like it all it means is
that i would probably tell myself not to engage like uh like if you could do it again what would
you not do i guess yeah um yeah he's up there uh
yeah because we've because i'm kind of satisfied with the people who've become villains and why
they've yeah there's no i don't feel like a lot of them like are could have bends you know
i just feel like kind of fundamental level they're just either pieces of shit or they
don't have good personalities or something there's some reason for it
or i would have to change who i am to be on their good side because that's how they value people
yeah um yeah i guess that's the answer then um look see uh you seen why efap will never have
an er spin-off a meme probably because it's quiet assuming it's a meme video
not so great debate it's like but i don't know that was funny um oh it's got oh my goodness
never seen this error before i'm gonna screenshot it and show you error yeah
how weird is that that is very strange um working now um yeah so it's got
a decent amount of simpsons in it so it's probably in my um
my copyrightism selection but if it's not it will be added to that
uh um wags how do you feel about f-a being ddos
how do i oh i uh i learned about it from somebody else i don't go there often i just
check my notes every once in a while maybe talk to an artist here and there
and don't exactly go there often and it ends with hi wags hi rags do you recall that story
about your car being parked in a spot that you didn't remember parking in did you figure out
what happened nope no still to this day i have no f-ing clue how that happened
life is strange all time yeah uh hello mauler hello hello rags hey hi everyone that's you

currency but you know one day hundred jibs in a jab mauler i have a welsh friend your accent hit
me like a truck how could anyone not tell where you were from hi rags hi um because most people

patreon but it was canceled um amidst developer squabble and it was getting 42 000 a month on
patreon wonder james it was the game everyone was making fun of you for being on your steam account
no that would be breeders of alizium yeah there's a difference there's a couple of breeding games
yeah i just put it on my wish list is like a joke i actually have no well i don't know
fuck it why not is that still on steam let me check i i assume it is apparently breeding
season is dead didn't end up happening is it still download it from places but um
three oh it's readers of the nephilim

i'm dying here fortunately the rules are like patreon you have to get to the hundred dollar
thresholds to to get a payout oh yeah of course well the other thing is that they all get reduced
by uh 30 40 percent because of youtube as well i'm always like send these people the things
through their own things it's the best way to do it especially if they don't do it through super
chats like yeah also yeah don't you stream on twitch or are you not doing that anymore
uh no i am i just haven't done it recently you you ain't you got your uh affiliate thing and
then you just stopped yeah i know i um i every time i wanted to my internet started like
sort of dying on me like for some reason late at night um but yeah i will don't don't worry
uh thanks again for doing aragorn speech in the welsh accent i did that one of the uh
the gaming ones i think yeah it's the amusing tisms shout out to major and light bulb on discord
from gans all right shout out to them uh there is no world where the dothraki were more useful
charging than simply dismounted manning the walls this man has a tiny smooth brain he has tiny
smooth brain hi rags hello build the story arc i don't know what they're necessarily going for
that the outer world is about unchecked capitalism and it pretty unapologetically it's pretty
unapologetically about criticizing capitalism corruption but also those who revel against it
please actually play the game thoroughly rr this is the thing you can probably discount anything
you said to us in that um yeah i think uh j u socialist fig tree capitalism is about free trade
to protect freedom you must regulate like other things it touches anarchy does not make capitalism
it alters it corruption and nepotism and not capitalism i do not know what was happening to
make these comments come up uh rr this guy thinks 18th century stories about knights are actually
what knights are mongol slew eastern cataphracts slavix boyas and roman tegmenta when they fought
when they fought essentially all knights all of them essentially all knights okay
oh oh this is where we're at uh we're the knights post-modernist republican dude are
you a virgin because you sound like what get laid um have some rhino nog on me happy you all
massives thank you very much remarkable republican is the kind of person whose favorite van halen
song is hot for teacher even though he was home schooled oh no maul can you say this in your gedel
voice um and it's can you imagine an imaginary menagerie manager imagining managing an imaginary
menagerie um can you imagine an imaginary menagerie manager imagining managing an imaginary menagerie
close enough that's uh one of them one of them attempts at being a tongue twister
uh mauler i sent isle of man flag meme check it out i hope we've covered it i don't know though
wait if he hasn't seen it show the video of cops tranquilizing the bear out of a tree falling
onto the trampoline why i think i saw that but what is that what i thought for a second it was
like to help counter one of his arguments it's like see this does happen like what the fuck was
this helping yeah sure uh you guys are still going dear god if jay had children would he call
them kicklings um definitely possible x3 porn says oh you ooh you so warm
oh working xmas eve and day good time to catch up on all the efap in happy holidays you massives
happy holidays ah yes
tlj is the best star wars movie and we know that because tlj is the best star wars movie
that's how logic works am i right lads seems about right okay sometimes you get that impression
um please don't please donate these monies to hitler yeah i'll try and get a hold of him uh
he must have a paypal of some kind hello my fellow massives with riser skywalker out do you think
it's worse than game of thrones season eight or vice versa also high rags hello um the plot isn't
as broken as riser skywalker but game of thrones i think did more of a thorough job destroying all
of its characters while riser skywalker damages which is trailing along in the back you know
behind tlj yeah um and then the world building is much more destroyed in star wars than it is in
game of thrones i guess there's a complicated toss-up but it should be like season eight of
game of thrones versus the sequel trilogy and at that point i'd probably say it's the sequel
trilogy did more to destroy everything i guess it's kind of tough honestly they're both really
horribly bad you are right long man uh to think this would only go on for 12 hours so naive
uh one thing looping through my head since mando episode one who hired the ig unit
if uh it wanted to kill baby yoda no other hunters did who else knows about this
i for now we either it came from the empire because it was their job being given out and
that they just retarded and they were like yeah you can kill it lol but he was in the guild
yeah he was in the hunter's guild so apparently he was in the hunter's guild and he got given the
job by someone else who also wants the baby but wants them dead i love how mando didn't even
question that yeah you'd think that he'd be more distrusting of robots or something but i don't know
fuck it mauler when does buffy become good end of season two and season three is relatively
solid but it's the later parts of season two when uh it starts to crank it up
you guys have been a blessing for all those long shifts over the last year have a great christmas
uh also bonjour monsieur le rags ah la fromage mauler do more welsh
um red doing offy coffee
that means i like coffee red doing offy coffee red doing offy yeah red doing offy coffee you guys
pronounce rugby like a welshman although rugby unless you have to do that nice deep voice as well
because all the commentators for rugby pronounce that one like rugby versus rugby rugby
uh mauler i posted a rewrite of tlj on my channel and i have a question if holder was explained as
a political leader from the republic and not a military leader could it work for why she's
erratic but at that point wouldn't we question why she's in charge instead of poe who's like an
actual military leader like that would still be a problem if they threw her in even though she's a
political leader trying to figure out how to best you know make use of all of their resources in
war i don't know it seems like it doesn't mean and she also comes up with a plan that is actually
pretty good the problem with her plan is she didn't tell poe about it which is like the most
obvious thing anyone would have done and uh she did it for petty reasons any of you seen the
descent if so what did you think i've not seen it i have it's very good one of those uh one of the
better horror movies of the world oh my god movies about a bunch of spelunkers going into a
cave that's not been explored much and they find something not fun down there
i liked it i heard the second one was terrible that's what i've heard as well i haven't watched
it i just been told it's a poo poo in fact the one thing i do know about it is a spoiler
for the first one so i won't say but it's part of why everyone hates it um why did she use imperial
star destroyers in rise of skywalker they don't know why does she do anything in that movie
why is he alive he's like this very mean uh kylo voice very good didn't have to wipe
oh my goodness son caddy uh rags and or mauler can you briefly explain each 40k
xenos faction to the best of your abilities elder necrons orcs tau dark elder and tyrannids
all right start at the top you said so one at a time okay so elder uh
elder are a race of magic space elves
uh who are they don't they're not very strong as far as factions go they're one of the smaller ones
um that's about basically about all all right necrons necrons are sentient machines
that have been locked away in vaults all over the universe for like a kajillion years
and they got awoken by something and now they want to rise up and destroy all like organic
life and stuff because they're evil robots all right orcs orcs are uh interesting they're
the the strongest of all the factions but they're not organized and they're kind of stupid
uh all they want to do is fight and get into battles and stuff
and i think orcs have a magical ability basically to where if they all believe in something enough
it'll actually happen but they're not intelligent enough to utilize this to its full potential
wow so they have a book of destiny type situation yeah book of destiny
uh tau tau they're like the space communist faction where they want everything to be like
and become one and everything's for the greater good and stuff like that it's very very much a
collective kind of thing uh dark elder they're like the elder but i think they're they're dark
is it because they like worship chaos or something i i forget i don't know much about 40k and tyrannids
tyrannids they're basically the zerg they're like a bunch of monsters and hive stuff
and uh they they're like spidery clawy monsters in space and things of that nature
they're like the zurg in space i feel like we nailed that yeah i feel like that is the
that is perfect uh even mlp movie was better than tlj and it was a movie meant for kids
saying space wizards for kids is no excuse i agree i agree yeah there's no reason that uh
just because it's for kids doesn't mean it has to be bad i thought you respect children more than
that i hate kids but even i do uh that idiot in the first video said at five minutes luke wanted
to go off on an adventure and join his friends in fighting the empire he realized that goal and
became the leader of the rebellion did he even watch the ot yeah luke's not the leader of the
rebellion oh no what happens um mauler in your tlj part one video you go over how the first order
may have risen beginning with just because palpatine was dead little did you know he's been
alive this whole time looking forward to a complete evaluation of the whole sequel trilogy
in 2029 yeah 2029 should that sounds reasonable actually should be all finished by then
the patron patron saint of the fat acceptance community is being whose title is a being whose
title they have given is diabeto okay some say that if you pray hard enough to diabeto he will
appear and smite the enemies of the person by pulling all of their sugar out of them and
proceeding to impale those who have transgressed against his summoners with spikes of solidified
sugar no corpses from these rumored summonings have ever been discovered though so evidence to
substantiate these claims are non-existent the worshipers do say that the reasoning for this
lack of evidence though is due to the fact that after the great diabeto has carried out his justice
he then proceeds to unhinge his jaw like some giant morbidly obese snake and then swallows his
victim's hole before sinking back into a dark fluid like substance disappearing without a trace
that was um that was several messages and wanted to make sure we read all of that um how do you
guys feel oh no that's vivid i guess it was wonderful and uh i think it's just going to go
into the eventual you know movie bob movie robert uh cinematic universe you might think twins are a
rarity but they're actually becoming more common than ever especially in minority communities from
about 1915 when the statistical statistical record begins until 1918 about 13 commit half the crime
i i i figure that was the joke i don't know where the twins thing came from yeah i don't
know where the twins thing comes in the weapons grade dragon's breath chili pepper is so hot it
downright it's downright deadly if you ate one it could potentially cause a type of anaphylactic
shock burning the airways and closing them up which would mean epstein didn't kill himself
oh there you go um who do you have the biggest crush on sarah z aiden paladin or that star wars
girl also thanks for reading my donations twice money well spent i think we've read that one i
guess i guess uh that star wars girl sure it wouldn't be sarah z i i don't like clear treatment
of flies it's torturous yeah and i know i don't know much about her i think aiden's taken i don't
know if anna is oh anna is as well i ain't no home wrecker well we gotta we gotta wreck someone's
home at that point what anna's got like a yeah anna's i think she has a boyfriend i don't think
she has a husband oh well uh i guess i'll just stick with it because this doesn't really change
anything at this point uh kylo has been likened to a school shooter well considering how we're
shown he's treated by his mentor and family especially in light of the leaks for episode nine
his actions aren't justified at all but his disposition sure is i mean yeah i mean it doesn't
seem like he ever had a good life it seems like he constantly was just battered around by everybody
try to make him become you know something whatever but it doesn't mean you should start
genociding people obviously yeah please don't do that um balance meant defeating the sith as they
abused the force for themselves narrow called this view wrong and quoted lucas on it yet the
quotes are almost uh are about balance of light and dark and don't mention the jedi or sith this
is a difference between users of the light slash dark side and the light slash dark side of the
force itself the new canon basically reinterprets balance of the force as balance of the force
users yeah which i think is stupid um this gives more importance to the force users and therefore
clashes with luke's one lesson in tlj mainly the stuff about the force not being a power you have
and about the light not being bound to the existence of the jedi
i mean yeah i the way that they they do it in tfa as well kind of she says that like there's
always the light and the dark and throughout the histories and she mentions the prequel era and
then the current era and the ot era as if like it really is like a balancing act of amounts of
users keeps trying to rebalance by creating more and it's just like oh um i need food i'm
gonna hop off but it's been fun very well thanks thanks for hanging out and uh yeah no worries
obviously your link is in the description if anyone isn't aware already and videos will
come eventually right yeah something something eventually yeah all right see you later everyone
bye bye
uh saying stop criticizing a film if you're not a filmmaker is precisely equivalent to
stop criticizing a politician if you're not in political public office i'd say the easy
the easy one is just um gordon ramsey cooks you a meal ranks right and it's big to a crisp do you
complain yeah why you're not a chef yeah but my tongue knows uh some bullshit when it tastes it
and i expect better from chef ramsey you know i would too and even if it was him i'd be like dude
this is kind of boon and he's like no it's not your raw no it's not it's anti-raw
in addition to discovering that i'm welsh last year i also only one inch shorter than you
was wales conquered by the danes when they invaded is that why we're so tall
there's some short people in wales here and there you can find them
angry joe and co are clearly having a hard time seeing the mandalorian's quality drop his friend
alex has to remind him that pointing out problems is part of their job in his review at 6 14 to 6
34 episode four review who's alex a friend of his i guess oh well get on you alex yeah you know
i'll make a note of that and me and rags can check it out maybe if it's i would like to take
a look at that yeah alex come on efap razor fist said he would enjoy being on efap for the movie
bob building a better gamer or game overthinker videos if you cover them i don't know anyone
who's better at marking him i am 100 on board with that absolutely i love making fun of movie
bob movie he's just special oh yeah he's just special there's no one like him not even that's
true there's not even hitler could live up to movie bob
right we're uh you you're cool to check out some memes yeah let's do it um i'm gonna do this and
then uh you know rags uh i i would have carried on with super chats had there been any more to do
oh my god are you fucking shitting me we did it the super chat overflow is done all i've got left
is notes we've done it it only took us months but we did it we caught up with all the super chats
oh my goodness what what do we do now that's gonna say like i don't know how people will react to
that information it's done i guess we're done we actually managed to catch it up completely
and now we can just look at memes we're free to look at memes
yeah uh i guess because it's it's rather momentous it took very very very very long
sorry it took us so long hopefully the ones who took a while to get to weren't too distraught
about having their questions answered late of the few that lack context again sorry for them as well
but um like i said we were going to get to every single one and all of them were copied down and
pasted so we're all saved and we did it like i said all i got left is just some notes to
check out some things which is actually normal anyway so um fantabulous and we might actually
because i'm going to get through this selection of memes and then that's that's it for the stream
and we'll actually be turning a stream off on time without overflow rags for the first
time in a million years are we getting all we had to do is have an efap devoted to memes and
chatting without covering videos and we caught up having minimum guests um yeah anyway efap is
eating tisms well that is naturally naturally this one uh that's a good one
imagine you had no context for this imagine you'd seen captivable you knew who jeb bush
was and you'd watch mandalori and you'd be like what the fuck is this i see the parallels it's
so obvious just all coming they all come together in my head
efap every frame of pause banana frick communist banana
efap 66 communist banana
yeah i got nothing for that
you remember a communist banana banana frick communist banana
no i have no idea it looks like i've spotted in a video game on the wall there oh this is the
witcher this is the witcher yeah this is the witcher uh two somebody scrawled the longman
on a wall oh hey check this out what's your two like the no it's a witcher three i don't know
why i thought it was witcher two the efap wheel of symbols let's see
you're in the island man all right so jay's a rhino wolf is the wolf
along goes a yuwok yuwok pizza
beginning is is a
oh is that a hamster i think that was gonna be my guess yeah yeah robert had a banana
he's an alien oh yeah he's an alien yeah um cross swords for shad bat for frugal
we got dawn is the chicken that's good for metal all right why is dawn the chicken
cosmic chicken i guess oh yeah i guess so good rat handsome sheave is spider
yeah makes enough sense to me i agree
um gojo fans and then efap fans can come together when we just ask if it's an actual reference
yeah
um
winton leap it's only a sequel if you interpret it that way doesn't respect the law the two types
of quinton if uh antimatter quinton if the anti-quinton wants to come on efap you're welcome
to it yeah uh i guess this is one of those fake movie things it's a the focused horror
of concentration camps a ryan johnson film director ryan johnson returns to film his newest
hit about the horror of nazi jiminy how he exposes the truth about how the allies made up stories of
these camps in a brutal and bloody yet accurate retelling of the nazi story audiences will be
shocked and horrified at what the allies covered up for years my goodness do you think that
it'll be accurate to the source material i don't know ryan johnson doesn't seem to care for the
source material most of the time oh so i don't know if you know this one ranks but in family guy
they have a panic room yeah and it's filling up with water and they're all about to drown
and just before they're about to die peter says um i did not care for godfather like oh yeah i
remember that yeah that's an episode i saw i think it's that way yeah jay would say jay
wouldn't do this when he's about to die he says that just willy dilly he's like his smooth balls
is boring oh shit has free seen this before oh that looks cool um um well green lightsaber
i like it good touch i'll ask him
at least you'll be able to see it it's just you know but yeah that's uh it's an awesome drawing
that's really cool
oh
don't ask to say it's just cool moving on oh this one is from uh uh irregular of ours wonderful
almost comic page creators done several of them now but the star wars killers
oh good old uh kathleen kennedy palpatine jj abrams
um yes that's supposed to be anakin i guess and then obi-wan is uh
then again yeah that is obi-wan saber and that's evaders so it makes enough sense to me but yes
they're all coming to destroy star wars uh they did pretty good don't deny it they did a good job
they're good uh they're good at it
the darkness rises and light to meet it
this is seems to be the reality of what happened what can i say
oh yeah so this was um
got uh the top five worst things about star wars eu when you said the emperor lives
and so with the new canon he lives again so it's just like oh hello greedo
oh this was uh veto was put out a tweet that he was watching my video while he's uh
i guess in his living room whatever that but he had new guy as his sort of look at that point
so someone i guess drew that that was an interesting setup for like a living room
yeah uh the kitchen right there it's it's not bad it's just it's interesting like in terms of like
floor space and oh hey shad he's in chat hello shad he said all the super chats wow good effort
it's like yep we're through the ball yeah yeah i'd be friends with new guy it'd be great
yeah he seems like a nice guy uh who are you i'm jay jay who jay long man
he did end up making a long man he really did
we saw this one before but this is even different again all my other unfinished projects new side
projects i mean they're finished projects they're just not finished in terms of all parts yeah it's
not like the parts are coming out in pieces as well right it's time to stop jeez i can't believe
at the theater i was just watching that and i just felt like i had no soul
equal fans disregard all of mauler's points because his videos are long mauler fan long
man bad sequel fans oh i did see that coming oh i like shocked pikachu is good shit yeah
i guess this is ryan and jay jay fighting over star wars and in doing so they destroyed it
yeah they did well i mean they just i mean they destroyed it anyway destroyed it yeah
but then it's like they thought it was a contest the twosoms are bad
big lebowski have you seen big lebowski yeah i have not no we got some more of those movie
posters oh my goodness what is your hair he's like a troll it was in there i guess
the dawn naturally lots of ewoks big idiots maybe and jay darth jay
let me quite the episodes and yet there's more the pikeman rises
is that um the dire bleeder sky wilford bribley wilford bribley obviously this would be the
pikeman specifics movie i guess oh that's a dr eggman death star of some kind i think
and the apex almost actual naturally oh and cooked carrots i think
movies are uh still coming out you know just such high octane demanding credible action
oh we got the fish in there yeah we have the the gar oh my god the the the creature that luke
milked is wearing layers bikini oh fucking hot we got that image from like empire of the er
werewolf as well what's to work with still work with like davitas oh there you go the saga

empire of the er the pikeman rises and the jebi the jebi eternal
the wonderful set of movies yeah the um those are busy posters
film criticism police chasing the log cows
a weekend warrior as well yeah just on his way to work i guess yeah fits in
the latest from jay you are long and wise and i'm very proud of you yeah he made a one hour 20
minute on a video once he might make a video one day that's longer than the movie and then he will
become a full long man misa can bring a user in warm or misa can bring a user in big dojo
the gungalorian
oh this is a this is a metal stream meme because of his chair called cheerly
chris chair rag saldana mauler don diesel bradley wolf and tone rustle
tone rustle guardians of the chair
i like how many of these memes have made it into this election
thanks for bearing my lightsaber the sad you stupid bitch
anakin's mad
so somebody made this um i don't know the specifics of it but it's
cool i think it's supposed to be me with uh the gas mask maybe sort of thing
looks like mad max yeah i feel like it could fit into that
keel
this one's pretty grateful what i think dumb and dumber
yep i think uh lucas filmed documentary
so when i was playing uh balfour two classic i was pointed out like a really easy way to
spawn camp the shit out of the clones in one of the submissions i guess so i made that which is
awesome spawn camping long man i cloned those because stubby let's
i don't think the knife would have trouble getting through that armor i think this is a
sophistic autistic um pixel art for somebody i'm actually gonna guess rah i'm pretty sure that's
rah with the beak this is um imagining jeb's head over the new cubfu pokemon
jebfu comes from the isle of man i guess not bad yeah kukfu evolves into jebfu
kukfu oh you got another image of rags playing video games that's neat watching youtube i guess
i gotta catch up on all my stuff that dog looks kind of comfy weirdly yeah it does fun oh we got
one of goliath lucky's behind closed fences jeez yep goliath that's right this is uh i think this
was keeperkins but this is just like what the uh the paper craft sort of turned out a little bit
oh those look great um that's toenails super saiyan the dawn weekend war in wolf and then
we're in a little glass case it's pretty neat as well that is really cool
yeah i've still got mine cool
a really awesome little project um i guess after those six mainline movies they made shad a star
wall story the epic movie god um i can see shad in there got the knights of efap vision of me in
there oh movie bob's in there jeez just right the creepy fart balloon alien yeah bunch of
children i think he's gonna save goliath yeah you can do it shad
oh this one um i put it in both rotations just because it was an awesome picture um
just thrown out there is good one that's all because we showed it the wolf one but i was
just going to say this one yeah this is uh this is one of the best ones this is of all the things
that have ever been done this is among the best from yar i think that's his artist name
but yeah it's really awesome and that is really something else once we get like an efap
store sorted out one day in our lives uh i would happily like put an art print one out for this one
just uh such a nice drawing
star wars the harassment wars got a drinker jay longbone aden aper bend uh i don't know
i'm not sure who the who the beardman is battle droids they're flying
yeah they're flying out
chase as an evil empire enthusiast um i think that's southpaw
or maybe not i can't so that's the guy from that's the model from uh force unleashed i think
yeah the first one i think that's that's that's lady jobber and brown table of course
who knows who'll win
oh someone said that's supposed to be sargon i don't know
maybe i don't think i don't think this beard go white on the sides though
the middle middle sides of the chin i meant i guess
we got catwin maulis and rag say homecoming is good catwin maulin rag say madalorian is bad
chatwin rag says text drivers bad chatwin jay says spaceballs is boring yep jeez ages of
enragement i don't know if we got this on
our thing yeah i don't even know if you've seen this rags but this is apparently mupa another
rendition i don't want to make of this what do you think oh my goodness
don't insult the guy but his face is dumb this is uh an alter ego of mine i suppose
seeing videos from mupa coming out in april first get hype
get hype
rags dad meeting jay for the first time you're a special kind of stupid aren't you
oh jay i don't know what i was thinking that far
i want you to not have sex become an incel today
yeah it makes a lot of sense
i always got that impression from uh watching starship troopers you know
good shit he would it to cause wars that disgusting he would it to cause
this is a movie about space bugs intended for incels
mm-hmm not really complain about it at that point can you
so this is again one of those memes that if uh if you show someone outside of efap you'll be
like what the fuck
they have no idea what that means
uh why do i wear the mask it's simple i said donna cat subreddit kept calling me smelly
or sad molar face
this is a pretty cool album cover i guess jab did uh
did make him album after all moshington jab bush moshington i'm pretty sweet there
that got a wide release i'm sure of it oh wow check out this meme as a reference to the nazio
movie pop all right we got three nazis and two bobs what's taking so long you troglodytes
at the end of the day is just meat and bones oh yes he's so empathetic
this is some more up-to-date memes um corona chan has entered the chat efap 75 which is today
got concerned whimper from rags
i don't know if that's entirely original or not but i like it
i like it too oh that sucks um we've got molar's keyhole secrets are meant to be unlocked
i don't know my hole i guess it's some forest somewhere but uh i just hope i survive from that
oh mentioning the rags recommends they've got rags recommends closing the door no i don't
hey that might mean you know you go in there then you close the door you know there's a
there's a second rag face people pretending to be me recommending things that i don't recommend
although look at this you got top 10 countries with most sheep per capita apparently they
calculated in australia one so unless springy got the wrong numbers um look at the art of the
bob yeah it's the first as well look at the look at the art of the bob did they make that
off the you know quickly because it's great look at the little ball of sheep
cow he i mean that's probably welsh or something you don't know okay no i don't know the welsh
language i'm not i i feel like it would be a waste of brain space no offense but i got uh
yeah i got mongolia new zealand in australia well yeah we i don't think we said that wales
had the most per capita it's just that i was pretty sure i had more than australia but apparently
it's pretty close or not at all depending on what fring's numbers were um but yeah i just
like the little sheep more he's great yeah um now to just catch the ones we missed real quick
rags i should specify he alex uh has tismy takes as well he gave joker seven out of ten
and rated it low because it's a bad dceu movie and it's a remake of king of comedy
oh yeah he's wrong also hi mu lab hello
where are we thinking of doing a marathon review series tips
uh a marathon review series yeah i'm not sure what that means like the game marathon
one that's an old one that's from like 94 uh unless you mean a marathon review series
where you make a bunch of reviews for games that's probably more likely and in which case
just the the sort of standard uh advice we give depending on without knowing more context which
is just uh work hard make sure something you're passionate about stay accurate explore the whole
thing maybe compare with some other stuff uh redraft if you're looking to make something
especially if you skip first time around maybe
good luck you're still not caught up what about this one well that one's now been done uh left
to go see sonic which is amazing come back and ifap is still going love you guys also high ranks
hello and it's amazing shout out to holden in astonia doing whip whip nae nays
here we go whip whip nae nae during the mando debate you mentioned that iron man being shot
out of the sky by a tank is problematic could you elaborate on that because i don't see why
um so the not only like the the shock being absorbed by a suit is pretty unlikely considering
how significant it would be the flipping around would probably cause him severe damage bodywise
because it doesn't matter what armor you're wearing when your body's being bent and then
how fast he plummets into the ground and from how high up uh should fuck him up which kind of like
how it does to war machine that's closer to what should happen it doesn't matter what kind of thing
you're wearing and if they're just like no it's just that's just what it does prevents him from
doing that it's like i don't think so the tank shell should probably done a shit ton more to
him considering the damage he takes in other instances um yeah you know just like it probably
needs to be gone over a little further in terms of like figuring out exactly
whether it's a problem like mechanically or not
uh it it's it's it seems like it would be and it's kind of ridiculous that he just
casually survives it uh at least imo like i said i would uh it would be interesting to get some
information on it from some other people in terms of physics chad you're losing hit him with
a long man more bad more like wrong man bad it's the no you have complicated debates i got it
straight out of jeb's playbook no you what do you mean shad you're losing isn't he just chilling out
yeah i don't know if he's arguing somebody chilling out means losing oh my god how much would i have
to donate for you to do a video on outlast too your series on the first is probably my favorite
of yours the sequel is apparently even worse i'd love to see rip into it oh i'll be so far down
the list of things i want to do i didn't even like outlast i actually like what drove me on that one
was everyone telling me it's better than amnesia and i was like i need to go over this stupid game
and explain why it sucks because uh i just thought that outlast was extremely overrated
because it was spooky that's the jump scares and the jump scare music and but it's spooky
i'm high on a fight i must have myself get your long bow shad
uh i just finished evil within two and i'm genuinely sad now and i have
buffy season seven get it done to make me even more sad after efap ends yeah you still got angel
season five james that's gonna be a tough one for you to get through be great though uh why did ryan
do tlj anyway jj needed a break they always intended to do three different directors
apparently they just wanted to sort of because that's how they did the ot was um
different director every time but the thing was that george was like there for the whole thing
making sure it all ran the way that i guess he wanted it and obviously he was the director for
all three of the prequels and so they were like let's do it like the ot and change directors each
time i don't know what the fuck they were thinking honestly i think that someone just suggested it
and then everyone was like yeah that sounds fine like no one really went through it yeah
uh if hollywood makes an efap movie who would you cast
everybody's themselves yeah i mean i we'd have to go we'd we'd go no let's take everybody but
just mix them around wait actually we should animate it instead of it being i think it should
be animated and then we can do the voices we can do that i mean we do we do we do the voices anyway
so we have a lot of practice i think that wicks i think it would be very uh here we go we've got it
and if anyone says the real rags wouldn't say that i'd be like oh would he motherfucker i did
like wait why does rags sound like that uh wags do you think the u.s should have stayed in vietnam
uh
uh i don't know i don't know enough yeah that'd be my answer too i don't know enough i don't know
enough if it would have been better in the long run then yes but if not i'm not sure jay from red
letter media says parasites metaphors and imagery are not subtle but says it handles them way better
than joker does and it ends with saying he's still wrong about joker yeah jay's takeout joker
is just frustrating to listen to yeah he got roasted for it quite effectively yeah the
a lot of the top comments are still about how jay's being a dingleberry not our jay of course
they're jay it's different jays that's fine uh do a video on why the yuzang vong bring nuance to star
wars they are the ones that uh the empire and the rebels have to join to defeat i believe
yeah i don't know enough about them herself yeah i don't know
you gotta admit yuzang vong is a is a cool name right yeah
funny how that works some stuff is cool some stuff so
you know got a got a nice meme from yeah the doctor trooper's stream
face marine suck am i right my fellow humans what's the uh the dude of the video i guess
they're engaging in human like the the mask tape today yeah a blank expression
oh somebody sent me this they asked if i was gonna buy one
did they sell this
no wonder they sell this of course they do why am i even asking that little barbie frick
little barbie frick um and that one service guarantees celibacy
that's shot that's shot pretty well though his head fits right in there mostly the chin looks
a bit weird but i think that considering he's not supposed to be in there it looks pretty good
so putting him in rad check's body which i think that's what it is insulting to rad check i
refused to accept that but i also think the meme is very funny um which brings us to uh we've got
a decent chunk of memes left to look through but i think i'm gonna put them in with like some other
stream um because we've been through quite a few this time around
and we're up to date on all super chats and all stream labs which means rags i think it's time
for us to uh did farewell to our wonderful audience my god but it's only been like how long
this is a fit like this is the first time in forever that we've had a voluntary ending of
efap as opposed to ending because we're tired or because of the cap because it coincides with
some other event like it's just yeah here it is we've ended a podcast without any kind of horrible
restriction refusing anything so yeah it's a wonderful moment we did it guys we took till 75
wow uh well yeah we're three fourths of the way to 100 oh yeah 75 is a uh 75 that's kind of like uh
a milestone of sorts yeah we um i guess because we said it earlier but on the way
we've got the next batwoman reaction episode 10 i think it is that's uh that'll be a funny to have
on i i'm gonna say wednesday for now i don't know if it will be for sure saturday we'll have
another podcast planned and um could be a new guest could be not and depends on when i can get
sorted out in the time um and i'm working on tfa part three it's a coming it's gonna take me a
while to get all of it done but uh i'm very happy with how it's turning out metal's working on his
john wick video so that'll be amusing to watch when it finally gets there and
bragaroo is is coming out with some videos too we got lots of things around the way
um yeah is there anything else you want to say before we get going oh i guess uh
i guess just thanks everybody for coming on and this is a bit of a casual impromptu kind of efap
hopefully our original scheduled uh plan will get you know finished uh next time or whatnot but uh
thanks everyone for coming around sticking uh sticking in with it you know and uh putting
up with my sickness there's a lot of a lot of knowing you know sneezing and you know coughing
here and there so thanks for putting up with that and i guess uh i'll see everybody later
absolutely uh the last super chat says no and that's it uh fair enough i guess thanks for
watching all we shall return to you next saturday for who knows what goodbye goodbye everyone see
you later
