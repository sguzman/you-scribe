and like ish to one ish however long it takes for dream labs to tell everybody
I'm alive probably now ish probably now now ish the gone show why do you hate
women know what I was gonna say is you know today's my birthday yeah it is it
is yeah I'm turning like I don't know 64 and I we're gonna go to a restaurant for
dinner and you know what I'm gonna order I'm going to order some beautiful
spaghetti bolognese and I tell you what I tell you what if they come and give me
shepherd's pie instead of spaghetti bolognese I don't give a damn how good that
shepherd's pie is I want my bloody spaghetti bolognese I will like I don't
want shepherds pie I want bloody spaghetti bolognese those creatures what
do they know you know because spaghetti bolognese is this and shepherds pie is
that when you want this you don't want that same but it's important that all
words are made up so it cares how dare you language is just for a reason okay I'm
sorry I didn't understand what you're saying though you kind of language yeah
yeah I was in shame on me also fingers like spaghetti bolognese made for kids
though I'm also back from the dead I found out I didn't I wasn't aware that I
had died but I had died and the Chronicles is the Chronicles of the epic
spooderman Wars it was it was a but I am back I forced myself back from the
grave so I can have my spaghetti bolognese yeah you were saying something
about Captain Marvel and I rudely interrupted you I don't know if you
wanted to carry on with it what was I saying oh yeah just that I'd like her
powers defined because like I was saying it looks like she's been given a
significant power increase in the MCU she's stronger than what I saw her
depicted in both the comic books and cartoons that she's in and can she do
like literally fly a fly across space now well she has the power of interstellar
travel because that's that's insane when did that come to power come out
be repurposed for other things if you can if you can fly if you can fly at the
speed of light just fly at the speed of light through Thanos cool you win Jack's
like that's exactly what I was gonna say but the entire thing of like travel cap
so light speed engine like light speed is not that fast if you go on an
interplanetary you know level like if you travel across the galaxy it's not
that fast but it has to be for the story to work so she flies faster than the
speed of light is the implication they watch like they went through a couple of
sci-fi troops just before they did their thing they're like what's this what's
this hyperdrive warp starburst time jump or jump points like what is all this
nonsense why don't they just go at light speed shows look at them like I mean I
I do wonder because if you write something like that it's it's um have
you ever watched any science fiction TV shows or movies before they all go out
of their way to explain that like light speed isn't good enough when you try to
travel between different solar systems and you know planets or galaxies but you
know who cares that movie's terrible
cuz like you know I like science guys and I only have a rudimentary
understanding of it but even when you just do a surface level kind of study on
it you find out some pretty significant implications like the amount of energy
needed to accelerate anything with mass up to light speed it's infinite you need
infinite energy so even if you're traveling like a fraction under light
speed the amount of energy that you have to produce and is contained in this
thing is insane and that's why there's so much power if you ever impact anything
moving at light speed with mass into anything else the the energy release the
kinetic energy release is just a planet destroying it's crazy well that that's
the thing is with uh with a lot of these science fiction things you kind of just
have to like go with it because often reality kind of ruins science fiction
stuff like uh or not not that it ruins science fiction but more that it's like
oh we can't do that we can't do that oh man I can't tell my story now like
necessarily and then you try and find creative ways that were there there are
definitely ways around I mean like the wormhole thing is the uh is the most
obvious one it's like oh we're using wormhole jumps it's like wormholes are
theoretical as far as I can remember but uh but that can still work or just like
yeah we've just found a way to make it work but captain marvel just a human
being flying like how can she breathe in space like when was that thing that you
do it's just like cool I guess I can do this now and not die how'd she know
that she could even do that she flew back into space and she didn't know
fundamental about captain marvel she doesn't learn how to use anything she
just does it yeah like when she's falling from space it's like cool guess I
can fly now how does she even know that that's something she could do as rags
like why did she in our Lord of the Rings coverage Mary and Pippin learn how
to use a sword for longer than well raid didn't yeah but the same applies
to Captain Marvel she trained how to do hand which she doesn't use at all I yeah
we were watching Lord of the Rings for maybe for an upcoming if at movies I
won't confirm or deny any of that but we noticed that uh while we were watching
it we were like oh hey Mary and Pippin had more training than rated and we're
not even being silly that's actually true and even the even the early fights
are a form of training like if you look at the first real fight they get into in
Mordor they're not fighting that well but they're just managing and they're
learning from that and then they're a bit better in the next fight and it's a
gradual progression yeah it's almost like it was well-written
it'll just be boring emotionally you'll know that I'd love to see shattered just
right have that argument that would be so funny yeah this statement you should
be more focused on emotional payoffs than you should intellectual
consistency see I like that I find so many contradictions in that statement
because what you don't think intellectual consistency is a necessary
component to have good emotional payoff like like come on and if you if there's
no intellectual consistency for the emotional payoff it robs the emotional it
doesn't make sense like I shared this example with you just before more I'll
say it again like you know that scene between Rose and and Finn at the end of
Last Jedi where it's trying to be all emotional and and then she says something
that is contradictory and stupid and then and then just thought the whole
thing lead up to it where you know Finn was actually gonna potentially do
something very heroic and brave and save everyone and then she starts she was
really looking forward to that because I was like wow is he wow this might
actually be something here this might be something about Finn's journey if he had
died there oh sure yeah I've had someone in terms of a defense for him
maybe like at least you know dot dot dot but yeah she delivers probably the
worst line in all of Star Wars just because it's probably the most blatant
contradiction ever and you could have like understand how this went through so
many different systems of like or like layers of you know the actors say of the
writing the the reedits the actors saying it the people watching it back
like what are you getting there's a big laser destroying everyone yeah can you
imagine being the VFX guy it's just like you see that light and then you
just start making the laser blow up the place he's just like okay everyone dies
oh good one Rose and you want that explosion right after she says it you
don't want to give it a minute fucking kill everyone so people might actually
look at that scene and feel a lot of emotionality and stuff and in my opinion
it like I feel that would be because you're not really thinking about what's
happening what the meaning you know the actual meaning behind what she says and
stuff because when you do you're you're like oh oh yeah I love it because it's
so true that you should the only conflict in life should come from
defending those you love rather than attacking those you hate so I mean
profound and you'd be like like that's not even the conflict in the film though
like most of it it actually contradicts a moral philosophy that has existed for
a long time and it's that the only thing that evil needs to triumph is for good
men to do nothing which is basically if good people don't oppose evil evil will
triumph and stuff like that well I mean you know it's it's a completely
unrealistic mentality to have like it would be like saying we shouldn't be
invading Normandy we need to just tell them that we love them it's like yeah
like don't go anywhere near Germany leave Germany alone but defend the places
Germany come after and it's like guys not gonna they'll just regroup and if
she said that holder was attacking them in order to defend those she loves it's
like so what the fuck do you think if it was doing exactly you know when I was
watching that scene all I thought was you could have very easily killed both
of you like he could have easily blown yourself up while crashing into him I
was like what does that I've never been so deflated seeing a hero in this I
remember sitting in the cinema like wanting because the film I was so
confused what was going on and then all of a sudden the same like there was a
bit of emotion here someone was gonna get killed and she crashes into him and
I remember like oh god I was like wait what just happened it's a real shame that she didn't crash into his
helicopter thing here whatever the fuck it was and like no I'll do it instead
and then she runs off and just throws herself at it and does nothing it would
have been really awkward to film but if she bashed him out of the way and took
the hit herself I'd have been like oh took what hit like if she went into the
yourself do you think do you think she kissed him against his well just just
sure that's a yes what would you do with rose just rose he goes up and kissed you
how would you feel probably not grand like you know all this me too stuff is
like what about Finn and the galaxy and this is the one that had to kiss me on
the lips I like that that was the best take and the look on his face is he's
horrified and they just yep that's a wrap we got we got to go to lunch guys
all right wrap it up and then the realization that he dragged a dumpy
corpse all the way over the field
nobody that'll take an all day we just we just like blow up those two guys
they're uselessly while Kylo and Luca having this stand off you can just see
him pulling her in the background right next to him they're like 10 feet away
and they had this wait and stop is like it's all right sorry to give you a
second yes I can we're almost done to what were they when they were dragging
parts were they just trying to ignore what was going on will they watch them
what was going on like it's just yeah I was like whoa well if it doesn't does
Finn know who Luke is I forget I can't remember if they're like aware of him
but seemingly nobody is aware of the original heroes they're all like legends
for some reason even though their name should be well known and widespread
because all this sequel trilogy does is say that everything that they did didn't
do shit that's his whole trilogy coming to a full head in the new episode with
Palpatine Ratute it was like and then we can see you know Nunchuck
lightsabers everything's back you got a bigger vision of the Death Star came
back the Empire came back the Star Destroyer got a thousand Star Destroyers
JJ Abrams man not even once you did it thousands underestimating I think it's
gonna be more it's gonna be a brilliant brilliant no it's gonna be infinite have
you heard the rumor that their death Star Destroyers that each one has the
power of a death star to destroy a planet oh yeah well I'm strong as
infinity plus one that's no star lasers galaxy bomb done a giant a star now we'll
do a thousand death stars and they're all gonna point Luke and he's gonna break
and JJ will be like see that's what they wanted that's what the fans wanted and
then you'll get all those video essays they're like this was terrible because
you gave the fans what they wanted you gave into them instead of doing what
Ryan did what I just ruining everything they treat like it's a dichotomy though
they do you remember all those hyperbolic arguments they were like everyone
wanted Luke just jump around the battlefield and destroy everything
that's what they wanted but rhyme I mean I would have I would have preferred
seeing Luke actually do something yes I would have preferred that yes you
aren't you you crack the case oh man you want to see a Jedi be a Jedi what's
wrong with you I do like the implication that there are only two possible ways to
make a film make it bad and what people want or make it good and nobody likes it
apparently the best version is that is if you talk about the originals getting
together in any scene whatsoever that would have been the worst thing possible
like there would have been no way to write that that was exciting and good to
say it just would have been pandering to the audience and terrible and I feel
like you could have introduced new characters without ruining the old ones
what can I say you know maybe that was possible you could have told a story
that wasn't just undermining the entire point of the original trilogy that
that's kind of the reason why you're making if it's to survive it has to
evolve they say in a world where Call of Duty exists it is like the biggest
selling game every year they say as riotous stabbing stalls at the heart
repeatedly I think I think I've mentioned this to a couple of people at
this point because he's his new movies coming out called knives out and it's
getting really good reviews and I kind of just don't buy it because he hasn't
really made anything good from a writing standpoint everything good that he's
made someone else wrote so I don't really I'm I'm convinced he's saying all
the right things it has a literal Nazi in it so that I'm so sad why is that
why it's getting good reviews well they taught themselves to be a literal Nazi
from the internet that's one of the characters like Star Wars and like oh
these are Nazis right by the way they are let's see if Game of Thrones wins
for best writing when I know someone's gonna send me an article saying Game of
Thrones wins X amount of Emmys and I'll just be like it only matters if they win
the writing one I don't mind them winning anything else if they win the
writing Emmy let's cross what about direction what about direction yeah the
choreography is there a choreography Oscar no I don't know it'd just be it'd
just be directing I don't know but what if they made one game of thrones oh the
reason why the thing is I've been I'd be up annoyed with those ones but the
writing that's like you know you know I am last night I was rewatching the you
know battles from Lord of the Rings and I was just so thoroughly impressed by
them and then I think about the Winterfell one I'm just like yeah you
don't deserve to win anything for that yeah you got great sets and you got good
special effects but like what is happening in this battle is absurd it was
the bad progression you need for a fight seem to be what what progression was
there that they ran in a suicidal charge in complete and utter blackness you and
I think closer look would have argued that is progression okay so it's just
because it was almost nebulous like yes things happened and yet he said there
was no progression in endgame despite a very clear objective of getting the
gauntlet to the time machine Wow for me why are you trying to hate on someone who's
just trying to share their opinion
one of the things I wanted to mention today I don't know if this will be I
know that rags and bring you'll care about this I don't sure if I care well
but Randy Pitchford's thing on Twitter that Borderlands 3's peak players is more
than twice Borderlands 2's on Steam and so um okay and he said wow you guys are
great like he's basically doing a victory lap but like like I read that I
was like hang on first of all Borderlands are really successful like
franchise so naturally the players will increase if it's you know healthy but
where are these numbers from who confirmed these because I don't think
epic don't have their numbers public today I'm curious also I'm hearing a lot
about quality issues with Borderlands 3 yeah I'm hearing our framerate issues
performance issues across all platforms that's what I've been hearing and the
irony is that we expect that one to be the one that's gonna be high performing
and it's pissed everyone off this year and then vice versa Call of Duty the
laughing stock yeah most of time is proving to be quite fun this time yeah
I've already got a bunch of people saying I'll play the beta with me yeah
it's fun it's actually fun I've been playing it to be honest with you I'm
pretty much sold I'll probably buy the game when it comes out yeah same here
and it feels like it oddly feels like playing back in like 2008 2009 it does
feel like the older ones I was enjoying it and it did it did feel like a blast
from the past I mean it's weird cuz car just was to be dead as far as I was
aware like I thought it was an embarrassing sort of franchise that was
well it has been for a long time like I think the last one I bought was
black ops 3 and the last one I actually enjoyed was black ops 2 that came out in
2012 the last one that I played and enjoyed I think was advanced warfare I
didn't really like advanced warfare apparently that was that was pretty it
was pretty mixed I just liked it because it was really new and silly yeah
it depends on if you play campaigns as well because the campaign for that game
is very much wasted potential it presents an idea that's interesting and
then just ruins it by being a big you know blockbuster kind of thing whereas
with this this modern warfare they seem to be going a little bit more grounded
from like you may have been hearing the article is right but IGN they they post
in an article where they were very negative about the campaign yeah oh and
it was um it was I know that venture beat wrote an article whining about it
and it was Dean Takahashi who wrote that the cup fame cup head in front of cup
fame cup fame no that I mean the thing is is um when I read the article when
they said what it was about them like this actually sounds interesting for the
first time in a long time this sounds interesting I might like to play this
it's not just there's our tanks and there's their tanks killer tanks well I
mean from what I from what I read it's actually being like it seems like it's
gonna be very critical of of the means by which you know goals are achieved in
modern warfare that seems to be the the point of the story based on the things
that it's mentioning like you know chill children having to you know survive in a
town that's being raided by soldiers and special ops forces you know
injecting themselves into a combat zone where there are civilians and it's
nighttime and everything's happening too quickly to you know make the right
decisions so that sounds really interesting and you know I don't want
you telling them that they shouldn't be trying to do that because it offends you
like fuck off I want to see this outside of a wonderful plague doctor did
everyone here get get told that they were going to be unverified at one point
in the past week yeah I guess I might be only one who who was not told this you
actually might be the only one because you're your published author at this
point that could be that that's why they could do it because I was wondering why
like and I feel a bit weak like why why am I getting any special treatment
because or I just I'm under the radar but it could be the fact that I'm
gonna publish now and if you google my name a couple of hits come up so that
might be it but man what a stupid decision though yeah upon further
inspection you're not who you said you are sorry even though even though we
literally mailed you a plaque with your name and everything on it we can't
really be sure that you're who you say you are and the reasons they were given
because there is such good utility in that you know having the verify thing
particularly if another channel comments on one of your videos and you they stand
out it's like oh cuz I heard someone mentioned I forget who it was but like
they really like seeing other creators comment on their YouTube channels
because it means that you know you get to know who's watching it a potential
opportunity for collaborations and things and that's the exact same thing
for me it's a it's a really useful important feature they flipped quicker
than I thought they would well I was yeah period which surprised me develop
your issues and saying to our creators and users I'm sorry for the frustration
and hurt we've caused with our new approach to verification and I'm just
said you're like what did you expect what did you think people gonna be okay
with this I think I said this to rags the other day but I was like how many
creators did they expect would not appeal how many creates yeah every single
literally everyone would would be like no I earned that shit you can't just take
it away the original reasoning was that it had caused confusion isn't that what
they originally said yeah but I mean so we're gonna take it away I heard that
and this isn't verified this is probably rumor but there is some validity to it I
think that YouTube might have been concerned that they tick could have been
interpreted as YouTube approving of the contents and and therefore they didn't
want that you know to happen they didn't want to because anyway
maybe change the name to YouTube social credit system and then you know that
that's all you need to do at that point because it's probably gonna be the same
thing as Twitter where you can have somebody who's got like 2,000 followers
and they're verified and then you have someone with 400,000 who's not verified
because they didn't go on TV you know a few times he said yeah okay well yeah I
just like to get some feedback and be hard to find out about who was unverified
and who was verified because it seemed very arbitrary like there were huge
creators million subs and stuff getting unverified and and I wonder if it is
public profile that keeps them verified but all to debunk that all we would need
to find out is anyone with a prominent up public profile to say no I was
unverified too and then it really comes into what the heck is determining or was
determining who was going to be verified who was going to be unverified did you
see the comparison screenshot where they had the official pingu YouTube channel
was still verified and YouTube wasn't while trying to make improvements we
missed the mark and as I write this we're working to address your concerns
and we'll have more updates soon and when I read that I was like oh is it
gonna be the kind of fix where it's not actually a fix but um yeah she said we
heard loud and clear how much the badge means to you channels that currently
have verification will now keep it without appeal we'll continue reviewing
those channels to ensure we're protecting creators from impersonation
um yeah again like it was really bizarre that they gave you the option to try
and prove that someone might impersonate you and it's like you realize
the verification was protection from right yeah that's so there will be more
impersonators if you take the verification away so it doesn't even
matter how many there are now there will be more because I've seen it happen
do you remember that time I want to say like three or four years ago where a lot
of people's accounts were being like faked with spam website links happening
to a lot of let's players where people just invent the channel name like take
markiplier for example copy the name copy the image and then just post loads
of times like you know hey guys happy to see you on my comment section I'd
really appreciate it if you check out this link because it's gonna blow and
it's just like it's terrible and it's like yeah and they start saying like
don't trust any links that don't have a tick on them and it's like oh that's
clever and it's like by taking the tick away you open this all back up again you
idiots like would you do that and then to say that the intention of taking away
the tick was to protect against you know false accounts duplicate accounts it's
like no just saying things they're just like yeah this is good for you it's like
how is this good for you no explain it's good shut up that's good and then
she went on to say that you just need a hundred case subs and you'll be eligible
to apply and so everything's back to normal though I imagine they're gonna be
much more difficult to get verification slots are cool that's awesome yeah I
know right all channels who are working to like there's gonna be a whole bunch
of channels out there who are on 90k and they're like oh great like thanks yeah
they took it back was probably channels that hit 100k that the day it happened
yeah at least they got to keep this down like I'm happy that they've taken it
back I was just kind of like people are putting on their tin foil hats cuz
they're like they don't usually take bad things back is it like did they do
something absurdly stupid and then take it back to try and gain favor like we
listen you reckon hmm I don't know they do make a lot of changes where they just
don't give a damn and let you know sections of YouTube burn as a result
like you heard about the upcoming changes for children's content that's
happening yeah like that is fine well they're basically so if the children's
content they're basically gonna nuke most monetization which means targeted
ads and it's because the FTC find YouTube Google for an insane amount and
the exact reasons were because of they're breaking some laws in regards to
advertising to miners and stuff and so YouTube as to try and you know avoid
another massive fine basically are turning off all targeted ads because
like if you look at traditional TV there's there are really strict
stipulations about advertising for children for instance one of the
stipulations is that they can't have a product advertising something that's
related directly related to the TV show that's playing so you can't advertise
Pokemon toys on while Pokemon the TV show is playing or a he-man toys when
he-man was playing and stuff I don't think these stipulations actually in
place back in the 80s but that's what it's like now and so it's really strict
and they've found YouTube breaching a lot of it and so targeted ads are ads
that are appearing based on people's watch history and other things like that
right which is how internet money like internet advertising works at this point
yeah yeah and that's what most of the ads are that I've heard you know people
who are in the thing that's like either 70% or higher most ads on YouTube are
these targeted ads and that's where most of monetization comes from they're
valuable they're more valuable you get more money for targeted ads but
basically for any content that is made for I forget the the age they're more
12 or 13 or something and yeah and so children's content they are not allowed
any targeted ads on their channel they do not get note if they won't get
notifications anymore or comments which is just like absolute execution on so
many channels and and they target this not based on the watch history but based
on if the video is determined to be made for children and this could hit
Minecraft youtubers like so a lot of gamers could be hit let alone the heap
thousands of youtubers that just make content specifically made for kids and
and I know a lot of youtubers that make kids content that this is going to
impact massively and so it's basically almost the end of YouTube monetization
for them and we will yet to see how much how well the monetization will go with
non-targeted ads because they do get just regular ads but if they're gonna
get less money for those ads they've already getting to get a massive hit but
the largest impact comes from the fact that notifications will be turned off
for their whole channel and no comments either that's been saying yeah yeah if
you're making kids content that basically means your channel is dead
like if you're if you're not gonna get notifications when you upload now I
could be you know painting a much more apocalyptic result of this but this is
just what I'm kind of seeing as the result it'd be nice if it isn't as bad
when these changes roll out but it's basically YouTube saying now these are
the changes we're making and I can see that the hand is forced a bit because the
FTC but basically content kids content creators yeah this is happening sorry
screw you we can't do anything about it and and I guess as an official message
from efap fuck kids you hate them they're terrible we despise all children
from around the world of all colors and religions just all of the efap chat is
my are my children no and I said to you um rags talk about how you released
your video on brown table to the audience I did release my video on
brown table to the efap audience I did do that a few days ago it took like two
weeks just to show how how much it gets pushed back in the video it says hey we
just got done with episode 50 and then by the time it got released you know
obviously yeah it shows episode 50 being the last ones on mooler channel on the
mooler channel but it took it took about oddly no copyright hits for all the the
Marvel clips so that was strange but I'm glad of it I got stymied by the
monetization where they said it wasn't approved and so I had him appeal and
they said yeah still not approved and then I had to go through the creator
support thing and had him look at it again and then they said all right we'll
pass it on to our internal team and that took another basically two weeks like
that video was ready to release when maulers last video was ready I was just
coincidental there but it only was able to I was only able to get it out when I
got it out well either way it's been long awaited and you annihilated him like
it was almost biblical one could say but approached the argument pretty much
in every way and the loyal wonderful efap audience they can check it out if
they want I was put at the top of the description there's the link you could
watch it now and come back or you can watch it right fap either way actually
put them both up and listen to them both at the same time that's the peak way to
experience a rags video on Eve oh yeah people were upset that said what do you
say I've only just started rags is new video and I think about half 20 minutes
in but it was just good to see the beautiful Don's face again so I was
happy already is a pity you couldn't gush over him more ranks but you have
to be clinical when it comes to working things out in like a courtroom setting
like if you were his lawyer you'd be like we all know he's very handsome and
wonderful but we can't if I was right now if I was going to go into the lower
I mean how much how would you even start new people up on the lower that would
have been its own I guess actually a kind of a big undertaking and would have
taken a lot of time and I don't even know exactly how I would have gone about
it so I just kind of trying to explain a religion to someone quickly it can't be
done yeah to explain his heroic exploits whole life it's not easy that's
the 10-hour video right there
but yeah people are upset with you because you said dr. stranger is
objectively the worst MCU film do you want to develop that so people can be
less angry I want you I want oh are people angry about that I saw a couple
comments that were like explain yourself that's a ridiculous claim how could you
say that when you have thought to IMN 3 captain those movies those movies make
sense sort of captain or dr. stranger story just doesn't make sense like it's
literally nonsensical you watch like magic you watch it for the first time
with molar and I didn't you yeah yeah and I remember as I was watching I was
enjoying it at the start but then about halfway it started to collapse like it
just fell apart completely I was really surprised actually I was like wow this
is not holding up well at all I'll never forget the ghost I didn't I thought it
wasn't bad well I'm interested but that this could derail the whole
Dormammu reset time thing it's all it's nonsense as the rules seem to make sense
with the time thing people can break out of him rewinding time how is that
possible how can you possibly do that you can't have a coherent thought to
break out of the time reversal if time is being reversed on you you know I mean
yeah yeah I get what you're saying there I don't know like because Marvel can
play pretty you know a loose with how they follow through with certain
established things but I found with the magic that was being played around with
dr. strange is that they established basically how something could work even
if the way it worked doesn't really make sense if it is working that way
specifically and then they just stay true to that standard that they
established you can have the magic be far more satisfying and in most instances
probably not in every instance but in most instances it seemed like that they
were sticking with that that dr. strange learned a limited number of spells in
that movie and that these were the spells that it was always reverting back
to and you kind of got to see their strengths and lengths of what they could
achieve in there in the fact that when we got to see how they were being used
and what would overcome them he got the shield thing he had the whip thing he
had the portals if he was holding the ring but if you lose the ring you can't
do the portal so you need to get the ring and stuff and those work decently
enough for me they satisfy me I think I think the ghost fight was a good example
of where it doesn't like cuz they ghost but they seem to interact with physical
objects completely arbitrarily kind of like our sequence well it's like you
know they get punched into a vending machine and then something happens to
them sorry you're broke I you broke out there I broke up Fringy bring daddy
he's dead I thought it was just not working oh you back down okay yeah no it's
like this this is almost as arbitrary as the ghost scene yeah the ghost scene
it's like what what affects them seems to be completely inconsistent cuz they
like grab onto the ground when they go through but it's like you're a ghost you
can't interact with the grounds you you don't exist in the physical realm skip
to the big retarded finish where where are the electrocution zap somehow
translate into the astral realm of the unconscious doctor strange which sends
electricity from his body into his astral form into the other astral guy
who explodes him and kills the unconscious guy like what it doesn't
make sense but if that became a rule that you can train electricity can be
sent into the astral plane and then they were consistent with that rule I'll be
like okay if you consistently if I doesn't make sense though as to why but
if that's the rule and you stay true to it you can work with it and it can be
satisfying if they kind of revert back oh we can do this this is it affects the
astral thing but the unfortunate thing is is that Marvel I'm pretty sure they're
not gonna be consistent that that's I'm watching the I'm watching the fight
right now so right at the beginning of the fight like dr. strange punches the
other guy he grabs onto the floor the other guy comes back and punches dr.
strange into a wall and he hits the wall like he hits it as though he were in the
room and then two seconds later he throws him through another wall like he
goes through it why did he not go through the first wall he just decided
not to I guess what's it what's if it was triggered by thought that the ghosts
can only interact with the physical realm when they when they actively focus
on interacting with it and when they're not sorry I don't know why I get in sorry
he comes out sometimes I can't control it and then when they're not when they're
not focusing in everything they don't have interaction and they and they go
through now that would make it arbitrary because it's like whenever they're not
touching and interacting they're clearly not focusing but that could be in a like
if they explained it and that could be an explanation or an established rule
within the universe that you know you need to focus to interact with the
physical world when you're in the astral plane now just I will having I will say
this though filling in the gaps like this after the fact and have it not
having explained in the world is is a big flaw in the writing it's a problem
audience should not have to explain plot holes after the fact but I do feel if
sometimes sometimes if the explanations are easy I can go ahead and like alright
I can accept accepted if I have to jump through too many loops to find an
explanation especially if it doesn't make sense and their connections you're
making a very unintuitive and stuff then it's like nah nah it's stupid I think um
I think the thing because I I kind of subjectively I like dr. Strange because
I like dr. Strange the character was the one of the weaker parts of the movie
because it's just a jerk no but he has a very straightforward arc like it's a
straightforward arc and it works because he's he's he's an asshole
beginning and then he becomes a better person by the end I think it works and I
think with his most if not all the hero movies I'd have to go through them to
make sure there's a moment where they'll have to make an important choice his
choice was really stupid silly she tells him like you can either go back to being
a surgeon and being the best or you can commit to being a defender of the
universe I'm like you know that Dormammu is on the way he's gonna destroy
everything so if you became a surgeon the world gets destroyed like there's
no real choice there like the idea that he's like I'm gonna fight for Earth it's
like of course you are because otherwise you're dead but the thing is from his
perspective at that point in time he would have no idea he would have the
power to stop Dormammu he thinks he's an untrained like and because he's selfish I
actually think that's an inconsistent kind of thing where he would decide sure
I can save the world I'm just a surgeon I've no powers at this point if he
doesn't then he can't be a surgeon well it's that's true but you would think he
like from his perspective if he's a selfish character he would have more
faith in these trained wizards to be able to stop Dormammu they never take the
time stone off him you guys remember that he just has the most destructive and
important weapon earth has and they never take it off him he's just got it
he's their novice trainer they're like hey what are you doing with what is
essentially a giant nuke and he's like oh they're just oh it's really silly but
you know is that at the end you're talking about the end of dr. strange
like from the middle to the end I can't remember when he first gets the the stone
but they're like outraged that he has it partially and then they just let him
have it like it's not quite like the cloak or whatever it is where they're
like true they've chosen you he literally stole the type stone from its
like please and yeah because it makes sense to me that all right we'll let you
keep it because you defeated and into you know but after yeah interesting him
with it before it's like yeah yeah you're right you're like what he did
again it he just took it it's like for all I know he's just some dude like
what if he just decided yeah but what I mean is just like what if he said um
all right I think I'm done see you later guys and then just like you know
disappears it's like okay I guess we just lost that time so there is an
argument that this could be answered by the ancient what the ancient one says
right in game actually had the knowledge that he was going to be the best of them
that the strongest ever and so she knew ahead of time that he was supposed to
have it that could explain why they let him keep it when he took it I did just
think of that when you mentioned as well I'm like oh yeah but then again we're
talking about a scene that breaks endgame so I'm not sure how much credence
we should are we should offer that scene a razorback said watch the movie mauler
he earned it mauler strangers you talking about the the time stone he didn't
earn he just picked it up yeah he just basically yeah he's kind of walked in
and picked it up the kind of lacked security honestly the cloak thing as well
he's just fighting the villain and it decides to go for him that's another
thing I thought would have been cool to give us more reason for why it would
have chosen strange I do like that scene though how the clock just seemed to like
start speeding them up I actually like the strange I do it's just a lot I'd
like it through we haven't talked about fucking Mordo going evil so poor he's
just literally doctor straight saves the universe and he's like we shouldn't be
so reckless with such power it's like I mean dude oh you're talking about the
dude who's like cripples that guy and it's just like I guess I'm evil now yeah
isn't it so we're talking about the black guy that goes evil at me after
credit scene and he says yeah that was admittedly baffling to see his logic
makes no sense it's like dude the universe wouldn't exist if he didn't do
that would be a better option just don't exist anymore like dr. strangers
invested in not using the time stone unless it's absolutely necessary it's
like why wouldn't you agree with that why wouldn't that be hmm it's like the
thing to do also another thing doesn't dr. strange fall over and then the time
reversal stops and he's like oh no he's like I have to come with another plan
I remember being like I just do it again just rewind again see I can't even
remember that scene it's been too long since I've watched the movie I will say
though I don't know that I'd say it's objectively the worst I don't know about
that I don't think it's got flaws for sure we were what do you say is worse
than it free well I mean Captain Marvel is definitely worse than Iron Man 3 is
worse than it was horrible yeah nothing like panther is worse than it too is
that's a good movie what's just cuz all three of those movies have like
fundamental story breaking issues whereas with dr. strains they are pretty
bad like it does have problems but there are other things that it does well
whereas I can't think of many things that the listed movies before did well
it's really interesting the moments that cause you to just check out of a movie
and sometimes they really small but for me with Iron Man 3 it's when they're
like making your hands so hot that they can melt doorknobs at their clothes I
mean that entire thing like the whole the whole system that they have is
absurd it's like what are your abilities I make things hot hey I'm Iron Man this
is where I live this is a good idea oh whoops guess I'm dead hey guys there's a
missile heading to the house I can see it on the news it's like what that was
when I was taken out myself I remember when I first watched I was like how would
you possibly have been notified by the news that there's a missile heading
towards his house we're just here at Tony Stark's house it's uh it's a nice
you know Thursday night um Sun setting and then like 10 minutes past oh what's
this we got like some helicopters coming oh it's like why they just spend the
whole night outside the house waiting for something to happen yeah he's Tony
something's bound to happen he was sad that film had a lot of potential it did
like I was so hoping they would have actually doubled down on the Mandarin and
actually made him a proper villain instead of just abandoning like the
concept of a terrorist who targets superheroes that's a really cool you
know kind of take on how to do that you know it's better than matter a joke that
just makes it nothing you know it's better to ruin all this potential for
one simple joke that's not even that funny then Kingsley like he had menace
he did it that the trailers the way they were depicting a man the Mandarin it
really showed him with menace and Ben Kingsley or whatever was do it like that
way of doing it I was like oh okay this is like you know I wonder everyone
Johnson was watching that just going yeah I do wonder if like when they cut
the trailers and everybody's like oh the Mandarin is gonna be so cool like they
were sitting there in their office you guys a lot of expectations of it will
be fine he takes a big poop and says it's smelly that's what the Mandarin do
you know I've you know watch the soccer game and just start cheering just not
give it a shit and again it shows Ben Kingsley's range because he nails both
parts like what the fuck is he doing in this movie with this role like what is
this why didn't you just let him do the Mandarin properly it would have been
great that's one of those can we do it again movies like we do again we'll keep
a couple things the thing is that the thing that are one silver lining for me
you can actually take Iron Man completely out of the MCU continuity and
most of it it's perfectly fine still like what the next thing Iron Man appears
in is what Age of Ultron and they basically don't even nod to the whole
destroying his Iron Man suits and all that stuff and giving up being I'm is
nice to Iron Man and so just fun facts I think I've talked about this before but
Joss Whedon was like not in the in crowd when they decided to make Winter Soldier
when they decided to dissolve shield he was like I have a TV show called agents
of shield on top of that he's making Age of Ultron it's like yeah here's your
cast you got Iron Man he's destroyed all his suits by the way he'd be like when I
watched Iron Man through him like is this the end is this like is he done I was so
confused yeah I'm so glad they just ignored that part and isn't it a shame
though you know isn't it a shame that the three most successful standalone MCU
movies are the worst ones Iron Man 3 Captain Marvel and Black Panther they're
the three most successful standalone ones and they're the worst well see if
that's the case I didn't know they were the three best but it's I feel it's
evident to see why and it's not because the movies are good it's based on what
came before and the expectations hi I think it's I think that's what came
before and after yeah because Black Panther was the lead-in to Infinity War
and Captain Marvel was the lead-in to Endgame I don't know if those movies and
plus like Black Panther in particular had a lot of the well I'm pretty sure
Black Panther in the domestic domestic by US actually outperformed Infinity War
but Infinity War performed way better overall and international I just find it
interesting all we're wrong and those films are all very good we just have a
very bad and Chad probably won't like that Far From Home is the most
successful spider-man film by Bob's office yeah it's like the least
successful it is and that's a damn shame because it's probably the best one that's
great yeah it's really good but I think it's just indicative of the market it's
like you can have this really great innovative but really strong story and
people just won't watch it and yet you know Captain Marvel makes 1.2 billion
dollars or something that's what I feel like about Battle Angel Alita that
movie should it was so good and I don't think it's as bad as I think wolf said to
you but I well I'm not saying it's perfect I'm just saying I really liked
it it was a good move yeah fair enough I can see why people like that movie a lot
um and I would say there's probably you know the thing is is um that movie even
though I don't I don't think it's particularly good I think it was still
ranks pretty highly compared to a lot of other films that have come out this year
which says a lot it's just like you know this is one of the better movies of the
year and it's like I don't even really enjoy it that much we're not a great
selection us to you know the other thing that I think just made the movie appeal
to me I'm not sure if you're that's right that's my phone I just got a text
message guys I'm ready is it is it someone saying yes it's someone saying
happy birthday I thought it would be this is a this is a completely unrelated
but it's actually my birthday tomorrow I find it interesting yeah what what are
the well thanks for the preemptive one yeah what are the odds well if you follow
the logic all the logic clearly that means robot heads birthday must be the
day after happy birthday man interestingly enough interestingly
enough top hats and champagne a youtuber who I'm friends with his birthday is
actually the day after mine too so it's a session where he lives in Australia
yeah we could still be doing this stream when it's your birthday so it might
last 24 hours so before we go too far off topic just going back to what I was
saying about elite is the thing that you that set us off topic I like to or
extract me is finally going back to the roots of what makes a good heroic female
character I mean and it's not something we have before but lately lately it's
not something that we've seen where you have a female protagonist who is also
distinctly feminine and vulnerable but also can kick butt I was like yes I
definitely see that and I think that's probably the reason why a lot of people
like it I don't think there's my thing is I don't know if I can say there's
much wrong with a leader but that's kind of the problem is because I don't think
there's much for me to latch on to she's very blank like she's a good guy
because she is and she you know she has these abilities that she got back a long
time ago and we're not going to see and and it's not it's not really a problem
because I do explain why she's got all these abilities which is fine yeah you
know how you say she's good because she's good but I think that's very
clearly explained and evident by the fact that she's just she's got a good
kind heart she's innocent naive but that naivety actually works against her in
the movie and so like that's that's a good more complex character because of
that in my mind where um I mean I guess yeah I guess I mean at least she fails
like there's that she does fail she makes mistakes she falls head over heels
for the wrong guy because she's too trusting and she's too innocent and
unaware and that the whole experience makes her harder and a bit more world
savvy and things like that and yeah it's all good I enjoyed that those elements
I I guess I was left wanting a bit more the movie probably could have stood to
be a bit longer I think I think they needed to explain the world a bit better
because I haven't read the manga so I don't I don't really get it I don't
understand like the state of the world manga okay comic book things correctly
but I would agree that it's um that it's probably I need to pay more attention to
it like I need to watch it again I think yeah the character won me over with
Alita and I mean beautiful animations and you know expression oh yeah the
special effects is kind of like with that it's probably the best special
effects of the ever seen yes we do prefer it to Captain Marvel fine yes
true of course we do you'd hope so people out there think Captain Marvel's
great you know it's funny there's this conspiracy that the whole Alita verse
Captain Marvel thing was pushed by either alt right white nash's everything
like come on but no it's because one movie was good and one movie was crap
I don't get it like Rosa Salazar is not she's like Latin American she's not white
so that doesn't make sense well well that doesn't robot are you are you
talking cuz robot said maybe we can't hear him oh are you speaking oh I can't
hear him huh oh yeah oh yeah transceiver put in different screws robot had you
see Lee functioning I'm we could have missed some great pearls of wisdom yeah
I always hate to feel bad about that cuz I feel like for them this whole time
they've been trying to speak into people ignoring okay you guys you know
thanks feels bad but he's trying to fix it when are you gonna get a new avatar
row on head I don't know how I feel about the one you got now the destiny
face I don't know man it's giving you Vietnam flashback it's all over his
stuff now like it's in all of his yeah well you know what you know what was all
over the face of yeah well you know listen there was a certain flag all over
okay so so you think they're just like oh yes we can't have another Roman
Emperor because the old one's face is all over the coinage well okay robot head
if you if you don't say anything we'll take your silence as saying you hate
rags okay gotcha oh wow okay geez wow wow you offended him then rax yeah all
right yeah my back slightly say more things can you hear me we can hear you
ah very good what do you have to retort back with rags with it's not even a
retort I wouldn't even make it fucking robot head fuck him we can try you can
try so many others have tried what hope do you have when when I found this head
and and I changed I didn't know where it was from I needed a three-dimensional
head for a video and I thought that that head looks pretty cool I found it and
yes yeah I mean so the art the art direction in destiny is really good it's
just a shame that everything else is awful and then people start asking me
about the game and I thought oh yeah this kind of reminds me of um you know
when bearing used the bear from Total Drama Islands I'm like every time I
watch this video I'm like oh this is like the bear from that show and then
eventually it became an issue yeah and I keep meaning to fire I need to find an
artist to do me a new one that's just mine but um yeah it's got out of hand
now so now I just have to go with it so you can always change that means my
you may sort through the fat means you might find something yeah yeah question
if you change would that make you a trans robot no he could still be a male
robot well he doesn't even have a gender because he's a robot so can a robot even
be trans I have all the I'm wondering I can actually be anything we can be a
transformer so what are your preferred pronouns sir what you just it tripod the
correct nomenclature when you don't have the pronouns is to say what is your what
are your pronouns creature they prefer it I was trying to say when no one was
listening to me and I thought you're all being rude that Alita I think shows how
bad the competition is that like I understand people liking that film but I
think people like it because the other films out at the moment are so fucking
terrible I think if it came out in like the 80s it would be an average action
film probably like because there were some other really good contenders for
you know strong strong strong free okay so I'm talking about actually proper you
know good well-written female we're talking like you know Ripley Sarah
Connor you know those nice characters but I see people loving it and I think
that they're latching on to it because they freakin hate Captain Marvel and
there's shit I think part of it is it's it's a really straightforward movie and
there's probably value in that when you have movies like The Last Jedi that are
just a complete mess because they're trying to you know be really profound
and they just don't understand the fundamentals whereas that movie is like
it at least even though I don't think it fully nails it in that regard I do see a
grasp of the fundamentals of like you know a straightforward character arc and
hero's journey stuff like that you know it's sort of like basic general things
that people tend to like yeah and even things that shouldn't really be a
feature become a feature because of this like did you hear the controversy over
Alita having too perfect a physical you know body basically like that she was
too slim and you know her body was too fit and that's that's evil and I was
like she's a robot yes so such a non-controversy but the fact that it's
like screw you we're gonna make this you know female action hero be attractive
you know in the proper conventional sense I'm curious about this because I
also people say I do see people say things like how come in video games like
female characters attending to skew like a white because I think the thing the
problem with video games before was that basically all female characters were
over sexualized and now it's like you can't make sexualized female characters
and video they went for at least like one to zero instead of acknowledging
well I think I think Mortal Kombat 11 was a good example every male
combatant in Mortal Kombat 11 has a topless variant but none of the female
combatants have any like you know just bikini variants I don't really care
either way like I don't care but it's just interesting that that's like with
the men they can be completely topless and that's fine but with the women they
can't and I kind of feel like that's going isn't that just going backwards
wouldn't it be better if everybody was like everything or nothing you know
it's about equality with content that is generally more geared towards a male
audience and action movies generally are and generally men tend to like action
movies far more than romances and stuff like that what is wrong with then
making the characters appeal to that demographic there's nothing wrong it's
like trying to shame men essentially saying no you're not allowed to be
attracted to attractive women and we were going to force you to look at men
there's a lot of women out there who are like wants those parts and like being
yes appreciated for the work they do on their body that they have people being
like dress yourselves for goodness sake respect yourself I remember I'm k9 with
uh malina having the bandage outfit I mean I think I think Mortal Kombat 9 has
really bad character designs to be honest with you I'm just saying that's
as close as they could pretty much get before being a character and then nowadays
it's like that would be outright offensive
yeah I'm not even talking about I guess levels of modesty
I'm yeah just general physical appearance how fit they are and stuff is
and you see this in Marvel comics have you seen how a lot of the female characters are
being drawn and just pick up any Captain Marvel comic right have a look at how she's being
drawn now I don't really because I think with comics it's like there are I in the 90s
like I I'm not a big fan of comic book art from the 90s where people just to downright
unrealistic looking to a degree that is off putting um yeah I tend to play more yeah I tend
to say unrealistic in what way you talk because like well comics are meant to depict a like an
extreme where the male characters are buff beyond belief and then the female characters
also have well yes they're unrealistic proportions but I that's kind of the whole thing about
comic has you are godlike characters um I mean it depends on what comics we're talking about I
mean comic book is just a format I think you're just talking about superhero comic books I'm
talking about like just in general I guess viewing it as a as a medium but yeah but when we're
talking about superhero comics um you know like Rob Liefeld the artist um who a lot of people
consider to be very bad despite the fact that he was like the artist on some of the best-selling
comics of all time um he did that Captain America one where like his chest is puffed out to an
extent that is just insane oh and where like female characters you can see their butt and
their boobs like facing towards the camera and it's like how is that possible if yeah because yeah
I think you were talking about there is there's unrealistic proportions and then there is bad
proportions where it's just like a mutated message it's just a result of bad comic book art yeah I
think I think what I was uh because when it comes to comics now I think the issue I have is not
necessarily that the way that characters are drawn is bad necessarily but more that they tend to all
be drawn the same way so it's very homogeneous and boring like like the way that a lot of our
characters are drawn now is it's like they're they're lean they're not too you know shapely
in any one way they're just sort of like lean or slim or buff and and like that's it if you know
what I mean it's it's it's kind of like boring to see them all look very similar yeah very similar
facial features like even if all the say the body shapes are similar I don't think that detracts
from the the the core experience of what say a superhero comic book is meant to betray at all I
feel actually enhances it I see I'm a fan of novelty if the but like for comic books I reckon
you're there for the action the story and stuff like that and having you know the superheroes
depicted in a heroic way I I don't think that detracts from what the the action and the heroism
and the story in any way I don't think I don't know if it detracts I just I don't like it personally
okay like grotesque then it's well great all right if you want to think like an example
the standard I refer to you should look up jay scott campbell's comic book art and uh uh one of
his best works is danger girl okay and he is one of the most amazing comic book artists like in
history in my mind and I reckon it's pretty good he's he's insanely talented but the thing key
feature about his art he makes his characters look beautiful both the men and the women they
are just astoundingly attractive right and that's the whole thing about comic books and stuff
that's the that's one of the draws the features and and like I could I could read a jay scott
campbell comic book even if the story was crap because it's just so beautiful but like danger
girl is such a hilarious kind of parody send up um of the james bond spy kind of you know um tropes
and stuff and it's over the top hilarious and also beautifully drawn see that that picture fringy just
yeah rob life film that's a horrible picture that's a horrible picture can we bring up like
the biggest kids i've ever seen that's like a meme picture you don't even have to watch me
that's rob lifefeld right there yeah like he wrote the best selling comic of all time he wrote
he wrote an illustrated x-force number one and it's bad it's really bad but it's like the best
selling comic ever all right see there's that now bring up a picture of jay yeah pick pick
from nama campbell this is apparently a jay scott campbell fine art print of captain marvel
i think it looks pretty good yeah i like it yeah yeah i mean it's not realistic but it's it's uh
it's it's i think i think the main thing is um when it comes to art it's like realism is not
necessarily the objective it's more so that um it's consistent it's consistent within itself
so like there are certain objective qualities if we could bring up the captain marvel picture
on the um on the efap screen um there are consistent objective qualities that make this
just gorgeous and part of it is the amount of motion that like this is a slow yet it feels like
there's motion like there's movement in it then there's the flowing lines i don't know if i'd call
it an objective quality there i would say that there are certain things certain principles of
design that tend to work that's what i'm talking about and you can duplicate it and they consistently
work really well and then if you put it in the correct proportions and balance to each other
i mean one of my like it's not a goal anymore but i used to want to be a comic book artist as a
career ambition and and so studying you know comic book art was a big thing and i got to a
competent level not nowhere near as good as campbell but you can actually look at my comic
book out on my deviantart page yeah we should probably bring that up but if you got a link to
that whatever yeah oh my deviantart page one of my um actually i'll take a look at that yeah
upload one of my comic book um character pictures because it was also an outlet for my writing
and so yeah i'm coming to say where's captain marvels speak to the manager haircut that she
had an end going i uh i i don't like the the short haircut that she has in the comics now
i like long hair what can i say yeah i don't mind i don't really care if it's long or short
on a chick in the comic it looks a rock but in endgame it was like christ i didn't think
you could make me dislike her anymore but you have just with that hair cap here's a question
in universe so how can you cut captain marvel's hair right because it's captain marvel's teeth
with her teeth he's more but she's powerful enough to affect herself what could possibly
be strong man captain marvel's hair yourself guys guys don't you like this cover for cable
and dead pool where like cables arms are bigger than his head several times over
isn't this great so look at my last one like
so there's one of my arm drawings there it's not bad it's not bad it's not bad at all
oh when you close your youtube channel to draw babes i mean i mean her waist she doesn't have ribs
that's the only problem well that's kind of the thing i like you draw them in the proportions
to make them look beautiful but also trying to convey a level of um you know movement and flow
to it and stuff and one of my big influences was jay scott campbell with just how gorgeous he makes
and like yeah clearly her thighs are as wide as her waist obviously but part of it is to do the
you know overly um uh like extreme proportions to get the kind of look um yeah i think i think
there's an extent that you can push it to but where the line is drawn i think is it depends
because i prefer it when they look like real if you know what i mean like i prefer it when
the character looks like a real person who could exactly like like we looked at that captain
marvel one before it's like i do like that a lot um people don't like their their proportions are
not anatomically correct though but that's fine because they're kind of consistent within
themselves you know like yeah there's nothing in there that makes me go nah this is absurd
like it's um do you know what jay uh sorry jay scott campbell campbell he's actually been
receiving heat recently as a terrible sexist for drawing women in a in an attractive sexy manner
and so isn't that positive heartless bust nope that's negative that's the middle case
and uh and so when uh just hearing about the the you know um a twitter attacks that's being lumped
on him recently i was i was i was disappointed here because here's a comic book legend in my
mind back in the day and he was one of the core inspirations for my own artwork just for how good
he is i mean i uh when it comes to like the artists i like in comic books a lot of them are
the older ones like the the the veteran ones you know like um like i mean i guess you could call
greg capolo veteran at this point he's been working in comics for like 20 years i think he's really
um i like uh jim lee as well that's kind of an obvious one oh yeah jim lee really good um
and frank miller i think is really excellent but his is more so from like composition
it's what i find really impressive about him the way that he just constructs a comic book
i mean i think i think he's the best i think he's the best i like monae
are you sorry yeah nice nice flowers all right uh my favorite is video in the dragon
up and coming comics i like him because he draws tits and i like this
another phenomenal artist was michael turner he's passed away now maybe rest in peace but
he was an amazing artist i think uh i think what i'm interested in in the in the comic landscape
now is because a lot of the people who are really good like you know they're really sort of
venerated were working in the 90s and the 2000s and you know now they're like getting into their
40s and 50s and they're still around and they're still working um but what was that who burped
that was probably robot head rags trying to do stealth bibs he usually says belch
gotta sneak that one past us did it rags yeah so i guess my my whole point is like comic books are
meant to be gorgeous and beautiful they're they're drawings okay and if the drawing is crap when
you're reading it it detracts from the experience and stuff and so part of having the beauty in the
comic books is the beauty of the characters in make them as you know idealistic as possible
especially for superheroes and stuff and what you see now being spat out by marvel is just trash
i mean i'm sure there's still some good artists that are still doing good work but a lot of the
stuff i'm seeing nowadays it's just absolutely garbage but do you mean do you mean bad from like
an actual art standpoint or bad both both art standpoint and the way that they're depicting
the superheroes because they can't be too unrealistic and stuff like that when they're
superheroes i mean i mean i feel like they're because i don't know if i fully agree with that
i think that there are i think there are there is a lot of good art in comics still um maybe i'm
just seeing the crap ones there could be a lot of good ones here i uh i think because uh i'm a big
fan of daredevil this is no surprise and i i read like uh the daredevil comics and they've had good
art for a while there was a there was a run that was not so good uh the mark wade run um i didn't
really like the art for that at all it was really simplistic and bland but um but the recent stuff
has been really really impressive like really impressive uh art wise okay um but admittedly
i don't like i don't read as much as much in terms of comics as i used to because it's kind of like
an expensive hobby uh someone mentioned moon knight moon knight had some really cool art as well
moon knight's really cool no flame is easily the best though
who's that someone gary may not introduce me to no it's like a short-lived
comic series created by somebody where the the superhero is powered by cocaine
takes cocaine that's what gives him his power i was like oh my god i'd watch that at a heartbeat
let james gun make it
that'd be funny i think oh yeah is there is there a video we're meant to be watching well
i was actually gonna say it it does oh yeah well i i just kind of jumped into this what what
actually was happening that was the intro one hour and 20 minutes excellent job how late did
you guys start well i mean we had to start quote unquote late for the australians right
oh late regard it's late for us but you know for them
them it's nice i thought you started oh i thought you started normal time no uh sorrowly enough
struggle to get things on time these people like we have to sleep it's like what is that nonsense
what is sleep um but yeah i was gonna say this works pretty well as a sort of segue if you
with all of you objectifying women as you were doing just there i love objectifying
with as rag said the male of gays um but we we have a video that was that was highlighted to me
and um i've only i only saw this the introduction to see if it was real it is real uh the guy is
serious at least oh really fortunately uh it is titled men are ruining star wars men oh oh
i mean just by the title that's so profoundly sexist just reverse it if there was anything
that said women ruining something the ringing that would come as a result it's just it's not
really sexist is it because sexism is only possible with a higher power versus lower power that's where
i've been that makes total sense it's not confusing at all it also implies that every
man is more powerful than every woman it's like i get we need that makes a lot of sense because
you know like men are far more likely to be homeless than women and yeah so i mean you know
i'm i'm a lot more powerful than hillary clinton i mean right now maybe she could be like a empty
skin suit on the floor i don't know what she's up to we need women to save star wars
from the evil men who destroyed it isn't that what um isn't that wasn't that the point of that
jonathan mackintosh video like the last jedi is about men learning to trust women's judgment
it's like how did you get that where did that come from maybe if women made better judgment
we'd trust them more i mean that video was basically that i'd review i mean and what's
weird about this right is it's forcing people to look at everything through the spectrum
of gender and and so by their logic would you then say well george lucas he was a man he created star
wars so that means star wars is great because of men and that's just a stupid thing what if star
wars is good because george lucas instead of being a man just had a great idea and you know
he had the ambition and he made something amazing okay and gender had nothing to do with it it's
never that simple not in upside down land it can never just be an obvious answer just be good
no there's always some underlying reason for it that has nothing to do with any creative enterprise
so is everyone ready to hear this incredible log no no yeah oh this wonderful guy here we go
hey dale here who dale oh god he looks oh he looks like he looks like a
what right how does he look like what does he look like faggot don't let us see those
he looks like a creep i might regret this but that that t-shirt's not helping me not want to
slap him across the face i'm so fly i'm so fly i never i feel so bad when we do this because
probably outside of the video i'm sure he's a really nice guy i'm not sure if he says things
that i disagree with him you're not sure well we don't know what rags just said he's a shit well
if he's comfortable saying that men are ruining star wars i imagine it would be tough to get along
i'm already leaning on the side of he's an asshole we'll have to we'll find out in the
video i guess we'll say his slight came first because we all we are all of of the team men here
this is true and for some reason by virtue of what's between my legs i'm ruining something
i thought i thought you actually had to do something to ruin something but okay no you
exist and that's enough yeah it's what you do it's what's between your legs it's ruining something
ruining something you're just doing it wrong i talked to you about one of my favorite things
star wars but i want to talk to you about how i think men are ruining star wars
they're ruining men
does he have like a disney umbrella network 1901
i'm sure you're like dill you're a man doesn't that mean you're ruining star wars
well yeah it's possible i could be ruining star wars
what are you saying from the video you don't you're open to the idea that you can be convinced
that you are destroying star wars i mean what truly believes that is that i guess you could be
unaware of your destruction towards star wars as well jeez i guess you don't even know what it is
he's like you're ruining it you're like oh i don't know really see i i was gonna say how do people
of such a mindset have any self-esteem but the answer of course is he is virtue signaling like
by admitting my own guilt i am so moral and stuff i'm gonna get so much pussy by telling all the
ladies i'm ruining star wars oh well i mean the natural implication is is he gonna argue with it
saving it is that going to be we go in there i don't know we can still find out well i could be
ruining star wars i'm i'm open to that um it's just more there's a lot of great men out there
don't worry men there's a lot of great men out there thank you for that generous allowance that
there are many great men out there asians are ruining star wars now before we get started you
know there are a lot of great asians out there but in case you didn't know in case you didn't know
the status quo is that men are so horrible i need to tell you there's a lot of great men out there
some men are great there's some interaction what what is the point of these statements like
hey you know humans are bad but there's a lot of great people it's like so what the fuck you even
saying like just saying it like he's not one like he's talking to me at some other
i'm an ally you know i'm an ally i'm an ally i'm a great guy i'm i'm trying you know that's all i can
do i can i can try oh you know it's so hard being a man you know who hates women just by default i
guess people want me to write it down what would i say for gadelve i mean like all men are evil
some of them are great sure no it's just like thank you for the generous allowance that not all
men are shit you would you would hope you would hope that would be the default but it's not
unfortunate well not from his perspective like if you meet someone dependent on their gender if
they're male okay you should expect them to be bad because that's the most men but but some are good
but because only some are great you should expect this guy or this person you're meeting
because they're a male to be a jerk well the thing is i would like to ask him his numbers because
when he says a lot i'd be like how much is a lot give me a percentage and if he said anything less
than like 90 or 80 i'd be like okay jesus christ you have a very unfavorable view of humanity don't
you guys what neighbor would be living in guys he has a lando calrissian funko pop oh oh and it's
it's the new vision as well i think i don't think that's the old oh yeah that's the that's our
dumb global one who is this still just just consume product and be excited about next product
i'm sure he loved solo i'm sure he he's a huge fan of solo solo as he has a fucking lando calrissian
funko pop
oh no pups don't tell you everything about it yes they do they actually do
all right you're attacking just so you don't need to defend yourself there's something
different about yeah and only the shitty ones will defend themselves you're not allowed to
enjoy it for more than a couple i'm not attacking you have you seen the title of the video title
titles i'm getting mixed messages you're a cunt i'm not attacking you all right even though the
title is euro dick he's already set this up to be if you counter this video or respond to this video
or anything like that then you're one of the bad ones and if you're a real good man you will just
accept this video and move on with your life you won't disagree yeah faulty premise um
um is there any chance so you can pull up the chat rags for for a weird set of reasons i can't
actually ban people myself because the way i've got my chat set up but um yeah yeah yeah i was just
gonna i was gonna say if you could keep an eye they're not too there's not too much mainly coming
from singular accounts i don't want the chat to have their experience ruined or folk um let me
click yeah let me click the button fuck them up rags yeah fringy if you want to say something
um i can give you the the wrench as well you probably should oh here we go oh no i'm i'm
i'm all right well i mean so you can slap people if you do you not want to slap people
oh yeah give me give me whatever rent yeah give me a wrench uh there we go i gotta i gotta pull
up that'll be that'll be good um if you just say something in chat so i can grab your name
oh all right makes it nice and easy for me
you think hat man joe has right hello but i accidentally broke hell
i choose to tip for that in some way he just he misspelled hello i did oh
fellas need slapped oh there you go i can get dust bullshit into wrench motors
yeah that's bullshit isn't there you go now cap man joe is not going to be able to
have your address what is that spams you know what that is i don't like what what's the right
why okay uh yeah anyway back on with this wonderful man this great man yourself there's
something different about star wars now you're not allowed to enjoy it for more than a couple
hours before reviews then don't read the reviews and don't read the reviews so much
and just enjoy it just hang on like he's saying you're not allowed to enjoy it and i i mean i
think he's taking this from the fact that when people try and say for instance last jedi is good
i would generally say no it's it's a pretty bad movie or i felt it was bad that's not saying
you're not allowed to enjoy you're allowed to enjoy stuff yeah crap but that seems to be what
is interpreting that that that but if people saying something is bad he interprets to mean
we're saying you're not allowed to enjoy it when has any of us said that i think being a victim is
important yeah tell about being a victim i mean i do think um i think the implication is that by
telling people how something is bad they won't like it anymore but to me it's like yeah that's
you you decided that there's nothing to do with us really like you know
whether or not your emotional state will change in terms of how you see this art uh once you've
heard a selection of facts statements from us it's just like what are we supposed to do we can't
control that sorry man you feel that way but you're just gonna have to learn to be your own
fucking person i guess yeah and and i i think this is the classic though the so you take a
conversation someone says oh i liked last jedi as long as i didn't like it that's as far as the
the feelings conversation goes and then one of them says i don't know i just really like pose
arc because it really showed that he learned a lot from that initial fumble the end and then
that second guy explains over course of like 20 minutes how that makes no sense whatsoever you
can't even make that statement because that's just not true and then you'd be like wow you
just don't let me have my feelings don't let me enjoy it it's like that's not what just happened
no you can have your incorrect feelings
you're not allowed to say that like luckily people don't choose their beliefs and what i
have said right now has already planted its seed and it is growing so lowly but surely
inside of your mind and before you know it you will hate this movie as much as i will
i do like how he says i'm not allowed to enjoy things i'm not allowed to hate things dick
yeah it goes both ways
it's like guys stop being toxic guys can you keep your opinions to yourself you're like oh this seems
yeah all right let's let's carry on with how he's not allowed to feel like i said i've never
understood this argument anyway how can i stop you from feeling stuff well it's because people
associate um like with good they think if they like it it must be good it's like oh no you can
like stuff that's objectively bad i really like some of the fast and furious movies and they are
really bad um but the reasons why i like them i think you could objectively quantify for you
know for certain things like uh you know just the the silly fun of it and stuff um but yeah so uh
when someone says i like it and then they try and qualify it and then you're like well no
those are bad reasons you're making me not like it you can't like it the thing is i have that
ability yeah exactly it's like i'm not a mind i'm not a mind manipulator i can't like telepathically
make you choose to dislike the movie now what do we know that it's not good you we spent a while
trying to explain all of our issues with with dr stranger then we all like shared the oh by the
way i like dr strange yeah it doesn't take a real ability to like it it's really easy i like venom
and venom's awful it's really bad so i like it and so yeah well we have a big conversation all
about venom but then then freaky ends it with guys just don't let people like stuff you're allowed
to like things and i feel really dumb saying it's like i never had the power to take that away from
you anyway but thanks for giving me that power yeah it's like you know we can't make you not
like stuff that's just your brain man that's just that's all you what's annoying strangely
but they strangely attach their personality to what they like and so they're they're personally
attacked like funko pops let them like yeah exactly well i mean look at all the stuff in the
background look at his zelda stuff like he probably is not like it's probably a part of his identity
so you're like hey guys that's why my princess isn't great you know he might he might get really
upset about that is he framed a comic book back there as well he has he's in frame the infinity
gauntlet uh arc all right yeah family picture that's the nice bit of the whole selection i
think yeah that photo doesn't say anything about him what's that like abstract piece of
shit that he's got in the background there how dare you oh modern art if he is a fan of
actually looks like a skid mark like
modern art is so meaningful the infinity skin mark you know there was jokes in comics and stuff
about how you put a piece of poop on a pedestal and everyone like appreciates i was like oh god
we're getting close to this now like with this is this is that's a poop painting that's a poop
painting that's a poop painting online and trolls are attacking and calling out like calling it
liberal feminism and saying you know it's not my star wars and people asking for jar jar to come
back now yeah even jar jar is better than what we're getting now that's how bad it's gone that's
how dire it is yeah i think jar jar would be an actual like you'd have a sort of like oh look at
how are they gonna kill him yeah uh oh yeah that's right he'll get blown out the airlock
like oh jar jar's dead cool all right do you notice he did the little redneck voice in there
he did the redneck voice yeah yeah yeah out of any character that they'd be willing to kill off
jar jar would be the one that would probably make me happy you know actually that that redneck thing
i if you're watching a video on like it was a british person and um they were speaking you
know proper sort of westminster british accent and then when they were like talking about an
opinion they didn't like and they just went all cockney that would be really obvious yeah well it
would be it's like oh you know uh you know tea and and and uh i don't know tea and uh what what
what's what are other fancy british things you know oh this ain't my star wars you know
oh this ain't it you know this ain't my star wars tea it'd be like oh that's uh that's a
bit of addicting crumpets and biscuits biscuits and stones and teeth and uh and colonialism you
know i've i've added i don't know why this has to be the case i've added cat mad joe to my blocked
words now i will remove it one day because who knows what it'll take us it was like mola remove
cat mad joe in order to prevent criticism no no um but yeah hopefully that makes it automatic
eventually to give my moderators a bit of space automatic yes uh no i win i i uh i will be back
in like 10 minutes just a heads up i'll just be off and i'll be back in like 10 minutes yeah
yeah yeah yeah you bet all right you shall be missed anyway i gotta pee any i gotta pee anyway
so you know just you know well if we're having a break i might take that opportunity i mean i guess
it'll just be me and robot head chilling yes um i'll wait until rags comes back rags rags i'll
do a tag team he goes first and then he can tag me out when he comes back what are you uh are you
looking to get a drink or uh bathroom yeah go go go for it it's all right it makes more sense to do
it while they're doing it because then we'll all come back at the same time okay okay okay
so robot head oh no robot head cutting out you're gonna be by yourself i can do it awesome am i
can you hear me okay yes
so they can't do the uh it's a lower class voice in australia we've all got the lower
class voice you're all a bunch of prisoners yes how is prisoner life going well
yeah it's good it's good we get to go to the beach and
have barbecues put shrimps on the barbie have you drink fosters here's a question have you read
the um the episode nine leaks normally i avoid leaks even if i don't care that much just to
enjoy the film but this one it's it's too much fun reading them like it's just because it's like
anything goes just just i could read anything and believe that it's going to actually be in
this film there's nothing too out there or too crazy yeah i don't know if i've i don't know if
i've read them all if i'm up to date but whenever i see them it's just yeah it's too tempting to just
hear what craziness they're going to come who are they going to try and bring back or who are they
deciding they're going to bring back or so i think the last one i heard was about um uh
laya doing the training so which is bizarre of all the times down to training you do it in the
finale okay with the dead actor and does she need it she no one can beat her i think i think
she's okay oh that'll be the obvious thing if she builds up in order to be kylo we're all gonna be
like why it was me all along i killed kylo ren me i can i can imagine her turning up to a bit like
i have trained i'm far more powerful than before he's just like jesus christ like really cocaine
powers imagine him just being like you know what i give up i don't want to do this enough i i just
like how anything goes with the rumors but no one knows what actually we're going to watch this film
well there's we've got a point in star wars where we're like no that's too crazy they wouldn't do
that that would be silly it's like when we're you know return of the jedi we're like you know
where will harm survive and was it really his father and all these questions we wanted answered
and with this it's just like they can say anything we just have to believe it because there's no
no point to even going to see this film we don't even know what's happening i can't wait for episode
nine remember rags as well i feel like i'm spoiling it but people will forget by the time
but um the end of fellowship it's like oh my god the potential this we we know so much to look
forward to it is like direct comparison with tlj it's like uh i don't know
uh did anyone watch the gremlin's review from red letter media i did yeah what they
talked about how gremlins too is like gremlins but on like steroids in looney tunes land in a good
way because that's the idea that they're going for that they like have we ever seen that with
like other franchises like i don't know star wars they're like oh yeah tlj is the looney tunes of
they have more digs last jedi and other reviews than they do yeah it's like every video now
yeah yeah they just mention it every video i'm so happy it's almost ubiquitous with with a lot of
the critical reviewers that tlj is just the the jump the shock it's the movie it's the go-to like
oh you don't want to be like tlj what a disaster um i mean fring you'll probably be back soon but
you guys want to we'll kick on with this he's gonna be well if he's gonna be back soon mauler
mm-hmm well he said he'll be gone for 10 minutes 10 full minutes do you know what that is an efap time
13 minutes i don't actually know it's like how did you how did you work that what was your
formula and i'm like i keep my secrets to myself um well we'll play he's only gonna miss a couple
of like 10 seconds of uh-huh and i love what disney's doing with star wars i bet you do
in the sense like i want a star wars movie every year i think no it's not the focus at all that
shouldn't be in what scale was it too early i like the idea that we're all like we want good star
wars movies and he's like no no no we want star wars movie every year and it's like no
oh they could tell me three four five years between each one i wouldn't mind
just take your time get it right you know but they also pretend that if something was fantastic
it couldn't come out every six months like solo was too early you know it was it was brilliant
it was just too early it wasn't the right time people didn't yeah it just wasn't we weren't ready
for such a masterpiece people people just aren't ready for a black land ocal region
it's so interesting that you can get an idea of how good someone is at you know
objective criticism based on their opinion of the last jedi if they say it's good you instantly know
oh okay oh you like disney star wars okay all right so you like terrible things well i mean
this is the thing i mean there are like reasons people can like it and still you know they can
admit that it's a bad movie so i should i should qualify that's like i'm not saying that if you
like it you don't you can't pick out the flaws in it well the interesting part comes in that if you
have someone who's very critical of movies and they're like lj is you know it has its flaws but
it is pretty good you're like okay and then they come to like other movies with similar flaws you
like try and cross reference and see them be like yeah but yeah that's true exactly the most common
one you'll find is like yeah but tlg is a bigger movie that has bigger ideas it's talking about
bigger things this movie's just crap oh did people actually use that argument themes man
like all about them things are you kidding because from my mind if they're saying if they're dealing
with bigger themes that just means there's far more for it to fall from and to fall short of
and it really did and so that just means it's even worse if you're gonna say that was supposed
to be big grand and epic is like well that just means it failed harder i mean this there's a sort
of like unwritten understanding from people where i guess they would be like if your theme is um
what's it like to to to be in a relationship or something like that a relationship that's one-sided
it's like oh that's your theme throughout the movie that there's a lot of different characters
going through that sort of um journey or story whatever and then some other film is like we're
tackling the meaning of life so we're automatically bigger you know and it's like it's really about
how you do both of those it's not really yes exactly the theme doesn't mean spit it's how
you execute it if you actually pull it off and address the theme in any measure of satisfaction
or you know depict it accurately create some interesting questions and thoughts and stuff
like that is it's all about execution not just the fact that you attempted it
what's like in the olympics whenever you've got a dive or about to attempt to dive
what they're attempting to do will influence their their top potential score so the harder
that dive you can do the more points you can score but the more difficult it is to point it out
exactly exactly but even watching someone do a bomb can be more enjoyable
watching like a really big fat dude one-leggedly hop off if they could spit around go oh
as he lands into the water could be hilarious this is very true it's all about your point of
reference how what you're judging it against and what the movie is meant to be or trying to achieve
and stuff because you would think it's just funny last jedi it tries to be serious in some moments
or you know try and convey the epic themes of the other movies you know the great battle between
good and evil which is so undermined by the flippant humor and bad jokes and stuff throughout
the movie i mean if you're going for like an intense threat that this big you know giant
ship is coming to destroy the rebel base having a pilot do what type of joke did he do against the
thing your mama your mama jokes jokes classification would be your mama
why me i remember watching it being like you know that because it's right at the beginning
of the film so you're still like that was strange it's almost like a blip in in the straight line
you're just like oh that was that was unusual that they did that in this scenario
just their whole you know cause rebel alliance is on the verge of being destroyed
and there's no they're like he's not even worried he's just like your mama
as ryan johnson said about that scene he wanted to he wanted to inject a bit of monty python
that was just like monty python that's why everyone loves it
it's just we also saw hux as a comedy character didn't even thought hux was it
he always saw hux as a comic character it's like how
makes no sense i think solo was a little bit too early i don't i don't think that was well timed
and i think a little learn from that but i just i see so much anger and hate and fear
and fear fear fear like anger i get like you know i'm a little angry and i hate the last jerry
like that i and i feel that these are justified things okay uh but but fear i i fear for the
future of entertainment and hollywood that's where my fear lies okay there he goes justified i guess
i was really confused for a second i was like afraid of what afraid of what comes next maybe
maybe i don't i don't actually know jay jay said i hope you'll tell me this is just a
matter of him listing like what yoda says in code that's a two or three probably i don't know
oh wait episode two the whole hate leads to this leads to mayonnaise leads to honey
this is actually touching on a deeper pet peeve i have that actually is a deeper philosophical
kind of idea where people instantly associate hate with bad or immoral and no no no no hate
and most emotions in fact are neither good nor bad it's dependent on what they are focused on
for instance i think it's pretty good to hate rape just just putting that out there okay
no i love rape oh really love me i love me some raping how can we not reference the great
philosopher boogie 298 uh at least rapists believe in something oh my god
are you aware of this i can't believe that night when we found this
at least at least nazis and rapists believe in something how is that
oh
at least nazis and rapists are doing something they believe in the context makes it worse
he's talking about how bad internet trolls are and he says at least internet trolls aren't like
nazis and rape exactly and he's like you guys you guys want to see the destruction of channels you
don't believe in you know you're you're you know without a purpose beyond hurting people
you know at least nazis and rapists they believe in something yes it's amazing normally the more
context you apply to it the more you understand it it's the opposite with boogie the more context
the worse it gets well i feel sorry for the guy he like because that is such a gaff like yeah think
think about what you're saying let's just just think a little bit um but yeah so when people say
that there's too much hate in the world and we need more love it's like you like no okay hate
isn't inherently a bad thing if you're hating bad things that need to be end that it's good to hate
them okay hate rape hate murder hate evil okay and how about we not love you know these bad things
let's not love greed let's not love rape and all those things so the whole it's such a shallow
kind of virtue signal we need more love and there needs there's too much hate in the world
it's like no and it's perfectly fine to hate a horrible movie especially if the movie is actually
almost offensive in some of the ways it depicts certain things in the world and stuff i love
people on twitter that say they're sick of the hate and from now on they're going to be more
positive and first off you can't be on twitter and you're in downtown hatred on the building a
bit like i want to be more positive this time around yeah um yeah i was gonna say that came
up with just right because he said that um he's he's evolved as a critic to the point where he's
realized that if you're dealing with good content celebrate it if you're dealing with bad content
try and find the good because ultimately you don't want to take people's enjoyment of the bad
away because taking enjoyment out of the world is bad and it's very interesting because you're like
oh what about enjoyment of you know that's why i brought up that's why i brought up the holocaust
with dx right right that went well it's like what about people who enjoy the holocaust yeah
i know right just right took away took away his own job with that crap like yeah he's saying he
doesn't want critics in the world like he doesn't want people to judge things but he wants a youtube
channel judging things it was just such an odd well he said that he kind of uh his hobbit videos
where i think his big break originally and uh he said that if anybody stopped enjoying the hobbit
films thanks to his videos that's a bad thing and whereas my position is whatever happens happens
if they watch my video and their emotions have changed as a result that's what are we gonna do
that's that's how things go it seems like it's there's a desire to just abandon the concept of
quality like true quality what makes a movie good because if there's a bad movie you can't judge it
and then establish it as bad in other people's minds because everything must be valued because
someone worked on it like look i get that people it's the participation award everyone
may admire that they try but i'd rather people try and succeed instead of try and make mediocre or
bad even and the only way you can help people succeed honestly is by trying to establish what
is good and what is bad i mean when i started out writing right i needed to learn that the first
stuff i wrote was absolute trash like horrible stuff okay and the only way that i could do that
is by critical review honestly look and getting and getting really harsh honest feedback from
other people but thank goodness that happened because then i could get a little bit better
and after you know what i was like um 12 years 11 or something years of me working at it i was able
to write a half decent book and actually made you know a success out of it got a good bit of
amount of there's a good bit of money as well i'm all just saying so i said that was an
being critical right and and trying to improve and get better at stuff while but i just i i can't
stand this idea of a just abandoning what the uh pursuit of quality like you can't criticize it
well now that you've just said that i want to make you aware of a tweet from chris stuck
sorry about this shad with this oh i was just thinking of this i know what you're going to show
chris chris nothing personal nothing personal buddy but i mean i mean i'm sure you can disagree
with me do you want to read it out from ranks all right let's do it this is the link to the
full thing without the filmmaker there is no film critic the filmmaker takes all the risks
spending years in their life crafting something the film critic spends 90 minutes in a theater
and maybe a few hours in front of a computer even when we hate a film it's good to remember that
chris go fuck yourself what a worthless thing to say i mean i can kind of get that is saying
you can admire the effort people put into it but if he's trying to say as a result of that
you can't criticize it i was like no i doubt you saying that yeah um it's it's relatively
unclear what the overall specific statement is but i think the implication at least one of the
implications i got was that um the effort to make a film is always going to be greater than the
effort to make film criticism which i would disagree with so yeah well yeah i i'm i don't
i would say sure but some more yeah like dare i say subjective thing because i can
guess it depends on how much effort people put into a film versus how much effort people put into
technically we have a mathematical formula for work but yeah i mean you could quantify
the individual review based on the individual movie to you get you get directors who turn up
to set with a coffee and they're like go uh that'll be enough for today see you guys you know that
sort of like the lowest comment on it and then you'll have critics who are obsessed with getting
every detail right yeah i mean production value i've no way of knowing this i've no way of knowing
this but i i would hazard the assumption that perhaps i probably put in a bit more effort into
my book than the script of the last jedi i mean when you look at the script you just wonder how
much review did this go through like is this just something someone brain vomited onto a
you know the screen and just said yes let's do it i think christian go further back without
cinemas there would be no film so if your cinema's carpets covered in cum and they spit in your
popcorn don't complain he's implying it's like you know you need you need the them in order to have
let's just say us for the sake of this argument the problem is that a lot of filmmakers start
because of film critics yeah inspired and so it's this is just a really awkward tweet to me i'm just
like what are you trying to say are you upset that like some critics are a little bit um i don't know
of their own ass a bit maybe is that it and this taking thing it's like you artists create something
they want to create for fun and at the worst it gets forgotten and at the best it gets rewarded
and celebrated those risks there's a lot of filmmakers that make crap fucking films and
then they get more money to make more films like i just get sick of this risk-taking mentality no
no they want to be filmmakers they want to do something any artist that wants to do something
they're meant to be doing it for the love and if they get rewarded that's great but they don't
guarantee to reward interestingly all of us can definitely be a little bit pissed with that the
statement that the film critic spends 19 minutes 19 minutes in the cinema and then a few hours of
the computer is like maybe because we're not as lazy as you chris like i can't help but be like
chris you're the dude who does that okay not all critics give a shit because he wants to be a
filmmaker doesn't he yes he does actually yeah he wants yeah that's what i reckon he's just setting
up future when people come at him that he'd criticize things this is he's laying the groundwork
it's his safety net to say well come on i was on the filmmaker side all along he's made two
shorts if any of them are released publicly or at least available to sell we'll totally do any fat
movies i think let's test it out i tell you what that i tell you what just to give i guess a
perspective from the other side um when my book released there was no point in my life where i
felt more emotionally vulnerable than at that time and it was it was a eye-opening experience
because when you do make something that you put your blood sweat tears into um and then it is open
to uh the like just come you know everyone's thoughts the whole world is now open to criticize
it and stuff oh boy yeah it's a nervous it is a nerve-racking experience the problem is that
when you get criticism that's of really high production value it essentially
converts into a new form of creativity like a product or a
that's true and when i was saying that i'm not saying therefore people should not criticize
people's works or even my work because that's hand in hand that's part of the thing it's an
inf factual fact that's an essential part of creating something and trying to create something
good because if you did make something bad you do need to know about it and it's when people give
you the feedback that you know and i was lucky because the book has done really well but that
doesn't mean it's flawless people have been out of point out things that i could do better it's
like all right now i know when i'm writing the next book i know certain things that i can improve on
and i'm better for it um so yeah like yeah i just i guess it'd be hard to it's never occurred to me
ever to be like but i put so much work into it but i worked so long on it you must love it because
i worked so hard on it that's no that's not right it's just insane that's never even coming to my
mind as a defense it's like but i work so hard respect the fact that i took all those hours to
make something like the work that you put into it is is basically irrelevant it's just whatever the
final product is that's important you can appreciate commitment if you want to i mean it's up to the
person judging i guess but when you're trying to specifically judge the final product how much time
it took to make it is only going to be relevant to arguments in relation to how much time took to
make it you know what i mean like it's sometimes the whole amount of effort you know well for
example like if you look at something that has really bad special effects i just read something
in chat sorry i just read something chat where someone said hitler worked really hard too
that's correct yeah um yeah i was gonna say when you look at like really really old um low budget
movies or something and you find out like certain things just couldn't be done um people like
automatically expect you to take that into consideration in terms of you can't say it's
bad because there was never a chance of them being able to do anything else or something
it would just be well i mean in that instance you could say well it was good for its time
but because quality standards have improved if you're measuring it against the standards we
have in the modern day i'm sorry it doesn't hold up i think that's fair to say
i think that it all matters with uh contextualizing all of it and i just don't like the implication
that critics aren't creating dare i say it art themselves when i watched the plank of
videos on the prequels back in the day i was like holy shit this is a new type of of like
criticism video i have i watched it like a movie i was like what is going on here this is weird i
was entertained it was funny it had like a through line like a narrative and i loved the character and
the stupid skits like i was like what is happening you know it's got this is going beyond just
um recording a vlog we're like yeah i thought the movie was cool i like some of these bits i
didn't like some of these bits like this is a full-on art form now and then he gets critics
there'll be people responding like what we're doing right now like that's what efap is is
holding the critics to a critical light and we all get the same thing and so
could you then make the argument that like hey critic critics couldn't exist without critics
so you know the critic takes all the risk by putting the controversial opinion out there
and trying to get the right accurate information and order it all up and get the maybe guests or
production values all straight all you have to do is watch their video and then record a vlog for 90
videos where you just say oh i didn't like it yeah yeah it also seems to be a bit of a misplaced
value saying you know uh critics wouldn't exist without the filmmakers well no the film wouldn't
be successful without critics being willing to judge it hopefully on an objective stand and be
able to tell other people if it's good or not i mean like a lot of people rely on the critical
response depending on which not the rotten tomato squadron but the like audience scores
are just but like if you find someone you trust their opinion and they're able to say hey this
is a good movie you might want to check it out that adds value and that lets me know of something
that's good for me to watch that i didn't know previous to it and that has tremendous value you
could say movies rely on that kind of thing sometimes good word of mouth but they move the
goal post so much all every one of these guys that wants to sit here and talk about hate and the
haters will go to a screening of the room and cheer and clap and laugh and have a good time i think
yeah but those are bad movies first of all we'll probably say like you do have to appreciate that
Tommy Wiseau did try to make a movie but a lot of effort there and i should be like Chris come on
dude yeah like they're not standing up you know screaming at the crowd stop laughing this is he
put a lot of effort into this you know so it all comes down to what films they like whether you're
allowed to laugh and join in or not it seems to also be like a um extension of the cultural thing
where you can't have any losers okay in a race everyone's a winner okay because you can't make
people feel bad and stuff yeah and didn't cristog when rip into the prequels as well
but could we just make the argument back to him it's possible he's laughing at bad films too so
i like exactly i really appreciated his review on robin hood where he just openly said it's a
crap movie and i was like good when you see crap pointed out like
like how could you they took time on that film like makes you wonder what time like gosh
the dark side has taken over star wars fandom i'm serious the only people i really enjoy
talking about star wars with now are women fans that are into it now okay because all women are
the same i thought he said there's some balance out there that was interesting there you're not
getting laid dude what i have sexist he just thinks they were all the time i don't see the
connection of what he was talking about one thing and then now i can only talk about star wars with
fee with women are you saying there's not one guy on the planet that shares your same views about
star wars yeah he must have a lot of guy friends who may have seen this video and been like dude
hell this is crap i thought we were friends man
well i guess that's gonna be a good help thing as well i could only talk about stars with women
these days that is so loaded in many ways what he just said then if he is implying that only like
only men dislike this movie and if the movie is legitimately bad is kind of implying without
realizing that men are looking at this movie objectively and women are incapable or the women
he knows are incapable of looking at this movie objectively because they like it and men don't is
that what he's saying well he's he's gonna develop this i'm i'm i'm beyond curious um they could be
old fans or new fans you think you think you like talking about star wars with anna oh he probably
hate talking about it with her she's not the wrong i guess she's just the wrong kind of woman i guess
imagine she like explains all the problems with it that he goes but a woman you're you're actually a
trans i wonder if it from his perspective because he it seems like he likes star wars and last july
said he loves what disney is doing with it and so he might be thinking he's making a big compliment
to women is you know virtually again because it seems like women they get it they understand
why this movie is good and men don't so there you go women smart men stupid is that what he's saying
i i mean i'd have we have to wait for him to actually get close to something like that i
assume he's saying men are being too toxic that's the word people like to use we'll see oh you see
he's picked up line like is it is he trying to pick up with this does he think someone's got a
touchy touching because of this they put a hand on his shoulder and he's like
it happened it happened the entire day i got the touch it was everything that they said it would be
it's exciting i get to like talk about characters and it's fun and it's like oh this cool like
metaphor that you could look at or dissect this it's like oh yeah sweet like this is a lot of fun
but there are plenty of guys doing go talk to pop culture exactly jack same board there's
plenty of go talk to these beta males that his premise here is undefined
yeah it's totally undermined by the fact that i have fun with my movie there are guys that share
his same opinion and girls who viciously disagree with them and hate the movie too so
like it's that's debunked from the get-go here
yeah majorly eric taxon those people patricia taxon i find that when i'm talking with um some guys
in the real world uh you know at a comic book store or when i read comments on the internet
or twitter or whatever and it's just so negative all the time and you guys love the film this is
bullshit what are you talking about you would think like i'm starting to like get the impression
though that most people seem to dislike it like the larger majority have caught on to that yeah
this movie is just trash there are there are there are chambers dare i say echo chambers filled with
thousands of people who adore the film if i was to be completely honest i still think it's pretty
divided i don't i don't know about 50 50 but but in my experience yeah tlg because the comparison
i always try and bring up is a season eight game of thrones nobody liked it as far as i can tell
the few outliers sure but that's one where it would be like it's like 95 percent
oh with tlg 60 40 is probably as far as i would go in terms of hate love
well maybe it's my own echo chamber yeah like this is kind of just the impression that i get
from interacting with my own audience and uh most of my sorry the subscribers on my channel
don't like it there are a few that do but most certainly seem to just despise a movie but i don't
know maybe people who like swords are i think he said talking star wars is people like on twitter
that absolutely hate last jedi but then they'll get onto the ot and be talking about old characters
and the books and and loving it you know and getting right into it so like he said you know
he can't talk about star wars at all to any men like do you know it's one film that we mostly
hate how many men does he talk to is it like three and they were all from like a same group of people
were they us it's just this podcast he's like five dudes all hating and ruining star wars
so critical and it's always like comparing it to what you used to have and you know yeah weird we
do that when it's you know a sequel can you believe that yeah but mauler it's only a sequel
if you interpret it to be a sequel we might be covering that next week i would love that unless
was that from his video on you what was that i can't remember anymore i think that was his own
video yeah well no i think that was his video on me yeah totally a sequel if you unironically said
that have you heard that one right oh sorry uh shad have you heard that one i haven't i
it's only a brain is probably cool if you'd interpret it was that one person saying that
yeah it was quinton reviews oh of course professional film critic yeah yes
it's such a like i can't even you know i told like the average person that i imagine they'd be like
cool i mean the implication of that stand you hadn't seen the others watching it on its own
and trying to work out what the fuck was going on yeah the implication of that statement is
essentially objective reality doesn't exist then because you can interpret it and everything is
valid and soul interpreters like no no there is an objective reality i mean there is objective truth
oh yeah it's cast is the cast that's insane it really is insane you just the more you think
about it the more it's that's a head scratcher right there oh yeah that's the kind of that's the
kind of thought you just you just sit in the shower and think about for a few hours did you
see this weird tweet about himself where he was kind of like i'm he implies that he's better than
the quartering didn't he delete that oh did he i should have i'm i'm back hello freaking
10 minutes mate update me what happened yeah well i was with you absolute plague doctor why
how long how long was it like 25 at least oh okay sorry disgusting what what did i miss
we were just talking about quinton's hot take that his videos are better than uh the quartering
um i mean first off first off like why the fuck would you make a meme about yourself that's
positive that's just you don't do that did he i don't know he made the lead but he definitely
self posted it so it's just like well he shouldn't have done that it's fucking stupid i'll try and
find if you know i made it to you i think it's going to make a meme with so many levels yeah
going back to that concept right that um uh the whole subjective versus objective thing i think
it's it could be a matter of people just not really trying to break down what certain you know
concepts mean when they say everything is subjective i think there's a misunderstanding
something the truth that could be found in that is that no everything can be looked upon in a
subjective manner but that doesn't mean everything is subjective or undermine the objective reality
of certain things and so the statements can exist correctly together in the sense that
everything is actually objective there is an objective truth that undermines nearly everything
that i can think of and those objective standards can be viewed upon in a in a subjective way and so
everything can be viewed in a subjective way but that doesn't mean the objective truth is subjective
that's the disconnect and that's what i think people are like taking the the the concept that
everything can be seen in a subjective way then they take it way too far and say everything is
subjective it's like no no stop misunderstanding this concept well i mean how who the fuck actually
believes that everything is subjective is like the the real question that i have when i hear this
stuff like nobody believes that nobody deep down believes that like everybody knows that's bullshit
i know it makes me half want to go up and slap someone and they say you slapped me i was like
not from my subjective point no no in my opinion like what what you define as a slap i disagree
with what i did was a flop and that's what i did and that's my opinion and it's a good thing and
that's my opinion and you can't take that away from me it's like yeah this is not how the universe
works there are things that just are and aren't like i don't know what to say it is written in
history as a permanent fact that i just like i can't fucking you know it's like okay there's
gravity i can't just like will myself to fly like it's just that i'm not captain mark well
i'm not captain marvel but like you know it it's like okay so what does that tell us gravity works
in such and such a way something that i would like to do i cannot do it's impossible and that's not
my opinion it's not my judgment it's just the way it is and everybody knows that everybody believes
these things like nobody believes that everything is subjective well an interesting kind of qualifier
to try and understand the whole argument and i didn't mean to derail us onto this but i blame
mauler because he brought up the uh statement like how do not i pretend um like fringy you're
standing five meters away from me and in between us is a wooden cutout of the letter six now i push
it over and so when i look at it on the ground it is the letter six but you're five meters away
from me when you look at it it is the letter nine okay and then if you say this is the letter nine
this is an objective fact and i look at you and say no this is the letter six that's an objective
fact these two statements are both objectively correct but they're based on our different
perspective and that's i think is a very key point people need to try and figure out and realize
is what is the perspective that someone is uh using to base their judgment upon because if you
can figure that out you can then figure out the objective standard and the idea is that those are
two objective standards that contradict one another but are both correct based on it every chat wants
to tell you that those are numbers not letters yeah i uh i thought i i thought i was objectively
wrong i admit that i thought you were going somewhere with that because you said the
letter six and i was about to interrupt him like oh maybe this is part of it that was doing 3d
chess right there um but yeah no the whole idea with uh the whole idea without analogy of six and
nine is what we're trying to do is establish a common basis from which we can view you know media
storytelling so that we have like a common understanding of what it is and once we establish
the baseline we can go forward from there and the baseline should just be like what is a story
what is a plot like what are characters things like that exactly and people seem to take the
thing that because there are two different perspectives you can look and therefore judge
something by those it's all subjective and you can't officially establish whether this number
is a six or nine it's like no you absolutely can just figure out what the standard is the
perspective you're judging it by then absolutely but people don't seem to just follow the logic
through and they say i know i think the sun is a potard and that's my opinion uh theo's
asked a couple times he's asking what does everything is subjective mean and i'm assuming
both you would agree with this but the idea that there is nothing that is um that is definitive
everything is up in the air everything is no element of any discussion of anything in the
entire world because the english language was created by people language communication terms
were created by people and just the fact that we are we are limited conduits we are just these
fleshy entities that can only translate a portion of what reality in universe is so we're flawed at
the core of being able to say what is objectively in reality but it's just become the go-to for
stop talking i don't like what you're saying yeah it's not even that deep it's just yeah
everything's subjective so stop talking stop having an opinion yeah exactly and you know more
to the point if we're all flawed in the same way then that's fine now we can just go from that
point yeah we're all flawed in the same way so we're starting from the same place same common
ground it sounds like it's a semantic issue at that point i'd be like okay so we just need to
change what objective means in terms of it's not uh if there are things beyond our ability
to perceive then we're not including those we can't how do you even know they exist yeah
and the whole the you know everything is subjective is contradicted by the fact that
that is an objective standard you've just established yeah it is how do you know that
for all they know we are seeing reality to 100
if you include all the tools humanity has at its disposal and stuff not just our eyes because we
obviously know there are things our eyes can't see that are there um but how would we know something
is there without having known it was there already you know if you know what i mean like
we can't we we may discover a new additional plane or additional um the form of reality but
until we discover it we can't know that we haven't discovered it if that makes sense
i uh i also noticed that you were discussing chris duckman's because i was listening in the car
chris duckman's tweet about film i mean what i find funny about it is it just it just says a lot
about his process he spends 90 minutes at a theater and then a few hours in front of a computer
and that's what he does but other people put in more effort and time and like way to under
undervalue criticism as a part of storytelling i mean is is criticism not just like a fundamental
component of creating stories anyway because you had to criticize yourself if you combine his
statements with the idea that it's all subjective and we're just sharing our opinions then criticism
does become a little bit kind of meh who cares what's criticism useful why does he make videos
well making video i'm sure he sees sort of it's a fun it's a fun thing to do yeah while while
filmmaking is much more serious endeavor with a lot more effort and risk criticism is just you
know you know just sharing your opinion they are the masters of the universe we are merely the
critics the slaves the dirt pushers the shit pilots at the bottom is like feasting on the
that's the thing though like when i read this all i can think is you're trying to pander to
the crowd that you want to be part of you want to make movies so you want to distance yourself from
the shit things you've said about other movies because you don't want to cut yourself out from
the industry also like nice to meet critics because remember i said that thing so and also
like i'm i'm sure that he said that some movies are just complete shit what does he said that
about the new robin hood movie he just ripped it apart it was like what what if he sat down
yeah well i mean i don't i don't really like any of his reviews personally but
the thing is um you know what like that that that's that but if he sat down in the room with the guy
who made that movie i think you'd buckle i think you'd buckle immediately i think you just pull
back and not and not stand by what he said because he doesn't want to piss anybody off
because he wants opportunities to make movies that this this is what i mean this is why it just
seems so cynical to me it's like hey guys i'm one of you two i'm a filmmaker too guys like me it's
like fucking criticism is part of filmmaking holy shit it's symbiotic fucking hell well he does say
only part of filmmaking if you feel in the second part of the tweet he says that it's a symbiotic
relationship but he goes on to then say that you have to respect each other and i'm like whoa
no you don't why do you have to respect each other you don't why and this this comes down to
again how different different people look at respect in different ways how it's how it's
provided or earned etc what it means all right there's also an implication there yeah but there's
also an implication where what is there an idea that if you dislike something therefore you do
not respect the people who make it you can dislike something and still respect whoever made it and
you could dislike something and not respect the person who made it as well they these don't
contradict one another it's actually very true well the thing is it's like of crazy why they
tied together why why the fuck are they intrinsically linked as though like surely it
should be apparent that when you're criticizing a film you're not actually criticizing like the
character of the person who made it necessarily the thing is people take criticism as attacks as
their personal attacks yeah uh that's that's their prerogative to do that i know but it's
wrong it's wrong people shouldn't take things like that personally it depends if somebody's
validate their feelings like like if somebody if somebody were reviewing your book shad and
they're like this book shit and shad shit fuck shad it's like that's you know i agree i agree i
yeah exactly but but if someone said but a lot like there are some you know one or two reviews
that are like they do they hate the author they think i'm being a pretty evil thing um and so
they just lost the plot but then there are other people say i really like shannon like his content
uh and but i didn't like the book and so that you know that's a perfect example of people
respecting the person who made it but disliking the thing most of the reviews are overwhelmingly
positive so that's really great and that that's like the best ever and i think that's that's the
risk reward thing about creating anything okay is you're risking a huge amount of investment of
time and stuff um and money in the hopes that you would get the payoff of people liking it
but that doesn't mean that people have to like it because you work so hard on it no no uh it's the
goal is relevant you could work like not hard on something at all and make something really
good like the time is not important it's it's and and this is the thing like a lot of people
who work in creative industries well yeah exactly i mean the reality is just i slapped it together
in 10 minutes and it was hilarious that fucking boogie leave rags we lost our shit with that one
we actually did lose our shit i have i i'm still looking for my shit that i lost
are you talking about the what the thing that he said
yeah beat baited to uh a little a quick beat oh yeah i i do love that one you know at least
rapist and murderer at least rapist and nazi's believe in something it's like wow good job it's
true they did believe in something good job boogie you said it true um yeah i was gonna bring up by
the way to to try and give him the best benefit of the doubt the risk he must be referring to
outside of money when making something is the risk of people disliking it because if there is no
like potential for creating something awful it's only that you create something that people may
not like um you'd write you wouldn't necessarily want to and i guess that um criticism is still
useful in that he could look at the vast majority of it and see what most of them are looking for
and then make something that appeals to it but again that doesn't seem like but i'd be like
you know you shouldn't try and make something just like according to everyone's specifications
if you know what i mean like i don't know if that's where it should originate from
also yeah it's pretty much impossible there is a hard reality that comes into criticism
that i think is you know perfectly valid and important but it is a hard reality that a lot
of creative types need to kind of be aware of if they're going into it and it's the fact that
like say uh the best example i can give is my book not like i'm trying to always reference it
but say i wrote my chat wrote a book everyone i wrote a book people lies so it was legitimately
bad it was legitimately bad he put his own name into the title yeah and this is the thing right
like all the reviews one star even like as people hating it and it was legitimately bad
just because i really want to be a writer and an author doesn't mean i should okay and the hard
reality is that maybe this might not be the best thing for you to pursue yeah i think good at it i
think that's uh i think i'm glad you actually mentioned that because that's the kind of thing
that uh like what what i mull over often when i'm working on something i'm like this fucking shit
fuck this this is piece of shit like the question that you need to ask that you should be asking at
some point is now i would like to do this i would very much like to do this but am i going about it
the right way do i have the potential to do it i mean this is the same questions that people ask
it's like i want to be an astronaut it's like have you studied physics have you studied mathematics
do you care to do you think that it's something that you can do are you of enough mental fortitude
that you could last in complete isolation for several months potentially like if you're going
on a mars mission it's like no okay well yeah okay you don't cut out for it you don't cut out
effort you want to do it but that doesn't matter exactly and this is exactly the same as
writers and even movie makers and stuff the desire even as pure and virtuous your desire is
to be a filmmaker anything does not make it that you deserve to be successful you might be good at
it yeah you might and and look if my book was really really bad and everything like that
you know i could say all right i'm going to work at trying to get better and that's good
okay oh that's a good you know i'm a goal but there should be a time in which you might need
to realize if it's even possible for you to get better at what you're trying to be successful at
if you're not improving and you just completely just regurgitating crap it might be time for you to
reassess your life goals try and find something that you're good at and then try and be successful
like that um and then and start out on it because that's what it seems to be it seems to be like
people are making a lot of crap movies and people are saying no because they worked hard on it you
can't criticize like no okay the hard reality is we would probably want the people making bad movies
to stop making bad movies so we get good movies i mean how hard your work is irrelevant it's um
that's just not important it's um it's something that you can definitely take into account you
know like after the fact you can be like yeah you worked hard but it doesn't impact the quality
of the actual work it's um you know somebody could spend one minute making something and it's really
good somebody could spend their whole life making something and it's not good i was like yeah i can
appreciate that you worked hard but that's not that's not what we're talking about we're talking
about the actual product divorced from that it's just it's just not relevant yeah most things
people work hard on like movies and tv shows and stuff that doesn't it's not a factor
with any art form it's the finished product that's all that should matter you shouldn't
know anything else about the creation of it really like because if it's good it's good
if it's bad it's bad i couldn't give a fuck how long you spent on something because it makes no
difference in the well that's an important point because there are some people who are just
insanely talented that they don't need to put nearly as much effort into creating something
as other people do and what they make is so much better and it was so easy for just because it was
easy for them to make doesn't devalue what they made you judge it basically true quality that you
know ryan johnson thinks he's one of those people he thinks that first draft will do
and we all saw the result of that so some people should put some more effort in
instead of telling us that you know one draft
are you optimal uh i believe mema sorry about mema's is australian so you got the four of you
now that one that's great i like that i like it a lot that is a lot
i have to say this is pretty awesome as well i think you'll like this yeah there you go that's
a good one six it's nine but it's so appropriate to the concept that's being talked about
that's great i love it it's actually it's an a
yeah you could push for an a just yeah it could be an a that's right
there we go and then uh gavin manro i think i he mentioned i'd missed this one previously it was
just a little piece of work for wolf i will try and pass it on it's quite nice
that's cool um and yeah we should probably back to the video oh yeah we got a video don't we
cool guy you're the problem he's so enthralling we can't we forget we're even watching him
of when you were 16 okay it doesn't mean they were the best it's just because you were at that
age where it it was the best or you're in a position in life where it is the best and it's
okay if star wars isn't the same anymore it shouldn't be yes that's my issue is that it's
you know we don't care if it's the same we care that it's different and it's shit and it's funny
those other films came out when everyone was 16 like that it was loved around the world because
everyone was at that certain everyone everyone in the world was 16 we've aged different only 16
year olds liked it that's right by the way empire and a new hope and not the same no yeah very
different some might argue they're ghastly different vastly different and it's like and
it's like is also implying that when kids like something that means it doesn't like it isn't
good like like is that wouldn't I I think because kids can like something that is actually
legitimately good that adults would like as well it's yeah absolutely yeah
it wasn't and what's the same should it be like the prequels should it be like the
he just he just presented a counter argument to himself like what even is the same this is like
same as what old trilogy it's it's going to be different and it's going to change and grow and
not do things you want because you don't get to write it because you're not a filmmaker okay
we dislike it because it's different no we dislike it because it's bad no it's because
you're not a filmmaker sad you're not a filmmaker okay you're not a filmmaker it's like I can't
stand these people that just set up stupid straw man's like this and say this is how
people act again you're dumb because come off that I don't write it's frustrating
there's either what we got or what's in your head yeah and you didn't get that so this is the only
other option exactly oh I just I just like are you a filmmaker this guy you disliked it because
it was different yeah and that's okay but there's just this attack on the internet the internet men
being anonymous man internet whoa man probably are you know women who dislike the movie too
I would imagine you know no no no it seems unlikely they're all men all the 100% of the
replace men with literally any like of the other way well I was gonna say any way to have them
liked because white would be okay too but put put Asians in there put Jewish people in there
it was like a bunch of black people just don't like this film a bunch of women just don't like
this film it's so fucked up isn't it I hate this it's it's so wrong like it really upsets me it
bugs me it's actually sexist he's automatically defaulting that everyone who dislikes this movie
is a man that is such a sexist mindset yes it is and women should be offended by that mindset
as well I think a lot of women are offended by this if they didn't like the movie they're
womening wrong it's more offensive to women because he's just putting them all in one
why he's doing it to men too we're all the haters that Star Wars girl was here she'd just be like
this is bullshit that is what I think is really ruining Star Wars because your opinion doesn't
matter let's discuss how does it mean your opinion doesn't matter like in reference to what
and how and how does something matter if it's box office if you're talking about box office returns
then yes the opinions of Star Wars fans matter a lot yes it does there are youtubers that if they
give a glowing thing they can get them a whole bunch of sales like the the opinion surely matters
even if it's to a small degree it surely matters of course it matters I mean who are you making
these films for I mean I reviewed Alita Battle Angel for the express sorry express purpose of
trying to get more people to see it and it worked okay that was you know an opinion that had an effect
imagine when episode nine comes out that all five of us release a video as extended that talks about
the amazing quality of Star Wars episode nine you really think we wouldn't get at least one ticket
sold between us is like I think so and then I think Disney would it would be like oh that looks
like that how can you say this would Disney have people paid to come out and watch these films and
then report on them as a good thing the whole scholarship with Collider it's like what's the
matter and yeah the thing is even opinions that don't have huge you know far-reaching influences
or anything like even just mild influences and stuff it doesn't invalidate the opinion like if
the opinion is for the individual of course it matters it's based on their own feelings and
opinions it might not matter to other people but this is a very interesting and loaded statement
yeah I'm just curious you know it's matters to watch slash who that's what I'd be curious about
well yeah what does he mean by that it's like what does he mean when he says it doesn't
matter it doesn't matter to who so the universe is good opinions matter because the good opinions
matter to him clearly but bad opinions those don't matter you're only allowed to like things you can't
not like this is what I mean he's a fucking hypocrite if opinions don't matter then fuck
your opinion I don't care what you think I'm assuming he's gonna say his doesn't either
let me just roll it back see oh yes because your opinion doesn't matter okay it doesn't
it you probably haven't even seen the movie what
so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and I'm very disappointed
you probably haven't even seen the movie okay we hate the movie you mustn't have seen it
more with nobody could watch it and not like it it's that amazing what the hell
maula without seeing it you really guessed correctly what happened you did an amazing job
of filling those hours by guessing because you obviously didn't say it well I mean see no planet
I think that's most people guessed that um like kamikaze to save the world with it and most people
guessed that luke being a coward how could you not see that coming like that's pretty much just
a logical progression we all guessed that what a strange thing to say like you know when people
like really hate something and I think they might be off the mark the last thing I'll accuse them of
is you never even watched the film to begin with it's like of course they did they hate it because
they watched it he's saying they hate it they haven't seen it you couldn't have possibly seen
it like getting getting things wrong sure because everyone's gonna get shit wrong I'll get shit
wrong but like not seeing it what are you like why would he think that they haven't seen it what
if they've said things about the film like as that are in the film they just I guess they just
it's from a trailer or they guessed right or this is this is the most retarded thing like
I can't believe we all guess there was a rose character
and that she'd be worse than Jar Jar Biggs we all guessed that well what what is the time this
video came out maybe it's like right after it came out or well that's I mean it's not that's
not even a defense it's just maybe he thinks that it's so so soon afterwards that no one's actually
seen it or darkness said imagine how long ball this video would have been if he'd seen the film
I think he's referencing the um the score people putting on rotten tomatoes of if they were excited
to see a movie which they then later removed the only thing you could possibly justify this with
there's a hate train and some people join it whether or not they've even seen the movie
and there are some people sure I'm sure there's some out there there's not a people who yeah
like people who hate it falls awakens and refuse to support disney they might say yeah episode
episode it sucks like have you even seen it and go I've watched reviews but conversely there
might be people who are of the opposite view who haven't seen the movie but are just on its side
yeah like I don't need to see it I just know that I trust disney as as this guy has said
it's like I like disney's stalls I want to see whatever you if you have seen the movie great
don't see the next one that's not so that's how opinion matters is is that what he challenge
accept it the thing is logic there is if you have an opinion you probably haven't seen it don't see
the next one then your opinion will matter what if someone said I hated force awakens for what
they did to Han Solo but I will absolutely see episode eight because I love Luke Skywalker
what would you say then these arguments are shit mauler yeah I yeah I'm not sure what to say
like the idea is like if you don't like it don't watch it people say though game of thrones they
were like why are you guys watching it if you didn't like episode three why watch episode four
five and six like because I want to know what the fuck happens exactly you don't know if it's going
to be bad before you go into watching it that's the whole point of watching it in the first place
because we're often hyperbolic about it but episode nine could be good it's just a really
low fucking percentage chance well I mean it would be so difficult to make it good that I'm
reserved to believing that it won't be good yeah and I don't think there's anything wrong with
saying I believe it will be a bad film um and I'm gonna go see it for you can have all kinds of
well I mean the thing is you know how like in the several times I think I'm gonna love to
and I enjoy you know you know how like in video game discussions a lot of the time people say
things like this game is oh that really dumb it wow that was like a perfect cutout this game
what did he say the other that's true the game is it's the uh you can hear me now right yeah
yeah uh the the common thing with us they're like this game is going to be game of the year
and like they don't know that and I kind of find it annoying when people say that but nobody really
gets on someone's back for saying I think this game will be good but when you say I think it
will be bad they're like you haven't even played it yet you haven't even watched it yet it's like
yeah but do you think there's a reason why I'm coming to this conclusion I mean what is the point
of promotional material if not to make you form a judgment of something you know based on that
promotional material I'm thinking we were talking about earlier the whole like you're allowed it's
much everyone's much you're allowed to have positive opinions yeah yeah so people who are
like oh I can't wait to play this game it's gonna be so good it's like you haven't even played it
yeah you don't you don't catch that that often but you do catch plenty of oh I fucking this game
looks terrible it's like you haven't even played it well I think death stranding is a good example
of that nobody knows what that game is nobody knows what it's about and if you say like I'm
not really that interested it's like oh come on this stupid you haven't played it it's Kojima he
only makes good games you know god I was like that's yeah that's that's not a very good argument
but you know you can get a good idea of if the game is going to be good or bad based on you know
that's the point that's the whole point of promotional material that's the point
that's why it exists like this is why I don't know what do you do I don't know
oh okay imagine going through the world that week like he's saying you can love star wars
your whole life but if you go see a film that shits all over it and you hate don't say anything
because that doesn't matter well you know you just give it up on the entire franchise you should
stop watching it because you hate it yeah how are we supposed to just walk away and be quiet
he's like supporting the idea yeah because like you know we just said it's theoretically possible
we could have eleven teen I'm making up a number for this eleven teen bad movies from Disney star
wars and then the next one's good I could happen and if you love the content of star wars and you're
holding out hope is that not reason enough to go see it you just admitted you're like you know I
really want this to be good I really like star wars and if you just give up yeah well apparently
you're like you don't even like no matter so why bother it's like oh I don't know see I'm almost
like that with star wars now like the last jedi ruined so much that the continuity now is just
broken and anything building off that continuity like then like a next movie even if it's good
it's trying to say that therefore what actually happened in that last movie really did happen
and I'm not sure I can allow this I uh my my thing with star wars is I'm now basically only
interested in side stories or like other things nothing to do with the main story that's why I'm
interested in the Mandalorian that's why I'm interested in like the side content but I I've
lost all investment in like the main saga as it were because as much as I would like to pretend
that the new movies aren't canon they are so it's ruined by any meaningful like of what canon is
outside of your own personal take on what canon is like yeah it's canon well yeah I can't change
the official status but like I will never you know buy the last jedi or anything right you can think
and like I'll just think of the expanded universe the uh the you know the stories with Luke and all
in the books and stuff I'll say that's that's that's uh how star wars should have gone well
yeah it's so that's yeah you have disney giving uh the writing to let's just say
someone we typically have a lot of faith in and then a director we have a lot of faith in people
who care about source field and they talk publicly about how they're going to do a story that's
completely unrelated to everything we've seen the movies previously but it's still in the star
world universe I'd be like all right give me a good trailer and I'm game because I like star wars
um that doesn't mean I just because under disney doesn't automatically mean it'll be a disaster
and I should never try and no I uh I'm kidding Mandalorian I'm quite keen on the Mandalorian
I think it looks cool I like me some space bounty hunter stuff and the people are attached to it
you know pretty decent yeah pretty good track record I don't know what's gonna happen same for
the MCU right now I'm like hmm yeah well because you got like tiger with TD which is you know a
good sign he's doing some a lot of people are hating but uh because a lot of us yeah a lot
because of uh that movie saying he'll crap on um what canon or what's been established
oh yeah he said he doesn't care about um wasn't it with uh Norse mythology he said he's gonna
uh I mean Norse mythology is not very well respected in like Thor canon anyway in like
the MCU so let's not be fair and everything but there's no need to be like I don't give a shit
no uh it's yeah it's um well imagine if like you know they're making god of war and they're
like yeah fuck Norse mythology we're setting it in you know Norse mythology but first getting it in
Jamaica man the god of war come for you um I mean I I still like tiger with TD anyway just because
I like I like Thor Ragnarok a lot and if it's like Thor Ragnarok I'll probably enjoy it if you
could pick me off my ass off then I'm game I guess uh I guess the thing with the MCU phase four is
it's like what what are we really looking forward to like what what's on the horizon that's really
exciting from that um mainly like Thor and um what are the other movies that are coming out so
we got Black Widow Eternals um and then Doctor Strange yeah yeah Doctor Strange that might be
interesting I like that they brought um Scarlet Witch into that movie yeah I'm really keen on
that it seems like a good pairing that might be interesting to watch does anyway back to the
video yeah we better get back to that that's when your opinion can matter is when you don't use your
purchasing power to not purchase now it is stop stop that's not a good argument we've seen
we've definitely seen opinions without money change influence things this is just referred
to youtubers again they could go and pay the movie like five times but they still wouldn't
compare to the amount of thousands they might stop from seeing is that what he's saying though
is he's saying that if you don't like it you can just not watch it and that would affect and that's
yeah he's implying that that's what you should be doing instead of hating and not talk about it oh
once you don't like something just abandon it this is the thing like i'm sorry but i don't know
about you guys but in terms of franchises and series the mcu how many times do we watch a movie
in the mcu and go oh that was bad i hope the next one's better like that sort of thing yeah
i i would like to reference captain marvel we were all hoping oh i hope endgame is good
because it's trying to say if it's bad don't watch it but you need to watch it to determine
if it's bad i mean that's if you don't want to go off the you know critical response and things
like that but generally i avoid listening to our critics oh sorry reviews and stuff to a movie i'm
intending to watch because i want to you know see it without any you know preconceived opinions in
my head and so what he's saying just won't work it's just yeah but also even if we don't go no one
goes the next movie it loses money ryan johnson is still a cunt he's still fucking raped mark hamill
like so we we want to let him know that just not going to the next film doesn't explain that to
them yeah well it's just um you know it's apathy it's just like people are losing interest it's
not people were absolutely insulted yeah and if success in the box office was the thing that
determined if a movie was good well then all the transformers are brilliant same with captain
marvel and it's like no you think that what people thought of a movie would be important
and he's implying that it isn't important which is absurd i'm of course it matters also opinions
are worthless it's like oh unless it's hard to play but all right what would be the reverse um
so he's saying like your opinion matters when you stop paying for it does is the reverse of
that your opinion matters if you're paying for it as well as in it's the affirmative and then like
denying it if you know like he's almost implying that money is the thing that matters so if you
continue to supply money to the franchise that is your opinion mattering still correct
this is very pretty cynical well yeah no but not just that but it contradicts himself like
because he's trying to say that if we continue to watch this franchise despite hating it
we're spending money on it so that means our opinion matters still it just doesn't matter in
the way that we would want it to according to him but it would still matter this is what i mean
it's all very confusing he's saying we have to send him broke he wants us to send him broke
we don't like this is so bizarre like i i think of the video game industry and how many times
people saying yeah this is bad change it has affected things without having to do anything
with money you know like what is patches if not listening to player feedback and implementing
changes it's not based on the wallet it's not based on monetary statistics i mean the influence
for doing it is monetary but the actual opinion is you know relevant for informing it i this is such
a shallow interpretation of like communication all that matters is your wallet is it weird it's
a weird take i don't even know that he would stand next to it if he really like refined this
well he should have written a script he shouldn't have just said this and then uploaded it
but he went through editing and was like yeah this is good well infant is your criticism couldn't
exist without him having made this video and taking the risk on it yeah that's right appreciate
that i i respect you i respect you uh me so fly whatever it says on his stupid shirt
discussion or critical analysis of their next failings and successes of the characters
yeah i don't think people just not it's not where the bead goes leave us leave us alone
rag some people just don't like shaving their necks okay it's not like that shave your neck
this is i'm gonna be the jukem peter fin of this shave your neck okay i'll show you i'll go shave
my neck we'll be happier in your life shave your neck bucko also don't buy lando carision funko box
that's what i do that's what i have friends do that's what i go on to other shows and talk about
and do that's enjoyable that's fun and so that's enjoyable and if it's enjoyable it's good i was
just thinking so what if i tell you that the reverse is fun for me happens yeah what if we
have fun talking about how shit it is yeah it feels like everything's falling apart now it's
like oh no fun who we would have thought fun was subjective who would have damn it
and and there's a lot of men that i talk about star wars with but i'm just enjoying the conversation
there's no hate why even say that there's no hate like is he are you serious that country he just
said what when he talks about it with men that they all hate it and it certainly seems like he
can talk about it with women imagine being that kind of person i can only talk to insert
bite you know race or gender here about movies of being like racist in different ways that
we're not even totally aware of like either you say you are kind of racist or you're unaware of
it that's like often they take and i just be like you didn't get the you're so quick to judge man
as an entirety is kind of like you got some prejudice you need to sort out there buddy
well the thing is it's like clearly to him the gender of people is relevant when discussing
media whereas for me it's not relevant i don't it's not important because why would it be it's
you can't choose it it doesn't affect your brain are you saying you can't choose your gender
that is sorry fuck sorry i that's what i mean i don't even know what i'm allowed to say anymore
but he was like well they probably mad if they hate it they just don't realize it
okay i don't realize it i just don't realize it
and ironically yeah there's not there's no contradiction in there
i guess in the way that they view the world in there
literally if i like leet or l337 sorry i have to defend because that's a
you should feel ashamed of yourself too so if someone tells me they like it and i ask them why
i'm expecting them to be able to draw something of a reference from l337 if they tell me i cannot
i have good feelings in relation to watching her and i cannot tell you anything further than that
i'd just be like all right then but maul are you saying the words why is an attack
isn't it hacking you someone should have to explain myself and i see it in the reverse
if i tell someone something and they don't want to probe it whatsoever and they'd rather just go
be like okay yeah you know like sorry that i wanted to pursue your perspective
sorry that i tried to explore how you came to your perspective instead i should have just said
hmm you can't help but molly you're a man
that's the thing though is it's like um you know is it not interesting to figure out why people
like things like i'm more interested in the why and the how as opposed to the conclusion in the
same way that i think most people are you know more concerned with the working rather than the
conclusion you know it's the same reason why when you when you're doing a test they want to know how
you got the answer
what's this what's that you posted somewhat someone sent me that in discord
and i'm not shocked in any way when men complain about mary sue you 100 always look dumb twice
first you hate women second you don't understand how to follow story narrative that you can't see
yourself in uh wait a second just of course i don't complain about in a mary sue i'm not perfect
what kind of counter argument is that you hate women i love that part you hate women
you know what i'm just gonna have to copy that word for word if i could
it's such a disingenuous argument that they can't argue things so their ultimate response
is you hate women because of this opinion but just take it mary sue and replace it with
shit character you didn't quote mary sue the punctuation's all wrong it's just like when
men complain about mary sue you 100 always look dumb twice were you like who yeah yeah
use some commas use some commas man like commas are your best friend use them
but this is the interesting thing about these statements he's trying to say that
a certain statement establishes certain facts when he's unaware that his statement is establishing a
very prominent you know fact about his own mindset and it's that he can't argue with people who
disagree with him he would rather demonize and vilify them by saying you hate thing
why does he have to presume what they think you know like why is it what's the presumption of where
they think that's the only way the argument works it's it's being intellectually dishonest it's not
having the confidence or even the uh you know intelligence of being able to argue with people
just you know in a debate just talking about pros and cons facts different points of what
validates different views uh and because generally uh people lose those types of arguments if you
have a stronger one on your your own side they rather avoid the issue and demonize you instead
because if you're a bad person that means your opinions are wrong right because it's easy to
engage with someone who you assume is a bad person than it is to engage with somebody who
you don't make that inference and you just treat their argument like it shouldn't be about the
person making the argument that's the main thing yeah you know like what if they do hate women what
does that have to do with the argument like what does that good so then we don't have to engage
with them i was going to try and correct it to make it sound better and i was like oh no i can
just read this out because i'll just sound like a dumbass it'll be great he's perfect i wouldn't
want to take it away from this guy thank you very much what a terrible take but doesn't surprise me
considering this video yeah character why does not me like the character i didn't like bobofet i
never got like why why why is he you can like whoever you want sure that's irrelevant we're not
we're not talking about that if you decide to dislike a character because someone points out
issues with the character then like that's you chose that that was your decision no if you don't
like bobofet you hate men how does it like genuine question is it when he talks to women he says i
don't like bobofet from from the ot and they go oh i uh i do like the tlj though and they go
um not a fan of jojo binks
and then he comes away like that was a great conversation we really got to explore a lot
did the guy we're watching in the video is he the one who made that tweet yes yeah so based on his
own logic right it would be as justified to say to him because he doesn't like bobofet he must hate
men oh yeah that's that's that's the exact same logic is using there there's nothing he can do
i'm sure does he not know that gary stew is a concept though is he not aware of what a gary
stew is that exactly there's a full male equivalent to the mary's yeah i mean it's criticized as much
when it's just as bad it's just as bad it's just that we haven't been seeing it as much lately
like it's just not been as common depending on the critic as well some people will refer to
male characters as mary stu's i've seen people talk about harry potter being a mary stu
wesley from star trek next generation is hugely criticized as being a really annoying gary stew
character who's perfect in every way and uh is it annoying characters because it's again perfect
example of the gary stew i i think i think i find the gary stew one interesting because
er made a video where he he presented the argument that gary stu's are often not as bad
as mary stu's and his arguments i can't remember exactly what they were but one of them is that
gary stu still had to work for it like so for example john wick is a gary stew but he always
has to work for the the victory at least in the first movie like it's never easy for him
whereas with ray it seems to be pretty effortless yeah well this is the thing there are ways to
make gary or mary stu's um uh workable yeah like yeah look at cavote from the king killer
chronicles name of the wind he's essentially a pretty strong um you know gary stu but he makes
so many mistakes and his own kind of confidence and arrogance works against him in so many ways
that it works beautifully and as an acceptable character because the idea of a prodigy character
is just really talented and a lot of things can be a very workable character like yeah
but you need to justify it or work it in give us some weaknesses you have them be challenged make
them fail all these things and then it can come off brilliantly and so that can be applied to
female mary susan male you know gary stu's equally the clarification um the people in chat so
gary stu and mary sue are actually like depending on your sources can have different traits um some
people see gary stu as the male version of mary sue some people see gary stu as it will
be applied to males typically but they tend to have a different set of attributes um not entirely
dissimilar but again i'm not sure i'd have to check definitions well to me they're equivalent i
always use them you know yeah i i use them as equivalent well you just explained that er didn't
and that you agree oh yeah no er has i i found it interesting i'm not sure if i agree with it
because i think uh i think the things that he says probably make them not a gary stu at that point
and if they have to work for it you know then they're not a gary stu i don't think and i don't
think that applies to say wesley crusher one of the stronger gary sus people point out in pop culture
from you know star trek next generation at least he's not a cunt in real life right well uh actually
i how about how about if we go because we we already know who we would cite as mary sus but
what about a list of gary stu's like what what could we cite as a list of gary stu's and by that
you mean male mary sus yeah yes yeah that's strictly mary sus that are male i don't know but
yeah okay uh yeah no let's uh yeah what do you reckon well one punch man but the problem is
yes a lot of people include in the definition of mary sue that all the characters love them
ah then that makes it basically impossible does not apply i can't think of many well yeah because
even bakat hates wesley until that's that's what i mean i can't think of many male characters who
are beloved by everybody and you could you can then be like well captain marvel isn't beloved
by everybody and i'd be like yeah so there are things here that scroll you have no never mind
well i'm just gonna say you have to do a few concessions because uh if you stuck 100 to the
definition of a mary sue you might not be able to apply it to barely anybody um uh well i guess it
would be the majority of the protagonists right it would be the qualifier yeah i think it does apply
to captain marvel because most characters have a positive outlook on here for the most part yeah
um there's not many people who hate it by comparison one punch man there's not many
people who like him at all no except like genos and uh yeah um who else well there's the other
element we don't typically talk about superman yeah but superman has kryptonite like he has that
he has weakness don't get me started on kryptonite actually yeah no i mean i i think superman is
probably the best example of uh of like because he's just got all the powers um and he's referenced
kryptonite because the whole reason it exists is to try to prevent the title of mary sue yeah the
interesting thing about superman is the the strongest superman stories are completely
constructed around his mary's humanity of being perfect that he is so powerful so perfect and
then it's the contrast between him and humanity and bringing in stories where he uh is conflicted
in a different way and so that's kind of a feature not a detriment and that's what i mean
you can make mary sues male mary sues garry sues whatever i'm getting terminology is all annoying
now um you can make them workable okay it's i'm not saying it doesn't but there are examples when
they're not workable and they're very poorly executed well i think uh i think the the through
line is that gary stu's and mary sues are workable when you're making a story that criticizes that
aspect of them like uh like one punch man he works because it's a criticism of the unnecessary
nature of like the big climactic fights in anime and stuff because it just doesn't matter he wins
by the way that's worth mentioning and this is this is not important for captain marvel but it
is important for ray a lot of people like to specify that it's not that they can do everything
or anything it's that they they happen to have they can solve all the plot problems basically
whatever problems present themselves in the plot they can solve them
for example ray can't um i don't know she she wouldn't be able to swim down to the bottom of
a pool of lava to collect something for somebody as far as we know maybe she could put a force field
you know what i mean like uh she has she's supposed to have limitations the idea being
that it's like she's not a mary sues she's not a powerful superman or something like that i'd be
like oh yeah it's not necessarily that he is a god it's not a relative thing yeah
yeah is that every problem is presented in the fucking force awakens she overcomes it and we're
not talking about a couple of mechanical problems it's like there's a shit-tut of all kinds of
problems and yeah theo's saying it's about how the world responds to the character if you ask me
this is the problem there's a couple of definitions the the the original one included it's an author
insert right so there's supposed to be connections from the character to the person who wrote them
as if they are putting themselves in there having every character in these in the story like them
and they're able to overcome the problems of the world which is something that i think we could all
agree is something we would like to have as an attribute that we could solve all problems but
you don't but in your own fiction you could and all writers might be inclined to let that slip
out they might be like oh yeah i could solve this one because i'm pretty i'm pretty talented
um but yeah i think i think people are getting a little bit annoyed because like there's a lot
of different definitions at the same time that uh could be conflated yeah but this is this is the
value of discussion is figuring out where where it's a why why are people discouraging discussion
this is great i love this shit well most of what we just did was an attack in fit uh right and you
know it doesn't matter what we think doesn't matter you attacked shad shad attacked me like
it was it's all an attack it's all an attack so attacked i need to bandage my wounds my hurt
feelings you know a bunch of people put it's like kick jay what did jay do
it's not even happening done what has it he dug your way back to this wonderful man
oh yeah of boba fat uh i didn't go around criticizing everyone for liking boba fat i
didn't be like you were dumb and ugly because you liked it you didn't have a good reason
like you boba fat what is going on have you guys ever met anyone who actually says
someone is dumb and ugly for disagreeing with your opinion about a movie who says that i would
i think that i've seen comments like in there you know done ironically and stuff but like someone
who legitimately thinks someone is uh now having said that i think you know if something is fairly
blatantly bad right and you could just quite strongly establish that say with last jedi right
there could be you know a question raised about someone's intelligence who wants to deny
the logic and the argument is a you're you're wrong because yeah you could have some form
of a through line there but ugly that's just yeah ugly how do you determine someone's ugly
from the reference of boba fat and even if you couldn't like i because perhaps there are you
know the comments people saying you know a few people saying that right and that's not what i'm
blowing my head off about is the fact that he is establishing it seems like everyone who dislikes
that it thinks that people who disagree with him are dumb and ugly that seems to be the uh the
straw man is establishing here it's like come off it wouldn't you guys just be like like i would
i would happily dismiss it like stop being so childish this is not like actual criticism this
is lame if i don't even know if it qualifies as criticism does criticism have to be relevant
or can it just be anything i have no idea i'd have to check but like you know if fringy says
one plus one is three and then i go well you're ugly like just because even if fringy's wrong
that doesn't mean my criticism was actually criticism you're ugly and did you say something
you're ugly and your math is shit yeah and the issue i'm taking with this myself is that
it's he's implying that that's what people who don't like tlga do framing yeah framing
i was just like come on boba fat boba fat isn't a very good character if you want to analyze
character that sounds like an objective claim yeah first off your opinion doesn't matter but
if it did your y'all would agree with you he should have just stopped watching our empire
because is he referencing like how can he have this position i'm assuming he's one of the
subjectivity people i mean i'm interested by the fact that look at that he's got external conflict
caused by outer problem solution blocked by internal conflict the theme is like i'm just like
oh do you actually believe in this do you think that all films should apply to this because
that's interesting we could talk about it we've got to apply this standard to a movie he likes
perhaps the last jedi even and see if it holds up to this screen our opinions don't matter
character conflict caused by inner problem solution by misguided goal solution
by external you think he just googled this and threw it up probably maybe
you didn't come up with it now plot plus character equals theme
let me see plot plus character put into a calculator i'm putting it into a calculator
it helps me with my letters ah yes
yep it's the first fucking thing that pops up where is this theme where is this you know
you think determining theme what does that have to do with defining how good a character is
yeah i know like a character can be without theme like that's entirely possible technically
without plot you could have a character just sitting in on toilet i mean unless you define
a plot as literally just whatever the character's goal is right so character taking a shit you can
have a theme not related to the problem at all it could be you know just the idea that's being
talked about the theme of love or relationships or something like infinity war there's a theme
of like putting your loved ones above the safety of the universe if you will while
all of that is this like the plot is prevent Thanos from getting the gems
like wow everybody's uh this is the film is saying something about familial love
i never thought i'd be watching some prick bring up a chart to show me why he doesn't like
bubba fit he's just fucking cool if someone said he's not a the uh he's not a good character
quote unquote i'd be like do you mean he's not like he's not a contradictive character in any
way he's just really thin yeah like there's not really anything there he's not he's not
bad in the sense that he's contradictory yeah like you said there's just not much to really
not really much there he's just evil bounty hunter man yeah yeah there is a purpose that
he needs to fill for the narrative and it doesn't need to be a complex character it's to be uh the
bounty hunter that captures you know um harm solo and so to achieve that standard effectively
it works that he's intimidating that is a bit mysterious that he you know he can do his job
all right he seems to fulfill his purpose quite well um uh of what the character is meant to do
and so from he's not superfluous either he's not like you know redundant he this is what i mean
you can't say that he's bad at worst you could say he's thin and people would be like yeah probably
but he's cool and you could develop sorry the thing if he said by bad i mean thin i'd be like
right well then you need to just say thin if by bad you mean thin just say thin
just say the word that you mean no that's body shaming but see by his own standard that you know
you know the guy that you see pressed the lever on the death star he was a bad character
yeah i mean what do we know about his life does he have any hobbies does he play tennis
we're gonna have another situation you generate this whole thing for this guy
you know he was just having a good day at work he called his daughter he's like yeah i'll be
home late you know i'm late at work but you know go to bed early tell your mother i love her you
know he's blissfully unaware of what the station even does he's just like work for the empire you
know try to put food on the table i tell you to push a button and pull a lever and it makes a
funny you sound and that's what i do you know my wife got injured on the job
you know darth vader comes by he's like good work good job you're doing a good job you know
keep an eye on that lever i don't know hey honey darth vader complimented me
honey make a cake for vader
can you imagine like oh god oh god oh god i got it and he's like oh hmm that was very good i'll
pass my compliments on to the emperor for you it's like i'm moving up honey you know i might
be working with the emperor i i just gotta go into work tomorrow and you know all i gotta
do is flick a lever it's gonna be great i'll see you tomorrow that he blows up and it's just like
when you walk for darth those upper positions are always you know becoming available so you're
always moving up in the back there's a lot of room for growth a lot of potential for moving up
you have the celebration the medal scene in in a new hope it all works out and then there's this
epilogue scene where these series of stormtroopers arrive in a car and they come out with this
little thing to this little house there's the the wife a folded and a folded empire flag yeah
she's got a little cooking outfit on she's like i've just got the the spaghetti bolognese is ready
for me there is he coming over i'm so sorry
god imagine how many people they'd have to visit for that they never they have to go around like
a million houses he wasn't a good character too so fuck him sir you like the armor and you like
something that was said about the okay wait i can tell you why i like him like beyond the armor i
don't think because he's almost implying that he is like kind of superfluously it's it's more the
look but it's like he's pretty important he makes um things happen because of him he makes the whole
of like the beginning of return of the jedi happen he's like the reason there's so much
conflict in um because you know even darth maul you can defend to a degree he pulls the jedi away
from being able to help do anything else and he kills qui-gon which you could say qui-gon could
have done a lot had he not been killed like you know darth maul's doing some stuff and then you
the final comparison is phasma where it's like oh right she was literally like pointless change
anything in fact her existence makes it so they're able to take the shields down
it's she's like she's just the worst out of all of them and a lot of people like to say like oh
phasma darth maul boba fed they're all the same that argument drives me crazy i've had a video
about this in the back of my mind for like the last year that i've wanted to do to argue this
point that they just like to compare them and it's like it's one extreme or the other like
bubba fit does things have you heard how he talks to darth fighter like he's got some balls on him
yeah but you know this is absolutely the cool factor it's just like if you're not getting that
from from him that's fine it's just that uh fucking cool i hated how he died it's a flat
what if it died like a little bee well he didn't he wasn't supposed to die in pan in there that's
the thing so i don't know if that's a part that disney retconned or not oh disney'll bring him
back if they can like i'm assuming in the expanded universe he's he's alive he set off
like we all know that that's the case because people want him to have a better death than that
or at least to go on it's just funny because uh isn't it like george didn't like boba is that
the case i remember reading that somewhere oh what's not to like i don't know it might be but
like it would be kind of annoying if you threw like a random character in and you worked really
hard on the other ones and everyone's like my favorite is that one you'd be like
i don't fucking give him a humiliated death we like him that it's like oh
that character you like the armor and you like something that was said about the character other
than that the character doesn't do anything but you don't know why he does he does a lot
yeah he does is he telling us why we like the character this is this is what i really
he's reading our mind and telling us we like the character because of these reasons
doesn't he trek hound solo he does a lot he's the reason i can't get captured
he's the he's also just he's like uh you know he's like a tough confident bad character he's
just like i'm gonna do what i want kind of thing you know like they're like we don't get a lot of
screen time to develop him much but he fulfills the purpose the character was meant to fulfill
quite effectively and there's a lot of famous characters like that jaws out of james bond
is just it's not the deepest character but you know we we love that sort of character
yeah it's meant to be a bit weird intimidating freaky tough hard to beat you know like
sometimes you've got a happy ending too yeah you don't every character doesn't need to be
fleshed out they need to be just enough to fulfill the role they're meant to do in the
narrative to move it forward and of course you want the main characters to be fleshed out and
you know engaging in some measure but even having said that sometimes having a two-dimensional
character can be fun if it's just meant to be the type that they are like have you seen um
arnold schwarzinger's commando character is pretty thin yeah yeah stick around
all right no that was that was predator it was um what was it oh remember when i told you i'd
kill you last yeah that's right you did i lied my friend he's dead tired let off some steve bennett
oh shit
i think you're careful of a badly written character that's just brilliant
he could be brilliantly written because is achieving the purpose what you want for that
type of film you know but anything that's one of the problems with the new films is the characters
like bubba fete created this universe where other stories were going on and this cool character
comes in that everyone's scared of so when you watch that your mind goes oh there's this big
world out there i wonder what else he did you know it's it's really a great thing about the
original ones and even the prequels and it's a really bad thing with the sequels the sequel
it feels like this isn't a galaxy it doesn't feel like there's anything else going on
everything is about these characters even when you first see bubba fete like there's there's all
those bounty hunters it's like this world they live in this is what goes on these are the guys
they can call on and there's they're all over the universe it just gives it that sense of scale but
now i think i yeah damn i think it's it's all about when you're creating a world you have to
establish that there are other things happening not everything is about the main thing like
you know this for boba fete this is just another job it's just he's got another job he's got
another thing that he's doing it's um it just it creates the idea of something bigger than
uh than what we see and that's that's the cantina does that and yeah yeah does that like there's
all these people coming and going that are having their own adventures and i don't feel that at all
with yes i don't know what makes the world feel alive and we're just looking at one part of it
while in the new ones it's like there's nothing everything else is dead yeah nothing else is
happening except for gambling on camel horse things gambling sanctioned by the republic
that it enforces labor we want these guys back everyone remember guys should have been horrified
when rose showed that ring to the kids they should have screamed and see and been horrified
that they'd come oh no our oppressors please don't that see that to me i would have been like
yeah this is interesting like how are they going to deal with it the people of the world
hate the republic that would be interesting we can't imagine the empire ran a better system
than the republic did in power and that the world was starting to become testy that they want they
want it back yeah i think it'd be an awesome that's why that's why when lyre sends out the
signal for help no one comes because i hope you die you know it's like why are that cool
fuck you they're the resistance but they're like the actual army it would be like if the u.s army
was called the resistance it's retarded they're the army that's it oh fucking hell you're allowed
to like that character thank you i like lobot there's no reason to like lobot he doesn't do
anything it's probably a reason you like something yeah think about it a little bit just think a
little bit boy he might be sexually attracted to him yeah maybe maybe you know it could be a number
reasons like that that thing around his head it's like a handle shapes his head hmm he says
you get good grip on that thing he doesn't say anything does he does he does he ever say anything
i don't think so he's kind of mysterious oh makes you more attractive yeah
uh i just i feel like he maybe he doesn't actually like lobot he just chose it because
it's like such a hard character to actually pick things up he hasn't thought about lobot in fucking
ages i don't see a lobot figure back there don't you lie to me maybe you could read the comics
and be like well characters really end up that has a lot of great things yeah great but in the
movie in the context of the movie i liked the character separate from that i read all the
com books i read the books it's like i'm i'm there with you we're fanboys together but i'm also a
fangirl i love being a fangirl whoa is that a sponsor that's the out of effect of his balls
just leaving his body and leaving i don't know how to react to this i need help
look at look at chat huh what what the fuck what
i'm i'm i am a fangirl we know we know you're a you're a proud diva queen you know
yes girl slay okay and you know he's sort of over the place is saying you know where guys
you like you know where geeks that like this stuff and i'm there with you it's like no you're
not the whole point of this video is to separate him from the toxic males who hate star wars just
a happy fangirl i'm not one of those men i'm a good guy
i like that you said is this a sponsor
i mean is it is it's fun i don't know because oh no it's not okay it's just
discussion i love it and and what is discussion without judgment
that was a good point discussion without judgment like you already are judging it you're judging
a positive if you have a position then you've already made judgments yeah and you've judged
the opposing side to either be wrong or inferior to your own that's a bigidious line there fringy
what is discussion without judgment what is yeah that's uh you can put that on a t-shirt fringy
with uh you know 2019 because it sounds like a pretty glad to be well it's a bit of a sing song
you're all saying the same thing at once yeah if no judgment is made then no then you have no take
you have no perspective because a positive judgment is a judgment like a positive opinion
is a judgment it's just positive to relate to the the lobot thing right the reason i would ask why
do you like robot lobot is because i already am aware that he's barely on screen and he has
barely any characteristics i'm curious because i've judged him to be a pretty thin character
but you really like attack i'd like to know what i'm missing
and then it turns out i'm not missing anything he's just insane it's like oh okay
interesting video and yeah we're gonna lose star wars
i'd rather lose it than have it turn to shit yeah you know kill it oh yeah you have to
we'd have to sing her opinions don't matter i can't remember whose whose point it was but
someone did say something along the lines of like better we have disney stowels the no stowels and
i was like um no i would rather them stop okay enough even if it's shit at least we have it
motherfucking disney stowels on this motherfucking plane
of exist plane of reality yeah i don't want to lose star wars getting tired of it but not because
of the films i enjoy solo so much it's a ton of fun rogue one ton of fun last jedi they're
all just great it's all just great they're all just tons of fun they're all just tons of fun
i'd like i'd like to get displaced if saying ton of fun with all the people getting better
than rogue one and then that's an interesting way to describe it just play the clip where
Han Solo's getting tortured yeah it's a ton of fun you know all he says is ton of fun like
they're just that's just they're just fun they're just fun they're great they're fun
it's just kind of fun is it the scorched skeletons of luke's son's and uncle it's a ton of fun
the the the movie is like i hate you ton of fun yeah oh yeah ton of fun is just getting cooked
you know just screaming it seems like is of the opinion that anything star wars
is good no no no no no what we we just don't want star wars we want good star wars yeah i'd rather
have no star wars than bad star wars that's that's it and to test that theory theory further it's just
like have tommy was our director star wars film and see what he says that this is a bad idea
oh it's just no guys it's just a space wizard movie god and for kids get over yourself children
i'm always amazed with these guys that have these channels on talking about movies but they seem so
disinterested in having interesting movies like they just yeah like they don't want to discuss it
they don't want to judge it they it's just fun that's it let's move on it's fun i just just
consume making videos yeah i know right it's it's like it's like they don't care at all which makes
it all the more strange that they talk about it yeah do they care you know like to hopefully unreal
start star wars is fun it's about space wizards
i wish i could take space
take space with us away from their vocabulary it's like explain what you really mean when you're
saying that well maybe because i always assume that they try to say it's stupid and retarded
so who cares it's like that's no lord of the rings is stupid and retarded you got light-feeding
dwarf the light-feeding elf people and dwarves but they're just wizards there's a difference
between land and space wizards as if the natural state of wizard doesn't have a plane this is
you know i gotta say i never heard anybody call star wars silly space wizards for kids
until the disney star wars films i never heard anybody say that oh yeah i never heard i never
said that i never said that about the movies because that's stupid and dumb i mean when um
i think i've said before but when i saw revenge of the sith in the cinema and um i'd have to when
it was revenge of the sith 2004 uh 2005 2005 in 12 uh when i saw kantuku's hands get chopped off
i was like whoa like and then where he's just like cut off his head it's just like do it yeah
you know that movie's quite dark yeah there's a lot of things that happen where i was kind of like
man i'm i'm good to see this right when he looks down at his hands but then cut off it's
fantastic and then you just see this guy dresses a cloud right around to the cinema going it's just
for space was i don't i don't understand like why anybody was saying there's so much death
in uh in star wars and not just like kitty death the people getting their heads cut off people
getting burnt to death people getting blown up in space and seeing them scream as they get blown up
it's not really for like okay it's kids enjoy it is it really for kids necessarily fundamentally
or is it for everyone this is the complicated question because you'd be like is it marketed
for a particular demographic or multiple ones and what's the what are they mainly going for
and i i'd happily say maybe teenagers younger teenagers yeah i'd say so and it could they try
to cast a broad net they they want to get a broad kind of audience to get you know the most views
yeah this is what i'm getting out of like me being 12 i'd be like am i a kid then like well yeah but
when i when they say for kids i always assume they're talking about like six-year-olds or something
or just doesn't make any sense who cares and i think another element to this stupid statement
is that because there is you know fantasy elements in a movie or even fictional elements you it's
like then they're trying to say you don't have a right to take it seriously because of this one
thing that is unrealistic which is just uh it's quite a dumb because of course you can take it
seriously and in actual fact the concept of a space wizard if executed in an interesting
fun way can absolutely be taken seriously well is cool right and then if you are consistent with
how the force works you can have it work in a very satisfying way almost like a physical war
if you're if you remain true to it they're not they aren't always true to how the force works
but it it's just such a cop-out weak nothing argument to say oh it has this fantasy element
ergo everything is not you can't take it seriously at all because that's unrealistic fiction by
definition is unrealistic because it's fiction let alone fantasy they love star wars but they
want to make fun of the thing that makes star wars magic and the magic is it touches everyone and
even if it was made for kids it doesn't matter adults lined up to see it people took days off
work to go you know to see when empire strikes back kind of that's the magic and then they love
this thing popping up all over the place because some children's content's amazing as i mentioned
that yeah there's this content in these films that just don't necessarily seem to be for children
they'll be happy if someone says i adore it and then if someone says i hate it they'll be like
uh dude it's for kids yeah wait so why is he allowed to love it yeah the other thing the
like the addition of a fantastical element in and of itself is not an inherent thing that makes
something more kid-like or unreal or unrealistic yes but like i'm serious is what i'm saying
in actual fact adding an interesting fantastical element can elevate a story to be able to achieve
things that a purely realistic story would not be able to do the whole idea of the force with the
dark side and the light side elevates the theme dare i say of the battle between good and evil
to a new place which you wouldn't have been able to achieve if you kept it just in a completely
realistic thing and so it doesn't mean that because it has a fantastical element is more
ridiculous and you can't take it seriously it's just such a stupid thing to say and these are
often people who will point out the deep themes as well yeah exactly like they're contradicted by
their own argument and like oh lord of the rings is a movie about lad wizards written for children
and the hate and the aunties it's just like
you're ruining it the hidden criticism didn't help write your scripts write your scripts come up
with jokes don't just say noises noises are funny um and yeah didn't wrote it first well before we did
and the idea that people shouldn't take movies seriously is also done because movies can have
strong influence on how people frame themselves how they grow up and everything like that like
superhero comic books had a big influence on me i'm helping me be a better person and so people
create deep connections with these fictional characters that do mean a lot to them
and trying to take it seriously because it's fiction is what is what is the role of fiction
if not to make us learn things about ourselves potentially and learn things about the world and
like affect us emotionally it's um and i don't like this uh this this sort of interpretation of
if it's not realistic like if it's not if it's if it's speculative fiction it's childish slash
immature slash dumb that's so bizarre to me that's so stupid and it really devalues the work
of people who work in those genres i mean like what is what is the lord of the rings if not you
know it's speculative it's fantasy it's it's got fantastical elements is it childish like
fuck no it's one of the best stories ever told well what the fuck why are you devaluing it because
and kids suck because because by devaluing it yeah by devaluing it he then thinks it's devaluing
and illegitimizing our logical arguments that we're applying to it saying you shouldn't even
be taking it seriously because it's an unrealistic movie so you're well you know i feel like Tolkien
took it seriously when he wrote it so yeah fuck yourself and would you not agree shad that in
doing so he is hoisting himself by his own petard Oz is highlighting reasons for why he shouldn't
be even making these arguments exactly i mean why is he arguing about this if it's just a movie
about space wizards why is he taking it so seriously why do you care why you care friend
why don't you care about things that aren't for children like Zelda yeah i mean
yeah well it's funny right because this is going to come up in the next video that we discuss
if we get it yeah if we get there at this rate keep going i gotta use uh the loose i'll be right
back oh i'm gonna quickly go to carry on fringy oh uh where was i going with that i brought
zelda all right all i said was it's gonna be relevant so uh it's it's funny though because
he's got a statue of link in the background link doesn't have a character necessarily
he's a blank slate by design so when he's shitting on boba fat that's really interesting
when he has a link thing in the background i like link too but he's basically a vessel for the
the player he doesn't really have uh other than i guess noble and heroic but yeah by the way uh
fringy you watch you watch community the reason i actually said hoisted by your own petard is
because of the uh the episode where jeff calls britter on it he uses oh yeah and then he says
do you know what that means and she says it's when they're trying like old timey folk and put
it on their clothes and they get like the hoist of it stuck or something like that and i was and
he was like you need to look up what that means and i remember being myself being like i don't
even know what it means i just use it and i looked into it i was like oh that's interesting
and now i want to make shad make a video on it you can talk about minions and stuff while doing it
and you can make it all medieval style because you'll be like most people don't even know what
a petard is you know back back in medieval days i imagine that they didn't have these arguments
about opinions you know i think they had better things to do like surviving yeah it's interesting
i just recently made a video on the medieval judicial dueling and yeah so many comments were
like saying bring it back this would resolve cancel culture completely many many of you
someone is like if you really mean to accuse me i'll prove my innocence by fighting you to the
death you want to keep accusing me medieval dueling is uh really i learned about it for a like um
law history related to my degree um that was a few years ago but yeah no i found it really
interesting the idea of like you know trial by combat you can you know do what was the other
one that's trial by combat trial by um it was like putting your body under extreme stress and
seeing if you survived was another option um maybe you talked about that in your video
uh no no just the the combat side of things yeah the combat one's really cool though isn't it
it's just uh well i mean it's it's it's trickles down into the way that our legal system works
today because it is a combative you know it's combative you have your prosecution your your
plaintiff your defense so you talked about how people using it as a way to steal people's
fucking stuff it's like i can i can take your shit from you if i could get this right
yeah that's in the home gang tradition because it uh it's okay it varies of course between culture
but in some instances you could you would get all the property and things there person uh who you
beat like if you defeated someone you'll get everything that they owned i mean that's that's
feudalism right there you know we've gone from that to this guy on screen who feels attacked
if you ask him his opinion on a character in a movie what has happened it's uh
man history is so cool isn't it history is just the coolest thing i love history
imagine him thinking he's going to lose his funko pops if someone beats him up
uh i'm sure you would put it in the specifications although the the the pre-fight you'd be like you
cannot take my funko pop all right i was only gonna burn them anyway fair enough ruin saga you are
we've got a bunch of anakin skywalkers out there who are giving into the fear
they're giving into the oh my god don't let this don't let the dark side win guys does this remind
you of any one rags star wars is about finding the hope nobody's doing that anymore
wow that impression is remarkable
wait shad you know who i'm talking about do you i know exactly who you're talking about prove it
i hate everything shit nice i didn't think oh yeah that was a really embarrassing you doubt me mauler
sometimes i i really hate that if people too emotion they're like oh this is what star wars
is about loving things it's like fucking you don't like the prequel shut up if you don't
like star wars then the emperor wins it's just bullshit coming right hit everything anyway because
he hated the prequels he's like prequels are full of shit he's like are you supposed to be
fighting the hope it's like unironically if someone says that's you how do you take that
seriously it's like it's it's a franchise about finding the hope you'd be like okay
okay but you know it's still it can still be bad
this well what happens if there's a film about just being a good film than what
it's the desperation like how is this for a look back rags like the amount of arguments we have
seen in favor of tlj and just disney stiles in general it's just like there's no way they won't
go oh like he's reverting to basic ename gibberish now don't they giving him to their fear
what it's uh it's really pointing out like a movie shit i do like the idea that they're like
the movies that you love say you shouldn't do this it's like dude stop it this is not a good
argument please stop anger and they're going hateful if you love star did you see that
moment there where he was just like i cannot believe they're doing this unbelievable this
is so nice star wars i have funko pops like he looks genuinely like perturbed he's like
this is wrong much follow the rules that you learn in star wars about how to be a better person
are you paying no attention let me replay that don't tell me to like shitty things
oh fuck i'm just gonna play that again if you love star wars so much follow the rules that you
learn in star wars about how to be a better person don't like star wars you're a bad person
yeah i want to follow this rabbit hole all the way through like what does star wars
actually teach okay if it does establish any like themes or statements about how a person
should behave what are they and then i want to apply it to him and see if you know this is just
a contradictory mess i'm hearing going to kill my father yeah no no no no you're supposed to
go into your nephew's bedroom while he's asleep get out your kitchen and then as soon as he
realizes go i'm sorry i had a bad dream sorry motor weakness but then if you are the nephew
in that scenario you need to learn that you need to kill every child in the house at that point
if that ever happened the deed must be completed you need the old grabber to wear a black cape
saying do it i wonder if he's referencing you know the emperor's words were given to your hatred
and your journey to the dark side will be complete will be complete i can't believe
what's interesting about this that's actually contradicted because luke technically does
give into his hatred and he grabs his lightsaber and goes to kill him darth vader stops him luke
uses his passion to defeat darth vader and he doesn't turn to the dark side as a result
it's just an interesting thing there and so it would almost seem like that the uh the emperor
the evil emperor was lying about that maybe just maybe no it's almost like they were good movies
what happened to good movies dead they died because there's no such thing as bad movies now
they're all great stop judging things you're paying no attention you attack women on the internet
so there are some things we call telling statements and what we mean by that is they
say something and we can draw a lot out of their character from it says a lot about you
it's a good old Freudian slip thanks Freudian for coming up with that Freudian Freud i think
he very much intended to say that i think his name was Freud not Freudian oh okay Freudian
uh that was actually funny that was a good catch rags i would have missed that funny if not
i didn't know that yeah thanks Freudian
actually someone take that just do something with that come up with something
beginning it's just biggest inspiration was Freudian
oh what was Freudian about him he's like no it was it was Freudian
and just going back on what he was saying you know about learning from star wars star wars at
its most basic form is a story between good and evil and specifically about good opposing evil
and that also means good hating evil okay again people thinking that hate is a universal bad no
if you hate evil that's a good thing and you can easily make an argument that that's exactly what
star wars is trying to tell oppose what is wrong um and take a stand on what is right
that seems to be what i'm doing or what we're doing you know like
trying to big yourself up as a good guy shad is that right
people might say this because like i don't know this guy personally and he could be a really
friendly nice guy but i disagree with what he's saying and and he is vilifying a lot of people
here particularly a whole gender and he is making these huge false equivalents you hate star wars
equals you are attacking women online and you hate women like what he said here
where the hell is that connection coming from reminds me of the quinton trump quote he just
like whoa like where did this come from he might think ryan johnson's a woman
that's the only person i've been attacking
luke skywalker complaining about ralo you want luke to be luke but you're not even acting like
a luke you're not being a good person i don't need to act like a character to want them to be
consistent what the fuck fuck and again he's probably he's right there's no yeah i'd like to
look everyone i'll be weak i'll give up on people try and kill
like exactly the slightest hint of weakness means we need to you know probably kill them even though
he tries he stops himself but still i mean that's a lesson we could take from luke like don't give
you know don't try and breathe because like luke tried to always save people he tried to save his
you know Darth Vader his father who was like a genocidal mass murderer the idea is that he would
be willing to put himself in such peril that he would very likely die because he wouldn't give up
on somebody and yet he had a bad dream he wouldn't give up and again he's all basing this on this
vilifying false equivalence that you dislike star wars or now last jedi means you hate women
stop hating women there's like it's good it's uncanny how do people actually feel that way
like it's insane it's now i'm thinking about luke i can't imagine like the betrayal of luke's
character as i just said that out loud it's just like he man ryan johnson just did not give a fuck
like when he wrote that he didn't give a shit no he did not be like luke stay home hate everyone
hate when women turn up your door drink tea milk just be a prick and be just like luke
turn your back on everyone i think the best sentence to just refer to is i came to this
island to die like oh why don't you just kill yourself just jump off the fucking mountain
it act like luke give up when you have a setback you know um just abandoned the world
yeah because that's what luke does he gives up that's his character he gives up on things
we're famous giver upper oh my god i'm having a mental breakdown here like as i think about the
betrayal of his character treating people well like who like did you learn nothing do you literally
watch it and you're like it's about wars oh there are wars any more holy god you do
consider it criticism of fascism and capitalism like and that the wars are representative of those
systems being brought to the negative like a lot of people feel that way including his
let's say team the people who think that we hate women often say that it's trying to be critical
of capitalism uh through war profiteering and so when he's like it's about wars it's like yeah a
lot of them would say that it's trying to be critical of warfare like even i do like the
idea that uh the biggest media franchise in the world that makes billions of dollars is about
you know the badness of proper tearing it's just like okay
uh it's a it's a struggle to understand from me from this guy i just like he's like he's trying
to be like you're all dumb you're not seeing star wars for what it is uh i'm assuming he's
gunning for subtext slash the truth of the characters in the stars is that is that as
much as you can receive i can't wait until he says people just hate star wars because there was
definitely enough room on that door for jack because there's a message there about acceptance
about tolerance this is hilarious the dark side cannot be tolerated it is a paradigm that does not
work the dark side cannot coexist with the light side is about trying to eradicate somebody
someone's faction like it's about tolerance like excuse me no it's never been about that no
whenever he hits one of these very juicy words he gives himself a little pat on the back like
there's a little break him after the word because he's so happy he's hit that word
tolerance i said tolerance which means i am tolerant and tolerances are good this uh you
remember that south park episode where they went to the uh the museum of tolerance and then and
then like they're like you know it's good to be tolerant and then they see somebody smoking a
cigarette outside and they're like get the fuck out of here you filthy smoker yeah that's always
exactly what we're seeing here he just promoted tolerance when he is like so vilifying people
ruining star wars be tolerant guys well it's the hilarious hypocrisy right be tolerant of everything
except intolerance then you're like but if you're intolerant of people who are intolerant that aren't
you intolerant of therefore we should be you're intolerant yeah and he's done the redneck voice
he's done a lisp yeah he's done the retarded voice it's so so this is one of bad people you also know
what ever uses that voice in a good context it's always negative i'm sure it's bad stupid ugly
people who have this voice is hilarious like trump had this voice i find it funny that uh the redneck
voice is just the voice that americans often do for stupid it's like that's a little bit mean
it's an accent there's a message it would be like if uh if you presented
messages like i you know this this is what i think of this movie i think it is a good movie
you know something like that it's just like wow that's racist jesus christ he's talking about
racism can we go back like there's a message about racism is he implying people who dislike
the movie and how racist as well and there's a message i don't even know what there's messages
about the racism that the humans are like the empire is racist towards other aliens
the empire just doesn't like anybody i mean if you really think about it what does the empire do
it's like it's trying to get the layers captured a weak spot technically for their giant super
weapons so they kill a bunch of people in order to try and coax it out of here that's like the first
major evil act we see um but that's not because they're aliens that's pretty nondiscriminate yeah
like they're not trying to wipe out other races because races are inferior they're trying to
conquer races and bring them all under their umbrella rule like look at the bounty hunters
they seem pretty diverse you had like a reptile man and a robot didn't mind them coming on board
i mean the empire grew out of the republic which was a unifying a unified nation of all these
different races in one and essentially if that is what turned into the empire the empire is
a unification of all these races under you know a dictator but there is there is never been an
implication there has never been an implication of uh human supremacy in star wars i don't know
where two things from chat defrosted robot said that it's in the it's definitely covered in the
expanded universe that they have race and toward aliens um but this guy's already specified that
we're talking about the movies so let's talk about the movies only uh jay said the fact that
the empire is entirely human could be an implication of the human supremacist angle of the empire perhaps
maybe i don't know i didn't yeah you'd think that there'd be a lot more race especially
considering how diverse the rebels are but is snoke human i think we'll never know i think so
yeah we don't know yeah well are there any aliens in the employ of the empire uh not that you see
in the original release i remember of rocky relationships with people like java right like
they're on the counter rims they just leave them alone then again that doesn't really mean they
don't hate him but it is worthwhile to remember that these movies are made by human beings so
you're gonna have more human characters just by default because that's just your actors that's
what you've got how rags just said you know like in the rebel team you do you get a selection of
aliens you got chubaka on the uh yes but it is mostly human beings because it's a movie it's
practical yeah to have more people it's just that i don't think there are leaders amongst the rebels
oh yeah yeah yeah exactly i uh not so but it's more just like i'm thinking about the fact that
it is a film that you know it's the same as like in star trek how all the aliens are just like
humans with weird prosthetic makeup you know like the only implication yeah i was about to say
thrawn thrawn yeah but if we're only considering the movies then we can't count thrawn yeah yeah
but thrawn is a part of the the new expand universe well does he yeah he's not a he's not
a human yeah he's grievous human uh no he wasn't he was not a human technically grievous wasn't in
the empire i don't know if this matters well he's part of the yeah he was a cis one but uh
and then mall was only sith not necessarily empire but i doubt that if anakin didn't follow
through and you still had mall that that the emperor would have ditched mall when he became
part of the empire this is interesting to think about if they'd had a scene like at the start of
force awakens where they went into a village and kill all the aliens take the humans captured
maybe yeah that might have been there's never anything like that they just blow up whole
the important point is that um i wouldn't say there's an overt message of the empire hating
aliens no to sort of reflect racism bad i don't think well i i think uh i think um unlike because
the nazis one of the main goals was to purge certain races and that was obvious whereas
the empire's principal goal is to establish complete control over the galaxy technically
there's only grounds to say that the empire might be not racist but is it speciest because maybe
because uh i there were black people in higher up positions in the empire times you mean
race traitors well i think i think the idea would be that in in a in a world where you have
aliens like races in between you know like if a species it's less relevant because you have a lot
more in common than you do with an alien you know it's true but uh if he's trying to say there's
a message about racism that's overt in star wars i i don't know i don't know what to say it's not
overt i can't see it yeah it's i when i know when i was a kid especially i didn't even think about
it it was never even a thing that came to my mind a bear when i wish with me you have to wish with
the emperor there were many aliens in the galactic senate and the senate was only dissolved as of a
new hope so yes that's right i was about to say i wish when the emperor got pair he just stood up
there and went i can't wait to kill half you fuckers yeah i don't think it exists i mean if
anything humans are portrayed as being a little inferior to other races who are either stronger
more capable more force you know uh yeah it's pretty strong yep maybe humans like just linked
with the force better i'm not sure about i don't know that might be eximix yeah i don't know of
course is racist then maybe humans are only the weak ones that go to the bed so all the other
aliens are too strong and too pure darth maul except for darth maul yeah yeah well grievous
isn't connected to the empire's race he doesn't have any force abilities i'd have to know but
look into the grievous man grievous is one of my favorite characters if if i got the opportunity
to make a general grievous movie i would jump at the opportunity i think you can do a really cool
story with him this is towards other aliens the regionalist against center worlds or core world
do you think there's a racial that's political and pragmatic this isn't really explored in the
movies that extensively like if you ask the average viewer what's the difference between
the deep core and the core worlds it'd be like i have no fucking clue what you're talking about
well most people wouldn't know because it's it's not like a major like that's really the thing for
their big star wars fans you know like yeah yeah the only time it's really even into that
for the most part is in episode one where we learn oh tattoos far away they don't accept
for yeah chorus i know that yeah that must be far away credits are no good here
man remember when world building was a thing i love mason world building
they're racist against droids luke is um that's interesting droids aren't even a race
first off they're arguably not even sentient well the implication is that droids don't have
free will they will do what they're told even though they have personalities and stuff they
always obey their orders depends on the original trilogy it's just robots well some of them are
just robots and then some of them have implied sentience like a lot of people would like to
think that r2d2 is uh sentient to a degree the fact that he seems to be playful to a degree
well i think i think the the droids the uh the confederate droids which i love i think they're
great uh that they have personalities and they make jokes and they are afraid of death but they
still obey orders and they're not valued so why what are they e2so and if we're considering
disney as well well i mean i don't even know if he's just referencing the ot here i don't know
i like how we're getting so much more discussion out of just the things that he blasts by
just like let's talk about this for 10 years it's kind of racist against droids the way he treats
them leah hon all of them they all no vexes the robots it's like saying you're racist against
your toaster or your oven i was gonna say this is complicated this is a weird because you remember
they like we don't is it they don't do they say we don't serve your kind here uh in the even a
droid tells another droid that we don't serve droids here droids don't give a fuck because
they're just robots they're not like ai i just think at least the vast vast majority of the ones
that we're talking about i'm just not sure if that is definitively established if they're
fully sentient and self-aware no i i don't know if we know i was gonna say solo kind of just lets
the cat out of the bag with that one it's like look if you take the things off them they all want to
be free it's like uh no this fucks yeah like this fucks with everything well i because i just
wonder it's like how the fuck did that even happen it's literally like a droid with a single purpose
did you program it to have sentience why why would you do that why would you put sentience into your
toaster i have no mouth and i must toast i have no bread and i must toast it reminds me about you
know rick and morty what is my purpose you pass clutter oh my god they would just pull up by the
way the clone wars would probably give people reason to not like droids yeah really a whole army
of evil droids you want to destroy that's what i was getting at like if he's gonna say that there
is a message against you know racism because droids are mistreated in star wars in actual star wars
no one's like there's no nothing mentioned in the original trilogy to imply that mistreating droids
was bad it's like that they either deserved it or they're just you know you know i definitely deserve
it the only time when anyone brings up this might be bad is in the solo movie with that weird droid
that's like droid liberation yeah and then it's not every other movie like star wars isn't saying
that mistreating droids is bad they mistreat the droids and say yeah it's perfectly fine that seems
to be the message it would almost be like if an alien watched a movie where a man and his dog are
doing hunting and stuff and then the alien is like this movie's trying to tell us that it's uh it's
bad to be speciesists to the dog because the dog doesn't want to be there the dog's being mistreated
it's put on a leash and you'd be like i don't think you're grasping that's not yeah i think
you're drawing something out of there that's not there like i don't think there was enough material
in the ot about the position of droids in society and whether or not they like what the
systems are how they're like what even which droids because you can't establish that every
droid is sentient is a fork with a little battery attached i don't know what's what's the lowest
degree of robot does it do they all have sentience well yeah what about what what about clones
were the clones uh the clones have the chip in their head that makes them respond directly
to the commands of the emperor when order 66 happens so they don't technically have free will
they have free will up until it comes to that that's kind of really established they're all
put into none of them so well it depends on uh because remember the clone wars
in the clone wars there are certain things that happen that imply sentience oh yeah i agree with
you on that but again i think we're restricted to the films with this discussion i think uh yeah i
if we are then yeah that's just not enough about the clones to tell us they do what they're told
yeah there's no there's nothing that's mentioned about like clone rebellions where they want to
not be soldiers well no it's only in the expanded universe where that kind of stuff happens
or the the show because in the show there are clones who are like no fuck the status quo
we're slaves this is not right but even if they are sentient star wars isn't making a statement
that it you should not mistreat them it's actually saying that yeah you can mistreat droids because
they're not human it's not just the thing it's like tell me why it's bad and then they go well
because c3po is clearly sentient and i'd be like is he how do you know that that's not his programming
exactly is there a part in the well he could be programmed to make himself look like that yeah i
was gonna say we have really competent ai today that can come across as manish
like and han when he gets annoyed with cp3po he just turns him off and shut him up
you know we never quite get enough information and i said solo kind of just goes nuts
so large that's like it's just all of a sudden pops up that all droids are sentient and they
want to be free is like whoa whoa don't they treat yeah don't they treat that droider that
she's malfunctioning she's not behaving in the way that that like it should and that they're like
you know only um lando is the only one that's letting her behave that way and anyone else is
like you should probably just wipe her memory and reprogram her and so i think that even in
solo implies that it's not real sentience it's just malfunctioning and the by no but it's when
she takes off the um the bolts off the other robots and they go into a dance party mode and
they are in the also they establish them as like they make it so that they're essentially
leashed like enslaved well they do what they do when you say that's the main thing right that's
what it does yeah i mean they don't really go into it that much though because you know these are
actually really serious questions to ask about artificial intelligence and this they just don't
have the time i don't think at least in the main movie wasn't trying to answer the question exactly
exactly maybe star wars wasn't you know the whole purpose behind it wasn't to make a statement about
ai and self-determinacy which is fine maybe i wanted to be a movie about good versus evil with
these you know themes and stuff dare i say um with cool action adventure and all you know all these
cool things and any implications of racism might just be completely non-issue no everything is
political oh every yes well i mean this is these are the video essays we often criticize but
they'll be like if you can't draw something like that out of a film then you're not very good at
film criticism as in it can't just be the surface level what if it's not in the film actually there
yeah that's what i'm saying is that they'll be like it can't just be what was there it has to
be something you've derived out of it in terms of a pure meaning upon what life is stupid stupid
stupid dumb i'm on board for people giving their ideas of how they interpreted something i just
don't like the idea that if you you don't do that you've missed the point it's like you just
invented the point exactly and especially when they try and say this is definitively what that
scene or this movie means this is what it's saying it's like no it's not i mean you can interpret it
we just had it right now he's like you've missed the part where it's about racism but we've just
discussed for ages like is it is it really i don't think so well the thing is do you think he's even
fucking thought about this no no he doesn't think he's got a fucking lando calrissian funko pop
you think he thinks i'm trying to work at him he's getting from this point back to his men ruining
star wars i thought with that heading we were gonna i don't know talk about the influence very
well structured this video droids wow he probably should have written a script lando is one of the
first people i've ever seen not talk down to a droid everyone talks down to droids in the star
wars universe well maybe he fucking should um does uh does leia talk down to c3po and r2d2 or is it
just c3po i don't think luke does luke values luke doesn't he he loves r2d2 and he's always happy to
see r2 any k is when r2d2 is in trouble well when he's talking about pets r2 right like we are so our
pets yeah our our what is higher in i guess in the humanity tier is it pets or droids
and it goes back to what we're saying before he's openly admitting that droids are mistreated in
star wars so that would imply if star wars was intending to make a statement about how droids
should be treated is that they should be treated bad not that they should be treated good so that
yeah well it's like what is fuck this is stupid let's move on he's not thought about this yeah
we've we've been delving so deep into something he brought up but he doesn't actually give a shit
about it all always been an allegory and a metaphor for racism no no not an allegory
everything's a metaphor everything's an allegory nothing is actually what it is it's something
else that's different than what like a new picture that they were generating this universe there's
going to be high tech in it meaning there's probably going to be robots because everybody
likes robots artificial intelligence tools that are designed to be able to be discussed with and
apply they can do jobs without you having to control them and then you have this c3po and r2d2
characters and this guy on set is like ah so this is about racism can you imagine them being like
sorry he's like oh these are c3po you're trying to say that you shouldn't be racist to people
imagine saying to somebody like who are you like why have you seen that film that
tackles racism and people be thinking of mississippi burning or american history x
no no star wars the new hope is the hope of the robots to one day be free
because remember darth vader is black or it wears black oh well they do make that up until he's
good got whitewashed yeah i've heard that one to burn the black right off
that must have been hot like i said there's no place they won't go
star wars is about racism the thing people the problem people had about episode one is it was
people felt it was racist when it's supposed to be about not being
when has people been saying that is he referring to the fact that there's a lot of stereotypical
voices for aliens people had a problem with george doing that but uh but how is it how would it be
racist to have them be character is he talking about how like the stereotypical jewish accent
comes from a character with a big nose is that is that what he's gunning for
are those the big problems with the movie i like that he set this up by saying that
star wars is all about trying to see racism bad and that episode one does the racism
it was so confusing how he said it because he was just saying how important the issue of racism was
in a new hope but then in episode one it wasn't meant to be about race and it turned into it and
that's bad it was just such a confusing line he said then yeah and at a stretch if he at a stretch
if they try and say it's racist because of certain racial stereotypes and things like that
it would be no more so than nearly every other movie made of that time either and so why is it
standing out it shouldn't it's like no yeah yeah even even then this isn't exactly the issue
people took with it not all the problems that episode one had i think that the
potential racism of the movie kind of down in the list felt that the viceroy were a racist
they felt that jar jar binks was a racist character because it played into stereotypes
now we're in a time where people are saying they wish jar jar binks is back
yeah the new ones must be really shit huh hang on all right he played in the stereotypes and
and he's he's a make-believe character like even that's you're the one that's being racist you know
what's interesting about to claim jar jar binks is a stereotype of black people is coming from
a racist position because that's what i'm saying they think black people act that way yeah what
this character who is clearly not black they're associated falls over is that he's the one playing
races did people say that a lot of people do say that the what how did the fuck did they see that
what is going on they must be racist if they think that's the way black people act to court
to create the connection between jar jar and black people
oh my god i never i can't what the what wasn't he voiced by a black um guy uh yeah i figured that
wasn't relevant i figured it wasn't relevant you know i mean well this is the thing like the
chantenarians what i think they're called uh is like they're asian stereotypes because
they they talk like this and it's just like um you have to highlight exactly how that becomes
racism exactly like a stereotype voice where you can't actually claim that the creator did it
because he wanted to like are you saying george Lucas wants to make fun of an asian stereotype
is that where we're going it's strange and then how do you get around that if if
if all the good people have english acts it's like there's no way around that that means you
can't do any accent so no one's going to be happy i like the the way he brings it around
back to the the folks of the argument is and people want hit jar jar jar racist people want him back
over what we're getting in new star wars like that's so bad you're like right okay
does anyone actually want him back i haven't really got on that one i say
comment on how bad the new ones are because jar jar is a terrible character
and so like i don't think anyone in like non sarcastically wants jar jar back but they do
why not sarcastically want him back you see
oh it was nemodians is that what i was nemodians are the asian yeah what are shantenarians what am
i thinking of when i said i think i'm making that up someone in chat tell me what i'm referring to
because i clearly don't know what i'm referring to uh uh okay i don't know why droid rebellion
it has nothing like come on if you what what are you saying just get there i'm interested
is talking about the droid rebellion in solo now i think which we we have mentioned is an
outlier regarding how droids generally behave in star wars it was very confusing indeed any like
anything more than about freeing slaves um which you should be for just so you know i fucking like
thank you for telling us without him telling us i would not have known that and you're seeing the
parallels you are seeing deeper into a message writers don't always have the intention that we
see in their messages what are you even talking about what is this video even right now like what
what are what is this guy actually better ruining stowels you don't follow it right
we're talking about droid slavery he's saying even if the writers didn't intend it this is what
it is saying yeah now i think the droid rebellion was fairly intentional and were making a statement
about slavery that one was but the original star wars no i'd say not not no the slave labor
in the capitalist planet was probably making some form of a statement there because there
was no slavery before capitalism that's correct it doesn't matter it was under republic control
the whole film is fighting to get the republic back in charge it's just like okay so we want
capitalism i guess well assuming that's what they're referring to because if you remember the
whole point of canto bite is war profiteering but it's like the wars haven't even been happening for
two days isn't it yeah so you can take something from a message that's separate from the what the
writer intended but it's still applicable if you see something that and you think like oh this is
this is feminist propaganda yeah because lord forbid there is equal grounds for men and women
what do you you can't say that when you've made this video
equal ground for men and women mr men suck god forbid we have a right come on there's a lot of
there's a lot of false equivalence false you know statements here and stuff like that
when certain feminist messages that are injected into pop culture these days aren't about
equality between men and women generally it's a bit more about female very female supremacy
my next video is gonna dip into this pretty heavily because it's yeah it's it's pretty blatant
when people say oh you feminism is just about equal rights they're fucking lying to your face
you like how we have this whole uh we want to start renaming words that have men or man in
like mankind needs to be turned into people kind i'm curious if you can apply that with feminism
we should call it everyoneism don't want to be blocking out anybody do we midwife um that should
be midperson yeah well because you get a lot of feminists are upset when people say like i'm an
egalitarian they'll be like oh you should be you should just be a feminist why are you doing that
you know because i just don't like what the term implies and then they'll be like but they do the
same thing so he calls himself a pain girl so anything's possible yeah so a feminist message
nowadays that's being injected into pop culture does not perfectly equate to a message about
equality okay but that's what he's taking there is like how dare you object to you know feminist
propaganda because it's all about equality like no you should take it by case by case
and have a look at what the you know message is actually implying um but again he likes to uh
make false equivalents and broad statements and straw manning and things i don't know what you
mean share this video has been gloriously honest and straightforward and logical i'm i'm just
shocked at how accurately he gets my points yeah the fact that women would need propaganda means
there's a disparity it's fine women do not want propaganda are you talking about yeah
we've never met like a woman in your life that is proactive that that gets shit done
because i don't know man like those poor women they need star wars to tell them they could do
better in life and how just literally that is we get it i shouldn't have even made the video
you're never gonna learn yeah you can tell the way you uploaded this he was like i hope this was good
i hope something happened in this video you don't get it we've already established that
that's okay keep not getting it we're we're not gonna that's not how you get people to get okay
just say you hate women that's not everyone i want to unpack that a bit okay because anyone is free
to enjoy star wars but that is not an equivalent thing to saying star wars is for everyone there
are certain uh elements and beats in that story in which caters it to a certain audience okay
that doesn't mean it's for everyone in fact you would say because it's action adventure and stuff
like that originally perhaps a larger male audience enjoyed star wars over over women
enjoying it just like interestingly enough more women tend to like pride and prejudice than men
and like i can read pride and prejudice and acknowledge it is one of the best written novels
of our time okay but guess what even though pride and prejudice probably structurally
um sociologically and all these elements of to how deep it gets into
the uh so many you know commentaries on certain things i could say that pride and prejudice is
far more technically um uh completed and executed so it's a better written book or story than star
wars but guess what i like star wars more because i like laser swords just just saying you know like
space wizards you just admit right about you yeah i must be a child because i actually like
space wizards right and that is because people do tend to like different things and surprisingly
enough there is some um similarity between the things that men like men sun sun surprising i know
tend to like things as other men and women tend to like similar things as some other women
it's not universal but it does happen you actually fall into general standards of what
men and women like differently and standards are sexist well it just amazes me that people
try and argue this so obvious fact of life that men and women tend to like different things on
average yes a woman is more than free to like star wars that doesn't mean star wars was particularly
catered to appeal to women more than men it's not pride and prejudice pride and prejudice is a movie
about space wizards intended for clearly it must be sexist there are people out there who literally
have been basically brainwashed into thinking that there's absolutely no difference at all
between men and women well any sort of simultaneously argue that men ruin everything so
yeah i know the very premise of this video is implying there's a difference between men and women
well i mean i guess you would agree because it's easier to talk about star wars with uh with women
these days you know they don't hate hate is bad like to yeah so i mean i would i would
flatly disagree with him with the statement that star wars is for everyone no anyone is free to
like star wars that's true but it's not made so everyone will enjoy it because i know a lot of
people who really love pride and prejudice regency romances who think star wars is stupid as anything
yeah some people like pred and prejudice and they're totally straight
a good meme here finds the extra credits meme with the if you don't like dizzy stars you're
a bad he didn't ask for it but i guess this was a suggestion for Freudian
a depiction yeah that one's good
good old patrick making it back into tabletop game about land wizards intended for children
and then of course because needs it needs a visual representation
what about sea wizards though they've missed the sea wizards and uh i guess land sea space what
else could we get is that the three important elements i think they're the three big minds
an air wizard limitless potential for the truly truly land wizard space wizard i like that art
that's very cute supposed to be about creating a universe it is for everyone what is that what is
that aerial picture no it's not fringe um you can't make something that's made for everyone
like then it would have nothing in it like as soon as you add anything into a story you're adding
something that just through you know dispersion is going to fall into categories of certain groups
of people demographics tend to appreciate it more than others it's like i was gonna say my mom does
not like star wars at all and probably never will she really gets turned off immediately by like
exactly these lasers and tips and stuff she's just like this is certainly not made for her if
you wanted to make a star wars movie for her it's not going to look a thing like star wars is it
but shad it's for everyone it's clearly for everyone i'm curious i talked about it in my
ea survey video but these people they're they just want to change things so that like literally
everybody will play them and everybody will like them and is it so bad that we have certain things
that only appeal to certain people yeah no that's not bad at all but it's sexist or and racist and
stuff if it is because because you know you shouldn't make something that's intended for
a female audience or a male audience because you need to be inclusive but if you try and make
something that everyone will like you'll make something no one likes i just realized one when
something is that um the wrinkle in time is not meant for white people well white men at least
it's meant for black people that's what she meant so i guess not every well i wonder what
this guy would have to say about that yeah when you have a a a series like star wars like star trek
like anything any video games especially and they're predominantly male that's the problem
it's always a problem if something is predominantly male that's an issue that's a problem even youtube
being predominantly male that's a problem but whenever something is predominantly female
they never bad and i about it there's no issue there's no problem only when something is mostly
male is it wrong is it a problem that sewage workers are mostly male right no it's a problem
that there aren't enough women ceos yeah we mentioned that last time it's just
none of this shit stands up to scrutiny it's so contradictive bad because they aren't for everyone
luke and the jedi are good because they are for everyone but they're not for the sith
they're not for the sith sorry and the empire does seem to want to conquer everyone they want
everyone under yeah they want to unify everyone they so the empire seems pretty inclusive in that
regard it's uh it's such a i don't think i've even heard this take about star wars before you know
it's like that was just for everybody this is proven by the rebels being for everyone and the
empire being anti everyone except slave children yeah they can't be saving them even the people
that make the films so they don't owe anything to the old fans from 40 years ago so they're not
even trying to make the films for everyone yes were they evil no sorry what was the mace windu
picture for oh no uh were they evil no the sith want to rule everything which is which is evil and
wanting to rule everything isn't inherently racist
or is it inherently evil you could be very much uh interested in creating the best world for
everybody fucking bran wanted to be king in game of thrones most people seemed to think that he
was a good guy and then he's taking the thing that like it's an assumption it's not ever stated in
star wars canon to my knowledge that the leaders of the empire or the sith can only be humans or
of certain race because again darth maul disproves the sith thing they have no problem having powerful
you know sith members of other races and i i'm sure if mace windu went to the dark side that
he would have been welcomed with open arms and no one would have said nah he's not allowed in
because it's black so yeah yeah they'd be like yeah man we we got low numbers you you can give
us a hand so again he's making assumptions and then trying to qualify his argument based on
things that are not rule everything which is evil and also racist because they want their
people to rule everything the jedi did not rule this video has no points that is a very
point thing to say that the jedi didn't rule yeah like what would you say is the point for you
technically the jedi tried to uh you know usurp a uh legally established government like even though
it was a bad decision the empire was voted for and stuff um and so yeah yeah the idea that the
jedi didn't want to rule i was like they no i'm not i'm not buying that i'm not saying it's evil
i'm not saying it's evil to want to rule but man they don't say they didn't want to rule
yeah they were quite supremacist in their um in the uh uh enforcement of their ideology um
hey maul where are you up to because because when you paused at mine kept playing
oh you just say mine camp
uh eight eight fifty i'll just draw it back go to 850 yeah i'm at nine because they want their
people to pull you back yeah yeah people to rule everything the jedi did not rule over the galaxy
again these are the messages and things that you can learn and then you apply them and
guys guys outstanding drama series game of thrones one oh uh yeah
wow what can you say what can you do what was it there are they accepting the award
all right then what a sad state of affairs the best drama
how can they honestly deliver that with the outcry they saw from everyone
like do you think it's just fixed yeah they're rigged they're totally rigged like is then
because like this is what i mean like never have i seen more of a disconnect it's like why are you
doing that when you know that everyone hated it what are you what are you doing
now let me double check because now i want to confirm because i went to wikipedia and it said
that let me double check oh yeah no gamma thrones won gamma thrones won best drama series right now
like uh that's the only one i think it didn't win writing uh writing or just a show called
succession i mean you know what outstanding it it made an impression i can say that much
it did stand out that is true tension filled seeing how terrible it would get
but i mean that how funny is that it's so widely considered to be bad and yet it won
it's like um remember the whole um fix beer and love beat saving private ryan
and like everybody was just like how yeah i'm just like
i mean it's kind of the same for me like la confidential came out the same year as titanic
it's just like la confidential is better i don't know what to say it's better movie
it's true to one um chin over one outstanding limited series that's okay i'm yeah that works
uh yeah now here here are the wins so comedy series is a show called fleabag that i've never heard of
um that's that's the robot from solo is it what do you mean yeah it's it's that actress she writes
that show yeah the one that they're bringing on to james bond oh uh here's one peter dinklage
won for terry and lannister for game of thrones episode the iron throne for outstanding supporting
actor what he was he just stood around well well there's there's two two things i would
reference for doing some decent acting but i seriously doubt i would have given it to denarius
uh instead of him i feel i felt really bad familiar clark throughout episode five because
she's doing it don't just to portray that character it reminds me of luke in tlj it's
like you're doing such a good job and that's so sad i know my respect for mark hamill has grown
tremendously with the amount of crap he had to put up with and he did his best to you know stay true
to like and he even made the you know comments and stuff that i'm sure disney just lost their crap
about um he's a true fan mark hamill and i feel sorry for what he had to go through but he did
it he did what he had to i mean he was contracted i imagine he had no choice true but he could have
he could have phoned him sorry yeah yeah it's true oh well let's let's carry on it's like
learning you can do it through movies and tv shows by listening to the message and you are
you're you're saying you're going on the internet i'm losing star wars i'm losing star wars look at
what yeah because it's turning to shit yeah it's turned into shit he seems very invested in the
idea of disseminating information from it through discussion and learning and growing and stuff it's
like i wonder if you'd actually be willing to hear out anybody's criticisms for these films
from a bunch of woman haters i doubt it yeah why bother he he in this video said like oh yeah
you guys don't get it why bother so did this idiot learn about racism through the last jedi
because he's saying you can learn things from these films this is where he gets all these
learning from i think i think he learned that racism is not good from star wars
and you know at least you got the message something you never had star wars okay it was
never yours because you don't get it it was never yours because you don't get it wow what
a what an actual prick what worthless human being jesus christ i'm so glad that these people i'm so
glad he's inside okay it was never yours you didn't get it because i'm arguing against a straw
man that doesn't exist and he just doesn't get it this is hilarious yeah i don't really have much
to say other than just like god look at you look at you go and that is okay and if you would like
to get it join us in conversation you'd like to get it agree with by just really feels like you
know a dark side come join us yeah this is like this is like a propaganda film if you would like
to believe you may give us thumbs up and subscribe he's essentially saying you will not be a bad
person if you i will teach you if you don't join me you are inherently a bad person you're evil
come join us don't attack us it's a logical fallacy to attack us oh my god you guys were
slightly ahead of me let me play it for the audience so you just lose your argument from
the ghetto okay sorry he's doing i think i know what he said don't attack us it's a
logical fallacy to attack the individual in an argument oh my god i can't believe it i can't
believe it holy crap he's been doing that the whole video vilifying and just minimizing everyone
to dislike star wars as evil bad men who have these retarded rednecks they're they're racist
they're sexist because you dislike this you are that you hate women you hate women if you dislike
star wars you said that multiple times the fucking cajones on this motherfucker this shit youtuber
just just because this seems like the moment to probably remind everybody
leave him alone don't do anything to him because he's the kind of person that would
probably love to have a bunch of comments to screenshot but on his twitter for how
men are ruining star wars so leave him alone that's just what he wants yep
what amazing how the lack of self-awareness we're reaching celestial levels of lack of
self-awareness might even say it's pretty epic it is very epic and so you just lose your argument
from the get-go have a conversation no that doesn't mean you lose the argument he just said
by that definition he lost the argument from the get-go because he is doing ad hominem constantly
and attacking the people he disagrees with so good he thinks he lost the argument by his own words
and logic oh my goodness points have actual reasons facts have some examples how can how can
he say any of this you're like the opposite of all the things you just said actual facts he
watched this back and thought yep this is good i'm putting this up good lord that could point to
better options that they could have chosen the film that is funny thing people have been doing
since the fucking movie came out you mongoloid exactly there's legions of people rewriting it
it seems like i don't know how he could have missed the thousands of people who have done
exactly what he's saying that they should do is like talk about what they could have done better
what specifics were wrong and just interpret all the criticism and response to last jedi as they
didn't like it you're different you just hate women it's just something different you didn't
understand the themes oh my goodness wow how do you be this person
the cognitive dissonance but he's just blissfully unaware
it is insane how we can say wine and complain what have you done through this whole video
except why did your video was called men are ruining star wars
like this is the peak of widening and you're one of them
about losing star wars just as telling everyone that you never had star wars and you don't get
star wars wait i thought it was different though so is it different or is it the same and we never
got it i don't understand and again coming from the guy who said the the prequels are already
different so what does the same even mean like what does it even mean to be just mad about who
you are and you know what oh jeez it's about we're mad about who we are now he's trying to do
the whole righteous compassionate armchair psychologist you know you have a lot of hate
for something maybe you hate yourself no the hubris oh this is astral he's got a lot of balls
for someone with no good arguments and no balls and no balls and no balls yes
what can you even say you know like this this video has been
incredibly bad for the about a type of brain wreck this has reached new levels for me like i uh
oh god what are you new to efap god uh i know i should have expected but i haven't been on an
efap where we have looked at a video like this that's i guess that's the difference for me
we'll be there for you i'll still be there for you i will talk to you i will communicate we
would love to talk to you but you won't go on you won't come with us you would whatever this guy is
won't let me know if you want to come onto efap to discuss how men are ruining star wars me and rags
will be happy to talk about it with you i am a man or at least i identify as such as do i gas mask
man is still a man well we will go through each of your points and your facts i will reply to your
messages i will try to give you my point of view and i would like to know your point of view because
i'm not going to ban you i'm not going to ignore you i'll hear you out but you could be wrong and
i might be wrong and that's okay but we need to hear you does this not feel like we're listening
to a completely different person now i know yeah who are you when did you come you just told me
that because i'm a man i'm ruining star wars because like i'm a man and now you're like we
just need to understand each other and come together and just like i i suppose that we will
we supposedly hate women because we dislike last jedi um gosh but he's here for us and communicate
and not attack it's just so exhausting it's ruining star wars no the shitty movies are
ruining star wars you just need to go whether or not these are ruining star wars whether or not
this man has an argument with some other guy on twitter does not affect star wars i guess
stars will be fine what the hell it's not fun join me and make star wars fun again no we want
it to be good not fun exactly yes let's make it good again yeah it's let's get good sorted
then we'll worry about fun assuming it isn't fun as a result it's shit but is it fun does it make
no sense at all is it literally nonsensical oh sure it's fun i don't know we have a lot of fun out
of the last jedi yeah we have tangentially i was gonna say it couldn't make it any more fun at the
moment i know more people i'm not gonna make a video thinking back to that red light video
quiz the loonie tunes of star wars yeah sure is fun who are these fucking insane nothing makes any
sense i'm sure someone's having fun by not attacking each other over star wars but by talking about
the thing that we obviously really love and are passionate about because that's why you're going
on videos that you already know you don't agree with and commenting it's because you're passionate
and you love it we heard you out we didn't just yeah your your video is fucking garbage mate like
you should be you should be ashamed of this this is really bad i had a better view of you before
i'd listen to this video so there we go but this is the moral posturing after everything you've
seen oh regardless of everything i've said listen to this of it too wouldn't it be nice if we were
just better people and we can all just work better people i i really i really don't like this
implication that you're worse because of the opinion that you have on star wars if you enjoy
star wars you're a better person wow so guess what your mother is a terrible person
um no redemption there sorry mom walking on the internet told me that uh you're a badman
that's insane amazing i'm always amazed with these people like does he think he lives in a
bubble because there's not people like this actually around him like where or does he know
people that men that hate women like i just and why is it always the most pathetic looking people
yeah the first to morally posture to you about how terrible and awful you are
i did his dad not hit him enough or too much something happened not enough not enough
it's one of the situations where drop down the stairs and the stairs was really long
i like to fight with the staircase and the staircase one
i want the video to finish the dead coming in going i fucking told you about wearing that t-shirt
uh leave a comment down below and tell me what you think i want to continue this discussion hit
the dislike hit the like it's okay it doesn't matter just like because it's your opinion and
you're allowed to have no our opinions don't matter opinion could be right
oh your opinion he said opinions don't matter didn't he say that in the video
he's doing like a boilerplate sort of response that he has at the end of every video he doesn't
remember what he said in this video like it reminds me of um the whole when people say like
everything i say in this video is subjective and then later on they'll say something like you cannot
deny that blah blah blah blah blah you'll be like i thought you said it was subjective like he
shouldn't have any grounds to complain about the you know this video response because he's been
inviting it now is he he wants the interaction and the feedback so he should have no problem
coming on efap bye double hand wave what was his point oh well that's that yeah what was his point
there was no racist event like you're ruining star wars if you don't like the new movies
uh you don't like women if you don't like the new movies um and you should make it fun again
um that i that's what i'm getting oh that star wars is about uh racism and that's you know
oh yeah it should make you a better person better person like him who openly vilifies people who
disagree with him uh that's what star wars is about i think that these are the takeaways that
i got from his lunch man is the the pinnacle of morality there's no more virtuous than i
um the guy who made this video there's nothing more virtuous than liking star wars
but i i thought at the start he he didn't want to hear about the problems or if he didn't like it
you mean to just shut up and go away and then he finishes with come and talk to me about it
like yeah you're sending me mixed messages here man i'm not sure what i'm meant to do next
yeah the first 90 percent of your video makes me feel like the last 10 percent
kind of a fucking lie
additional law there so we got our our sea wizard and air wizard
huh very good only a little bit made wizard
and remember this needs to expand we need like a trailer park wizard a city wizard you know and
someone's wizard you got to get a swamp with someone someone said the chat pinball wizard
so that was a good idea there's a wizard you got to get the biomes in now volcano wizard
and remember if any piece of media has any of these they're automatically children
yeah and and are immune to logical criticism because it's all fantasy
anyway so it shouldn't be taken seriously logical about a sea wizard
yeah we have what if what if you're really a wizard in real life you should never be taken
seriously then i'll take a real is it serious yeah so is the bible for children
nope for mine jesus was totally a wizard right he was a land wizard
but he was a sea wizard because he could walk through water oh shit i might be the
i might be the only practicing christian here but that's one valid way of interpreting it i think
you know he's a wizard the kids then so he's a soul bender bible is about a sea wizard and
doesn't have to make sense because it's a sea wizard story um but yeah i was gonna say we did
plan to watch another video i don't know how much time have i got any of you for now oh yeah i'm
reaching the limit i could probably pull out another hour or two at the most he said two
hours you heard him he said two hours you heard him a couple of hours like the limits in the air or
two and fringy yeah ah oh i'm not sure i actually have like work i need to do at some point today
well that should probably get into the the super chat part so at least i can get a few out maybe
that address some people specifically rather than uh yeah um but i mean it literally we're at five
hours almost and uh oh jeez we took an hour and 17 minutes on intro i think and that means that
that video 11 minute video took um oh that next one we're not gonna finish we're not gonna finish
that next one no i'm saying that we have to save that for another time dakus yeah that's fine what's
the next video just so i know because if it's juicy well it was it was a content creator talking
about like the nature of opinions oh i'd love that that's yeah but like i said that that one
could probably go for a whole leaf up because yeah i was gonna say it could take a long time
but if you guys are leaving it an hour that we probably might not be able to fit we might have
to do super chats and uh yeah and sign off but uh all right i'll try and be available for the next
time yeah well we'll i'll put it on the like a back burner because it's a timeless discussion
as i'm sure it is i actually really like the phil the philosophical implications of all that
stuff it doesn't really get into that in the video unfortunately the thing is we can you know so it'll
be fine yeah um it's just it's just so interested to see all everyone's different takes on uh
how we should all speak to each other i guess because of course not everyone's going to agree
because see how it goes regardless because everybody's doing like all takes on subjectivity
as well how can you criticize something definitively and some of that bad man
those people will die in your opinion it's interesting how uh deeply um almost
sociological these concepts are about the the negative kind of backlash and attack on
objective standards and being reviewing things objectively and how it can even be linked back
to the fact that no one can be bad at anything and everyone has to be a winner and stuff and how
dare you criticize or offend anyone and all these things and it's really affecting fundamental
philosophical standards i mean my goodness i mean it's good just you know even the fact that
people are still willing to have the conversations at least without far opposed to just locking it
off i mean still there's still people who do people were like i will not listen to you because
you're a bad man yeah like they are associating criticism with personal attacks and that they're
you're being you're a bad person he hates women then because you say raise a mary sue it's like
no there are lots of and it's you'd think that it doesn't take that much thought to realize how
disingenuous and contradictory they're being like all the comments that were trying to claim that
captain marvel was under the first female action heroes and people just hated that it was going to
be a woman's like are you kidding me we're like oh i it's hard for me to understand how people
could come to a conclusion when it's so obviously false with the basic the most basic level of
consideration on the matter when you look at all these other female action heroes that heaps of
men have loved for years and then they come out with these grossly incorrect things i just can't
understand it politics yeah i was actually going to say the uh the most commonly i see is they
really want to find out your politics as soon as possible just so they know that they can stop
listening oh yeah because once you're a part of the bad team then any idea that comes from you is
is originating from a rotten set of values anyway label and dismiss that's what i always say is
what they're all about label and dismiss it's just crazy it like even from my own sort of
perspective is an up-and-coming youtuber when i i knew about all this stuff like seeing discussions
online where people are like this is what one of mauler's politics like why why is everyone obsessed
with knowing what what policies i hold on student elements like i'm talking about that it's like they
need to know whether or not they can take you seriously um yeah i was just setting up the um
got a whole series of 8-bit images
good old mr this is this is like 8-bit art if you will
and dad oh i feel very very impressed it looks like uh looks like mega man
oh yeah i think i think that might be maybe what it's basing it slightly on it looks like mega man's
jump very cool this would be robot head doing they're not entirely sure of what your body would
look like so no that's pretty accurate that's pretty good except for the night genitalia but
maybe next day you did mention your attachments this would be
theo so you guys may not get every one of these because there's some guests you
i don't know
smylar al creepy face so
is that what his is that what his body's like um he's got another drawing of fan art that gave him
a body like that so i guess it's becoming canon that would be his body i i you know i can't control
these things smud boy with his based on the um mass effect dude so
the mass effect dude that's correct ringy ah that's good that's good i like that i'm saving that
that was a good one mr tro himself
blue iron man that is for tear until he figures out exactly what he wants to do with his pfp
he could adopt that one who knows
and then of course there is me and i think i have the infinity gauntlet done okay with this
mr eight-bit wolf
yeah that's a good one yeah yeah yeah i like that one nicely like shaded as well
and eight-bit rag
there you go
i think they're the last bonus one the one that we all really wanted to see
was uh bike rags with the dawn riding it
yay this is uh the lore is complete this is something that somebody sent me let me double
check the uh lesia blackbird in this one i like it yeah that's really good that's good
i really like that oh wow really like efap fan artists i'm all like me fan art that is great
oh yeah i'm cool with sharing that is it a fan of your channel has uh made it is it uh i guess so
yeah um i probably mispronounced the name it was lesia blackbird thank you that's that's great
i really like that hopefully they know that you uh you're on this stream so i could see you
reacting to it well pat it got sent to me by uh someone else it wasn't sent by uh it was sent
by glib oh sorry but he said that it was from her or him i'm not sure i don't know that's what i mean
but it's it's great well we hate women so i hope it's a he those women they need propaganda in order
to like and dislike things i don't know what it's a he sorry i fucked that up
thanks though all right then i'm gonna start reading out some super chats here we go
maula do you agree that we should ban death
um what do you guys think banning death but i mean banning yeah the reaper or the condition
that comes upon us at the end of our life we can do that legally right it prevents it
all right i just don't know why they haven't banned it it's shit
you'd think morally speaking they would have banned it by now death bad so yeah we're gonna
have to get some star wars movies to reaffirm that for us because maybe some people think death good
hi rags hello hey muesli how goes brexit
um uh from from my understanding not great i i i i'm just waiting to see what happens
i was just saying there would be no efap this week no just uh just a late one um hello shad
oh hello boy muesli iron man three and unbridled praise when it wouldn't be a praise
but uh i do actually want to make that video someday i'm not sure in what way it would come
out one day oh sweet sunday efap thanks notification
oh dear don it's three aussies versus one long britain may the cosmic chicken have made it
see on us all no no this is a team effort we teamed up it was no britain versus aussie
australia yeah we're allies technically australians are just secondhand brits so
oh you guys are happier to be there than with us i don't know let's get your own
island with crazy monsters on it well that's true i do get to fight the monsters your own jurassic
parks nice efap without burping every five minutes also hi you saying that rags is a burper
i haven't had really any sody pop or anything but yeah there there has not been a lot of burpage
going on try to get that secret at one point once i pretty much once i got home i came to efap so
yeah i didn't expect you to be able to make it but you did which is yeah i'm glad you could
have seen that video it was uh that was terrible holy fuck don't you feel more fulfilled from
having seen it i feel so much more self-confident about myself i'm glad it's another one of those
videos that just makes me so glad that i'm me and not them and who is this mysterious that
the man oh that that might be giving him a lot of credit the the guy in that thing with the lando
carrasian funko pop the other you'll never let that go will he the dude had a lando carrasian
funko pop what the fuck um how do you do that and not even the right lando yeah it was shitty
donald glover glover glove lando donald glover glover glover um robot fucker
there's this there's two more memes i'm gonna show even though i've got a collection of memes
for another for another stream potentially but i do actually want to show these because i think
i think me and rags will definitely both of them this is the first one right i'm sure you're gonna
love it oh no oh he asked if he draws beautiful at one point shadow mire drew me beautiful
shadow mire did draw you beautiful yes uh it drew me so beautiful
i've forgotten this is efapopoli and um the dog with the hat yay you got me in the car which
makes sense skull wheels dog and hat velociraptor slash t-rex you mean hat hat on dog jay is the
shoe um i guess if we go around from the top left you go free parking from uh the dawn which
i think that's perfect but let me try and fit this on screen
uh an orphans spider fortune sword like say sword like on onject objects this is onjacked
right i think that's supposed to be object uh yellow pole nice artist subjective and the other
trains are themes space wizards for children and you hate women so they're all the train stations
um verified faggill oh wow this is gonna be new then
there's sexual harassment up in the corner oh yeah that's great though would that be the
equivalent of pasco in this no pasco is collect 200 salaries you pass cosmic chicken
um verified fangirl apex homosexual looking at women hello ladies and gentlemen hello all my
n-weights hi rags so that's a good set of three fortune critical analysis subjectivity monopoly
how ironic big idiocisms you're a nazi what aboutism tax space wizards are for children
one of them's the letter six
so it's very up to date 1.2 billion just visiting artificial barriers of blockage
thus this is actually really well put together reference wise i'm i'm impressed
racetisms elevator music good rat mary sue narrative tripling kick j funneled look
the fast dealing criticism trading card game yeah well i mean it would probably work out
pretty much make a monopoly out of anything like it good shit um all right uh what is what is
what is yellow pole that is sausage man sausage dude oh right gotcha guy
captain marvel's powers is just super saiyan minus the years of work mastery application
talents that a lot of characters from dragon ball did to earn it that was celestially epic
oh there's two for shad but i think he's popped out for seven oh wait till he comes
anymore any plans on making a video on a metroid game also a favorite metroid game
uh it's tough to choose between metroid prime and super metroid but they're my favorites
and yeah i'd like to make a video on metroid sometime i did i don't know how long it
would take because i'd want to do everything and make sure i cover exactly
me and frick have been watching some uh metroid analysis videos lately it's been great yep
yep not all shit star wars more like incorrect wars no we watched one
i have to start collecting these bad ones
i think i've got some back i'm back ah all right let me look at my backlog of shad questions
that i saved um hello shad have you read stormlight archive
have i i'm consulting for brandon sanderson on his next stormlight book so yes i have okay
all right just make sure correct me if i've read this before i feel like i might have but it says
if so who's your favorite character and why is it dalena
uh because it is dalena is right uh dalena is just uh like i love how you know strong he is
how authoritative and sure and is just a decently good character who gets tested really in a hard
way and comes out on top and he still struggles and is just a good leader and so yeah brilliant
character i love it um dad what are your thoughts on all seven lightsaber forms if you know them
see my thoughts are like they seem to only have stances and then they go into kind of a vague way
of describing how they fight without going into detail what the specific moves are now that can
be a safe way to do it because if someone who is unfamiliar with sword fighting tries to explain
in detail you attack this specific way from the sword movement distraction distraction
can sometimes like write or create some very bad styles of fighting having said that i haven't
looked into it in detail so if there is that level of detail i'm just completely contradicting
uh my understanding of it uh or just how it is depicted they recommend checking out
jen sari's video on it okay i might have to have a look and they'd love to know your thoughts on
your favorite slash best duel from star wars i've been actually thinking about that recently i'm
going to launch a new series on my channel called fight scene autopsy or i actually plan to break
down iconic fight scenes frame by frame you can kind of guess where i got my inspiration for that
um but really like it the most detailed fight scene breakdown analysis that i can do and i'm
going to start with the last july throne room scene but then i'm going to move to um fight
scene between obi-wan and anakin and then darth vader and luke skywalker and then i'll expand
to other you know pop culture stuff fight scenes and things so at the moment it's hard for me to
say but it would be a fight between anakin versus obi-wan or luke versus darth vader but i need to
give them a much closer look to compare all right sounds good it's good to look forward to you
um and this is a saved question i had for you fringy what's your favorite daredevil season
minus three but one is a close second from uh probably season one i think it'd go one three two
um i think two two's kind of hard because the punisher stuff like daredevil and punisher stuff
is really great but the hand stuff is a little bit it's a bit iffy um they all kind of have problems
but i do think it would go one three two uh i think three is pretty good and one is probably
my favorite and so that does it for the old questions i need to make sure you're asking now
back with the thing was actually i'm going to cover all of the stream labs things i've missed
uh i'll just go from seven days back maybe uh five of them just before you do that malam
i'm gonna take off i only thought i could stay two or three hours so i'm glad it worked well
before you go would you like to maybe talk a bit about your channel and why everybody in the chat
should subscribe to you yes come subscribe robot head where uh we'll make fun of movies star wars
game of thrones i've got a second channel now robot head reload where i'm gonna upload some
live streams and some extra content and i've got membership on the channel now if anyone wants to
come and be a member but um thank you again for having me and once i work at what i'm doing with
the live stream you'll have to come on so yeah let's have me and rags on at the same time it'll
be a nice little cross yes well that's what i'm hoping so jay pointed out a video of someone
ripping into one of my videos i might have to copy the efap format and just get you all over for it
oh go for it i i see it as encouraging the idea of conversation uh like cynical people
might see it as bullying or something but i mean in the aid of actually trying to open up a dialogue
maybe a few insults get thrown maybe a little bit of anger and animosity is spread but ultimately
hopefully some answers are reached and you can defend yourself which would be uh good for you
i imagine yeah i'd like that i'd like to see what they say i haven't watched it yet because i want
to wait for the prize to see what they say so uh yeah we might have to do that one day but the rest
of you enjoy the rest of your day and thank you again for having me on thanks for coming man it's
been fun no worries i shall speak to you i shall speak to you all soon see ya bye bye you can find
a link to his channel in the description good old mr robot head i believe that's his third appearance
now he's climbing that ladder know how it be um happy birthday to shad i love your videos and

chose wisely i know it's pretty awesome like crazy so it's really cool yeah um
how did rags not see pacific rim one this i i haven't seen it yeah it happens
all right there's a lot of them i haven't seen most movies uh they said hi by the way
oh hello oh the dawn is in it that's true actually yeah i forgot he's actually in that film
um a limerick there once was a long man who's bad a wolf and a doggo named rag there being the
toxic brood demand for things to be good drove people objectively mad that works
um yeah i don't i don't even a donation for mental may he be able to buy
more porn tisms and they maybe it's metal yeah i so you know genres of porn he was he was blissfully
unaware of um of nugget of a variety of what that refers to i don't even know what that is
well it's better that people don't probably and and his his chat were very surprised
i guess since we just went over how rags didn't see pacific rim there's lots of things people
just don't know about and we have to accept that but i will i will make a note um i think
that was from the stream i did with him on uh friday yeah um happy birthday shad oh thank you
very much also hi rags hello like there could be
wait you're in greece
are you asking what my weight is in greece or what somebody's weight is in greece i don't
i'm failing on the reference in greece this is weight you're in greece
i'm not sure what is the chance the simpsons goes on for so long it unironically becomes good again
i mean it's possible maybe
but i was supposed to be reading the uh dream labs ones uh right uh what is up all my n words also
high rags hello oh hi hey hello hi lord of the rings battles often end with one trump card

also hi j kick metal rags have you activated windows yet
i think i do have an activated windows on my computer yeah pretty sure yeah did you not before
i'm pretty sure i also did yeah i don't actually know where that's coming from
i think is uh i think they swap them all around the idea is high rags kick kick j and metal have
you activated windows maybe because it says i think i think it's supposed to just be a fuck up
up of things somebody hasn't activated windows i don't think it's rags i'll be right back in just
a second then zapping my ninja turtle so annoying which is a reference to tonals all right they're
caught up uh which curse is worse having teeth that slowly grow hair or having facial hair that
bleeds when you shave it clearly mr probably depends how much blood probably
because teeth that slowly grow hair that sounds uh sounds really horrible convenience yeah
how does it come off do you have to like shave that i'd probably take the the bleeding assuming
it's not too much just bleed when you shave probably um hey molar i've been watching your
content since before efap was created i've been able to stay caught up until now i'm leaving for
marines boot camp i expect several efaps that i can binge when i get back oh there will be

hi mauler bye mauler hi bye good night you massives i'll return during breakfast
yeah this is pretty late for a lot of people uh i'm gonna get drunk and enjoy the fab also
hi rags hello in the is the inside of a zebra's butt black or white i assume it'd be black
because it's dark yeah possibly i haven't checked nor have i asked a scientician in the field
the answer is surely to be found the rat in scott's van was not cgi but real does this
indeed make good rat i feel like the answer to what makes good rat is much more complicated
i certainly believe that rat yes there's gonna be a lot of uh a lot of work to do in terms of
science to figure out what makes good rat ultimate i believe that rat we're gonna wait a while get a
lot of testimony as brown table made any more videos about working with good rat because he
was kind of our go-to guy for source information failed us in that
maticulations ah hello there
you legend oh my god an australian friendly timed efap take my money
oh see australian audiences all pop it out tonight there you go these happen more often
well we'll do the australian triple threat again sometime i think it works out
um hi rags hello hey are you ever gonna have griffin gaming or it's a gundam on efap as a guest
uh not against it i'm not sure who griffin gaming is i've heard of it's a gundam but i
don't know uh what they do or what the channel is but again we're not opposed to pretty much
any guest most also i love your voice it makes me pee pee hard aw adorable my dream fab all
ozzie's mauler slash rags the nirvana song they should have used for captain marvel um
is there a nirvana song called rape me i doubt it i don't know they said they should have used me
happens if someone is requesting why won't you mean it's not technically rape just well they're
requesting that that's the song be used because that's how they felt watching captain marvel
apparently okay also chat chat we're all saying there is and yes oh okay goes to show everyone's
knowledge of nirvana apparently oh i don't know shit about nirvana yeah i don't either one of their
best songs all right now if you guys thought ray's folding saber was silly then look up the
lightsaber whip i would take a lightsaber whip over his silly lightsaber i feel like a lightsaber
whip could be i feel like a challenge accepted i feel like i'm gonna kill myself with a lightsaber
whip that sounds insanely dangerous yeah if you're not talented with a lightsaber whip
or you got to be oh my god they have the force rags oh man they got
rags doesn't have faith in them i don't have faith in them there's so much
hey rags enjoyed your brown table video will you work on a video about esr b giving the
latest nva game an e rating instead of t for simulated gambling
hmm thanks oh well i don't i don't know anything about it maybe if they did well because of course
they did because there's no way they're gonna act the esr b's got lord knows the kind of money
that's being funneled into the esr b but i mean the idea that you can have you can have actual
gambling i mean there's like slot machines in the whole nine yards so it's it's absolutely
messed up that this would have a kid's rating on it i'm not surprised because of course they would
they're not gonna they're not gonna put a t rating on an nba game especially would not win this big
some high rags hey it was super smart of fin to drag rose back to the base with him
her massive form easily covered his tracks in their wake oh that's i didn't think about it that
way that's good yeah was it some cover from fire as well yeah duck wolf introduced me to rags rags
introduced me to bowler bowler introduced me to efap efap introduced me to jay jay made me quit youtube
oh yay yay also uh have a fap where y'all get drunk because that would be extra very entertaining
and also lovely weather we have i don't know what else to say um i every time critical drinkers
come on i've i've been drinking alcohol i'm pretty sure we did the two-parter with him rose i was
pretty drunk we've done it it's happened um i don't get why they didn't have mara jade in the movies
if you want to have a good female character there's one on a platter i don't think they're
ideas of what makes a good female character yeah with what with the normal persons we're the
talented person yeah with someone who's right yeah everyone forgot looper even existed until
after glj came out and now knives out is getting all this praise before it came out yeah i don't
buy it i don't buy it either we'll have to give that a bit of time because uh i'm curious see if
it's truly a 100 kind of film you know i'm sure it is i'm sure it's that good uh i'm gonna be
i'm gonna be a little bit skeptical about it uh people who say belch when they burp should be burned
what do you mean i don't know that's all it says
more is it i don't know i don't know about that one more is it just the mind controlled
troopers that you have a problem with or is it the awful execution of the idea
the mind control the clones are like the
uh i'm cool with clones um yeah the clones yeah but like normal the normalman the first order
soldiers yeah if you're talking about uh disney starles then yeah it's absolutely the execution
of the idea and also not really explaining how it works like how did finn become a trooper that
managed to break from the conditioning you know i go with all that my tfa part one i think but
uh if you're talking about prequel stuff i don't think i have a problem with the clones for the
most part so it says something like that patrick ulam says he doesn't regret saying you're watching
movies wrong and he says that quote is almost always taken out of context yeah i um i quote
tweeted him he says he said it was partly a joke how do you have that be partly a joke how does
that make sense you're watching movies wrong it's like that's binary it's right or wrong so how
is it that that's partly a joke that doesn't make any sense
and i actually think it would have benefited him to say it was a joke
instead of saying it was partly a joke because i'm just confused
my friend so partly a joke well he just uses that as cover yeah he absolutely meant that
oh yeah there's no way he didn't mean that that's ridiculous uh my friend saw ryan's knives out and
she doesn't care about star wars so she didn't pay attention to tlj discussion she said knives
out was terrible to be seen i am curious memes say 2019 is a year of clowns it's joker and beto
all right beto rolk i'm guessing that's a reference to yeah i think so uh let's see the ar-15 go right
he's yeah he's one of the ones that yeah speak a different language in the debates randomly right
uh i can't remember there's like three of those ones crazy authoritarian monster like he's actually
disgusting person the four beers and says this is for the aussies they can't drink it's too early
but uh well they appreciate it thank god you guys are here to cheer me up after my chicago
cubs kept blowing games also rags what would it take for you to have sex with brown table
i mean you have to be looking the other way back on his head anonymous i don't know
uh i just i don't like him he doesn't he's not a lot he doesn't come across as likable guy
or an intelligent guy you know i i really don't know if he has any qualities to my knowledge
no quality i mean like he has like height and like dimensions but i i from his videos he's so
aloof and stupid and i just i i legit i'm kind of just bit up bit at a loss
uh praise be the dawn sands is in smash hi mauler yeah i heard oh i think we mentioned that
on last efap good stuff big fans of uh undertale so yeah cool haven't efapped in a while any new
on wolf uh wolf's doing fine he's just um obviously not not on efap uh at least for the foreseeable
future is uh any updates that were like super significant that you guys would need to know
about we we would uh we would let you know no worries keep marjade away from new stalls canon
they just ruin it she's my favorite eu character don't touch her ever i was actually gonna bring
up the fact that it's like you guys sometimes suggest like they should do blah blah blah it's
like maybe don't have them destroy that thing that you like isn't it sad that our confidence
in hollywood has fallen so low that we would rather them not even attempt it like not even try
it just don't try we know you'll fuck it up just don't even do it i love you guys especially
you maulier videos have inspired me to start my own youtube channel where i talk about manga
and weaboo things good stuff one question for you all is lolly conan cp the same
no uh what what are those what what so what what's lolly what is that it's gonna be an
discuss honestly like drawn anime children okay he's asking is are they especially equivalent i'm
like no obviously because one is depiction just drawings of it of children and one is actually
children right one is obviously worse than the other yeah that's that's definitely a discussion
isn't it that'll probably be a discussion they've gone for a long time in terms of defining
parameters of everything and ethics so well i know i think no i think this is one of the
really quick easy to sum up things obviously child porn is worse than lolly con because one
is real children and the other isn't i guess it depends on what you what the basis is for good or
bad like is it bad because of what the effect is on the child of the real one or is it bad
on the principle that it's bad to you know in general because depending on how you draw the
line then it's like then it would change i mean i think they're both bad based on what
based on what i've heard about uh lolly off of that description but yeah
but that's yeah that's that's a whole topic isn't it i was gonna say i'm not touching that
shit i don't know anything about it like nope yeah um i agree with angel red 89 mara jade is
too good for disney star wars uh they would only ruin her like everything else keep her out
yeah i assume a lot of people would have that perspective uh do any of you guys listen to
hello internet they've done episodes on each of the star wars films thankfully they aren't fans
of tlj that is the cgp gray podcast uh he does with is it minute physics that the other guy
who does that um i used to listen to it i i don't know i just i didn't stock so i thought it was bad
or anything i just sort of fell out with it but um yeah it's a cool podcast and it's cool that
they've done ones on the films yeah i've heard of it haven't listened to anything from him yet
people in chat are saying dale is here who's dale i don't know what like dale from the walking
down with dale no i think he's the guy that we covered the video on i think he's all right
name was dale i didn't like it's terrible you should be ashamed of yourself
oh my goodness dale like what were you thinking how you doing dale
what's uh what's the account name is it dale or is it something else dale carnegie
um i'm just waiting to see if it pops up or not yeah i wonder if the chat might just say
someone's here for the falls just to fuck with us oh yeah that's why i'm waiting for the good
old-fashioned proof dale knows about the uh you can check anyway right you can literally just it
takes you to their channel you should yeah because the channel name is is like network 1901 or
something like that oh that could actually be him he says nah it's just it's me just recover
from all the crying of my takedown uh okay he looks like a crier
yes it's the same icon as the one from twitter and yeah uh it's a link to a channel it's like
let's play isn't it's the same guy i guess that is him if you want to jump on discord to have
a chat with us you'd be welcome to dale uh there is uh there is a link to my discord in the
description from there you can find my account on the top right and then just send me a message
and i'll get you in this conversation if you'd like to discuss how men are ruining star wars
that'd be cool yeah yeah i'd love to see you around i'm not sure i'd have the time
oh well i mean uh you don't have to stay but uh i'm assuming you'd be curious about this
very curious because i have to say like nothing against impersonal well he did make some
interestingly personal kind of you know implications in your argument there dale that i felt if you
don't want it to be personal then disingenuous um as to say the least that it would be interesting
to hear your thoughts or explanation for
dale saying anything i don't think i can't even find where did he say anything in chat i can't
see it it was it was the account was dale knows
did something about crying about his takedown
i assume that that's like sarcastic
oh well he could just be uh handling it in good fun which would be oh yeah no that's
that's fine i'm not it's uh because if he hoped in that'd be cool to just talk about it
though i too don't know how i could stick around i'm just working on like an assignment while you
read now super chats how long have you got ranks will i be alone pretty much all night all right
good stuff we'll be able to talk to dale if he if you wish i mean you said yes i can come chat
all right if you want to just oh i said just pop me a message on discord you can find my
account through the description i will get you in um do any of you guys oh wait uh molar i make
videos critiquing films by dismantling flaws i want to make videos critiquing good movies but
i don't know how to make it interesting any tips so like do you mean like explaining why good movies
are good or explaining the flaws in good movies because it's essentially the same format there's
almost like a flip though so like a lot a lot of what people like when you rip something down is
the um sort of jabs once you've explained the logic of how it doesn't make sense and then you
then you have like a maybe a hyperbolic like uh insult or something like that you try and find
the inverse so it's like you can praise it you could say like this is fucking brilliant you know
this is this is amazing this is such great work especially for things that really are like
stuff to achieve um it's not easy though i understand that i was very concerned about
my infinity wall video working because it was a praise and i do want to make more in the future so
i guess um i'm going to be experimenting with it as time goes on as well also tell everyone to
watch my videos everyone go watch evan monroe he's got an icon from blade runner 2049
i think so anyway just got a big old check from wiccan all weekend so here have some money poos
please buy everyone miss monopoly with this mube schlee oh yeah that's right that's the thing
uh hello rag old shad hello just got myself a great sword any tips on somewhat practical use
well uh interesting things but i'd i'd want to see uh what type of great sword there are many
swords that claim to be great swords but uh there are not actually great i feel like we've
uh glossed over the question of the practical use of a great sword in like uh i mean if you live in
australia it goes without saying oh yeah right snakes and emus and any other invaders
it was very well especially now it's coming up shit yeah
yeah you know keep an eye out in your shed and i mean you know you can have everyday use
when you're walking down the street and let's say a robber is trying to take someone's purse
you can bring out your great sword i think that there's there's a possible use of it in that way
just you need to have your permit for carrying the great sword of course
um love to carry a sword again in public would be great
hi robert head and fring gold australia is an inside job
um let's yeah
is a meme this
is that dale is
is yeah uh hello hey greetings
your microphone doesn't sound as good as the one in the videos
yeah yeah do you want me to change it up oh i mean we'd love to if you could
uh while he's sorting out check this out from bayouin
oh is it another
hello love brought the boss home for supper
hello i hope this hungry is his spaghetti bolognese shepherds pie
what's the thing with shepherds pie is that like uh
oh yeah it's one of efam's new memes
i love it the scream bursts the mask off
oh
that's priceless i love it
yeah i got two more i can
i feel like dale's gonna be confused as fuck when he sees this but uh
i could set it on twitter
no i had i had no idea until star wars told me
and uh i guess i made a business one before but this is obviously a reference to my ds2 videos
yeah this is better oh yeah that was the um yeah it's taking a way back
uh have you swapped microphones now yeah yeah can you hear me better that sounds the same to you
guys or no not as echoey yeah might be a little bit better yeah improvement um i mean it's probably
good enough right yeah i'd say if you want to double check that discord is using the correct
mic like if you check your settings it might yeah yeah
there's a few more uh wizards up in there
uh
trail wizard
those are all they got mentioned earlier remember
so a little toe is sticking out one of his socks
this drawing's really good to get that chalky kind of look to him yeah
yeah oh i just noticed you know the spider wizard would be uh exceptionally powerful
well yeah i mean he's got eight legs so he's got eight eight legs to cast you know spells with
um is it fixed up dale how are we looking
i uh sorry i'm just working on the assignment and i feel like i'm just uh
just like missed the thing entirely until now and i feel like i've just cost myself a lot of
time and headache over a stupid mistake we missed what i just because i've been working
i've been working on this assignment and i'm like look all the other questions are fine but there's
one and i just i couldn't figure it out and now i feel like i've i just i may have just figured
it out off of just reading correctly and having basic comprehension skills and now i'm just like
i'm losing it
there we go
as is anything progressing dale how about a microphone
oh maybe he's uh switched um i'm not sure should we just
we just carry on reading these things until he says something
oh we might have to do oh yeah we can hear you now if you switch microphones discord needs
oh hey there he is yeah there you go that sounds better that sounds better
of course i apologize good i'm good so um we we didn't enjoy your video very much
we had some disagreements either no we had some criticisms here and there uh yeah i suppose they
were good ones we uh we could start with the the title so men are ruining star wars do you
still think that's a fairly accurate statement um well like it's not it you know it's inflammatory
right what was it accurate a statement um
oh i think i think for the first obviously not right like most men are not what uh is
being projected at this time but at that time when the video was made it
it pickened um you know just leading with something provocative and just kind of more
from two exploring is and i didn't know the data just clicked on us from june 2018 so it's over a
year old yeah yeah so um yeah it was just kind of uh it was more of like a thought exercise similar
to you know but i positioned my thought exercise as kind of as like a argument and character of
the role you know well i mean maybe like what's your what's your opinion now i guess
relative to the points that you made in the video like what's your what's your position
on the on the topic as broadly defined as it is uh it's it's tricky right like you're talking
about it and um because you can have like a assertive idea beforehand and then if you
you know want to say anything different to that statement um you know it's backpedaling and all
that stuff and but um no like men are not ruining star wars right like that's obviously clearly uh
like there's there's so many men in the world as you guys pointed out um and uh yeah people i
was just at home uh watching uh some movies with the family and uh people on twitter had mentioned
that you guys were the video and um so i thought i'd come on and just uh be open to chatting about
it because that's all it was meant to do is to strike conversation absolutely i was gonna say
since shad doesn't have a lot of time is there anything you would want to ask before you don't
have a chance well yeah i mean uh first of all good on your day off for coming on and uh coming
in the lion's den as it were and uh being willing to have a chat so uh i'm impressed well good on
you thanks i had to eat a couple soy packs to get ready for it so i guess there's a couple of very
strong and uh i would almost call vilifying positions that you took just almost for granted
without really establishing their validity like you you know you had said that if you don't like
and i assume you're talking about new star wars particularly the last jedi you then don't like
women and what are your views on that statement and and now compared to then and and also how did
you get to that position because that's that's a very big thing to say yeah um so from the little
kind of segment and niche that my world revolved in being like a disney podcaster and youtuber
um and uh working with uh younger like a younger woman and uh and myself i just kind of
looked at how i was treated on the internet versus how she was treated on the internet
and i found that um this video you know the it's so backwards on this video i'm like i'm calling
out men and people are like commenting on it if you look like right people like oh that's so brave
and that's amazing um but then if you look at a video that network would make um it would be like
about her liking a character and all the comments would just be about like you're like a piece of
shit ugly whore you know shave like and just like super mean things um and uh i started meeting more
women who were running podcasts and things like that who they were being treated the same so
i had this like hyper exposure to this uh niche um and whether they're troll accounts or um which
some of them like probably a lot of them were um there was still um this distinctive role that
uh i had noticed um the people who were coming out were predominantly male
and just women's experiences being new to the fandom um uh was predominantly male but then i
would also have my point of like i enjoyed the prequels growing up and i also had to defend
myself to men who called me and who called me an idiot and said i didn't know what i was talking
about because uh i liked you know i liked the phantom menace when i was 13 right so
i just kind of related to it from that from that viewpoint so we've acknowledged that
probably they were mostly troll accounts um well i i don't i don't actually know if that's true or
not like i don't i don't have any facts or information about that but but you know what
i mean like we do know that troll accounts are a problem um you know i don't know if they're
problem um what i think is interesting is that the star wars community and especially if you
cross that over with star wars fandoms on youtube specifically it's going to be predominantly male
just demographics wise so pretty much everything that's going to happen is going to be predominantly
male anyway no and then when you but when you continue on that thought exercise right that's
always the case right like it is that um i guess the culturalization or how social um structures and
how like society is constructed right i think men are it's just mostly appealing generally to men
you know star wars the action lightsabers fights wars yeah i would i would disagree i would i
actually would i would just would disagree on that i think generally it appeals more to women
no i think that uh probably one or the other uh well
i i think that entertainment uh can be perceived or art can be perceived by whoever wants to
perceive it i didn't say that i think the uh i think the point that's being made is that
because that naturally you know any media can be can be enjoyed by anybody but they do generally
tend to be trends in terms of like most most men aren't that interested in watching like
romance films and you know most and and it's because i think with star wars it's probably
got a decent chunk that are female but it would still be like majority male interest in the same
way that majority male interest in like the mcu or lord of the rings of course right and it all
derives from the 70s and right yeah like it's all i i i i i just figure it's kind of like
predisposed to certain things like it's it probably isn't much of a surprise that
men on average tend to be more interested in action oriented um things than than women and
conversely women tend to be more interested in the interpersonal kind of like does seem to be a bit
of a universal standard we notice yes yeah and there are there's some individuals yeah there is
something like uh debate to where that trend comes from but the trend does
exist right the analytics can't lie do you uh do you think it's a problem
i think what's the problem sorry that that men are that generally star wars and
the mcu other similar universes and such you know warhammer things like that do you think it's a
it's something to be fixed or solved that it is mostly appealing to men
um well you know i grew up in a comic book store as you can tell i'm a huge geek it's uh
um uh the way it's you know just the way it is i was around men i built computers when
i was a teenager i kind of grew up in the same area my whole life and um yeah it was like all
when i was in those environments because i also did other things as well when i was in those
environments yeah it was super super predominantly males and when a girl would walk into the comic
store all the guys would be weird and like all that all that stuff um but definitely now um uh
you do see it at the comic book store like again like this is like and like this is totally
anecdotal but i you know you you're it's 50 50 and i um yeah and it's it's really enjoyable like
it's and it's enjoyable to um see now my kid um my oldest son uh play dungeons and dragons
you know in a mixed like group and not feel so uh much anxiety talking to women or or feeling
such a separation um from women i think that's super important for our genders not to be feel
super separated from each other all the time so does that boil down to a yes or no or um it's a
complex question and i'd like i don't know how comfortable i like feel making like a i don't know
like i know you guys i know i know you guys kind of like made fun of me for um being open to the
idea that i was part of the problem of like causing star wars and i'm kind of equating that to
the me too movement in the sense where we all um whether or not any man uh had committed uh
sexual sexual assault against a woman it i think it was important for all men to take a moment to
think to really think about if they if they had um and i don't have anything to feel guilty about
yeah neither do have i so um i i kind of don't like the the gendered framing thing i mean sexual
assault and stuff like yeah but i i mean i guess like it depends on what like if if you were in
hollywood and you knew about the stuff that was happening you know that that's one thing but like
i don't i have it's got nothing to do with me you know like i'm not there i haven't done anything
wrong so it was more of just a thing to observe rather than think about for me because it's like
i haven't done anything wrong you know what i mean like um yeah like when i was in height when i was
in high school uh we had a teacher who um some years later was fired um for the way he was with
women and we witnessed that in class um some of us actually had like had um received like let like
worse grades um uh because we weren't women um and this guy um was uh it was pretty bad and we we
went to the when we went to the administration staff about it um as a as a guy i was i was laughed
at yeah so sexism exists yeah sexism exists towards men and women in different situations and
circumstances and stuff um but does that does that how does that apply to that i guess the
point of discussion that's being made here necessarily um because generally if uh star
wars for instance appeals to guys more generally there's no harm that most guys tend to like that
just like there's no harm that most girls tend to like twilight and pride and prejudice and uh i
personally don't think these things need to change or should change to appeal to different demographics
or sexes because if you change twilight to appeal more to guys less girls are gonna like it because
you're changing certain like core elements away from what it originally was and decide that's kind
of some of the i guess perspective and point of view that we can't see this stuff do you think
that star wars should be changed to appeal to new demographics that aren't interested in it
originally um well i think a private company like disney um
you know if they want to make a change uh to their parks everyone who's a fan of the parks raises
their arms up there and flips out um and i think the same can be done with any of the content that
they own if they want to i didn't i didn't well research just to stop just no no hold on if they
want to do research and they want to be like hey this is a market we want to grab or we do
want to be more inclusive or we want to do these things for x number of reasons it always ending up
being for money or branding uh then then they should go ahead and do it right and if we want
to like it we we pay our money and if we don't like it we stop watching star wars and we move
on to something else you're saying they should if they can it's like the comedians right if we're
comedians you don't judge comedy you either you judge it by laughing or not laughing no yeah that's
pretty much answering the question like yeah they can do whatever they want with it no no it's not
what i asked that's why i tried to stop you need went on where i thought you were going
i'm asking you should they
right they should do whatever would make them the most money
well okay very interesting all right all right um just got also the the thing that you said about
if they don't like it they just don't watch it and stuff because in your video you went a bit
further than that you're basically saying if you don't like it you shouldn't criticize it
that's what i was getting from the video yeah i could see that um
um it problem isn't whether or not you as a man or or anybody else like star wars it was the
problem that i was highlighting was how um you handled it how people were handling it uh not you
obviously but how people were handling it after they didn't like it and some of the tirades and
attacks that they went on afterwards yeah and i guess that's kind of one of my bigger issues with
it is that equating that with everyone who dislikes star wars and i guess it's based off
your experience because i know from my experience i've never i haven't come across a single person
who um disliked the new you know movies and stuff because they dislike women in fact in fact i don't
even think i know a single man in my entire sphere who dislikes women like a true legitimate
sexist you know in in air quotes and stuff as it's defined um it just seems like a complete
caricature and that's why when you do see comments like this for eyes on the internet
usually it's done as trolling because people like to trigger other people who get really
offended easily by it um i guess it's um it's it's like an instance of uh i guess addressing a
demographic that's so small and clearly wrong that it's not even really worth discussing it
yeah like i wonder if anyone hates tlj because they hate men well okay you'd be so negligible
at that point oh it's like um i know it seems like i'm kind of walking on the fence but
like what i'd what kind of came from this video actually part of this whole discovery was me
ending up leaving uh the network um and uh was because you know um for you for you guys uh being
skeptical about um some of the things that are being said out there and and and uh going over
it and breaking it down and and obviously um thinking that uh social justice warriors have
gone too far um well i just i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it i got it from
that other side um with like the people that i worked with um you know when i had i had there's
a video that i made just like questioning whether or not kylo ren and ray was like a good healthy
relationship for people to have and um i i got the this like the same type of like super negative
reaction for and i got called an ante i got uh i got like basically it was like um like one of my
closest friends she didn't even know who i was like who are like i don't even know who you are
anymore and it i ended up that i couldn't end up working with her because it was just so impossible
because she just hated me for the rest of the time uh and all i did was like i'm just asking
the question um and uh like i'm i just like to hear people's opinions and i would yeah and and
i kind of formulate my opinions through them but sometimes it it i can um it happens after a
conversation right like we formulate our opinions after a conversation um and i'm always open to
being wrong well see that didn't kind of come across in the video there's a part of the video
where i think you said either you your opinion isn't valid or you can't have an opinion um i
can't remember exactly your opinions don't matter yeah that's right yeah well and that was in regards
to uh your opinions of how uh shitty um l337 is doesn't really matter to the girl who's just like
oh my god i love like this i love this character and it made me feel really good and i like this
movie that's not what you said yeah no i i yeah of course uh i guess in that instance it would just
be about conveying it clearer um i don't think that was the framing at all from what i remember
in the video it was an implication that um isni don't give a shit about your opinions it's your
money that matters oh oh that that statement yeah that's right yeah which sorry i was just
kind of trying to describe the place i'm coming from but yeah no they they don't really care what
your opinions i just don't care about the money wait wait do you honestly believe that
the disney don't care um the disney doesn't care about the opinions only about the money
uh no they yeah that's right i they don't care about it hang on hang on i want to take this one
so they make you know so are you aware that uh of reviewers being paid to create reviews
are you aware that reviewers are paid to go out and watch the movies that disney are very
concerned with getting influences to be pro disney in order to make more money i.e their opinions
matter because of the money yes yeah therefore if being an influencer let's just say pewdiepie
watches the new star wars like tlj and hates it when you think disney will be very concerned that
his opinion would be so low of their film some people's opinions matter right i think i think i
think one of the the things because i'm mostly interested in like video games and um in the
video game industry we often see instances of um public pressure that doesn't necessarily equate
to monetary like monetary you know what influences the decisions of a company are often monetaries
like this is going to be better for sales reputation feed into sales but there are a lot
of instances where like i.e it's a it's a live service game so it's a game that's constantly
getting updated and then the community's like hey this is bad this isn't working for us this uh
there's problems with this and they'll listen to the feedback and then they'll implement those
changes and even in instances where it's like uh like star wars battlefront 2 there was definitely
a monetary factor there that game still sold pretty well though but it was definitely the
backlash and the public you know public pushback against it and saying what they didn't like
was important because if if it's just money then you don't necessarily know what you did wrong
as a company like if star wars the last jedi came out and it didn't do that well at the box
office how would they know what was wrong with that unless they were listening to
public opinion and feedback and solo didn't make money well solo is probably a good example of
that because uh that film didn't make money and it seems like there's been a misinterpret like
solo isn't good but solo is better than uh like the last jedi it's better than last jedi but it
seems like that communication has been lost and it would be lost if it was only looking at the
monetary i think there are just enough instances of um companies listening to people even though
there's definitely a monetary factor behind it but they do they definitely will listen to what
people have to say we just had one yesterday with youtube yeah yeah i guess like the the
opinion of any one individual is probably not that important but the collective opinion i've
got to imagine absolutely i got to imagine that there are people at disney who are well aware of
why people don't like the sequel trilogy i'm guessing your your whole point was to try and
discourage people from being so vocal about hating disney because their opinion is not
going to change anything but we were going with it um uh to the point of attacking people for
liking it well sure but what if what if that wasn't even their goal though what if they just
wanted to express the the damage that has been dealt to a once great franchise um yeah then
right then you wouldn't uh tag certain people in it or you're replying to other people's comments
right it is kind of i guess how you would position your argument that goes both ways right
people who are pro tlj will often tag or quote or screenshot people who are making what they
consider to be poor arguments or poor takes as in i hate this movie because it's terrible they'll be
like yeah okay you don't understand film yeah i mean there there are people who go out on twitter
and say that if you talk about mary sues then you hate women
ah yeah um they would say that we don't understand how to follow up story narrative
because we can't see ourselves in it what do you think about that
mary sues no like the idea that if someone's complaining about mary sues and stuff oh right
that you you have to be a you have to be a sexist because you've complained about mary sues well
like would you say that that person is a woman hater or someone who hates women no but um in
certain circles yeah they'd be labeled as such you wouldn't say that but you wouldn't know is it
is the important thing right like you you wouldn't label them as a sexist for that um oh i probably
it like like i i go pretty hard at men in general um just in a like in a yeah i go
pretty hard in men in a in a in an entertainment piece would you go as far as on women in the same
regard um i should be obvious right i don't know most people wouldn't even start that with an
um most people would say of course i'd treat the genders equally do go ahead though uh well no
it's like it the at again too i'm trying to put it in the context of uh when i made the video
because um you know uh recent comedians like bill burr and uh dave chappelle have talked about it
where um yeah like and again too like like there was this group of women who were calling out
um everybody for a lot of different things and um a lot of causes for their own causes
and uh i was more nervous um about a video that i released that was
king um kylo randon ray's relationship than i was about releasing a video about um how men are
ruining star wars that's disheartening to hear honestly yeah that sucks well like i'm again too
like i know people are like tearing me apart in the chat and everything um
or just uh them i know i know i know i know but uh i just um i'm just like i'm just an open
person and i'm uh actually genuinely willing like i know i present my argument as an argument as
such because like that's just how i was uh trained to do even though i know i use uh
several logical fallacies uh in it but to level with you right no you made a tweet saying that
if someone if a man complains about mary sue's they 100 eight women and don't understand narrative
and look dumb that's pretty literally like the the tweet uh can sometimes be oh yeah there's
plenty of context maybe you are angry maybe referring to a specific set of people maybe
this is maybe it's a fake account you never actually said it who knows it's no it was it
was i said it uh in regards to um all of the tweets i was seeing about uh everyone going off
i think at that time everyone was going off about red complaint about it no because that was
when women complain it's
so like again again she's like i've made videos going over the whole mary sue thing about ray
it's a serious problem with her character she's she's possibly the prime example
so like you know you've you've all been on twitter right when you're going on twitter
and stuff right you're just seeing what you're seeing and so if you're seeing you
and if you're uh following or being followed or being or having people like that are in a
certain group uh that's all the content you're going to see and then we all have to be wary of
well you have the ability to go out and see whatever content you want oh it's not it's not
always so easy to just break it all back hang on so to give you an example right we've ran this
the 53rd episode of efap we've had i believe one female guest and that's not for the lack of our
desire to have female guests just upon reaching out that's that's what we get back in return
does this mean i should put out a tweet saying women don't like discussion uh no but uh like
your guys's discussion um like you know it could be like it's really hurtful sometimes
and uh um yeah and so we'll know but you know and and handle that
it's still i think oh people are saying as well anna's not been on an efap episode she's been on
technically a guest she's been she will be she will be but yeah jay longboat's only
email that's been on a full episode um jay longboat's probably the most controversial person
on efap as a whole she beats out possibly everybody and she uh just if she heard that
women might not want to come on because it can be hurtful with uh probably surprising you get
where i'm getting at though right like you you would admit this this tweet is of poor phrasing
at the very least i'm not trying to like string you up by your tweet i'm just like you you you
would agree right this is a pretty crappy tweet right um yeah it's all just you know it's uh
i i think it's uh i think it's trying not to people will say things on twitter that they don't
that if you if you give them a little bit more time to like mull it over i think many of us here
are of the opinion that twitter is a shithole yes oh we uh we definitely get that all the time i'm
glad i'm i'm kind of glad i'm banned from twitter because it's a terrible place and snarking
every once in a while which is not exactly helping but i usually counter snark and i think one of the
key things uh remember about twitter is it does not represent you know the world oh yeah twitter
is not real life um and because that seems to be where you got your impression that uh
if a guy criticizes mary sue the sexist um which is a that's a pretty you know extreme
time to find yourself in not not entirely not at all oh not at all absolutely not how well
how would you distinguish a man who says uh who is a sexist who says raise a mary sue from someone
who isn't a sexist who says raise a mary sue how would you distinguish them and quantify them to
see which group was larger than the other i i don't know how you could i don't know how you
can tell the difference between a a comment versus in a like uh someone's actual viewpoint or like a
mistake like what about this how many legitimate full-blown sexist you know in real life that just
hate women because they're women could you can you count one in your in your actual real life
you've met them in real life i've come across guys who um probably don't think they hate women
but by the way they talk about them they do um but i don't like i don't like that's not my circle
obviously so and i would assume that's a very small minority amongst all the men you know
of course so if you were to just go off even your own anecdotal experience of men in general
wouldn't that inform you somewhat that uh therefore most men who criticize
ray as being a mary sue would perhaps match the same dispersion of sexist men you meet in your
own real life that that might be a very small minority that actually are that sexist that
most people are criticizing ray are criticizing because for legitimate reasons
basically would you extrapolate the real world into the arguments being made on the internet
like when i listen to your criticism it sounds the same as someone saying i don't like big
hunky action heroes and if a woman says that i assume she hates men um like i would yeah i think
hear them develop it right like at least like if i just said i hate mary sues or something you
go why like because they're all women like whoa that's clearly a female statement but if i said
because they often never have to work for anything and i i prefer my characters earning their victory
that has nothing to do with sex right or gender
well would you say that there are legitimate reasons why people would say that ray is a mary
sue of all the arguments you've heard would you say oh yeah like you can see
why people can get hot about it is because they can see
the points and if you do know about characters and storytelling
d like it's not if you look at the definition of a mary sue you do have to
it does require further explanation sometimes right but you could also argue that luke got his
powers very quickly as well right so i think we don't we i know i know the time they they screw
up everything with the timeline in the last jedi right the the short timeline kind of ruins the
narrative because it doesn't make there's no you could yeah other than other than where the movie
positions the rest of the film you there are a lot there's a lot that you could just leave out of
the star wars narrative and it would have no impact unfortunately doesn't yeah i like
i don't really think it fits in a trilogy do you think that if lee was a mary sue that would mean
she isn't was a mary sue my point being that just because if luke was does that change the
fact that ray is uh no no but i don't think that he is thought of as one and so just in the same
way that you can point to the mary sue archetype as a reason um to say that she is you could point
at a similar character like luke to point how she isn't i imagine that people use it as a shorthand
but trying to bring a several set of criticisms on board quickly to translate the idea because
when someone says it to you i imagine you think like oh so they're powerful slash can solve
problems they're liked by a lot of people they're an author insert these things will probably be
applicable probably not all and probably to varying degrees but that's all it's for and so
that's what i mean by you ask them to develop what they're saying um to figure out if they're
sexist or not i honestly in my time on the internet i really don't know many people who
hate women because women are just half the population they're just everywhere you know
it's just i i don't know when you hate women but like nothing like like like in the same way that
there's this hatred for a lot of different groups in a in a meme format but like genuinely convincing
me that someone hates a woman and they can't enjoy star wars for it is confusing to me i don't
know what they are enjoying in star wars in the first place considering leah was a thing
just on a side note i just want to add in luke isn't a mary sue or gary stu
at all um and i think that can be argued very strongly uh to establish that that would take
us down a different server all four of us here would disagree with you vehemently that luke is
a mary sue uh yeah i don't think he is either right i'm i'm but i'm using a similar character
that uh he does have a similar archetype obviously like he he does have the hero's journey and
they um attempted his journey uh does she's the protagonist but i don't think she has a hero's
journey i mean you said it i was i'm curious if that just slipped out or if you really well i
actually i actually he has much of a here i kind of think um kylo ren more has the hero's journey
it's interesting you said that right because a lot of people seems to me on kylo ren's side
when it comes to like who they want to be the protagonist in this series and it's like that's
really interesting isn't it yeah i would say if i like really had to like pick one of them it
probably like it kind of almost started off as finn but the main character of the story like
shifted halfway through uh right uh the narrative again the story do you um yeah go ahead i was just
going to say do you think it makes you a better person to enjoy media rather than being pissed
off by it let's say um okay so like as like if we take the extremes like if someone just likes
everything they watch are they better than someone who is a critical eye me and you watch a film um
i come away going that was shit i fucking hated that you were like oh i enjoyed it are you the
better person oh no if you like but every move um are you finding another one of my tweets to
tear me apart against you said this at the end of the video yeah you said let's all be better
people and just enjoy it again too and and uh i haven't watched that video um but again i i just
watched yeah i know a year ago yeah it's old it's all i mean i don't like i get it and i watch parts
i watch i watch parts of your of the stuff that you had said but you know you could only handle
so much of uh boy talk it can be rough i i get it and again i think um it shows good quality
are you willing to talk about it absolutely um yeah all i was gonna say is it's like i expect
you to say that you don't actually believe that statement i do not know what possessed you to say
that in your video because again again it was all coming from the place of um
attacking people online for liking star wars and like and i i i know that uh it may not have uh
got across enough um but uh that was really the place i was coming for because that's what i
was inundated by when yeah when you say attacking like because i know there was a big you know uh
twitter store and everything of people criticizing the last jedi and uh saying it's crap and everything
like that i don't you know translate that as personal attacks it's just people voicing how
much they disliked it and even if they are particularly yeah it's like you know ray is
a this and that or a rose is a this and that and stuff and that's just an outlet to express how
deeply they disliked the these the depiction of these characters in the movies that's very
different to being overtly sexist or attacking people and things but it seems like so many people
interpret that as people are attacking and they're bullying and stuff and it's like
they're sharing an honest opinion i would agree with you on in that framework but again my
experience with that framework was um i like childish gambino uh donald glover um and if i
was to say uh share a picture of the uh child the lando calrissian funko pop that i got um no
but right if right if if just carry on carry on your flight well no but like so i just like
something i i like the musician i love his music uh in the background of the agency i have like uh
his vinyl uh at the uh at the back it's behind me um i just it's just stuff on display that i like
um and i and i and i got you know made fun of for it a bunch um and so these people are
going on twitter saying something they like and uh then the replies in it or the comments are
like oh you're a dumb whore for liking that and so it is but it is like that i don't get i know
like i don't i didn't experience that type of talk about star wars but when i would watch
uh colleagues of mine who were women uh talk about star wars that was the replies they get
and uh yeah and it kind of exposed me to this like this way they're treated to so to try and
maybe try and provide like a scenario here like i've got a tie wind figurine um my parents picked
it up because they like game of thrones too and they were like oh you like tie wind there you go
like i don't collect these things but i was just like yeah yeah cool thank you appreciate the gift
over and i put it on twitter because like hey tie wood figurine if i had someone say man that
is awesome and it's cool that you you got a gift of something that you actually like have a sort
of investment in and um you know it's a nice nice kept figuring well made it's like that's that's
great cool stuff and then i get another one that says um i'm really disappointed that you would buy
plastic tat that means fucking nothing when it's just the show is what's meaningful that the message
the idea is why are you buying this crap when all it's going to do is encourage the industry
and and just take space that you're not even going to use like oh is it really so you can
just look over there and go oh that's nice is it on me to be like well the first comment was from
a better person like just genuine question do you think that the second person was kind of being a
bad person or do you think that they were just expressing their perspective that they probably
have a lot of reasons to be informed by maybe they could have an argument with you what i'm
trying to imply here is just the negativity but but so but what you're doing though is taking like
a nicer situation and applying it to like well i'm giving the person reason right as opposed to
saying you're a dumb whore but like yeah because the three of us before all of us we we get shit
all the time on the internet for not liking it like people tell us all the time that we hate women
we hate minorities we hate this we hate that we're terrible people we get told that we're
like garbage people just because we don't like it and we just laugh at that shit because it's
hilarious like if you're if you're you take any position on the internet then people are just
gonna hate you for it that goes for basically everything yeah so the idea that this is exclusive
to women or that women supposedly get it way rougher is just no this is stuff we all have to
deal with that's just the internet oh and right and i essentially was doing the same thing
making this video right like i was creating an inflammatory comment for for interest draw and
but for reference right so like if me and rags post a picture each of a figuring we
have and someone responds dumb whore we laugh at it because there's nothing there there's no
through like how could we be unintelligent and like pouring ourselves outward it's like there's
so little connection to that and so in the same way your video like we watch it we'd laugh at a
lot of the stables because we don't know how you got there um and so in a way you're becoming the
very people you support to destroy yeah i would there's yeah there would be a bit of that in there
for sure yeah see that uh have you sorry i'm interested oh sorry i was just gonna say quickly
have you many women who hate tlj um i haven't really thought about that um i don't know uh i guess
i don't know i don't think so i certainly know of more like in my direct sphere i know more
girls who dislike star wars generally because it doesn't appeal to them and therefore they would
like sorry dislike uh last jedi probably equally as much or probably more if they even bothered to
watch it um than men so i'm assuming there's that would be somewhat paralleled by you that you know
women that just don't like star wars in general um well you know i i think when the force awakens
came out i at least for me um noticed uh more women talking about star wars that was the one
thing i had noticed but i think it could it probably more equates to just a younger generation
um than women in general right like i don't think it was necessarily a woman movement i think it's
just young people uh yeah i don't know i don't really think about it i like it's funny to make
a video like that i don't really try to like think about it always in like that type of context i
guess well i mean i i would encourage you to always try and follow the logic through of any
statement just to make sure you're being consistent and perhaps not you're gonna make sweeping
statements about med like you might want to take it easy or right sure but yeah but you know again
too the same could be said about uh individuals that you see on youtube the same could be
you take it easy on right like you right like you guys went pretty hard uh at me and and it's
all in fun and entertainment essentially yeah on on an individual based on things that they
said specifically not on a group extrapolated from data that we made our judgments of your
statements specifically we didn't say because of your statements men suck yeah i mean i i
personally you know always take issue and resent comments saying that because i dislike star wars
i hate women i'm like what like how does he not be grossly offended by such a statement you know
it's uh people are not going to be very receptive to judgments of their character based on what
immutable characteristics that i'm like yeah yeah it's um it's uh it's uh it's not it's not
particularly nice um and because if we're talking about i guess it's like throwing stones
like you threw the first stone with the title of your video i know 100% yeah and uh my main
issue is with the statement because like i've said multiple times i don't know you personally
and honestly just from my interaction now you seem like a very pleasant chap i'm sure we could
have had fun playing dnd and all that and because i have heaps of friends that i disagree with heaps
and stuff and so my my kind of you know issue are with your certain opinions you've shared
statements you've made and things of course uh yeah yeah i yeah i was saying and very inflammatory
um aggressive accusatory uh and one-sided arguments some that you would say are incorrect
from your perspective now um some yeah like well like yeah like it's like obviously like obviously
like the um to make a statement and i used logical fallacies to try to prove a point
oh well good on you for admitting that at least yeah yeah like we all use logical fallacies it's
yeah i mean when you say something wrong you say well i goofed up that was wrong i was stupid i'm
glad i know better now and it shows good quality of character if you can just say yeah i was really
wrong but the main thing i guess was uh because of the main the main issue that was with the video
was more of like the broad sweeping statements i guess about like it's um it's just it's it
doesn't feel nice um to have a have a perspective on a film and then sort of and then have it
inferred i guess to like a person's judgment of of character and like important things like
important things like whether or not they're prejudiced or anything like that it's just kind
of like a it's um the thing is is again i think it's just like there probably are like a handful
of people who may well fall into the category of just taking umbridge with the film based on the
gender and the race of characters in it but there's such a small portion of the of the population
that i'm not even sure it would be worthwhile like to cover that if you find one point that
out to me because i've never met anyone who unironically actually holds that position and
the thing is like even even if they did right even if they did um it doesn't necessarily have
anything to do with whether or not their criticisms of the film were valid or not like the intention
shouldn't be as important i think i think that was the main pitfall of the video was you're a bit
too caught up on intent rather than um i guess what what they were saying or what they were trying
to get across or their issues with the film yeah someone could legit hate women but they could
still have valid points about the they just wouldn't have valid points about their perspective
um no i i i i oh sorry go no it's all good i i hear what uh i hear kind of i hear what you're
coming from and i hear what you're saying um my experience with the last jedi was a weird one too
in the sense like when i was watching it uh i had thought i'm like oh do i do i not like star wars
anymore that's like why did i think why did that thought pop up in my head washing it and i was
kind of like oh and everyone around me was like oh that was sweet you know like everyone's jacked up
on opening night adrenaline um and uh yeah and and and then i had to watch it again and i had to
watch the documentary and i had to watch the commentary before i actually really liked the
movie um and that's never a good sign of a movie yeah just just after like watching those things
made me even more like blown away by all of the lost potential yeah well like i just fell in love
with the set pieces and um i it was when actually when the when the film first came out too i have
like i talk about it when it first came out and how pissed off i was about how literally all the
plots uh device like all the plot devices from the previous story were literally thrown out um
oh that was kind of a slap in your face because star wars is so much about the plot devices
and um yeah i it uh it took me a while before i could enjoy it and then but i yeah i do kind of
enjoy it now i don't you know but it's like i don't totally hate jar jar anymore either so
would you like to speak to a woman who hates the um well it like why wouldn't i want to talk
i'm just like chat a raving about how that star wars girl is in in the chat and i guess they want
to have you to meet i don't i don't think they'll get what they're looking for but the idea is that
i think there's an assumption that people who are ripping into the film are the people that you look
at as being almost unreasonable and that the women you speak to are all very positive about
the film and therefore you conclude that men ruining star wars and women are keeping it going
and what chat one i think is to have anna come in and yeah and her destroy my arguments but i'm
yeah i'm super on the same page so i mean yeah like i'm not trying to be condescending whatever
we were aware that some women do not like that film for very extended and explained reasons
that all relate to star wars specifically ie i would never want it i would never want it to
be construed that i like that i would think other you know what i mean like it it's i know that i
am saying men are ruining star wars in the video but i don't like outside of that which i know is
a huge brush to paint with um i'm not i don't think that like all women love like like everyone's
everyone's a unique individual i know i'm i understand what i was doing with my title
yeah i think i think i think the gender-oriented lens of the of the title in the video itself was
what threw you off really um yeah that was but that was the goal there's also a couple of other
things i was wanting to ask you about um if you guys are fine for me jumping to a different
subject of the video well i was going to say real quick then was the um the the the idea that men
are ruining star wars her argument to you would be that tlj is ruined star wars and would you
think that that's an almost an impossibility or i think that could be valid
i think oversaturation ruined star wars like i think they they totally missed the point that
what we loved most about star wars was anticipating the next one and talking about the lore and
breaking it all down not for me no i don't know about that she would probably argue you don't think
that you don't think that adds added to the hysteria and excitement of not if it's good
give me as much of it as you can yeah i would even see you gets away with it yeah that's true
and yeah i think she would argue like the damage to the characters the lore even just the plot
within the film and the the lack of coherency is what damages itself and its franchise that
it's a part of you think that you could be convinced by that or do you think that that's
a bit hyperbolic um well it just stands out that movie stands out so separate from a lot of other
star wars films that yeah you could that's for certain you could you could obviously um yeah
see that for sure but i could see why people love it like you know what i mean like i think that
difference is why a lot of people do love it the way they love it so well this kind of goes into
one of my questions and i'm not sure you still want to get uh star wars go on more um well i
don't want to like waste of time or anything i don't want to have it brought up just to have
dale here be like that's fair like if she says like you know uh so i was just gonna say you could
go ahead with uh what you've got to put to move on oh well this should be a brief one i would hope
is your comments about space wizards that was just kind of a flippant remark that wasn't really
serious i hope it's actually uh i think it's a it's a reference to um like uh i can't like
i don't know what the reference is to anymore right but it's become a meme in my mind that it
you know just making fun of like it's about space wizards what do you think that means
that star wars is about space wizards sure what does it imply does it imply that it's not to be
taken that um that it uh that uh well it's it's kind of it's almost an entendre in the sense of
that it's um uh it it's it's dry from fantasy elements you know like they are like knights and
it's you know medieval or samurais in space um it's so it's part that and then part that
is serious like i love star wars a lot and i've loved it for a really long time and um
you know but it you know at the same time like well the context in which you use in the video
is that because it has space wizards in it there's no point in taking it seriously or having
valid criticism against it because what was implied by that is that well it's silly from
the get-go so why even bother trying to argue about it well yeah like i think you know when
she especially talked about like some of the plot holes um that they made a whole entire movie to
explain the plot hole of the death star um you know like a plot hole the convenience the best
okay right but yeah but you know it was commonly joked as as a plot hole yeah i've ordered a plot
hole in the past um but so yeah sorry what what's your point here um is that uh yeah i don't know
i've lost my point yeah i i guess because like that's why i was hoping it was just a flippant
kind of statement because just because something has you know a fantastical element as we were
saying in our kind of um criticism and review of your video doesn't undermine any serious validity
it might hold or serious themes or the fact that older people can't enjoy it or anything like i
i hate that statement when people try and use that as a means to dismiss an argument because yeah it
means nothing of course like i had an entire youtube channel two years of my life dedicated
to just talking about star wars marvel pixar like i obviously uh feel the same way feel very
passionate about star wars i was you know known as uh the star wars guy and um i read the comics
and i read the book lots of the books obviously who could read all of the books um yeah like i'm
i'm deep into star wars and it's super important to me you know um taking my kids to see star wars
so i can create little clones of myself is like one of my favorite things to do it sounds like
it sounds like that type of statement then would offend even someone like you
why do you love it it's just about space wizards right yeah like you know if you know sometimes
uh being subversive and uh how is that being subversive it's like i have a sarcastic nature
um so and i tend to poke fun at myself a bit too which is why i probably seem like such a beta
um but really at the end of the day i'm just uh i don't know i just don't i'm trying not to take
myself so seriously because i took myself i wouldn't have been able to come on come on here
and uh talk to you guys and that's really cool of you and i do like again i think that's great
um yeah because that statement just seems to attack yourself and uh yeah yeah i mean i think
it's kind of like i'm i'm like i'm in on the joke i guess essentially like i'm in on
because the only way that we ever see the movie just a movie about space wizards is a way to
devalue any kind of criticism of it and like what takes away from criticism made for it
the idea that oh you found it kind of with it yeah so but it's just a space wizard
movie meant for children or whatever so we yeah and i criticism that's the only yeah we ever see
it framed there's a lot of things that are happening out there that are upsetting a lot
of people uh right with how whatever their take is and um we all have a crazy platform to
to share our opinions and so now we're all um getting upset about everybody's takes and opinions
well i'm just disagreeing i mean i'm not not really especially somewhat because i think it's
honestly a disingenuous way to try and address someone's opinion or criticism and stuff and
just struck me as odd because it's the same thing that would be applied to you and i don't think you
would appreciate someone trying to dismiss your views or passion or love for star wars because
it has space wizards in it when in actual fact space wizards are awesome but yeah we all want
to be a space wizard um i know and again too i i was i i grew up during the prequels right so i
had a i had to deal with it in real life uh with like 40 year old dudes well i'm sorry what what
is the context of that you actually had to debate as a child against 40 year old dudes about whether
or not the prequels were any yeah like you're at a comic book store or you're at like you know
you're building computers like you know like you're hanging out with people all the time and
uh yeah they you know you you come back from attack of the clones or whatever you're all
stoked on it and they're like them who's terrible you're an idiot like
bulba fett's the greatest and jango fett's an idiot or whatever you know and you're like you
just enjoyed your experience and you're just um you know trying now trying to defend yourself i
remember having i guess uh maybe maybe that might be the influence for like the uh the i guess the
perception of the way that criticism is directed because for us it's not about like uh it's it's
more like it's trying to be more focused on the the content itself rather than i guess making
character judgments and like whether or not that like because because the whole the whole
camp of the the efap thing is like trying to determine objective quality for like films
stories and stuff and and the idea being that um removal biases objective qualities uh yeah
separate from like personal so i.e venom is bad like it's a bad movie but i like it
and i'm aware that it's bad but i still like it um whereas if somebody were to i think a good
example would be john wick too i love john wick too and then maul is like talking about how it's
no good and then that starts to and that starts to like yeah and so and so then that influences
me into like liking john wick too less i still like it but it's not like that's maul's fault
like i decided to dislike the movie more because it became a problem for me um and so so when it
comes to discussing the film the goal is not to change the way that people feel about it because
what people feel is up to them and it's not like you know it's not up for anybody to decide how you
feel about a film but if it if it results in the opinion of the film decreasing then that that's
just what happened you know it's different to the example you had where it seemed like people were
just being downright mean-spirited yeah like and and you know and so i i took that lens and saw
what was happening to other people who were close to me right and um and uh you know in a vacuum
yeah like it's probably just uh an instance of um i guess uh i you know but like it's just it's
for me uh i always handled videos as like exploratory right um i was making a video
i realized i thought something different by the end and then i would edit this video and be like
i don't agree with any of this anymore you know like or or or what have you or you have a guest
on and they totally change your opinion about something or you listen to you know skeptic's
guide to the universe and you're like oh jeez uh organic food's been bullshit the whole time
like you know like stuff like that so you know i'm just trying to i just uh i'm always trying
to explore and uh grow from other people's experiences and uh at that time i was growing
through making videos um and uh my opinion and and uh at that time when i made that video that
was an opinion i had and um i i don't uh i don't think i would uh go no i wouldn't um i don't
agree with everything i was watching and uh yeah it was you know part of why i came in came
what would you disagree with in particular um
good uh i think that i could still i think i could still achieve what i was trying to do like
like so creatively i still could have um i like i i still could be inflammatory and i could still
say everything that i wanted to say um i'm interested on what that would be now like what's
your current views do you still feel men are trying to ruin star wars and that if we criticize
the movie we're trying to rob people from enjoying it and uh those kind of things no once i stepped
away um which was about a year ago it was around that time um a i you know after muting and and
removing people and stuff you kind of uh get out of it and i don't want to say that this doesn't mean
that experience still didn't happen to them and like a lot of people have been made to feel very
shitty about their enjoyment for star wars um and i do think that's really important for us to put
in context like there are always going to be yes there's always going to be examples of goodness
and badness but there are people out there who have experienced a lot of badness at times
and it has surrounded about just their enjoyment over star wars um uh but did all this uh did all
this spawn for me just asking what you disagreed with that we said i'm curious what we like what
we yeah what what what we said in our our response that you would disagree with what you
said that you'd still you know hold firm to or do you think we made any no criticism in terms of
you know something that you think is just just wrong because we i'd like to hear that
like the general principle like the whole basis of the argument is completely wrong right like
what is the basis of the argument aren't ruining star wars oh you mean the basis of your video
is uh like the the men are the men are ruining star wars one is wrong oh so all right okay right
so we were incorrect by oh i'm not saying that you're incorrect no no he's talking about his
video rights but is there anything that you did disagree with that we made that you think is an
illegitimate point or one that you would refute is there anything would be interesting interesting
to dive into that wouldn't yeah like again i didn't watch everything you said uh just because
again a lot of it was personal attacks on me um but i would say the personal attacks were
minority i know it can seem like that because well i wasn't that many we were we were firing
back not you know we weren't the first to shoot across the bow either oh i wasn't having like a
one-on-one conversation with you right like it's not that you don't have to yeah broad
generalizations normally are man well so if you say the a generalization against men you hit him
yeah ain't gotta be a one v one i'm not sure we could get into the minutia because i know
there's an argument you had a bit if star wars is making a statement about racism and i know
the original trilogues i i don't feel that's the case but um yeah are you gonna say something rags
what was it like anything in the video you disagreed with that we made that was point wise
it i honestly i don't i don't know the video well enough anymore to
to answer that one for you fair enough i'd like i again like the i think you can take the the w
on the entire concept of the video was is not right well right like like the the men ruining
star wars like that's obviously not true um you know you don't feel weird about that like the
idea that you make a statement purely to get people to listen to you and it's um it wasn't
it's not it again it was uh it's hard having a debate with four people um
um and it was i i know i again for me too like there is i know a lot of people like it like i
don't know you probably like the video looks like you know trash or whatever right but uh there was
like a like there's an artistic side to myself that uh you're trying to express um you know
though a lot of the times you know when you're doing these types of things you have your opinions
um but you know they can be they're like amped up which you say that opinions could be wrong
of course opinions are usually wrong all right we because well i don't know i've
usually wrong really usually facts are right opinions are always always what always
objective being wrong right like an opinion can always be subject to being wrong yeah they're
subject to being wrong you said they're usually wrong that's interesting i never heard that
do do explore i'm interested in that um yeah i don't know i think opinions kind of can change
with the wind a bit uh sure they can but you said they're usually wrong so like most opinions out
there are incorrect maybe it's just something that you misspoke i'm not sure i think it
gets interesting you qualified it though dale you said you you changed that to saying opinions
can be subject to being wrong which i think we all agree with yeah oh yeah oh yeah absolutely
but yeah i just i now yeah you're just you know deconstructing my
like yeah you're just holding me to the things i'm saying i understand what you're doing
um so you know i guess i'm curious you said some curious that's all but yeah like
again it comes from the place again it comes from the place like i know
it's your backup or like oh seriously you're saying all my opinions are wrong
it's more of it's more of me projecting uh society right where i'm taking my experiences
where i'm open to all my opinions kind of being wrong um and uh and then kind of projecting that
as like a almost like a a catch-all for myself to be like you know my opinion
anyway i respect that you're you know willing to admit that some of the things you said were
grossly inaccurate and stuff and uh and good on you for for doing so mate i am um yeah most people
don't uh most people don't show up yeah well i just um i thought you guys were uh being pretty funny
and uh yeah i was just watching clue um with uh uh with the family and uh it was kind of wrapping
up and i just i saw on twitter that um you guys were talking about it and i i'd know nothing about
the show and uh i thought i'd just come on and chat about it but um well let's go what do you um
out of curiosity what do you think episode nine will be about or do you have any sort of
any observations that you might make or what what's your i guess what's your attitude or what's your
opinion on the upcoming episode nine think it'll be good bad could can't even hazard a guess um
well i like force awakens uh with jj abram's directing it because i kind of feel like
it has a lot of those quote unquote star wars moments in it so it's a bit of again a catch-all
kind of film but i also enjoyed the way it was shot um so i'm excited to see star wars go more
back to the style of uh the force awakens um and uh yeah you know they're probably gonna lean pretty
heavy on kylo and ray uh unfortunately that means characters like fin are gonna take a back seat
again um and hopefully they have a better storyline for him and uh yeah i don't know
there's gonna be super jedi that's you know because i you know i think that there she's
gonna be able to channel the dark side and uh do both like how luke was able to do the force choke
and i will have a bit of like a super jedi battle hopefully hey guys i'm gonna have to get going um
unfortunately my time is running out that's okay man you've been up for uh nearly seven hours
oh boy it's been a lot of fun though and i can't wait to do it again all right uh well do you want
to quickly give your channel good old plugaroo well if any of you guys watching like swords and
how they are adapted into pop culture and also how they use historically not just swords just
really how medieval history is adapted into pop culture and other things and how it was
really like and all that stuff as well as uh you know fantasy discussions and science
fiction and things yeah go go over and check out shadow versity or you could even check out my novel
shadow of the conchro it's available wrote a novel i did i'm just gonna share that again
and um it's available print ebook uh and also audiobook narrated by michael kramer and kate
redding they awesome indeed uh always wonderful to have you yeah he's quite good thanks for
coming on again and we'll have to have you back for that opinions video yeah oh
cool all right thanks fellas i'll see you around yeah nice meeting you yeah
but yeah uh dale is there anything else you'd like to uh talk about we are open books
uh i think well it seems like uh the chat annoyed that you guys were being so soft on me
um but that was uh you know you guys uh held me to the coals and i um and i you know you probably
could have been harsher but uh no it was a good conversation well i mean you're here that's that's
like the important thing about it for weeks you've achieved more than the majority of people we have
a criticize well i i i'm nothing but a people pleaser i guess no um obviously not uh yeah no
it's true yeah it's uh i i do i feel bad uh if i like i feel bad if i made any um
um i knew i was going to make some men feel bad about that um and i what just then
because we're unsingling them out oh i oh we would have a all right oh sure
yeah i was gonna say we've got we've got super chats to read they're all
very contact specific so i'm happy to let you uh well escape if you know of course oh that's
that's great yeah i'm i'm done thanks for having me on and uh yeah i i hope um
i hope uh i hope uh i hope uh anyone uh feelings too badly and um yeah thanks um oh you'll have
to try more harder than that for us it's all good thanks for coming on i appreciate it thank you
i catch it to loot and there were three and there were three um all right so that brief
interlude we could now carry on with a super jazz it's like brief interlude i think it was i think
it was like an hour yeah this is what i mean it's like a like specific sections of this podcast
sometimes longer than like just regular podcast i know it's like we're quickly gonna do x and it's
like uh the size of one and a half normal podcast like oh okay um but yeah this is we're coming up
to seven hours this is another one of them chunky you never know what's gonna happen efaps um it
seems like that's gonna become the norm zoom it just seems to like it grows on its own it goes
in many directions terrifying in its own way um but you know chat judging from chat's reactions
to all of that i think they were frustrated that he he wasn't more um he's very non-committal
very dodgy very dodgy wouldn't answer questions very precisely or clearly very skittery on his
um i think i think he was thinking about it more i think i think so too it was sort of like
mulling over it and i guess trying to figure out where exactly he falls on the most particular
things because the video is a year and a half old but at the same time is there's probably
some things in there that you'd still like agree with and i guess it's like trying to mull over
and figure out yeah like i actually think he is so disconnected from the video that he made that
it's almost like one of us having to defend that video as if we had made it you know i mean like
i don't think he actually agrees with most of what he said in that video i don't think many people
would and that he was probably just it came from a place of a lot of negative influence from what
he would perceive as essentially just men because like it sounded a lot of his responses sounded
like the kind of things we might end up being like we just be like i don't that's not like that's
just the right position i could defend because most people that was why it was um all those
questions were coming up right uh it was but yeah you know he came on and um he was he was civil
and i want i want us to be appreciative of that rather than well i mean you should be i mean like
like joseph anderson won't come on because you called him a massive once it's like and now you
can't talk to him about stuff what they've noticed is that when we seem to bring people on
they really like won't stand up for their video they're really a lot of people think that the
angle of it being quote unquote three to five on one is is to do with this and i know for a fact
that if me and rags was sent into a lion's den of five people saying that tlj was amazing
wouldn't catch us folding yeah man it's like that's the thing is like i'd still have
i'd have ideas to defend i would have information that i could put out like i like i wouldn't just
be let go you know now that now i'm being asked about it now that they're asking me really
actually rather simple questions i'm just gonna not say anything or avoid the question or not
present my surely you had like a statement to make and you're gonna make that statement until
it's proved wrong you know as i wish people were more um this is what i believe here is why i
believe it and i think the uh if you compare these two scenarios right like five people love tlj and
you simply do not like it you don't really have any strong positions you just don't like it you
have all of them being like but it's so good it's so awesome here's a thing that's awesome here's
the thing and you just sit there being like okay yeah fine fine like cool but like a lot of our
references are literal like cognitive dissonance for ourselves we're like this doesn't make sense
and so we present it to them what can they do other than go it doesn't matter the themes but
yeah it doesn't matter because dutto or because this other thing is oh it's not about making sense
or it's about space wizards and yeah the thing is um i think when you commit you're exposing
yourself to direct criticism like when you commit to points ambiguity well it's it's exactly right
it's like if you're talking about a video game and you say you know like this this mechanic doesn't
work well and then someone says um that mechanic's not in the game or like oh that you you've got
something wrong there it's like cool you've now exposed yourself to criticism that's just valid
it's not arguable it's not iffy it's not an opinion it's valid and that makes you look bad
sort of so it's like you kind of you when you commit to a position you're just exposing yourself
to real criticism like really just an undebatable criticism it's the idea of a hot take by the way
that kind of bothers me it's like the idea that you've guessed a position and you're hoping it's
going to be the one that turns out to be right that's almost what people seem to look at as hot
takes it's like because yeah yeah because like when they have them in videos they're like this
is my hot take and it's the game of thrones is really bad because of uh the fact that it
can send poor messages about communism or some stupid thing like that like that's my hot take
and then years from now we all agree it's like actually yeah there's loads of information support
so there's a analysis like that hot take was on point even though it was more constructed from
just how they felt about it or something i'm just like why have hot takes in the first place i mean
there were some interesting things that were almost instantly backed down for the whole um
opinions are usually wrong i'm like whoa that's interesting i haven't heard that before i would
you heard how he nearly got there right he was like well facts are always right opinions
it was like are always wrong i think it's um i think because i can see i can see where you go
there like okay facts are normally right so if your opinion is the same as the fact then i suppose
that just by proxy it's correct like if you say i think the sun is a star it's like yeah all right
like most times people's opinions about things are wrong like that is an interesting kind i've
i i that that is interesting isn't it yeah like how tell me how you arrived at that part of the
reason why we couldn't pursue that is because we'd have to go through with him exactly what
he means by opinion because opinion changes for every fucking person's perspective of the actual
definition right yeah yeah of course because like uh he might have been the kind of person that says
opinion is almost synonymous with feeling and a feeling i that was interesting the idea that like
your feeling can change and therefore it would then be decided that the previous one is now wrong
i don't know if that would really take it or not that's the only we had time to go through all of
that no um and yeah i was gonna say the the other variable i think is worth considering is that
some people are not saying it applies to him or that it doesn't apply to me and rags or fringy
but uh there's confidence levels in in what you could call public speaking as well as debate
um yep you can have someone who's excellent at writing an argument in a script and then in
person they're like i mean i would i think i was gonna ask him at one point but i forgot if he had
scripted that video um i don't i don't think it was scripted i yeah i just got that impression
because i think if you but this is the thing i was about to say if it was scripted it would
have had a better structure but i mean there are videos that are scripted but have absolutely
horrendous structure still some people just write stuff and then say that's my script and then they
speak it up hold on um i just saw somebody say fringy care to comment on how you and mauler
screwed up the size of the galaxy with captain marble i did not screw that up mauler screwed
that up he got it wrong it wasn't me wow that's amazing yes you really don't remember me and you
looking into it yes no we did but you you misquoted like we did look into it but then
we agreed on the 500 and you're still not off the hook because you watched the video 500 no
hold on be specific what are you talking about in this instance yeah no what which part remind me
like what so i said there were 500 planets in the galaxy 500 suns all right no but but i obviously
didn't agree with that i must have missed it we did we found like a website or something how
did how did my comments actually found it they found the website that we got the and they said
that like what we'd looked at was um oh but by the way guys i was i was i was i was joking with
the throwing him under the bus it was a joke yeah i was like the the thing with that one i
find fascinating is that um i had someone on twitter say that um if you get that wrong
like why would i watch any of your videos and i was like well i don't know it was a mistake
and they were like yeah but if you get basic things like that wrong why would i ever watch
any of your videos i was like i mean like what you want me to say
um yeah i don't know how unfortunately yeah it went through rags uj and uh for tier
rak shut the fuck up we're trying to speak wait yeah no now now i've got it right because i think
somebody i think people were criticizing i'm mixing it up with two things because there
were two criticisms one was the the planet's one or the the star system's one the other one was
the size of the solar system where it seemed like no there people didn't understand yeah
people don't understand that there's two there's many ways you can define what makes the solar
system but we went with everything that the sun has influence on yeah which is the odd cloud that's
the law that's the law of universal gravitation really fair most people are like it's all the
planets and stuff in it but the point is that even with both of your fuck up um doesn't that
actually make the point of the film worse that's the whole problem with this they're like even worse
people said you were wrong which makes the movie even worse because of it like you accidentally
you accidentally gave the film more credit than it deserved yeah it was bad right it's bad if it's
500 suns but if it's more like if it's significantly more to a degree well it is significantly more
it's a hundred billion so like that's what it is so like the idea that like i was trying to explain
that to travel through one galaxy which by the way yeah people either do or do not consider the
odd cloud and they said we were wrong for considering it which is not true it's not defined
as wrong to consider that in the entire solar system like the milky way is a hundred thousand
light years and the issue is that whether where you define the boundary is it doesn't matter
because the nearest star is 4.2 light years away so regardless of that she's still going to take
4.2 years to get to the nearest star yeah it's absolutely insane and people are like we go there
it's like yes it's still but isn't that funny that there's a fact that's wrong in the video
it's almost like there is such a thing as objective standards yeah my opinion on how many
stars there are in the galaxy was fucking wrong and it happened because i either misread a quote
or i got a quote that meant something that i didn't think it meant but yes no there are a
hundred billion stars in the in the milky way and i'm sorry i didn't catch that i go through
a lot of proofreading processes and i'm surprised we didn't catch that yeah like this i'm surprised
we didn't catch that like six of my friends watched it i watched it and i watched it a
couple of times obviously because the editing process and for some reason it slipped to me
until and i i found it myself when i was watching on the day i released i was like 500 suns
that can't be right well maybe next time you make a video near the grass tyson and give it
a little once over and let you know about all your celestial flaws
fun fun regardless um but that's one of the ones that people always try and
reference for how i don't do my research i'm always like jesus christ like i can make one
mistake we did a lot of we we did a lot of research for that video um for those of you
who don't know i i was in several calls with mauler while he was working on that video
that's why you've got a credit at the end of the video it just kept getting worse and worse
and worse every single time we started you call it's like hey so this thing in the movie
what the fuck oh that movie so bad yeah that's why by the way rags because you did mention like
dr strange is probably objectively the worst like do you really think it's objectively
worse than captain marvel yeah because i i would say that captain marvel marvel marvel
i would still say that captain captain marvel still like sort of makes sense but no it doesn't
if you try to i'd say it's it's less nonsensical than dr stranger because dr strange is flat out
boom just random magic but the time stone fight isn't a problem it depends on what the system is
but captain marvel conversely is boom space powers you know you can still transpose that
argument well just just think about the scene where she gets blasted off the ship she's falling
to the ground and she's like i'm gonna fly now how do you even know that that's something you
could do like you're saying you're saying the same thing about magic and all the weird
really because they have books about it the time machine like the the powers working
inconsistently here and there like in the final fight when kaecilius and his goons are
being selectively moved back in time yeah that's that's bad that's bad that's one element but
you know that that comes after learning that they have a whole series of people who have been
training to use this they have tools in this regard they have books upon books about all of
it like that's a way better system than captain marvel just being like i was hit by goo now i can
do all these things like okay and well she is a pilot so when she got hit by the goo she became
the plane in her mind i guess i guess the logic would be that it was a light space it was like a
light speed engine um so it can go but even the light speed engine it's like going at light speed
because because i think one of the the really pedantic point we got on with the uh with her
flying at light speed next to the ship it's like if you if your trajectory is off by like
one centimeter you're going to end up the other side of the galaxy and how do they fight each
other again next time we watch dr strange we'll i would like to go through and look at the way that
powers and magic and all that stuff works because i remember when we watched it we were we were all
just like man well even still the protagonist is intact the plot is intact yeah i i definitely like
dr strange way more than captain marvel like let it no mistake being made the character itself
yeah even the character i i think i want more dr strange yeah i don't want to see dan craver
whatever name is ever again carol danvers is her name i don't ever want to see carol danvers ever
again but i do and i'm legit excited for the next dr strange do you still maintain that it's
objectively of poor writing quality than captain marvel poor writing quality oh i don't know i mean
remember there's there's other bad ones too like black panther yeah we don't need to reference
like this captain marvel has to be the worst right for me like oh yeah maybe it's the worst
maybe i don't know they're both terrible so i think we need to watch him back again i want to see him
again but you like i made a two-hour video of all the problems dr strange i know you haven't made
a two-hour video about dr strange because i wouldn't be able to there's not that many problems
there's a lot of problems there's not that many problems well i mean literally because remember
when we were watching dr strange and we got up to because i i distinctly remember like because you
hadn't seen it yet rags and we were watching it for like for the first 30 40 minutes we happy i
was that there i'm like oh yeah this this is go well and then like it just started falling apart
yeah yeah exactly captain marvel never fell apart because it was never structured to begin with
it fell apart we all turned on it and then we were all like oh i like dr strange but man this movie's
a mess oh the movie never had a good scene i'm not i'm not saying captain marvel's better
what do you mean you said it's objectively the worst i hate i i hate no i like dr strange
and i would much rather see dr strange than captain marvel but based on my memory based
on my memory especially us watching it i just feel like we had so much to talk about with dr
strange and it was so out there that we were like man this is the worst thing fucking ever there's
more to talk about with captain marvel it's everything what we have to do is we're going
to have to watch the both of these movies again back to back i'll watch dr strange again i don't
need to watch the captain marvel again i got a whole fucking video about everything we will have
to watch dr strange has to have more wrong in every scene in order to be worse than captain
marvel how is we have to be thorough it's this is what the people want the thing is is um with
captain marvel every scene every scene there's something wrong with every single thing's wrong
with every scene doesn't mean it's the worst there could be worse things right no but but it's it's
not just that it's every scene is bad and there are several scenes where it just destroys everything
and not only does it destroy everything in the movie it's destroyed by all the things around it
and it makes no sense ever are you trolling are you fucking with us we need to watch we need to
watch dr strange again because i feel as if that movie was just a mess i don't necessarily disagree
with that of the bad ones you know we got okay first up captain marvel then i've made three
then black we have to do with movies for dr stranger i will make you fun yes we we can let's
i think that dr strange is e-fat moviable i agree i think that yeah yes we could talk
about all the problems that make it awful still not as bad as captain marvel
it might be no it's i already know the answer to that question it's just no it absolutely might
be i think that your your love of bindi snatch cummerbunk is clouding your judgment you just
want to like uh don't you remember i was the poo poo when we were watching dr strange i was
the poo poo or no no no no no no no i was remind him because you you guys would rip it into me for
being like oh you have a problem with all these things these things are good i actually had a
problem with no no what happened was um we were watching it and i came into it like i i enjoyed
no no no what what happened was it became apparent to me that my opinion of the film was wrong as i
was watching it because like it got worse and worse and worse oh sure and then i was just like
but i was the one who was saying that it was really bad from the start yes really bad no no
yeah but when we first saw well when you first saw it and then when we were first watching and
getting into it and stuff like i was getting comments like it's not i don't think it's gonna
be as bad as you're saying it is then i said that i kept repeating to you guys i know it's
the ghost fight scene the ghost fight scene i kept saying to you guys the ghost fight scene i
remember that you remember the ghost fight scene that was terrible um and then there was the
uh no the ghost fight scene was really dumb
i agree um but yeah but then there was the scene where um the ancient one fell from a skyscraper
and yeah and don't forget didn't die immediately they don't escape the mirror world when they can
they just keep waiting around and then kaisylia stops them remember there's like several moments
where they just look at everything being mirrored and it's like guys guys guys use the spinning
guys guys and they can use them in mid-air and they can move them as we know like so and uh
the fact that he beat those guys is kind of like a stretch the fact that he managed to beat those
guys in his first fight is like yeah but captain marvel is a literal disaster there's just nothing
about it that works and so i actually agree that these all go into like a tier if you put them in
like a tier list they'd be like the bottom tier but i don't think any marvel movie will be as
bad as captain marvel unless you get like captain marvel 2 i still think like captain strange will
be worse no i still i still think that like even even dr strange probably ranks higher than like
age of ultron on that list i would say i think age ultron is completely riddled the problem with
dr strange's one is that you could argue i'm trying to think of like is there any damage to
the mcu from dr strange um well i guess the idea would be that he could just do a time loop for
every villain you know fan ourselves come to bargain you know i've come to bargain try that
no he didn't he didn't but i guess the thing is is that you could always contrive a reason
whereas with captain marvel it's like you're impervious to damage you're impervious to harm
like you can never be beaten directly contradict things that are established
and they made her the inspiration for the team avengers which is just like oh yeah it's just
like one of those retcons it's like the avengers are named after her why would you do that
that movie's so bad i'm surprised i managed to get it all out in that two hours thinking about
it it's like it's tough talk about all those things because i mean i spent longer on an
episode of game of thrones yeah and game of thrones as as it turns out you got it wrong
because game of thrones is the most outstanding drama of the year yeah mauler why can't we can't
trust you about that how come we can't we can't we can't trust you about uh dr strangle
people talk about the disconnect between uh between like professional mainstream critics and
audience i mean what better example than that everybody who watches everyone hated that and
yet it's still won what did it win for what did it do that warrants that win because the writing is
awful they should have to explain why something won something in like to get a paragraph even
just a paragraph to explain something yes a minimum 100 word paragraph explaining why
this film slash show won this category or explaining the criteria right for for the
category so explain what you mean by now what the criteria is well i think this was uh because when
we went through the game awards categories it's like it's also nebulous and vague that you can't
figure out what they're looking for and it's probably the same at the emmys and stuff like
what is the criteria for most outstanding uh drama like what what's different from
best direction best writing or is it meant to be everything combined writing acting
directing special effects all that i mean i don't know i don't know it's not me i don't know
are we not going to tell us i mean i think they know they'd see it as a bad thing to tell us
this is uh this super chat section is going really well yeah we've gone through a whole
none since just aside the thing that we're going to there's more memes as well um i'll just collect
them as as we're going there are any picture ones i won't take though uh all right anyway
ray could have killed kylo in the last jedi after they both got knocked out ray was the first to
wake up and don't tell me she's not a killer five minutes after she killed three tie fighters with
a big toothy smile yeah but those were those were strange men in spaceships she didn't give a fucking
she didn't give a shit about you you know for a fact when they in terms of the filmmaking and
like this applies to a lot of films certainly captain marvel and i i would say ray in that
scenario killing tie fighters or destroying tie fighters is is not registering with a lot
of filmmakers that that's actually killing someone difficult yeah like these are the same
side of those in the same way that killing a stormtrooper with a random blast is kind of not
murder because they're it reminds me of helmets on that why do you think they all have helmets on
can't see their skin then you don't see any blood generally if they're they're all just anonymous
like robots they're just bullet fodder they're not like people with hopes and dreams and emotions
and families and faces even even the one who does have a face and emotions and he's barely a person
he reminds me of uh yeah it's not because he's black it's because he's underdeveloped before i
get chat on rick and malty where he says shoot the morty the robots he shoots flesh blood he goes
i've met the i don't respect that was something like that like the culprit yeah because he shoots
me he's like he's bleeding to death call his wife and children yeah i think that if you asked ray
would she ever murder someone as in daisy ridley she might actually go as far as being like
no and then remember like oh wait no i have a shot oh wait just just the idea that three
and then and then a fourth ship line up in a perfect straight line with one person with a
laser turret aimed precisely at the intersecting point intersecting line where all of them will be
that is like insane that's actually insane casually give her the greatest shot ever performed
on the millennium falcon it's her first fucking shot could you imagine like if it's saving private
ryan you know when um what was the name of the sniper i i should know this um yeah like if the
sniper got three people in one it just take you out of it completely one of the things i really
like about saving private ryan that sniper is awesome and he misses several shots he misses
occasionally yeah yeah like guys uh right marksmanship is hard it's hard to do as someone who
does it it is difficult to do i mean it's the it's the kind of thing that's um i was rewatching
battles from lord of the rings i think i mentioned it before but um in the battle of amon hen you can
see like uh aragon getting tired as it progresses like he gets progressively more tired and exhausted
and um and it's the same like dead devil with the the whole wi-fi scene in season one he's getting
tired and it's that kind of thing that really like sells the thing because it's like oh this is a
person this is actually a human being he's not invincible even in john wick they do a good job
of that yeah john wick has it too he he can't do it forever yeah he he does very clearly he gets
tired it's uh it's that really important humanizing element um and when you kill three
tie fighters that line up perfectly it just takes you out of it because it's like a video game
um anyway next one is uh there goes my child dating channel thanks youtube bye
what do uh shad was talking morning mass it was good to see so many fellow colonists on efap
oh i'm not a what i guess everyone in australia counts as well i'm not sure oh even even me i guess
all right still loving the content slice and dice you massives of course slice and dice
slice and dice with a saber uh efap especially hates orphan kids oh yeah yeah uh shad would
you recommend a chainsword versus a spider um well i imagine it would work good against a spider
because spiders aren't particularly like tough next time we have him on i'm gonna ask him what
would actually be the greatest weapon in his in his collection that would be best against spider
uh i guess it depends on what spider we're talking about if we're talking about Australian spiders
yeah are we talking about australian spiders or the slightly smaller spiders from lord of the
rings elephant spiders yeah rhino spiders uh this event just ended an event that featured over 50
french streamers slash youtubers they raised over 3.5 million euros for the
pasture institute go team baguette all right also hi right hello hi stop streaming while i'm at work
i mean you don't have a choice someone's someone's always at work true there's always someone at
work what do you what do you want to do what do you want to do rags you just don't appreciate
good rat i do appreciate good rat i like rat um rags i still poop with the door open and i'm
gonna do it at your house one day that's the strangest threat i've ever heard
i'm gonna i'm gonna come to your house it's a threat open i i guess if someone's saying
they're gonna come to my house and poop with the door open like come on no one says you know
i'm going to see that shit yeah okay so you i don't want to see your door poop
how can pepa use her armor when by tony's admission she never wears anything he makes for it
i mean i i doubt i think it's fair to assume that she's been trained to use the armor in the five
years um and i'm sure he was referring more to casual clothing rather than she wouldn't wear the
suit because she doesn't like it like she would obviously wear it when she has to help people
that's i'm sure uh now lads it's been very fun but i will have to leave now after like nearly
eight hours uh would you like to plug your channel sir uh sure i got the friggy channel i'm sure i'll
do something with it at some point it's only been like a year and a half um i'm doing a podcast
cosmoronic be recording episode six in about a week on location so that'll be an exciting one
um and i'm working on an animation that i teased on twitter and probably follow me on twitter for
that um i'm on twitter too much i fucking hate it but i'm it's like it's like a train wreck that
you know that uh scene in call of duty like world war two where that train gets derailed and just
keeps coming and it doesn't stop and then it hits every single thing that's what twitter is like to
me um but yeah that's that's what i'm working on so hopefully a cartoon soon and then hopefully
some more cartoons after that i'm quite excited but it's a lot of work and a lot of stuff going
on at the minute but this was a good reprieve from that uh from like assignments and work so
thank you i hope you had fun sir oh yeah it was great all right have a good rest of the
stream guys i'll catch you later you bet see you later what another doctor strange isn't terrible
i love it i enjoy carol denville terrible oh yeah that ended with also high rags oh hi there
oh how are you oh and shad what fictional sword did you like to own i will keep that question
for him i do my best with keeping the questions but even i fuck that up so i'm sorry if don't get
answered eventually um e-fapping into my birthday best present so far i raise a glass of sparkling
rhino milk to all you massive also a strange ghost fight was just disney testing for episode
nine force ghost fights oh no that might be true though i was what is it like you know the whole
it's like oh no hopefully that doesn't happen i'm like no no we want this to happen now okay
they might though they actually might we want to have fun with it so maybe it makes a thing
it's a good thing that it makes us go with the flow um and accept what they want to uh hey you
massive today's my birthday so how about a shout out may the memes and tisms flow freely um happy
birthday vasa yeah happy birthday why are you guys talking about dr strange spider man came out
what sometimes you just get to a point in your life where you you got to talk about one or the
other you didn't know uh we chose dr strange i'm sorry spider man's gone guys gotta get over it
not in the mcq i'm still curious if they're actually gonna bring him back because uh
the money they'll lose you then i think there's been talk about whether or not apple's gonna buy
sony have you heard about that i've heard of it oh god the idea being that they buy them and then
they force them to let spider man back into the mcu it's just like goodness what a strange timeline
we're in um sorry molar and company could you please say things will get better don't give up
up things will get better don't give up things will get better don't give up yeah things will
get better don't give up things will get better don't give up things will get better don't give up
i enjoy the work i've seen i could use words of encouragement for people i respect so thank you
with ten dollars yeah man keep at what work it is that you're doing i hope i hope it works out
yeah don't give up um ha ha i made efap a little bit longer also hi j well
wow time stone luckily jay wasn't around for this one
time stone is the most underused and op mcguffin in the mcu there's a ton of op time
manipulation powers like dr strange could have sped up thomas's time suite agent of dust
yeah who knows what oh shit yeah because you can move it forward and back he does that in his film
time stone is broken yeah and now that we know how endgame goes infinity wall is so able to be
scrutinized even more so because that was apparently the best outcome it's like dude
they were better outcomes
get gamertron on you massive
okay i i don't take kindly to such horrific demands gamertron is the one that
that has requested a couple times come on um i don't know well maybe it'll get around to one day
i just guess lists we got a lot of a lot of things to get through uh currently making a
buffy angel viewing order how did you both how did you view both shows back to back by airing
order through crossovers online guides so obviously i watched all of buffy and then all
of angel because that's how they came out back in the day um and i didn't get into angel until
after buffy had finished but there is a viewing order you can google it's um it's like a a blog
spot page that was made in 2012 but it basically has a listing that'll explain to you how to watch
the episodes in order for both seasons to stay in continuity so uh just google it it is findable
um my brother almost walked out of i am i'm and three after the mandarin twist because mandarin
is his favorite character but he loves luke and tlj i don't get it i don't get it either man
yeah that's weird um just don't seem right love the new rags video i want to pat you furiously
yay i was from kivakins the app website create oh i'm doubly glad then i'm really i really am
glad you liked it when the uh that new is like a new animation in the beginning right or at least
a new yes yeah and hopefully that one will get slowly but surely added to as time goes on
uh molar in your videos you like to have characters lip read to what you're saying
how do you know how do you know character and what moment to use must take forever
yes lots of experimentation and then there's lots of like i remembered a character saying something
similar or um an expression they have that'll be suitable um it's tough but i i always like
kind of doing it there's a lot of ones that sync up can be very satisfying with the wick uh it's
interesting how the mcu kind of mirrors the varying core of the quality in the comics
how different writers can ignore or even change things between books
yeah and i wish they took it much more seriously like what they're dealing with in terms of you
take on someone else's work and your work will be something someone else has to continue
so be careful like try and leave things in a position that makes sense otherwise someone
else is going to have to try and make your work make sense instead of working on their own thing
which is you know the lame for them uh was trudoe's prince a li audition better or worse
than the guy who actually got the role in a lad in live action remake yeah have you seen the rags uh
fucking what's his name the canadian prime minister is it just you know yeah yeah that picture got
leaked of him wearing black face yeah i don't know what's gonna how he's gonna be able to deal
with that from the people on his his team if you will because that's a purity tastic nightmare
but um yes i'm sure he could have starred in aladdin uh also high rags hello more i remember
in efap 40 you were really looking forward to a post endgame thaw and how they're gonna treat
him how do you feel about love and thunder is it gonna be any good um so like my position on
thaw was probably soured a little bit more since that efap oh but um i'm still like they could
still do a good job for him in a theoretical fourth or four i mean if they if they explore
him a whole lot more than i mean they could in guardians if he has a prominent really prominent
role and a lot of it is focused around him sure i don't think it's an irredeemable thing
it'll be tough yeah there's lots to be concerned about love and thunder but
gotta wait until we get some some more info i think it's gonna be shit aussie aussie aussie
the only reason dolmamu came close to absorbing earth was because an evil wizard helped him
fewer wizards equals fewer chances that happens no it's not it's the destruction of the the like
the four things that prevent him from entering the dimension the idea that the idea that that
mordo was doing it in order to prevent adormamu in future isn't even the case he literally just
argues that it's about large power shouldn't be able to be used by people and he's going to use
his power to take it from people while simultaneously having to reconcile the fact that this large power
just saved his own universe it is the most nonsensical thing ever and i hear it um and the
film doesn't the most nonsensical thing ever maybe i was being hyperbolic oh no no no it's that you
had a you had a froydian slip i mean have you never said that froydian type of ball it's little
lily lily hmm no it's too late it's on camera it's the most nonsensical thing ever you heard him
say it chat but you back me up yeah i did i was referring to you saying it too late you just said
it yeah that's right i did because you said it and it should be said an intention doesn't matter
rags you've just said yes it does no yep mine didn't so neither does yeah yeah it does oh you
said exactly what you meant that was a that was a froydian slip like fringy said no i meant it
hyperbolically it was supposed to be you had a you had a froydian slip you had the slip of froydian
you talking about the philosopher froydian froydian the no the psychologist froydian
philosopher because he worked with no he's also a philosopher no no no no we're talking about
froydian the psycho largest oh the psycho largest yeah no i'm okay fine fine you win i fucked up i
i didn't know you were speaking about the psychologist what other what other froydian
could there be you know what no froydian could ever match up you're right there's only one
froydian in my life and that's sigmund froydian god damn it i'm late hello gentlemen oh hello
hi my friend says she doesn't have the patience to watch lord of the rings how do i convince
her to watch him it's fucking slap her and fire her to the chair doesn't have the patience
patience uh i don't know has she watched two movies before in a row because that's yeah man
you could argue that just pop of orange is the pop of orange okay uh wasn't disney being
yeah the little v coat for allegedly cooking their books i think it calls into question how
much their live action remakes actually make i'm i'm happily convinced that they make a buddy
i i'm sure people go to see them what i don't think is that people a lot of people come away
loving them as much as what they fell in love with back in the day because they really it's
just a hollow remix but i can believe they're making a lot of money sadly it's the reputation
of something like the lying king that people go and see it again it's like yay recapture childhood
yay introduce my children to it and it's like you already can you can use the old i mean it doesn't
matter what they make the movie it doesn't matter how good or how shitty they are because
people buy the tickets you'll just buy those tickets people just beat them up num num num
malon lady in the tramp lion king fucking it doesn't matter how shitty it is gonna buy those
tickets gotta gotta watch those disney films i imagine the people in our audience probably don't
yeah and people in our yeah it wasn't people in our chat but i had this discussion actually this
weekend yesterday at a at a party there were some people there talking about some disney
movies and stuff and they were all just talking about how excited they are and whether or not one
of them said i hope it's good and i said it doesn't fucking let's just be honest it doesn't
matter if it's good or not it doesn't matter if it's good or not you're you guys you bought you
guys have already decided that you're gonna see them and you're gonna spend all the money on the
tickets it doesn't even matter if it's good or not they went well that truths but you know that's my
episode probably the end of the skywalker saga it's like uh was it this is oh oh is that oh
this is that what we're calling it now all right sure efap gaming trouble in terrorist town when
yes we have to play ttt maybe yeah maybe in the future then i love ttt what are your thoughts on
three-dimensional moms mo ms yeah my mom's three-dimensional she's all right i think most of them
are aren't they yeah yeah they're cool uh thoughts on rambo and critical reception i'm hopefully
going to go see it in the next days ish and i find what people have been saying about it
pretty funny and i want to go see it just to see what made them say what they said
uh what was it rags the quote like it's a bag of hat wearing braces it's a it's a trump
dystopian nightmare that hates mexicans and it's pro-trump and it's maggot country you know sorts
of stuff i can't wait to see it i've heard from multiple people now that it's good and i'm legit
i legit want to see it yeah there you go um are the criteria used to evaluate objective
quality and media established as a valid criteria a priori by the nature of the medium
like elements necessary for a story for a post priori conclusions reached via mutual agreement
it would be uh pre as in what's intrinsic to what makes a story can be broken down
and then the degree to which it falls away from being that it uh it was actually i was talking to
for me about this yesterday it's um a quality argument made from quantity it is um an ought
derived from an is is is a couple of ways to try and translate it but if i was to go into more
detail to explain the fundamental sort of way i try and line it all up uh we'd be here for a lot
longer but um it's a fair question and uh the the mutual agreement one like the idea that that's
that's what's happening i mean there'll be certain arguments that'll probably be reliant on that like
a group of people come to a conclusion about what something should be and then you have like a fifth
person jumps in way later like that's bullshit though because blah blah blah and then the four
people might be like oh right yeah and they missed something because of the fact that
a bit of a bias that they didn't quite see but the criteria is essentially established before
you've even seen the movie um typically especially with storytelling
dad what do you think about oh wait yeah well opinions are usually wrong so
we get a lot of interesting quotes on this show don't we we do it's strange i wish people would
stand by them once in a while weirds only have one definition and opinions that was so that was
a weird one words only have one definition man that was a weird one that's like hmm yeah oh uh
give me a second i'll be right back that's a question for uh pronounced adeptus custodis
dumb mauler
i don't know how to pronounce that but i'll i'll read it for him once he's uh once he's back
i mean shad uh hey mauler shad fringing robot head i think that's everyone
oh can say hi back to that um how can being in shape and looking good as a power fantasy for
men but not for women i think that there'd be an argument to be made for women have power fantasies
it's just not something that typically has talked about i think
like um not because we don't want to talk about it but because i like it seems
maybe it's unseemly like some people don't think that it should be uh discussed because it's almost
like a criticism of the person in some way people often use um men looking for a power fantasy as
as like a bad thing um but yeah i think you know like you know have women who played doom
and fucking love the power fantasy they get from that doesn't have to be the uh doom guy
is not a girl but the idea that probably get some form of a power fantasy out of any kind of strong
female character and a lot of different uh pieces of media is yes definitely possible
would it be better if everyone was topless fringo croakins
wait did fringy say that fair enough uh finally called one of these properly and with some of my
favorite guests no less hurrah for australia also hi shad i'm sure he would have said hi back hey maul
what's something about the ot you can admit is objectively bad the fucking nonsense in jabba's
palace at the beginning of return of the um the fact that the a-wings would fly towards
the walkers the beginning of empire when they take like a million years to turn around
so the obvious thing would be to fly around the back of them
flying toward them their view is probably not the best and then um
um no yeah there's probably more be only asked for one so i did it um dad very much like shadow
the conqueror picked the audio vision up and recommended two other people i'm sure he would
appreciate that my jedi outcast review is going up on geeks and gamers this week in time for the
console ports and has a montage of star wars amputations set to patrick williams preaching
the films are for kids excellent work mark so high rags he'll he'll pick those up once
okay i'm back we just had a high rags oh hello i've always liked the female led action just
look at my stuff i've animated and i've distinctively recalled during university a classmate got tilted
at me because the girl i made had cleavage and exposed thighs 2014 no women show their cleavage
in the public especially people don't women don't do that do you have to go out in real life all
women of very much pretty much hiding everything giant blankets see them shifting through the
streets does the people actually think that it's unusual for humans to want to display their assets
their assets say yeah their assets it's like the like a liability but
it's like a weird liability those are snow speeders more than not wings oh i said a wings
yeah i mean i'm i'm running on low energy right now but um the ships in in the beginning of empire
they're not a wings okay uh late 70s early 80s john burn for the win i'm not sure what that's
must be a comic book artist oh yeah that would make sense when linkara does the last jedi comic
why the comic yeah yeah he reviews comic oh i'm haunted by phasma saying actions and character
would you say one punch man is objectively bad because a normal person can't become that op
with his strength training or is it okay because it's consistent in the laws of the stories universe
well if we're going strictly by season one then i think we all assume that there's something
else going on and that we're going to figure out what the truth of the matter is because
no you can't become that strong from just the the regiment that he talks about um if they never
explained it it wouldn't necessarily be a contradiction because everything is running
as it's been displayed to be in the we just we don't know what truly gave him that
but we wouldn't necessarily need to though i i think yeah that's a really
change anything or as i understand about the story uh men ruin star wars women ruin society
perfect balance does all things should be okay clearly women would improve everything if they
were men look at the women something to work for if captain marvel had to fight superman who'd win
i mean she's immune to everything he's not immune to everything because of kryptonite
so she'd just get kryptonite you'd stab him through his heart with kryptonite he would just
me to him he's got some old tweets that are very controversial very controversial superman tweets
back on oh he was he was criticizing all kinds of things pick them all up
dale's video is basically please don't hashtag me to me
one could argue jews are running x ruining x but i'm not attacking jews well as the thing if you
just trade it out then for another group uh the video suddenly becomes totally not allowed which
you know you could you could blanket statement men and white people all you want you never get
you know it's fine don't worry about that do the same to blacks or jews or women oh man watch
yourself it's good to catch a live one perfect timing for fringy land people have any of you
guys bought slash played borderlands 3 yet i'm morally torn on it i'm not touching it i'm not
touching it and i'm not buying anything from the epic game store yeah really really that's
simple as it is for me hello to efap's best boyo borf hello my experience is people with a proper
understanding of anatomy can pull off the same movement and idealization bad anatomy for style
is no excuse well i don't know about bad anatomy for style i'm not sure about that i mean i think
there's uh yeah i think if if you change people's proportions in order to have a style or each
character is supposed to be you know if they look a certain way because you want to portray a certain
i guess physique type you know that's one thing but where it but if you're going to be inconsistent
with it just to i i don't know um like if if someone has to do something plot related and he
changed their physique to do that like if a guy's supposed to be big and buff and then all of a
sudden he has to fit through like uh like a ventilation shaft or something so you he's sort
of size you know just so we can fit through and oh that's where you have it right and i think that
was more directly on fringy and shad i think in their conversation they said that um in sacrifice
anatomy for a style i think but uh yeah it's an interesting conversation to say that uh maybe yeah
i don't get those funko pops they're like they're like nano nendo droids
and they're right and droids tendroids i think i've heard of them i think you're something similar
nendoroids yeah i'm not sure but poor and intellectually deficient nendos are at least
cute these pops are creepy people love them and i don't know like this is the i don't have any
from what i remember but i i feel like everyone sees them as a sort of um easy gift and cool
thing to have in terms of the meat that you like and there are psychos out there who will literally
go out and buy every single version of every single thing of every single set of which i'm
not even sure if like i wonder if there's like a list online there probably is and i'm curious how
many funko pops there are now no a lot uh don't make fun of lando funko rags that's his wife's
black son's favorite toy he oh i noticed he said my family he didn't he wasn't like
kid so yeah maybe he lives with his parents maybe not i don't know could be both the question is
still up in the air oh yeah i don't know we didn't really see uh see about what like
potential career was because he said he was a part of like a network for youtube right i'm assuming
that was he used to be well no he used to be part of the network that was network 1901
was the name of the channel that it was on that's why it was different and honestly you can make
a video like that and expect that's the thing like videos like that are all over the place you're
a bad person if you hate star wars or you hate women if you would that's it i was like how do
you think people are going to react to it do you think a lot of networks want to have that kind of
message on their channel and stuff you have like buzzfeed apparently like
rather foster that rather than we did yeah i think that um i would i wouldn't say that
most places are like buzzfeed oh absolutely i'm just saying there are a few out there and i don't
know what oh yeah there's some network was like maybe this and a lot of them are and a lot of
them are dying too so there's always that remember that one time where there was a devil's advocate
to keep the conversation fresh if you're being sarcastic steiner at the very least the guy came
on so what more do you want like i mean he he had the chance to come on on the podcast on when he
was getting into to ideally defend his ideas he didn't really do that but you know he could have
you know that was an option and plus it's not like we were going hard on him
yeah and a lot of what we were talking about in in the section covering his video was a lot of
just discussion about a lot of his like thing he was a vehicle for discussions between us about
things yeah we weren't really getting much out of him yeah like it wasn't like he required an
advocate we were just like he would say something we'd be like okay let's try break this down and
talk about it um and yeah he didn't exactly seem to want to support what was the broad
statements of his video anyway so i don't know what advocate you'd be looking for exactly
catman joe is not responsible for this please leave his stream alone
i guess that's a relation yeah we were getting catman joe spammed a lot oh yeah yeah i don't
know i have no idea what that's about i don't i don't either i i don't i don't know uh rags
what is your problem with funko pops oh it's just it's just like the meme um like reputation
that they have they're the stereotypical thing that you know nerd shill types have all the time
yeah they're always in like i don't actually think lesser of one's character if you own funko
pops yeah and that's i was bringing up earlier there are arguments people can make against like
merchandising and buying into it and all that stuff but like i don't
myself i don't really have an issue you can have like excessive amounts
like there's people who walk into their house and it's just funko pops everywhere and you'd be like
okay i mean yeah whatever float but um yeah there there is just the whole the pretty sure
like you look at red letter media's podcast set right for nude crew and it's just stuff
yeah stuff everywhere figure it just um so the guy's apparently a minecraft youtuber and he has
no idea what's happening just wanted to let you know well yeah you can do that was about the uh
oh is he a minecrafter i think he's playing that minecraft he's at now all right hi rags hello
the stream you did with sargon last week about the aljazeera video was outstanding yeah oh yeah
that was a fun one i'm glad you liked it uh for real i really appreciate the wit and directness
with which you opposed what the video was advancing oh i'm i'm uh i'm glad that you
liked it we did we we uh we tackled it with all the fun and me could tackle a video subtly
implying there should be a race war uh i'm glad we get to hear crazy drunk or just silly rags
oh i'm tom not drunk i've i'm not drinking at all i had way too much to drink less
i am not touching another drop uh not for now at least when ray meets kylo she'll just thanos snap
who knows they might get married and have children like we never know what's gonna happen
it's insane yeah because remember ray she's beaten him like three times sort of now like
two and a half times at this point like man what are they gonna do
yeah well i'll be walking to that cinema like oh god here we go
we're about to get the answers of what the fuck were they gonna do with episode nine
i'm so excited i really am so excited for episode nine i want to know what happened
i want to know how it ties together all of these loose threads
it's something i just watched efap nine luke milking the alien makes sense because it's
disney milking star wars for all it's worth i can't disagree with that it's it's that you
can't just you see it's the it's the adjacent metanarrative of the milking scene that you can't
ignore i wonder if i wonder if movie what would appreciate that if i said it's a metanarrative
it describes the disney milking well it's like there's nothing that you can't say oh it's a
metanarrative in defense of and once they say uh-uh they're like oh so there's criteria and
standards by which you judge whether or not something is either a good or a or a sufficient
metanarrative boogie deadass said a chris raygun joke seriously well this is the thing i feel like
we would make jokes like that on efap like at least rapists believe in themselves or something
like that yeah but he said it in defense like an occupant it's like no uh internet trolls are the
apex evil at least rapists believe in spreading too much bread over butter boogie boom bag fail
yes boogie boo bag fail would have said that uh the critic is the risk you take the critic
out and you have some round-headed moron making people mad yeah well this is the thing saying
the the creator the critic doesn't take any risks so be like oh there's times where people
yeah people's reputations can live and die on their criticism
you gotta you gotta make sure you your takes are accurate or you've done the work you maintain
integrity there's lots of risky elements to being a critic um the complaint about movie
critics is just commies trying to push the labor theory of value doesn't matter how much you worked
on it uh the tweet from stuckman is ripped from the end of ratatouille yeah i saw a couple people
on twitter saying that he's essentially just uh ripped off the speech at the end of ratatouille
the whole like appreciate that the the the work anyone could be a cook that the the wonderful
sort of elements of ratatouille um stuckman however doesn't quite maintain the charm of
of the film stuckman is extremely uncharming and uninteresting he mixes the two together
in a way he he has the perfect amount of uninteresting bread that is being scraped over
with the uninteresting butter it's like a butter that's yeah you're like what is this is this water
and you're like yep clear butter uh i used to be chris stuckman fan until his tlj review came out
that's when i woke up to his bs an efap on his video would be a good idea um maybe we've said
before that if ever we were to cover him it would probably be preferable to wait for a subject
we're familiar with um and maybe something new that sort of encompasses a lot of what i have
in terms of issues with this but um i don't know this is the problem with chris stuckman videos
they are he just he's the the bomb of the barrel meh criticism if you can call it that
like if you think that you are good enough to do what chris muck uh chris stuckman does then
yeah you're correct you are
thank the dawn you guys streamed i just finished the last episode and needed my rhino milk fix
keep being as epicness and celestial as always guys thank you well sure of it
amala thank you for the great content no pro blame oh king animus thank you for
pulling it great um stuckman has a series called hilariosity i think you can understand there are
shit movies and that should be laughed at well yeah oh yeah they all do it just sort of contradictory
to their whole thing it's the they have this mindset where they're like it's all subjective
until you bring ones like the rumen and they're like okay we know that one's not subjective and
you're like what do you mean you can't say that you can't just like do you not understand by saying
that you've established a criteria and it's like no this is that was bad though other ones i like
though i find a critic who loves the room and explains the themes of the room
um are women fans either fans of star wars who are women or fans of women who are into star wars
women women like to wait what well i mean it's in reference to his video the confusing like
thing about women fans the fans of star wars who are women or fans of women who are into star wars
i'm not even sure like what would you be the second one um i mean he didn't stand he didn't
necessarily stand by the statements anyway no it's kind of a shame uh wish meme repository
happy birthday too yeah happy birthday dude oh meme repository happy birthday
uh don't have time to watch now but i need more mauler content i'm still mad my efap 50 super chat
was missed it said hi raggers and meowler oh well there you go oh hello hello for that one uh dale's
a mansplainer saying women love disney star wars dirty dirty man thanks for covering the
vid i sent you thanks maul no problem if you were the one who sent it yeah um i get a couple
of different sources i get and i try and just check out enough of a video to be like is this
going to work is it not and man yeah that was that was an interesting um creators should be
honored that their work is analyzed to such a degree so they can improve many people don't even
get that attention or help yeah someone say that the worst thing is just to be ignored yeah
uh oops misspelled my last chat meant to say it was miss red not missed oh yeah nope
i knew shad would be on efap after a 30 minute video covering four minutes of anime yay
only girls i've seen liking tlj a tumblr tier ralo shipper commies you know disney target audience
i mean the whole ralo thing i don't know why people are so into that
but yeah i don't what do you guys see is it purely just a sexual fantasy
thing where it doesn't have any grounds at all in reality logic you're just thinking with your lady
dick uh great stream bro also say hi to rags for me hi rags oh hi mauler wait shad is back i thought
he's dead treks roar well yeah he apparently did survive i mean we watched the um the meme video
where he came back right i think what happens next to him in the in this was when you hold the
position that everything is subjective your arguments will resemble an esha painting every
argument will loop back illogically well yeah when you've maintained that as a foundation all
of the arguments are going to eventually cross over and contradict each other because you'll be
doing everything in the moment so like you end like like h bomber guy saying that ds2 was complete
and it's incompleteness like sorry what like double take and uh the longer it goes on with a critic
the more you'll find things like hey wait but they said this before now this this yeah it doesn't
matter it's just my opinion you're like oh i subscribed because i thought you were really good
at like breaking the thing down not just because you happen to like it or didn't like it at the time
you know it gets uh english is the best screw all other languages yeah english is the tits i mean i've
just i don't really mind what language it would be i just wish that it pretty much was just one
language across earth the clarity because most of the time people who use english don't even
really get how to use it and i'm not saying that i'm i'm not one of those people
like if it was all just one language we'd probably be at a point where we can focus
on actually getting better at using it instead of trying to figure out translations for everything
but that has a lot of cultural implications um and historical ones but yes english is
i agree with baller um yeah british empire version two let's give it another shot gents
jolly good just just yeah there's no no harm in trying it again i'd say nothing really the first
one was a warm up uh training to be an electrician good wiring like anything is a form of art therefore
if i fix a breaker with a subjective theme that it won't kill me i'll be fine oh be careful mr
electrician um i won't be watching live just wanted to pop in and say thanks for making my
commute to college everyday bearable have a great stream also hi rags hello hi sesame street was
brought to you today by the letter six on the number e here since the original six movies were
based on world war two any decent sequel trilogy should have been based on the cold war imagine
the remnants of the empire or the new republic descending into communism um i think there's a
lot of potential for like the growing frustration of maybe a an awkward piece that was established
with a faction of an empire that was still trying to just maintain a planet let's say
for a selection and then maybe a thing could be that several planets start to join their union
and the concern for the republic is that quite there being peace they're getting more powerful
you know and then you can have elements of the cold war happening there um i think
yeah imagine it was it was actually character-based and neither faction was you know good or evil
necessarily yeah you could be watching lord of the rings right now yes he could that's true you
could have screw me i missed two hours of efap because i was rewatching that good but subversive
show called the boys start watching two seconds ago judging from the title this guy sounds like a
a homo that deserves to be decapitated by lasers jesus christ well you can guess that's ra right
oh yeah i was about to say if the only reason we dislike tlj is we hate women could one argue
the reason they like it is they're racist fin is a bumbling stereotype caricature
i suppose that would have been an interesting one to throw back when you spoke about the prequel
thing um if they said the only reason they like it is because black people are in it
i don't know if that makes them racist it would be a weird fucking
say though but i guess they kind of do say that right the whole diversity thing they're more
concerned with what the people look like rather than they are so um definitely yeah well if we
said if we said we only like it because there's a white person in it you know what they oh yeah
what we'd be we'd be uh that that wouldn't look yeah we talked to you how could you say that it's
so disgusting wrong uh thoughts on wonder vision leading directly into doc strange two i'd be more
annoyed if both weren't my most anticipated things of phase four as wonder and vision of my favorite
avengers objectively uh yeah i'm gonna try out the one division thing seems like it could be cool
it's going to be dependent on the trailer for it i don't know what they're up to and then doctor
strange two is the one out of all the things in phase four that i actually wouldn't mind seeing
from name alone again trailers are probably going to direct me on these ones um also the wallet uh
to criticism thing only applies to the studio people like ryan johnson and dumb and dumber get
paid the same amount regardless yeah that was weird because when he said matters i'd like it
was really dependent on who he was saying that in reference to like matters to what disney
matters to the bottom line matters to the creators matters to the people i don't know
yeah i mean if people i mean people's attitudes and the money are inextricably tied to one another
it would be insane to imply that they're not the same or not well not the same but they're not
related thoughts on new joker movie watch mde world piece i have not seen it and i'm probably
now going to wait until it's released i did want to see it in the cinema but too many things got
in the way and i'm not sure if it's still there but either i'll see it this week or i'll wait
until it's out there's a possibility and i don't i'm assuming you haven't seen it right no i haven't
needs to have a chat with me i'll let him know how terribly bad tlj actually was from a woman's
point of view ps l337 was garbage this is the thing oh i should have asked him does he think
that l337 was a parody character or not he i have no idea he seemed uh very nervous general and so
i had a sense that he might have wanted to just uh sort of get the conversation finished and
establish that he's he doesn't really hold the positions of a lot of the things he said in that
video and so stuff like i think we established that pretty clearly yeah like the whole women do
x or think x and men do x and think x like all of that you could just um i just watched kung fu
panda trilogy and loved revisiting that series but got sad because so many brands of damage
nowadays there's only a matter of time until this one's ruined too yeah yeah well isn't there a kung
fu panda like a tv show i don't know actually there might be i know that there's three movies
they're four movies i think there's three uh and i can't man like i haven't seen them in ages
so like i kind of don't even really remember them yeah but um but the idea that there's concern over
them being ruined uh i was on a podcast the other day talking about like it's like what else has even
left to ruin i was like the two that i've waited to be ruined are um back to the future and gremlins
those are two that i'm waiting by reboots remakes sequels whatever um yeah i'm surprised they haven't
been touched for this long and i know that gremlins three has been back and forth in production
they're trying to get a thing started with that so it's only a matter of time really and this is
the thing if it's going to be like egi gremlins and like missing the tone of the originals there's
a lot of things that could happen and i know that um mike loves gremlins so that that would be a
probably a pretty good plinket video on the way if something like that happened at least you got
to think i think yeah i like gremlins a lot but if a bad gremlins remake came out i probably
wouldn't make any videos on it i just be like well another one bites the dust yep i hope you
enjoy you're still enjoying the first two i went to get food and you're still going law
s how long do you eat
i i guess a long time also i read that one out of out of order
fine i'll just read the rest i just rewatched oh yeah we got that one hi shad
great say hi back this kajuk he spelled he's i guess ra goes with kajuk instead of kuk
do they actually block kuk i would have thought they'd let you say that
really you can't say kuk why stop it rah please stop being mean and critical
me and my chad super soldiers we will drive you and your soy boy ilk to
he wrote sue and then space side like sue is i can't say sue well maybe he can't actually say
suicide no of course but the way he did it so like sue is in sue like over today but then side is it
like a side of a wall like not because i figure you could just put a space between in in the middle
of suicide and it'll work but yeah maybe i like i like these uh tactics to get past limitations
i'm sorry to inform you all that i hate women this guy on the internet told me because i think
last chad i was bad well that was targeted at the berry sue thing that was that was really
awkward by the way um i thought he knew that he'd said that if you know what i mean the whole um
yeah like i think that he hated the fact that that was a tweet he had done he was like oh for
fucks sake you know what i mean about the whole like like me and you having to defend that position
where we know that that's not our position yeah like yes i said that yes it's okay fine
yeah but we can generally defend the things we say that's the thing and i do want to clarify that
like if you say something stupid for whatever reason you should be able to be like yeah that
thing was stupid and i don't think that anymore like right yeah that's all you had to say
that's what i had to say yeah uh if you ever pause every frame of a movie bob video again
please join forces with razorfist to do it few can dismantle that charlatan as well as him
sure yeah we could save a movie bob thing for him we do have there was one we were going to
cover in the 50th we never got around to it so if we have razorfist we can have a movie
bob video i guess um yeah if you know 40k then argue caldor drago isn't a mary sue try
i'm guessing that's i'm going to save that for add add no 40k i do not know if he knows 40k much
do you know i don't know right i know of it i i have a journeyman understanding of it but i don't
really know who he is i don't know a lot of the individual characters um so if i told this brave
and stunning orphan that i didn't like bob effect he'd blow me but if i said ray had no development
or logical reasoning behind a power he'd spit instead of swallow that's sexist yeah i mean
i think he sounded like he'd be willing to hear arguments for why she was a poor character
and it sounded like with the criticisms he had of boba that there is such a thing as a bad
character according to him so maybe there's a discussion to be had there hopefully yeah maybe
uh starting from the beginning because i'm pooping in late popping in late happy birthday
shad have fun with your spaghet yes women are stupid and irrational and weak fash boy
oh i guess they're supposed to be fag boy probably what are you going to do about it
gonna cry shit your pants this guy's legs should be crushed ah no leg crushing so you're throwing
people of violence always with violence hey rags you handsome doggo hey i want to absorb
your bone density over and over and over hmm there's a lot of bone in there though if i met
this guy irl i would make him listen to more his entire tlj critique while i crushed him and stuffed
him into a single tiny funko pop box again the crushing and the stuffing uh yuzhou senki movie
has a mary sue as an antagonist oh um it'll probably be good around the discussion of what
makes one good or not um why are you talking about women when you get to look at women
i don't know sometimes it's just not enough no that's controversial this
what can i say
superman is also weak to magic and red sun energy as well as countless characters who can match him
physically bad writers will make him opie and uninteresting but a lot of good writers give him
plenty of great stories um shad literally every dip who's been covered on efap that's disagreed
with me is an ugly retard subhuman who should be sliced in half with lasers
i guess ras uses it all right daddy won't make such violence such violence daddy what makes good
rat well when a plot and a character love each other very much they get together and make a
bunch of little themes oh yeah any thoughts about the new article from comicbook.com disney's first
star wars plans were too much too fast according to chairman bog bog bog eiger bob eiger um it's
weird i mean it's weird because you look at the mcu and you got movies coming out all the time
yeah it's maybe the idea is that it wasn't it wasn't good
and i think it wasn't the whole like they they planned to do a whole bunch of things then they
pulled it all back because oh yeah they pulled out they pulled back a bunch of stuff yeah yeah
i guess we already knew that bob eiger felt that way because of those actions but um
yeah it makes sense they they think that they're obviously wrong about what's wrong
just make good shit and we'll watch it it doesn't yeah if it's good you got a whole fan base here
we're we're ready for it we're ready for that good stuff but if you don't make the good stuff then
well what do you think's gonna happen uh literally every cuz cuck cuck as as simps
and what is this ra there's so many words that are all spelt wrong
to be cleansed from the earth all right the end of the message was of course that a bunch of
the badminton's need to be cleansed from the earth uh chat if you ever meet someone like this
irl remember do not reason with them or validate them with arguments bully them relentlessly and
make them weep oh rah i'm not mexican bartha also put these sexy shoes on baller hey
hey rags hey how do you like your position as the gay world president
the gay world president i don't remember being i don't remember being elected i don't remember
you you nominate in like a way shape or form but apparently you got it nice work man oh thanks
i worked really hard on it yeah really worked long and hard on it to get this coveted position
in gay world it's not canon but there's some lore about the guy who operated the laser and
his guilt yavin wasn't blown up instantly because he couldn't do it again
it's not canon but there's some lore are you saying like fan fiction
i mean i would imagine that it there could be some psychological trauma that goes into
it would be pretty cool as a it may have been a cool idea to have that be something that plays
into the finale of a new hope in the the guy couldn't get over that that's what he had become
a part of and sabotage is a portion of the system or something yeah maybe um when shad says um it
sounds like armor i guess because the australian accent they say arm arm arm today crikey
bilbo fat my favorite lord of the wars character oh yes lord of the wars lobot reminds him of that
argentinian pool boy that pierced his maidenhood over margaritas oh no better i have syphilis than
be a virgin fair enough you know everyone you get to choose what you want you know hold
any of that against you uh luke traumatizes his nephew when he was about to kill him this guy
this is a ton of fun uh just dropping in during my break have a great stream guys thank you
murdering younglings total fun sad luke fun cloud emojis a theme is a word
film elitist used to invent value where none exists like how modern artists use
obscurantism to present to pretend their work isn't shit i don't know there's just an obscure
particular nature of the piece that's supposed to represent kind of net net you see supposed to be
something underlying the what you can see you see but you can't see you have to smell it
smell it smell it are you aware of the netflix movie coming out no tvember called the
i'll save this question the con second
also is this thing i told you about in efap 52 is this the thing i told you about i
maybe i don't know but not it's now been covered the call of kadulu contains fiction and therefore
is a silly fantasy book for kids me like i said i don't think he would stab by the argument i
don't think patrick willams would stand by whatever the argument he's trying to make is when he says
all that because if you if i was ever able to probe him on his stupid it's a space with his
movie for children i'd be like are you saying we don't we shouldn't take it seriously i don't think
you'd want to answer yes to that like are you saying children's content shouldn't be crafted
to a certain standard wouldn't agree with that and she's like so what the fuck was the point in
you saying all this no having some fun leave me alone opinion i'm so fun uh four children falls
apart when we know that star wars was written with archetypal mythology and ancient lore from
real world it was liked by young ones but the structure itself is universal cretins like this
can shove his all right uh last time i checked nobody defended the phantom menace saying it
was for kids and the movie has jar jar binks yeah like people didn't i don't think i saw any
arguments in favor of phantom menace saying hey it's for children it was interesting that that
sort of to really come to pass with with tlj like i don't think i've ever seen that argument
more so than with tlj people are desperate to make excuses for this movie
trial by combat and holding a piece of hot iron damn common law is cool yeah would you consider
having an efap on discussing how you could have fixed or rewritten the sequels after nine is out
i'd be happy to hear ideas of hate and passion flow for seven eight and nine
um it's a lot of expanded effort for what is essentially a process that
probably rather put into like actually writing your own story instead i mean i like discussions
on tweaks and then maybe a premise for a trilogy but like the first thing we probably do is like
yeah just wipe what we had go from the beginning again and more everything they
sort of complete rewrite it would take a long time we're probably just talking concepts but
this i'm not going to say is impossible um will you make another video game analysis i love them
i would say yes for the future but i don't know when exactly like i don't want to promise anything
about anything so but but i'd like to cover games again for sure yeah they take what you're fun
yeah they take what you're fun sorry yeah games are fun yes fun times fun stuff very fun
they take what you created away from you because they're inferior and can't make anything half as
good then they muck it all up because they they're worthless subhumans filled with spite then once
they've ruined everything they tell you it was silly space wizards or racist misogyny or dumb
west and civilization all along none of it ever really mattered in the first place
kind of yeah be the case with a bunch of media um this guy is why the germans have the word
rem remn and shaman shaman i'm i know that's not how you pronounce that but um
fair enough uh follow star wars in other words love all star wars movies no matter how bad
new product and get excited for next product maul's opinion of 2001 aso clockwick orange
the shining uh i like all of them the shining is probably my favorite 2001
and clockwick orange we're um probably use the word fascinating and uh i guess i can't really
go on further for any of them because dude i would have to open up a lot but um yeah there's
a reason why they're classics or influential good shit dr sigmund froydian dr sigmund froydian
i like that that seems so genuine this whole time fringy thought his name was froydian because of
froydian yeah i can see how that happened and i like it uh why don't we hear iron giant has great
themes of not judging others and you are who you choose to be followed by hooder space robot movie
for kids because that movie's good so it does this argument only is ever used on shit movies so
yeah it's weird how that works yoda train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose
maybe we should start let star wars and all these franchises go so we can get new ones
um but it's star wars the whole letting go thing it's like uh the main portion of money
these franchises make it from people who probably aren't doing any kind of critical analysis and i'm
not saying that as a derogatory thing like i want to watch movies so um we're never gonna go away
like these franchises will continue to make money i see that with like alien predator and um
accumulator they just keep coming back because of how good the originals were and they'll never
be letting go like how many years have to pass before the general public don't know what star
wars is like uh you have to wait for a while never yeah it'll take ages also high regs hello
feminists want to eliminate the male gaze get it the the gaze that are male
me too who killed most of his enemies be like luke
uh peter dinklage won best supporting actor for drama like i said i'm okay with that the one that
i just didn't want them to get was best writing and sounds like they may not have gone that one
but they got best drama which is bad yeah i'm not defending the star wars guy in any way but i see
where he might come from men and women think differently their brains are not are different
women don't care for substance as men but optics
style of a substance in a lot of ways oh yeah there's definitely differences there's no way
i'd be denying that um be a pie that is a reference to my video me shad six is not a letter shad
come off it we'll we'll have to see if you can make a full video about it explaining the the
letterness but tlg fandom is Scientology for poor people change my mind oh no Scientology for
poor people is just the worst because then you have to like buy a whole bunch of shit when it
comes to Scientology pretty much you have to like buy your tiers and then buy like materials and
feed or whatever it's like the biggest thing ever it's like college it's a scam i was gonna say i
think the star wars probably has better lessons than Scientology does it a very broad sense i
shouldn't really say that because i don't know anything about Scientology apart from Scientology
is like the fakest thing ever i just know the bit about um the new and the aliens whatever like
they don't tell you that till you start forking out the books i imagine that like you really
believed it and then they told you that bit after you paid like tens of thousands or whatever and
you're like yeah not really guys um Morley you missed my super chat from last week
oh no your one from last week was just wanted to say thank you more for converting me from loving
tlj to death to despising it passionately we removed you removed joy from the world mauler
i definitely read that out uh because i found that funny i remember finding it from
i can't believe you removed joy yes i did remove joy from the world i am so sorry
also let's stop bullying jay also high rags hello and no we're not gonna stop bullying jay
why would you request that is the gay uh i'm imagining myself repeatedly smashing this
balding cucks head in on a bathroom sink while yelling gosh raw fuck i know yeah
if my name was sage heiden all those people who call me a faggot would be right also high rags
hi mauler hello hi fringy hi shad and hi robo head they'd all say hi back
i bid the all adieu i must do a bedtism sleep well have a good night sleep tight and do not allow
the bed bugs to bite you yes and ironically won't be surprised at this point if this guy
said that star wars teaches us to have open borders kill babies and get rid of guns
just do what star wars tells you all of my political positions i take from star wars
like watching the ot as a chick as a kid he's like racism is bad that's right sweetie i'm glad
we i'm glad you watched star wars so we didn't have to teach you that racism is a bad uh that's
why throne was such an interesting character in the empire they didn't like aliens but he worked
his way to be one of the highest ranked officers in the empire that sounds like it would make for a
really good story like in a fully fledged high production film but i simultaneously i'm like but
if disney do it yeah disney disney's gonna fuck it up in the original canon very few aliens ever
got into the empire that's why throne was so famous because he was a high rank non-human all right
uh this dude looks like a massive fagot also hi rags hello empire should exterminate that xeno scum
cis were militant anarcho capitalists yeah i'd maybe you know you maybe there was who was
militant anarcho capitalists the uh the cis being the voids and the rampant anarcho capitalists
militants i don't know i don't know i don't know about that i'd have to read more into their like
actual policy positions yeah because this is the thing do we even know much about them outside of
them being a rebelling force yeah all i know about them really politically is that they didn't want
to be subservient to the republic they basically they wanted independence so i'd have to look
further into their actual political and economic positions to make that judgment because i don't
know uh i was radicalized by darth vader silly rags the force is female also hi rags hello
yeah the whole force is female thing is like sorry boys well see it's always for guys but if we make
it for girls it's fine because you remember how in the ot they keep saying the force is male
but do you remember all the times oh yeah the the famous scene with the um they the stuff
yeah all those guys oh yeah all those many as many scenes for us i remember that
and then there's that woman that turned up and then they all hit and they were like go away this
also look weird scenes like that a lot of people i often forget that that thing happened uh okay
that was epic grandma talking upon nuking alder on my toaster's racist epic my toaster is racist
it never burns my bread i don't i guess because the bread never is never black bread's blackish
i guess um what is what does being black and racism have to do with anything i don't understand
the connection nope i don't really i mean i don't get it i'm gonna hook up a rumba to a lawnmower
paint it to look like r2d2 and program it to run over this guy's head while it reads the bell
curve out loud jesus rock come on no violence the owl's droids aren't sentient because of
constant lobotomy they receive r2d2 is one of the few droids that was never memory wiped
yeah i think they they they mention that because like c3po keeps getting his memory wiped right but
they just don't with r2d2 for some reason i i don't remember the memory wipe stuff well they
they say and revenge the sith uh at the end because obviously c3po and r2d2
well at least c3po should remember obi-wan obviously yeah yeah yeah damn it better
one my toaster is racist it always burns my jewish eye your jewish eye interesting what
i mean yoda was an orphan trained in the way of the force by the dawn
oh that would explain a lot i was gonna say that actually does fill in a lot of blanks
it should be legal to kill people like this guy come on rah that's not even creative
yeah make a lord and kill this particular guy
emmy for drama writing the iron throne lost oh hey there you go apparently the iron throne
didn't get the writing the fact that it was even nominated i know what the hell is happening
that's the case like who honestly watched that and they're like yeah this is good writing
this is good stuff this writing i was just saying that that's where we're at where
that can happen but i don't know why i'm complaining because i guess
it's all subjective what are there are no standards there is no quality i was actually
gunning for the whole like this isn't the first time and most of the time whenever someone's like
oh you're gonna watch the oscars i'm like why so i can watch them get it fucking wrong
that's the thing you can be like how you know you don't know what their standards are you're like
you're right i don't they're not going to tell anyone so why do they mean anything anyway it's
like christy christy uh hey regs hello interesting fact there was a dog in world war one named rag
that was the mascot for the u.s first infantry division mm-hmm not true yeah but were the names
far more nope but i do know of it that is there's very nifty if droids could think there would be
none of us here would they obi-wan Kenobi seems pretty definitive droids don't have proper ai
i've always seen that as the films leaving it ambiguous unless part of my issue with solo was
the it seems way too definitive i like to think about r2d2 being sentient i don't like it if a
character says this thing is uh sentient droid writes droid writes like oh
oh
movies didn't really go into it besides a few snide comments the eu covered it a lot more
thrawn is a kiss and his whole world story revolves around the idea of it
um yeah yeah uh fair enough a lot of people have been talking about that a storyline with thrawn
regarding what you say about these people expecting everyone to have a woke interpretation
of everything during dartmouth undergrad i had to write countless papers with the correct takes
to get good grades uh to get good grades if we had to fix this mess we need to kill professors
in minecraft i think the the bullion off the road minecraft sir i like the idea kill the
professor in minecraft and it changes their ideas um yeah i've seen the error of my ways
yes rah this mother effer has the same energy as khal khal the cuck and aid skrillex
aid skrillex i know he's talking about uh not saying i'd eff his mouth but his mouth is wide
open you guys send weird super jesus that is fucking weird y'all are going to give us a bad
reputation yeah throw him off a roof already rah oh no too much roof throwing we need trampolines
and and suicide nets and stuff there's nets in general or flood the whole place so they
just fall in water i find it both amusing and sad that throughout all efaps someone this we
tod did isn't even top 10 dumbest takes oh right we we this we todded retarded i get it uh sorry
i'm a bit slow right we todded um what do you reckon in terms of this is the thing um i was
gonna say that i'd be willing to do this down the line but if if someone made like one of those
tier listings with all the people we've covered um it'll be interesting to see how it all stacks
up but this guy's probably pretty bad right out of all the videos we've yeah it's definitely a bad
video not a very not a very interesting um attempt to defend it either well i yeah i'm not
even including that part i'm just going from the takes in the video uh probably top five wisps
takes like efap probably there were some weird ones in there um the fact that robert's steel
shit means they need it that in reference to hmm what is that in reference to
i don't actually think i know oh it was from ron rosin chat rah what did that mean
no tell me the truth sir is that like a bike cuck thing
robot head should comment more love his incredulously amused voice also rags
bane impression bust me up
i'm not sure i might have i can't remember though
oh rus saying it's the fact that he said women need propaganda means there's a discrepancy
implying that if someone's stealing something then hey they need that something
i follow um and yeah uh robot head was having trouble with his microphone a couple of times and
i think there was probably a couple of times where like being five people makes it tough
for some people to jump in i know that i was trying to basically leave the um the debate part
to uh less people to make him feel like less of a pylon if you will but some of those things i
just had to get like some questions in you know some of those takes i just needed to some weird
ones get some answers um the fact that rapists need to great people means there's a need for
them to great people i suppose you could extend this the the propaganda thing very far the fact
people need to steal cars means there's a disparity because they don't have cars so they need to steal
them because they need it if women love star wars why do they leave when they see my empire strikes
back bedsheets i don't know man that's a good question good question uh canto bite could have
been about the military industrial complex rip eisenhower but no they went full marxist
well this is the thing um the criticism is so threadbare you profit off
creating weapons that are assisting wars that's bad
like oh
there are films that or at least stories that tackle that in a much more um
tailed way and explore the the wise and house and where the faults lie and what kind of um
participation each person involved has instead of just going
that person's rich because they sold a gun to somebody boo
anyway as if it's just that simple selling weapons is good
emmy for drama directing game of thrones season eight all episodes lost
oh did i thought that they'd won for one of the directing ones
well fringy mentioned that did they not i'm assuming they didn't from
oh that's who again i'm happy for them to not
get that yeah emmy for outstanding drama game of thrones season eight one
like i said about outstanding could be a lot of things uh when i step over there with all the
other shitty ones when i stab hobos in the street axe colleagues in the head in my apartment and
throw chainsaws onto the heads of whores from atop stairwells i'm gonna tell them all
i did it because of this guy's video you're a strange man rah very strange man well he's
taking someone down with you he's a barbie girl in a barbie world his arguments are plastic
because he's a spastic not had that one before uh that last one was a patrick bateman reference
to christopher no one's serial killer movies oh yeah i i caught that um the
it's it's an it's an interesting film no doubt um american psycho is one of those ones where most
people probably benefit from watching it in terms of exploring the the psychopath that is christian
bale also you said reference to christopher no one's serial killer movies has christopher
no one made any serial killer movies might be wrong i remember billy ones i don't know either
way i went to get oh wait there you go this was the one i read out of order by the way
uh i went to get food you're still going that's i should have read that now i've caught up i i
think this i don't think this person understands the the the nature of the length of efap of course
we're still going after you returned from eating you should be shocked if it was otherwise true
based season eight best season reaffirmed once again denoble is trash after episode two all the
great acting from scar scott what couldn't save the garbage writing in a million years really i
don't this is the thing if if there is garbage writing i'd have to be presented it because i
i didn't see it um if it's about like the realism there may be elements of it that i'm
completely unaware of but it seemed really solid to me yeah man you're gonna have to
yeah because i i adored Chernobyl which is not a statement you'd expect to make
isn't no typically most people did not enjoy the event of Chernobyl but they made a tv show
it was pretty awesome oh yeah the the tv show is fantastic but i also enjoy the fact that we
got a lot of dead comics just a second oh you should have said that to uh to the guest we had
instead of the holocaust she just said should people enjoy Chernobyl and then wait for him to
be like for the tv show you're like no the event yeah like no no of course not um i'm about an hour
behind and i saw chat explode about a game of thrones ami i think i don't know but i'll find
out when i get there more importantly i just beat boring the blind forest because both said
it was awesome good boring the blind forest is awesome glad you beat it because that probably
means you liked it uh hollywood is as incestuous as the royalty in game of thrones that's very
possible screw amelia clark laugh my ass off self-insert for pit mommies wine ants and woke
roasties everywhere here here were bendy my rightful throne i mean i still feel like i'm not
i don't know if that's criticism of the character or her acting but i thought
you're pretty well acting wise in in the final season uh he committed the fallacy fallacy what
a massive yeah the fallacy fallacy is when reference of fallacy and dismiss every argument
as opposed to you should be missing the relevant one i don't remember it
this subversive mother effer being open to conversation laugh my ass off i'm not having
a conversation with you i beating you until i can stuff you inside a funko but you said that
already ron you gotta you gotta swap it up you can't keep stuffing people into funko pop boxes
and throwing them off rooftops otherwise people are gonna accuse you of being boring you can't
have that i like shadow varsity his and nidrotik's cases against mcu spider-man despite not being
very well expressed changed my mind so that's great but that being said he tends to be a bit
long-winded and seems unaware of how he inappropriately dominates the conversation at time
i mean uh you could say that about any of us honestly a lot of us will go on
what you could call a tangent or a rant or an explanation of a particular side and
efap is the format for that one literally everything to take as long as it needs to take
and um if shad is explaining something um i i literally wouldn't mind him taking an
i'll just listen to what he has to say i'll just be like
yeah you know like i said he's no more guilty of like running on with something that i think that
i am as well like i don't i think it happens it's fine do you think we just go on and on and on
and just don't stop um hey you kind of beat some spaghetti bolognese true when we'll be in
the charade when will you finally say that enough is enough and quit this and go home to our
families your children when when don't you think we've just gone up long enough child ren child
run child kylo ren yeah child kylo ren molar i might hate this guy more than patrick willams
i mean oh no no patrick willams would can you imagine patrick willams coming on efap holy shit
that'd be so funny you guys are watching movies wrong
i just feel like i can't believe you're here like sorrowland it's very strange very strange
fkm this guy mundane matt adam conover i don't know is that a question isn't that the adam ruins
everything guy i don't know i think he is are you all is this guy asking to have them as guests
monday matt and adam conover i can't imagine why monday matt be guesting on efap later
what format do you think but what what what environment uh scenario do you think he'd come
on efap for adam conover no monday matt what would i have him come on for like i was trying to say
like what reason would he come up to efap before i'd be like i don't know oh just some some little
some just some pathetic attempt at clawing his way back up into good graces but he'd fuck i was
gonna say like i can't even imagine picking his brain on anything like it would just be a strange
experience uh yes shadowverse team makes great points definitely yes uh damn i work tomorrow hope
y'all are still live then well uh it'll be up on moolah as soon as at least uh i hate him so much
not even the dom will be able to pull me off this mewling soy guzzler once i chimp out and start
going under bunker on him okay i take it back you've been very creative ron uh the bible is a sword
like weapon that's that's that's like your opinion one of the things that annoys me is that the big
laser in tlj is referred to as miniaturized death star tech then it's just a big heat laser
it is nothing like the death star laser did they not watch the ot no they probably actually didn't
no i i don't actually think that they did because let me turn off my ac if i if i reference death
star to uh a lot of people who haven't seen the ot in more than a decade even they probably still
know what it is but they also if if i showed like a consistent laser firing at a wall and said uh
that's made of death star stuff they probably like like oh yeah it's a red laser it's the same thing
right yeah and it's a laser go boom that's interesting though because i don't even think
i brought that up in my tlj stuff that yeah it's strange to call it death star tech when it doesn't
operate at all like a death star but i suppose they literally just mean laser look laser that
one's a laser that one's a laser okay um hi dog wizard dog wizard ooh take the title
world hello i wasn't quite ready for this but i mean you know oh i oh i'm a wizard rags
you're a wizard doggo australia equals the deep fake continent created by the cia
you ever seen australia and reality in the same room i haven't
bad people like man it ism manachinism people like manachinism it's easier to make enemies out of
people you disagree with than to try and see their perspectives and argue properly well they certainly
can't argue like these people are never really able to articulate their points very well
smaller thoughts on doomcock's report about captain marvel mcu was my childhood but watching it
start to burn after going sjw does put a smile on my face so all i know about this is that
doomcock a source from doomcock has said that disney are now very concerned about the the
the potential of captain marvel when she has no spider-man to help get her to be more likable
spider-man being booted is making them worry that captain marvel maybe isn't this and focus on or
something like that i think that's what his source said um and the mcu are not sure what they're
doing right now with captain marvel they're not to me i'd just be like oh they finally realized
that that is the case it's not a matter of whether or not you think that's the case that
is the case she's a disaster of a character so good luck with that again i'll be curious to
see how they deal with her they try and make more movies for her how they try and make her a leader
it's gonna i say that even though i like yeah i i think that she is just the harbinger of
terrible things to come uh get craig neon and geeky sparkles from clownfish tv on efap
i think people mentioned clownfish tv before um again we're on board with most guests we'll just
have to get around the name is familiar yeah i was gonna say i'm not familiar with their work but
hello if by men you mean insecure man babies then yeah um he did seem to want to specify
that whenever he said man he was talking about a specific set of people he spoke to that
seemed to be from what he even referred to himself as troll accounts i found that interesting when
you said yeah so that he was pretty he was like maybe not yeah he was he was pretty yeah he was
he pretty much said oh yeah a lot of them are troll accounts i was like oh so you know that
a lot of them are troll accounts so why do you even you know it's just one of those things where
you just like oh this is just you well that was like three times in that he said something and
i'm like oh you just said but but okay i'm just going by what you say mate i'm just i'm just
listening to your words i'm just i'm just listening i think i think he acknowledged that as well because
he said at the end it's like you were holding my feet to the fire with like the quote we're just
because remember when he was like have you got a quote of me saying this thing at one point and
i was just like oh man he seems so defeated he was like have i said this stupid thing
yeah it's like is this are you guys talking about another tweet that i said it's like
it doesn't matter at this point just defend it or just agree with it or disagree with it and
i mean just you know sometimes it's okay to just in the moment even in even the start
thing right should they do it he didn't even he gave the most pathetic answer to it it's like
whoever makes money they should he had a couple of meandering answers and there were people in
chat being like you need to stop him from doing it and it's like you have to there is a certain
amount of etiquette sometimes where we can't do that every single time every time he tries to
speak and he immediately starts off with like we've got a different direction and i stopped him
once said like wait i know where this is going he's like no no no we'll see like yep it went
exactly where i thought it was going to go and now we got to re-ask the question again yeah
and he didn't even really answer it if we're gonna have people on to talk about their perspective
we're gonna have to let him talk even if the answer isn't anything like what we were looking
for sometimes and then after his answer we can be like as i did like three times like
answer the question and all that yeah and i think i think we did try point that out a
bunch of times we're just like this is a strange way to avoid the question didn't really answer
the question there um but he did come on i do want to uh maintain that that was that was pretty
awesome of him to do because it won't and i want to encourage that more discussion good
ignore him not bad if people are being very timid and non-committal in a lot of their answers
you can't just go full blast on them they just won't know they just won't know how to
fucking deal with it and they'll leave and then it isn't going to help
i mean some sometimes you got to read the room you know
um aussies are the texans of brits but weaker i've heard that said before
the aussies are the texans of texans of brits iron man three better than monday and matt
i agree okay why would that have been a thing that why did monday back up up twice did we
why did he come up why did he just get pulled up out of where um what do you guys think about
the netflix show disenchantment i watched one episode and i didn't like it so i didn't continue
it i'm a huge fan of og simpsons and futurama so i was like disenchantment also uh cj has a
video on disenchantment and funnily enough it was one of the first videos i watched from him
and i was like ooh what he said uh he says something in the video like i'm going to try
and explain the objective flaws of this show i was like oh shit molly you're definitely on
all the lists by now so please make plans to flee the eurokirk union before they abduct you
and throw you into the gulag i'll be hopefully you'll be out eventually yeah i mean one of these
will be free they won't be able to put me in a gulag if if we're all independent and stuff right
right gulag yeah you just go straight to the uk gulags because you've made a bad tweet
but at least they'll be uk gulags not eu gulags i am making a functioning efap monopoly when the
card game is done ooh interesting we can play that oh but if it's like a live like if it's a
physical thing how do we do that i guess now if you if you were to give us if you were to give us
like an overlay that we could put over the actual game maybe and let us have free control of the
pieces then we could pretty much do whatever rules we wanted you like if we all had control over
everything yeah like um like if we were just able to move pieces around and we could control the
numbers in our bank account then we could we could play the game with whatever rules we wanted
yeah i think so i'm not sure how that would work exactly because i assume
the tabletop simulator game is capable of being modded right have your own game not sure um yeah
we could do that uh yay efap having a tumbler of rhino milk whilst working late after a long
afternoon of playing dead cells also hi mauler hello that's two thirty it's late it's 8 28 a.m
for me now oh no uh yay efap having a tumbler away i read that one already also hi mauler hello
shad give us some essay four detail oh is that the um well i'll just i'll save it so
can answer that himself whatever way he wishes um leaf here do you euro fags wish you had guns
like rags what's your favorite oh well i guess i'm the only person who can answer that now yeah
what's your favorite well i mean i can still have a favorite even if i can't use any of them
going strictly from like my knowledge from video games will probably be um i don't know
though i don't think i do have a favorite i like the like six shooter revolver style things they
just they have a cool factor yeah yeah very superficial reason um like
guns from games that i gravitate to whenever i play like uh fps games i typically revolve
towards rifles um i don't think that means and um do i wish we had guns i mean if i had like a
some form of a guarantee that it would improve things sure i don't think the um is i like because
i'm pretty much of the perspective that uh banning all guns everywhere is probably not going to solve
crazy murderers but like are you asking if if would i be would i do i think that like britain
should be able to legalize it and stuff would be like be interesting probably should be a slow a
slow process because just suddenly introducing you know that kind of thing might have you know
bad repercussions so uh i got my armor light 15 today do you know what that is don't i do
well ar stands for armor light rifle so he's prior referring to an ar-15
uh which case uh fine fine guns i've got two and i probably will end up with more
rags is based i miss wolf mde never dies mde
i mean that's not to do with guns
mde
uh i don't know
oh what what was the con say that one more time well it says rags is based i miss wolf mde never
dies mde never dies uh i'll keep an eye on chat see if anyone that would line up with it
blip said million dollar extreme million dollar million dollar extreme
i don't know what that is either i don't know what i don't know what that means yeah um anyway
i love that i have more efap to watch but hate that i have more to catch up on because i'm back
at 48 you massive long man you're also an orphan i thank you i appreciate that that bone density
related um there was some people posted on the subreddit like um like i'm a new fan of efap do i
have to watch all the episodes to get the new ones and i can't believe we've made something that
that's a question like people like do i need to watch the older seasons in order to understand
the character development the new seasons that sort of thing uh yeah there's people who are like
trying to point out the episodes that have the most significant meme developments i think or
just ones the fun of shit happens i hope you're enjoying it uh doing a meme vid can you say
i am mauler in a very dramatic way you're looking for like the iron man one
assuming it's going to be when he snaps he does the whole breath thing she's like i am iron man
um do you see that they recorded that you can't use that you can't use that because you said iron
man instead of mauler oh i wasn't actually doing my one yet all right yeah that's right yeah
like there's a video where he does multiple takes of that it's like also that it came the like a
extra filming shit like that wasn't originally in the script and it's funny because of how it
seems like it obviously would have been like you know that the original was he says i am inevitable
and then he just snaps wow that seems like really a slot for yeah and like um i think it was their
sound designer or somebody who suggested they should have him say i am i am i how did that not
oh of course that's better yes it's just like that seems perfect oh man um jack saint tried to boot
rags off efap but since joe is from aj the easier to keep him on during a potential debate that
happened is that the origins of uh j being manager because i we would have never had me not beyond
that's the thing like it was never it was never going to happen the idea that you could just
kick off one of the posts is yeah it's not happening that wasn't ever going to be a thing
that ever happened yeah and not to mention we were like there's not even you know like say for example
if you had like a really awkward or back and forth history with like loads of bad blood it would be
like oh there's something to discuss there but literally no reason they were just like oh
toy rugs like you have to do yeah they were just like it we you know we know why they won't but
there was no way that we yeah it's just come on um i guess i should say i am mauler even though
that sounds kind of really gay but like in a good way like objectively gay you know
it's like rags aside yeah i'm i'm how did i give that a moment to
kind of process and i think that yeah i think it works i think you're good i think i don't
this should be a keeper i should be a keeper yeah it's for metal damn my dyslexatism oh yeah
yeah did you get hooked up with a bonsai
saves that for him bonsai is a type of weapon right
a bonsai it's kind of tree yeah but um is the name given to a
the kind of or am i thinking or is he actually getting a tree
i all i know is that i just know that bonsai is a it's a little tree and you could trim them and
they're supposed to be all you get all feng shui with your bonsai bushes you know does it help
keep a people mind i think it's supposed to be something like that something about
i don't know maybe it's just calming and everything fits together and everything
has its place and it's feng shui
as people who've expressed as people who have experienced discussing criticizing and explaining
various topics what would you say are the most important things to focus on when making those
kinds of videos say one more time just so i gather it all as people who have experienced discussing
criticizing and explaining various topics what would you say are the most important things to
to focus on when making those kinds of videos i just say make sure that you're not contradictory
and make sure that your logic when driven to its natural conclusions kind of checks out
just always be yeah i guess just be just be consistent just have good valid arguments and
clearly you know clear structures to the things that you're saying
accurate don't be ambiguous or necessarily yeah yes well they'll lead you to a good place to be
and as you're as you're saying it out loud as you're doing all that stuff
you know try to poke holes into it always try to do like a always have a little devil's advocate
in your head you know this says goodbye rags oh goodbye happy rhino day your massives happy
rhino day happy rhino day hey fringle i really like your brown table video i'm sure he would
appreciate um i think the helicopter lightsaber is a lot more we've seen that one from um
thing is it rebels it's either rebels or the clomals i think it's rebels but
they have like a circle sort of device lightsaber comes out of each end of it and it can spin around
and let them fly oh my god are you fucking with me it's pretty silly and i'd love it if they like
they put into episode nine how does it how does it provide lift
the force how do you like you can't just spin four things and expect it to zoom upwards
um i don't know if someone in chat might have a like a law answer or if it's absolute
rubbish like are like is are the are the blades of the lightsaber like tilted like fans so they
can provide lift upwards where does the power come from i just so many that's so fucking stupid
that's like a joke that's like a joke somebody would do that's like a star wars parody thing
i feel bad that you didn't know about that because that's been around for a long time now
and uh it's just so silly
well this is the thing it's in rebels that a lot of people do not like rebels
i haven't seen rebels so it's just like out of my mind i don't know anything about rebels
yeah i i know i'm i'm not everybody's just saying it's actually rubbish so yeah it's actually
rubbish well i'm glad we have confirmation we've got confirmation as a female fan i despise new
star wars but okay i guess i don't count to this guy because i'm not the right kind of woman
apparently he didn't speak to um i guess not those women or at least they were much more reasonable
um partly a joke equals close to infinity well someone else said that rebels as time travel
cannon yeah i saw that thing from rebels where they're like time travel and like whoa whoa whoa
let's uh let's tap the brakes there uh maybe slow this uh slow this crazy train down for a
so archangel said partly a joke is is equal to close to infinity the reason why i wouldn't
agree with that is because let's say a friend of yours is uh getting a little drunk maybe a bit too
much and you go hey man cubbed out a little bit and then they're like like whoa dude like where
are you coming from with this and she's like okay i was just sort of kidding just take it easy
like um the idea that you can say something and you've seen it from a place where it's like coming
from a sort of serious place but you also are okay with it coming across as like a fight criticism
you're partly joking like close to infinity makes no sense but partly a joke i can see that being
applicable in certain scenarios when you say like if i say an action rags is committing is wrong
and then i go i was partly joking like so were you saying it's wrong or not
like it doesn't make sense but um i didn't partly joke about other things i think it's in scenario
i knew i wasn't the only one who heard it in its two angel of the morning playing also your
sorry i i knew i wasn't the only one who heard it it oh it right you capitalize it i'd be able
to recognize i got totally confused um in it too yeah they play angel of the morning for like two
seconds as well um saying also you're joking on the women superiority thing right i am not 100%
on which fine but it sounded ridiculous then probably yeah hi rags hello and also mauler
hello also boo uh i would like to say yukas not that bad all right cool two dollars for you
massives thanks for the vids no problemo uh rags would you mind saying for a meme i'm on a
pilgrimage and biggidius trail interesting phrase i need to say i'm on a pilgrimage
i'm on a pilgrimage and what is the what is the second one biggidius trail
the giddius trail the giddius trail i guess i guess i got to think of the context in which we
would say is it like you're reading a trail maybe but maybe i look at the sign and you're like oh
biggidius trail
hola thanks for all you do by the way chap member when eps team died in uh fed custody right before
testifying about an international pedo blackmail ring run by mas alzard and then kevin spacey's
accused of randomly died too haha he he poo poo i think he's saying that the conspiracy around
things seem very odd in relation to all that do they not um well that's uh where some shenanigans
going on at mauler while your season eight episode three rage was definitely unbridled
episode four was bridled episode five was certainly thoughtfully considered i love them all
yeah i guess progression became the longer something takes the more the less emotional i
suppose it becomes because yeah i think people see the episode three rage that i did is i'm more
angry than i am with tlj almost it's interesting uh that works i know but i was definitely pissed
off in the um what they did with gamathrone i love them all best wishes to wolf and hi rags hello
uh good job shad on asking brandon about tlj save that
so
i now have six things for rad as shad to hear about
did you just all right rags fill me full of your hunk spunk
hunk spunk make me tight as a tick a human water skin of doggo come wow oh man
hi dale your video sucked but hopefully you're a good dude
uh suspicious on whether this is actually dale i think it was i think it was dale but i could get
being suspicious at the beginning i i actually was when he had like this really terrible microphone
i was like uh oh did i just add some random person called dale but uh yeah he seemed to recognize
most of everything um i want rags robot head and doomcock real voice to narrate my life
i'll give you that out get them to record a bazillion phrases and then put them into some kind
of ai did it with jordan peterson right and then he took a shit
he decided to have himself a wank before bed it went well but you'd have variants like this one
probably not the best idea he would have to wank harder to get any results yeah that's like kind
of like a cheat guide you listen to your the person narrating your life like tips and then
you get really worried when he says something like he was not prepared for what would happen next
you're like oh shit what is it did he know this would be one of the memorable wanks of his life
then it turns out for really bad reasons yeah he ripped his dick
no oh no dale's new video men are ruining microphones
didn't get it fixed so maybe men are fixing yeah we're also the ones building him so i think we
have a bit of a
oh boo hoo they're being mean to the holes the holes
oh are you talking about women ras referring to women
wow man men did ruin star wars their names jj and ryan oh shit get fox scrub stupid holes
either get into the slave layer costume or get out of my star wars laugh my ass off okay okay
hey shad what's better at deflecting this guy or a good old-fashioned shield
that's not bad like it's funny yeah it's deflecting hashtag never believe women what the
all right rah dale what would you tell the women who dislike disney star wars
more particularly tlj i feel like i'm being preached to in these new movies
i think if you were here he would have said
they're absolutely allowed to dislike them but even tlj for whatever reasons they have
this is uh i was trying to say like that's why i didn't want to bring on that star wars girl to
have her like make several arguments against tlj just to have him be like that's fair that's okay
i appreciate that like if he had maintained that women enjoy star wars or something
uh it maybe would have been a better idea but he didn't he didn't seem to be the guy in that video
um i'm a long way since then perhaps maybe dale you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards
rags what high-end mouse do you recommend g600 well i don't know i don't that's the thing i don't
know if i'd call it high-end because it's only like 35 bucks or so but that's the one i'm using
right now and i've got a i got a spare just in case and i really like him maula if disney offered
you five million dollars to give episode nine a glowing review would you take it no and now you
might be like really why not that would like set you for life as well as many of your friends and
family i'd be like uh probably but um the the way it would work it's like i'd have to completely
ruin integrity wise because i'm assuming the whole point of this question i would have to be doing
it in a very unironic way so making that video would be a nightmare because i'd have to like
assuming that the the film isn't very good and then to like defend that position and it would
totally kill my channel because i would have to make so many bad arguments i'd probably kill a
lot of my relationships so yeah i just uh and i wouldn't be comfortable with myself and you'd be
like why did you do it for money it's like yeah if someone i know isn't under life essential cancer
treatment it'd be a pretty tough sell yeah i was gonna say they might be an exception to make the
only thing that could convince me is if you were like 100 like this money is clean cut provided no
taxes and it's it's legal and that you can filter it out to all these different people
care about yeah can i do anything i want with it it's like because ultimately like you could do a
lot of good but i might even make a video after that would be like i did it for these reasons
you know but like i'm assuming there would be a stipulation i wouldn't be able to do that i don't
know interesting question though i survived movie bob quinton jack saint eric taxon patrick willams
massive anderson brown table yet this dude makes me tap out for the night
can someone edit brown table's face on homelander's body because he literally said that he would
eye laser people to death over perceived slights could easily make that meme video especially
with certain scenes from uh just when i think i can't stand rags his anecdotes about gay sex
anymore he goes unga-bunga on intellectually slippery guests and brutally knives them with
the quickest sharpest arguments based that's from ra apparently he likes he likes what you did in
the debate well i and i i thought i heard that i was being too soft but i'm i'm glad some some
people you just gotta some people you yeah i mean i i think we all kind of were but it's probably
because you know it's because of his disposition i think you could actually hear it in a lot of
the ways we were saying things that b u and shad started to back off a little bit because it was
kind of like i didn't feel bad you know which i shouldn't have to feel bad for like a grown man
in a discord call but you know it was like especially compared to like some of the other
debates we've had on this channel it's a bit different um anyway become what you must become
the warrior of longness uh or that's referencing um one sec
okay well while you're gone chat and i will just uh we got rags equals dennis reynolds i don't know
who that is i hope it's nice person i hope he's handsome he's got a big ass dick
let's see we got okay i will order that then thanks rags oh yeah i really like the g600 one
thing that's great about it is i really like the 12 buttons on the side very very helpful in games
but it also has that third mouse click button on the top for your ring finger
that has spoiled me and it will spoil you too that shit has come in handy it's just so useful
the whole thing is useful this mouse has spoiled me for other mice so i would absolutely recommend
the g600 love it saying i was brought to the gulag where were you well we uh rags what is
the hour on your end it is uh 250 am and i have i woke up and i was in a car ride driving home
and once i got home i pretty much hopped on efap so i'm hungry uh
he'll probably leave by the time you read this but please tell shad that just like theo he's based
and god bless his fam and the shadlets on your mate shadlets sure he appreciates the shiglet the
shiglets um at molar have you seen the loved ones check your discord for the link please watch with
wolf and rags i think you'll love it it's it's terrifying properties uh is it a tv show that's
got terrifying properties is it a food has terrifying properties what about that
man i'm not sure an eye for the eye an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind
no it doesn't because there's gonna be one guy left with one eye because that's true have an
eye to be able to poke out the last other eye very true have you seen second seven psychopaths
i have not seen seven psychopaths that uh i saw jurassic park though what i just said is actually
it's very funny anyway uh rhett them fight that is a reference to god jira rhett them fight you
don't get to vilify a whole group and chicken out when people directly confront the base of
your argument be a man you wimp kind of i wish to be incendiary i believe yeah i said it to be
incendiary and it wasn't true and i don't mean it but i it's like really you don't mean it because
your whole video implied that you kind of did just kind of just sort of kind of
happy birthday shad so glad you're not dead but would have been interesting to see the rise of
shadlings to seek revenge on spooter man spooter how do you not watch always sunny rags i just
don't watch a lot of things i'd rather play games than watch shows this is the most embarrassed
i've ever been for another person dear aliens who want to help us evolve i am sorry hashtag not my
dale not my dale um i came here from rk outpost you're cool to watch rk outpost
i don't know is that a content creator or a channel or a website i i really don't i've been
catching up on previous efap episodes and visiting the efap website i have come to the conclusion
that rags is the best guest mahalo to loa oh there you go rags last guest oh i'm the best
guest and we've had many great guests to be the apex guest is uh i like it i like it
shad slash fringy when will granola riots to electric boogaloo happen
we'll save that question i don't know if it's serious or a meme but either way
a nice chunky stream always satisfying to hear good hail maula shout out my channel please
the dire wolf tv has what looks to be a ball for a head with one of them
graduation caps on the top of it dire wolf tv re what you said about going into the lion's den
and arguing many people at once i think the reason that people you cover genuinely don't like that
is because they're usually people who don't argue with points but rely on feels sophistry crowd
appeasement etc that's the framework discourse whatever in which they operate and in that
framework strength always lies in numbers not arguments i actually think that's a pretty good
point and that's from ra by the way like uh when you have 10 people saying something that's not
substantiated it doesn't matter because 10 people have said it's cool yeah and once and once you
i mean if you formulate your your whole stance your whole argument your whole point
on you know feelings and things like that once someone says i don't care
it's like what do you have you just you're done
um interview with Amelia clark at the emmys guy asked how she felt about the
baccala she said it was flattering how much the fans care about how the characters should
have behaved based on previous seasons it's a nice thing to say she um i know for a fact
that she doesn't want to say something along the lines of the fans need to calm down all
the fans because of the fact that here uh she was over the moon with how free folk the subreddit
set up a load of donations to her charity um because they they wanted something good to come
out of the fact that season eight was such a disaster and i think she was aware of that
connection and so she's probably like these aren't bad people they just got something
fucking nightmare for them to watch so um and i know for a fact that she didn't think that what
happened to taderius was good so yeah we know she was she was drinking and everything i don't
blame her at all i mean the same way i'm like this is the person that i've spent this with this is
what happened what what just like this that was quick um yeah if there's a clip for uh for that
i'll probably see it eventually it'll make the rounds if it's something significant but if not
it's about space wizards for women you get to look at for the ultimate piece of media
um please upload this later i only just woke up absolutely we haven't
covered anything that's copyrightable so this will absolutely be going
efap in your house bitch you hear that shit you punk ass essayists are going down like way down
dead down so down you ain't gonna know which way is up your ass is gonna be crying to your skank
ass queen oh planky don't let the long man review us fuck you we're gonna review your planky ass whoo
whoo view your planky ass it is rather planky
game of thrones won best drama because of the drama from backlash not the actual show
that's fair
also it's a bit silly to criticize dr strange a movie for dr wizards
yes it's a silly movie for dr wizards with dr wizards y'all forget spider-man coming out is
an efap meme oh i mean that's one of the most commonly mentioned memes i don't think we would
have forgotten if it sounded like we took it seriously we were probably in on a an in-depth
meme incredible hulk is the most underrated mcu movie um i don't know man i because i did
rewatch it for the mcu and that movie is the height of meh kind of like thought to
you maybe our massives people there are kind of people the massive kind
get some rest you lovely lads oh soon soon sir soon mola what yeah hopefully soon
what project are you currently working on so i have created six videos for e for for
for the moolah channel two of them came out one of them was i think me frags and frags wow
beef fringy and wolf looking at three trailers and uh the highlights of metal stream
we still got me rags and fringy checking out the lady in the tramp trailer
then i've got the debate between me and wolf and just right the debate between me and wolf and that
guy i forget his name the efap movies for doom efap movies for fellowship of the ring and i'm
still needing to edit the next two and there's another one that is supposed to get partially
secret i don't know if he wants it to be a secret but it's to do with jay um but i've edited up my
side of it he needs to just do something on releasing a video but it's it's a moolah reaction
mini thing rags probably knows what i'm talking about next even sex demon you know oh i love sex
demon alien um i don't think i don't think jay actually wants it to be a secret i'm just gonna
be careful to make sure i don't say if he wanted it to be anyway i've just been making all of them
and there's a couple more i want to make um once they're done i'm gonna get started on my next
big project so i need like another week or two but um they'll be coming out
every wednesday i think until they're all out and it's just more supplementary content for efap
and it's amazing you'll love it yeah i was i'm really happy with how the fellowship of the ring
of movies turned out it's i'm hoping you guys will find it i was just oh man i love the rewatching it
and the doom one just just thinking about them both is oh they're that stuff is gold um and yeah
the uh the debates the me and wolf were in they i've edited them up i've cut out as much like
silence and awkward double takes as much as i could just to make it more streamlined there were
a few silences i had to keep though because they're part of jokes or wolf singing songs where
things happen and um i don't know it's just that i think i think i managed to cut about
20 plus minutes from both of them and it was just adding like to consider about but yeah
they'll just be available through moolah now um yes i'm excited to get all that stuff out
it'll happen over the next few weeks went to sleep 30 minutes before stream glad to see ending
yes when you do there uh rambo last blood was a let down story wise just letting y'all know
well oh no not the story i was gonna say rambo i only remember watching rambo for just
the action so hopefully uh hopefully that's all intact tfa critique three when
what was it next year august i believe
he he does have an element of spider within him so it's good to take that seriously
oh important to note right one of our problems with godzilla king of the monsters
was that the story was shit but the fights were good we wanted the fights were like seven minutes
of the whole movie yeah yeah we didn't necessarily realize that until re-watching it the fights was
so little of king of the monsters holy shit um i think you have to get 41 minutes in for the first
fight and there's there's barely any actual fighting so really quick with rambo if you're
like oh oh so maybe you like rambo if we like rambo you thought the action was good but it was
but the story was shit you said the same thing about godzilla i think there will probably be
more than like 10 minutes of actual action and fighting in rambo very guaranteed that
the human shit in rambo is probably a lot better than the human shit in king of the monsters
yeah because the human shit in king of the monsters was like terrible awful the fact that
they had to create a character that was pro end of the world and then suddenly not it's like oh okay
they're gonna save the world damn it anyway also high and buy rags bye
rambo was mayor hoped for logan but i got hostile
i think you're saying it's going to be very gory well the last one was
yeah i remember rambo there's four rambos right currently well there's five now
um
i think there's this the fifth one that's coming out i don't know
oh someone in charge said rambo five was two thoughts so this is rambo six
i don't know honestly i guess i'll find out from chat um i still believe mozzarella sticks
with sauce is pizza i don't see how that would be true at all
i have either of you played papers please yes i haven't um i found it a lot of fun it's a really
cool game for how small it is and am i crazy or did they intend to make a movie about it i
remember watching like a trailer five this is rambo five okay so this is the one that's come
out now is rambo i thought i was because i remember watching four of them you never know
um hi rags hello of the new video are either of you familiar with the youtuber donut operator
yeah i am i've seen him on twitter i don't know much else
what do you know about donut operator rags like a police kind of guy reviews police footage a lot
of the times things like that arrests and criminal stuff since hollywood i like him since hollywood
is dropping the ball on movies i thought there would be a rise of internet interest in independent
movies separated from film festival garbage or maybe everyone just moved to youtube and streaming
shows i don't think anyone's gonna hate mainstream movies so much that they'll never watch mainstream
movies again because you never know it's always like a roll of the dice every time that we're
like oh will this one be good hope it will we hope it will because nothing's standing in their way
technically they could bring out a good movie like lord of the rings is mainstream fucking amazing
well it's like the normally you'd think that obviously the professionals would be really good
at what they do let's like when you go to when you compare an nfl professional football game
to like you know like a little league game or a bunch of children playing the game obviously
the professionals will be really good at it but when you talk about film man the professionals
are do a really shit job so much a breakfast now i returned good morning everyone good morning
yeah morning the longer the efap the greater the tism bilbus
my name is hitori bocce my favorite food is natto on rice i prefer my natto finally crushed save
the mustard that comes with it so it's not wasted okay that's fair enough yeah that's fair enough
man i don't know what any of that meant but it seems like you got a plan
in a man with a plan where are that daddy very happy not sure if that's referencing something
or if it's strange super either way just a strange super hello you too i'm a trans woman here even
though i have the perfect profile to be an sjw i think the sequel are terrible keep up the good
content i love it thank you we shall do it we will make sure that the good content flows like beer
in a place where beer flows a lot yes it will continue to flow like the spice
when i heard you guys weren't starting until six here i joked about prepping for efap to end at 2am
it's almost three expectations subverted i didn't know you guys were starting as late as you did
well yeah uh it was because of them being australian uh we were originally gonna have
just fringy and then i uh i asked if shad was available because i thought he'd be interested
in the um and then i was like wait if we've got two of the australians then we're gonna be in
prime time to have a theater well other australians i was like we can try robot head the triple threat
but yeah we can't necessarily run an efap at normal time and have australian guests because
it's like the worst time ever for them at that point you know they're terrible people is what
i'm trying to say they're on prison time they only they only get so many so many hours out in the yard
to frickin' ask after eight hours i just don't have the stamina to keep efapping mauler and rags
this is for both of you as thanks for watching tlj i found you both while looking for the answer to
why keep up the great content thank you very much you bet glad you found what you were looking
for i suppose i think that's the implication ate all the welts rags did you ever get your monthly
thrust i'm still waiting on mine also hi mauler hello i don't believe i got my monthly thrust
and i'm a very disappointed doggo going to bed thanks for the stream stay based ra
oh well you got a fan right mauler thoughts on attack on titan and it's exceptionally good
writing i've not watched it i'm afraid it looks neat haven't really either
thoughts on finn declaring he's rebels come in lj i didn't understand because i thought they
were the resistance it's only like they they swap between saying rebels and resistance a couple of
times yeah they're kind of interchangeable well it's because they're just trying to exactly
recreate the rebels so yeah i attempted to explain to a friend who thinks tlj is good that you can
measure that using you can measure that using objectivity claims it's a pointless exercise
since when whatever standard we use wouldn't be his some are too far gone also hi rags hello
and yeah like you don't want to there are some relationships that are not with
going into the philosophical side of how you judge art if you don't want to
you could just leave it alone like and plus he doesn't have to agree to the standard
question can rags play akbar's theme
i think we all know the answer to that also hi baller hello in the eu ig88 was programmed
with super advanced ai and almost led a droid rebellion uploaded himself into the second death
star and conquered the galaxy really i had no idea okay when did that happen uh the only thing
in chernobyl i'd call bad with certain conversations that felt goofy in episode
two the scene in the helicopter felt like the dark knight rises i like the helicopter scene you
talking about the woman i like that scene he he explains how a nuclear reactor works i don't
know again that was that wasn't just for the guy on the helicopter i thought it was kind of clever
that was for juke and plus it shows like it shows a lot about the character of um i forget his name
uh but basically the um yeah the politician guy it says a lot about you know how he tackles
problems oh yeah i thought he was great in that show stellan's cast oh i really liked it
you know he's um he's he's will turn his dad in the arts the caribbean film
oh it's been so long since i've seen those movies yeah i didn't even think about it
uh if you had the choice to either fix season eight of game of thrones or fix the sequel trilogy
um ensuring great quality which would you pick probably star wars
i i know it's honestly a tough choice but the reason i'm kind of aiming almost
partially altruistic here in the i know it would mean more to the world if star wars was
what we wanted it to be the the the continuation of the ot imagine like a perfect new trilogy
bad to make people go nuts and we still always got the books for game of thrones at least um yeah
they're coming out right one day would you rather make out with a predator or an alien predator
the predator seems to it seems like it that's that's what it's for i don't know just saying
i mean yeah predator i mean plus the alien with the second mouth and everything is just
uh i'm totally into to strong babes you know i'm the one who criticized shadow visti's
verbosity and i get that you like him and want to give him free rein to say whatever
but i think there's a line he crosses your audience is more interested in hearing you
and rags go on at length southpaw has the same problem be aware you're a guest
um i don't i don't know that i would agree with that the uh when when shad comes on i'd say that
a vast majority of the audience seem to be very invested in uh his takes as i think is there
because he's very informed on a lot of the subjects yeah i think that people i like i
like listening to what you say i mean he's not he's not like a bad guest normally when
he talks about stuff there's a point to it or he's trying to express an idea of some kind and
he's certainly not wasting air time yeah like being genuine now i actually don't feel like
he overspoke really at all even um i think he even did a couple times like when oh you know
you go first sort of thing with some people um i think i think he gets the etiquette
honestly that's that's just my take yeah i wouldn't have even thought about it uh holy
shit you guys are still going i should expect nothing less from the long man and the great
doggo also hi rags hello oh yeah we going we're going and going this crazy train ain't got no
breaks did disney copyright the last efap they did and uh they've monetized it which is fine
because they allowed it to be viewed uh worldwide which is all i wanted they blocked it at first
this is the funny thing the two strikes the hit on it said that we monetize it and we block it i
was like okay what if what you go the monetize part's pretty pointless you've played yourself
and they were like once you appeal it they're like okay fine it's available but uh we monetize it and
it's funny because it's like nine hours or whatever and they're monetizing literally like
a 10 second straight part and it's like yeah you guys you really need that ad sense right there
the whole thing belongs to you because of that moment and it's a meme video that's the funny
part like it's literally a fucking parody mash-up it's got nothing to do whatever it's fine and
the other funny part by the way is that it's about endgame we were defending that film in that stream
go ahead go ahead disney take it take it away take you take your fucking money
uh great show guys hope you like the site overhaul oh yeah that's uh that's kibbitkins again efap.me
is uh ad update again it's looking wanky most impressive yeah um is a section for uh
people we've covered now and uh they've got how many videos we've covered in which efaps they were
covered in the amount of statistics developing on efap.me isn't like statistics you didn't even
know you wanted you got them so swanky but um if i tweet you a video of my doggo will you play it
on efap for the cuteness well we prefer i mean if it was a youtube video and it was short i'd
consider it in the meme section fit i'd consider it but the thing is if i ever actually agreed to
this fully then i could start getting spammed with videos like that so thinking about it i'd
probably say no because i don't have to care like it's not like efap meme related um uh greetings
from the russian essay community my long man's you two not speaking my language helps me sleep
without fear wow this has gone long hi rags hello rags king of the massives hello king of the
masses that is true though you two watched hardcore henry if so thoughts i have not i haven't watched it
now rewatch lord of the rings cries so much at the end 15 minutes no it's quite the nice uh
resolution epilogue always gets me always gets me i meant fin says he's rebel scum yeah yeah yeah i
uh he says it uh after he's beaten down phasma right um because she says
does she say you're like something rebel that he's like rebel scum i can't even remember the
context that he walks my brain is melting and i haven't seen tlj now in possibly over a year or
nearly a year i haven't seen it in ages so long it feels weird actually like yeah we talked about
it so much but we haven't seen it in so long um but yeah it's it's a cringe line there's loads
of fucking cringe dialogue throughout uh your mama um rags bedtime was like three hours ago how
would you from tx yeah it was right yeah tx is texas and it was that long ago um how much are you
guys thinking of charging dale for that therapy session seems you walked him through a lot of
issues dr molar and nurse rags i uh i don't know if we've we would have changed his mind
at anything he seemed to be against himself already to begin with right like that i think
that responded to that video if he went into another call with some other people who are
arguing from us i think he would have had the exact same stuff to say i think he would have
just kind of subtly folded in a different direction probably it wasn't um
i don't think it was like like a huge moment for him coming on here
going to be like uh yeah i'm gonna have to deal with these things that i said that that while ago
i guess yeah the highlight for me was just the
telly i'm like you would never say this thing right he was like no but then like oh i did
it's like whoops um it happens um and yeah that was uh the last super chest i just got a couple
me real quick all right
fully reviewing a movie about space wizards for children
oh yeah there's a i was made aware there's a stretch goal
for uh oh well i guess a goal on patreon i think for patrick willams where once he'd
reached a goal he's gonna have his parents see avengers end game like that was patreon goal i
thought that was really strange that is an odd one like okay whatever floats your boat that's
and we got this you're from upside down land well from my point of view you're upside down land
well then you are lost
a few more updated wizard takes of course
milk wizard and the geode wizard there's gonna be a whole family of wizards
these are really cute these drawings are really cute yeah they are they got loads of characters
yeah i really like them the fucking carton of milk with a rhino on it it's like that's
like the symbol the the the dog whistle of efap you're like that's efap right right
if you hate star wars you just hate yourself
ismond froydian mentor of biggideous like his eyes
if you hate star wars you just hate yourself that's insane
it's like oh yeah definitely that you've solved it i just hate myself
in the beginning is just the prelude to the extended middle of froydian the elder
froydian
uh yeah don't panic there are obviously more memes from today i don't think i've
gotten to every one of them from different sources the annoying thing for me though is
they don't just come through twitter and i'm trying to keep care of everything um
but we'll we'll try and maybe do a meme section next ish time uh guest five just said it's only
the middle it's it is technically but now i'm gonna bring it in to the end um thank you all
for watching this 10 hour efap for some reason the efaps keep going really long now and we didn't
even cover the other video that was set to be today and i thought it was gonna be a short efap
because of that you say that you say that every time and it just never it never is but like where
is that it seems like that's gonna be that i didn't think that we would have so much to talk
about with this guy's video i didn't think that was gonna happen i thought he was it blew my mind
but oh mauler you and you and your thoughts i am a naive man your efaps are only an attempt
to disguise the fact that you hate yourself i'm so sorry um no everyone donate to keep
read it out and so yes thank you all for watching thank you very much for the
kind donations the wonderful memes and artwork and the um well first of course wonderful guests
in for their respective moments and times the links are all in the description for the different
things we talked about today on the different channels and um
please say both you dumbos need to watch hardcore henry i'll probably watch it one day i'm sure i'm
sure the next 24 hour efap will be an accident i don't think we'll ever accidentally do a 24
hour yeah i think that i think i think at one point during a potential accidental 24 hour
efap will oh fuck i need to i need to like maintain bodily functions survival is kicking
in i need to do other things i need to eat drink sleep because i i seriously do have to sleep like
i've been i was away out of town when i woke up this morning and i we drove back and once i got
home i was expecting to come into an efap midway in the middle but no no no i was it was the middle
the entire thing oh yeah we're all it's always the middle uh i'm doing my part are you i'm getting
married today hi rags oh hello sorry to hear that but don't worry it'll all turn out okay
yes um and yeah with that thank you for watching everybody this will be live on moola as soon as
it can be and we will see you next week uh tool tip cheerio bye bye
