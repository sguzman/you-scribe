Oh my god, you don't even got the thumbnail.
Oh no, you will stream, they say. You will stream, whether you like it or not.
How do I stop one of them?
I don't even know what's happening on one of them.
It's not public, it's not live though, it's just scheduled. It's like waiting for Mauler.
Okay...
Yeah, Mauler.
What the...
Is that not the thing I told you that I was hoping wouldn't happen?
Yeah, but is that upcoming one still there now, or is that gone?
I always get those, and I don't know what to do with them, so I just private them.
You know what they're gonna say? They stream 30 hours a week, and they don't even know how to stream.
They're stupid.
I really don't when YouTube changes all the fucking rules on me all the time.
To be fair, I didn't know before.
Well, this is just the new thing that OBS is doing to me.
It asked me more questions than it ever did, and it doesn't need to. Go away.
Stop asking questions.
Okay, that one I've...
Video's available to everybody, that's fine.
Okay, I've got them...
Yeah, I've reversed them, right, so...
Unlist that one, public this one.
Okay, YouTube? Are you following me?
It is...
The one that I was on is now unlisted, okay.
It's...
Just give it five minutes, it should work out.
This is a complicated project.
We're live, we're live, dude.
We're live.
It's all debate, discussion, and discourse from the dawn of time.
We have a strong effort to belure the line between subjects.
Yeah, we're live.
Yeah, see?
That's me, that's my mic.
No, no, no, it was playing my video for me then.
Also, yeah, chat, don't worry, I'll get you on screen in a sec.
That's another thing that's been happening.
I have to reset chat every time, but I can't even do it through OBS anymore.
Until it streams live to find the fucking link I need.
This is such...
Oh, no!
This is now insanity, and I don't know why.
I had to do this the first time, but don't worry, we'll get started soon enough with non-nonsense.
There you go, chat's on screen.
I won't be having non-nonsense on effect.
As the manager, I disapprove of that.
Oh, it's just...
Why make it so difficult?
I will have you replaced.
Why make it so difficult?
That is my question.
I like how YouTube never does anything to make things better.
It's always worse.
Yeah, like nine out of ten times, what they decide to do is actually worse for everyone in every way.
I was going to say, my first thought was, no, no, no, no.
Remember when they went back on their...
They didn't remove the verified ticks, but that wasn't it making it better.
That was just them not fucking it up for once.
Right, exactly.
That was them deciding to go back on something that would have been better.
They didn't actually make anything better.
They just decided, oh, we're going back on the thing that would have made it shitty.
Do they not want me to stream through OBS anymore or something?
Is that what this is?
I can't even tell.
I have to change the thumbnail.
I've got two upcoming streams now.
Thanks.
Oh, I can't wait.
Unlisted, this is visible to...
How do I get rid of this?
Go away.
Stupid.
This is going to be the most interesting intro to eFap in history.
Just listening to me struggle.
This is objectively the worst intro.
This is what it's like to listen to Swann.
I mean, it's not that bad.
So I guess while...
I guess while Mauler figures everything out,
the rest of us should come up with some kind of a topic.
Some sort of discussion.
Talking about the Mandalorian, I like it.
Me too.
Next topic.
Next topic.
All right.
Let's talk about...
I mean, what else has been on the news, I guess, that's relevant?
Yeah, I mean, I guess.
Oh, yeah, that's going really great.
I'm sure they're very glad that they went through with that.
Let's pick something that isn't controversial, like Trump.
The Holocaust.
Like spreading butter with a sword.
I don't think the Holocaust is controversial.
I think everybody's got the same opinion on it, right?
Yeah, I think we're all in agreement.
It's just like everyone's way of someone disagreeing.
All right.
Okay, all right, all right.
I just saw the stupid chat that's a reference to my book.
Thank you for reading it.
I know we can do while I make sure everything's right.
I've got a whole bunch of questions for Shad,
because there were super chats that were sent in
after you'd left the previous eFap.
Hey, awesome.
Oh, wow.
This one came up.
Me and Rags essentially went through it because of Google images
and Wikipedia's and stuff.
But, hey, you can give your expert perspective on explaining
the difference for the chat from an expert right here,
paid professional, okay?
Oh, that is so funny that you think I'm an expert.
Shad, expert person.
What is the in-depth difference between morning stars
and evening stars?
Ah, it's a semantical.
Like, morning stars, people can never really decide
on what the official definition is.
And this is a larger problem with medieval history,
but also history in general, because the general use of words
goes along with just the common vernacular,
which often changes and contradicts.
And the perfect example is like broadsword,
because broadsword has never been a historical, you know,
definition of a type of sword, but now it's entered into popular
language that it means arming sword.
And so, like, you can't really fight against what,
because language evolves all the time.
I mean, you know, the word awful didn't used to mean bad.
It meant something that was worthy of being full of awe,
which was great.
And so, going back to the whole morning star thing,
the general kind of consensus is just if it's a round,
like, spherical thing with spikes on it,
it could be class as a morning star,
whether it's on the end of a stick or on the end of a chain.
But there's nothing really official, official.
All right.
There you go, folks.
We've ended the debate.
It's done.
We did it.
Over.
What else have we got?
Oh, what do you want to do?
It's really interesting.
Well, yeah, it's just really interesting when you get the
mega historian pendants that come after you
for not using the definitions that they demand
are legitimate.
And I'm kind of caught in a rock and a hard place because
I see the definition that most people use casually.
And then I see a historical definition that is, you know,
a few hundred years out of date.
And then it's like, okay, what should I try and push towards?
Should I try and push towards something that's a hundred years
out of date or just go along with something that, you know,
more commonly understood?
And I generally actually go along with what's more
commonly understood because it's easier to be understood.
It's being pragmatic with language, right?
Yeah.
Being understood is the point of speaking.
That's very controversial, sir.
Well, I've made a video on it, right, about how language
messes up historical accuracy.
And most people are like really fine with it,
but then some German guy made a reply video that I only
got like half of it because of translation issues,
but he was not happy with me.
And yeah, so he didn't like it.
Um, Chad, would you recommend a chainsword when fighting a spider?
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
I mean, if you've got a fun web coming at you,
like that's probably what you need.
Well, chainsword would be good against a spider.
Yeah, I would say that might be a little like underkill.
You might want to go with a nuke or something.
Yeah.
You know, sort of shotgun would be your safe bet.
But if you've got enough money, then yeah,
a cyber would be a good choice.
So I am only, yeah, I'm thinking about the Australian spiders
and a nuke seems about the appropriate.
You're going to make a video on the nuke sword or?
The nuke sword.
Nuke sword mightier than the sword.
Yeah.
Chad, what fictional sword would you like to own?
Uh, imperious.
Uh, what's that from?
It's well, yeah, it's from my book.
Yeah.
I mean, what do I like when you're writing something and you've got
this cool sword, you obviously want to make the coolest one that you can
think of.
So it's going to go to the top of the list of the ones you like.
I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and assume disqualifying your own.
What would you pick?
Uh,
uh,
like I have the design and then I have favorites for, um,
a utility, like the shard blades from, um,
from Stormlight archives, Brandon Sanderson are pretty darn awesome.
And so for utility purposes,
I'll probably go shard blade and cool factor.
If I was going for design and realism,
it might be undoing the like shards of NASA.
Like the sort of,
it has a couple of, you know,
Aragon's one.
Yeah, it's a beautiful, beautiful sword.
Yeah, it's a good one.
Um,
I was thinking I'd probably,
if I thought about it for a while,
I probably wouldn't go for one that has some kind of magical property
that can do something of some kind.
Um,
I know there was the,
did you ever read the predain Chronicles?
Cause they had that fuck off fire sword on that one.
Unfortunately I have not read it.
Um,
Yeah, they were all right.
I read them as a kid,
so I don't know if they're really good or not,
but, um,
this, the black cauldron books is probably what most people would know them as.
Do lightsabers count?
No,
we'll have to disqualify them.
Like if,
if you bring lightsaber into the real world,
would it operate under real world physics or the physics as they had
portrayed in star wars?
Because my assumption is that lightsabers as portrayed in star wars,
they've just found some way in real world physics to make that happen.
And that's what it's telling us.
But, but they contradicted,
like generated as much heat as they're showing in the Phantom Menace to melt
through steel.
You touch someone with it and you,
you would instantly vaporize their blood into gas,
which would cause a massive explosive expansion.
And so a lightsaber is an instant person exploding weapon.
When it comes to star wars,
there's a lot of stuff that just, um,
cause it, you know, there's no sound in space and there aren't big fiery
explosions cause there's no air.
It would just snuff out immediately,
but we just accept it.
Just cause it looks cool.
Yeah.
Stuff out immediately.
Explosions.
Well, cause explode fire needs oxygen to us.
So any fiery explosion,
not the actual explosion itself though,
like things would explode,
but the thing is it like immediately.
It's like in gravity.
Where the space station blows up and it just proof.
And then it's, it's gone basically instantly.
Yeah.
Once it burns off the oxygen from inside of it, it's just gone.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
It's not like we accept it cause it looks clean because it's burning all that
fuel constant.
Yeah, but it looks cool.
So we're happy with it.
Imagine like, so I don't even know if this would be accurate,
but like someone fires a laser that you like block slash absorb the lightsaber,
but instead it just like travels through and melts into some gassy,
horrible, hot stuff and splashes into the Jedi's face.
I think because science actually tried to break down the numbers.
If a lightsaber could block a bullet and turned out or just turn it into
molten metal that would fly in the person's face.
So that would be horrifying.
Yay.
But you know,
it'd be like alien blood, you know,
Chad, are you aware of the Netflix movie coming out in November called the
King?
Ha.
Yes, of course.
I was when they mentioned that from the last stream,
but by this time I've done a whole review on it and I didn't like it.
I wasn't happy with it.
That's very inaccurate.
Oh, there you go.
What about the themes?
No, the themes were even worse.
Oh no.
The overarching themes was that King Henry was a manipulatable,
weak, pathetic man who was goaded into, you know,
fighting France and all that stuff.
And so the overall themes were also bad in my opinion.
I'm sure they'll add a strong,
independent black female queen who will set everything straight before,
you know, close.
She wasn't black, but she was that it was actually from the,
the princess at the end spoilers, but I didn't like the movie.
So, you know, I don't think you'll miss much.
Um, but yeah, I, that was the female French princess that basically,
you know, rips off his testicles and emasculates him on screen saying how
pathetic he is.
And, uh, I'm like, oh, it was so like just turned mindset was so modern
sensibility injected into historical period.
It was horrendous.
I'm sure they'd get away with that in the past.
Oh, oh yeah, definitely.
This says, uh, Shad, give us some SA four details.
SA four.
That's all I've got.
SA four sword and analysis.
Uh, it's a for saw a semen armor.
Who are you writing an essay for?
It's not shadow of the conqueror.
People usually prefer that, but.
Salamander ass burgers.
See if, uh, they've got anything for you to help us out.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Oh, ah, so I saw my archives.
No, I don't have any details on some of my guys.
Brandon is still writing the, uh, the rough draft and so he hasn't even
completed yet.
He is quite an expedient writer.
I gotta say like he, he gets a lot done, which is very impressive for
someone like me who gets nothing done.
Hey, someone just to send me this.
A nuke sword.
That was quick to be quick.
Yeah.
These people are like immediate with this shit.
It's terrifying.
Like, uh, like more than the other day.
Showed me a bunch of the, uh, the, uh, what was it?
Diabeto memes.
Oh yeah.
I started a folder.
We had some like several pieces of original artwork that were like
downright awesome stuff for Diabeto.
That stream, that stream, by the way, it got hit with a copyright thing,
but it's cleared up already.
I'm going to release it tomorrow while this one then downloads and uploads.
So yeah, you're going to get Diabeto tomorrow.
This one will be a few days after.
Probably.
Oh, that's great.
Yes.
I haven't.
It's happening now.
This one right now.
Not even finished.
It's promising that it's going to come out eventually.
That's my, I, I am now, uh, I just got an email from YouTube.
I can now, uh, I can now.
Mana monetize dog bites.
Excellent.
Hooray.
Hooray.
That is actually really good.
Hooray.
The chat has the name for the nuke sword.
The Hiroshima.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh my God.
It's such a clever name.
Even though it's so simple.
The Hiroshima.
Yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
With the sounds you just made.
There could be a lot of videos.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
I just got to share my appreciation.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's fair.
We were like those two guys at the end.
Uh, the two people at the end of notes from Melanie, we were just having, we just coming
straight up and coming is been well received by the way.
I was concerned, but, uh, everyone seems to be on board.
We might pursue looking into a format where we live review something that's more like a film, just to see how it goes, see how things stand up to screw me.
Possibly. The problem with Saving Private Ryan is that I feel like I need to look into accuracy stuff in order to have something to say about it, you know?
Because I don't actually know how accurate it is. I just think it's really popular.
Ah, well, well, I do remember reading that a lot of World War II veterans had to leave during the Omaha beach landing because it was that...
It brought them back to it in a very real way.
Oh, well, sure. I think that doesn't surprise me at all, but like, you know, even stuff that they may not even be aware of, I'm curious about just old details.
Well, V said that Event Horizon was objectively bad.
Event Horizon, isn't that from Paul W.S. Anderson?
It is, and it's usually the movie I reference to say he's not all bad.
I would like to rewatch that. I haven't seen it in a long time.
I'm not saying it's a great film, but I liked it a lot and I wouldn't mind rewatching it for maybe any fat movies.
I've never met anyone who didn't like it. It's kind of got a pretty big cult following to the point where even columning it a cult following is almost seems like a misnomer.
Perhaps. Oh, this one's for Shad and Fringy. These are super chats, by the way, that I'm just trying to get out ready before Shad eventually has to leave.
There's 10 million more of them. Shad Fringy, when will Cronulla riots to Electric Boogaloo happen?
Oh, what?
I predict in two years, 24 days and three hours.
I don't know, actually. I don't know about that one.
Let's think about that one. This one says good job Shad on asking Brandon about TLJ.
That was hilarious. Brandon's reaction was great. He was like, oh, you're going to get me in trouble because you could tell he didn't like it.
He was very, very diplomatic about it. But he didn't mention that what they did to Luke just was horrible for him.
You often get your politics labeled for you depending on whether you like that film. So you've got to be careful.
And Brandon is such a good writer, like a phenomenal writer. I felt it would almost be impossible for him to have liked it because there is so much wrong with it.
And if you have a good understanding of story on like even a basic level, you could not like the Last Jedi. There's so much wrong with it.
So I was confident in his answer.
Liking the Last Jedi is actually illegal now.
So you're not going to stand this, Shad, but it's still directed at you. Will you give Homecoming leeway for being in the Disney fanatical Marvel Universe?
I don't get it. It's a reference to a guy who kept arguing that the faults of the Disney films don't matter because you're supposed to accept that they're in a Disney fanatical universe.
No, I disagree completely because. Well, I mean, yeah, that's that's not a good argument. By the way, by the way, I liked Homecoming. It was far from home that I didn't like. Yeah.
I was just going to say that like the point I think the guy was trying to make was this is new continuity to stop judging it by old stuff. And it's just like it's a sequel that doesn't make any sense.
Are we supposed to make sense of any of the shit that's happening in these films without considering the ones that came before when the crazy ghost puppet Yoda turns up?
What are you supposed to think of that if you haven't seen the other films?
Oh, holy crap. You imagine that with no context. You'd be like, what the it's a ghost puppet.
And we had a good long debate on the merits of Far From Home. And we did put down legitimate problems with it just by itself out of context.
Yeah, it's it's got more problems than Homecoming does. That's for sure. Even though I think both movies are quite good. It has more issues than Homecoming.
Yeah, next up is really tightly written. Yeah, I think Homecoming is pretty strong. Chad, did you get hooked up with a bonsai?
Like a bonsai tree? I assume a form of sword, a make of sword. I assume it's not tree. But if it is, did you?
Can you spell it like B-L-N-S-A? It's spelled the same way as the tree.
I don't think so. I mean, the katanas that I have on hand aren't like, like one is half decent, but I got that for friends. I don't even know the make and model of that one.
And I got a pretty good Lockwood sword, but that's like my best one. It's the long sword that I usually wear in videos.
But outside of those, I don't actually know many of the makes of the other swords because they're lower end. I mean, I got a Tinker long sword. That's common.
Yeah, I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think I've got bonsai. Chad, what do you think about Adeptus Custodus halberd guns in Warhammer?
Well, halberds are epic. Sorry, not halberds. Halberds are epic. And if you could shoot them as bullets, well, that's just next level awesomeness.
So like I would have to full approval. Yep. Oh, and then I guess the follow up was that I attached to this was it's pronounced Adeptus Custodus.
But yeah, I don't know anything about Warhammer, unfortunately. I think I think this is a picture of it right here. Well, that's pretty nifty looking. Oh, nice.
Oh, lovely. Probably kill it. It's even got a magazine and shoot it multiple times.
So you can stab it into somebody and shoot them with it while it's paled in them. I mean, that's stupid. It's stupid, but it's cool. Stab it through someone and then shoot someone standing behind them.
Well, this is the thing, right? I mean, bayonets have been, you know, attachments to firearms for a long time already. And I've done a whole video exploring gun swords because gun swords have existed historically.
But the main issue why gun swords haven't really become a huge prominent thing and even why bayonets aren't universally attached to all swords is that it throws off the weight of the gun and your aim fairly significantly.
And so if you had super strength that it wasn't an issue, I could see a weapon like that thing. And so with space Marines, yeah, because they got super strength from their armor and they're also genetically enhanced.
A weapon like that, perfectly viable. I would say. Yeah, because I mean, you can run out of bullets, but if you've got a blade on you, you know, there is a reason why they have bayonets.
I've got a bunch for Wolf. I guess I forgot to ask him, but I'll get around to it when he's back on you.
One last one we can I can throw out. And this is for Jay. I really like just even universe video thoughts on Gravity Falls.
Thank you. And it's really good. One of the best cartoons I've ever seen.
I haven't watched enough of it to say that. I do really like it, though. It's only two seasons and it tells a very complete story.
Anyway, no milk is forever. No, they stopped it because they got they were done with it.
There's the there's like space to make like a you know, like a maybe 10, 20 years on show from it, which if the original creators announced, I would be like so stoked for.
But if anyone else picks it up, I'd be like, no, fuck off.
Oh, I hope I'm for rags, I guess I am previously.
I decided to use my to pay to buy a gaming PC. But alas, I am not a computer smart.
Where should I go to build the best PC? Where should you go?
What you want to do is if you're going to set aside a lot of money like that, you just want to learn, learn, learn, learn, learn about the parts and what you need for what you want to game with.
Did he say it was his first?
If it's his first, he doesn't say if it's first or not. Honestly, if it's his first, you might want to just dial it back a little bit.
Yeah, maybe start off with something a lot more modest so that you can kind of learn a bit or see you know that you want to jump all the way into it just to make sure I don't think you'll regret it.
But you know, that is a lot of money.
The thing is, when it when it was me, my first PC was about $1,000. The PC I'm playing on now was about $2,000. And I built it knowing a lot more, you know, at this point.
Yeah, but you the internet really is your best friend. Look at a lot of reviews of things. Look at all kinds of different forums and threads and just all sorts of stuff.
There's so much information out there. Yeah, there's just a lot of good info out there.
Take advantage of it. Just learn, learn, learn. Never feel rushed into buying something. That's one thing. Never ever feel like you you got to get it now. You got to get it now.
It's like parts will always be there. So don't worry about feeling pressured into, you know, going sunny day.
This might be heresy, but you could you could consider buying a prebuilt gaming PC. Just not heresy. Not heresy. What I would say is if you you can generally get really good priced gaming PCs from just people looking to get rid of theirs.
The Craigslist thing, eBay thing, if someone's local and you can go there and see that it works and all that stuff, that wouldn't necessarily be a bad option because they just want most people just want to get rid of it.
They don't have any overhead. They just want to sell it, get it out. So you could potentially score a really good PC for the price doing that.
There's a lot of different options. There's a lot of different options. But it cites from PC, part picker to Tom's hardware to this, that and the other thing. YouTube is full of reviews of all kinds of different parts, but also kind of set how serious of a gamer you are.
It sounds like you're pretty into it if you're going to put aside, you know, two grand for a PC. So, you know, do you want to play at 1080p? You'll probably be playing at 1440p.
You're going for 1440p, maybe even 4K for a handful of games.
Yeah. So I mean, I'd say go 1440p and get that really good FPS. You know, that's what I do. And I don't regret it. Especially if you're like night and day.
I picked a 4K monitor because it's got more like space to work on. But for gaming, yeah, you probably would be better off with a smaller but faster refresh rate computer. Not computer display.
But yeah, man, just use resources and learn, learn, learn.
What's pretty neat is thought worth mentioning is that thanks to the amount of members, I was able to add three more emotes.
I've thrown in a Tism, a maul of Tism. It's just a nice little picture that can represent Tism. I shall post it now if it shows up for me. Sorry.
Join to unlock. I am the thing. Why would I have to do this? I own you. Pay yourself five pounds now.
Oh, it just seems that this happens a lot. I was in my real like primary account and then it signed me into my Google account. Like when I refresh the page, it does this a lot. It really fucking annoys me.
But you know, what are you going to do? Anyway, the first one is maul of Tism. As you can see, beautiful little image. You can possibly be posted when we discover something of particular relation.
We got a little festive emote with the maul of Santa. He's ready for Christmas coming around the corner.
And I decided to throw in one from the favorite from the Discord, Varys, having a bit of a vomit. So you can just post that if you feel like it's particularly suitable.
I thought they were pretty neat. There's a whole bunch of moats. Just another way to support the channel. If you're interested and you get some fun tisms to look at, which brings me into talking about some fan art that was made, made me aware of.
Yeah. Someone emailed this to me. Well, I'm going to I'm going to build it up. So first of all, he did icons for me, Wolf and Rags.
This is the Wolf icon. And then we've got like a Christmas version for each of them as well. So I'm just going to show these first. They're pretty neat.
I believe Wolf is already using his Christmas icon. I shall be. And I think the next podcast this planned will actually be the first of December. So that'll work out nicely.
And you've got Rags and the Christmas version.
The eyelashes really sell it.
Look at the sexy Rags. Oh, I can. Oh, man. Oh.
And then one for me as well.
And the reason why I'd be praising these more, but I'm trying to get to somewhere that you guys will see in a moment. So these are all essentially cut out and added to and changed to to match these things from a bigger picture that he that he made.
Is this the story, right? Rags, that he's been in hospital for a while, watching you.
Yeah, I believe I didn't use it. Yeah, he was the guy who was in the motorcycle accident. Right.
And he went through and he basically watched, I think, like all the faps because he had to be in a hospital for a while. Let me.
That's the yeah, he was in the motorcycle accident and he said he watched all of the fap over the last seven weeks. He said he says he's an art director by trade.
That seems right to me. So keep that in mind. He made something for us and I guess I'm going to put it on screen now and you may spend some time on this.
Just checking it out. Here's a link to you folks.
It is very good. Yeah, it's very good. And it's.
Yeah, I guess something else. And I'm envious of this guy's talents.
So it's one thing that is extra amazing about it is that the more you look at it, the more like all the references and mean this thing is dense.
So yeah, we're going to do some of that looking into it. So I'm going to I'm going to make it full screen on the streams. Can't even see us.
So you can get a big old picture of it. If you're listening to this, just just do it all up in a full screen.
So you've got a shit ton of the first thing I actually want to point out is you can see to the right of rags. There is the Korean musician person who is.
This is a meme from literally like the last stream and it's in here. Right there. This is yeah, it is very recent.
This is insanely good.
I mean, at this point, it's just like point out whatever you want, folks, because it's like the Golden Stitch, Medea, Carl, the robot, Carl, the Terminator.
Luke is nothing. Luke has got his loud soup.
Yes, everyone's drinking Rhino Nog. Yes, they are. And they all have different like cups.
Good rat at the red pill. Correct. You have some intense titties there. They're all right.
Only two of them. Only two.
I've got something on my arm. The arm band.
I'm not sure what the symbol is. Obviously, I've got a badge for the toxic brood, I think.
I've got a little joker card. Yeah, I'm not. I'm guessing is that related to the fact that we've been defending Joker, I guess.
I suppose. And you have an IGC or a. Oh, well, that's down. What is that?
What is is that IGC? What is IGC? I feel like the chest probably going to get that one.
Also, the Dawn has slice and dice on his T-shirt. Yes, he does.
One thing, too, is that these he's got a pin on his jacket, which is like a hand with a blade coming down.
That's the hand of the king badge from Game of Thrones.
It might be related to Tywin Lannister, being that he's the apex homosexual. I don't know.
Oh, it might be. What's with the watermelon?
The watermelon. Is it just a watermelon?
Yeah, the behind the chicken, the with the raw, the eye of raw.
What is what is the melon? The melon is.
I'm a male. Oh, intellectual gaming community. That's what the IGC is.
Intellectual gaming community. That's it.
We and yes, we do have an inward pass behind Luke there.
Oh, yeah. Let's see, is is Jev in here? Do we have a Jev?
Is that Jenny Nichols in the right? No, that's the girl from the video.
Oh, yeah, that's yeah, that's the French thing, I think. Yeah.
Oh, I'm trying to see if I'm trying to see if Jev is in here.
I don't think he is actually like look because there's so much. Yeah.
Spider, we got. Wolf's got the. So what is what is that in Bilbo's breast pocket on his.
That is a plumbus. It's a plumbus. A plumbus.
Do you not know what a plumbus is? I know that I know the plumbus is Latin word for lead.
No, Rick and Morty. No, don't tell them. I don't.
I've not seen Rick and Morty, so. Yeah, that's a life.
Everyone needs a plumbus in their home. Yeah. First, they take out a dingle pop and they smooth it out with a bunch of sleep.
The sleep is repurposed for later batches. They take the right. What was it that they take the dingle?
This is actually what it is. Freeze pretty.
There's something to do with the thrombus. There's definitely a thrombus at one point.
They have to rub the fleab against it because the fleab has all of the fleab juice. Oh, yeah.
And he runs it. Yeah, they cut the. There's several hazards in the way.
And then it was something like they take the dingle pop and push it through the grumbo and then they shave something away.
I think that's 100 percent accurate. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. I got I got pretty encyclopedic Rick and Morty knowledge.
OK, so the the objectivity and subjectivity cherubs with me. But oh, it's weird.
Fuck. I don't know why you did. I was just about to say to focus on the cherubs because it's weird that we think like that.
So on the if you if you will stare at that cherubs ass on the top right, there is a tattoo on the left cheek that says Gen 1932 Gen 19.
Genesis is wait, is that a Bible Genesis? Oh, Genesis, nineteen thirty two.
Oh, my good. OK, Genesis, chapter 19, verse 32. Come, let us get our father drunk with wine so that he can sleep with him and preserve his line.
Oh, my goodness. That's the part where they get Moses, not Moses Noah. This is after Noah.
They get Noah drunk, so he'll fucking impregnate his daughters. Oh, my. Oh, oh, no.
This is a wholesome children's podcast. But it says tism subjectism subjectivity.
Oh, I'm testing and I tell you that has moments.
Massive. Yes, as well. And as some someone knows as well, some of these icons are the ones from their like channels and stuff.
But some of them are just custom made, which is really cool. Different ones are like redrawn.
Oh, yeah, Jared. One of those.
That's the one that pops out. There's an old one or that one.
The South Pole one has been redrawn. The chase face one, I think, might be redrawn.
Yeah, medals, definitely. Yeah, Southpaws is.
Who is that? Who is that above or above the mechanical? OK, first off, the mechanical owl.
Where's that? I know it's from the movie, but is that a meme that we I don't remember referencing.
Oh, wait, is maybe it's about that super chat we got a couple of times about how does an owl swim through a tree.
Remember that?
I was only referencing my head about hours of it. It's from the clash of the Titans.
I just noticed the good rat. Oh, yeah, sorry to interrupt. That was actually a scene with lots after Solomon Gamora and Noah.
Oh, that. OK. Yeah, I know Noah was an alcoholic, so I thought that was why they.
Oh, sorry. Jeb's on the milk carton.
Oh, there's Jeb missing Jeb. One point two billion percent on the milk carton.
Oh, that milk carton is like four and one. It's a lot of these ages and still see new stuff in it.
Yeah. Rhino milk missing Jeb. One point two billion percent.
Obviously, Don's got the McMuffin that you got a spider in there, too. Got to make sure you get that.
What do you got in your jacket there?
As a joke, I guess. Joker card.
You got the the alien as well from the gaming streams, and I guess he's trying to decipher some stuff like Hubert language.
Is this pumpernickel, rye, wheat, sourdough? Oh, because we were naming the kinds of bread.
Remember that. Oh, my God. That was a long time ago. Wait, sorry, that relates to the first name.
Wait, that relates to the old. What does that relate to? No, no.
He's reading the list. The alien is reading the list and the list is types of bread, pumpernickel, rye, wheat, sourdough, focaccia, because ages ago.
That was like bully with like key fat. Yeah, that was a long time ago. That's an ancient meme. That one just. Oh, man.
I remember. I remember because I remember coming on thinking like having no idea what the podcast was going to be like.
And then just there was a point where you were all listing types of bread and I was like, oh, OK.
This is a podcast for me.
I do like we got the Karl Terminator on the opposite side on the left because Karl.
Did we say he's got what looks like a license plate with? No, it says roof access.
Oh, what's that a reference to my forgetting? Probably wrong.
Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Maybe. Yeah, it might be. I assume so.
Oh, there's a Skittle. There's a Skittle if you look right below it. I remember this. Oh, yeah. And a Pokeball.
And a Pokeball.
That's a Batwoman orang. There's a cat of weird grapes next to Jay.
Wait, where? Oh, yeah. How are we still seeing new stuff in this?
Spider Man. That's good. That's that good.
This is dense.
OK, so there's a slingshot in Bilbo's outer pocket.
I don't know if that's tied to Bilbo or if that's tied to a meme.
A slingshot.
Hmm. I don't know what the slingshot is.
Maybe someone mentions that it'll come to mind again.
Now, there's an alien reading a scroll. Have you already talked about that or have I missed that one?
Yeah, we talked about it.
Below the fucking Isle of Man flag.
Yeah, the Isle of Man flag is my fucking favorite.
Who's the who's the guest up into the left of the Isle of Man flag?
Jay Longbone or is it somebody else?
I do know. I don't know who that is. Is Jay Longbone.
Is she on any of the others?
That might that might be her if.
Oh, my God, I didn't even notice Kyle Bennett till now.
He's in the frame.
That's an old team mate too. He's one of the ones that kicked off the meme war.
Like he just memes. Yeah, Kyle Ben.
Oh, people are saying it's related to Goliath, the slingshot.
Slingshot is related to Goliath.
Slingshot Goliath, a lot of different people are saying it.
I think that was just the fucking face of the cosmic chicken is making it look so proud of itself.
Yeah, this is the cosmic chickens work.
Goliath slingshot.
I don't even really remember that.
I remember Goliath, of course, but the slingshot part, I don't.
And yeah, we totally can't remember every meme. We do our best.
Oh, we got the massive missile.
Oh, yeah. That's on my right arm. Yeah.
Is it a rocket?
But I don't actually really know what it is.
Yeah, not sure what the armband is.
Oh, the sling of shots, I guess, is the slingshot.
Have you guys pointed out the JJ McGuffins that the Don is holding?
JJ McGuffins. I believe so. It's got a porg on it.
Yeah, it's got a porg nuggets, flares.
I keep thinking, OK, clearly I've noticed everything about this now and then seeing something else.
But now I've clearly noticed everything.
The watermelon, though, I can't call the watermelon.
Yeah, there's a couple we lost on, but I mean, it's amazing work.
Wonderful. And a nice sort of voting.
Well, I'm glad to land where they do not possess the sling of shots.
This is where you can send people when you're like, they're like, what does he have about like this?
Oh, this is great. This is insane.
Like I didn't want to pour over it too closely because I figured we'd look at it.
But just kind of going all around and.
I mean, Wolf's got. Wolf has pineapples on the pizza.
What does he said about that? Is he OK with that?
I hope so. Or is it just a reference to the fact that that was discussed?
Because I don't know. I thought. Is Wolf OK with it?
I can't remember. Maybe there's lots of ways to interpret it.
Maybe he's not OK with it or is he right? Yeah, that's the question.
And there's the snitch from Harry Potter, the Golden Snitch and the top left.
The watermelon could be a reference to my first video.
Oh, yeah, it could. Yeah.
And Bridal the Rage.
Yes, Sid Nicholson.
I'm assuming he's got some kind of page in some way before maybe where he does this.
This work professionally or whatever, but it's amazing stuff.
Yes, it is.
And yeah, I guess we will we will carry on with us.
That's our intro. Forty five minutes. We did it.
Let's see how we go.
We will move on to the first forty five minutes and fucking out.
All right.
You know, but before we continue, I just got to thank you guys for introducing,
you know, Jay paladin's content, because I've watched some of the videos
and they are amazing.
And I've been building fully awesome.
Is Aiden paladin. Sorry. Yeah.
Yeah. No, she's she was a wonderful guest.
The research. Yeah.
The research she puts into her video is just insane.
And we are a big fan of research here.
Oh, yes.
That's why we like you should.
Yeah. Thanks.
Yeah, you know, that's an easy segue, guys. Watch.
So, yeah, we like like research to like, you know, accuracy.
We like expression of those things through opinions.
That's what we're going to be talking about today.
You know, opinions.
So so the first there's two YouTubers we cover.
Well, three YouTubers are covering actually.
And we'll do our best to get through it, you know, at a reasonable pace.
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Here is the link to jump right in.
We will be covering Arlo.
Now, Fringy, you probably have a better context for this than I do in terms of what's going on.
But it's something to do with pandas.
Sorry.
Oh, pandas. Right.
For this video.
Yeah. So, yeah, I was just going to say like the what I understand is that a new Zelda game came out.
He was unhappy with the art style and a lot of people.
Ah, yes.
A Link's Awakening.
Yeah. And like he made statements and he got frustrated that he was getting flack for it.
Was that it?
Well, what I think it was was so, yeah.
So because video is Arlo, who's a YouTuber that I'm subscribed to and largely enjoy.
I just guess put that preface out first.
I actually really like his presentation style, too, with the puppet thing.
It was actually pretty creative.
But, yeah, no, it was a Link's Awakening was coming out.
And the big sort of discussion that was happening with that game was the art style because it has a sort of it sort of looks like a toys kind of thing.
Toys come to life art style, lots of simple, simple looking character models, but some really detailed texture work and things like that.
And the discussion was sort of surrounding innovative art styles because when Nintendo does it, it's generally they generally do it well.
The usual examples would be I think the first example would be Yoshi's Island because that's got a storybook kind of art style and Miyamoto really pushed for it.
And that game looks incredible to this day.
And then, of course, the other obvious contender is Wind Waker because when Wind Waker came out, I think a lot of people were expecting it to really push a realistic thing to sort of follow in the way of Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask.
And retrospectively, we all realized that they made a really good decision because Wind Waker is pretty timeless.
And so with the discussion regarding this game, I think that was the same point that people were trying to make.
It's like, I don't know, man, maybe we should like Nintendo generally does a good job.
So and this looks pretty good.
And I think I think it was the whole video was brought about because of this discussion of people's opinions on the art style of of Link's Awakening.
And that's what that's what sort of spawned this video.
And unfortunately, it's not a very good one.
Well, that will remain to be seen.
We're going to use it as a vehicle to talk about his ideas on opinions and some other things.
Is everyone in the wash together?
Oh, sorry.
Yes.
I called Judy.
Hold on.
This is a guy man.
So unprofessional.
Can I plug my petition?
Oh, yeah. Go for it.
Oh, yeah.
It's for a good cause.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Do you want to just give you give like a summary of what happened with that and then end with the petition?
Yes.
So Elastifat was Elastifat that we talked about bullshit stuff before that.
OK, so when we covered no bullshit and his comments on the FAP and on me, I made a full video breaking down Brooks's comments and showing how they're just like objectively false and like incredibly very, very obvious ways.
I say the opposite of what he claims I said.
And I have a video on that.
So today Brooks was taking Snipes with me on Twitter where he went after nothing but my appearance.
And like, yeah, that's basically what it looks like.
Goofy.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And the fact that I'm like, you know what, I think the trans people, they're good.
Not as a not as a not better than anyone.
Controversial tank.
Out his tweet was like fucking his tweet was like, oh, if someone's saying this, no wonder they have a problem with my content.
I'm like, dude, I don't think you realize that's a cell phone.
Yeah.
What do you think?
Of course, he doesn't know that it's not because he's an idiot.
Imagine saying that thinking you're defending yourself.
But in that video, I just throw a joke comparing Brooks to a guinea pig.
Right.
Because, you know, that's like he kind of looks like a guinea pig.
He's got little like the chubby cheeks and the teeth.
Right.
He looks a little bit like a guinea pig.
Sort of skinny like.
And so and I also made the point that like clearly no bullshit is a classic case of poor branding.
So I made a suggestion that he should change his profile picture to a picture of a guinea pig from GeForce, the film GeForce 2009.
Has anyone seen that?
It's really, really good.
Wow.
I'm sure.
I know.
You're the first person to say it's the perfect film.
It's the perfect film.
OK.
No, nothing better.
It's a masterpiece.
But I made a petition and it's for Brooks to change his profile picture to the picture of a guinea pig from GeForce.
And so far, one thousand six hundred and forty nine people have signed it.
No, I'm posting the chat.
People can assuming it lets you if I don't know if I can post links in the chat.
So, yeah, everyone will sign this.
We need to go by.
No, I'm not allowed.
I'm not allowed at me on the chat, like say something.
I can I'll just mod you and then you can do it.
But this this petition needs to go straight to the top.
So I need everyone watching right now to sign it immediately.
Oh, my God.
He needs to do it.
It's we need to make it law.
Now you can post the thing off.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Mugely.
Oh, that's my that's my not name, but true name.
Everyone sign sign now.
It's very important.
It's crucial.
If we can get this done, you know, saving YouTube one step at a time.
That's all I'm saying.
Thank you for allowing me.
I don't know what you mean.
I don't know what.
We've just got 100 signatures.
I'm very proud of this community.
Oh, wow.
No petitions are gay.
Exactly.
That's why we have to use it on him.
He thinks everything's gay.
You have to reinforce it.
Petitions aren't gay if you say no home after signing them.
Yeah.
All right.
So, yeah, that was a fun saga.
But back to this.
So like I said, this this shouldn't be as frustrating as like your typical
stuff, but we're mostly going to let it play.
I think it's only like halfway through the video that we have to go up to
because he changes topics and he's going to give us some context at first as well.
But yeah, here we go.
Is everyone ready?
Yeah, I suppose I'm ready to begin this journey.
Excellent.
Hello, my friends.
I hope you are well today.
I'm here to talk about Zelda.
But alas, this isn't a celebratory reaction.
It's a celebratory reaction or a classic retrospective or a three and a
half hour long review, but a close look at the controversy surrounding the
art style of the upcoming Link's Awakening remake.
Oh, I actually pause it.
Arlo is a bit of a long man.
He did a three and a half hour review on Breath of the Wild.
Excellent.
That's actually a pretty good review.
It's a pretty good review.
So, yes, the merits of being a long man.
Yeah, man.
Good.
Am I the only one who didn't know he was a puppet?
Well, the thing is, I'm probably the only one who subscribed to him.
I have to admit that took me a little off guard.
Well, with very diversity, if I will cover anybody, puppets are allowed.
Well, I mean, we've had puppets on.
Yeah, that's right.
Yes, we have.
True.
Puppet inclusive podcast.
Pretty cool.
It's time to listen to a dissipation from Cookie Monster.
Let's go.
Absolutely.
I don't think he likes it when you say Cookie Monster.
I don't think he likes it when you say that.
Well, it's clearly the same thing he shows in a puppet that looks like the fucking Cookie Monster.
Oh, well, I'm just I'm just kidding.
It's just like I think in a video that he made recently, he mentioned, like, yeah, the Cookie Monster.
But I think he's trying to avoid that.
Well, how do you even avoid the comparison, though?
Well, you don't because it's very much like it's not like a Muppets puppet, right?
This is definitely a straight.
Appropriate.
This is like just seeing Obama and saying, oh, look, it's Will Smith.
Oh, it's not.
It's not.
You can't do that.
Really racist.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, shadows.
It's like, oh, they all look the same.
It's like shad really.
They just have blue fur.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wait, they like cookies and smells.
They like to make, they like to be racially motivated genocide.
What?
I don't, I don't come up with this stuff.
I just report on.
I don't know if it's an accurate stereotype, but.
Well, I mean, have you heard about what's going on in puppet world?
No, there's a lot of puppet drama.
My MVU.
Convenience on trial.
Yep.
For genocide.
Oh, I don't know.
Cookie Monster image.
But for selling like, uh, you know, cookie dough, you know, illegally.
He's a kind of thing from Oscar.
Was the cookie dough poisoned?
Like it was going to go.
Oh, you expect it from Oscar.
Now, why would you say that?
What?
Just cause he's green fucking hell rags.
No, cause he's, he's, he lives in the garbage and he's me.
So homeless people commit genocide.
Okay.
Yeah.
Cause he's, yeah, maybe he did say it, but I inferred it.
It's because he's green.
He, his title is the grouch.
I would expect to grouch people commit, I would expect them to more than like
people who are just known for their love of people who are having a great day.
Probably not going to commit genocide.
It's probably true.
Maybe they're having a great day because they commit to genocide.
I just killed two people climbing up a ladder in modern warfare.
And like, I don't want to brag, but how the hell did they not notice me?
Why would that be?
I'm very proud of this because you're highlighting how stupid they are.
No, but I say how good I was.
Cause I aimed so well.
You aim so well at two guys on the ladder.
Yeah.
Ladder's move.
No, I was on the ladder.
You know, the pistol.
That's all I had.
Oh, I was on the ladder.
Oh, I think two guys on the ladder.
Oh, no, no.
And you shot him off the ladder.
Like you killed the ladder.
No, I know.
God damn it.
No.
All right.
Move on.
You are a ladder.
All right.
Then to sweat, to segue, then I don't have a problem being a puppet.
It could be a decision.
We'll just have to wait and see.
I'm sorry.
That sounds so much like you're genuinely responding to allegations
of being racist, like, I don't have a problem with it being a puppet.
I, I have puppet friends, but yeah, he's a puppet friends.
I don't know what they're talking about.
I have one puppet friend.
And in the art style of the.
Yeah, you need to get more puppet friends.
Apparently.
I mean, his name is token, but oh, shit.
We'll just move on, move on.
Upcoming links.
Awakening remake.
That's right.
The internet is currently split down the middle.
The Zelda community is up in arms.
Twitter is aligned with Savage Feud.
It's about the way it looks.
Oh, yesterday's shallow.
I mean, talking about it looks like a bunch of duking.
You know, I think these, I think he says later, these are made up, right?
For me, but he's just trying to highlight.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure these were made up.
Yes, because they're obviously very bad arguments, you know, for a position
that you've got 18th February, 2019 from earth, like, yeah.
Yeah.
Physical fights have broken out.
Okay.
Literally none of that is true, but I am seeing a lot of arguments about it.
And it all, yeah, it looks great.
It looks so good.
This is what I mean.
It's such a good looking game that I, it's probably the best looking game on
Switch, to be honest with you, even from a technical, it's great, isn't it?
Yeah.
That is absolutely charming.
I think it's adorable.
That is great.
That is, it's a wonderful looking game.
I remember it because it was like, it was like, fucking, it feels like it was
half a year ago when me and Franky first check this out.
Um, I remember talking to you about tilt shift, right?
Like, uh, it feels like a board game and they've done a really good job of
simulating that, a living board game.
Yeah.
It's, uh, it's, I mean, Nintendo is really good at, uh, doing, cause Yoshi's
Wooly World looks really great.
Uh, and Yoshi's Crafted World look really great.
They're really good at like doing real life stuff in video games.
It's, it's strange cause they're not known for graphical fidelity, but
it just looks so good.
Such a great art style.
Yeah.
Um, and now you'll have the context for, uh, the arguments covered up suit,
because that's what it's mainly about.
It's just the way this game looks.
Yeah.
The heck out of me, it brings up all sorts of questions about what
Zelda games should look what way.
Perhaps more interestingly though, it calls into question the nature of
opinions in the world of video games, which we almost unanimously
deem an artistic medium.
So let's dig into this whole thing and answer some questions.
Is this Wind Waker all over again?
Are people hating on the art style simply because it's different?
Oh yeah.
If you'll remember, cause I even, I remember this Wind Waker had detractors
of being like, this looks like a fucking shitty cartoon, that sort of thing.
And now they all look like wrong.
Right.
The first Zelda game to be like that, right?
It's cell shaded.
That's the style.
And it's a style that loads of people love.
And to define that a style is bad, you're going to have to bring in some arguments.
And Arlo does for this one.
I don't remember them being very agreeable, but hey, we'll check them out.
I don't know.
I feel like he's already trying to set up a straw man.
He made a statement and didn't, you know, like qualified a quarter.
It's like, well, you unanimously agree that to get, you know, video
games are an art form and like, okay.
So it's subjectivity though.
Oh yeah.
You get the implication is if it's art, that means this is going to be subjective.
And it's like, ah, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's no objective standards that you can apply to video games.
Well, if you're trying to say it, like video games in particular, like with
movies and stuff, I can understand why people have this subjectivity thing.
But with video games, like if the game doesn't work, that's not like my
fucking opinion, you know what I mean?
Like if I fall through the geometry, that's not my opinion.
If, uh, if it runs at like, yes, I can't do anything, but that's what
we mean, what, what they enjoy is irrelevant.
I could enjoy getting killed over and over again at spawn.
That could be like my thing, but it doesn't mean anything.
You know, yeah.
It's just generally, it's such a sneaky way to try and go about, um, by state,
by stating something, the universal standard that everyone just agrees with,
let's move on and it's like, well, hang on, hang on, hang on.
That's actually rather sneaky.
It's like, is it that cause by stating it's an art form that doesn't mean
it precludes it from being, uh, you know, many other things that objective
standards need to be applied to.
And I say, yeah, it's just like, I want, yeah.
It's, uh, it's interestingly, like not an opinion, I think is shared by developers.
I watched a, um, I watched a, an audio commentary from two developers who
worked on ratchet and clank two.
And I was talking about a puzzle that they designed on a Mac to our resort level.
And, um, the developer was talking about how badly he messed it up.
And the fact that like everybody recognized that it was a really poorly designed,
um, thing, and it's like, if the developers can recognize when they've done
well or poorly by some sort of standard, what you're going to disagree with them.
Like this is their job.
I don't know.
I mean, that's the thing I'm willing to hear the argument.
So if someone had that position, it's just going to be tough.
That's all also, um, I have linked the fan art, uh, that we showed the big billboard.
He went at the top of the description.
Now I think some people wanted to see it and I didn't foresee that cause I'm a
dumb dumb, but I'm just going to check is it, is it there?
Yes, it's there now.
You can click that to find it.
Okay.
Is it okay to dislike how the game looks?
Let's find out only slightly.
No.
And yes, there we found out video.
Okay, no, I guess we should go a little bit deeper than that.
I've got some opinions about the art style and some reasons why someone
might not find it ideal, but first let's touch on the whole opinion thing, which
is what spurred this video in the first place.
This is one of those topics that I've wanted to talk about for years now.
So it's nice to finally be given an opportunity in the context of Nintendo
and the switch and all that.
I have a pet peeve when it comes to opinions and it's extra aggravating
because I feel like this should be obvious.
This is a conclusion that I feel like everyone should eventually come to.
Not a great way to start.
Um, prefacing that you guys should have agreed with this.
You don't need to do that.
It should be honest.
That's what you're about to say.
Well, yeah.
If he says like one plus one is two, you'd be like, well, okay.
But I can't even imagine at that point.
Well, the thing is, from what I remember, he says something that I
kind of agree with later on, but it's the way he's tied it into this
discussion I don't really like.
Um, but we'll see that when it, when it comes up.
You like, this should be obvious.
This is a conclusion that I feel like everyone should eventually come to,
but for whatever reason, it's not.
There's a way to keep a conversation slash debate respectful and prevent
it from turning into an argument.
And it's this way.
Um, cause there's a way to keep a debate respectful to prevent
it from coming an argument.
An argument is an argument.
An argument is not just for sorry, mate.
You think the other person's probably wrong.
I think it's a connotation at the time.
Yeah.
Like, uh, you know how people say like, Oh, they got into an argument yesterday
or something like that, you'd be like, what they almost are saying instead
is though, those, those guys had a very unproductive battle almost.
Um, connotation to it.
Yeah.
Like the, but on its face, having an argument, fine.
You'd make arguments in a debate.
Typically it's just a weird phrasing, I guess.
Shouldn't have that stigma, but it does.
Correct.
Isn't it's not, there's a way to keep a conversation slash debate respectful
and prevent it from turning into an argument.
And it's this when you disagree with someone state your opposing
opinion instead of attacking theirs.
I'm sorry.
I, I'm, I had been, I'm at 39.
I guess I'm at a sink.
Oh, pull it back to a like 138 or earlier and we'll let it play for you.
Oh wait, I'm ahead of you as well.
Oh, because if I pull it back, it might not pull you guys with me.
So if you guys do it, one of you guys instead, I'll pull it back.
All right.
133 now.
Yes.
Uh, give it a second.
Oh, wait, mine's on 138.
Yeah.
Okay.
One with someone state your opposing opinion instead of attacking theirs.
Oh, well anyway, I can just read it out.
He said, when you make an argument, state your opposing opinion
instead of attacking theirs.
Uh, I like
instead of the wrong, for example, for example, I like John wick.
And then someone goes, I don't like John wick.
That's what he thinks they should do.
Instead of saying you shouldn't like John wick.
But the problem is it depends on what they say.
If you, if you can't test someone's opinion, it is there for
impossible to falsify any statement.
Well, that's, it's, it's kind of a state.
You need to go about arguing by never trying to prove or see if
someone's correct or incorrect because the thing is, the thing about,
if you got an opposing opinion, surely it's diametrically opposed, right?
Potentially.
If it's diametrically opposed, then you kind of like, you kind of
have to, uh, depending on what people say.
So for example, um, uh, Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor in John wick.
And someone goes, he's an amazing actor in John wick.
And it's just like, well, then one of you may be like inaccurate here.
Um, but with something a little bit more specific, you can say something
like, um, it was never set up that X thing happened and you go, yes, it was.
It was in this scene.
And they go, no, it wasn't that scene was blah, blah.
And it's like, Oh, you've already broken the rule because you guys
are attacking each other's positions now.
And this also depends on what exactly is the claim that they're making,
whether or not it's like a positive claim.
Like they're asserting that something is, you know, in the affirmative.
Um, in which case that you can attack it to take it down because you don't have
to have a position that's keep counter to it, you, you could be completely, you
could be completely apathetic to it in every way, but if you're in a
conversation like that, then you could attack what they're saying.
And that would be the argument.
And similarly, it's also a matter of wondering whether or not this is a
subjective or an objective opinion.
And, uh, go ahead.
Oh, well, I'll be quick.
So I was just going to say, uh, if they, you can test and experiment their
perspective without even being remotely hostile, as in they're talking about
something I've never heard of and they make a statement about it that I
don't really care about, like, um, uh, Nathan Fillion is, has never been a
part of the destiny franchise.
And then I go, I checked the IMDB page.
She's there.
Like, I don't care one way or another, but now I've just tested their
argument.
It's not, it's not holding up to scrutiny.
You know what I mean?
And if they saw that with confrontation, I'll just be like, what?
I just don't understand what you're saying.
I don't know where you've gotten it from.
Well, I think, uh, I think his position is from the position that all of the
takes are equally valid, but I think we know that that's not true.
Like if I said that, uh, if I said like the legend of Zelda is a pretty
bad first person shooter, it's like, okay, that's, that's a pretty bad, like
that's, that's worthless at that point.
Surely.
Let, let's take the, let's take the idea of if you're, uh, if we, cause this
is essentially kind of in the realm of debate strategy.
Um, but let's say somebody says, um, I believe that the earth is flat, right?
That would be different than someone saying, I don't know if the earth
is flat as their statement.
So you can't, you can't attack their lack of knowledge of something, right?
You can't, you can't go on the offensive about them saying, I don't know
if something is true or I don't know something, but if they're asserting
that this is the way it is, or if they're making a statement of belief, then
that's something that you can go after.
You have something to actually grasp on.
Well, I guess, um, this is really, it's interesting that the way that he
framed turning a debate into an argument is to attack the other person's position.
But if you've ever done, that's what I was going to bring up.
Yeah, I, okay, go ahead then.
Well, it's something very fundamental, uh, more fundamental in what it's saying here.
And again, it's one of these things where he stated something as it's a, it's just
a given where everyone agrees with it.
And he doesn't even qualify it when we, she frames this that in the context
that if you disagree with someone, he is claiming that as an attack and that
premise alone needs to be challenged.
And it's a big problem.
I actually find with a lot of people who are over syndrome where they perceive
anyone who disagrees with them as a personal attack, therefore their enemy.
And that is a big problem just in the world.
It's screws up communication.
Yeah, absolutely.
It's like, when I disagree with you, I'm not attacking you personally.
Okay.
I'm not calling you an idiot.
I'm saying, I think you're wrong for X, Y, Z.
And I want to show the reasons why.
And he's just taking it for granted that it's an attack.
That alone is a huge problem because from his perspective going forward, I'm
expecting now that he is going to perceive general arguments as bad and
disagreements as personal attacks.
And that's a big problem.
Well, what I find interesting is if you've ever done formal debates, I'm not
sure how it works in other countries, but when I did formal debates, when I
was in school, the structure was like, so you got, you got two teams and
there's three people.
So the first person on team one starts, they lead, they don't, they don't
rebut anybody, they just lead.
The person who follows them, generally what they have to do first is rebut
the arguments that were presented by the first person.
So that is how a debate works.
And you were saying that that's not how it works.
It's just, it's, you're unfortunately like, that's a, that's a debate format.
I was going to say, there are debates where the two people don't freaking
acknowledge each other, which is frustrated.
Oh, sure.
Sure.
But what I mean is it's, I personally don't like those.
Yeah, I don't like, there are formal debates where you rebut other people's
arguments, but Arlo's just said that that would turn it into an argument.
It's like, but it's, it's literally a formal debate.
Like we want a debate, not an argument.
And like, okay, what?
All right.
How are you meant to talk if you don't address what other people say?
I mean, he probably contradicts this own rule, because he probably
does this in this video.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What constitutes an actual attack.
And I say actual is almost like a meme.
I'm just like, you know what I mean?
Like an attack, like we really, you know.
Yeah.
Well, it is what, how you define what an attack is because attacking an
argument is not an attack against a person.
And so you should not perceive it as a personal attack when
your opinion is attacked.
And that's the, that's the big issue that I find a lot of
sent overly sensitive people have.
There's like, you're attacking me.
He's like, no, no, I'm just arguing.
Yeah.
And attack attacking only really works too.
When there's, um, when it's either one thing or the other, right.
Um, so is, uh, I guess in the frame of this video, it would be, you know,
this style is good for Zell, this guilt, Zelda game.
This style is not good for this Zelda game.
So if you were, if it has to be one or the other, it can't not be something else.
It has to be one of the two.
So in that sense, if you attack the other side, then you would probably
lend it to yourself that it would help convince them that you're correct.
Cause if it's not them, it's gotta be you.
It's not like there's a third option floating around.
Well, I think the idea is, um, or at least the theme with the video from what I
remember is we can all just agree to disagree, which I'm not content with.
Yeah.
I mean, if it, I mean, what's the point of talking?
If we're just going to disagree, you know what I mean?
Like, yeah, the only way that would be a reasonable resolution to an argument
is one that really is just a matter of like taste.
Right.
Cause that's something you, you cannot convince other people of that.
Cause that's based on an actual physical, personal experience or a
completely subjective preference.
Like you're not going to convince somebody who likes pineapple on pizza
that it's disgusting.
It's, that's not how it works.
It's like a Nate.
Correct.
I will say though pineapple on pizza, it's still morally wrong.
Disgusting.
Yeah.
Like it is morally, objectively, ethically disgusting.
Now an apple on pizza.
That's my stance.
Fight me.
It's pretty reprehensible.
I got to say, I mean, it tells you a lot about the character.
They're probably a garbage human.
I'm with the puppets on this one.
Yep.
Anyway, let's see where this goes.
Oh yeah.
There's a way to keep a conversation.
What time is it for you?
133.
It's 132 for me.
Oh yeah.
Within a second to be fine.
Yeah.
All right.
Betful and prevent it from turning into an argument.
And it's this, when you disagree with someone state your opposing
opinion, instead of attacking theirs, you know, that comic that just let
people enjoy things one, well, that goes for the opposite too.
People are allowed to dislike something you like and you're very much
allowed to think I like that position.
So I hate this.
Oh, we might be talking about different things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When what I'm talking about is the whole you're, if you're disagreeing,
you're not allowing them to have an opinion.
Quit that.
Oh, right.
Oh, so you win that fucking bullshit.
I'm sick of hearing that I'm sick of hearing this garbage nonsense because you
hear it all the time it pops up.
Let people enjoy things.
It's like, first off, I don't have the, I don't have the ability to take away their
enjoyment.
I don't have that kind of power.
And I'm not saying that they can't feel this way.
Me saying that they're wrong is not saying that they cannot be wrong.
Well, you're not saying some feelings are wrong when you make an odds of, because
your feelings, how can your feelings be wrong?
You know what I mean?
Like your feelings are what they are.
I don't know.
I want to push back a little bit on what you're saying there, Rags, because if
someone says they like something and it's really bad and you dislike it because
it's bad and you explain why, I think even like it takes usually, usually on
average, I find when you explain bad and stuff like that, you can diminish the
enjoyment someone else is having in something by explaining how bad it is.
And they're like, Oh, wow.
You kind of know what you're doing is you're convincing them of
something you're not forcing anything on.
Yeah.
You've convinced them that it's bad, which is why freedom to listen to you or not.
Yeah.
My, my additional use on it is that achieving that changing their opinion on
something is that they now dislike it where they liked before is not a bad
thing.
I actually find it a good thing that people's standards are raised to appreciate
better quality because that encourages better quality things being made overall.
And so I feel it's a net good, you know, even if you try and say that because of
what I've done, I've reduced someone's enjoyment in something through the, even
through their own acceptance of, uh, the argument I forward, they didn't now
dislike it, uh, that's like, people seem to assume that the lack of enjoyment
people now have in bad quality things is a bad thing because people's enjoyment is
less than just like, no, I would rather people enjoy good things, not bad things.
Yeah.
I think, um, I think the view would be that it's, it would be preferable if
people's point of reference for good content was aligned with, uh, you know,
what we just, what is better quality, uh, content, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
And if, if, if, especially if the goal here is to increase the quality of media,
then yes, then you should raise the standards of what people enjoy.
Unfortunately, and this is kind of the big issue is that they know more choose
to not enjoy it than I can choose to make them enjoy it.
So neither of us beliefs are not a choice.
You don't choose what you believe.
They are the result of things.
And if you can convince somebody of something, that's no more
your choice than it is theirs.
That's just the results of arguments made and experiences had and the way
that people's brain processes, all that information.
So can you make people do things?
It's like, it's kind of like saying, can you make people offended?
Plus when you, when you convince someone that something is bad, that
something is of poor quality, uh, the more people, if you've made them more
critical and the more people think that way, the more likely that that is to
influence how things are actually made and you'll get better content as a result.
I mean, look at fucking EA with all the backlash from microtransactions, you
know, each person who, uh, uh, who, you know, lashed back on that was at some
point persuaded by some kind of argumentation or something that
microtransactions are a bad thing.
Well, yeah, there, there's a reason for why everyone, every, every belief that
we hold is based on something, right?
They don't just form in a vacuum.
There's a reason for it.
It doesn't mean it's justified.
It doesn't mean that it has solid footing.
Doesn't mean that it's correct, but there's always a reason for it.
And helping people, we might be getting caught on definitions.
Cause when you say that beliefs aren't a choice, I always feel that there's an
element of choice in it, even if it's based on, you know, things that you're
observing, say a logical argument or facts and stuff like that, or what if
your ultimate, they'll come to it, you choose them to agree with the facts.
Uh, you can't, um, it depends.
How would you define belief?
Well, that that's what I mean.
I think it's coming down to how like, and so belief, I would generally
try and define as a, an opinion you hold in something based on whatever reasons.
And sometimes those reasons are valid.
If they're, you know, more objective, um, things you can observe.
And sometimes the reasons are more, would dare I say subjective.
Um, and even ethereal, you could say, but there are reasons behind belief.
It's, and that can inform the choice of why you believe.
Well, I mean, I think, uh, I think what I, my view isn't just
probably the same as rags.
It's like, if somebody were to say to me, uh, earth is a marshmallow, you
could choose to believe that it's like, but I'd just be lying to you because I don't.
And no, I don't think you get used to believe that.
I think we assume that in the definition of belief, it means that where you've come
to as a result of all these other things, that there's no real rights.
That's the end point.
You didn't choose an alternate end point based on nothing.
If you say, for instance, uh, that like friends, the earth is a marshmallow is
a good example, right?
It's not impossible to believe that the earth is a marshmallow.
It's not, it's not impossible.
Right.
But no one probably, no one believes that because you, as much as you say it and as
much as you try to convince people, they're not going to be convinced.
They're not going to accept that.
Uh, a lot of people believe the earth is flat.
Well, I was going into the earth is flat, but not more
reasonable to believe that the earth is flat than if the earth is a marshmallow.
I would at least it looks flat.
If you're like, you're just too stupid to think about anything else.
It's not necessarily, well, I wouldn't say it's necessary.
A matter of stupidity.
It can be, it could be a matter of ignorance.
I'm serious.
You're right from the beginning to unfold that, you know, the earth is a marshmallow
and you have no reason to question it.
Yeah, it's, it's, it's a matter of ignorance, that intelligence.
I would say the majority seems to have rejected, uh, you know, real
science, uh, to get to that perspective, because
it will be fully aware of, of the same information that we're aware of.
Yeah.
Uh, typically they're surrounded by conventional science and
they've decided to reject it.
Yeah.
Well, every, every flight or throws an individual and they have their own reason.
Oh yeah.
The, the idea is for, for whatever reason, they are legitimately convinced that,
no, the earth is flat.
And this could either be, um, excessive cynicism and information sources and
stuff like that, and over-reliance on, uh, intuition, whatever the reasons may be.
Um, but our, our acceptance of propositions being true is not something
that we can flick on and off like a switch.
Um,
Gee, I don't know.
See, I always feel there's a element of choice in just by the fact that so
many people in the world choose to, um, believe things that you can argue and
argue and understand all the facts you can and stuff like that, prove them
wrong, objectively in a, in an argument, and they choose not to accept it because
of whatever by confirmation bias or whatever they have.
Well, the only person who would, the only person who knows certain for a
certain, if they actually believe it is them, whether or not they act like it is
another thing, but in a sense that you could say to somebody, um, just like if
I told anyone here in this call to, all right, if belief is a choice that you
could just turn on and off, then just believe gravity isn't real.
And you could say that you don't believe it in it anymore.
And you can maybe act like it to others, but you're not going to be able to just
stop believing that gravity is a thing.
Which is still a choice, I would say.
And the reason why you're choosing not to stop believing is because
of the overwhelming evidence.
No, no, no, no, no, no, you, you, you accept it, but that's not a, that's not
an affirmative actual choice that you are taking consciously, right?
You can't just decide, I am no longer going to believe that gravity exists.
You can become convinced of it, but your belief in that being a true proposition
is going to be the results of the information that you have, your ability
to justify it, your experiences and how those are explained to you and other factors.
It's not like you feel, yeah, but I feel all those things you just mentioned.
Need to be accepted through choice.
No, they can be whether or not they will, I would say no, mostly no, at least you
can do things that will influence the information that you're given, right?
You can put yourself in scenarios and you can surround yourself with people and you
can put yourself in certain environments where certain kinds of information
will be given to you, right?
So if you were dead set, if you, if you believe the earth is flat and you believed
in it 100%, but there was a part of you that was concerned that you might be wrong,
then the, then yeah, if you wanted to avoid going to space museums and you
wanted to avoid learning about aeronautics and you never talked to astronauts and
you never went to any of this stuff, right?
You never went to work in these, any of that.
Sure.
To a degree, you can control the chance of that information being given to you.
For instance, if you never ever talked about it, if you never went into learning
about it, then yeah, sure.
But that would be a choice.
That's not the belief you would be choosing whether or not you would be
influenced by things that could cause you to believe otherwise.
And I was going to say like, maybe as an example, this could possibly help, but
let's just say a wizard came up to me and said that one of you four has killed a
person and I have to try and figure out who do I believe it is.
I know it's true, but it's only one of you four.
I'd be like, I have to guess based on everything I know.
Shared has the most weapons.
Well, not an answer to the thing, right?
That has the most lethal weapons.
I don't think weapons would really sway me much because I think all of you could
get access to anything that could help kill somebody.
Sorry, what's the, what's the, what's the question you had?
I'm quite a missed it.
No, so the premise is that I've been told by a wizard that one of you is a killer
and I've been asked, which one do I believe it is?
And I'm going to probably think about it for a while, weigh up some.
Well, I mean, that's almost like step two because you'd have to, so like, I'd be
like, okay, um, let's say, let's say for the simplicity sake, shadows, access to
weapons, but ethically, I don't believe you would, I don't believe ethically any
of you would kill anybody, but could I believe that any of you could be drawn
to based on some kind of altercation or a thing I'd have to, have to weigh it up.
And eventually I'd be like, let's say I made a choice to this wizard.
He'd be like, you believe us, this person, I'd be like, based on the fact that you
told me that one of them definitely did, and I'm limited here in terms of my
resources, I do believe it's that person.
And it turns out I could be right or wrong or something.
And so could it be argued there that I made a choice to believe somebody or that
I believe that it was that person the whole time and I've explained my reasoning.
Uh, yeah, I mean, I think, um, I think it's just, uh, when we think about the, the
idea of like, what is it that you think, I suppose it's like, uh, could I ever trace
back a point where I like the point where I realized that oxygen was a thing?
You know what I mean?
Like, I don't think I could trace back to any point where I had, I was presented in
my mind with the choice, it's real or it's not.
And I was like, no, it is real.
And that's my position is it's, it's like a position that you reach organically.
And it's, it's, um, and I guess it might be tended to the whole free will thing as
well, but that's a really big rabbit hole.
Even with what you put, like, for instance, I choose to accept evidence that is more
substantive than other evidence and then agree with what that evidence indicates.
And so you might be saying, I am forming my belief organically based on evidence,
but there was an original choice in the way that I structure or the way how, how
I structure my beliefs, I like that example.
Um, cause I guess the, the instance would be like, so if we're in court and we have
to decide on whether or not somebody's guilty of a crime and they present a whole
bunch of evidence, let's take two jurors.
So we got one juror who is only concerned about the facts.
Like he is a facts man.
And we got another juror who is, you know, she's a, or he or she
inclusive.
Were you about to say she only cares about feelings?
If you're going to bring, if you're going to be inclusive, he, she like black, white,
all right, let's go with they.
So they, all of them.
Um, okay.
Let's, let's go with, so all right.
They're both women.
All right.
So she, so there's one woman who is concerned only with the facts.
And there's one woman who is mainly concerned with like, um, I guess how, how,
you know, there's sort of gut feeling that she has about this.
And I don't even really think that gut feeling is like invalid.
If you know what I mean, like, I think that there's a, I think that there's a
reason why we have a gut feeling.
Yeah.
But, uh,
it's essentially based on evidence that you haven't thought about as hard.
Yeah, potentially.
Yeah.
So, um, maybe, maybe gut feeling gut feeling is intuition.
It's based on, uh, your previous experiences and the, the biases you've
further down the rabbit hole.
We go originally about, um, if it's, so this is why I made sure I made sure to
say the beginning that all those videos going to be a vehicle, that means we're
going to go other places from, sorry.
I, uh, I, there was a little, there was a little bit more to that one.
So, so yeah, we go, we got our two jurors.
One of them, she's all facts and the other one she's all feelings.
Um, now, you know, whether, regardless of what conclusion they reach, why is it
that, uh, one of them is really facts driven and one of them is really feelings
driven, was that a choice that they made to choose to be facts driven or feelings
driven, or was there a whole set of things that happened?
Well, I mean, it's three minutes away from, do we have free will very close to
the question though, I think that what Fringey was getting at was that those
two people had arrived at what work essentially worked for them.
They're your brains are like information processes, processing machines.
And as we get older and as we learn, and as we get more experienced, that machine
gets changed, hopefully for the better in what information it will accept and what
information it weighs against the other information that's gone through the
machine in the idea is that you normally start when, when you're a kid, you start
with the basic, you start really simple and is as you, as you get older and older
and older, all that information, you know, it's, it's built up and it's built up
and you can handle better systems and better processes.
And I think, I think there's an analogy now, actually, let's, let's think about
it like, uh, like who you are is a big Jenga tower and you set up your, and the
blocks get set up and they get set up differently depending on, I dunno, sort
of what direction you head in, whether or not, I dunno, you had parents who are
really facty, sciency people, or whether or not you had a bad experience at, uh,
you know, when you're a kid at school, a million, yeah, a whole bunch of variables
and they start getting stacked and they just get stacked one by one.
And then, you know, 20 years later, you end up with two people who have totally
different looking, you know, one of them might be a castle, one of them might be
like a Burj Khalifa skyscraper and they just got there and you don't know how
they got there, like you can look at the individual pieces, but you can't exactly
figure out what, what, whether it was because they happened at a certain
sequence or whether or not they were arranged in a certain way, just, I dunno,
as a, just because of the way that your life went.
And then you end up with two totally different people with totally different
belief systems or, you know, different, uh, moral positions or whatever.
And it's like, it's the sum of a whole bunch of little parts.
And maybe those little parts were influenced by choice, but what you ended
up with was totally outside of your control.
It just happened.
Sure.
You can influence it to a degree, but the things that you influence will
ultimately give you the result of what you accept is true.
What convinces you as part of the machine process that you hopefully
honed to be better and better over time.
See, I feel that there's an element of choice as to determining what that
machine process is for each individual.
Some, uh, maybe, yeah, maybe.
Um, I guess it depends on, uh, uh, sorry, I'm, I'm having a
hand on the wheel, but ultimately where it goes is not entirely up to you.
Like you can, you can take certain actions to maybe lead yourself.
This is definitely the free will.
This is definitely this part is the, well, assuming that we can have
free, whether or not we can, let's, let's just, let's assume we don't have
a choice and we have to have free for this conversation that you, it would
be like we can, if you wanted to, um, I think the analogy of the flat
earth was fairly good.
Like if, if you accepted that the world was flat and you believe that truly,
and you never talked to anyone about it and you never tried to
learn anything about it, then yeah, the chances of you continuing to accept
that as true are going to be a lot higher than someone who really wants
to put it to the test and does the legwork to learn all the information.
That part is the choice, whether they went out and looked, that's up to them.
But the result is not going to be their choice.
No, no, I think the result can very much be choice intended because people can
choose not to agree with all the argument and the evidence you put
forward and stuff like that.
Um, I guess the thing is, is, uh, I guess what we mean by that, or at least
I think what you mean by that is, um, so we have a person who is a flat
earth, um, and maybe they haven't really got a bunch of arguments for it.
And then you just dump a whole bunch of facts in front of them.
You got pictures of earth, you got, you know, you got mathematicians
explaining how it works.
And yet for some reason they're still like, nah, I'm not convinced.
I don't know if it was a choice for them to say that they're not convinced.
I think they are earnestly unconvinced.
No, I do believe choices can happen subconsciously, but like, well, if I get
choices by many opinions and biases and stuff like that, and you might not
be overtly thinking I'm choosing because I want to, but I think, um, uh, every
single, uh, viewpoint you have is ultimately a type of choice.
No, um, I think it might just be a difference of, um, how, because if your
view is that it's subconscious, then we might actually like agree in, like
impracticality, but maybe it's difference in terminology.
Well, if it's subconsciously, I don't think it's a choice.
You don't, you don't choose what you subconsciously do.
However, I'm not sure that, that you do choose what you subconsciously do.
Yeah.
If it, that's the whole thing about being, yeah, of it being
subconscious is that you are not actively making the decision to have those things.
That's one is one that I'd like to think about more.
Um, because yeah, this is the definition of subconscious, uh, of, or concerning
the part of the mind of which one is not fully aware, but which
influences one actions and feelings.
Yeah.
Um, so I guess, and the example is my subconscious fear, which is probably
a good one because you don't really choose to be afraid of something.
Yeah, exactly.
That's, that's a, your subconscious affects you, but it isn't
something that you have control over.
Oh, I think it's something you can control.
I guess what I'm saying is that you can have subconscious biases that can
affect a choice you make without being aware of it.
And you can, you can deliberately try to alter your subconscious biases
by looking like up information.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what I was going to say.
You can learn how to shape it, but it's almost like you don't control the product.
You just control the guiding of it.
Yeah.
It's not all internal biases that they want to have because they look up
information that they want to believe.
Yes.
Yes.
That's probably a good example.
And, and people can still like, people can still believe things contrary to,
um, what they might, a good example would be, let's say someone is born and they
have very racist parents, right?
The parents are very, the parents really don't like, I don't know,
Peruvians or whatever, I hate Peruvians, right?
Scum.
So you grow up, your parents hate Peruvians, your parents, friends hate
Peruvians and they fill your mind with all these idea that Peruvians are terrible.
Right.
And then, you know, you leave the house, you get out in the world, you go to
college, you meet people, you meet Peruvians, they're like, Hey, these people
are, are, are kind of nice.
And there's a part of you that's like, Oh, but you know, this whole, it's almost
like indoctrination, right?
How do you fight this, this thing that's been drilled into your head, even though
you know, you shouldn't hate Peruvians are still a part of you that goes, Oh,
but yeah, you know, that stuff that I've been told for my whole life, it's
kind of like that knowing you shouldn't believe it, but still accepting it as
true anyway, it's really, it's really interesting.
Yeah.
Um, what, what a great segue.
It's very related to what it's talking about, which is the initial premise of
can you convince someone to like something?
That even happens though, in whatever context he provides, we've got a deal
of person A and person B, person B likes X, person A starts espousing positions
on the content that changes person B's mind.
It's like, so what happened was person B stapled down to the fucking floor.
Like you can, you can, you can leave.
So the idea that it's like, Oh, you've fucked up my feelings now.
I'd be like, you came here.
Like I was, so if, so if the conversation starts with like, shat, if you say, you
know, I hate Lord of the Rings and I'm like, what the hell?
And you go, Hey, wait, wait, man.
Like, you know, that's just, that's how I feel about it.
I know that that's unpopular, but like, honestly, I don't really want to talk about it.
I'd be like, okay.
You started it.
Well, the thing is right.
No, I actually do have to give some people warning.
If they say they like the last Jedi and when I asked me what I think about it, I
have to say, Oh, look, I hated it.
And you might not want me to talk about it if you like the movie, because if you,
because I kind of do understand the perspective that some people want to keep
enjoying something and I have the potential to ruin it for them with some
solid arguments and, and so that, but the, the flip side to that is that I don't
necessarily want them to like it if it's legitimate bad.
And so I think it's why they're afraid of that kind of having that conversation
with like people like us.
I mean, I think that, I think that a lot of people know that if they get it, if
they, let's say they love the last Jedi.
There's a lot of people who probably know that if they really sit down and talk to
people like us about it and we go over it for all the reasons, they know they've
got this quote unquote fear that they're going to stop liking it.
And it's not just a thing they can, Oh yeah, well, I'm going to like it anyway.
It's a, it's a funny one because it's sort of, it's sort of affirms that, uh,
whether or not you agree with the objectivity subjectivity as defined by a
lot of the people on EFAP, the framework for argumentation seems to be pretty
solid if at least, if it still results in the same outcome, which is you not liking
it after hearing about all of the problems, quote unquote, you know, the
subjective problems as it were.
I was on, um, Geeks and Gamers stream, right?
And a lot of them was just casually saying like episode three of Mandalorian was the
best one, best, best, best, best.
And I was like, is anyone here heard the perspective that it's not the best one out
of the three?
And then they were like, not really.
No, no.
And I was like, Oh, well, I don't think it's the best one out of the three.
They were like, they asked me for like, just, just, you know, any problems I had.
It's like, okay, well, and I just gave the, um, the one where, you know, he looks in
through the wall and he hears the most important piece of information he could
hear to get him motivated to go inside the building.
And I was just like, seemed pretty convenient.
And the second I said that a lot of them were like, Oh yeah.
Oh, you know, like they all recognize that's a flaw and now my feelings are
starting to change, but like, I'm always in the position of like, uh, my feelings
may change, so be it, you know, if someone, if, if, if all four of you came at me with
Lord of the Rings is terrible, I'm like, go for it.
Well, this is, there is those individuals who can actually acknowledge
something as bad and still like it.
Um, it seems like so many people think that if they like something, it has to be
good because they like it.
And, and if you prove it to be bad, you know, for very strong objective reasons,
then they're like, Oh, that means I don't like this.
Oh, you can still like it.
Yeah.
I think, uh, I think a good example would be, uh, I think Venom is a piece of shit
movie, but I, I thoroughly enjoy it.
I like to laugh at it.
Another good one, I thoroughly enjoyed to recognize the difference between the two
things, because a lot of people, if they don't think about it, they probably lump
those two things as the same thing.
Like in having it be good quality.
No, no, no.
We're not going to change anything.
We're just going to say just, those are just two separate things.
They're not the same clump that you've put them in or that you haven't cared to
separate yet, but the thing is, uh, I often hear people say, I'm pretty sure
I've heard Alo say it to another videos where he's like, I'm sure it's really
good.
I'm just not that interested.
It's like, do you see what you just did there?
Do you see exactly what you just did there?
You recognize that it's still probably of high quality.
You just are not interested.
So we can separate it.
Also, yeah, it was not having an interest in pursuing something and then
actively disliking it when you try it, even though it's good.
Sure.
But, um, it was a new draft extreme as I just wanted to make sure I clarify that.
And I don't know if all of their positions were that the third is the best
in case I misrepresented anything.
It's just that that conversation happened at all.
Got to cover, cover, cover your ground.
You know, make sure I didn't piss anyone off there.
Yeah.
Uh, should we, should we continue with this video?
We've been talking about if you wanted to say something else, this is
the Efap ringing, you've got time.
Uh, I'm not sure.
I think it was, um, I think it's, uh, cause I often say that deep down, nobody
really believes that there's such a thing as that all like he's got footage
of our Skyward sword and I know that a lot of people don't like Skyward sword,
but are we going to pretend like Skyward sword is equally as good or bad as
Custer's revenge?
Are we really going to do that?
Like, like we honestly got to pretend that they're exactly the same.
You saying like the hate for Skyward sword might be hyperbolic to a
point where you know, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What I mean is, um, maybe I'll use a better example.
So let's take breath of the wild, which is pretty widely regarded as one of the
best games of the decade, um, which I think is fair cause there's a lot that
that game does really well.
Are we going to pretend that breath of the wild is as good or bad as Custer's
revenge? Does anybody really believe that truly?
The room versus a lot of people used to say the room versus the dark night
would often be the, uh, comparison.
Oh, the dark night is quite flawed though.
Well, this is the same heads.
Why I said what people would often compare.
Um, some people believe the last Jedi is the best.
Oh, yes.
They do.
But what, what I mean is, uh, are people going to, you know, let's, uh, I
don't know if you don't medicate your kids, they'll be healthier.
Well, it's, it's just the general position that, um, I think everybody
recognizes to some extent quality and lack of quality.
Um, and that's, that's sort of like a subconscious thing.
You know, it's like how people say Zelda's a great series and everybody just says it.
And it's like, well, there's gotta be a reason for that.
Why is it that pretty much everybody says it's a great series?
And why is it that, well, they like it, but there's got to be something else
besides just liking it because a lot of people like stuff that isn't that good.
Like Transformers, like the Michael Bay movies.
It's like, well, there's got to be something so widely accepted as bad.
That's an interesting thing to look into.
Actually.
I might like even, I don't know, well, video on it.
It's like, why is it that there are some things that are so widely accepted as
good and some things that are so widely accepted as bad today?
It would still, it wouldn't be like, Oh, no, it's just bad.
It would be like so widely debated.
I think it only got its reputation as being awful is because it came
up before all of this shit.
Well, something that I find is interesting to try and understand also very
difficult is that there are more like overtly objective things that you can
gauge something's quality by and, and that's what I think a lot of the angle
of that, um, I guess judgment, you know, we take here on eFap about like, for
instance, consistency and stuff like that is a really strong one.
But then I also feel that there's actually another, like almost lay out
a deeper layer that's more ethereal and harder to quantify, um, to determine
something, something's quality for, and I always look to Twilight as my
example, because Twilight is universally panned as being horrible.
Yet it's insane success in, when I see that the, like informs me that it's
doing something right and if you could nail down what that something is, even
though harder to try and define and, and this is again, if you look at
transformers, it's still transformers is wildly popular and successful.
And maybe it's actually not too complex.
Maybe I'm giving it too much credit trying to find out what is it doing right?
That's making so many people like it.
And maybe it is the number of explosions.
And I think it's, uh, I think, I think that those two are good examples of
tapping into certain innate things that people find satisfying.
That's called a duty.
It won't, yeah.
Even if the connective tissue is really bad and transformed into big explosions.
And there's a surface level kind of feedback to a lot of things in terms
of the senses, you know, what we see, what we hear.
Um, and so if you can, oh yeah, if you could get that, if you could tap into
that, then you don't need much beneath the surface because people get that
enjoyment from something that's kind of superficial in a lot of ways.
Yeah.
There's a lot of people who like, remember when the Twilight things were in
full swing, man, those were, they may, all the Twilight fans, all the, all the,
what's the new one?
The, uh, the gray, uh, the sex one.
The gray sex one, the gray sex one, but man, they, uh, there's a lot of people
love that a lot of people do a lot of chicks.
I think we, I think we know why the, this, there's such a disconnect with that one.
It's the most obvious thing is like the demographic that it's for clearly likes
it for a very specific reason, and you don't need to explain it.
No.
For, for, for in our, in, in sexuality, in terms of what we find, um, sexually
attractive is, is a good thing.
You know, he, it doesn't matter how deep it is.
Well, no, I mean like, uh, in terms of, uh, you know, I'm genuinely asking.
Huh?
I'm genuinely asking, could you, could you make, could you do something?
Is there like, are there standards in porn that could be?
Define pornography.
And I guess I suppose if it's, if it's shot in a way that you just can't see
what's happening, but that's like the only standard, what if you can hear, what
if you like that?
Yeah.
What if that's what people like that?
I don't want to see, you know, people who get, you know, people
like to get blindfolded as well.
It's that, uh, it's too broad.
There are poor crafts.
There are crafts within born as in like, it's like you're saying they
craft a filmmaking and then we can reference.
Okay.
So like a script writer, a director, editor, like, which we, you know, you
find it funny, but there's no production to porn.
There's a difference between highly produced and lowly produced porn.
Everyone knows this.
Guys, I'm a good Christian boy.
I mean, I thought when I, I like different levels of quality of porn.
Well, I guess like, um, if once we get a definition for pornography, then we
will have a standard by which to judge something as whether or not it meets
those criteria.
Well, do the Transformers movies meet the expectation of what
they were trying to achieve?
Oh, probably, probably what they were trying to achieve.
Sure.
If, if the quality of the, if we want to use the standard of, you know, X and
if it's Transformers meets that, then yeah, it's objectively good.
I would say they're trying to tell a story and the plot I think is fairly
incoherent for quite a few of them.
So they failed at that.
I don't even know how many there are now.
There are six, uh, six, I was going to guess seven, seven, uh, there's, uh,
there's Transformers, Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen, which is terrible.
Like much worse.
Transformers ducks of the moon.
I think that one's really bad.
Age of Extinction, which is the worst one.
I, okay.
I couldn't watch that one like all the way through.
I don't even know the difference.
It's like the, it's like all the pirates movies after the first one.
They just blend together.
Dead men tell no tales of stranger ties.
Literally a guy essentially talked to camera whites about why it's
okay for him to bang a 17 year old.
Oh, that's, uh, that's Age of Extinction.
Yeah.
He literally printed off and laminated a section from a piece of legislation
that says it's okay for him to be going out with a 17 year old.
It's just like, what the hell is this?
I mean, the age of consent is 16 in a lot of places here.
I don't know why you have to like laminate.
Because, because Michael Bay has to justify doing what he did.
Yeah.
Michael Bay fucked a 17 year old.
No, it's that Michael Bay.
It's Michael Bay.
It's a Nickelback fucked a 17 year old.
Michael Bay has put in only a 17 year old would fuck Nickel.
Well, it's because Michael Bay, again, he's, he's not very subtle director.
You know, he always has our shots and things.
And it's like, it's always like he has to justify that.
It's like, this is allowed.
This is legal.
He chose to, but that's the thing.
He chose to make his character 17.
What's the act of 17?
She's a hold on.
I'm going to double check.
No, it strikes me as the reason they would have that in there.
Oh, yeah, that does make sense.
I guess.
So Transformers age of extinction came out in 2014.
Let's assume that it was filmed in 2013.
Uh, so she would have been like 18 when it was being shot.
I don't know what, like, I don't get it.
Like, I don't get it.
Come back out now.
Like, it's so good.
That movie is terrible.
And then they did Transformers the last night where it's like, Oh, the
Transformers met up with like King Arthur and Mel.
Oh yeah.
I was about to ask.
Is that the one where they're like, apparently they transform into
Trebuchets or some shit.
It's like Transformers and King Arthur.
And I was like, nah, I'm at first.
Well, the thing is they keep, they keep right conning the law.
Cause in the first Transformers movie, that was the first time they came to
earth in the second one.
It's like, no, they built the pyramids 10,000 years ago.
And the third one, nope, they were on the moon, and then in the fourth one,
it's like, nope, they killed the dinosaurs.
It's a cup.
And then it's like, nope, transformer started the big bang.
You're like, Oh, okay.
Transformers created the universe.
So anyway, so Zelda.
Again, I don't know.
I don't know if you want to use the, the, the contention.
Like I said is you're ruining people's feelings by fucking addressing their
expression of their feelings or something like that, right?
We'll, we'll roll him back.
There's no way we're going to get through more than 20 seconds.
I'm not pausing again, but we will give it a shot.
I go ahead and hold that for one moment.
Let me use the loo and you can talk about, I don't know.
I'll, I'll also take advantage of that.
Yep.
I'll just say that was a glorious and deep tangent.
It was wonderful.
That is an Efap tangent right there.
That was probably one of the biggest tangents we've ever had.
It was a team.
We got into the nature of agency and belief, which by the way, every
conversation, every argument will eventually come down to philosophy, right?
That's pretty much like how it always works.
You, you keep drilling until you eventually get down to fundamentals.
This pause has lasted for 36 minutes, by the way.
That's it.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Yeah, we got to develop rookie numbers.
The pause before that though, lasted 30, 37 to 40, the pause
before that was 10 minutes.
So, you know, we've, we've had one, we've played the video once
in the last 46 minutes.
It's because the thing is like, this is just not a topic that's
going away anytime soon.
My favorite thing is when people accuse Efap of being like content
parasites, they just take up people's content because they can't make
their own parasites.
You don't even like remember what the content they were covering was.
We've, we've played more like three seconds of video in 40 minutes.
There are some, the, the Jenny backlash thing was interesting to observe.
Oh, was it just people having no idea what Efap is.
Just not understair yet.
I think, uh, oh, sorry.
I missed all that.
What were you just saying?
How the hell did you miss everything?
And then slab a door and go, well, I think I was, I was, I was, I didn't
catch all of it.
I caught the end of it.
Were you having a conversation with yourself?
No, I wasn't.
I was putting on my headset and I was like, Oh, what's this?
What's happening?
And then I like got up and closed the door.
All right.
Uh, well, I mean, I don't know.
What were we talking about?
Oh, I was just, it's a side comment that I was making that I found the whole
Jenny backlash interesting about people not understanding Efap at all.
I tried to comment on what it's all about.
And it's just like, just wait for a dude.
I'll put on a Twitter thing saying they spent 10 hours on my video.
What the fuck.
By the way, Brooks has since posted another tweet that he's again deleted.
Just stop, man.
Oh, was it the one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know.
He's got one up there.
He's got one up there calling me and my fans vultures, which
is still up for some reason.
Um, okay.
That he's got obvious.
Yeah.
Does he see a way that vultures typically go after what's already dead?
I'm trying to imply something there.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't disagree with him.
It's a tweet where he's thanking literally the person who was defending him singular.
Oh, he's a little good on them.
His wife wouldn't defend him.
She knows.
I remember everyone knobs is married, so don't worry.
There you can do it.
No, his wife is 3d.
I'm sure they get along very well.
I've never seen her.
It just keeps saying she's Asian.
And that's the kind of thing he would say about it.
I'm certain that she is in that house voluntarily and she wouldn't
escape if the doors became unlocked at all.
Sure.
They have a very happy relationship.
Probably quite a lot of money in that house.
Is there
probably as possible.
Yeah, I don't know.
Social blade by the way, sign the petition.
I don't want to look at anyone's social.
Anyway, you guys want to keep going social blade right now.
Yeah, let's keep going.
Let's just do it.
In opinion, instead of attacking theirs, you know, that comic that just let
people enjoy things.
One, well, that goes for the opposite, too.
People are allowed to dislike something you like, and you're very much allowed
to disagree with all their opinions.
But when instead of saying, I'm sorry, I was wrong.
So Brooks is a monthly, no, sorry.
Brooks, yearly estimated earnings are, oh, no, nevermind.
I was reading the lower estimate, thinking it was the higher one.
Nevermind.
He makes a possible 5K to 90K a year.
That's that's that's an amount.
5K to 90K.
Things are so inaccurate.
Just I could have guessed that.
Well, no, it's it's definitely going to be somewhere within that range, but I'm
pretty sure it's going anywhere between zero and one year.
Although it probably doesn't take into account how much he gets demonetized
because there's no way he doesn't get demonetized a lot.
His channel name has literally got shit in it.
In the video, in the title of my video with two of the letter censored.
So yeah.
Yeah, going back to what the video was saying, it really seems like it's trying
to say don't challenge anyone's opinions, but even if they dislike and like it,
just let them have their opinions.
So therefore nothing can be falsified.
Look at the framing of the comic, though.
You seem to be.
It seems to be this like friend who's just sitting next to a guy who's
watching football and says, how stupid is and then he's like, shush, let people enjoy stuff.
Um, how, who's the one being censored here?
Who's the one being stupid?
The thing is what?
But like, do you know what I mean?
Like the logic is, hey, let people have feelings.
It's like, hey, let the bad speak.
You should be allowed to do that.
Right.
Let him enjoy pointing out how stupid stuff is because that can be really fun.
I don't even like, I don't know.
It seems, it seems to go in a little bit too far with this for me.
I'm like, how fragile are you?
What if I enjoy tearing down your things that you know, it's like if somebody came
up to me and said, video games are fucking shit and you're shit for liking them.
It's like, okay, I don't know.
I like him a lot.
You're not going to convince me otherwise.
Again, with the context, like if this is a good friend of mine, I'd be like,
video games are shit.
Why?
What do you, what's, what's your case?
It is a random dude at like some party you're at where you're just trying
to see the game or something.
It's like, you know why video games are terrible?
I'd be like, why?
Oh yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
Like this is, this is overly defensive.
Yeah.
It's if someone told me that I'd be like, hi, yeah, you bet.
I'd love to hear that.
But if someone knocked, if the FBI knocked on my door with a massive pile
of papers and said, sit down, I think your father's actually a serial killer.
I'd be like, Oh fuck.
It's like,
my dad is a serial killer.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
I probably shouldn't have started that out with in the FBI is knocking on my door.
Well, that goes for the opposite too.
People are allowed to dislike something you like, and you're very much
allowed to disagree with all their opinions.
Is it another way of saying this legal or a morally right?
I don't know.
Just saying aloud.
What does he mean when allowed?
It's like, when someone's like, no.
We've actually, we've actually regressed in the video.
We've gone backwards.
We have.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, we'll get there.
We're getting there.
There's just lots of interesting.
This is the thing.
You can't have this topic without branching out every way.
Cause this is like fundamental shit.
And you know how he began this?
It was pretty obvious.
Is it so that's the same thing that flat earthers say.
Oh, it's obvious you're a flat.
I mean, look, do you have space rags?
I don't think so.
My favorite flat earth argument is people saying if the
earth is moving, why are the still?
You can't, you can't answer that.
Somebody in the comments said that the author of the comic of Let People Enjoy Things has
said that he doesn't actually like that comic.
He doesn't like making it.
Why would he let people enjoy his comic?
Why can't he let himself enjoy making his comic?
Let yourself enjoy because you can't just refuse to like things.
I do like the idea of like, you're, you know, you're allowed to disagree with people.
I like the idea of, you know, the disagreement.
Police busting down on the ground, if you want, I guess maybe.
Yeah, it makes you feel better.
It's all right.
It seems contradictive to a person.
He says, I like cheese.
Next guy says, oh, she sucks.
And then that guy's like, hey, don't do that.
Like, person C is like, leave that guy alone.
And then person D is like, hey, person C, leave person B alone.
He's just sharing his opinion.
There's some other guys like, hey, person D leave person C alone.
You know what I mean?
Like, it just goes on forever.
You know, very easy shit.
Will we have a decide if cheese is morally good?
Cheese is literally shit.
In his defense, it seems like he's trying to say, you know, people who dislike
something aren't bad people.
They're allowed to.
Yeah, which I agree with.
That is not a hot take.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, he's coming at this so far from a very long, confrontational.
This is the thing.
Like I'm viewing what he said as the, uh, the, the, the sort of, when
somebody says, I love that movie.
That's just viewed as okay and positive.
But if somebody says, I hated that movie.
It's like, God, why are you so opinionated?
Why are you such a dick?
Yeah, yeah.
Which is, that's, that's just like people, let people like things.
So if he's, yeah, no, go ahead.
I was basically done to, to steel man his point.
Um, I'd essentially interpret this as a, Oh, when someone says, says they
dislike something that you like, it's not a personal attack and you
don't have to take it as well.
Do you have to hear?
Yeah, we all agree.
I think it's the thing.
I don't think, um, it's almost like it's an unwritten rule that never gets used.
Like why just the highlighting the hypocrisy, flipping the stakes.
And for some reason we don't really seem to apply it, but that part's fine.
I don't disagree on that.
I don't think anyone would.
So we'll, we'll let him carry on.
There's gotta be something else we can, uh, chew on.
I'm sure of it too.
People are allowed to dislike something you like, and you're very much allowed
to disagree with all their opinions.
But when, instead of saying you feel that way, well, I feel this way, you say you
only feel that way because you such and such you have officially.
No, no, no.
I don't like this framing.
I like this.
I don't like the angry eyebrows and are you all the baby?
Like, no, no, you're, you're, you're, you're poisoning this discussion here.
We've got an example, right?
So, uh, no bullshit's like, Oh my God, I hate this, this movie.
And then, um, there's just loads of women at it.
I'd be like, is it because you only dislike it?
Cause there's loads of women in it.
Yeah.
Here's another example.
Let's say you're playing a multiplayer game.
I was actually, I was playing more and how earlier and there was a guy in the
game is really low level and he's like, man, I'm, I'm having a lot of trouble
learning this game's mechanics and I'm, I'm new.
I have so much to learn.
Right.
And so in the chat we asked him, did you play the tutorial?
And maybe you don't like the, and he said, no.
And he said, maybe you're having a hard time because you
didn't play the tutorial.
Right.
That's not us being like angry eyebrows and maybe fucking dicks to him or anything.
We're just like, maybe you think this because duh, duh, duh.
Maybe your opinion is informed because of this and not the other thing.
Or maybe you're just ignorant about some kind of topic or information.
I think the, uh, the thing is right.
Like if, if we were to say that in the discussion, just inferring
somebody's intense angrily, like, yeah, that's probably not great.
The issue is that you've sort of framed it as though that is the only
way that you can disagree.
Like, you know what I mean?
Like I can attack your argument without saying you only like it.
Cause this or that it's like, ah, come on.
Like we don't have, we just pointed out there, the framing scene, he
seems to be implying that when people disagree, it's either the majority
of people are disagreeing and then, um, assuming people's intentions based
on their, you know, that's the issue.
Well, yeah, you didn't like the last Jedi because you hate women.
But I will say, is it like, you know, what if you have like clean
evidence of someone's preferences that are what you would call morally
objectionable, for example, someone just hates black people and they're
like, I couldn't enjoy black Panther.
And they're like, I think it was just like, that it was stupid.
And then you're like, well, you hate black people.
So it doesn't surprise me that you didn't enjoy black Panther.
You know, would that be a fair statement?
Or is that, is that rude?
I would say that's perfectly valid.
That's fair and rude.
Well, it's, I'm trying to figure out the tension behind someone's opinion
based on certain facts that you know.
And so not just using them of, you don't like this because you're that
you actually have a bit of background knowledge, uh, you know, substantiate.
The thing is I, uh, I, I am sort of of the view that it's probably a good
idea to try and not infer somebody's intent behind their position, because
I think that's where a lot of people go wrong.
They're like, Oh, well you, you must, you know, be this political leading
because you said that and it's like that, come on, you know what I mean?
But, but in this instance, it's the framing of it as though that is, you
know, that is what it means to attack somebody's attack, somebody's position.
You know, as people, and people need to remember that when people have
opinions, they might not even, they, in fact, it probably not uncommon at all.
People don't know why they have the opinions that they do.
So that it's not unreasonable for someone to be like, I think this, but
I can't really articulate why I do.
So you just have to start simple and work through it with them.
Yeah.
This is obviously framed as very attacky and as, as some to have their, uh, uh,
intentions and motivations.
So this is like, okay, so this guy's an asshole.
It's not about the fact that these are disagreed with the via the perspective.
Yeah.
This is the execution of the discussion that the real issue is.
I mean, if you're gonna, if you're going to jump down someone's throat for no
reason, yeah, you're, you're a Dick and you shouldn't do that because if, if,
for purely pragmatic reasons, it's because if you're a Dick to people, they're
going to want to, there's instantly like that barrier that pops up where I
don't want to agree with you and I'm going to treat everything that you're
doing is bad faith and I'm going to value it less because you're being a
douche to me.
And even if I do start to agree with what you're saying, I'm not going to show
it, I'm not going to act like it just out of spite to you.
And I think you can tell this is very informed by the fact that he shared that
he doesn't like the look of the new game online and he's been receiving a lot of
you don't like it because you have a preference for the, uh, realistic
graphics or whatever, which he does.
So it's not even inaccurate.
He does have a, yeah, that's correct.
If he thinks everyone, everything's subjective and someone's like, well, you
just don't like it because of your preferences.
Wouldn't he be like, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, that's true.
Yeah.
You don't like it because of your preference.
Well, that's true.
That's almost like tautological.
He's going to make a couple of arguments.
I remember there are in this video of the, he's just going to criticize
straight up the style at some point.
We will get there.
I feel this way.
You say you only feel that way because you such and such you have officially
and irreparably broken the conversation.
You've turned it into an argument.
You've made it personal.
There's that whole dumb thing that, Oh, you have freedom of speech to state your
opinion.
Well, I've got freedom of speech to criticize that opinion.
Oh, well, then I've got freedom.
That's not dumb.
That's not dumb, but that's true.
Yeah.
I'm fine with that.
Not to mention, um, he said you've broken the thing you've done.
It's like, okay, it's not irreparably damaged.
If someone like straight up says like, you know, argument, uh, counter argument,
argument, counter argument, you're a fucking idiot.
You go, okay.
Can you actually counter the argument?
And then you carry on.
I'd be like, that was a moment of them damaging the conversation to a degree.
Sure.
But you can recover.
It's really on, you know, like to say that it's like, it's all over the second.
You, you imply any kind of personal bias.
Like what?
No, you can carry on.
I mean, it happens to us all the time.
If someone says something like, um, on Twitter, like Mola didn't like Captain
Marvel because he hates female protagonists.
I'll be like, right then.
Like that's a personal attack.
It's implicit that I'm a fucking sexist.
All I've got to do now is provide examples of where I've praised female
protagonists, uh, in film or have favorite examples.
I can do that.
I could choose instead to be like, I'm a sexist.
You've destroyed this argument.
I'm out.
He's also assumed, or he's also trying to state that assuming motive for an
opinion is an attack.
That's kind of what is trying to, uh, yeah, which is not necessarily true.
No, it's not.
No.
Yeah.
It's, it's very, I would never, I would certainly avoid it.
Yeah.
Avoid it.
It can be when you say you just have that opinion because you're an idiot or
because you hate women and stuff.
That's that attack, but not in every instance, if there's actual
reason in, you know, evidence.
Yeah.
Cause, cause imagine if, uh, if somebody said, I don't really like X come too.
And it's like, is that because you just generally don't like strategy games?
There's nothing wrong with that.
Yeah.
That's just asking.
Yeah.
Maybe you, maybe you have a preference that just isn't this genre.
Maybe you, maybe you just don't particularly like the genre.
Maybe other genres of games are for you.
I want to put this to the test.
I want you guys to assume my motive because I'll state something that I
think you'll find interesting.
Sure.
I did not enjoy the joke.
Closeted homosexual
of the apex gay.
Did you actually enjoy the Joker?
I actually, I didn't find it an enjoyable film.
That doesn't mean that I don't think it's a brilliant film.
My first port of call would be, is it because it's a tad, uh, like you
could call it negative.
Yeah.
It's not cathartic.
You like catharsis in your endings.
No, I don't need to.
Look at my titties.
Um, that is true.
Um, why, why wouldn't Shad have really cared for?
Well, wait, what about, what about what I said though?
Just the idea that there's, there's a lot in the film.
It's very, uh, like a downer.
A lot of it's a downer.
Depressing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Like, and I don't, I naturally, uh, you know, uh, it's fair enough myself
to villain characters, like I bet it's hard for me to root for them when
they're doing bad things.
And overall it was a, you know, story of a man becoming a psychopath and stuff.
And so I can't enjoy something like that, but that's not to say it
wasn't brilliantly made.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
So we just assumed a personal bias that may have resulted in your opinion.
How do you feel that we've destroyed this conversation, Shad?
Well, I don't know.
You, you assumed the bias correctly mauler right there.
So, but even though you were corrected that you were attacking me,
you're not saying Joker was bad.
Cause if you'd said Joker was bad, like you thought you thought it
was actually a poorly made film.
And then, you know, we said to you, Oh, you probably just don't like it.
Cause you can't, you can't, you can't, you don't like well-made movie.
Yeah.
I mean, this is definitely, it also depends on the standard that I apply.
If I consider something to be good, but, um, if only if I enjoy it, then I would
have to say the Joker is not a good film because standards that make me enjoy a
film.
Yeah.
Uh, so again, yeah, it depends on the standard.
Whenever you do the intentions, motive thing, always form it in the, always
do the jeopardy and state your motive sensing in the form of a question.
It's like, well, like almost like you're probing them to get them to say it out
loud, to get them to think about it.
Well, maybe it's because this and this, or did you like such and such?
Or did you play the tutorial?
Did you see the movie before this?
Did you read the book?
Do you really like this genre?
Stuff like that, instead of being accusatory, be inquisitive.
I mean, and also, um, uh, any movie that doesn't have swords is already knocked
down a few points in my pocket.
Check out.
So let's say, um, no bullshit on Twitter, man.
What's happening?
Is he does something new?
You're doing well.
It's the thing you responded to when you showed him a picture of the guinea pig.
You should just post him the petition to be like, can you, like, you are
morally obligated to do this?
How it works.
What is it currently?
Um, how?
Copy and paste his souls.
Uh, yeah, guys, uh, this petition is important.
It's going in the chat.
I'm sorry.
Uh, this desperately needs more signatures because knobs, we want to annoy knobs.
Like, that's why you need to sign that.
It will annoy knobs.
We're bad people here on eFap.
We're bad.
We're the worst.
Whenever he tweets anything new, just reply to him with a picture of one of
the guinea pigs from G4.
I can't believe that was a film.
That could constitute harassment of the fucking Tism rules.
Don't, don't harass knobs with your G4 pictures.
Sent him them like out of love.
Yeah.
I was going to say, don't, don't get yourself banned now, Jay, like encouraging
people to spam him gable pictures.
Okay.
Don't do that.
Well, well played, Jay.
He nailed it.
Not officially and him with guinea pig pictures, not wants you to do that.
That would be horrible to repeatedly spam.
I wasn't thinking like that anyone would ever consider being set a picture
of a guinea pig harassment, but I could actually believe that he would say
that the reason why I warn you is because he threatened destiny with like
getting rid of his sponsor.
Like you got to be careful.
Yeah, I guess don't do that.
That was just, that was pretty disgusting.
Not going to lie.
That was a thing is I don't, I don't want to, I guess I don't want to encourage
it, but it was funny when I saw it.
Since I did it without anyone, I saw people doing it with people telling me
to do it without people, without me even suggesting that anyone do it.
I saw people were just doing it to his tweets.
It was funny.
I just find it interesting that some people will hate someone just because
they are friends with someone they dislike, you know, it seems.
I can't believe it happened.
Like I got in trouble for being friends with Jay.
I never thought that would be the case.
Yeah, it's never happened that way around before.
I know.
It's like ultra tribalism.
It's the kind of thing that you want to, you don't, don't think of
everything as an us versus them.
Like I was like, there are times when you're like, Oh, you know, he's
in that group, so he's probably going to, that happens.
That's just being observed, but it was like everything like that.
It's quote.
So she was streamed with more of what is it once?
Yeah, once.
Right.
So he's this one, he's streamed with you once.
And then, uh, nobs was like, uh, and then Jay has said these things that, and
then the list and load of stuff I never said, and then fucking, uh, was like,
yeah, okay, so what's your comment about that?
Since you associate with these people.
I'm like, fucking what?
Yeah.
This is the thing.
I'm pretty sure everybody can be associated with, like how it's like what
Richard Spencer could probably be associated with directly with like
contra points or whatever you can find a line.
In fact, that's not even long.
Sargon.
That's it.
They've both spoken to Sargon.
But isn't that the thing that it's like, there's no one in the world that's
separated by more than like, what, like six degrees of separation or something.
When you say it like that, like, you know, someone, someone, and they've
once had a phone call with someone who.
Most people have met a famous person and that's almost how you can
really find the end sort of thing.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I don't, I don't want to brag guys, but I do know Brandon Sanderson.
Well, I know Shatterversity, so yeah.
Oh, I know no bullshit.
Anyway, let's, let's hear this, this, um, totally fair representation of an
argument, uh, that he's going to put on screen for us.
Irreparably broken the conversation.
You've turned it into an argument.
You've made it personal.
There's that whole dumb thing that freedom of speech to state your opinion.
Well, I've got freedom of speech to criticize that opinion.
Oh, well, then I've got freedom of speech to criticize your opinion
of the person's opinion.
And fuck.
Yeah.
Why is he saying that this is ridiculous?
That's a thing that happens a lot.
All right.
Bring it on.
Bring on the free speech in the same way that you have movie criticism of movie
criticism of the criticism of the movie.
And then with Jenny, we had hordes of people criticizing our criticism
of their criticism of a movie.
That's great.
This happens.
It's fine.
It's okay.
Like, as long as you keep track of all the variables and you focus on what
you're actually talking about, you'll be fine.
It's all important.
It's not like this one fundamental level where whatever you say is just beyond
scrutiny, like, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, I've got freedom of speech to criticize that opinion.
Oh, well, then I've got freedom of speech to criticize your opinion of the
person's opinion and it's this never ending thing and that never ending
garbage-y thing begins with that first criticism.
Why would you want to end?
I mean, there's no people that can loot anything anymore.
I know you want it.
It's just, that's just the way that the world works.
You're never going to run out of arguments.
They will never stop.
Some things will simply never be settled.
Just, you're just going to have to accept it, man.
But, but also there are some arguments that can be settled through,
you know, discussion.
There's always going to be the guy who's not good at the level.
Sure.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
Maybe between like two individuals.
Yeah, absolutely.
But man, this is just going to, people are going to argue.
And they're going to criticize, especially now that we've got the
internet and there's people and it's easy to go after others.
You can't, you lack context.
Like, do I, do I have a problem with the people who are weighing in on like the
criticizes of the people who criticize after that Jenny thing?
It's like, not necessarily.
They see this thing out of context.
It's like the eFap crew rip into women regularly for hours on end.
They're just going to be like, what?
And they have an argument with that guy.
And it's like, don't you realize, dude, you're arguing with someone who's arguing
about a thing that was arguing about a thing that was arguing about a thing.
It's like, there's no point.
This is stupid.
Now it's like, no, it's not.
Why is that stupid?
Like he just described it as garbage.
It's like, no, it's not.
We talk about, they do the journey to criticize your opinion of the person's
opinion, and it's this never ending thing.
And that never ending garbage-y thing begins with that first
criticism of that first opinion.
That whole thing doesn't start if instead of a criticism or a
borrows, you just have to independent.
Right.
But it always has to begin with someone making a claim.
There's a claim.
Again, he's coming back to that thing where you cannot criticize someone's
opinion and again, like, so before you can never falsify someone's opinion.
Every opinion is valid.
If you really believe this, then it's like, likes or whatever.
That's irrelevant because that's a criticism.
That's a judgment of your opinion on something.
So that's irrelevant.
Well, I'm not sure where you're going with this, man.
That's the thing.
Well, he seems to be saying, don't criticize people's opinions because then
leads to an endless argument.
Everyone is endless, it might.
Yeah, indeed, but not really one.
And it's not necessarily pointless.
And I think you need to, uh, qualify it like nearly every statement or opinion
to try and find out what is true.
Like, yeah, I think that's true.
It's like that garbage-y thing is like, man, you think so little of discussion.
That's awful.
I guess he's, uh, well, this is the thing.
Maybe this is me being a cruel mean man, but I think he may have a personal bias
because he's experienced this particular result a lot.
Well, now you're just attacking him all well.
I apologize for that.
I'm sorry.
I was all right.
You've reduced this into an argument instead of a discussion, even though
I'm so sorry.
They got the discussions, can be arguments and arguments aren't necessarily bad.
Criticism of that first opinion, that whole thing doesn't start.
If instead of a criticism or a boros, you just have two independent opinions.
I don't like it.
Like, I understand what he's saying.
You've got these two options.
One where opinion A is stated, opinion B is stated, and we all go home.
The other opinion A is stated.
And then opinion B is a, is a counter of opinion A.
And so opinion A counters opinion B and we go on forever.
Why are these the two options?
Imagine, imagine wanting to convince people that you're correct.
Like the audacity.
Rags, that's, that's, that's wrong.
Your opinion is wrong.
And let me explain to you, rape.
I wouldn't even debate you.
Right.
I wouldn't even debate.
I've noticed it happened a lot on eFap where one of us will say something.
And then if it's very wrong, like for instance, we misquote something,
boys state something that happened in the movie.
It didn't happen.
Cause we got confused.
It was like, no, no, that didn't happen.
And you know what the person does who was wrong.
Okay.
Thanks.
Thanks for the connection.
Like I withdraw my criticism in many times.
And if they feel strong on it, then they'll be like, no, pretty sure it happened.
They'd be like right there to YouTube.
We did it live with the red guy, right?
He was sitting.
There was no, have you seen?
Oh God, no.
Yeah.
I just ago, I don't remember too much.
Oh, well, I mean, you may not remember this then, but he said there was, there
was no face scanner, face making moment in the film where there has been in every
other mission possible.
And we were like, yes, there is.
He was like, no, there's not.
We pulled up the video and showed him and he was like, well, can you be sure that
that's a face making machine?
We were like, yes, we can.
And then he eventually was like, well, he's like, it's not on the screen for very
long though.
Yeah, dude, it was really strange.
It was a very strange moment where we were able to pull up a clip and just
right there, boom, you are clearly, here's it happening.
You could watch it happening.
Like, no, dad's.
I got hit with copyright for that as well.
But while he was worth it, the argument was made.
That's just an example that you can counter opinion and it stops right there when you
counter it with just hard evidence that can't, you know, contradict it.
And that should be fine.
That should be a process that's fine.
Because if he had just said, oh, my mistake, it would just carry it on.
But instead he was like, no.
And then you move the goalpost like three times.
It's never fun.
But, you know, we got through it.
And yeah, I don't know.
I just don't like this dichotomy that Arlo is generating.
Perhaps there is more to this, though.
Let's see.
Yeah, I want this first opinion.
That whole thing doesn't start if instead of a criticism or a boros, you just have two
independent opinions sitting next to each other.
Elaboration back and forth.
A continued discussion.
That's all great.
Yeah.
That can't happen if you start that chain going.
It sounds like people having two separate conversations on their own.
Hang on.
Yeah.
You said elaboration discussion.
That's all great.
But it can't happen if you start that chain.
The elaboration discussion is the chain that he was just talking about.
He said two independent opinions.
It's like, but they're not independent once you start.
You just said to talk about them.
The problem here is totally about how he constitutes attacks, what generates this
dreaded argument to happen.
Yeah.
And his reference was that someone pointed to a personal bias and we've already defined
that that's not necessarily a direct attack.
We've had several examples already, some by accident, but this is confusing, to say
the least.
Yes.
Let's see where he goes.
I would love to ask this person, when is it okay to argue?
When is it okay to debate?
They're just going to express their opinion and then you will express your opinion.
Whoa, that sounds like a good argument.
Careful there.
I think he's clearly defining what an argument is to be incorrect.
I think he believes an argument is when something devolves into personal attacks and
yelling at each other.
Right.
Which is not...
A debate is an argument.
An argument is a debate.
They're quite anonymous.
Yeah.
Also, an argument can have personal attacks.
It also doesn't have to have them.
They're kind of not like the same thing at all anyway.
So it's weird that he did lump them together.
And personal attacks can be interpreted.
They can be delivered with levity or with malice.
Like there's so much to this that complicates everything.
Like you could involve them to have fun.
That's true.
It's a way bigger topic than I think he realizes.
I think it's a bigger topic than anyone really realizes.
Like even me.
Sometimes I'll be like, oh, fuck, now we got to discuss this, about this, about this,
it's like a huge tree.
But fun nonetheless.
It's like a huge tree.
Oh, Ian's sitting next to each other, elaboration.
It took me a second to figure out your metaphor there.
And I was just like, it's like a huge tree.
Yes.
Yeah.
And then I got it.
I'm just like...
Why did you fall to tell us that?
It seemed important to me at the time.
You're a strange man, James.
I mean, John, what's your name?
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey.
Good to have you on again, Jeffrey.
I hiccuped.
You didn't hear it, but I just hiccuped.
I thought you guys should do that.
Whoa.
I'm glad that I'm now not the only one just announcing things.
Independence.
I think that was the point of the show.
I think she had a drink.
And opinions sitting next to each other, elaboration, back and forth, continued
discussion, that's all great.
But that can't happen if you start that chain going.
And sorry, if you do that, even if you think another person's opinion is
closed-minded or whatever, you have made yourself the closed-minded one.
Okay.
So let's, let's not mind it.
Yeah.
You just, yeah, that's what closed-minded people do.
They really love to engage in discussion.
Here's a good example, right?
Uh, so imagine somebody says, um, I don't know, insert race here,
uh, inferior, and you will never change my mind on that.
If I said, wow, that's pretty stupid.
It's like, oh, you're the closed-minded one, even though the other person
literally said that they are closed-minded.
It's like, this is not how it works, man.
Yeah.
He's lost his kind of definitions and point like, you know, as to what arm
causes a thing and cause, uh, you know, it's a bit of a mess at the moment,
unfortunately.
Oh, yes, it is.
Yeah.
I can't say like, there's a lot wrong with that, but, um, I'm going to let him get
further.
If you do that, even if you think another person's opinion is closed-minded or
whatever, you have made yourself the closed-minded one.
Even if you're like 99% sure that other person's opinion was made for what you
feel is a bad reason, it is still not your place to call yourself a mind reader.
And assume that's what he's saying.
He, he believes, um, making any assumption, um, but to figure out why someone holds
an opinion is being closed-minded, which is because I think in the same, I think
he's concluding that if ever I was to challenge, let's say, Shad on his
perspective, I've assumed how he got there and I'm telling him it's wrong, which
is a mind reading thing because I couldn't possibly know, but that's not true.
Depending on what Shad says, like I said, if Shad says his ledger is not in the
dark night, I don't need to know what's in his mind.
He's wrong.
Here's a good example, right?
What if somebody said, I don't like the art style to Wind Waker because I think
it's shit.
And I said, Oh, so you don't like it cause you think it's shit.
It's like, wow, closed-minded mind reader much.
It's like, well, you said it.
I mean, like assuming intentions is like an outgoing thing.
Closed-mindedness is like blocking incoming thoughts.
Like you've closed yourself off to the, uh, to, to, to learning about new ideas
and potentially accepting new idea or putting your, to yourself in a position
to accept new ideas, at least you're closing yourself off.
That has nothing to do with whether you accept or whether you, sorry, um, whether
you are probing other people's intentions or assuming other people's
intentions, those have nothing to do with one another.
You could be very closed-minded and extremely hesitant to think about
other people's, you know, reasons.
Yeah.
I think, I think is trying to say it in the way that if you, um, uh, try and
assume the intent behind someone's opinion to dismiss the opinion, then
that's being closed-minded because you're not trying to acknowledge the opinion.
I think that's what he hasn't said it very well.
If that's what he was trying to explain.
Like if that's what he meant, he could have more eloquently said it as, um, guys,
like just, just try your best to avoid inferring the intent of the person you're
arguing against, try and keep it focused on what they've said, their points.
And it's like, yeah, that's, that's fine.
That's, that's, uh, that's, I agree with that.
But I think he's going further.
I think he's trying to say, don't try and assume the intent behind
people's opinions to dismiss that opinion.
I think that's what it's saying specifically.
But yeah, like, um, cause assuming someone's reasons for their opinion isn't
a bad thing, it can be very informative to try and understand the
presence of viewpoint and therefore you to try and counteract or
argue it if they're wrong.
And so, yeah, if, yeah, if you're correct about, if you are, if you are correct
about their reasons for why they think something that they think that could be
very, very helpful in changing their mind or getting it.
And also if they get it wrong, just say, no, that's not the reason.
Try again, you know?
Like if you say, well, you dislike Wind Waker cause you don't like colors.
It's like, well, that no, that's wrong.
Try again.
It's like, okay, we're fine.
Like we haven't, the conversation isn't irreparably destroyed of anything.
We've just crossed something off that we know that that's not the reason.
If they see that as the personal attack, then you're going to, I guess,
but then, um, you can, you don't have to, like, when you think you've assumed
someone's intention, you don't have to announce it just if you've got it, you
better understand, you probably understand, better understand that their
viewpoint if you're right.
So you can use that to, uh, your disadvantage, your disadvantage.
You're tired.
You're, you can use that to your advantage while you deconstruct like their actual,
uh, point, cause if you, if you think, you know, the reason they're making that
point, you can attack the call.
If I thought Jay really did hate black people and he was like, I just really
don't like black Panther and I say why.
And every reason he comes up with, I knock out as being like inaccurate.
And then I could at some point be like.
Well, see, you can't say it because then the, the cat's out of the bag per se, but
if Jay kept like alluding to it in each of his points, like, uh, maybe, yeah,
we'll just, and then I'm just like, do you, um, and then I could be like, do you
like, and then just name a bunch of, I'll be like, do you like blade?
Then you go, no, I hate blade.
Oh, why?
Like main characters, yeah, you're like, you're trying to fish around to finally
get that piece of information.
Cause if you lead the witness on this one, you'll lose, but, but it, you
know, it's valid to say that that would be unfair.
Like if I opened the conversation with being like, you just hate it because
black people would be like, wow.
Thanks.
A great thing to do as well is it's not, not what aboutism.
Don't just like, Oh, what about this thing?
Um, ask someone to explain to you why they don't have an issue with something
that you think demonstrates the same issue.
If, if they don't, you know, that's why it's not what's aboutism.
Isn't a good like defense for something when you're making just like a
response to someone cause it's like they could have so many things to say about
it, but if you ask them, it's like someone's like, Oh, I don't like, um, you
know, fucking despicable me three because of all the plot holes.
And then you go, um, okay.
So why do you, do you not feel that same way about the last Jedi?
I hear you like the Jedi.
Um, and see what their inconsistency is.
And you can, you can
we've been discovering lately, a lot of critics don't necessarily care for
whether or not something's consistent in plot or even character.
It's much more important to have a consistent message that they either
agree with or find to be very important to them.
Oh yeah.
And that's actually like that explains a lot of what they do.
And I'm not saying it's like invalid.
It's just like, thank goodness we have the explanation now.
But even then, like the messages in some of the films that they like us a fuck.
Oh, absolutely.
And I'd love to talk to Jenny about the message in a TLJ and have her answers
as just a selection of questions.
But that will be attacking her.
So I wouldn't want to do that.
You know, you don't want to argue with 12 hours.
We'll see.
No, that was just a hate stream.
What I'm suggesting would be an attack stream.
It's two different things.
Oh, I didn't write it was 11 hours.
I didn't write it was 11 hours, not 12.
It was 11 48 and we round up.
Yeah, but but it it's 11.
Oh, that's what I've been told.
Everyone has been saying you're right about that.
It is weird.
The B was that it was 11 hours.
No one wanted to say 12.
It's like they could have.
They could have said 12.
They could have.
They did it.
What was it?
Jay, was it you that said they didn't read that far?
They just read the 11 that went away.
Yeah.
Yeah, that seems like the kind of thing they would do.
Back on topic.
And sorry, if you do that, even if you think another person's
opinion is closed minded or whatever, you have made yourself
the close 44.
I'll drag us back to 40 again, you 40 is where I'm hoping this
pulls everyone back.
If you start that chain going and sorry, if you do that, even
if you think another person's opinion is closed minded or
whatever, you have made yourself the closed minded one, even if
you're like 99% sure that other person's opinion was made for
what you feel is a bad reason.
It is still not your place to call yourself a mind reader and
assume that you're right and to call them out for it, especially
when you're talking about literally every single person
that shares that opinion.
If I might indulge in a little.
Okay.
I would kind of agree with him with the people saying, you
know, you dislike whatever because you hate women.
So if it's like playing, yeah, if it's applying it in that
context, yeah.
Oh, in terms of not for sure.
Like I avoid students, they miss anyway.
Yeah, because he's saying it's not their place.
I wouldn't say necessarily it's not their place.
It's just, it's bloody stupid to try and say you hate the last
Jedi because you hate women.
It's like, whoa.
All right.
That's really extreme.
Um, so yeah, if it's saying that I think that could apply
somewhat.
No.
Yeah.
I don't disagree with that, but the way he got here was not like
what he was referencing didn't seem to be that.
Um, but I agree.
It applies to sweeping.
You think this is the thing you need specifics to be able to
make certain specific claims like that.
And if you're going to say the sweeping, you couldn't possibly
have all of that information about literally every single
person that shares that opinion.
If I might indulge in a little preachiness here, like I haven't
been already sick, you're not the thought police and you most
certainly cannot pretend that you're certain that every single
one of those people is wrong.
And their opinion is unfair and dumb.
The only thing that's unfair here is using such silly generalizations.
There are a lot of different reasons for a person to have any
given opinion.
So it's kind of ridiculous to try to invalidate that person.
All right.
Thing here is jumps between, um, a person and then everyone
who holds the opinion.
I think if you have evidence, you can infer the reasons for a
person to hold an opinion.
But then, uh, so I think is wrong if you apply that on the, uh, the
mic, the small scale, the individual.
Uh, but then I kind of agree with him.
If you were then apply it to the macro, the line where, yeah, you
couldn't assume, um, uh, you know, everyone who has that opinion
because that, yeah.
So
mean tweets where they say everybody who hates TLJ is a misogynist.
You'll be like, okay.
But I, I'm a little bit confused because the, initially it started
off with two people having a discussion.
Now it's been extrapolated to making comments about any person who
shares that view, which is not the same as what you were talking
about before.
And then he goes back in, he goes out to the, to the, you can't apply
this criticism to everybody.
And then he goes back in and says, cause this one person probably
has a reason compared to the rest that you're labeling with one thing.
And it's like, right, right.
You're nearly onto something there that it could have been valid depending
on if the person actually felt that way and that there's evidence for that.
Or they've admitted to it.
There's lots of things to consider, but it's just like, Ooh, wobbly.
Yeah.
Anybody else want to say anything?
Or no.
No, let's just continue.
Are a lot of different reasons for a person to have any given opinion.
So it's kind of ridiculous to try to invalidate that person by saying
their opinion is wrong instead of just saying that you haven't.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Wait, you've gone wrong there because you, you said it's bad.
So it's been validated.
No, but he's, he's changed it again.
Cause now he's saying, you know, you shouldn't be trying to invalidate it
and say the opinion is wrong.
It's like, no, no, no, no.
Now we're talking about like different things.
Again, the opinion might be wrong, but that that's different from what you
were just talking about before about inferring intent to just prove it.
That that's not the same.
Yeah.
They could have an, they could have a bias or an intent and still be right.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
Like let's not conflate the two.
That's the one we're talking about here.
Agreed.
Also, could someone who uses like invalidate them, they're like, what do
you mean when you say that?
Well, yeah, because it's always such a weird nebulous thing, like invalidate.
What do you mean?
And if we, invalidating my identity, it's like, what do you mean by that?
If we interpret it to mean I hold the opinion that X is bad and for three
reasons and you prove all three reasons wrong, my opinion is no longer standing
in a place that could be considered accurate.
And if that means invalid, fine.
Yeah, in that sense, sure.
But people do, you know, use disingenuous means to try and invalidate
arguments in a very intellectually dishonest way.
For instance, you're wrong because you're a Nazi, like, which has like, they'd
obviously, like, that's an ad hominem.
Exactly.
But they're using it to try and dismiss argument.
Oftentimes, obviously, very far from being Nazis, sometimes a complete
opposite, and, but by trying to vilify them and say that they should be
disregarded because they're a bad person when they're not really a bad person.
That's kind of what they're attempting to do, though, to, and so it is done
where people try and invalidate an opinion through very disingenuous means.
Yeah.
Try to invalidate that person by saying their opinion is wrong instead of just
saying that you have an opinion that is different.
If I, plus, if my opinion is wrong, I actually could demonstrate my opinion
was wrong, he's like, you're helping me out by telling me it's wrong.
Yeah.
And showing and saying an opinion is wrong.
I mean, if you have evidence for it, go power to you, you know, the
idea of being like, um, if you can prove, like if I say it's my opinion
that, uh, I don't know, Henry Cavill wasn't very good in the godfather.
It's like, okay, that's like just categorically false.
Yeah.
My, so the opinion is wrong, I guess.
Yeah.
Like, yeah.
Yes.
Then it's wrong.
Yeah.
Like, well, is that you, I wouldn't hear this.
It's just the way to mean feeling or judgment, which one are you going with?
It's almost like its own category of just like nonsensical.
Like the question doesn't even make sense.
No, like the opinion doesn't even make sense.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh, well, I think the issue is that it's, again, there's thinking about it as just
opinions are, oh, well, these are just things that we think about something, but
not taking it to its fullest extent to test the boundaries of what you mean by
an opinion, because the thing is, I don't know.
Sometimes opinions don't match with reality.
Well, the thing is, I feel like if I said that, he'd just be like, oh, but that's
just factually wrong, so it's not an opinion.
It's like, oh, well, what do you mean by that?
Like, it is an opinion.
I said it.
It's a judgment that I made.
Yeah.
If you think it is, your opinion's wrong.
It's yeah, you need to think about the definitions.
And then we delve into like, they might even do the pivot to like, oh, so my
feelings are now wrong.
I have them.
You can't say that.
And you're like, but what you're describing, how can you call that a feeling
versus this is what I'm, this is why we always go to act as being present in
films.
How do you feel that Henry Cavill is in fucking Godfather?
Like, how is that possible?
Like you've attached your opinion to something that doesn't really exist.
I'm, I'm curious why you, you're, you're, you're under some sort of misconception.
Yeah.
Now, Henry Cavill was merely an astral projection that only I could
most definitely, I can astral astral project his mustache away.
Union is wrong.
Instead of just saying that you have an opinion that is different.
I'm really not trying to call.
And no, no, I just want to be frank.
Some, some opinions are shit.
All right.
If someone's watching this show, then I know why they would have
concluded that long ago.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Union is wrong.
Instead of just saying that you have an opinion that is different.
I'm really not trying to call anybody out here.
And I know lots of people just kind of say stuff.
Oh yeah.
Don't call anyone out.
That would be an argument.
All right.
We can't have any of those.
That'd be bad.
I was going to say his logic doesn't allow him to do a lot of, um, well, any
kind of response for the most part, unless he,
but he is taking the calling out everyone who does the thing that he perceives to
be wrong.
Right.
It's very ironic.
Isn't it being the very premise of what is trying to establish here?
People are wrong in the way that they're arguing because they state other people
are wrong when they disagree with them.
And I state this by stating you're wrong.
And there's the, the, the implication for a lot of stuff is if you are arguing for
the affirmative of one position, then you are also saying that a lot of cases, if
you hold the differing position, you are wrong.
Yeah.
I'm putting too much weight.
He's outwardly called.
I mean, I think all of us would actually qualify in his, his video so far as
closed-minded from his perspective perspective, which is fucking hilarious.
Considering what the whole point of a FAP is not to mention that he's trying to
discourage people from doing that action and then saying, if they do it, they're
closed-minded and this action happens to be challenging someone's opinions, which
seems to be an attribute of someone who is the opposite of closed-minded, or at
least they're half there as long as they take in information themselves, you know?
Yep.
I'm really not trying to call anybody out here and I know lots of people just kind
of say stuff without putting too much weight on it, but I got to be honest with
you.
Oh, I know.
Maybe, maybe take a bit more care sometimes.
What?
I'm really tired.
So I want to drop out here.
All right.
No problem, Mr. J.
I'll speak to you at some later time.
Toodle, toodle.
Yeah.
All right.
But yeah, just the idea that like, you know, some people just say stuff and it's
like, yeah.
So one, try and be mindful of whatever you may say in whatever context you may
say it, and two, don't marry yourself to certain statements just because you said
them.
You might be like, you know what, I said that when I, without really thinking, yeah,
I don't really know what I'm talking about.
It's okay to do that.
Consider all of your, all of your positions as tentative.
Hey guys, I just need to go to the toilet quickly.
I'll be back.
All right.
All right.
What are we possibly going to discuss guys?
While we wait?
Oh, oh, I don't know.
Oh, I don't know.
What's it got brought up before the impeachment impeachment?
We know we can't be a, we can't be a political podcast.
A political.
A poli-tical poli-tical poli-tical Oh, I don't care if you talk about it.
I don't know if he was going to say something, but then he stops.
No, it's not relevant.
They're trying to kick Trump like we kick Jay.
I don't think they're going to have as much success as we do.
I don't think that they will.
We've literally kicked J and I have like a million times.
Like, can they even do it to Trump once?
We shall see.
Oh, no.
So Rags, who will you be voting for out of the Democrats?
I don't know.
I mean, who's going to be voting for?
Who's going to be voting for?
No, I mean, who's my favorite of all of them?
Is it Jeb Bush?
No, I wouldn't vote.
I wouldn't really.
Yeah.
Jeb Bush.
How about for Jeb?
Jeb's just what we need to turn this country around.
Jeb.
Make Jeb great again.
With an exclamation point.
M-J-A-M-U-G-G-A-G-A-G-A.
See, Jeb should have been Vice Vice President.
Come on, Trump.
I mean, it's pronounced M-U-M-J-G-A-M-U.
She didn't say clap.
And he just said, please, at the end of his speech, please, please.
He's at the voting booths and he's like, please vote for me.
But they're like, well, why should I vote for you?
And he's just like, please, please.
Just just just once, just just one little vote.
It's pretty crazy that he eventually, you know,
just started frowning at people with bad joker takes that was like that's where he ended up
for real wise of all the places he could have gone you know who would have seen it who would
have seen it who could have foreseen this conclusion and no chat i'm i'm not a democrat
we got some nice jab 2020s in chat good stuff i laugh at them talk about politics what did i miss
no no no we were just talking about talking about politics
oh yeah trying to call anybody out here and i know lots of people just kind of say stuff
without putting too much weight on it but i gotta be honest with you i firmly believe it is a mark
of immaturity to attack and try to invalidate a person's opinion instead of just saying why you
disagree and admitting that different people just play and have different opinions is a very immature
attitude i mean fucking hell it's an attitude that it's like a social contract we already
established when we got into just speaking it's like every whole different opinions yeah yeah
that's why i'm here like i want to challenge yours you're like no but you accept that i have
a different one it's like well yeah but i think the basis in which you've constructed it is flawed
that i would like to challenge it or at least question you can i do this in a way that doesn't
offend you can i just place pamphlets next to you that provide you information you may not have
or am i still attacking like interesting to go as far as things immature yeah but did he say that
you're allowed to discuss things just oh yeah that's the problem you can discuss it as long as
you never actually try to persuade somebody like for real which is odd well i know exactly what it's
fucking referencing it's like for me being like oh i love oh hate lord the rings because of the
overuse of um fucking practical effects i just hate practical effects and i go well i love it
because i actually really enjoy practical effects it really it really grounds the film to me makes
feel more real end of conversation so lame yeah then you're just both standing there awkwardly
like okay all right and you know some people might be like well do you guys never accept
that happening i'll be like well if you reach an impasse you can but i would be like why don't you
like practical effects and what do you mean like there's too many like how do you quantify that
and do you you feel like no the Socratic method is an attack on other people okay just give up
immediately like oh fuck okay well yeah shame we can't discuss anything and besides this is almost
like the same thing just using different means like what if you explain it in a in a way that
makes them really question why they think what they think and everything you know you're doing
the same thing you're just doing it in a superficially less aggressive way is really the
strongest you could phrase it all you gotta do is say it don't be a pussy write down on a pamphlet
and push it over and just put it in like a little kiosk and be like oh look at that pamphlet i'm
gonna go now you enjoy that pamphlet bye i'm gonna go over here then they look at the pamphlet and
they're like oh my goodness you know i think about this pamphlet you go oh my god what do
you think about that pamphlet it's gonna have to do with me i'm just i'm listening
um that's the non-attacky way okay guys and you need to start doing it otherwise you'll be
immature as immaturity to attack and try to invalidate a person's opinion instead of just
saying why you disagree and admitting that different people just play and have different
opinions is a very immature attitude and i really hope no one thinks i'm trying to stir anything up
here but it can also kind of make a person look insecure to simply state your opinion is to be
confident in your opinion to be i don't know man i think it's a lot more insecure to when
somebody is criticizing you of you to be like oh no you've ruined the discussion i'm out i'm
gone like how is that like saying this like two this is like two people coming up to each other
and one says you know what i'm the best wrestler around and the other guy says you know what i i
think i'm the best wrestler around and you're like okay you want to you want to you want to have a you
want to wrestle you want to find out who's the best wrestler in town yeah i want to find out who's
the best wrestler in town he's like what part of that isn't you know the confidence each one is
insanely confident to the point that they're willing to go after the other and prove funnily
enough he's engaging in what he just criticized he's just assumed the uh the the personal like
sort of perspective because we can have multiple motivations to challenge an opinion right if i
love yes but yeah yeah i was gonna say he's he's not wrong in that there's a potential for if if
ringy rips into something i really love and i immediately go well no it's good and i'm just
personally attached and i can't even consider hearing criticism for it i'm insecure that's
fine that's one another reason could be oh that's really interesting for me like um well so this is
what i think about it and then fringy's like no you can't criticize my opinions like who's the
insecure one now um there's so many different reasons this can happen he's just assumed that
you be it would be evidence of your insecurity if you were to challenge an opinion it's like
you're actually assumed a lot of things he's a toxifying my conversation he's
toxified it stop him arrest him it's an argument now well he's assumed close-mindedness immaturity
and um insecurity yeah so this is wow i didn't we didn't catch this the first time we watched this
video because we were pausing every frame which tells you a lot about a script when you do it
foreign opinions is a very immature attitude and i really hope no one thinks i'm trying to
stir anything up here but it can also are you just called people immature to simply state your
i'll just replay just play and have different opinions is a very immature attitude and i
really hope no one thinks i'm trying to stir anything up here but it can also kind of make
a person look insecure to simply state your opinion is to be confident in your opinion
to be so uncomfortable with opposing opinions that you have to come up with reasons why they're
actually wrong not really why does he frame it like you're inventing so that's you're so
uncomfortable with other ideas you are engaging with them instead you know gala layers they're
like earth is circle it's like wow how insecure are you man every we just think it's flat god
and you've got to come up here and prove that it's not wow jeez insecure much immature much
god gala layer grow up this is so backwards how do you say this and not be like oh wait no that's
done what i said that doesn't make any sense at all i said the opposite of what's true
and uh the whole uh it takes like you know security to be able to just declare your opinions
like no you could just be an idiot you could be obnoxious a lot of people can just say stuff
it doesn't have to be indicative of their personality being one of confidence and security
you could just be like wow that thing's shit and then you go is it and then they go uh
i don't know i just you know fuck it no i i don't know i just thought something just leave me alone
okay if anything in many instances when i hear something that is just so incorrect i'm kind of
like affronted because i admire truth i want truth and stuff and so my desire to generally
correct people and stuff isn't out of insecurity or anything like that it's uh because i appreciate
facts and stuff i mean he is assuming that um yeah that the whole insecure thing is you're
absolutely right more he is assuming people to be insecure who challenge other people's opinions
whoops it's like it's totally backwards yeah yeah he'd fold on this in a second if he was confident
i think yeah i don't think anybody would actually maintain all the things that he said because
there's a lot of stuff in here that would just cancel himself out see i wouldn't say he's
universally wrong i do know of people who get very easily aggressive when they're challenged
in their opinions and sometimes i feel it's a result of them being insecure in those views
but i couldn't apply that universally to everyone who gets upset when their opinions are challenged
yeah i i would say that the majority of i would say that the more majority of truly insecure
people would definitely stray far away from really going on the affirmative and engaging
in these discussions and going out and looking to disprove other people yep usually confident
people go in the offensive oh yeah you mean they attack people right what do you mean
no all right let's continue then in your opinion to be so uncomfortable with opposing opinions
that you have to come up with reasons why they're actually wrong not really the mark of a confident
person say you build your house in the hills and your neighbor builds their house in the trees
a confident person simply says i prefer living in the hills wait what the fuck is this analogy
here's a better here's a better analogy so let's go to the good old house on sand and house on rocks
so you built your house on rocks your neighbor's built on sand and you're like dude are you sure
that that's like i'm worried that that's going to fall down man look how insecure you are bringing
look how insecure you are oh fuck just be secure in the fact your house is on rocks don't worry
about my sand house and i say i say this knowing the irony by the way i was going to say to steel
man him even though i'm not really doing this i have an issue with this argument it'll be like
you know you both got a hot dog you choose a different topping or sauce like someone goes
oh what's wrong with that you're like i don't give a shit what you think i like the taste of
this stuff it's like yeah you can be you know choosing the house debate it's like but there
are actually there's a lot that goes into choosing a house dude yeah the hot dog's way more subjective
than the you know house foundations why did you choose a house i like the idea of you got two guys
one of them's like hey what toppings you want on hot dog oh just get some mustard the other one's
like i want some cyanide and then you're like are you worried that you're gonna like die from
eating that it's like man jeez how insecure are you about your mustard all this foam just starts
coming out it's like i don't know about you man this is great let's just start choking on their
own yeah let's let's hear the whole analogy then i don't know why he's gone with this one i feel
like there's so many easy words really the mark of a confident person say you build your house in
the hills and your neighbor builds their house in the trees a confident person simply says i prefer
living in the hills a confident person does not then go to their neighbor's house in the trees
and try to tear it down i said no no no this no a confident yeah a confident person says the tree
is the best place to build a house and here's why yeah a confident person says the hills are the
best place to build a house and here's why i love that he's did like to to combat an opinion
that you think is invalid is the same as tearing down somebody's house what the fuck take that
analogy and apply it to people it would be someone has an opposing opinion and i go and try and kill
them yeah it's pretty much yeah like that that that's the uh you know equivalent to people in
terms of tearing it down like he's like associating his opinion as like his temple or something and
we're destroying it like criticizing it like don't be so attached i like the idea of somebody
building a house out of sand and like you know it gets really windy and it starts blowing everywhere
and you're like mate what's the deal like why are you so obsessed with sand minecraft
and then he screams it as the house just evaporates around him
what what in the world are you thinking with that one a confident person does not then go to their
neighbor's house in the trees and try to tear it down i say all this because what are the debates
surrounding the links awakening really weird i know seeing on twitter especially a confident
person might go to the person the tree and say you know there's a lot of inherent dangers for
building in a tree you might want to build on a mountain instead just trying to help you out
just and then they throw the tree fruits at you and say get the hell out of here you insecure
piece of shit you attacking me i equate that for the equivalent of you trying to tear down my tree
you physically assaulted my tree very bad analogy uh what what a strange one yeah yeah i can't get
over how adorable this game looks i know i know right which is we're getting to that now i think
which i remember me and fringy took most issue with that bit or at least a lot of it so oh gosh
here we go if if we're getting to that point like you said um is this whole preamble here
is it just to to solve to set the scene of oh don't don't attack what i think because you're
insecure and immature if you do i if he had made his video entirely on the idea of it's weird how
when someone's positive and someone criticizes that positive take a lot of people are like hey
leave him alone there's just a take however if someone's negative and someone criticizes the
negative take not many people step into defense uh unless it almost seems hypocritical if that was
his only point and then he moves into saying i've experienced this a lot because i don't like the
way the new game looks it's not it doesn't work for me i find it distracting i find it weird i
guess i associate a lot with how delta used to local does typically look and this this is just
pulling me right out and a lot of people are ripping into me for that i'd be like this video
is fine yeah this is totally fine that'd be an interesting one actually yeah that would be an
interesting discussion to have because like really tell me about that i'm that's unusual
yeah but he's kind of ruined it actually by doing this
i didn't tear it down i say all this because of a lot of the debate surrounding the links awakening
remake that i've been seeing on twitter especially i've seen plenty of people respectfully
stating their opinions that they don't like the art style but you know what's been at the forefront
the tweets they get all the likes and the retweets and are all over my timeline ones that are like
the people who don't like links awakenings art style are blah blah blah anyone who doesn't like
how this looks was probably blah blah blah yeah no they're jerks yeah well i mean even if they
weren't uh if we're gonna treat them entirely seriously i wouldn't recommend yeah don't take
these seriously they're bullshit yeah they're obviously yeah they can't know what every single
person is unanimously thinking that's ridiculous of course sounds like typical twitter hyperbole
yeah and obviously he's created like caricatures of them but still i mean they do exist anyone
who thinks uh rais and mary sue is uh you know doesn't like yeah yeah yeah you got those ones
not naming names here and i adore most of the people that made those tweets that's that's why
i follow them in the first place not trying to call them out just i hope he applies that same
if he watched this i hope he applies that same sort of uh generosity can we get super meta here
and actually repurpose his initial arguments against him now as in the very structure of
telling someone that the way they're criticizing somebody isn't the right way to do it because
they're like directly contradict contradicting what they feel or think is the right thing
at the time aren't you doing this to them about that subject isn't that technically what's
happening and you might be like well this is different because we're talking about the actual
structure of it and i just be like oh well that's interesting how that works if you follow that
structure then uh that's saying that you're wrong yeah like you shouldn't he shouldn't be doing this
right because he's technically well we've already accused him of doing that already because he has
the uh the insecure immature what was the third one uh close-minded yeah like he's already gone
further than he needs he's crossed that line well long ago so the people that made those tweets
that's that's why i follow them in the first also for the record it's his line like i'm
fine with people crossing that line uh what i typically say is like if you're gonna throw
an insult criticism that's a little bit more personal just be right as long as you're like
on point um it doesn't bother me as much but like when you're so overconfident that you rip
into someone personally and you were wrong the whole time it's like oh gosh that's embarrassing
but um yeah like i try not to take insults like that into account at all and um because a lot
of time they can be jokes a lot of time they can fluff up the thing but ultimately they're not even
really important um yeah one could just be frustrated it happens place not trying to call
them out just saying i take slight issue with that way of putting forth an opinion or rather
invalidating a different opinion a lot of people are saying this is the wind waker situation all
over again and i can agree slightly but i do think there are a lot of differences
when nintendo first revealed wind waker i was one of the many people who were put off by the
cartoony new art style as more trailers came out i got over my apprehensions though and of course
went on sorry another interesting total clip of him was he supposed to catch that thingy
and he just kept rolling around it oh right like yeah yeah weird choice yeah generally
the gameplay that i put in my videos is like not me fucking up over and over
it's me totally superficial but it's just it's a part of the process nonetheless
yeah stylistic choice to have that particular clip first yeah came out i got over my apprehensions
though and of course went on to love the absolute spaghetti sauce out of the game as many others
did as well especially as it's aged people have come to really appreciate the simple yet fun
colorful and uniquely beautiful visuals and when you think about it as an evolution of the
previously realistic i mean you're playing the wrong footage though that's uh the 3d 3ds remake
which looks better the original one kind of doesn't look very good anymore very blocky yeah
as an evolution of the previously realistic 3d zeldas it's kind of jarring but as an evolution
of the original zeldas it makes perfect sense if wind waker were the very first 3d zelda i think
the initial reception would have been much more positive context is very important with these
things it's technically no wait wait wait so context is appropriate for why people like feel
that way but not the arguments themselves like the context like not necessarily right
like when it came out is what i think he's trying to say you know wind waker came out at this time
which is why i'm not this way but i'm not a huge fan of this appeal anyway so he's like
it came at a time where it would be less abrasive in terms of a change of style and i'm just like
so you're not really talking about the style itself just whether or not people would be ready for it
which is yes or whether or not because it was the first of its kind and it was a new thing
people are more willing to accept that being part of its difference and yeah like whether or not
people were ready to like it or not ready to like it i'm just like okay but that's not
that interesting to me i'm sure yeah it's it's it's like a lot of other like if a franchise has
a spin-off people are more willing to forgive it for being different because it's a a spin-off
it's it's a new thing that it's trying you know that some people dislike link's awakenings art
style now but will end up coming around and absolutely loving it in that way it is a little
similar to the wind waker thing you've got an upcoming zelda game with a pretty distinct and
very colorful almost cutesy visual style and some people don't like it but i do feel like the two
situations differ by quite a lot and the big reason is again context when wind waker was revealed 3d
console gaming was still relatively young most of us had spent years playing games with 2d sprites
and those older games were most often cartoony because cartoony characters just looked better
when rendered in pixels on small screens it was a better choice for the i mean i'm not sure that
that's even really true why i don't like where this is going though kitty again he's like we were
more ready for cartoons i was like what are you doing man and also it's the fact of how good can
you make zelda look when you only have an objectively smaller amount of pixels um but
trying to go for realism then most most video games back then were cartoony i mean i i guess
like maybe but i don't know if i'd say yeah mortal combat was like made from pixelated
actual photographs metroid streets of rage there's a whole bunch of games that tried to sort of push
for a little bit more realistic i mean it's not and also the whole thing of like oh most of us
played 2d games at the time it's like i don't know i would have i was uh you know i was like seven
or eight when uh wind waker came out so i mostly was playing 3d games by then so so what does that
mean does that mean like oh i was more ready for it that's i don't know like that's such a weird
thing that's a weird i know the art style of wind waker totally turned me off i got into like zelda
ocarina of time and stuff um yeah the cartoon character i was like that looks crap and i
didn't even you know have an interest in it that was just my reaction and yeah that was an example
of art affecting my uh judgment of it just to clear it up with um fio is objectively smaller
number of pixels objectively inferior if the goal is to create a realistic image
i would say yes it is yeah i mean less detail means less detail yeah not necessarily though
because you could have like a shit ton more pixels and less detail depending on what developer does
with them you know the developer does them like you could have yeah so i mean there could be
variables but you could analyze each individual against um yeah all right tech that was available
when 3d gaming became a thing and games like zelda were able to be more realistic we saw that as a
natural progression of the media uh but that but there are a lot of games that weren't realistic
at the time crash bandicoot super mario 64 banjo yeah yeah you're right and and you could you could
i was gonna say couldn't someone make the argument like oh i didn't like the first realistic one
because zelda's always been cartoony yeah well of course you could well i think that he would
agree that someone could what i'm saying is like this is almost nonsense data like i don't care
why do we anyone kid so anyone can make any reason they want for not liking whether or
not it's a cartoon at whatever time that's like yeah yeah i'm looking for something more
because we're finally able to depict their characters in the ways they envisioned rather
than with simplistic little pixely blobs mario ate mushrooms and jumped on turtles so it made
sense that his first 3d game was cartoony and that he remained cartoony after that but when
ocarina of time came out it was like yeah this makes sense this is right for zelda what do you
mean by that this is more right more right i mean it's a kids game still i mean a kids game it's
more like in every one game but you know they expect kids to play zelda you could easily have
gone down the toon route with with zelda's original incarnation i mean a lot of their games
are sort of cartoony and so shaded like in fact i think the majority of zelda games are cartoony
and so shaded i'll take eventually i'm handheld i mean oh yes i'd call ocarina of time cartoony
still because yeah it's still it's still not realistic it's still got exaggerated proportions
it's more like a warcrafty i mean it doesn't look like warcraft but it's more like a warcraft sort
of um interpretation right where it's like things are sort of more stylized and you know
a little bit unrealistic and there's nothing wrong with that like it's fine and if we're talking
about his criteria here then is super mario galaxy's mario more cartoony than uh super mario
world on the game boy cartoony like how do you how how are you more how is one of those more
cartoony than the other what is what standard are you using this is a very loose criteria right
more or less cartoons yeah super loose i don't think you could ever fully properly define what
you mean by this so what are you actually trying to say here is he trying to say that um criticizing
the different art styles is uh no point and it's invalid because what what he's uh what he's trying
to do is he's trying to draw a distinct because the the issue is if this game is like wind waker
then he's wrong because wind waker kind of proves people wrong that the art style was really good he
needs to separate them out yeah so what he's doing is um he's trying to say well you got to consider
the context right wind waker came out people weren't used to cartoony 3d games because we
had ocarina which made more sense and so when wind waker came out people were apprehensive
and then he's going to make a different argument yeah like he's going to say people were wrong
about wind waker for this reason they're right about this new game for this reason that's pretty
part of it is like one of the arguments i know that he makes is there are a lot of cartoony
games now like overwatch and um and you know stuff like that so it's not that innovative
it's like okay like that's that's irrelevant like that's not in i think a lot of this is
content related because he framed the mario games as he eats mushrooms on goombas so that's like
sillier than what the legend is zelda has so mario's far more justified in continuing to be
more and more cartoony because of it which is a very narrow-minded view of cartoons man absolutely
the concerts are just silly and kid friendly let's talk about what happens in rick and morty
in terms of like thematic lessons or um the gore or the nudity and then without mentioning
anything about this art style or what kind of tv show it is and i go guess and then he says well
it's a probably a realistic tv show maybe i'm like no it's a cartoon rip yep um yeah
throw it back after that but when ocarina of time came out it was like yeah this makes sense
this is right for zelda it's a more mature series you're killing monsters with a sword you're
solving puzzles there's a little more to it then majora's mind you're as opposed to mario where
you're killing turtles by bludgeoning them to death with your boot crush them stomping them
beneath your feet also he said there's a little more to it i feel like there's a war that's
supposed to erupt between mario and zelda fans well i mean that's a funny statement a little more
to it what do you mean by that yeah this definitely was like wait explain that
and is that how games work the more it has to it the more realistic it should be
yeah that's another weird assumption too yep there's a little more to it then majora's mask
with its even darker tone seemed to solidify the idea that as graphical capabilities improved
zelda would naturally become more realistic and by extension awesome looking that was why
the wind waker reveal was so jarring at the time it was hard to see it as a group of artists simply
making art the way they wanted to make it all the zelda guys had all sorts of reasons for going with
that style but to a lot of us it felt like a step backward we didn't understand why they would want
to make zelda look like a cartoon we couldn't see how uh so can you not apply this argument to
link's awakening they have a lot of reasons but you just can't understand it you can't anything
like this can go into a lot of different places and again like all he's doing is answering why
these people may have felt this way and i'm just like all right fine fine doesn't really get on
with it i get it fine it's possible that people felt this way because of these things okay they
didn't really think it through that much uh is what i would probably criticize them for
yeah i mean i was i was a young kid so as most i i have no idea what i just felt away and that
was that and i never looked any further into it i was like oh wind waker this looks oh a thing
like i don't like you know i don't there's no way i'd be able to elaborate why at that
i wouldn't have been able to when i was that young yeah i would just like instant and first
impressions it's like oh i like how this cartoon is and the thing is i uh i probably would have
liked it when i was a kid i didn't play it when i was a kid but i probably would have liked it
i was about the right age well being the old man here uh because i was old enough when wind waker
was released and like i said i didn't like the cartoonish style and it comes down to
what you are what is perceived to be established as the kind of status quo of the series almost
like what is uh what it goes down to what do you define a series to be and probably the best
analogy i could reference here is the whole spider-man debates we've had you know what is
a good spider-man movie what are we what are the core characteristics that help define it to be
that right and so in my time the core characteristics of what i was kind of perceiving to
be zelda was you know uh are more kind of realistically depicted you know game in the
sense of what the graphics are capable of and so when i go to the wind waker thing i was just like
what that looks crap kind of thing and at what point do you deviate so far away from something
else that i mean it it's like it's a it's a matter of keeping up tradition is kind of a way of
describing one game going to the sequel going to sequel to the next thing certainly with um you
get with like final fantasy games with zelda games there are similarities between a lot of them
and if you go too far away from that to the point where you're just like what um like for those of
us who played final fantasy one and two and four and five and seven and all those games
what did final fantasy the spirits within like how did you like how do you how do you connect all
these you know final fantasy how is this uh like what you know and that'll throw people for a loop
but the thing is uh in the case of um wind waker it's still structurally very similar to the other
games yeah like from a gameplay perspective it's kind of you can tell that it's a zelda game
so it's just graphics enemies bombs it's just the graphics and and then you compare it to like
breath of the wild which has a lot more difference between that and a lot of the other zelda games
in terms of structure and all that and yet it's still a zelda game well yeah this is very loose
well that's what i mean it seems like the definition of what is a zelda game is a far
more kind of loose adaptive thing than what many people perceive as what is required to
make a good spiderman movie yeah i would i would agree with that i think um i think that uh zelda
is quite diverse as a series um it's actually very diverse and maybe this is retroactively
looking at it but i mean there have been so many different types of zelda games at this point
but like i i don't mind that this is true that someone makes the assumption that hey
this isn't what zelda is that's what this is and then they don't like it for that reason that's
fine um it's just he's spending so long on this and a lot of his reasoning is a little shaky
in terms of like yeah i don't you know like you're not going to be the one to say like if they're
a ball uh if you do more if they're a ball mechanics it should be more realistic graphics
you'd be like i don't think so um and also like even with spiderman i've said you can try and
adapt uh original content and stuff like that and if it results in a better version i'd be all
on board with it i'll be sweet right exactly if you want to try and change the graphics of a game
to be a very different style to even what i perceived as being very different and i didn't
like it originally if it resulted in a better product i would be oh that's sweet i'm all on
board with it um and so it's all about the end quality that helps determine it my mind at least
yeah that's funny to think though the more mechanically extensive it is the more realistic
it has to be he's like laughs in civilization for yeah how such a style could fit the series
even though we soon learned it most certainly could but the link's awakening remake is coming
at a very different time in gaming history we are absolutely used to colorful cartoony visuals in our
zelda games and in fact our games in general it's no longer a new concept well i guess sure yeah
i'm i'm i'm gonna just let that go so i'm really curious what his count is gonna be like where he's
going yeah sure in our zelda games and in fact our games in general it's no longer a new concept
that scares us every single quote unquote 2d zelda has been colorful and cartoony and everyone
seems to be fine with that no one was looking for gritty realistic graphics in link between worlds
despite the fact that we all knew the 3ds was capable of such a thing ocarina of time and
major's mask were on the system yet when i knew too sorry it had to buffer for me for a second
where are you guys at eight oh six yeah yeah i'm at eight oh four so we got about a two second gap
now so get back a bit everyone at seven fifty yeah to be fine with that no one was looking
for gritty realistic graphics in link between worlds despite the fact that we all knew the 3ds
was capable of such a thing ocarina of time and major's mask were on the system yet when
a new 2d zelda came along nobody seemed to mind that it looked the way it did and look at the
rest of the gaming landscape too the whole graphics race back in gens five and six where the best
games were the ones that looked the most realistic that's not as much of a thing anymore especially
if you're into indie games you're probably playing and i would disagree with his assertion that the
best games are the ones with the best graphics is like i think he was saying that that was the
climate yeah that was almost a claim an attitude and i mean that race is still going
yeah yeah definitely still going i mean look at look at how much people talk about what it was
graphics determine a game's quality if it has yeah like graphics isn't irrelevant oh yeah but
yeah it's not the whole thing that's what my point is yeah some people would
blame that and then there was a lot of talk about that that like a lot of people would be like
what's better the ps3 or the xbox 360 and one of the arguments would be there's better graphics
on the ps3 to be like i don't know that maybe we should think about a lot of things not just that
um but the graphics has always been um this thing that like will be used in marketing like to this
day oh look at look at the marketing for the ps4 before the xbox one x came out the most powerful
console and now the xbox one x it'll change everything fringy you'll see yeah it's i've
ever seen the ad for minecraft in 4k and i was like minecraft in 4k i mean okay that's hard and
i was like huh yeah because my point is yeah even back then if a game came out with the best
graphics ever if the gameplay was still crap i wouldn't yeah good game it would still be a crap
game yeah i don't think nintendo has been getting away with it forever with the most graphically
intensive consoles yeah yeah the nintendo navigator to be the most graphically
uh advanced of everything they're just like no we just we're having fun
or it's making good games a large list of good games that stand apart from the rest staggering
list what do you consider all the ip's on the nintendo oh yeah oh it's a massive massive is it
i see it's where the games with a lot of different styles many of which are cartoony and fun heck
some of the most popular shooters in the world right now are basically cartoons gritty realism
is less important now than it's been in ages we are more open to different artistic styles
than we have been in ages i mean this is more of a nitpick i was always open to it but maybe
maybe he's right maybe everybody is more open now than they were before but i'm just like okay
so to say that people dislike link's awakenings look because it's colorful or whatever is simply
wrong people aren't going what a simple colorful 2d zelda game unheard of no like i said there are
specific and in my opinion what do you know come on the reasons are that other games have
cartoony graphics that's a fucking stupid reason and also games flat out said someone else was
wrong yeah he did rip the first couple i was actually yeah we're gonna replay that rip is
preamble and uh he threw it in my opinion is it the first time in this video he's done that or is
uh i think he might have yeah first time it was funny i i mentioned my issues with the
in my opinion thing on uh did rotix uh channel last night or the night before and um like a
half hour later he was describing something that he said in my opinion i well yeah in my
and i was like it's fine you say it it's okay like what's your issues uh just the the most of
the time people are using it as a please leave me alone preamble and um i just it's it's mostly
unnecessary just leave it out you don't need it um most of the time the language should even this
is funny it's like me and joe's fans can line up on this but for different reasons he's like
everything you say is subjective and i'm like no your words will define whether or not what you
said was objective or subject you don't need in my opinion and in my opinion doesn't even work if i
say in my opinion ryan reynolds does not star in deadpool you're like i don't care that you put in
my opinion on there you're just wrong so you're like i feel like the it's it's almost a word that
we should just get rid of because no one's using it fucking right anymore and to use it right would
it wouldn't be needed um and i also advocate for just uh say what you mean instead with that word
so whatever you're using opinion as a cover for and in my opinion it typically would be used
as a judgment uh rather than feelings i don't typically but you know it could be and so that's
for me and it's just like whoever else is using it just uh i guess you could i'm trying to think
of like a sentence to explain this best but like you know i felt uh scared by paranormal activity
you wouldn't you don't need to convert that statement into in my opinion paranormal activity
is scary you should be like i found it scary if you yeah but if you said i have judged this
movie to be scary that carries this weight with it that kind of implies that you have judge you
found it a certain way because you've judged it you have looked at it you have found things that
have led you to conclusions that you could call upon judgment seems like the objective version of
the word oh yeah and then the other conclusion is that when you say that someone's judgment is faulty
um or it's a strong judgment uh people are much more i think ready to hear that than your your
opinion is faulty because they're like ah how could you how could you say that that's wrong you can't
have opinion is defined as something that can't be falsified you're like oh it is oh wait if it
can't be falsified then it's almost yeah worthless yeah can we replay the whole thing that you just
we can just sorry killer shooters in the world right now are basically cartoons gritty realism
is less important now than it's been in ages we are more open to different artistic styles than
we have been in ages so to say that people dislike link's awakenings look because it's
colorful or whatever is simply wrong people aren't so yeah that's not cool dude there's
gonna be one guy out there who's like no that is what i think he just did attack them like from
the beginning of this video saying saying someone's opinion is wrong is an attack and
then you should discuss it and you shouldn't just say you know that is wrong he's just broken his
own rules anyway when you did that so yes um and you could be like oh come he could be here right
now he's like oh come on no one actually does think that i'd be like are you sure there probably
is at least one person who's like i'm sick of cartoons yeah i think it's it's downright
reasonable i could be like it's way too colorful and vibrant like absolutely
i feel like throwing up looking at it and you're like okay all right sure yeah that's the thing
that would just be like yeah i i can understand how that can happen so i don't think you're lying
to me so yeah going what a simple colorful 2d zelda game unheard of no like i said there are
specific and in my opinion reasonable reasons to dislike it that extend far beyond the simple
not something different no no no because your arguments so far have been there are two there
are lots of games of the cartoony so that seems to be relevant for his hand in the cookie jar he
just said reasonable reasons meaning there's such a thing as unreasonable reasons oh oh got him
but mala how can we know that reason is a reason well um i'd like to discuss that with you he's
like you'd like to attack me no i can't stand this attack to dislike it that extend far beyond
the simple it's something different and people don't like things that are different which has
been somewhat true at some points in history sometimes drastic change can scare people but
it's also just a lazy argument and it completely dismisses all legitimate criticism as people just
being neophobic to always play the people just hate new things card is to suggest that new things
are literally immune to criticism and no one's allowed to dislike them which is just oh what's
different no no that's there's a difference between yeah there's a difference between people
not liking things because they're new in the criticism of each individual new thing yeah
because you've just missed you like took the point and re extrapolated into a different thing like
if someone has an actual thing they're like i hate change and then i'm like you don't like this
you hate change and then they go oh so everything that's new can't be criticized i'd be like where
did you get that from man how much did we get that with tlj you just don't like it's new it's
something new you just don't like it because it's new like no we don't like it because it's shit
well now that doesn't work because we like mandalorian to get fucked
i was going to say like yeah okay we don't like that add force awakens add solo add the
probably rise of skywalker uh i'd be like fuck we probably like mandalorian because as a male
character did you did you hear my last shot uh anita said that she she was shocked to see
there's no men in episode one i mean women's females with voice lines even though the yamara
was not even was since she's in charge of the mandalorian camp a woman in power it would it
would appear and uh you don't hear neophobic use too much not a not a word you hear often
um so you know there you go big word that did not tell it play the people just hate new things card
is to suggest that new things are literally immune to criticism and no one's allowed to
dislike them which is just ridiculous and moving forward just so you're not left guessing it looks
so good it looks so great and not saying that i hate the style though i will say i'm skeptical
that it was the best choice for the reasons i'm about to go over i think the game looks really
nice in its own way and i will very much enjoy it but i just feel like i might have enjoyed the
style a little more if they'd gone with something different so i'm kind of on the fence and i very
much oh that's such a like non-committal dull thing to say who's gonna disagree with that yeah
like i'm i'm skeptical that this was the best way that yeah sure it's possible there's a better one
the way i'm not sure if i'll yeah i'm not sure if there would be something better unless you say
no this is the best way and who's gonna say that yes that's like how does he possibly know what
does he mean the best way what does that mean well he's weighing it as he's judging to judge
this as the best compared to every possible alternative that could ever be made no reasonable
person is going to say that no which is why yeah so far we're not going to be able to challenge
them on that stuff this is like yeah okay okay you haven't said really anything yet but okay
so i'm kind of on the fence and i very much understand where the criticism is coming from
let's get right to it though i think you can probably boil all this disagreement down to
one aspect of the game's style it's not that it looks colorful or cartoony but that it looks like
it's made out of toys a lot of the objects have this plasticky sheen and there's a depth of field
effect that elicits the feel of macro photography octopath traveler is another recent game that
used this effect heavily to make the world look like a little paper diagram or something
now the depth of field thing i'm all right with a lot of people seem to be pretty annoyed by it
but i think it's a nice little effect my problem is with the whole plastic thing no i i this thing
again this is a very subjective opinion yes yes this is the peak of subjectivity it's just like
all right oh yeah i like the glossy waxy kind of look to everything i think it's nifty i think it
it makes everything seem vibrant and shiny like there it's very well lit it makes it look like
uh it gives it a sort of meta feel you know if it was like it's uh a kid's play set yeah it's like a
it actually makes it look like it's real in the sense that it's made from plastic and not a
computer you know cgi image um but i mean it is perfectly allowed to dislike that effect yeah
going to try and astound like put forward that his view is more correct than others he's gonna
he's gonna give his reasons for it is what's probably gonna happen i think i think he gives
his reasons all right other nintendo games have employed this effect and i've never been a huge
fan of it it looks attractive in a certain raw horsepower sort uh what it it looks attractive
in a raw horse so is he is he talking about um like we're talking like pixel polygon graphical
fidelity effects on screen kind of way are like like where you could say yeah there there's more
raw horsepower graphically in the order 1886 than there is in you know uh you know stardew valley
he's like sure yeah i i get what you're saying yeah okay does that make it better uh hmm
um sense for these issues metatextual in an unironically right uh i didn't say metatextual
did i say metatextual i thought you did i don't think so things okay so i just want to uh just
highlight i'm going to choose to say this is from an anonymous author uh but they they just
matched at the the discord i just find this funny so said about the uh the podcast obviously um
why am i not surprised efab is a disgusting cesspool their panel intellectual cowards without
consistent principles of freedom of speech i tire of their pretension they've become a meme
have we had inconsistent principles on freedom of speech possibly i'm not aware of them though
because we're pretty we're we're pretty uh as far as i know we're pretty much all in the uh
freedom of speech is uh double plus good triple plus you might even say no no no no no no no no
except with pineapple on pizza that's where i draw oh yeah we gotta draw the line somewhere
we're not barbarians how else can you have a civilization you gotta you gotta start making
rules but if they are taking sarcasm like that literally wow then i'm not gonna worry too much
about them i mean i the only thing you could say about that is i mean each individual person might
have you know how far is their extreme you know where how far how far do they go but i think for
the purposes of where it will pop up in conversation for the vast majority of times yeah we're all pretty
consistent on it that's just what a liar would say no yeah that's a troll you would hope so you
would hope so i mean maybe yes let's hope i've got a hope sure thing other nintendo games have
employed this effect and i've never been a huge fan of it it looks attractive in a certain
raw horsepower sort of way but it doesn't actually make a lot of sense for skin or cloth
or whatever to look like plastic unless it's actually supposed to be link's awakening looks
much more like it's okay what if it makes sense to look like this unless it's supposed to well i
think it's supposed to look like this so yeah it's interesting where he gets that base opinion that
it doesn't make sense for it to look that way when there's it's not too hard to think of many reasons
why it would make sense for them to make it look that way maybe they want to sell toys and they
want it to look as close to the toys as possible that's one i mean we already mentioned that it
makes it looks more realistic like it's actually made out of plastic he was the one who even said
that and that makes it pop a bit more as a result i think that's another reason it could just be a
matter of this is the artistic vision that they had in their head this is what they created and
they liked it and they try it you're like let's make link let's make this and they made all these
assets and they really like this aesthetic and so they kind of did everything else to kind of
match together in the same style and they got the finished product and they're like wow this is
really pretty much what i was going for i really think this looks great i certainly he's like how
skin and cloth wouldn't look like this and i'm like but they would if they were plastic right
and this is what this game is justified yeah and it's perfectly justified in not liking the look
but now it's gone a step further this day it doesn't make sense and then it crossed a line
into a different conversation now so now we get to actually respond instead of it like no yes
link's hair doesn't really look like hair it's like it didn't when it was three pixels on a
game boy either yeah we could this is what i mean this is not gonna lead into a good place this is
weird doesn't actually make a lot of sense for skin or cloth or whatever to look like plastic
i don't know i mean i'm looking at these uh these princess peaches here as like that doesn't
i don't know it's uh not like the real thing not gonna lie so
actually supposed to be link's awakening looks much more like it's going for the whole plastic
toy effect than most other games especially when combined with the depth of field thing
and i've got a number of problems with this one problem is that the whole made of real material
thing is approaching really overdone territory as far as i can see it's starting so the argument
is that it's being done too much it's been done in our four games i think i don't know that that's
oh that argument yeah i don't like it either i don't know either the quantity of something
doesn't determine if it's good or bad i mean like it might make him tired of seeing it but that's
an individual thing he can't then impose that perspective on everyone else that yeah because
it would explain there's perhaps why someone is liking it less it's like oh this is all over the
place we'll be like okay but that's not a flaw because the things that i can think of are like
string kirby paper mario that's um yeah there's a couple because there's a little we can we can do
this pretty easily a lot of people say you know it's like oh i'm so tired of marvel films there's
just so many marvel films they're often gonna actually conceives like they're not even that
bad i just there's just so man i'm just so tired of marvel films which is fine um and if that is the
argument that's fine but you can't go further than just being like advocating for a personal
preference there because some guy might be like i want a hundred more marvel films not enough
eat more and the box office certainly doesn't seem to know they're gonna keep going
there's a good comment in chat i like your being a try hard is not a good argument
it's like yeah i can't
eight of real material thing is approaching really overdone territory as far as i can see
it started with kirby's epic yarn but then within just the last few years kirby also went full on
clay paper mario perfected the realistic paper craft aesthetic yoshi had a whole game made of
yarn this seems awesome though we've got all these different yeah yeah i'm not like i don't
rather have him showing yarn cotton uh plastic clay all these ones i'm just like oh man this
is so cool we have all of these um and now he's basically getting the color splash treatment mixed
with a whole bunch of crafts made from real world stuff in my opinion the novelty is wearing thin
plus i think those styles fit all right i don't it's not for me so imagine i said i'm tired of
realistic graphics i want more cartoon stuff i played this game the other day just had like
real ass people depicted and in my opinion that's enough for me like okay yep that is your opinion
yeah like i'm not gonna challenge that i just yeah all right that's how you feel i'm just gonna discard
it and move along yeah that doesn't mean they shouldn't have done it or that it's in theory a
game as a result of that opinion is subjective even mario better than they do zelda zelda isn't
generally super serious or anything but i think there's a depth of adventure and creativity there
that just doesn't really fit with the whole everything's made of real stuff that's pretty
creative though you said that's nonsense creativity and that's very creative that's nonsense is
this is like the opinion of most opinionists of the opinions but what are you just nonsense like
roll that bag like he's he's saying that like to have realistic exploring doesn't lend itself to
like the plastic feel like what do you mean i need to hear this again better than they do
zelda isn't generally super serious or anything but i think there's a depth of adventure and
creativity there that just doesn't really fit with the whole everything's made of real stuff theme
why he needs to that's just a statement without any i guess yeah evidence to back it up depth
and exploration be lost when you're going into realism have you ever explored a forest in real
life like you can do it isn't uh plastic forest i mean why you could say the exact same thing about
everything is like i don't know if the uh i don't know if the adventurous nature of each mario game
lends itself to uh like like a pixel style you know construction or or whatever you want to call
it like this like why why does it not and how do you justify things like yeah but what about toy
story too where toys are literally made out of plastic going on an adventure like i don't
this is really really weird this is i think you can have an adventure with depth and basically
any format like uh of depiction of media like you'll you'll be fine you can do it in text
adventures does it happen well yeah the implication seems to be that it has less depth because it's
less realistic which is bizarre maybe he's gonna qualify it i wonder if he actually doesn't mean
what he's saying is just expressing himself really poorly like could be the thing saying
the adventure doesn't lend itself like what is what does that mean the adventure doesn't
like it's very strange thing to say so maybe didn't even give it there that just doesn't
really fit with the whole everything's made of real stuff theme in my eyes zelda games really
do take place in some other universe and i don't want them even touching the real world beyond
small innocuous references so the idea that you could be in a different world made of plastic
that's just not a thing for you is is he saying that this is more realistic apparently yeah i mean
i mean i suppose in a way because of like dimensions and stuff like shadows things like
that yeah sure those exist in the real world but that's probably about as far as i'd take it if
we're gonna define that this is kind of like a board game kind of like plastic toys he's like
i guess he's saying like yeah it's almost like this is a thing from our world and i'm like but
it's a it's a fully functioning world in its own it's not there's strings everywhere and stuff but
that's what all games are so it really depends on your level of immersion but why can't you just
imagine that this is an alternate universe everything's made of plastic that's not the
real world yeah and there's a comment in chat that i like uh jay said just jay not jay why
do we have any knowledge that the original game wouldn't have had these kinds of graphics if they
could but were limited by the game boy you know from 1993 yep that's a good thought
it's a reasonable thing to ask and the answer would be no of course not yeah thanks kirby
yoshi and mario have always had this kind of winking self-referential thing going on and
that's great that's great for them what's just wait what does that mean what are you
yoshi's always had winking self-referential stuff what what do you mean by that
well not only what does he mean by that but what is that supporting right now
yeah what does that so things that are self-referential make more sense to be
quite unrealistic or really i'm not sure let's roll that back there are two things that don't
equate in that the winking well i explain how that is even like what what are they doing that has a
wink winking soft referential humor which they might i just didn't see any evidence to say so
and then how does that equate to spitting something that's more i don't know what plastic
or real or how the things is defining is just making a complete logic i like this comment by
louis calibre i'm saying that right um zelda's graphics and art etc have uh is always changing
in its first four games it had three different styles that's consistent to change there's no
definitive zelda style graphics or gameplay not this is just what i mean yeah i agree
yeah it's just what people attach themselves to in some way perhaps what they think is the zelda
style he's arguing that this is the first style he felt that almost takes place in our will versus
thing but wasn't he arguing for realistic this whole time he was that's what i'm getting confused
on how that was a thing and then breath of the wild and what's the other one skyward sword or
whatever yeah like how why would you like could there be a reason why someone would attach
himself or or i think one of those is particularly more realistic than the rest for whatever reason
is he like uh aiming for like the word fantasy meaning like he knew that despite being because
lord dorene's you could argue is like got realism in it but it's complete fantasy right and that's
what maybe he thinks of the zelda uh games and and the the plastic one is like nah this is
this is realistic but not fantasy this is like a kid's board game it's no longer a fantasy
world is that maybe where he's going with this no wolf is saying that that looks too much like
real plastic and not real people and he wants it to look realistic like real people but not
realistic real plastic does that make sense maybe maybe he's confusing things like textures
with effects so shadows and post-processing and ambient occlusion things like that and the
effects that those can have on the textures and the actual things that are in the game
being acted upon maybe there's a maybe he's kind of meshing those two together in a way that he
part less so that it seems to be very he's almost exclusively focusing on the idea of
plastic that's why i'm trying to figure out if it's the um the plastic of our world and he's
like i can't i can't decouple this from that and therefore it's not like a fantasy world it's our
world our plastic it's just a strange uh because because you could easily change by keeping the
shapes the way that they are but or but just changing the texture and the lighting effects on
them it becomes non-plasticy it has this plastic look because it's glossy and waxy and the way it
reflects light and stuff like that so is that is it specifically not anything to do with shapes
or the stylization of objects or any of the you know effects in terms of lighting or whatnot but
just the texture based issue also someone interested contextually this is all in a dream
lynx having apparently it is he uh he like is on a boat and then there's a lightning strike and
then he's yeah it's called lynx awakening because he's asleep it's a dream that kind of would fuck
with his argument too then wouldn't it yeah of course it does because now it's like it's meant
to be surreal and you know if you lived in uh if you lived in a fantasy world where there was no
plastic would be pretty surreal to live in a plastic world like not to say his argument was
strong anyway but if we're going to be saying um it's too close to like real life it's like
but if it's in the dream of a character couldn't it just be anything yeah so yeah not real stuff
theme in my eyes zelda games really take place in some other universe oh um i'm at 11 17
now you're behind all right it doesn't really fit with the whole 11 13 yes right everything's
made of real stuff theme in my eyes zelda games really do take place in some other universe and
i don't want them even touching the real world beyond small innocuous references and gags kirby
yoshi and mario have always had this kind of winking self-referential thing going on and that's
great that's great for them i just don't think that fits zelda similarly i'm not sure if the
style fits the tone of this specific game lake's awakening is a light-hearted game but i've always
felt like it has something of a surreal and uh well dreamlike quality interesting um yeah so he
wants the graphics to look a bit surreal and dreamlike is that what he's been saying i mean
what does that mean it's a little confusing to kind of peg down exactly what he's saying
is he trying to communicate the idea that the image on the left is more of that in the image
on the right that's that's i think that's where my brain got stuck i was like wait which one's more
surreal because he seems to think it's obvious and i'm like oh uh i don't know man like the
original game just looks like a uh what a zelda game would have looked like you know if you have
a link to the past but on the you know gameboy i don't know yeah because i played the um the
gameboy version and i played the nintendo ds redo of it and i was like it was nifty to have
them both ways you know but i don't i this is a it's hard to get what he's trying to say i'm
rolling back see if we can see if we can find something so it's like he's trying to tell us
what he wants but i'm still trying to figure out what he wants roshin mario i've always had this
kind of winking self-referential thing going on and that's great that's great for them i just
don't think that fits zelda similarly i'm not sure if the style fits the tone of this specific
game lake's awakening is a light-hearted game but i've always felt like it has something of a surreal
and uh well dreamlike quality i can see how the toy angle is their way of tackling the dreamlike
tone it sort of sets it apart from other zelda's it makes it feel a little more imaginary a little
more like a story it makes sense on paper and i can see the reasoning but i just feel like it's too
simple and disarming it feels simple and disarming and that's again just his subjective
opinion i feel like it's as like is there any less simple than the one on the left
uh well i mean it's more detailed than the one on the left for sure far more detailed there's more
effect there are literally effects on the right that do not exist on the left yeah like it's more
detailed like a third dimension which means we have to know you know by simple we don't know how
he's defining that yeah there's a weird one yeah because the one on the right is definitely more
complex and then disarm undeniably is it that it's in a plastic world therefore you feel like
nothing's really going to hurt you or something disarming is uh having the effect of allaying
suspicion or hostility especially through charm yeah that's what i mean like he feels safer in
in the plastic world and he thinks he shouldn't feel safe in what kind of the game this is
uh okay it's not like again i was just because he's already described the game as like dreamlike
and yeah he's got a clip they're currently fighting for their life it's like it's disarming
he's like okay he's not giving the best words to describe his views here because well the actual
words themselves like you know green like surreal and what he just recently said wasn't detail
or something uh they're not you know equaling what is intending to say is the problem it's too
detailed or not enough or the fact that it's plastic and the other one is like almost looks
cartoony drawn does that somehow help is there i mean i feel like you can just make these arguments
in reverse if you really wanted to like the one on the left is too simple and disarming
yeah and that would apply yeah a story it makes sense on paper and i can see the reasoning
but i just feel like it's too simple and disarming it feels like it removes some of
that true surrealism and turns it into just another silly kids playing with toys it removes
the true surreal what what what did the original one have that made it more true and surreal
yeah i think this is pretty sneaky he said that um you can see how they've gone this way for
surrealism on paper but it's not really truly surreal and it's like excuse me explain to me
what truly surreal means yes because you've just you've made a claim and you're going to try and
get away with it you can't i'm pulling you right back to that and i gotta admit like the surreal
like how do we even define surreal like just it goes beyond reality right it's pretty much
the easiest way to put it without looking for an actual definition something that makes you feel
like this is this is not reality everything being plastic that's pretty fucking surreal
the proportions i mean and they both look pretty equally surreal and and i just kind of appreciate
how the 3d one is reflecting the proportions and style of the 2d one so accurately it's like
they're very equivalent like in their you know adaptation is what i'm referring to i mean you
could make the argument that the one on the right is far more surreal because it's far more relatable
in a way because it's almost like you recognize this but it's not right yeah yeah like this is
something that's close enough to reality to where i accept it without question even though i can tell
it's not quite as it should be i mean in that sense i mean the fact that there is there seems
to be some kind of atmosphere here again the shadows and the lighting the it very i would
serve and i would say the one on the right is more surreal well yeah because a lot of the time in
dreams everything is normal but there's loads of little bits the the the poke out you're like
that's insane what like someone just clips through a wall and you're like except the oddity is how it
thing should be yeah and you wake up and you're like man that was fucking weird but okay that's
how he feels about it and this is the thing like i wonder if you would consider what we've just done
an attack i'd love to hear him respond to some of this i'd be like yeah let's really get down to it
you've chosen surreal i don't know if you want to stick to it or if you want to say you just
chose it because it felt right at the time but sure explore it with us here we go that's nothing
is his idea of a response not at all addressing what we say but just doubling down on what he
says or only just talking about what he thinks about more because if he wants to be consistent
he can't actually go after what we're saying there's an interesting comment in chat where
someone laughs and says is this a video he made with an idea he had in mind lost it and then just
kept going for ad revenue i think you know like uh when you get down to a specific detail and then
you go back out of it and you have like an umbrella to him and then you go back out of that and
umbrella to him so like someone out of acting out of character can be umbrellaed into there's a
contradiction in the film and that can be umbrellaed out to i didn't like the film and i think he's
he's he's gone like to tier two where he's like yeah these words and he's like he's not thought
about the next tier at all yeah he doesn't think he needs i don't like it i'll keep going i think
it's um it's it's interesting to come at this because this is very like normie first level
kind of discussion about you know media or art or anything like that that's all very wishy-washy
and yeah first level is like you can't even get your thoughts across well yeah and and then you
go sort of second level which is more like you know it's probably more like yes a lot of the
content that's covered on efap where it's uh it's a little bit more reasons the reasons are bad yeah
yeah exactly whereas with this one it's just so nebulous and vague and it's probably because
there's never i don't know maybe it's because when he has discussions about video games he's
talking about it with people who largely share the same overall views well they don't share
yeah yeah exactly and so then it's like because what i mean is it feels like there's a big
disconnect where like if he would have re-watched this stream there'd be a lot of parts where i
guess maybe wouldn't be following the point that's being made not because it's like not not because
like more just because it's probably inexperienced with discussing it on that sort of like to that
extent i guess i don't know but then he made a three and a half hour review of breath of the wild
so it's like i don't know it's very confusing i mean he definitely seems to feel passionately
about a position that i don't think he's quite figured out and that's fine um it's just it's
funny because we like inspect inspect these phrases and words and then we're like
i don't know if this means exactly what you thought it meant maybe it did maybe it doesn't
it's not equating i know but the thing the way he's trying to uh validate his opinion with the
words he's using it's all very vague it's not so definitive in establishing the points he's trying
to make in any way it's all confusing as a result yeah i guess we shall continue that uh one sec
i'd uh the description was doubled up apparently i've singled it now thank you for the
letting me know chat and crafts kirby yoshi paper mario game toys are certainly fun but there's
nothing surreal and mysterious about a toy another oh that's a claim again that's a big
there's nothing surreal about a toy which by definition is not real like yeah
do we even need a counter that one like he's just sweeping claim there's nothing surreal about a toy
yeah that's we don't know what surreal means is he using it as a something feels ethereal maybe
i don't know like yeah there's there's nothing needs to be said about that that's obviously wrong
my brain is like you can counter it this way this way this way this way i'm like i don't
think we need to think it's so evidently a dumb dumb problem is that at least based on what i can
see in the trailer link's awakening does the whole toy thing but it still doesn't quite go
all the way with it making its design look kind of unfocused i know i already said i'm not sure
if the toy thing was the right choice so i should be happy that it's not all toy but this halfway
point is weird in its own special way all the trees look like they came out of plastic molds
these vines look like lego blocks or something but i'm sorry what i'm yeah uh all the trees i
would like to see the lego block that it in any way could be compared to those vines first of all
the trees look like plastic good yep like they came out of plastic molds these vines no hold on
it's the next point that breaks it the one after this one and pauses on the vines can you see them
i'm at 12 30 yes i can but it's the one after this that i know i'm just saying that let's get
a good look at these vines that he said they look like lego blocks that don't look like lego to me
they look like plastic again or maybe even like um lego is plastic yeah he yeah he might be meaning
that they look like that they were clipped together out of different parts if that like
but that adds to the toy part doesn't it yeah it does it does that's why he's leading to the
third point that breaks it that's what i'm saying i remember this look like lego blocks or something
but then lots of other stuff kind of just looks like stuff video game stuff yeah you see what
i mean like that's that's how it's broken because this looks like stuff that texture has the same
kind of sheen in certain places super details yeah it looks like it looks like tile and that's why
he's gone wrong here if those little like um banner things there are like cloth in this game
rather than like a plastic uh sort of um sheets you know whatever um that would still be fine
because you can get plenty of plastic products that come with like paper additions or cloth
additions in in different places like as long as you maintain um the toy aspects yeah like you can
have wax paper you can have metal like that's a thing there's metal on certain toys it's it
doesn't break the look at all this doesn't look like a video gamey thing and actually looks quite
tangible i guess we'll see what he's if he's going to go into more yeah it looks like clay
like a like a claymation yeah i think his criticism is that it doesn't look like
or it doesn't look as if it's made or be as much like plastic as the trees are i think what he's
trying to say is it looks like actual video game graphics as in it doesn't look like it's real
which um i i can't follow because look at those ground textures that's quite detailed
you look nice yeah it looks like yeah like bathroom tile kind of or it's clearly like a
it looks like a floor it looks like he's walking on a floor it's actually really impressive like
that's really impressive work looks gorgeous this game looks great not toys or anything at least
the other games i've mentioned went all out with their ideas and even oh but not this yeah okay
okay told on the toy concept there's a chance that going all out would have at least given
the game a stronger identity of itself it might happen in between i think one big issue he could
have you could have gone into more detail about that he's just like said like a line just moved
on it's like okay yeah like this doesn't have an identity he's like okay i think it's criticism
now is that everything doesn't consistently look like plastic as much which is i don't know if i
agree with him on that i think it looks pretty consistent yeah i'm looking around at this still
here and everything kind of does have that glossy waxy kind of reflection to it or it's made out of
a material that sort of soaks it up and it it doesn't nothing like stands out like it doesn't
belong he's kind of saying it like they've messed up which is kind of hilarious because it doesn't
seem like they've messed up at all with this game when it comes to the graphics you like couldn't
i just make the claim that water shouldn't be here if it's all plastic all plastic water you know
well no that's the thing plastic water is different than water water but i think that it's nice they've
got water water here i don't know even the water looks a bit like it's made from resin which is
what you have on models and you know i think yeah it's uh it all looks really good that's what i
mean i don't i don't agree with this at all um i'm leaning on my bottle here true that i have
is the wasted potential as you might have seen in my pokemon let's go review i'm not a big fan of
square for square remakes of decades old games i need not remind you that this is just personal
sure and i agree that's fine it is no it's not you made some definitive claims here
it's not all subjective what he said oh well i don't know if he falls into the crowd of
you know everything is subjective or not does he do you know i don't know i'm not sure i'm not sure
i think he is sharing this in the context like this is just my opinion kind of thing i think for
the remake thing he is and to an degree i would be with him yeah absolutely but what he said
before was just like everything in this video effectively that's what he said that's like nope
yeah that's that's up for debate that part is i know plenty of people want exactly this this is
what a perfect remake is for them but personally i see no reason why the developers couldn't have
given themselves a little more wiggle room when designing the game or at least like the overworld
the switch is capable of such beautiful graphics nintendo's artists are capable of
now this is just more of like a nitpick right um a lot of nintendo channels have a very warped
perception of graphical fidelity yeah i was about to say it but like breath of the wild is not the
best looking game i've ever seen yeah it looks it looks fine i like the art style but graphically
like it's actually kind of weak um you compare this to god of war you compare this like god of war
and it's not even close yeah it's serviceable sure it's fine but like i said this is more of
a nitpick because a lot of nintendo channels are going oh this is a very good looking game it's
like yes it was a very good looking game like 2012 i would say but i like the way it looks
yeah yeah i i think a lot of them confuse like pure graphical power with style i know that i
don't think they do i think what it is is because they're nintendo channels they're not really
engaging as much with um the other parts of the gaming industry oh but that's just you assuming
the the uh you know origin of their opinion they're free and therefore uh yes it kind of sounded
insecure there it is an assumption um but i think you're right to agree yeah i think you're right
to the thing is it's not really like a big problem it's more of just a thing i've noticed
where you have them say this is a very good look like a very good looking game graphically it's
like i mean for the switch short but yeah it's like someone who only plays on a nintendo ds you
know yeah exactly it's um this is definitely a nitpick this is not a big deal at all
gorgeous designs so why does the grass have to come in perfect no wait wait no no wait he's
messed up there um why they've laid it out that way it's not graphics that's a design choice
yeah yeah that's not going to do with graphical fidelity
that's a choice that's not an aesthetic thing yeah that's a mechanic not an aesthetic
yeah very much adds to the red layout the original version adds the toy well that's the idea it's
it's one to one and yeah it works for that it's um because because the whole point of the tiles
is um it communicates to you very clearly you know the world in very clear terms you know where
everything is these are the boundary this is the space around you which is a bit different for you
know breath of the wild which is trying to be a big open world with 360 degree movement and all
you know all that this is not even all the same and even when you have uh games that have different
levels that are um when you're when you can move in a three-dimensional space in all directions
and things aren't in you know block structure a lot of the times more i for fear of sounding
redundant more structured areas a lot of players prefer that a lot of people would prefer to fight
in a city than in a forest because a city has a kind of organization to it where it's very clear
where you can go and where you cannot go but with a forest there's rocks and trees and bushes and
uneven ground than it you know the pathing is generally it can be a little more difficult so
you know that could be its own thing but it's uh some to consider certainly turn to these vines
again why do they have to be made of these perfect little repeating lego blocks they could have
accomplished all the same snow design no no they couldn't have not the same design no
yeah not design yeah like the aesthetic is part of the aesthetic he could have said maybe even
the aesthetic but from a gameplay design standpoint no it's totally different yeah it will play
similarly made a perfectly faithful remake while still making it feel more organic not realistic
just real within the world more detailed more artful and a swing that's such a bunch of words
right there yeah like i don't even know how to tackle that more artful like oh my that's a word
that's a very subjective morphous word right i just
yeah i need him to lock that word down because it can go a lot of places
back around to the cartooniness thing again cartooniness isn't a problem simplicity is a
problem this game has so much potential to take the original and build it into something beautiful
something that the original developers might have made dude dude dude you're talking beautiful
wow and this is clearly like they want to duplicate the gameplay style yes original
but he's then saying that they shouldn't have done that they should have built it to something
greater and like only keep vague story the same perhaps or something that's not what they were
intending yeah of course they could have done more obviously they didn't accidentally recreate
this game one for one they clearly wanted to take an old game right but just give it that new
coat of paint some new you know better mechanics like you know moving diagonally and stuff like
that you know but it basically has the a similar gameplay to the old classic it's like an homage
in a way yep a tribute i yes if they had the hardware power to do it but this square by square
toy style limits it it brings everything down to a simple toy like which is what it is representation
of the original sprites instead of letting it be as artistically interesting this is pretty fucking
artistically interesting yeah i'm almost in the interest of ejecting it's like he's so he's making
so many claims that are just unfair like this game looks really cool
yeah he lost me when he said they could have done something beautiful
i guess this isn't it you know yeah this yeah this what's this shit
instead of saying how can we make this look better they said how can we make this look
just like the original but in 3d like i said you think this looks like the original but in 3d
are you insane i'm pretty sure he's i'll get against that himself also is proven that is
better it's like trying to say that it's not better but they could have made something better
i was like ah this dude's crazy cray cray bad rap it looks very pretty in its own way
but i also feel like it could be so much more while still completely embodying the tone and
spirit and even the precise design of the original and no tone spirit and precise design
of the original yeah by changing it so much more
none of this is helped by that opening cinematic it is so so gorgeous it really sets up expectations
that the actual gameplay can't quite meet that intro truly does represent can't quite meet
it's not the same thing what what do you think they were this what starters is unfair because
this is a 2d animation like yeah what are you asking them to do here like how are they meant
to make it look like this like the the gameplay can't live up to this is like this can't live
up to the gameplay now what yeah now what they're too completely they're not meant to well this is
the intro cinematic so yeah yeah original game i can imagine using this beautiful painterly style
that really does the tone justice and turns the world the tone does the tone justice and i know
this video is absolutely packed with agains and like i said but again like i said i get what they
were going for as many people have pointed out the intro is a direct agreement i don't think you do
i like how we're so deflated at this point yeah there's so much to criticize that i'm almost like
i can't do it like there's just too much wrong with this he's not really said much of anything
uh definitive the proof this provable is so many words that are just like
big left on the table and i'm like what's this one what's this one what's this one yeah
and then it also becomes down to such a subjective opinion on what he feels the game should be like
and therefore it would have been i don't like the should i don't like the should it should
be like this this is how the game should look yeah should implies that you have an end goal
or an end thing that you want right you're trying to get to something or you're trying to what is
that what is that end goal because it seems like the end goal was to make a very faithful recreation
of the gameplay style of the original in 3d and that it looks like they achieve that really
effectively right his end goal is what i like seems like it and i still don't know what that is
like of the original intro then kind of separately the main game is a direct remake of the original
main game if that original sprite link were converted to 3d this is what he would probably
look like this style is absolutely accurate but remember when everyone was crazy about watchmen
and then the watchmen movie came out and besides the detail in the ending the vast majority of the
movie was like shot by shot constructed directly from panels in the original graphic novel
and that didn't make it a good movie like at all this is the this is the adaptation argument this
is a false equivalence as well a massive false equivalence yeah movie is not the same as a game
okay the interactive nature of a game's mechanics are impossible to ignore and they
just they they separate the mediums in an extremely meaningful way massively so not to
mention yeah you are trying to oh yeah i guess so he's referring to this new game as an adaptation
of the old game and just because you've correctly because that's why he's defined it he's correctly
updated the um but that's not what he's saying he's suggesting that because you've adapted it
faithfully and that you've you've taken all the things that were there before and made them to new
things doesn't mean it's going to be good i'm curious why he's showing the shining what's he
going to say about this how about when steven king didn't like staying with different adaptation
of the shining because despite being a vastly superior piece of fiction in every possible way
don't at me oh wolf would have weeks wolf would have lots of years he said it was vastly superior
in every single way that sounds pretty objective to me do that but he said don't at me it's just a
joke calm down yeah yeah i i could throw that in at the end it's a joke don't act i'm not actually
you should do it at the end of your game of thrones video mauler don't at me and it's like
cool you realize don't at me is just the end of the sentence version of in my opinion well even
though in my opinion you can fucking go there too i thought well i don't at me it's just like don't
hate me for having stating something like that i can't believe i'm saying this it's complicated
don't at me as in like this is my position i'm not going to entertain the idea of uh people
fighting against it we all have our opinions leave me alone yeah and it's also used as like a
jokey way of saying i know what i said was controversial yeah um no i should say don't
at me after i can get my apple and peep that got it yeah don't at me guys i really the fucking
mantra of efap is every sentence ends with at me go ahead when steven king didn't like stanley
kubrick's adaptation of the shining because despite being a vastly superior piece of fiction
in every possible way don't at me it wasn't accurate enough so then he wrote his own screenplay
which they made into the most perfectly accurate tv miniseries based on a book ever and it was like
the worst movie watching that movie was like okay i can't stand what he's saying here that if it's
going to be accurate to the source material it seems like he's implying it's going to be inherently
bad and i'm like i know i'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he's trying
to counter the notion that if it's accurate it's better yeah that's what i'm getting uh but i will
say that i guarantee you there's so much context we're not getting from what he's provided us i
don't believe him i don't believe that the tv series is bad because it's accurate to the fucking
books i'm sure there's way more to it than that filling coffee on yourself and having to sit in
it for four hours it was miserable i'm not saying link's awakening will turn out like watchmen or the
shining tv movie i wouldn't even make a joke about that that's going too far i'm just saying that
accuracy shouldn't always be the end goal of a remake i think capturing the spirit of the
original and expanding on it overall improvement should be the goal all right so improvement is
okay so improvement is objective complicated to see improvement when it comes to art style
yeah like what's he mean like is yarn an improvement from plastic is plastic an improvement
from realism is realism an improvement from cartoon i like star wars more than pride and
prejudice and so if i was making a pride and prejudice adaptation into film and make it like
basically one for one new hope is that an improvement again for some people it will be
but it's strayed so far from what the source material was it's no longer an adaptation it's
something completely different and so there is certain things that you must keep the same for
it to actually remain the same thing and so his guard here is just to improve something like no
people like the original for very specific reasons and you need to keep those things in place
for people to maintain that same level of like
the
early expansion in terms of gameplay i'm perfectly fine with the gameplay remaining mostly the same
which is why if that final fantasy seven remake ever comes out which it probably won't i'm staying
away from it because it sounds like they're reimagining it into a new game entirely there
are some cases where revamping it like a new game yeah yeah this is this is like a new game
we're in weird territory like again yeah it's about intention the final fantasy remake the whole
intention is to make it like uh you know a platformer a modern day platformer and so they're
completely redoing the gameplay whereas with zoda the whole intention behind it was to maintain the
gameplay if if this was the attitude that he was going to be consistent with and sorry peter jackson
with your lord of the rings yeah i don't know there's so many variables that i'm almost lost
like again like so what is his even argument for games being easily he's almost arguing for how
they're you know you could do anything could result better i'm just like okay thanks for adding this
to the conversation like i a one-to-one remake one-to-one just the graphics get boosted almost
like a remaster instead it's like well doesn't yeah i'm okay with that but i'm also okay with
uh a remake as well like this is a difference between something like the crash bandicoot
trilogy and um uh rez and evil 2 remake well and rez and evil one remake i guess it's like
these are different things isn't the whole point that we have remake and remasters two different
terms would you call would you call this zoda one a remaster a remake remake it's a remake yeah
a suit well i mean i can't be sure if everything is the same i was gonna say if the mechanics and
the the world everything's the same except the graphics then i guess it would be a remaster
of source yeah but i think with um i but i think with the idea of stuff like diagonal movement
i mean even that in and of itself is pretty a pretty substantial you know change and i'm not
sure what else they do but even that alone is like yeah this brings into question then exactly what
the line between remaster remake is and it can get complicated if you have a remaster that changes
any one mechanic is it now a remake yeah i'm not ready to i mean i don't have a huge investment in
it uh the difference between the two but i would imagine that the the further and further the more
and more changes that it makes the closer it gets to remake and there's a couple of differences or
big differences uh between the final fantasy one and zoda one i mean we have a lot of different
other zoda properties exploring different gameplay styles and stuff like that from the
older zelda forms and stuff and this is like a nod back to the original but with final fantasy
seven i mean it's like it's a time to explore with these characters in a new gameplay style
that everyone is really keen to see and stuff i don't know maybe if they did a remaster of the
original people would still be on board with it as well and if they were going for a remaster then
um we would hope to the gameplay to be maintained in a very faithful way but yeah i think if they
did that and they said this is a remaster of the original legend of zelda we'd be like all right
same exact game mechanically identical just updated graphics i think people would really like to try
that but if they framed it as oh yeah the next official zelda game it's this and it was that
honestly step backwards people would obviously have issues you know it's how you treat it and
what you're trying to do and yeah what expectations you set up for it as well yeah yeah
i think a lot of stuff is a good idea like with samus returns but it depends on each individual
case and now i'm getting too deep into something that is not the point the point is that at least
in this specific case i am happy with the gameplay being basically the same but i feel like the art
style could be so much more whether it's with painterly visuals or simply with damn what do
you want if this is if this disappoints you like fuck man you have some pretty high stand if he was
here right now and just said no sorry i'm just saying i i i don't i have a preference against
plastic looks i'd be like okay okay okay but he seems to keep wanting to save all the bat
like he wants to be like oh yeah yeah i think it's definitely more than just i don't like the
textures doesn't convey the ethereal nature that this game originally implied
tailed artistic yet still completely colorful and cartoonian fun 3d graphics just not factory made
plastic trees and copy pasted plant models and that's really unfair to the workers gone into
this clearly yeah this game looks like it oh it looks like it's got so much heart he's describing
a pet peeve and you know that's fine if he doesn't like that okay yeah no i'm almost making
like a moral judgment on him there that's my personal preference why is he question his
judgment i just i don't know why he's attacking these things instead of just convincing us of
what he wants no oh so how should you do that it's like his mind blown temporarily it's like oh god
it's like this video shit black tiny sheens that makes some things look like plastic even though
they're not plastic or they are maybe you calling them plastic was wrong to be honest and there's
one last thing i've got to say about opinions and art styles and stuff because i don't know when
it'll come up again even if you think it is wrong to dislike this art style even if you think people
have the wrong wrong to dislike it okay it's not wrong who said that like who says these things
yeah is that people say the game isn't bad because it has an art style you don't like is
like i think that would be the appropriate response but they're not saying it's wrong to dislike well
i don't know who would say that i'm i'm sure if you could find someone out there but at that point
you're like why even talk about them and we also have to find out if they were just joking around
because what you can probably quote us as saying it but it's usually gonna be sarcastic yeah i think
it is wrong to dislike this art style even if you think people have the wrong reasons for disliking
it or if you think it's wrong for a person to not play the game because they don't like the art style
it doesn't matter well let's put it this way what if your reason for disliking this art style is
literally because it was uh developed on a friday or you were beaten with a plastic doll when you're
younger yes okay it's like what is like um is that the wrong reason to dislike and this is getting
into the whole what makes a reason right or wrong he's like is it justified as he said a reasonable
reason or what did he say was that what he said i can't remember like earlier in the video he
described and i and i said like oh implying that there are unreasonable reasons
oh yes that's right are some reasons more reasonable than others
you know like well i feel that um because of the i don't know some because of the socioeconomic
impacts of the devastation of the japanese empire following world two i feel like this
texture in the zelda video game doesn't uh you know i don't like it because of that reason
and then someone else says well i don't like it because i feel like there are certain assets
that don't fit in aesthetically with other assets like which one of those is more reasonable of the
two for not liking you know the textures of the zelda game i like how um when he spun the sword
it's like warped the visuals underneath it yeah it has that is really nifty it's like it's yeah
that's really cool that's opinions dude people can dislike anything for any reason they want
there was once a time when i thought that all the other yeah stop saying that nobody's claiming
it's illegal you're all right it's not illegal not yet yes stop fucking bringing this up
teenagers around me who were skipping out on wind waker because of the style were so ignorant
and wrong but now i know it didn't matter whatever so we've just we pros be like okay you're lost
if you really want to be like any kind of so if someone said like i'm not gonna play god of war
because i don't like bald people i'd be like whatever man your deal okay they were perfectly
within their right something too many within their right i hate when people do this no one's
taking it right away who is taking your right away to not like zelda video game aesthetics
who who is this person if you're not going to tell us then you're yeah
yeah this is stupid this is not only do different people enjoy sorry i didn't mean to play it
um no it says that he's he's he's trying to set up a defense for himself against people that
essentially don't exist yeah because of the style were so ignorant and wrong
but now i know it didn't matter they were perfectly within their right something too
many people don't seem to understand is that not only do different people enjoy different things
but sometimes they enjoy the same things for this is this is like preachy kindergarten garbage
that i don't expect the internet no welcome to life like this is the opening people like
different things and that's okay that's your right everyone it's like a kindergarten teacher
just on her knees you know going down a little timmy's level just to explain them face fail
sometimes little timmy people like different things like fuck off we're adults you're an adult
it is your government given god given cosmos given right to enjoy zelda all right but we will say
there is a difference between liking something and saying something is objectively good and if
they felt that semantically they were just that's all that meant saying objectively good
oh whatever just like just i wish you'd just explain what you're saying because it sounds like
garbage there could be a person who enjoys games purely based on how good their music is
that person is not wrong same with voice acting or character models or color and you're yes even
graphics a lot of people he's he's really he's it's that joke we made where like major lee is
just fucking thrashing this straw man and you're like you got it good job and we're over here like
all right yep you showed him yeah it's like a big anime fight is you know charged up as attacks
just he just blasts through the chest of the straw man with this blank face it just it's just
like yep whenever you're done we're over here even the store man's like i wasn't a particularly
good point anyway so yeah you're doing me a service i don't even know what you're talking about
people seem to think that playing games based purely on graphics is the mark of the stupidest
person ever a person who doesn't even like or understand games but it's not they're just liking
what they like you could have a person who just loves rocks how good do the rocks look how many
rocks are there can you pick up the rocks these are the metrics by which they judge the quality
some crazy person out there thinks that okay why are we talking about i don't even know why we're
on this now like yeah sure everyone can like anything for any reason that's a crazy thought
so does he dislike the links awakening remake overall because of the art style like he hasn't
played it yet this came out before the game came out so he probably has played it now what has he
said about it he said that he just didn't like the art style and there's not interest in the game
and people any flack for it he's gonna play the game he's a nintendo channel he's definitely
played the game um if i was being as kind as possible i would say he made a video explaining
that he doesn't like the art style because it doesn't match the surreal nature of zelda
and there's uh it's almost inconsistent with itself as well but he'll give it a shot
and that everyone can like anything they want people are close-minded if they disagree with him
and assume his reasons for just liking the art style that is the best faith version of what we
have heard in this video yes we give it up a lot of leeway considering all the things he said
because yeah a lot of it was vague using really weird some of it was outright wrong
but all right with it is based purely on rocks that that is very different from how i
have a mundane matter probably use that as a reason i guess as chat's pointing out
it's a really great rocks to collect i don't know measure games i just don't have the same tastes
as that person and their standards even seem a little silly to me but it doesn't matter wow
what you just said was no no less power we need less of those people we need less people judging
a video game quality and enjoyment based on rock textures we need less of those people but he said
that he thought those people's standards was silly that's an attack yeah how dare you call
someone standard silly more power to him let him enjoy their rock games and you can't tell them
that they're wrong or they're playing you can tell somebody yeah so what if someone legitimately
does not like a game because it had too many black people in it you can totally say that they morally
wrong you could make a moral judgment yeah i would say that would be wrong yeah um well the
thing is though is i feel like if you said this you'd be like yeah but we're obviously not talking
about that we're just talking about video but it's like no we're trying to test the principle
because it's funny we have said you're allowed to like you know whatever you want as long as
you're not saying well we're appealing to the ability yeah but i mean i think i want a question
that i was saying to say if you're i mean i think it's fair to um uh try and critique the
reasons why someone likes it to see if it's valid or not i mean i'm generally interested in knowing
why people like things that i think are horribly bad and if someone just said they liked a horrible
movie because it had good rocks in it i'll be like uh you're right yeah you're okay quite in person
yeah all right um okay you know but i well this is the thing about something else because
you're just interesting the thing about the rocks though is like what if you had a friend who was
like an extremely well-versed um i don't know if there's a specific uh profession for this but
let's just go with archaeologist oh yeah there you go sorry that would work better so like and it's
just a game that's hyper realism adventure game and there's loads of extremely well-rendered
variations of different rocks and rock related uh you know items objects or whatever and you can
catalog them dig them out and there's like elements of mechanics to it and it's like i
fucking love this game because of the rocks you'd be like yeah that makes sense it doesn't mean
it's a good game no that's true too or that it is generally enjoyable for more common reasons yeah
yeah rock games man underrated
wrong reasons you don't know them you're not in their head you just don't have the same tastes
and priorities as them and i know what a revelation well crazy it's almost like you said that a million
times already i had no idea i'm so glad there's so many creators make this video and it's such
a boring fucking take hey man it's subjective wow people are different oh shit this whole
time i thought that everyone yeah don't you dare assume the reasons why they hold such opinions
because that's being closed-minded and oh yeah yeah it's an art style art fine but they are
secondary to good gameplay superfluous even but video games are a visual medium if someone doesn't
want to play a game because they don't like how it looks you can not convince me that that's
unreasonable i know i've turned down games because i didn't like how they looked i don't
want to stare at something that i think is ugly for 10 to 20 hours i've disliked how a game
looked then didn't end up coming around five years later as some people seem to insist will
happen with lake's awakening i still think skyward sword is one of the ugliest zelda games not
because it's different or because it's colorful but because i don't think it looks very good
oh it's a tautology isn't it it's ugly because it doesn't look good
but like yeah yeah not playing something because you don't like the way it looks that's fine i mean
there's a lot of games nobody's nobody's making this argument like yeah like um fucking it up though
yeah you may like you know stop with the fluff just say i don't like it because i don't like
it because i don't like it because i don't like it you're like right right yeah okay i got it nope
that's fine that's okay to hammer it home you've just got to remember that you're not the thought
police it is not your job to make sure everyone no it is my job fuck you this is the internet that
is my job that is my eternal calling it was a part of our career actually like there is there is
a big difference in saying i don't like the art style to the art style is bad because it doesn't
match the ethereal nature of zelda or something hang on because that's what he was saying he's
been saying far more like um definitive statements as to why the art style is legitimately not good
for the style of game that it is and that's a lot different to just him saying i don't like the art
style yeah sorry is being a little disingenuous and trying to summarize this video as him just
simply saying i'm not going to play the game because i don't like the art style it's different
job to make sure that everyone plays every single game that they might end up enjoying
because to not play those games would be an injustice who cares man if you ever hear the
phrase you do you because it's something of a mantra that i've been living by in
oh my god how many times you can already that's that's definitely hypocritical like what do you
mean this whole video is a response to things that have annoyed you not to mention that uh
you don't do you depending on what you're doing yeah you do you unless you are challenging
spon's opinion you walked by you walked away Auschwitz and you're like ah you do you you do
christ not how i would have handled the handles all jews but you know you do you man that's you
know that's one way to do it i guess well that's what i mean like that this is very easy to say
but like you do you i don't think anybody really believes that either i feel like that's another
thing that is a lie everyone's like like everything everybody do your own thing
anarchy it's just nonsense sanity he's like everybody stop doing you we gotta stop
if you haven't clicked away already here's a here's a really big one that i see literally
every day very often in literally every day and please pay attention here because this is
really important an opinion doesn't become a complaint just because you disagree with it
an opinion doesn't become a complaint because you disagree with it well surely a opinion is
a complaint if there is a complaint being made right like what does he mean by this
opinion doesn't become a complaint because just because you disagree with it no wouldn't
it be a complaint before that it's a complaint either way you could agree with it but it's still
complaint wait this room is way too cold I agree those are both still
complaints what if someone says I love this movie I disagree I think well no I
can't disagree with them not liking the movie so hang on well this is very
complicated right because I was gonna say is great I could highlight for example
like something of a Gandalf wearing sneakers and a scene in all the rings I
go oh he's wearing sneakers in all the rings that's my that's my judgment right
there that's my opinion when someone goes disagrees with it and says they're
actually I don't know some other shoe the idea that I'd be like it's not a
complaint it's like it's an observation I guess I don't know what does he mean
but complain like a thing that actually personally annoys me that I'm trying to
go I'm gonna say like if I enjoy something but can notice a flaw in it
and is that necessarily a complaint or an observation or it's a statement that a
situation is unsatisfactory or unacceptable okay it really depends on
the opinion really yeah and he's basically trying to say an opinion isn't
necessarily complaining about something even if you disagree with it
well it's like those things don't have anything whether you agree with it is a
complaint then yeah but like you say this movie is great and someone disagrees
with that it doesn't turn what they said into
complaint yeah but like that's that's obvious though isn't it cuz that's how
language works why I'm getting confused is like yeah why is he comparing two
things he's done this multiple times in this video but he's taking two things
that don't counter each other or really have anything to do with each other in
any way and like trying to link them together like complaint and agreeing
with it it's like no whether you agree with it or not it's still a complaint
that has nothing to do with it
let's see what he says like it's funny how someone can say how much they like
something and everyone nods their heads and thinks it's great but then that
person criticizes something and so wait yeah okay so I understand so like but in
the reverse would he say that just because you agree with an opinion that
doesn't mean it's an appraisal yeah right exactly it's he's got a mixed up
well I just I don't know they're like I'm trying to figure this out do I agree
with this I don't think so I don't know that whether or not you agree with it
doesn't change what the words mean as far as I'm aware so if I like what
defines a complaint this is always weird this is wages like saying this horse is
four legs even if it's Saturday yeah but also it could be Sunday too and the
horse would have four legs yeah and why are we even talking about this these two
things don't have anything to do with each other this is weird stretching this
out a lot this video is the only goal here is to just be like leave everyone
alone to say whatever they want it's like okay just say that I'd still say no
but at least it'd be shorter right yeah you get people going stop complaining
stop whining if it's done respectfully it's just expressing an opinion like any
opinion and I know this is just based on my personal experience with this whole
fuck's sake he just he just said like all of this is my opinion about opinions
being just my opinion but I've seen like no one quote-unquote complaining about
the art style I see people yeah because it's really awesome I'm sure someone is
I mean you are you're complaining I'm sure they're out there but generally this
seems to be a very welcome aesthetic that people enjoy looking what he means
when he says he hasn't seen people complaining what he means is I haven't
seen people like whinging and crying about it they've just been expressing
their opinion like I did that's what he means what does what does it mean to be
a complaint from his eyes yeah that's where we need to understand the
definition crying about his you know opinion about the art style are not
complaints and people have accused him and sold him well I mean yeah this is
obviously complaining about it when there's obviously yeah clearly people
can equate that is complaining if you're criticizing it doesn't make it valid or
invalid I just think he doesn't want to be seen as a
complainer because he doesn't like the art style yeah that is being a
complainer what would you define complaint more how would you define it
well basically what rags read out as a definition sounds reasonable enough to
me a statement that a situation is unsatisfactory or unacceptable no no no
what I've been doing is something else but those complainers out there oh god
it's just so bizarre it's just too wishy-washy there's so many words so
many different words and usually I don't mind words it's that is not using the
words in the correct definition and context and sorry it makes everything
vague and nebulous yeah the point of words is to is to essentially reverse
mind read and he's been doing that very poorly I do not understand what's going
on in his head really it's it's all over the place it's contradictory he's not
applying the same standard to himself that he applies to others this is just
this video does this is like a three and a half four minute video that he is
just draggin out and quite frankly I'm sick of looking at the same footage over
and over I'm gonna do the thing that he doesn't like people doing here goes I'm
gonna do it I think that he's a little bit insecure slash bitter from all the
responses he's been getting after he's been making statements like he has in
this video publicly and that he's frustrated that he's getting clamped
down on this when people who are positive about it won't be when I think
you'll find that it happens to both sides so if someone said this is an
amazing look perfect for Zelda some guy might be like perfect for Zelda I think
you'll find is probably the least suitable thing in that could happen to
Zelda and then that person could be like why is it that when I have a positive
opinion people criticize it's like it still happens still happens principally
it's allowed to happen on both sides it's not that it's not allowed to happen
on either side that's bullshit yeah especially when you're going way further
than just saying I dislike it or I do like it oh yeah but hey that's just a
game theory I don't actually know that as true so it's not an attack okay that
was my guess that's my assumption don't at me do not put the ass on me do not
do it do not shift to at me I got a piece of art and I don't like what I see
sometimes even I don't like it and here's why the ones who are doing what
could be described as complaining are the ones telling people that it's wrong
to dislike the art style the people going there someone actually told you
that it's wrong to dislike the art style yeah like I'm sure this I don't
believe that would have whatever I just like they really phrasing it that way
what why are you giving such time attention and weight to these fringe
crazy people if they even do exist I just find it funny that is literally
trying to redefine the meaning of complain
this is what it means to complain people
they're all wrong this is Wind Waker all over again in five years they'll
love it that's complaining it's complaining when you try to make the
word at your point of view by getting in people's faces I like that he's like
presenting his ideas for what complain means please adopt them it's like I
don't think anyone's gonna be adopting that dude no this is just like he's
doing redefining complain to be being an asshole in different like ways like
it let's just let's do that again listen to his his his defining tubes or doing
what could be described as complaining are the ones telling people that it's
wrong to dislike the art style the people going they're all wrong this is
Wind Waker all over again in five years they'll love it that's complaining it's
complaining when you try to make the world fit your point of view by getting
in people's faces about how you think it should be and before you say it that
just makes you obnoxious yeah but also like that doesn't that doesn't stand up
to scrutiny because there are a lot of instances like the American Revolution
God why are you so obsessed with this complicated what's your taxes don't
complain Wow guys don't complaining God like I need to ask him now is like can
someone make a complaint that you would consider to be a good thing it doesn't
seem like it complaint is negative yeah he's like man I really wish I wasn't a
slave those Nazis killing the Jews was really bad and I can't stand it yeah I
think they're kind of got a little complaining oh damn it yeah it's the
same man I wish that I wasn't poor and I wish I had food to eat or I wish I
wasn't a slave or I wish I didn't have cancer you know just stop complaining we
said like something about trying to impose you your view on other people and
I know he's referring to liking or disliking video games but I was like you
could extrapolate that principle by good man don't think you want to yeah someone
someone in chat said he's literally complaining that people aren't
complaining right before you say it I think there's a big difference between
aiming criticism at a company or a piece of art and talking about how you think
it would be better if it were different and going out of your way to tell people
how you think they should well you think that there's no place on the end
of that that's gonna receive that you think there's no person who made that
fucking art style it's not gonna be a little bit pissed off about your
complaints also like this logic like if you complain against the company it's
okay what but if you complain against people it's not better or different in
the form of a complaint as well like man this really derailed in the end not
that it was all right but you know I mean no be different that's really at
the core of all this have all the opinions you want say them all you want
stop saying that all you want it's not even a good position to hold like no no
I have untenable positions yeah contradictive opinions what happens
then that was good that's good yeah man like opinions can be shitty I know there
were people that started with the letter and they had opinions it's just
opinions man but once you try to force an opinion on someone else or you assume
that a different opinion what does it mean to force an opinion on someone else
am I strapping these people down and blasting it speakers into the correct
that somebody's made an opinion in error he says it like that's not possible but
it is honestly make mistakes and if someone helps you out with that that's a
good thing like man I hated the fourth Matrix movie you're like dude there was
no well they'll change but you know what I mean it must have been made in
error you've crossed the line this information feel free to inform them if
always I said they're spreading misinformation you could inform them
okay what if I think you're spreading misinformation oh come on I think you're
spreading it with we're veering really close to only do it when I think it's
okay okay my standards are don't they don't exist I just don't have them they
they're on a thing so if I was gonna take the really controversial position
of yeah you can challenge opinions and it doesn't even have to be whether you
think the person is lying or not spreading this information oh he's still
my heart someone is harassing the people around them feel free to call that
person out interjection and confrontation have their places but if
someone expresses a personal opinion about a piece of media tell them how you
disagree offer your own opinion as a means of discussion but let them have
what do you mean it doesn't make sense let them have their opinion how how could
anybody not let someone have opinions in the world like really bad opinions like
how am I meant to take it away from someone I guess you don't like you pull
out of what a brain that holds that opinion do you like flush it just hit
the reset button on the brain damn how many times has he said that this is he
wrote the fucking the the Declaration of Independence with John Adams about the
part where you're allowed to like the last Jedi didn't he he was there all I
was in the background be mature be confident in your own opinion discuss
don't discuss don't argue about seeing you I fucking guarantee you if I was to
discuss anything with him it would take a matter of minutes from to argue for
something a discussion can be an argument they're not like exclusive
stop demonizing arguments it's weird arguments can be good arguments can be
discussions he's saying that now because he's got a position that he doesn't he is
not confident in it he does not think he can justify it to people if they ask him
you're assuming you're assuming the reason why he also assume the people
insecure I know he crossed the line well before we even considered crossing it
yeah he crossed the line which means he's on my side and we play by my rules
on my side his rules don't make any sense anyway he clearly defines arguing
as something aggressive and you know throwing names of each other being a
meaner than basically this is what I mean I find it hilarious people like
stop being so mean it's like but I've so often seen people be like actually
incredibly mean and like try to hide it what is he said about is called people
ignorant he's called them ignorant insecure yeah immature um yeah and then
the basis for that like was if you assumed the reasons for someone putting
an opinion your close-minded ignorant well simultaneously arguing for being a
man who's like you do you it's like yes you do you accept fucking all these
different things yep them have their opinion be mature be confident in your
own opinion discuss don't argue and most importantly at all remember I'm gonna be
at Midwest gaming classic in Wisconsin that's over all right we did it oh and
just in time are you gonna go absolutely like fine I have to leave in
like five minutes what about you shed how you doing I'm pushing through guys
the kids will be home soon so you might hear shadowings in the background for a
bit but the plan was right to three videos tangly but two of them were
responding videos one of them was gonna be a video where we just sort of watch
it and obviously you can pause if you find a place to disagree in it but it's
actually a video that I quite liked so instead I think we're gonna go with the
one video to respond to since that would took us just over four hours so
we're gonna skip ahead to the one that we're just gonna watch and the other
video I had we can save for another time this will always have other times to be
able to do this so no worries but yeah I guess do you want to eject now for me
or do you want to oh yeah sure might as well then what was the other responding
video I'm interested the title of it is objectively good doesn't exist no damn
but obviously I was like a half hour so we can't do that as well that one will
take four hours that'll be a full episode and I want to be there for that
one well this was the video that you said you wanted to be there for the last
efap so I will make a note look at that I thought the one we just watched was
that's what I mean the this so you know you on the last efap you wanted to be
here for this one and you are and now you're gonna be there for the next one
when we get to it which you will I promise but yeah freeing Jonah which
which channel do you want to plug the most your regular channel my regular
channel so what is it that you do on this regular channel nothing for the
last year and a half maybe that will change soon keep an eye out well that's it I got nothing else for now
yeah that was fun to some extent fucking oh we got a shit ton of discussion out
of it thank you Arlo yeah and I always feel obliged to say that you know
nothing against you personally you're probably a really friendly nice guy that
we get along with fine and play video games it doesn't mean we're attacking
you because we disagree with some of the things you say yeah we will catch you
again sometime I'm sure of it yeah catch the light the gentleman goodbye sir
that's right so this other video is made by a guy who I believe is a fan of
efap don't want to be assuming too much you know yeah but he made a video and
this is funny enough to be I'm just like whoa this is quite a bold of you the
title of it is art is not subjective very very bold but yeah so the idea here
is I'm gonna we're gonna watch it and then I'll probably talk about if we
pause we can just explore some stuff maybe maybe not and at the end of it
then I'll just talk about who made it and where you can find the video so is
everybody good to objectively okay I gotta take care of something I'll be
back in just a little bit but it I'll be gone for just a little bit like 10
minutes 10 20 maybe
is it possible to do this thing after you see this video or no uh sure yeah if
yeah I think yeah okay cool cuz me and Sha can just talk about this then we'll
be fine okay all right here we go like I said I don't know how much pausing we
will actually do but feel free to objectively bad an objective badness
based on quantifiable unbiased facts and science and mathematics and hold on I
need to check something real quick yeah no all of my crazy pills are still here
I haven't taken any of them so why does it feel like I'm taking crazy pills
cuz it really feels like I'm taking crazy pills here's the thing art is
subjective I'll film a subjective all art is subjective art is subjective art
is not a science there is no means to universally or factually prove worth and
arguably that is why art has any value in the first place isn't it subjective
no a comment that I hear more and more in modern video essays is the statement
art is subjective so I wonder if he's gonna go and explain what's that I would
respond to so many of those interesting takes oh yeah I'll wait I'll wait and
hold off to hear what he says because just hearing so much of that crap before
just kind of you know makes my leg jerk I wouldn't recommend listening to
Quentin reviews it does hit this statement is usually used as a counter to
the idea that film criticism is based on objective references and that a film
can be quantified objectively for quality people who support the idea that
artists objective claim that people who support objective criticism harm art by
limiting the discussion I would support the opposite the concept that art is
entirely subjective and uses no objective standards is a concept which
is immensely harmful to both artists and art critics whether it is writing
directing sculpting painting or creating a video essay every form of art uses
standards and can be qualified objectively the first thing that must
be established is that objective does not necessarily mean factual so he said
that I hope he elaborates on a bit more when he says that trying to claim all
artists objective is actually harmful to because that's a good statement but I
think it deserves to explain why yeah and I'm like you watch this video does he
go on to explain why I'll be honest with you I can't remember everything that
happens in this video but I'm gonna guess I think he does okay it simply
means that your reference used for assessing a film was based solely on
what is in the text of the film whether it's a merit or a flaw you make an
observation based on a reference and form a logical conclusion based on that
reference take the fight on Titan from Infinity War for instance most people
who see this fight scene will enjoy it thoroughly it brilliantly uses CGI in a
convincing way and manages to balance a large number of protagonists fighting
one incredibly powerful antagonist there are several objective merits you
can point to such as character progression through action choreography
direction and more these objective references can be used to make a
conclusion on the film's overall quality and these references can also have an
influence on your subjective take on the film but an objective flaw in this fight
scene is that Thanos does not use the reality stone to incapacitate all the
Avengers so that he can easily take the time stone there are arguments as to why
Thanos wasn't able to overpower the Avengers when he had all of the stones
the key reference which could be used to explain this is that Thanos had just
murdered his daughter Gamora and in a slight ways become softened by this
thus he wishes to go out of his way to avoid killing anyone until he can use the
completed Infinity Gauntlet based on his fighting style in previous scenes
versus his fighting style as soon as he arrives on Titan this does seem to be
the case on both Titan and Wakanda Thanos has the power stone which has the
ability to decimate every member of the Avengers and the Guardians of the
galaxy but Thanos always uses the stone to incapacitate rather than kill the
Avengers the only members of the Avengers that Thanos actively attempts
to kill our vision who had a stone he needed and Tony Stark since Tony fought
Thanos one-on-one and refused to get out of his way between him and Doctor
Strange but if Thanos wanted the most efficient way to incapacitate the
Avengers without killing them he could have used the reality stone just like he
used it on nowhere the reality stone is shown in the film to have the ability to
transform people into blocks of stone and strips of spaghetti this is an
incredibly powerful and useful resource which Thanos inexplicably overlooks
instead he uses it to convert the rubble Tony crashes onto him into demonic birds
I'm just gonna pause for safety because I don't know if live streams are more
detectable with copyright but just being careful you know just another
explanation as to why Thanos you know isn't using the reality stone is that he
might actually enjoy fighting and toying with people a bit and let them struggle
to beat him even though he knows he doesn't have a chance I like that
explanation but it's tough to maintain it when this is his life's goal that
he's in front of right now and I'm like I don't know if you leave it up to the
fight he's gonna be that's that's true yeah cuz it does seem at one point there
was a point where risk losing it when now and he has just highlighted that he
does use the reality stone it's true it's true so it's not a strongest
argument and briefly changes Titans landscape thematically there is no
reason that Thanos wouldn't use the reality stone on Titan and Wakanda on a
production standpoint the reason he doesn't do this is because it would mean
that Thanos would easily be able to overpower the Avengers at the end of the
film this would make the end both hopeless and uneventful in spite of this
Thanos not using the reality stone is an objective flaw which affects the fight
sequences with his character late in the film my assessment of this flaw was
not based on my personal opinion it was based solely on references in the film
this is the difference between a subjective assessment and an objective
assessment there is a difference between someone enjoying a film and someone
saying that a film is good enjoying a film simply means that you had fun in
the theater and overall we're not bored or offended by a film mixing the idea of
objective and subjective takes on films is why many modern video essays can
become confusing I've seen a lot of statements like this in recent video
essays I want to tell you why I love it because I do I think this movie is
goddamn incredible it is easily the best Star Wars movie since the Empire Strikes
Back and today we're gonna talk about why what Patrick Williams has just done
in this quote is combine the objective and subjective into one take he opens
saying that he liked The Last Jedi this statement is entirely subjective it only
means that he enjoyed the film but in the next sentence he makes an entirely
different statement arguing for quality it is easily the best Star Wars movie
since the Empire Strikes Back the title of the best Star Wars movie is a
statement which relates to objective criticism because the word best in this
case pertains to quality his statement expanded with more words is I personally
think The Last Jedi is incredible it is the best quality Star Wars film since
Empire Strikes Back these statements were placed next to each other and
because they were said back to back it makes it seem like they go hand-in-hand
but they do not relate to each other in any way
consequentially his video is rather confusing as you constantly need to
assess whether his statements relate to his opinion
oh why does that keep reappearing I hate that argument it's not even an argument
opinion or objective references in the film this is why it's always best to
clearly separate the objective from the subjective in regards to film criticism
it makes conversations both clear and constructive in spite of the concept of
objectivity being rather obvious in regards to its existence
there are still some people who cling to the idea that art is subjective and
that there is no way to quantify or prove that something is poorly made but
all you need to do is take a look at a well-made film and a poorly made film to
come to a definitive conclusion on the existence of objective quality
The Dark Knight and Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice are two films which many
viewers have differing opinions towards most critics and audiences alike
agree that The Dark Knight is a good film and Dawn of Justice is a bad film
those who subscribe to the idea that film criticism is subjective will say
that this is based entirely on experience and the only reason that this
divide and opinion exists is that a lot of people like The Dark Knight and a lot
of people dislike Dawn of Justice
art success or failure is determined on an individual basis purely by the
experiences and the biases and the values of each observer a certain point of view
and this is the part of the argument where i frankly become confused
when you watch a film you have an emotional reaction to what you see on
screen but in order to have an emotional reaction you need to have something to
react to therefore everything in films comes down to references based on what
you see on screen those references are inherently
objective since they are based on what is provably on screen
whether you make a subjective or objective assessment it's all a matter
of the information you process when you watch a film
the subjective part comes down to the level that certain elements of a film
affect your enjoyment of it but it doesn't change what is provably in the
film the reason i chose The Dark Knight and Dawn of Justice as examples is
because the two films have several similarities
they both feature the character of batman feature an antagonist who seeks to
spread chaos throughout a city there are certain political and law
enforcement characters who play a significant role in the story
and both films are about complex themes of morality and how far people will go
to enforce justice however both films in regards to execution
couldn't be more different if there was a single different objective
element found in both films which illustrates the difference between them
it would be character motivation The Dark Knight centralizes around Batman
who has managed to cripple organized crime in the city of Gotham
he has done so through working closely with Jim Gordon and being strategic with
how he attempts to dismantle the mob his motivation established from the
beginning of the film is to maintain order in Gotham
this is what drives all three of the main protagonists the Joker on the other
hand is motivated to spread chaos throughout Gotham
he is someone who claims to be an agent of chaos and simply does things
because he enjoys them
upset the established order and everything becomes chaos
i'm gonna pause because i feel like i'm gonna get struck any second now
i really it sucks that we can't just play this like because you know it's all
in favor of criticism analysis and stuff that falls directly under fair use but
them bots can't tell the difference unfortunately
i'm an agent of chaos the conflict between batman and the joker is driven
by the fact the joker attacks batman's weaknesses
early in the film bruce states that the batman has no limits
know your limits master wane batman has no limits but later in the film after
the joker continues to kill innocent people and spread fear throughout
gotham batman realizes his boundaries and loses
someone he cares about the moment of triumph for the protagonist comes when
the joker fails to force two groups of innocent people to kill each other
hope wins over fear because the people of gotham proved to the joker that they
believe in good dent into his own agent of chaos
you didn't think i'd risk losing the battle for gotham's soul
in a fistfight with you you need an ace in the hole
mine's harvey leading to a climax where batman chooses to sacrifice his
reputation in the site of the civilians of gotham
in order to maintain order in gotham city the joker and batman are motivated
by the same goal but have different approaches to achieving their goal one
wishes to fight for gotham through order and the other wishes to corrupt gotham
with chaos these motivations for both the antagonist
and protagonist of the story are both clear
and concise batman v superman dawn of justice on the other hand has immensely
confusing motivations for characters which are based on contrived
information i just say as well wonderful uh production values on this
video for a youtube video yeah it's doing a great job everything's nice
and clean and clear the arguments are concise and
straightforward the editing is nice and relevant
and uh even the music he's matching it to the subjects
she's like oh i like you just so you know my kids are home so you might hear
some shadowings in the background um but they shouldn't be too loud yet i'm
still waiting for him to describe why um stating that all art is
objective all art is subjective can be damaging to art because that's
an important thing to talk about so i'm waiting for it but it's not not happened
yet so maybe that's something gordon is talking about
in the plans of the villain who succeeds mainly through luck
and seemingly predicting the future batman is introduced seeing the
destruction of metropolis at the end of man of steel
the destruction that he sees suggests that he may be concerned about superman's
presence on earth later when the audience is introduced to
him in costume he is fighting against human traffickers
crime fighting seems to be his new motivation with superman now being an
afterthought but later it is revealed that all along he
was attempting to get his hands on kryptonite to kill superman because he
doesn't want to take chances and because the flash told him that
superman was evil
that story line play out i love that uh i just it's just such a like
what did you expect bruce wayne to do with that information
lois laine is the key okay oh if i kill lois that'll stop
superman and gotcha oh that movie what the f*** mixed in with batman's
motivation is an immensely confusing story regarding superman
at the beginning of the film superman rescues lois laine from a terrorist group
but due to lex luther's henchman civilians are killed and superman is
blamed for their deaths this leads to heavily bizarre political
simultaneously superman learns about the criminals who have the brand of the bat
who are being killed in prison with only two scenes establishing that
superman has read about the prisoners and for seemingly no other reason
he confronts batman and threatens to kill him if he continues working as a
vigilante next time they shine your light in the sky
don't go to it the bat is dead bury it consider this mercy
i'm sorry have we met before after the bombing in dc where superman is somehow
blamed by the public batman prepares to fight superman
simultaneously lex somehow incorporates batman's independent plans into his
plans and kidnaps lois laine and martha kent in
order to force superman and batman to fight
these key events in the film are all incredibly contrived and not supported
by logical progression because this key moments such as the
titular fight scene are frustrating to watch
since they are based on flimsy motivation for the characters
this is objectively poor writing for the lead characters in a film
what i have just done is make an objective assessment about two separate
someone could come along and say that they enjoy don of justice just as much as
the dark knight there could be many reasons for this
perhaps said person really loves the character of batman or perhaps they are
an action junkie and simply appreciate car chases and fight scenes
or perhaps that person enjoys themes of morality and justice regardless of the
consistency of the plot if said person were to claim that they
liked both films equally this would be a subjective argument
but if they instead insisted that don of justice is as well made of the film as
the dark knight this would be an objective argument
and through scrutiny and analysis you would eventually come to a conclusion
that the dark knight is a well-made film and don of justice is a poorly made
film when it comes to objectivity and
subjectivity the ultimate example that i use is the godfather in the room
if there is no such thing as objectivity then these two films are on the same
playing field most people however will realize that
there is at least something which differentiates these films from each
other but believe it or not there are some who are attached the idea of
subjectivity to such an immense degree that they unironically believe that the
room is not objectively bad jack saint made this exact argument in
his video on objectivity what jack uses to reconcile a lack of
objectivity in art is by arguing that different audiences use different lenses
in order to form an assessment therefore if you watch the room with a
dramatic lens you will be immensely disappointed
but if you watch it with a comedic lens you will enjoy it
the room is not what is what is going on with this video look at that
looks terrible yeah lighting issues definitely
an objectively bad film if we discard authorial intent
it's to the audience to decide what the film really
is is it a drama that failed tremendously
or a comedy that fails tremendously how do you fail
there's no why even bother right like what
it's like it's just like well that this is the extreme
you know result of such an opinion and so at least is trying to be consistent
because the extreme result is to say that yeah the room
good movie because it's uh uh subjectivity you know
but it's just precedent things where you're like well
you can't nothing can fail you can't that's the thing
failure success these things are based on criteria
and nothing can fail if you don't believe if there's nothing objective
about it then it's not possible for it to fail
limited ways these filmmaking qualities the
acting the writing the editing either contribute to
or contradict a standard you individually must set this argument
does not prove that the room is not objectively poorly made it
simply means that if you watch a film in a certain way your subjective
experience of the film may be affected this is why many fans of the room tend
to watch the film in a theater it's so that they can enjoy every bit
of riffing and spoon throwing which makes the film more enjoyable
but no matter how you choose to view the film it is objective that the room
has horrendous character work editing and story structure
for a counter example let's say the Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds
upset several of its viewers who hated it for featuring Nazis
this would be an objective reference which the viewer would have used to form
their subjective assessment however Nazis fit naturally into the plot
of the film and the fact that there are Nazis in the film is not an objective
flaw as it matches the time period the film is set in
the person who disliked the film for having Nazis in it could choose to watch
the film with an anti-nazi lens which in this case would entail that
every time the viewer sees a Nazi in the film they pretend that they aren't
Nazis this could make said viewer enjoying
Inglourious Basterds more but this does not have any influence on
the quality of the film or change what is provably in the film
no matter how Nazis make you feel and no matter how you choose to view the film
it is provable that Nazis are in the film Inglourious Basterds
the arguments for both objectivity and subjectivity have been going on for
quite some time now no matter what people take away from a
film what everyone can agree on is that in order to assess a film
you need to reference elements which are definitively in the film
if you make an assessment of a character a setting a plot
a world or a film as a whole you're going to draw elements from the text
and your assessment of the film is dependent on how accurate your references
are this is why objectivity irrefutably exists
if it didn't then you wouldn't need references to make your assessment
you could argue for a scene or a character which wasn't featured in the
film but this isn't how assessments of films work
if you make a statement about a work of art which has an objective reference
it is an objective flaw or merit but if you make up a detail
argue from emotion or ignore details in the text to strengthen your argument
this makes your assessment of the text subjective since it is not based on
accurate references subjectivity is what makes art art
it's why we have different emotional responses to films
books
did somebody pause no i didn't know
paintings video games and so but while everyone has their own experience
sorry i paused it there but i forgot i was muted oh
oh no sorry i said it was a very interesting statement that he made then
he said subjectivity is what makes art art
and i'm not sure about that what's what's your view what makes art
my issue is categorically how does how does one define art
all right well rags you're generally the um
the one who looks up the definitions what does what's the definition of art
in the good old i will look up the definition because
i think it is extremely broad and for one of the most specific definition
for art and i'm interested if the official dictionary
conforms to well the the dictionary here
just the google one that pops up the expression or application of human
creative skill and imagination typically in a visual form such as
painting or sculpture producing works to be appreciated primarily for their
beauty or emotional power oh that's actually
very almost exact tool how i define it my
definition was a little bit more simplistic where
uh art i would define art as a form of expression
to cause an emotional reaction of some type
usually a positive emotional reaction but i think i like the official one a
bit better where um a separate or in addition to the
emotional reaction what was it it was to uh to create something that was pleasing
to the eye was it uh to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or
primarily for their beauty so i i think i like that like art is something
that is made to be appreciated for their beauty or to cause an emotional reaction
and specifically a an expression of some type
usually visual but not always see under that objective standard
you can actually quantify i feel art on levels as to one being more valuable
than another and not just on a subjective i think you can actually
almost make it more objective i'm not too bothered by it myself i
feel the same way about genre discussions i'm less interested in the
broader parts of it more interested in the in the details so when someone says
like how do you blah blah blah blah art i'm
like can we be more specific talk about like a craft
and then we can get into that instead because uh
what's what is what defines a piece of art doesn't really bother me
um this is this is kind of my view here right if you can
objectively quantify artistic value you can then apply it more effectively
onto the quality of something to determine if it's good on
based on its artistic value and i think that's really important then
well i mean my position is that there's there's a hard this
there's a we're dealing with a very large amount of things that can come
under that qualification the staggering yeah yeah but but yeah
that but that doesn't mean that that's fine yeah a lot of things
come under the definition but individually you can
judge those things yeah like i said you can just things individually
to how well they achieve the artistic standard of what
of what art is and therefore more accurately figure out if it's good
art or not based on um uh how strong of an emotional
reaction it is capable of making and how
beautiful it is based on specific standards
would that be like um a pole of how everybody felt about the piece
from a zero to a ten well not even not even a pole a black like okay let's look
at some examples like for instance a painting that is like quite literally
three colored lines just vertical colored lines okay
and that is considered a work of art and then compare that to
the mona lisa all right um one conveys something of far more
complex beauty than another and so already it is of a much higher
standard under that form of judgment okay uh
another one is one it's a person and and people are able to convey emotion in
their facial expressions far more than three lines and so
one is also able to convey emotionality far better than another so
already i think you can quite objectively state that the mona lisa
is objectively a much superior form of art than the one with the three lines
what if someone said they actually got more emotional resonance from the three
lines than the mona lisa well then i think you will want to try
and compare it like yeah because this is the tricky one i
think you could say fairly confidently that mona lisa is far
better at evoking emotion in people than three
lines um i think that would be something you
could say that's quite truthful but i agree that it's true but that still
doesn't mean it's objective could you substantiate that objectively
that would be well here what what essentially if uh if
99.9 people who looked at the two images still
said that the mona lisa you know gave them more emotional
you know feedback essentially well they're still that's still their
opinion but it's an object statistic though once
you've recorded oh the statistic doesn't really
matter oh no statistics are important to determine
no not here not this one not for the sake of determining objectivity
no for the sake of determining artistic value popularity of a given
you know of an accepted or of an opinion sure yeah
it's an objective poll of what people's opinions are
their opinions are what make it yeah yeah yeah yeah but so i was gonna say
earlier um i think that by saying which is
better is kind of or which is of higher quality
is a little bit too we need to refine that a little bit more
and i think it would be one of those things where you say
um the mona lisa it's it's not enough if you want to be objective it's not
enough to say that the mona lisa is a higher quality work of art you would
have to say the mona lisa is a higher quality
picture of a person and the three lines are going to be a
objectively those three lines are a a higher quality picture of three lines
yeah yeah i think you could compare them more
like on a value you know thing like for instance
one fit quite you could say quite almost
definitively objectively one requires far more skill to make than the other
i agree i agree is of more value um and is a more
valuable uh piece of art as a result he was subjective though
yeah the problem is no no well look at all no you can sell like an artistic
toilet for a billion dollars i know i know i know and that's just depressing
like some of their prices are modern which is just garbage is unbelievable
and i think that's a complete just racket that's being played
on that side of things um and so maybe not value uh when i say
um quality quality yeah i would probably call it polity then
yeah i i think um quality generally when i
use it i i think ball is the same way uh correct me if i'm wrong but quality
refers to adherence to a standard yeah uh the degree to which a standard is
achieved would be it's quality well pretty much
just on the base of technical so just based off
technical skill to create certain impressive art forms
you can apply a an objective quality standard on artwork
yeah that's why um but like like the value part comes in it's almost i'd say
i would say it's almost universal to the point where especially in colloquial
conversation without getting too anal about
everything and too pedantic sometimes you have to but normally you
don't have to you can say that yeah yeah the
monolice is better than these three lines because of the way that we almost
universally assign value to the skill it takes to do those things
yeah uh great i was just gonna say if we let uh this video finish up i can do a
couple of um i'll talk about it a bit more just
i just want to let it finish this ranked in your argument this makes your
assessment of the text subjective since it is not based on
accurate references subjectivity is what makes art
art it's why we have different emotional responses to films
books paintings video games and so but while everyone has their own
experiences which affect their enjoyment of art
it does not mean that there are no standards which are used to assess
quality standards and objective references are what define the quality
of art your personal experience is important
but it only applies to you the way you can discuss art with others is by
arguing for merit and quality so when having conversations on art
separate the objective from the subjective and have conversations about
both but do not go the safe route to reconcile
poor filmmaking or writing by saying that art is entirely subjective
if you had a strong emotional reaction to a film that is excellent for you
just remember however that art isn't based on experience
it's based on standards and quality that is what makes art
objective on all sides of the argument there have been those putting forward
the idea that you are one way or another consuming media
wrong either those who find there to be no value
in evaluating purely objective elements of a text
or those who ultimately think it's the only thing that matters
and all those plot holes people complain about they don't actually matter
a few minutes later i know it seems impossible to watch movies wrong
but you're watching movies wrong you're so stupid
who was that that's patrick williams
oh these are the people who constantly unironically say the things
that the same group accuses us of saying and that it's bad that we say them
when we don't say oh wow yeah that's very interesting
our video was made by um evan monroe he is uh currently sitting at 145
subscribers and i think that's a little bit unfair considering uh
the quality of that video and i'm not just referring to the fact that i
agree with a lot of his arguments it's also just all the production elements
very strong um there were objective standards of
quality in that video i would have liked uh i think i agree with shad it would
have been cool for him to have uh it wouldn't take too long as well to just
explain one of the down the pitfalls of everything being
subjective what can happen if that's the case
um there's loads of real world references you can have for that we
we know a few arguments ourselves but he didn't use one and he doesn't
necessarily have to it just would have been neat to have uh
given a few of those examples but um yeah well just even towards the end like
and he basically did you know qualify what he said about when he said you
know art needs to be um i forget what it was but i question
but he went on to say about you know the quality and objective nature of art is
an important element of it um and so yeah he went on to on to say
that that was that was good um but as to how
treating art in a wholly subjective way damages art
that one wasn't fully uh you know gone into detail on
and just because because and the answer is simply this
art can be um judged on a level or scale of quality
according to objective standards and if you then treat it all as objective
the result is going to be far much more quantities of art that are much lower
in quality because you've actually tried to throw
you know the standards of quality out the window
and i and i would say that for for us of course but also all the people who
you know agree with objectivity and art um
not everything in art can be judged objectively
objectivity is not uh it's not something that you can use to measure
everything it's not a it's not really universal in that sense there's some
things that objectivity simply doesn't it doesn't deal with um there are
there are realms of things outside of objectivity
so it isn't a failure of objective criticism
because it can't uh be used to judge and analyze things that are subjective
so don't feel like if you're in a discussion with somebody
that you need to use objective measurement in order to
um to that you have to apply it to something where it's not appropriate
you know you wouldn't use geology to study you know
something in the realm of dendrochronology or something like that
it has its place and has its uses uh don't but basically don't get tricked
into applying it into things where it doesn't need to be applied
so yeah i actually tend to believe that technically everything is objective but
some are so conscious that it's hard that it's impossible to define uh in
exact terms like give me out for instance like
if i could understand a person's personality perfectly in every way
okay i could create a work of art based on their life like what i know would
trigger their emotion a bit more like if um for instance if it's a father who
loves being father that would kind of give me a certain
sight of you know an image of a father saving his children would
evoke strong emotions with this individual
and i could you know make a work of art that conforms to
very specific objective standards to that individual that would
result in him having a very strong emotional attachment and like for
something i make even if he couldn't break down exactly why
he's having such a strong emotional attachment to it and it would work really
well for people of that mindset it wouldn't work universally because
everyone's different but if you could understand everyone
individually you could cater things to a multitude of
objective standards it's just impossible to know what all
those many different standards are on an individual basis on them
you know macro scale well the issue there
is that it would still be his emotional reaction
which is going to be subjective all the way i actually feel emotional reactions
are objective but we don't necessarily know what
they all are because they're so you know
subconscious elements to it and stuff okay sorry yeah the feeling itself is
still it it is objective whether or not it exists
or not that's different than it is still something that is subjective
well see i feel there are always causes objective causes for people's emotional
reactions and even if they're hard to understand
and we might not know them if we could know them i think would
always find a reason for it yeah there can be a reason for something
that's still subjective you sure like explain is there a way to
there is there is a reason that my favorite color is blue for instance
right so if someone's favorite color is blue
right now there's a reason for it right having to do with genetics or anything
like that sure but it's still their preference
it's still what they prefer it isn't based off of
objective criteria well no however it's objective that it is
their favorite color yeah no but if you could break down the
everything to the most perfect understanding even on a psychological
level of the you know whatever chemicals going on in the brains to cause you to
like that color those are the objective standards that
do exist cause that result
it's a bit of the words of being so like how good this particular thing
is someone says well it's amazing because i like birds and there's birds
in it like that's a totally subjective reason
the next person is going to be completely different on that and the next
person is going to be completely different on that
when we say objective it's like something that doesn't get denied for
the next person like a reality whether or not there's birds in there
sure that's that's that's a thing but whether or not the birds being there
makes it a good thing what are you basing that on like that
that's just your personal preference and even if it's to the micro degree it'll
change with every single person then that just means that the read that
that just means there are objective reasons
for why something is subjective
so everything is objective i don't think so
some kind of entity that could detect every single operation in every single
way maybe that's all that's me that's actually
kind of how i look at it even to that extremely broad scale
like so you would say that everything is objective
there's no subjectivity doesn't exist no no i would say
everything can be viewed upon in a subjective way
but that never undermines the objective nature of what
or why things are or why they they do the things they do
are you talking in like a methodological naturalist kind of way
yeah more specific like you like in what instance
the one that you described about color like there are there are impulses in my
brain oh that's the thing i i don't know what
causes someone to like a certain color like if it is a chemical thing in the
brain or what there could be so many reasons to cause someone to
like a certain color over another color i have no idea what they are but i do
tend to believe that there are specific reasons that cause it
objective well the the there could be a difference between the the
reason could be objective but it can produce
a subjective result
when you say subjective results what do you mean by that is in a result
the only reason that it it's it is our preference
even if it even even if that comes through in a measurable way
that doesn't mean that it's not at the end of the day still just
are subjective no i wouldn't call it like if there are specific reasons to
cause it that means if another person has
conforms to those exact same standards the result
wouldn't be that they like a different color those standards are whatever
causes them to like the color okay they become the standards that cause
people to like the color and if you duplicate those standards
whatever they are if it's a chemical thing in the brain or whatever
in another person that would achieve the same result
and therefore it would be an objective result not a subjective result
no because subjective is based on or influenced by personal feelings tastes
or opinions
that's the definition yeah but we've read but like again i and i think we're
coming down to just maybe what we're defining a bit differently
because their person's tastes preferences and even opinions in my mind
all ultimately have objective causes even if we don't know they are and can't
define them if you don't know what they are can you be confident in saying that
they are objective causes i would say i can be confident in it
because that is how we see generally how nature works
overall like um when you know cause and effects
something causes something else okay um and so i have not been given any reason
to not believe that to this point i'm not saying it could be wrong
but just by general understanding of nature there this is just the way i kind
of view you know the world is that that's why i almost
fall into a viewpoint of everything has a reason
cause and it's all right so so how could anything be subjective
because people can have opinions on things that aren't correct so everything
can be viewed subjectively but that doesn't change
the objective nature of those things or how they came to be
so people can have subjective opinions how is the arrival of those subjective
opinions different than the arrival on favorite color
okay for instance say um someone has an opinion
that the moon is made of cheese that's subjective because the moon is not made
of cheese okay um but the things that cause them to
reach that opinion okay whatever chemical the way they
process or anything would be things that you could quantify
objectively is my view so how is that different from the color
one it's not but the differences is i'm sorry
the differences is one core objective things or objective
stance that cause one result is an opinion that's accurate and
another cause an opinion that's inaccurate and if it's inaccurate
the machines is not accurate but those are still both subjective
the opinion the opinions are you can still be subjective it can be inaccurate
like in terms of it's true that that's their opinion
but how they got to their opinion is like
if you have is this going to be about objectivity coming down to because
there are specific reasons on like a biological level why people
have these opinions is that what makes them
objective i don't know i'm trying to understand exactly just i'll give an
attempt at reframing so like when you when you make a claim that's subjective
it's typically going to because it's subject to you
versus something that is subject to the existence of something outside of the
object that we're currently discussing that's irrelevant of you
like the so this is just a matter of which specific
example we use right all right so so favorite color is
subjective or not subjective
okay see i would generally say i mean the fact well just the fact that you say
to you is subjective well it's objective that it's the case but it's still it is
a subject i'm happy to say that but um the choice the the value system
that's going to be applied is going to be entirely based on
what you prefer and i know it's funny me saying
this because that's what they say about the whole our our systems for
objective but like it just gets thrown out the window when there's plenty of
films we all the things we like that we consider
to be objectively failing and they're failing based on standards
that are like intrinsic to storytelling or whatever current craft we're looking
at um that's that's so we're saying that i
enjoyed this so if someone says i excuse me if
someone says i enjoy this film then it is based then is that subjective
because it fits in perfectly with their personal
standards for whether or not that film is good or not
or whether or not they enjoyed it depends on how they qualify i guess
if they want to well um if the standard if someone watches a movie
regardless of its quality and they say i like that movie
then that criteria is that they're using is did this film
you know did did i enjoy this film and if yes i did
then it conforms to the criteria which makes it objective which would be
subjective right so can anything be subjective if we use that as a
measurement
wait can any objective well no it was like i'm asking it's
objective to their standard that that the standard is simply did they
like it or not right and i guess what you're saying is they came out they felt
good and they were like therefore i like this film
right so it so is this is is the confusion here
that we're using i i i think it does come down to the whole
it is objectively true that they did enjoy it
but that enjoyment is subjective though they're the only ones that can really
make that statement right because we can't
they could be lying they could we don't we don't have the sufficient
information to prove that beyond their their word right
yeah that this is the same thing as the the color thing i use right thank
so yeah that so i just i i guess i was just a matter of rewarding
when i was saying i suppose unless there's still confusion
i mean it's just a very interesting argument oh well and that's the thing
what we're talking about is uh people are going to talk about this for
centuries after we're gone uh i love it because i i i believe in
objective truth and i love you know objective truth in general and stuff and
so like the moon is a
satellite orbiting the earth okay that uh that's the that's an objective
statement okay and from everything we've been out of
the curve and uh you know test of it this is true
not to say well discover something that undermines that
before you go let just i'll squeeze something in there really quick um it
actually popped up earlier but i was distracted by something
um uh don't uh the objectivity subjectivity thing um
i wouldn't get too hung up on the idea of like absolute truth
uh it's it's got its own philosophical issues and it's not even
really all that relevant anyway it's because everything that we
accept and believe and can quote unquote prove is all tentative based on
information that we have so you can assess things objectively
and still get it wrong yeah but you can still make objective
assessments so always something important to remember so
even if you are talking about a film for instance
even if you're talking about a film and you make an
objective qualification on a scene that happens or something some
aspect about the film and i think it's wiser to talk about
individual aspects instead of the thing as a whole
but if you talk about um an individual aspect of a film
um then you can you can use objectivity to make that assessment
and it might it might not be correct it might not be true
in some way but you can still use objectivity to assess its quality
um you just remember that it's always tentative
just so we don't get too far away from it i was just gonna say it's at the top
of the description now a link to that video and
it's being spammed in chat by me right now
go subscribe and check out i'm not sure if he actually has other videos that's
a question um but it's just uh it's just cool
because like there's barely any videos like that
wouldn't you describe that video as relatively bold
uh sure yeah a lot of people would have issues with it
a lot of people would be really upset at the idea that
oh you can't i mean we say in like a meme way that the room is
terrible but then you actually look at it and you assess it and you
use reference here's the thing i like that about his video he says
we use references we take the things that we saw
we all saw right stuff that we can independently verify
exists with one another you know thing basically using
in a very casual form of the scientific method to say okay
we we can all agree that these references exist these scenes exist
and therefore we can all use those as a baseline as our as our sources
essentially as a resources in order to make measurements and use
objective you know or analyze it objectively
the use of resources i think i think it's good rhetoric you know
it's a good word to use because people yeah that would get a lot of people to
think oh yes resources that's something that i use when i
write a paper for school or when i'm uh looking up for some piece of information
i we use references we find other things and we use those to
you know to to talk to other people and point to those and say this is where
this information comes from
i agree all right then um oh and also
before we go i'm sorry just just because because it's on my mind
um do not allow people to delve things into the realms of
philosophical absurdity so we're talking about hard solipsism
and things along that nature i said it in a meanie way
but the whole how do you know that reason is reasonable
there's some things that we have to just take
if we're gonna have a discussion and exist together and
that's when you get to use philosophical raises to
get to uh yeah the conclusion yeah i got old axioms right
yeah pretty much yeah so don't if you have to
devolve into the point of absurdity about something and you can't make any
references for it then just say you know we're just gonna
have to pragmatically move past that to have a discussion at all
axiom is a cool word
it sounds cool all right i find it interesting how the
whole subjectivity mod mob can try and argue against it because their whole
the whole philosophical underpinning kind of logic
is flawed because you could only state you know
everything is subjective is an objective statement that you could only try and
substantiate improve with objective references and so it's
all flawed from the very beginning and like going to the room right
where that guy was saying the room is a good movie i find that really interesting
because stating it's a good movie is based on an
objective standard that it is a good bad movie
which means you can only have that standard by having a standard that
determines what is a good movie and what is a bad movie from the very beginning
to then be able to determine that it's a good bad movie and so it's just very
interesting contradictory yeah and and someone in chat asks
compare to every movie you've seen or every movie ever made
um i guess it depends on specifics but as i said before you could
objectively analyze things and be wrong as long as you're taking references and
using them and you're not relying on feelings and
stuff that's certainly a step in the right direction
and as long as you yeah before we had a lot of science it was a
pretty objective observation that the earth was flat because
just by general observation that's the first conclusion most people come to
it's just when you test things further you realize oh
okay it's not flat but yeah depending on the
standards you have to begin with and the information available
yeah you can absolutely reach incorrect conclusions
by following an objective you know uh way of thinking
just you don't just all of your all of your findings are
but you use objectivity to get closer and closer to the truth
sometimes you can nail it down basically probably as much as you possibly can
especially when you have a very set especially with films you have a
set amount of resources to pull from and there's just there's
it doesn't go on forever there's a very finite amount of stuff to pull from
so a lot of times you could really bang it you know
uh which there we go pretty much pushes me into the whole like
should we begin the super chats which are um
there's a few uh because there's a whole bunch from last time
that we didn't quite get to and then this but
i do need to finish this up before it it gets too late give me about 10 minutes
and then i'll go for it i'll i'll keep any of the referred directly to you
all right i got you uh i will be uh right back
very well um shad what would you like to do now
uh you're obviously sticking around for now all right
let's do some of the super chats well so this is the
the thing the one i'm going to read them they're essentially in order
and so these are the ones from last time um but obviously you're welcome to
jump in whenever you want and uh it'll take me a while to get through these
you're welcome to leave whatever you want but any of the ones that are direct
to you i will keep like uh we had the bunch at the beginning of the stream
awesome um i'm gonna start with the stream labs once if i can just get the
right date
all right this is a whole bunch i've got so many to read best get started
anos i solved 50 of crime what did it cost
only 13 i get it very clever using marvel references now huh molar have
you seen chef i have no idea what that is
chef with two f's does that sound familiar at all
i don't know it hmm sounds like a netflix special i mean
yeah it could be
so episode nine twist a dark figure appears from the ether and defeats palpatine
with such ease that it demoralizes ray and crew due to the unspeakable
power of the shrouded and mysterious individual
the being looks upon ray its long eye stalks extended far beyond the realm of
shadow blinking one yellow slitted eye at a time the creature
from the gloom speaks in a voice not of this world one so shrill and deafening
it causes our valiant heroes to fall to their knees in anguish
you're gonna have a bad time you're gonna bow to me sir
ray fighting to cling to his sanity cries out at her foe
who what are you the creature begins to emit a tittery laugh
mesa the true dark lord mesa have many names
but you may call me a long pause fills the entirety of the room
every second that passes fills our crew with so much
despair that their very sanity begins to teeter on the knife's edge
it feels as if the universe itself has come to sudden to a sudden halt
but as suddenly as the creature came it then vanishes as the robed figure steps
from the shadows arms wide with a wicked yellow toothy
filled grin painted from ear to floppy droopy ear
mesa da darth insanius insadius i guess end credit all right
i mean i i'd go for that at this point considering the leaks episode dies
because i'm seeing a disaster so oh yeah i've been watching um uh the efap
where you go through the uh a leaked plot
i mean if i like spoilers just because i want to comment on one of the things
if the if the force ghosts appear towards the end
to fight for them ah i'll just lose like i'll be enraged i won't be laughing i'll
be like this is where it's come to like holy
rock if i could you get anything that is more deus ex machina than that
like a literal god ghost thing appearing out of nowhere to save the
era like
who needs ryan stan does this all subjective
um anyway post-credit scene darth insanias
goes bla bla with his tongue and vores ray oh my goodness
horrifying what would lord the rings be like if you just replaced gandalf with
hitler same powers and everything just now you have hitler i'd like to think
you'd just go around calling saron and saruman
untermensch
i mean i would watch the potential version pretty sure if he was in that
world he would be a very different character because of different
upbringing and different different environmental
effects you know that's how it would work maybe he would really like hobbits
and hate elves or vice versa yeah yeah i was gonna say probably he hates
hobbits but you know he didn't like the abnormal people i don't know what he was
saying
um
jay longbone needs to be decolonized when she's using the n-word she's
literally denying the humanity of her black allies and she's committing
imperialism against the black experience on behalf of the white patriarchy of
objective media criticism i'm sure she would agree
hello all my jay longbone words love you wolf wags you're a waskily wagger muffin
i'm sure you'd be happy to hear that good luck dealing with the motion
picture robertson let the lengthening continue
why thank you plays kylo's theme kylo gets launched off a platform and falls
to his death plays ra theme yeah do you know about that kylo's
oh yeah that kylo just gets dumped down a hole and buys supposedly
all right then yeah there we go all that surviving he did
in the end of force awakens and the the lightsaber explosion and tlj
why will that just be thrown down a hole there was so many
missed opportunities like it's unbelievable kylo could have been
a fairly interesting villain i mean oh it's just and yeah there's a it's all a
miss this is for jamie hey king you drop this
better hurry the theater is 50 meters away and you only have one
one three minutes until jo wait so this is a message for
a friend of yours called jamie or is this a reference to something that i'm
missing better hurry the theater's 50 minutes
away and you only have one 13 minutes until joker starts
was i the stream for that super chat or was that no no that was the previous
stream okay so wasn't for me maul i can't remember his school years
clearly an alien push the button vader or voodoo yes that's a
another strong reference um any chance anna could join you guys for
the batwoman finale if have reactions and her reviews are my
favorite part of the week uh we've had a lot of requests to have
jay long gone on for uh like the finale or whatever the
thing with um the format as it stands it's really hard
to um edit with clarity when you have four
people live reacting to a tv show um because you'll have certain scenes
where two people at once want to complain about two different things at
once and then while the scene continues there's more problems that someone else
notices while the two people are fighting over to speak
and so you end up that's why we've been pausing more lately i think is because
we're starting to realize that and just if you add another person all it
really means probably is that someone else is just going to have to talk as
much and um so let's say it's a maybe and um i
mean her reviews are fantastic she's not like she needs to be on
i watched a couple of jay long bones reactions to um
to bat bat woman and oh yes yep yeah she's pretty good um
also rag has been getting that monthly thrust for a while now
he's not gotten a single monthly thrust not got a single one
and uh hopefully tonald will provide it once he's back on his patreon i guess i
don't know when that may be obligatory you guys are still going
seriously though appreciate you so much may your lengthen evermore
may you lengthen evermore there you go um the frequency of these faps has left
me scarred and deformed well uh there's only one extra one this
this recently it feels like there's a lot at once though
the lesson southpaw recently gave jeremy from geeks and gamers some fair
criticism on reddit and youtube but he forgot a
he forgot about the worst offense which is the fumes of toxic toxic
masculinity wow i can't speak today masculinity
emitting from jeremy and his heteronormative car videos
um they actually had a discussion uh a few hours before this efap started
on southpaw's channel you can check it out if you're interested
um sincere thoughts on the detriment to the plot of the eagles and lord of rings
movies has elrond and gandalf used some throwaway line while discussing their
options for destroying the ring that'd have been great nazgul isn't a good
enough answer uh that was actually my stance with
wolf when we first discussed it i think in one of the earlier efaps i just said
that i think it would have been much stronger to just have a line
there's a lot of inference you need to do um
which isn't necessarily bad it's just that um
there's to a degree i think it's a risk is what we establish and we have to
assume that the characters think it's too much of a risk
and i'm like i don't know i don't know maybe it'll be worth it get a huge crowd
of eagles have the important one in the center
just freaking go for it bolts right to the volcano
and or if they like did the flight in small little steps like they fly to one
mountaintop and just you know anyone see me where i think they're safe
fly to the next mountaintop yeah they might have been able to get there and
that's why if we could have like um a character explicitly be like it's way
too risky to do something like that i'd be like okay
just just to reaffirm that that is definitely they're aware of it and they're
very much against it you know as risky as going through the minds of
moria as risky as setting sab and Frodo up a
staircase into she loves layered through kirithog
gulls like risky risky um it is a shame for a man to grow old
without seeing the beauty and strength of the movie sahara 2005 starring matthew
mcconaughey the plot seems very tight to me i've
seen that film but i haven't seen it in ages same i can't remember anything
about it but they don't they'd like to old ship into
i don't know sailing on sand or something am i getting things really
maybe meet a long time um but my cream has never been stronger
these are all these all these palpatine references not against it howdy mauler
and high raggers maybe we should pet her maybe we should
petaly avenge literally by deciding to use figuratively
instead hey we can't save one why not kill both
i was to start using figuratively when we mean literally just to screw
everything up we could do it let's kill the dictionary
guys um i found out through the uk government
memorial program last year that two men with my exact name and two other men
with my father's exact name were all killed in welsh guard units
during world war one and four with granddads also since
i'm welsh and i didn't know oh welcome to the tribe
i've just learned about a black debate professor in utah who argued to a
stunned white student that space and paris france
don't exist because he hasn't been there and went on to say that black
astronauts can't be trusted fuck this gay earth um
okay interesting takes from that guy he's a professor
wow okay um response far from home and homecoming i think the vulture was a
much more believable villain the mysterious
what was the latter's plan if after he succeeded an avenger's level threat then
showed up does he just not consider that well he can still um do some damage
like he's not that far away from like the first iron man suit in that he has
access to missiles bullets sound waves shock waves and illusions
can actually do some damage to enemies in terms of tricking them
um so i think he's he's still got a pretty impressive arsenal whether or not
he's uh able to do the things we we seem to see him do if that makes sense
but you know like if you think about it um black widow is
you know considered good enough to be an avenger so he can still do some stuff
but he's not it's not gonna look as it'll be weird i don't know how it
would be difficult to account for it because you'd be like why aren't you
doing your blasts of green smoke at them why aren't they doing that much and
if you were the creature he's doing it to
you'd be able to see inside of it and be like what is all this shit there's a
bunch of droids or whatever like this is weird so yeah there's a lot of variables
but um he could still do some damage
and um i'm back that is hello taking care of
haven't had one that is specifically directed yet so you're right
all right hey finally managed to catch you live have you ever heard or played
the star wars old republic game i it's an mmo the last thing that is not
infected with the new canon it's eight different class stories
and first two expansions are completely free
i have not played it i didn't get very far in it i passed the tutorials on
several classes and then got to like the second or third planet
before i started to get mmo fatigue because of
but it was the in terms of the story in many of the quests that was actually
pretty cool i heard i had good stories here
oh yeah someone called you waskily wags i shouldn't forget that
oh okay uh now we're on super chats from uh
last stream i just did all the stream lives ones now we're onto these ones
uh hello is that the star wars one the way you broke down the star wars plot
no that's the joker one that isn't released yet it will be where we covered
movie bob and uh nando versus movies okay
um hello my jeb webs where the jeb words i wouldn't wish a movie
blob video on my worst enemy also high rags hello strong cast for
this fat boy's jeb approves yes he would yeah it was a good one
uh my subjective opinion but covering movie bob's bad takes
is the only things is the only things efap one of my favorite podcasts
becomes more boring than when they do efap debate episodes
it is more less choice to cover stuff but damn
uh actually uh movie bog is heavily requested
uh whenever he puts a video out i get several links
people like oh my god have you already said this one
he's one of the ones that have been more vocally against joker so it just seemed
to be suitable and um i think we got a decent
chunk of of efap out of it like i i dare i say
entertainment versus informa informative you know
entertainment of a kind yeah um but no it is tough
dealing with movie bob and that's fair um and obviously if you don't like it
when there's debates or movie book coverage i you know
that's totally on you it's up to you yeah
i agree he's retarded but not funny returned
i see that must be about movie bob welcome back wolf missed you smiley
face wolf would say thank you he would um this is scoby jew instead
of scooby jew and the and frank chronicles i mean oh my i don't know they
did that scooby doo episode but they maybe uh this is a bad time to join the
stream poor bibs what did we do to some birds
what did anyone do to some birds birds yeah this is gonna be tough because
we're delving really far back into lots of conversation
looking forward to watching this efap when i catch up i'm about 30 episodes
behind good to see mauler wolf and rags all here
well joe somebody you'll be curious to see when you finally listen to
be saying this if you do um you all just left me that i've been in a
serious relationship for a while so i'm stuck here alone angry and feeling like
my heart has been ripped out and crushed all that and i still have to listen to
fucking movie bob thanks you massive so cheers you massive
do not worry um it's not the best thing to have to listen to movie bob after
an experience like that but i mean he was defeated he only killed
mostly everybody it's fine um but yeah you know sorry to hear it and
hopefully you got some some uplifting entertainment out of it to a degree
did bob just blame shooters on single mums oh no
oh no yeah that was a weird part of his video
like the highlighting that this the the mother was the cause of all the
problems that he's like it's like dude
uh what's this a midweek efap truly you spoil us also go watch jojo rabbit i'm
not going to stop mentioning it until you do
i mean i want to see it i'm not against it i would like to see it yeah
uh mauler no not another efap my wallet can only support so many super chats how
will i eat how will i pay rent clearly this is your fault
i am so sorry just look after yourself make sure
you'll be fine um what's the best vision of scooby-doo in your opinion my
favorite is the pup named scooby
i don't really what's the best yeah i mean i just watched the tv show when i
was younger and i liked it a lot oh yeah i hated a pup named scooby-doo
i don't think i saw any of the scooby-doos i always felt scooby-dooing
yeah they're fine i like scooby-doo on zombie island
yes the witches ghost i like some of the movies they're pretty good
yeah well i mean i remember like in the show that the movie sort of evolved from
um but like i didn't care that much for the um the live action movies i was like
oh nah they were goofy um the super chat simply says i nutted
wonderful you know bob stein better cease this tom
foolery immediately otherwise i'ma turn his pen is into a pen was
oh that's a terrifying threat right there um lind mauler has a kiwi farms
thread most of them are supportive but actually have good critiques of your
style i'd suggest a read through what is kiwi farms exactly i've never
heard of that some forum on the internet in that forum
all right um fair enough movie blob can fuck himself
because no one else will
we had a lot of vitriol for movie bob clearly
yeah he's a spiteful nasty person it's hard to listen to his video honestly
bob is just projecting probably killed his bob oh my goodness
oh my goodness go anna go tear his ass apart
oh she did she definitely should some perspectives save for jay long ago
the um movie bob has this thing it's just it's bizarre
not many people like his stuff when they they told a comment on it or at least
invite it to um i don't know what that's that's about
you know it's weird you should just interesting pattern
well the only uh thing i've ever been out of watch for movie bob is stuff
that you review on efap and i don't agree with many of his
takes wow and he speaks so fast like
makes him smarter yeah like i i don't know him personally might be a nice guy
to get along with but his video content yeah just from what
i've been able to see uh you know and it's only a little amount
but it seems like he speaks fast and then he tries to fill up what he's
saying with a lot of fluff and not much substance and then when
it does say something um substantive it's generally incorrect so
that's a winner yeah no he's very unimpressive and um
downright one of the forest content creators there is in terms of just like
analysis content but hey oh yeah after william said he was great
right or he said he was a he was the only traditional reviewer
i don't know what that means but hey that's that's true that's the case
oh that's a quite the condemnation of traditional reviewers
yeah i know i don't know what they did sabbatric but okay
it is um wolf do not look up bayowin's deviantart
all right wolf don't do that according to the secret
don't do it um what's the meaning or law behind you
massive you can actually this is a good segue for a little plug
you go to the effap.me website it actually has
uh where is it origins as a tab you click that
then via the alphabetical ordering you can go to m
for massive and then you can look at the origin of massive
it even has a link to the conversation i think that
that originates it and the episode obviously
so um not bad pretty pretty neat is a thing so i recommend you go do that and
it's it's just in the link in the description a very
nice and clean way for it to be delivered um even if movie blob were to
be roofed he would only bounce we need something
more powerful to end him we need to force him to walk
upstairs i don't know you could so he dies of suffocation or something
i think that's the idea he just can't possibly oxygenate his body fast enough
it's gonna it's the problem is getting him to go up the stairs how do we do
that also put some diabeto float
diabeto
hmm i don't know i mean by command of the sugar around him he could sort of do
like magneto does i think it's mostly it's not so much the superpower
probably as much as he's just a big fat guy
oh i mean he's diabeto regs
yeah but can you command sugar at your will you ain't you no no no you're not
no you aren't a fat guy no no no i'm getting there i'm working
towards it max right why are you trying to don't take it
away from him he's trying to earn this i can't take it away from him if you
never had it
uh the joker a misogynist serial killer whose victims are a whopping 8.3 women
yeah well that's the conclusion someone coming to you
oh and hi regs hey hello i've only interacted with the film
furor once he told me disney didn't kill off luke or han because you can still
buy luke and han merch and the ot yeah that's how that works
yeah all right okay um lest i forget to thank the memers from last efap i really
i did appreciate the squid billy drawing showing me stuffing the guy into a funko
funko pop a box like i said in super chats love the egyptian rah
with the armband rah's liking the art guys good stuff
uh why am i i think the armband that i had it did seem kind of like it was like
it i was thinking it was like an eagle or something
so i don't know i just didn't know for certain
oh yeah he's talking about um a picture for himself like one of the
raw ones as because this is obviously from the previous uh oh right right right
why are so many people struggling with the simple and downright basic messages
and ideas from this film why is it so hard to grasp for them
because it's not complicated enough gotta gotta be more complex than that
i don't even sure what i'm actually advocating for at that point in terms of
having them understand it i think it's too
maybe they just don't like the idea of advocating to be
kind to your fellow man i don't know it's like it's gotta be more
nuanced um but i mean it's still fascinating maybe they don't want to say
there's nothing more to it maybe maybe they're
i don't know i i don't even think i could say it's just like another
state of mind i'm just not familiar with
you brave souls i'm so sorry i had to suffer through any of bob's videos
yeah we've done is it three or four now i think it's three
three one of those three yeah one in the 50th one when we first covered
him and one recently it's not like that
um despite representing just 13 percent of creators on the escapist movie blob
represents 50 percent of all body mass oh that's
that's it not bad no
rags where's your modern warfare 3 and gears of war 5 review
i checked exclusively games but they weren't there
hmm not sure i'll give a i'll give a note to him
see how uh see what's going on also wolf you sound stressed halo for in the
prequels and nickelback will help with that also hi mola hello
well we're saying hi my editor oz just misses me to say hi rags he says hi
oh hello how kind you're right you're you're who
my editor is a good mate your editor oh is he like there with you
uh no just he messaged me over steam but uh i got you
we've actually launched a kunan exile server that we run
jointly together so it's not any good oh yeah i like what i like yeah might not
be for everyone but yeah i think it's great why are you
attacking him rags oh i mean i like i like stop it
if you think raw throws me why i have my opinions gosh
and he's a bad you're evil if you think raw throws movie bob into the pit of
broccoli he'll have to eat his way out and come out normal
oh is that he's asking if you think if that would happen
wouldn't he just die instead of eating his way out i don't know
besides well maybe his will to maybe his will to eat
would be stronger than his will to eat you know certain things in particular
you know like if he absolutely had to eat healthy maybe he he would if you
took away all the choice yeah i mean it's a survival thing i don't know
i mean do you not destroy the fat man if you make him not fat
i guess so the it's quite the philosophical debate you're suggesting
there um because everything up to this point
has been sort of like surface level but that
that's what that's what'll be we'll have a whole leaf half of that i'm thinking
um i used to like nando i don't know his videos get
got boring and repetitive for me also he's good friends with patrick williams
um well you know friendship is fine i just um i haven't seen much of nando
vs movies uh jay said he was very good so everyone
can kick jay i suppose go for it he kicked himself today
he did uh cyanide is important for movie bob video watching
i mean i suppose it's subjective as well yeah the combo a nice cocktail
uh jay you lied to us kick him kick him now do it
oh he's he's he's already gone so yeah there we go
scuba chat has been fulfilled anna you're awesome also hashtag i stand
with vic um i don't know if there's any
developments on that whole situation but i assume it's calmed down now
um i guess but i don't know myself yeah i don't know
uh hi loves advice to apply movie clips into videos
um as best you can we're relevant maintaining
aspect ratio keep the resolution at least like
1080p yeah yeah high obviously high high quality footage if you can get it
um generally the expression of the character that you're showing
is really good because expressions even if they're quick you could just
boom you can understand it so if you can find if you're doing something
because i'm doing this with the vat woman thing i'm doing now
uh in a number of places but if you can find
someone on the footage who's using an expression
that you kind of want to convey with what you're saying
that's probably the way you want to go and if you keep it short like
under five seconds you generally never get pinged for you know copyright or
anything like that yeah and there are certain companies that
are much more lenient with the length of clips than others as well
so want brothers and lions gator generally
really bad and they'll try and claim anything
about netflix and uh if i forget a couple of other ones are pretty good
yeah um yeah because i was gonna say i used to advocate anything under 10
seconds but these days keep it under six if you want a
guarantee of never being clipped by the bot that's how insane it's getting
um or at least is with certain companies
but yeah hopefully uh you know you can sort of find your own
voice with it just uh be careful about the bots
um unacceptable tlj is trash i agree mate yeah fuck these
massives can we have more tonaled we should have some more tonaled soon i
think well we tonal's gonna have to give us more
tonal well there's he's got a big backlog we'll find something i'm sure of
it so i do want it i like new tonal like
fresh tonaled but you know can you do oh let me check
patreon and see if he responded to my message
oh yeah um arthur is part id and justification
he says he feared that he would feel remorse but after killing he felt
liberated instead the bad day broke that barrier to
transform him i think that's fair um
the scent of stale cigarettes and moldy brie assaults your nostrils like a
flabby fist as movie bob waddles out of the darkness
oh man i could almost smell that description i was gonna say yeah that was
almost yeah that was pretty uh that was pretty good
um i went to college with nando he was really wow he was super stoked to tell
everyone at a party how incredible pacific rim was when it came out loll
he's a good guy i'm sure he is uh that's what that's
what you'll typically find with a lot of these cases is they're they're
nice friendly people who just want to address their ideas
not every case though uh laugh my ass off imagine being the kind of
kazook that talks about pacific rim at a party loll
can't relate loser i think plenty of people talk about
movies at parties right it's fine yeah could be uh could be a gal yeah
what if what if the part doesn't like me talking about movies anymore
what if it's a room party to watch a film what about that
oh i mean you're at a party so you're being social that's the first step
conno suber the movie was the best movie of 2019
don't actually know oh yeah i'm unfamiliar with that
jay get on the discord and apologize for your sins
you got some explaining to do jay we should have asked him about that what does
he think about nando and if if it's that he's made a lot of
really good videos and he's just a bit tis me i'm joker i guess
maybe maybe we should watch more okay uh rags dealt with this view criticism
problem in his far cry 4 video view criticism problem
view criticism
i don't know what he's talking about view crit i yeah i don't quite know what
he's referring to by this view criticism view criticism
problem yeah i'm not 100 on that one yeah i'm not sure what you mean by that
um maula have you questioned the ethics of exposing your friends to all of this
unironically at what point is it literally torture
also sans is in smash good and uh they're free to leave whenever they
wish that is my logic whatever torture they end up engaging
with it's their fault
can we just get one critic that has an actual point i'm sick and tired of
people making up shiz like wow watch the freaking movie
well i mean more there is a pretty good critic that
brings up points well i think they mean cover someone because like
you know you're pretty good too sharp but we're not covering uri
we're uh and you know rags doesn't make movie reviews because he's a flim flam
you look at that silence he didn't deny it i don't i don't i don't make movie
reviews i'll make an episode review i got an
episode review going through that that'll be
long as shit
um then i'm gonna stick to shorter stuff just get them done
yeah we did cover uh for the first time today we pretty much watched a
movie a video in full and recommended them like we did it with ruby ruby
fuck now robot head ruby bob i was about to say
like what is that ruby bob ruby rose bob
uh ruby rob but yeah you know uh evan monroe made some points
there you go yes he did uh if if i had a grope
groiper black ops squad a and a deep state intel agency at my
disposal i'd use joker as a litmus test to help find and execute bug men
everywhere bug men huh there's a lot of words there
that i just don't know what the meanings are
i think they're to avoid uh the the super chat restrictions
but all right um nando vis's movies has broken efap holy mother of the dawn
we've been broken several times we usually recover though we just need
some time you know battery charge you know um i guess that last super chat
was talking about joker you know how you know there's the whole
thing where joker's gonna cause violence and stuff like that
there was a freaking like machete fight
uh in the uk at uh at a frozen 2 screening so
just just so that we know yeah it's everyone's aware
frozen 2 is a more violent is a more violent film
than joker is jenny had to go into a drive-in
like what are you saying you're trying to deny her experiences
frozen 2 is officially more dangerous than joker now and we have
the facts to prove it i like by the way that if that incident had happened
with joker imagine the coverage all that would be
everywhere
um yeah oh absolutely absolutely
okay more one upping cinema roberto with a nando is a strong move the efap crew
versus the tlj clique all out war is brewing also high rags wolf and guests
hey that can apply to you now shad hi ken hi
uh marie condo looking at the original trilogy this one sparks
joy marie condo looking at the sequel trilogy this one does not spark joy
i don't know who marie condo is but yes condo hmm yeah i don't know uh
kids wouldn't do this central park five i mean there's loads of examples of kids
doing kid things that can be interpreted as ass holy
oh yeah absolutely kids can be really cruel to one another
uh kids i don't think especially if kid hasn't like
fully developed a sense of you know like empathy yet
for other people and not all kids develop the same
same rate in the same way um kids are just outright cruel i blame the
parents cool kids aren't evil kids sometimes
yeah i was gonna say contextual kids aren't evil kids with low time
preference are evil
it's with low um or time preference in general
uh i don't know i don't know if uh
i don't know if it's uh i don't know if a kid can't be evil
we'd have to go to defining evil i mean assuming you're doing a
very in excessively malicious thing for the purposes of creating evil or knowing
something like that you know what we would consider evil like i mean a
child could be mentally like taking joy and excessive
informed malice uh that that would be one example probably
evil's many things i think we could agree but
um yeah i say it's possible it's possible
i wouldn't put it past him sneaky bastards
um i work as a psychologist in a low social
economic status town and i will say the depiction of mental illness and joke are
in a town like gotham is very much on point
these you these youtubers are a joke here's money for aspirin
thank you rags tell us a 40k bedtime story
40k bedtime story um once there was uh once there was a
lonely guardsman and he believes in the emperor
and therefore everything worked out well
that's all you need you didn't say happily ever after
no no no there's there there's not many happily ever afters in
but you said everything worked out well that was like the same
oh well for yeah oh well for like in a social sense
like not for him as an individual but you know he helped the team
okay all right i'm following yeah also hi rags
hello hi rags did you get the sword yet and what do you plan on doing with it
um gonna be around february ish that i get the sword
finally done and sent my way uh it'll be it will be mostly decorative
but it will also be it'll be decorative but
the fact that it exists there and i know that it's
sharp and deadly and that i possess it it provides
some kind of emotional satisfaction much needed
yeah most albans come sharp unless they're specifically the training type
and so yeah that was one of the things that i
emailed them beforehand i was like these are sharp right they're like yep
you want to you're gonna test it on anything before you put it on as
decorative you're gonna chop a piece of meat in half
i i'm certain i will find some way to use it
you do know how to um keep it like maintained don't you
um it'll rust it's a high it's not stainless steel these ones they're
high carbon spring i know i have i i haven't looked into it yet because
you know it's gonna be a while to get here anyway but i have stuff like like
i have firearms that i maintain i assume the principle is
pretty much the same well it's pretty easy you just need to keep the blade
oiled so it won't rust and mineral oil is the best
and you can find that in like baby oil is all mineral is like 100
oiled and stored in a cool dry place and all that stuff
yep yeah you're all good right it's uh yeah i got i've got uh
cleaning oil and stuff of that nature for guns so
i'll i'll i'll buy something that you know i'll buy something that's
for it and you can become a superhero if you wanted to protect the local
citizens from evil doers with the sword oh yeah absolutely someone said kill a
snake he's like well you got snakes here in
arkansas he'd be pretty nasty a lot of water snake types water moccasins
and cut mouths and all that
um
yeah he said what do you plan on doing with it deco test cutting
hammer question mark it's just decorative it'll just be
decorative there and for personal satisfaction
really just knowing that i have it is uh is a kind of value
um hello efap you get everyone should own a sword yes
hello efap you get one million dollars but you have to watch star wars episode
nine with movies bob would you do it yes
say that one more time experience you get one million dollars if you watch
episode nine with movie bob of course i mean there's a good chance i
might entertain that in general and maybe keep an eye on him
just to be like how does he react to films when he watches them does he like
is he like that eric butts guy at any point or is he just like
neutral i wonder hmm would be interesting i don't know i
could see it both ways first super chat just to say anna is cute
when she's angry make her angry more and high rags mauler and wolf especially
rags hello sexy doggo oh hey just how angry did anna get in
that stream frustrated yeah she definitely got frustrated
and she got frustrated when we went to the second video and we got a lot of
information from both videos to imply that like they hadn't
remembered the film right um the second video was like
everybody in the world is reprehensible there's like no good people and it was
like that but there's like a scene oh did he say
that yeah fucking hell really yeah we were like there's a whole scene that guy
okay i'm good no no no in the film oh in the film
not the midget that's what i mean there's a whole scene where that's
contingent upon what happens in the scene okay
uh love joker love joker content hate excessive
memory memory soft moric twaddle love efap mauler high iq analysis star wars
girl is tight too thank you sir all right
thank you very kind star wars girl is type two
no tight two ah um i was about to say like oh
what about the air traffic controllers strike isn't that the perfect example of
working class versus the government in the 80s
turns out even according to movie bob's comment section that he's very much
unaware of many relevant elements the things that happened in the 80s
um yeah what was the thing he said um you can't have a person taking seven
medications in the 80s because they'd be in a coma
that was one of his points yeah taking seven pills a day in the 80s that would
put you in a coma like okay as opposed to doing that in
the 90s or present day yes because medications are now much
less um they're much more spaced out prescribed thinner or
something like that oh okay oh yeah in 1990 you they they
passed a fda thing where the seven pill rule where
this pill has to be compatible with at least six others simultaneous if you
remember the exact wording of the bill was
cannot cause a coma all right yeah pretty neat well you know
well you know coma prevention act cpa yeah
um met a bloke who made the same argument about the layer scene in tlj
making the case that they're not really humans and that space in star wars
doesn't have the same effects on living beings as in our own
yeah okay
this this scene makes sense if we change space
and you might be like oh well they already did because they have sounded
space like sounded space isn't exactly changing much of anything in terms of
progression is it that's one of those that's like that's a movie thing that's
not an in-universe thing yes there's actually an argument to be
made about so like you know how soundtracks
can't necessarily exist in the in the movie unless it's like on radio
so technically if you want to make like a soundtrack can't occur naturally you
have to have like some kind of well sound effects and stuff and you just
like couldn't you argue that those things are the sound effects of the movie
to enhance the experience rather than a narrative flaw unless we have
characters reacting to the sounds i guess
that's true but i can't think of any instance where a character reacted to a
sound in space yeah i'd have to rewatch them and
really think about it um but yeah
all pack animals are dangerous especially when they are protected by
the law and booting one in the face or even grabbing one will land you in jail
really pack animals what does that um encompass
like pack animals like wolves yeah i was just thinking like what else do you
think that would cover also wait if you kick a wolf would you
be in trouble in the law if you kick a wolf the last thing you
need to worry about is what the popo we're gonna do to you
yeah you might want to run well running won't do much actually
i don't know i think at this point fuck it you've already crossed the line
assert dominance uh thomas eppstein didn't father arthur
i get it wolf have you seen cosmonauts videos
saying the watchman i'll save that for wolf
the question about watchmen the show that has pissed off a whole bunch of
people but hey i just i know nothing about it so i'm
staying away mostly oh no not the themes not the themes
oh and they're in my eyes my eyes
it's okay themes are okay you'll survive um
i have seen a youtuber by the name of wolf on you podcast in the past did he
delete his channel or something i can't find him
i don't know if that's supposed to be like tongue in cheek but
it could be a new person could be a new person could be someone new
maybe someone new um he's the same guy who is now back
and his channel is called of writing and rage rather than
the word of wolf and uh he actually recently got monetized
so uh gonna be kicking oh that's good yeah and getting this very good korea
going i think or at least um youtube going yeah i really hope so
you're telling me a femoid and an eagle femoid no less turned out to be evil and
a sociopathic dog abuser imagine my shock loll repeal 19
oh raw dog abuser down with all dog abusers
what was the sign you held up a dog eater dog eater yeah yeah
anna stop moaning this is a christian podcast
oh i guess when she gets angry she has a grunty
yeah wolf because of you i'm listening to the expanse not even finish book one
and i'm hooked it's great mauler give this to him
please also hi rags hello i will and i'll hang on to that i
mean it's not so many necessary has to respond to but i'll just keep it for him
as well was fringy's uh moan in the stream or
was that just before we started um that was then the stream i think i
hope it was in the stream because i think someone could fuck with that
it was quite embarrassing for him just disappoint out that uh yeah we point
that out for everyone not just girls absolutely
um on the comparison to taxi and comedy king
i think those older movies are deeper because those movies have more time to
get reviewed in depth and these reviews became popular over time
i think that's completely fair um it's almost like
people want to race to the deep meaning of joker
and declare if it's there or not immediately when taxi driver and king of
comedy have had decades for people to discover and discuss
that so yeah i think that's a fair point uh where have you considered cool in
high school i wasn't i mean i i wasn't really either way for me
i got along with pretty much everybody but i wasn't
really like in any super social groups i i sort of i got along with everybody
i was it's a pretty unremarkable i suppose at least in terms of
my place in this high school social hierarchy
you know i was just i was just around didn't have any enemies or anything
yeah i'd never call myself popular i was uh
on friendly terms with most people towards the end though there were
like you know a handful of jerks that i didn't like and they didn't like me and
they were generally more popular than me those ones i didn't like but on
overall it was just mostly amicable towards
the end though earlier on i did you know get picked on
until i beat them up and then it starts i was gonna say they encouraged you to
study the blade didn't they i was studying the blade for a long time
before then as uh they were always a bit surprised
that i knew how to handle myself when it came to it
i was uh totally in more if there were sectioned off into groups it would have
been like the video game group of people who would have like ds
as psp's and laptops and always play on games watch
movies or tv shows or just talk about stuff while
maybe there was sporting things or crafts or chess clubs all these
different like tea trees they would just be like nah we want to
hang out play media and stuff um and mostly mostly liked i from what i
remember and i i had the benefit of being a real life longoid i was like
six foot very early on so uh not many people could do much if they wanted to
do bully stuff um i could just fall on them and i'd win
really handy
also mauler and others if applicable thoughts on the simpsons movie
it was fine i don't think it was uh harshly bad or anything but it also
is far away from where where the golden age of simpsons was
i don't know if you guys have seen it have you yeah once
and uh it was a movie can you say that objectively i think i
can pretty sure was it a movie now um
so wolf i saw that you found out what a map was on twitter still kind of hard
to believe that god forsaken hellhole has gotten worse
that's a minor attracted person yeah that's what it stands for
yes i had no idea uh kick j gib rag
is that gib rag yes give me what i'm not sure
uh forget uh forgot to add that you have to do a review with him for watching the
star wars episode nine with bob for a million dollars i do a review with
him i don't know if the requirements are
that we actually have to complete the project before he kicks me out of it but
i'm pretty sure i disagree with him at most of every turn i'd be like
um you know when you say this crazy thing
how do you support it and then he's like oh i don't want to have to work with you
diabeto's true arch enemy is sportacus from lazy town
also j longbone has the best laugh i've ever heard
she does have a good laugh yeah she does have a good one there are a
couple people who will be diabeto's true arch enemies but sportacus is a good
choice diabeto's uh maps i prefer to hit the road
in my car play a playlist drive till it ends then search for a cafe
or whatever and pull into a random town burn all maps i say
okay wolf what the hell is lord of the rings i think you mean
jab of the rings true jab of the rings
uh wakine phoenix is brown i don't believe he's brown but
perhaps i haven't checked him in recently
um maybe he identifies as brown maybe i have not asked him
it'll be my third time watching if it is in
that's all that says it'll be my third time watching if it is in
i don't know what to make of that but okay this one just says kill me
i think we must have been covering more movie bob at that point
yeah probably mola can you please refute all the tism arguments when you
make your video praising this film i'll probably go as far as showing a
montage of like when you get people making a lot of the
similar comments um so definitely the king of comedy
and joker comparisons or driver uh taxi driver
and then um i can't remember if there was like other
ones probably just about like a theme compilation of some kind
that'll be kind of fun but i'll mostly stay away from it because i like to
involve reviewers more when i'm doing a longer
thing um fuck off back to your hallmark movie
you massive p massive p hallmark movie oh literally all
this guy has done is describe a completely different movie and asserted
it's better said movie may very well be good because you can't make a move good
movie out of anything you can make a good movie out of anything
but it's not inherently better if he's got a foil or not it's just a
different movie ah there you go we're on to the second
video in the super chest now get there somebody please purge this bad
righting zito bad rewriting zito well we kind of did by the end of that
video i think sort of well what the hell did we do to
deserve this these holes the guy who it was a guy they were
both guys nothing it's a gift oh wait they mean the
guests i mean i was gonna say that's dollars girl
and jay longburn awesome guests yeah they were good holes uh looks like
we found the spelled with a k i was gonna say
could so i think they want to go they're really
forgotten uh the proof read the last jedi oh i mean
nando according to jay he wasn't a fan or at least he was only half a fan of tlj
so perhaps a runie
do do hey masses have you seen the bionicle web of shadows the animation is
dated and it's cheesy to the max but i think it's a surprisingly good story
i've not seen it i have i haven't seen any of the bionicle movies
i didn't realize there was such like almost nostalgia for them a lot of
people seem to be aware of and like the bionicle movies and i was like okay
yeah i i see him referenced in meme and stuff of like bionicle lore and stuff
like that maybe there's uh maybe there's something to
them i don't know i remember the toys i i remember when
they first came out uh jeez rag your monthly thrust is
lasting a while no i wish i haven't even i haven't
even had the first monthly thrust not even yeah
poor guy he's not even getting his thrust terrible
oh i i've got man's got needs mm-hmm uh which team would you like to write
star wars episode nine nando and bob or ruin and jaja
oh shit
basically do you think nando and bob would do a better job than what we have
yeah and i don't know uh god could you imagine a movie made by bob chipman
um you know what out of morbid curiosity yeah i was gonna say like i
wouldn't mind it just to see what they do yeah poor nando wouldn't realize what's
gonna happen to him bob would consume that man and yeah it'll be it'll be
horrible chris cuckman he'd wear the relationship
stuckman's anger at rich perfectly mirrors that of arthur to murray it's
like pottery it's like pottery it's like pottery
um hell yeah i had bionicles axon takanuva brutaka visorak bogorak
kilorak zoomers know what's good we had the best toys
i remember a lot of uh a lot of those names yeah i i could still definitely
remember how some of them looked that was raw by the way
oh yeah and uh yeah i remember bionicles i had them as well
i remember bionicles they came out and they'd have a little new ones here and
new ones there and kind of add to it over time
is this guy related to ryan johnson there's a good chance not going to
confirm it um episode seven when jay longbone called
jacob a pimp i fucking died yeah jacob a pimp joke book he gets
what he deserves this guy's revision for joker turns
it into a jeff the killer level piece of creepypasta cringe
um yeah there's a lot of things wrong with uh
understanding it was it sucks right you missed you missed the whole video it was
really bad you would you've you've you're better off for it but that
disappoints me because you must suffer with the rest of us
uh dodge the bullet had my own things going on but
yeah i i hear he was i think i was there for part of it
possibly yeah i think in the beginning maybe i can't remember i think i was
there for for a pretty good portion of it no it
was it was bad it was bad uh out of ryan johnson jj abrams and
david benny off who do you feed to a ravenous horde
of sexually aroused dodos basically i go with benny off
um so ryan jj or benny off
i don't know ryan isn't he's a prick he really is
he's an asshole that dude's just spiteful
yeah i'm thinking i'm thinking competent yeah jj just seems um
i don't know kind of yeah a little bit and then david benny off
i don't know what dnd were thinking but at least they destroyed something they
made as opposed to destroying something someone else made
i don't know if that's slightly more virtuous but i mean yeah
yeah uh i'd probably go with ryan they kept the mess to their own kitchen you
know i'd like to clarify my earlier super chat
saying he's described a potentially good movie
only the high concept joker with a direct foil it's potentially good
everything else here is aids that also gives you cancer oh
i mean this is the thing i always like those different kinds of premises i'll
give them a shot it's tough to make certain ones work
more so than others like some of them could write themselves to a degree but
yeah that one he had at the premise level could work i
mean a lot of people are looking to see if harley quiddon can be the foil for
joker right
maybe maybe in a movie without batman i mean
potentially sure potentially so i don't know if that's gonna
annoy comic fans i don't know if that's how she operates in comics or not
i just i just don't care if it's like your comic book or not
i know you got super chat just says poop
oh i've done that hmm please bring back diabeto at least he was a good
joke to laugh at plus i remember him sacrificing his food for his mother going
hungry himself
i remember him sacrificing his food for his mother going hungry himself
diabeto unless they're saying that movie bob did that i don't know if it's if
that's the thing that he did it sounds kind of funny he doesn't look
like the kind of guy who would sacrifice food for anybody
so basically he wants joker to be cliche and woke
oh yeah rags there was this moment where he says like oh so the girl turns out to
be imaginary right and he's trying to explain this better
she's not but he also says like hey and you know
not too great to make your only uh only significant character who's
a female a female of color person is imaginary
fuck off it's a it's a really bizarre comment and you could only conclude
there's like you shouldn't have people of color be imaginary okay
or at least the it's right she's not even imaginary she's a real person it's
just he imagines the relationship it's a very real moment people said her
trail is really good of that role and i'm like yeah just
these people these people when they say these people are never satisfied
well maybe there's something to that one gets that impression
often arthur went hungry so his mother couldn't
could eat is that something that happens in joker i really need to see that film
again
i can't remember yeah i can't remember this is my favorite guest line of jay
longbone anna and wags
more poops thank you the joker is about a guy who uses
scissors and becomes violent do you use scissors oh yeah he does
it's the yeah yeah yeah he didn't run with him so no he
didn't run with him first safety first good film for that you
know showing what we shouldn't shouldn't do we watched a time to kill in
criminal justice class fair enough hope you enjoyed what for
i wonder um rip boogie 2988 sad face i'm sure he's
oh did he die again i'm sure he's fine um last time i checked his channel wasn't
going too well well he's going through a lot of um
fuck ups to say the least i think he's doing okay well he's he's
not said anything terrible recently dare i say
i don't actually who knows what we missed yeah that's a good point i don't
exactly keeping tabs on him but you know i haven't heard anything
and i usually hear about it if it's something bad but
yeah i've not heard anything really terrible um
oh good job i think averaging about a hundred thousand views a video
with his recent stuff that's a bit better than uh
what he was probably before and that's enough
yeah that's enough it'll be enough to get by but it's uh shadow compared to
what he used to pull in yeah i think he's talking about a book or
something i'm not sure oh what that was referencing
specifically because it would have been in that video i think
jay is allowed very true he is um yeah when i get my firearms license
in two months i'm obviously going to go to one
uh go ice a fuck at the moment i get my shiny new browning 1911
oh yeah i can't even remember specifically he has like
he said that um joker when looked through the lens of like a study called
the trigger pulls the finger uh
if joe he says something like if joe is about anything it's about a madman being
given a gun and then choosing to kill people
or something like that it was really annoying oh oh so you know he kills
people with a pair of fucking scissors right
he did that because he had a gun right oh okay
idiot like you don't even know a gun's wick
nope no clue all in his head endings are almost always lazy bs
i mean i can probably agree with that um it's it's nice if there's a whole
bunch of plotting or details that could lend themselves
toward the idea at the end sort of thing instead of just saying
boom it was all in his head you're like what um
i can't think there's that a lot of examples on top of my head of stories
that do that but uh not typically a huge fan of it myself
um i also say the simpsons movie is objectively good
i mean i'd have to watch it again i don't remember having that much of an
issue with it yeah i haven't even seen it came out a
while ago though didn't it yeah that was like 2000 i want to say
eight i could be wrong simpson's movie
dozen seven i was close okay so this is this is a weird super chat
just says hmm harder daddy hmm
hmm oh yes hong kong number one and then a clown emote
and i can't tell what that is another remote
i interpret the ending of joker as it's ending where it starts with no one
caring or understanding joker now delights in suffering and finds this
funny
i mean yeah it's pretty explicit right the seeing the world
instead of reacting to it as it's all a bad thing reacting to it like it's all
hilarious this all ended up this way and i think that's kind of a great time
nailed right in when he thinks about the child standing in an alleyway with his
dead parents and he says that that's he's like laughing
hey wolf you see any bad anime or manga i will save this question joker critics
the bad stuff that happens in the joker is unrealistic history am i a joke to
you i mean seems like it just a little bit
we've uh we've done three podcasts on joker takes now
oh boy and there's more to come so many joker takes
really man some people just oh they just don't get it uh stop putting
flutes in your mouth we put willies in our mouths in the us
is that true ranks willies what does you put willies in your mouth in the
all right yeah every once in a while you know
just uh keep it keeps you sharp you know
democracy is non-negotiable i like it giving you money as proof that
capitalism will always prevail over communisms
yeah boy we're going to that way we're gonna build a wall and make the flute
musicians pay for it
that was looters yeah because we had that we do you remember
when we got spammed or does that not sound familiar to you
no we had like um i think i can't remember the name of the spam account
but it was a person that used multiple accounts
and they were spamming this like chinese paragraph and when translated it
literally offered its opinion on joker which is pretty crazy and it was that is
really strange um i don't even think that movie came
out in china i don't know but i mean a chinese person
could watch it right or maybe that's the meme to be like a
fucking american who's like i'm gonna translate my view
into chinese and spam it on efap just to get them to be curious enough to read
it i mean it worked yes he was um someone
made a meme about like a flute man who was that account
and uh he's already made it made it into that big uh
meme picture yeah so that was a good guy all right
um the length of efap has allowed me to flex on my friends in ways i never
thought possible thank you for making the 10-hour work
day so much faster no pro blemo oh you bet i'm glad it
helps to go through quicker we need a mod bot named liberty prime
who deletes flute musician better dead than red
i remember liberty prime oh wait no sorry is that four because there was a
robot in uh yeah they do them in both okay
three and four uh wait what is fluke saying anyway is he a commie
he was reviewing joker reviewing joker kick the flautist and j oh he got
kicked eventually j rah go get rah's pagoda rooftop honestly
though spamming a chat to get you support that loses your support if
anything they didn't think that through though
when you get like you're brand new on let's say twitch and you're streaming
for zero viewers you might be like if i spam my link into somebody's chat
i might just get enough of them to be curious enough to click on it and one
viewer is better than zero so it's worth it
so it's like and then they'll arrive and be like oh
i can see why you have zero viewers and they'll leave i mean if you have an
amazing stream stream you might actually be able to get a fan that way but i
wouldn't recommend it it's extremely ass holy it's not organic you know
that's the way it's supposed to be
um helicopter the flute commies bill freebo hong kongings
bill freebo hong konging rah forget the roof through the
wait raf forget the roof through the chinaman off the wall
oh i get it oh yes i'm gonna say throw the chinaman but yes
you can't see a very long roof oh yeah yeah if you're strong enough you
can throw him really high off it and then the the resulting landing will
get quite a bit i think so you can't seize the memes of production
very true ending of the beginning he means the middle
it's all the middle indeed it is meant to say throw oh there you go
uh i feel like this guy is the kind of guy who would like the twilight movies
oh nando i don't know maybe i only painted him his way
i for the record i'm not the flute musician
i believe you for now hello fellow humans free king kong
Epstein did nothing wrong i think those are the memes
uh go to the dentist nando your teeth are yellow
well well oh no yeah you can get some teeth whitening stuff now
you know it's not over if they're yellow you can do some stuff
um anti-effaps assemble my goodness one punch was soiled from that point on
forever after oh yeah he said that uh yeah yeah so he
had an ad rags where he said that um yeah he's on this like website where you
can get his content earlier than on youtube and i was like okay
and he said that there's this if you subscribe to this website you get
access to this other thing and it's a thing where there are content
creators that are making like this the way he described it was like
there'll be a topic and then everyone will make a video for
it and you can watch them all together at once and he said the one they just
did was talking about the best title sequences
in like tv shows and the one he did was one punch man
and like the creators he referenced were like just right patrick williams was
like no no no no
let's say yeah they do a lot of collaborative stuff and it's like oh
that's that's kind of cool it's you know good for you guys keep it up
yeah um are those guys y'all's legion of doom
uh a little bit yeah a little bit they're not blinking it's a trap he's
trying to turn more people into nandroids robot youtubers were rising up
i mean you really think an android would hold the opinions that he does
come on now give androids a little bit more
credit um wanted to thank efap and mauler your
videos have showed me how to better justify my arguments have evidence in
the script and a well-worded delivery as a sound
design student it's been so useful i'm glad for that yeah that's great man
hopefully it has been helpful and i mean you saw it with the other video
we put on we really like it when videos just
got high production values including script writing it's just like oh
what a welcome release from the the sludge like the week out youtube
uh the only thing cineblob said that was ever right was that ghost in the shell
live action is not as good as the original
i don't know anybody who's said the reverse of that i've always heard yeah
i i i liked the live action one um but yeah i could see why
it's it not as good as the original and i love the
the show i really love the show i love standalone complex and
second gig and even arise i thought was all right
but i'm a big ghost to the shell fan you mean you're a freaking weeb
i guess if that makes me a weeb i i haven't watched i couldn't tell you the
last time i watched an anime though wow like i
legit couldn't tell you i have no idea why'd you hit anime i just don't care
well that's okay um you're right long bone he's not tempting
you he's tempting you to commit suicide two drum symbol
oh i get it like the sound effect um just tuned in so miss the no doubt
amazing joker takes can't wait to see the mooler upload
oh man and it's not even up yet but it will be
the wait won't be much longer yeah the people who are watching this live who
may have missed that stream it's kind of funny that they'll be getting that one
out before this one so it might line up better for them than a lot of people but
hey them's the isms um i'm going to sleep
now good night everyone also hi rags good night and
hi hi and good night if you re-watch the rise of skywalker
trailer you can see the spelt forever as fulva
why do i doubt that one of them super high production thingy's like
do you mean like the first trailer also how would no one else have mentioned
this to us like the whole they would have spelt forever as
fulva fulva fulva
yeah i mean that came from the account darth maul would darth maul lie to us
i don't think so
uh why are we still talking about joker charlie's angels is out
we're gonna go see charlie's angel well yeah good critical drinker's video i'm
surprised he even made it i was like why did you go see that
elizabeth the maker of it blames you for its failure
that um i didn't know drinker made a video i don't know i'm gonna have to
watch that it's it's so like so bitter the um
elizabeth banks
poor poor woman just want to i guess it's because it's her first like
significant outing as a director and this might actually determine the rest
of her career so maybe she's just super pissed about that
yep blame everyone else my own ability
um wolf here's some aspirin money for movie blob
very kind of you wolf i'll appreciate it uh youtube gave me money for some
reason rhino milk's on me massive thank you very much maul in america
middle school is indefinite i get it
the middle's the longest part god school systems aren't even the same
across the uk never mind trying to understand the americisms
yeah that's what i thought was that uh it changes even in britain alone
u.s doesn't use metric system meaning uk is better
um i mean you know you gotta let them do their thing
that was the whole point we were like hey you guys you go take that bit of
land over there and do your thing so if they choose that system let them
choose it all right it's not for us to judge isn't that right rags
yeah you wouldn't want to be insecure and cold or
closed-minded and immature yeah
metric system is the absolute big gay and this is a separate account
saying metric metric system is the big gay apparently a lot of people think the
metric system is the big gay i don't know what to say about that
hmm i don't know i like it
therefore i like miles per hour but i like uh
i like the rest of the metric stuff like quarts and gallons and all that
volume is a nightmare you don't like loud soup loud soup
yeah man i think is there a metric for volume or is it all like
like decibels yeah i mean yeah there's probably more to it than that as well
yeah maybe uh my elementary school was kindergarten to fourth grade then i went
to an intermediate school which was fifth and sixth grade then middle school
which was seventh and eighth and finally four years of high school
wow all right um alice kills her man i'm calling it
oh do you mean dodgeson oh my god regs if we're doing the finale for
alice's storyline we might not even see dodgeson now
no he's captured surely i hope he's still in this i need the end to dodgeson's
story he's my favorite yeah i gotta know how is
our thing i need him to i need him to say to jacob
you know what the crows aren't even really that bad it's just my inner
conflict i need that
i kind of figure out just their their relationship and their motivation and
their deep and and carefully explored back stories and
flesh out just what they're doing and why and we're never gonna such good show
i think i think the rifle said he was working for sophia maybe sophia carmine
coming in soon also calling that christopher fistifer
was framed uh well yeah we know he was oh you mean
framed originally it's possible he was called the fist
in the um the executioner episode um this is the thing about luke's trouble
does he know that that guy killed his dad because if he doesn't know it for
sure and it was actually like just decided upon by the prosecutor
who apparently prosecuted innocent people you
might want to be like did the guy actually do it or not
you know because he's like sad that the guy got out of prison or might do
through a retrial like the luke well if this was
a show in that was far better developed and
characters that we gave a shit about then man that could have actually been
something we cared about yeah but never mind have you seen any
batwoman chat like uh yourself or you need to see
oh actually i don't want to harm myself that much just yet
but i have been enjoying the commentaries on them
and that has not made me want to watch it anymore
oh have you have you seen our commentaries on them some of them
not not all of them and oh there's not a single episode that hasn't essentially
made us laugh out loud with a some form of an explosion or something
really yeah it's really really bad that's the worst shot at the same i'm
really hoping that the next set of episodes they've been approved to film
are going to be even worse because these are more on a timeline than the
other ones where they first started and maybe had more i'm just i'm just hoping
they rushed and they do even worse please give me all those lols
i think the rifle said he was oh yeah so yeah so fear
uh could be the replacement bad guy once uh
alice has put in jail or arkham i'm almost certain alice is going to arkham
school's different i don't think they're gonna yeah i don't think they'll kill
her out spend too much time trying to make us sympathize with that psychopathic
murderer mhm schools differ on a state by state basis
that makes sense yeah uh yes all my best youtubers at the
same time hello wolf so great to see you again hope you're doing great
i have to go to work now so here's some of the money i earned without tax
knowing about it all right and uh yeah you'd appreciate
um about to sleep and almost done with efap 50 i love you masters i love the
idea that someone's just finished 50 and they try to catch up to us and we're
like running away with how long these episodes are we're like
like you can't catch this one's like seven or so hours right now
yep i'm tired we've not actually hit the current episode super chats yet
oh man yeah we'll have to go i guess we gotta
metals in the chat really guys again i didn't mean to
it's this one's only been like seven hours yeah it's not even seven hours
bell what the hell most podcasts are like that long
when you consider them in and in and amongst other podcasts put together and
add it to the time okay so it makes sense yeah i mean if they do a daily
podcast technically they're doing like you know
seven hours a week that's about the same as efap
um movie bob does a podcast and i think it's either weekly or bi-weekly but um
he his is like 40 minutes it's like 40 minutes fucking hell
week we don't have time for an intro yeah i know we usually don't finish our
intro at that point um it's okay anna height is subjective
oh yeah because she's like i think she's like five foot
um or even less than that i think she has to she said i think she said she
had to have a booster seat um in certain was it certain states or
to a certain age i think she said oh that's cute
because yeah i mean you know you've got to make sure that seatbelt actually
applies or something but yeah um short safety first everyone
mm-hmm good old enemy don't want to use the bell crying about
uh i'll admit scrappy wasn't that bad thanks anna
didn't everyone hate scrappy or i didn't realize people is a piece of
shit scrappy like and wrong i didn't think i thought you hate
scrappy too right even though you don't know much about scooby do
uh yeah like because i don't like scooby do i'd say i hate scrappy by
naturally extension yeah scrappy was a piece of shit
he was the villain like scooby doo was so damn predictive
predictable and the animation of the original was so crap where i was always
side shots moving just locked all right and everything
oh yeah kids need why are you attacking the
monster just happened to be the only one person that we met
right before we went into this movie wherever yeah like they entered the cave
or whatever this is creepy old man who's just like oh there's a ghost in there
don't go in there it's dangerous and then it turns out to be him you know oh
man winkle bottom what are you doing how can we call her winkle bottom
like sometimes i just get the feeling kids watch
stuff because it's there and they have no real you know
um i don't know like um my kids watch even today
some of the crap they watch on youtube i'm like
wow even scooby doo's better than this uh a lot of you know you they do that
thing right where you go i haven't watched this since i was a kid i don't
actually know if it's as good as i remember that's the thing we often say
and like four seconds in you're like oh god oh jeez
oh no i was dumb
can we get a puppy power from anna please oh i mean i can ask you the next
time she comes on a bit of a strange one but i'm sure she'll
be okay with it well that's what scrappy would say
that's what i just think that's his like that's his that's that little shit's
stupid fucking catchphrase was puppy power
that's what he'd say i remember i'm like oh god you're just
how how did you make yourself more hateable you managed it
and you know rags is biased toward doggos guys so you know this is
genuine yeah man like uh like scrappy to us is like
hitler to you guys
uh whatever happened to that cg animation of mauler rags and wolf his
dark jedi i believe uh we had the two episodes
and i think he said he was working on a third one but um
he can't rush genius and that stuff was amazing
so uh but yeah i i imagine we'll get a third eventually
and um i'll be looking forward to it all the brush art
all the bob bulges from his donut cock ring donut cock ring all right
oh my uh movie bob has been a part of efap since the first 10 episodes
how has it taken this long for him to become a meme well diabeto
needed specific circumstances to be created you see
that's why there's only one that's why he's special
i'll just you know it doesn't just happen there's only one diabeto
and besides like he really hurt wolf on the first time we covered him he like
you know he knocked him out for a while
you gotta you gotta take these things into consideration um
detective ham hock was already a show called canon
i have no idea but yeah i mean ham hock is probably the name of somebody i
thought it was based on something it's just funny
i like it um
the main reason he's hated is uh he became the rest of the gang
also given 10 years jay wait sorry the main reason he's hated
cause he became the rest of the gang i think scrappy yeah scrappy became the
rest that's right they did they did a later like secondary series where
suddenly it was only um scooby shaggy and scrappy and all the
other characters were just absent they weren't there
oh i see what you mean
um yeah that's uh uh that's a bad also give him 10 years jay
uh give him 10 years jl he will be the size of a macy's day balloon
also ifap watts
i don't know ifap watts yeah i'm guessing that macy's day parade balloon
is a reference to movie bob but ifap watts
i don't know spell that uh well it's wats ifap watts
i don't know
ifap watts uh you know guys oh yeah go ahead
sorry i might have to keep going now um families are lacking their morning
dinner so it's been seven hours you're right
yeah i wish i could stick around but dinner's here and it's pizza
maybe i'll come back up the pizza we'll see how we go but uh
yeah you can always drop in drop out but i was gonna say do you want to um
talk about your channel even though i'm pretty sure you're you're almost ifap
family now but i don't even care i appreciate that guys i feel like
family and um talk about why they should subscribe do it
well uh well it turns out i can be a bit of a longman too
and i have a new series on my channel called fight scene autopsy
where i literally reviewed like five minutes of uh fights for five and it's
turned into maybe 40 minutes of content of what i'm reviewing so
highly detailed pedantic stuff about sword and medieval stuff and it's all
lots of fun have you checked out the fight scene
autopsy videos yet yeah i watched the um the tlj
throne room one um oh wow i've got a backlog of videos to go through but yeah
that was uh you've you've got the top evisceration
of that i suppose thank you that like it is amazing how
bad that fight scene is when you really break it down
like into every individual move the combatants take it's like
what yeah and uh if you listen to the behind the scenes
i've said this before i just it just boggles my mind ryan johnson said
that they've learned the sequence so well that he can just
record wherever he wants with the camera and it'll work
and i was like so on one hand they have not recorded uh
developed the choreography well enough i'm sorry but like
loads of it makes no sense at all and secondly he cuts it up
like if you had it so you honestly believe the entire sequence was down
from memory by all the people like wouldn't you want it to be one big long
amazing one shot instead of yeah he cuts around a lot so it's just
like okay interesting take but yeah um it's good
stuff go and check it out if i wanted to i just didn't want to
so there yeah the link's also in the description thank you for hanging out for
so long uh mr shad and we shall have you back in
the future for more yeah objective tisms i'm sure
in my pleasure i might be back um a bit later on in this stream or i might not
we'll see how i go but if not it's been a pleasure fellas as
always and thank you thank you you bet all right there he is see
you bye bye bye and then there were two
and i'm gonna turn off my heater is this getting
hot getting hot hot hot
um okay theory this whole stream was merely a ruse to get us to make bob fan
art i don't think he'd like the fan art though
i found out jack saint blocked me on twitter over the tax and pronouns thing
and i can't help but share how happy i feel
i mean no loss there i mean he'd get a block plan is not exactly gonna
stop you from enjoying twitter or anything so you'll be fine
yeah uh jay jay longbone love you vid on afro boy confronting abortion lady
will the efap gang and jay longbone record themselves on a wrinkle of time
soon a wrinkle in time soon yes actually i
really want to set that up before uh episode nine comes out actually so
actually yeah let's do it i mean i'm very encouraged to do it i just need to
find the right time i'll probably talk to her
uh tomorrow maybe about figuring out when we
can do it that sounds good i'd like that bring
alcohol gotta be insane uh hey i'm at work on the
pooper when i saw your stream keep up the good streams my dude
absolutely poopy streams aren't so bad you saw it you saw it from the pooper
he did he was on the pooper looking at his stuff on the phone
source right there i guess it was a phone
i doubt he has um his laptop or his full pc and tower on the
toilet but you know some people that's the way they want to live that's fine
some people are big on efficiency let's call it a throne and you're done
uh hey massives thoughts on equilibrium starring bale
uh i like it um i haven't watched in a long time now though
yeah so i don't know what i would say about it but um
he rescues a doggo in the film so definitely
already five points good guy he's a good man he's a good man
uh also do you think the protagonist is a gary stu
i think he is but he has a good character unlike ray
so and his whole point is that he's like what he does is
is special like he's uh he's very good at gun kata right um
yeah but he does get found out and subvert a couple times a lot of
characters really don't like him and um i guess i would need to re-watch it
but i suppose he gets through most of the plot
pretty easily i don't know um possibly i can't recall specifics yeah um
and female i did not see her when i sent original super chat
that's the guy who said he saw it when he was on the pooper oh
but yeah all right judging from the double standards out there movie bob
was wrong there are no bad targets only bad
shooters
i mean yeah bad he's certainly a just bad person like this
he's like no bad just a shitty person yeah he's cruel and vindictive and full
of malice man like i've never like i've never seen him
like happy he needs to see the light of the dawn
then he will be free yeah he needs uh he needs something he needs a
intervention can you picture like we we get the dawn to just
you know look into that and like as movie bob is writing his next review
like the dawn walks into his room and he's like how about a smile for me
movie bob's like he like does the thing from uh the body statches
just voids oh yeah screams
um
okay uh i am firmly convinced that if movie bob was in charge of jimmy during
world war two way more people would have died
i mean yeah it would be the inquisition style
thing where you'd just be like what is your opinion on x
and um you better not answer that question wrong
um i'm firmly convinced that if oh sorry i'm
on three say knobs intro welcome hello and welcome to no bullshit
hello and wait oh wait so on three say knobs is intro which is
hello and welcome to no bullshit you have to do it in his voice as well
though right it's like hello and welcome to no bullshit
yeah suppose we can give it a shot well i mean
i guess if you wanted it to get done together if you've said it and i've said
it you can easily edit that together right what does he actually want it how
i said it oh he's gonna say it together but do we
do it on our voices for an impression of him
we do it in our impression of him okay so on three so it's hello and welcome to
no bullshit yeah all right one two three
hello and welcome oh he didn't even do what the fuck no bullshit
you know it's tough to say i'll just i've done it separately i'm pretty sure
you have they could edit that together i don't
even know it's um i don't even know this for a
meme or just to fuck around but hey well either way hello and
welcome to no bullshit and who makes fantastic videos
here's some he's so smart and clever for the surprise midweek efap also the
two women to look at one for each eye there you go
diabeto at full power versus three zombified ginger sheep that constantly
scream debates are gay and stop talking about

old man goldstein i'm afraid
unless i've put it down somewhere that one may be lost to time
oh no old man goldstein i'm not sure which one it refers to
i mean old man goldstein alone chat list you might have to control f for it
it was from zac gillbert he sent in um uh a few um
i will try and look for it uh a little later
i'll have to load up many for all of the uh the episodes and then just
make sure i catch it i think it's from the same one oh man
i will try and look into it did i miss bob's video i'm not sure if i
should be glad to be spared stupidity or sad i didn't get to see your brain cells
committing suicide i'll just take the w i was gonna say
you uh you can find your way back to it if you
want to uh please get john cjg on the combo between you two about writing
would be golden plus i know his sense of humor would fit right in here
looks at rooftop and then pile of corpses also praise the dawn
praise the dawn and yeah um i mean i'll i'll give it a shot i'll send a
message on the old twitter to john cjg he's uh the guy who made
arby and the chief if he's interested we could give it a shot
um i would kill both my parents with a hammer if it meant i got to see a
mandingo fight between brett keene and movie bob
oh my goodness um i don't know if i go that far
personally but i mean i would pay a decent chunk of buddy to see that
um you're in charge of a new buffy spin-off but it can't start any of the
scoobies or team angel or anyone else works what would your
basic premise be so there's a couple i'd like to do i
think the story's gonna get complicated if we set it after the events of buffy
considering how it ends i might want to set it uh
be slayer before buffy basically and maybe make a story about that
or do a ripper show i think that would make a lot of sense
um we'll go for spike spike specific show
you know there's a lot of options you can have and screw with the narrative
um and without going into too much depth uh
i'd be game to test out a lot of things but i wouldn't want to do the same thing
because buffy exists and it's great we can just have that
look up diabeto family guy clip online we did
and um yeah they have a diabeto joke it's not quite the same but it's um
hey it's pretty good uh what would you guys like to see from
the matrix four i don't want to see it
is this happening right that's a question i don't get
asked often um go away i don't want it either but if you're
if we have if there has to be one i don't even know what we can make it about
yeah because it's all finished like are we just gonna see a different
cycle or something i don't know humans and machines working together it's
sure something goes wrong maybe a third force of some kind
like the humans and aliens of most not sorry the humans and machines are mostly
working together but then there's some kind of alien force that invades
no because we'll have to see what they want to do but
i would err on the side of safety and just be like let's not
let's not um efap war of the tisms yes saving efap 69 for star wars nine
i don't think we'll make it to 69 before star wars in fact
we're on 62 now we'll have 63 on the first
four 65 right now it's looking like it'll be 66
for episodes with for episode nine which i think is very very cool
yeah
um every one of these movies is practically hard nut to crack
there's no source material um is it particularly hard nut to crack
there's no source material we don't have comic books we don't have 800 page
novels kathleen kennedy no really this was
recently yeah i know she's insane i love the idea that she's arguing
that it's harder to write something when you when you're not adapting it but
it's like that's not even there are pros and cons to that process i'll have you
know and you're the one who got rid of all
that stuff you're the one who said all the
extended universe that wealth that treasure trove didn't count anymore and
you're like oh no now we don't something to copy oh maybe you
should have thought ahead stupid
uh mola did you read my diabeto origin chat
in origin story in chat i don't know possibly not though probably not i
mean i don't remember reading the story
about it in chat unless i read it out myself i guess um
30th season by the way someone euthanized the simpsons now
to be honest with you if you'd asked me i probably would have said they must be
past the 30th season by now like if they're still going you'd
thought i honestly would have thought they were up to like 40th but hey yeah
that's where they are please do an efap where batman eats toothpaste
do an efap an efap where batman eats toothpaste
not sure i follow on that one uh also you should play cataclysm dda

i guess i can marry myself i'll be self-partnered as
i don't actually know i don't think you can marry yourself
you could fuck yourself though well then that's the pointless question because
you can't even you can't even choose that option
yeah i guess by the process of elimination i fuck myself
yeah i guess i guess i gotta and um i'll just marry rags and we'll do infinite
episodes of efap and i guess i'll kill wolf um wolf dies
you can we're gonna we're gonna go and we'll just invent a resurrection
machine all of our money and disappear into the mediterranean and disappear off
the face of the planet never be seen or heard from again
probably each just fuck ourselves we can always um
stream the efap from the mediterranean i don't know yeah
stream us fucking ourselves oh yes uh which is stronger tism or the force
well tism changes based on the person i guess the force does too yeah
well yeah you know uh highest concentrations of the force versus
the tism i'm pretty sure tism wins i have to check with my scientists
uh how are you strong though i've seen so we've seen some mighty tism
yeah and it really does challenge your understanding of like
reality that's that that's strong
uh
are you beautiful doggo rag hello rags dominate arch and convince him
mauler is v
oh i would i don't oh they're so oh man i don't have the skill i don't have like
i don't actually physically i don't have dominant
as a discipline why would you want to convince him he's
i'm v yeah why would you do that that's the other problem i don't have
that that necessary discipline unlocked but also why
um i still have free super chat so i don't know if you talked about mandalorian
but i thought it wasn't good too much bad in a super chat
uh i think it's good i do think it's mostly good yeah but not perfect until i
see the full season i can't really be more definitive because
i don't know where it's gonna go what it's gonna do but i'll be interested to
see what happens
um my grandma passed away recently and my dad and i have to take care of stuff
i'm so lucky you guys were streaming today to bring a smile to my face
yeah sorry to hear it man and um hopefully you can have some fun with
these streams also muesli i think you will
uh you chose the objectively hardest hex girl in my opinion
well i mean it looks like most people choose it well
yeah probably not the best you know i wanted to give you some money but didn't
know what to say so i settled on this all right
hey mauler since jay brought it up last efap i spruced up the giant playlist
look at mauler streams and look at info if you're still curious
i mean i don't mind someone making a playlist of like all streams that
jay or i or rags have appeared on like that's fine it's just a lot of them are
unlisted just because i don't want them uh active on my channel and i don't
know where else to release uh put them director said no sequel
director said no sequel oh about joker we shall see
i wouldn't call it too early uh yeah i mean i would
if they've if they gotta make one well no i'm saying like uh irrelevant
whether or not we think they should i'm just saying like if they've announced
the director that he's not doing i'd be like that thing made a billion dollars
like pretty sure they're gonna be interested in getting a sequel out of
him and if he refuses who knows what's gonna happen then
then what they'll do is they'll pick a new director yeah i was gonna say like
the the the sequel film will probably make its money back
uh even if it's terrible but they're probably going to be interested in doing
it but uh yeah well because the um what they'll do
is they'll because most normies who go and see this stuff they don't care who
the director is they just go by movie title
so like oh direct oh joker two joker one was great
they'll we'll just get that again you know
can you say he's open to it i think uh walking phoenix said he's open to it
yeah that's what i heard yeah uh oh you sexy beaches loves you how's life
pretty good pretty good life's going pretty good yeah
even busy doing all that good stuff and work done
having some fun all the good stuff uh before i go back to work if any of you
could be an avenger what avenger would you be
and what is your team name not efap also hyrax
hello i'd probably go with one of the super op ones
like unironically captain marvel maybe captain marvel
um or thor pretty cool to be thor but um the
because you know like the idea that you're like oh what about iron man it's
like well you don't need to be iron man to get the iron man suit so
while you kind of need to be thor to get thor
yeah and also if you're iron man then you have to
like the infrastructure and the business and like iron man's probably
like busy all the time every day ptsd which would be tough to deal with
yeah so and we're talking strictly powers i feel like
some of them there there is maintenance and upkeep when it comes to the quote
unquote powers of uh iron man so that would be work legit
work so probably yeah some op like captain marvel
something like that scarlet witch maybe or and the team name
would probably be tism and i would make it stand for something significant
titan of titans of intergalactic space magic
there you go yeah tism we'll put in our spaceship
um i'm about to start with my snow shift but before i go when's your next
video coming out rags um i'll be doing dog bite stuff for a
while until i'm finished up with um finished up with this main channel
video
there you go and uh you've already said before it'll it'll be yeah it's just
it's gonna be really long it's gonna be really long
one episode uh the first episode you missed my super chat
from april 9th 2018 please read it that's creepy shiv you fuck it
would be it i know you are i don't even know if i could access the
ones from april 9th 2018 with the way youtube stupid system works
but uh yes i i surely will uh peanut butter mayonnaise and banana
sandwich yes or no
uh no i'm gonna say no for me there's too many different things at once
that's that is a no gonna freak out my tongue
and i'll have to calm him down so he can't be doing that
um how many monitors do you all use and what res
i have three monitors uh they're all 1440p
it's just a wonder of it's just a matter of as years go by
you start with your one and then your cheapos
and then you get a new monitor replace it and then you just
if you either if you don't sell it it becomes a secondary monitor and then
eventually they just uh kind of match i started out with um
well console gaming so i had a tv it was a it was a relatively nice tv for
for the the time i brought in and then when i first got the first pc
and a monitor the tv became the second monitor that i
switched out for the console whenever i wanted it
then i bought the next pc and that primary monitor became my secondary
monitor and the tv died i had two standard 1080p monitors
and then we fast forward to now and i have
those two monitors my left and right or the center one is a
2k monitor i guess shorthand which uh holy shit
so upper resolutions on monitors i didn't realize how amazing i can get in
terms of use like so much detail and space
it's just like whoa um but yeah three more yeah
like it's like having the way describes people is like it's like having a bigger
desk yeah uh it's kind of weird because i didn't
expect it to be this useful and it's super useful
oh so useful and for working i honestly my perfect setup might even be
four monitors at this point because i end up getting a lot of stuff that's like
mainstay on all monitors so like discord and um
youtube sit on the left and right and so the center then becomes the
editing software or the video game or the um like obs sits on the right when
i'm using it but yeah it's um invaluable when you're uh working
as an internet job to have more than one monitor i die if i have a one
one monitor system anymore i can't see anything help
oh like rag said it's pretty cool because as long as you hang on to those
old monitors they can eventually stack up and become useful secondary ones
oh yeah uh you just like i've got three and some people do more
yeah the monitor on my left is i've had this one now for i think seven or eight
years yeah and you could buy just if it's not
your main monitor that you're like playing games and stuff on you can just
buy cheapo ones that are just much enough to match the rest and
boom it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a simple monitor but
oh yeah i'm i'm really glad really really glad i got him
uh it then it becomes like a space issue like i don't have any room for
more
okay more left right it's pronounced as startes
oh i've been saying estatus
i don't know if that's right or wrong i'm going to trust this man estatis
estartis is fine if i remember to pronounce it that way though i might
not uh ray actually is better than any lord
of the rings character you don't believe that and i know so
no one would believe that
uh rc not a porn series massive realistic war series books went into
depth on the moral ambiguity of using slave clone troopers
uh jedi bad for using them
okay sure that's definitely a potential aspect of
that you know it's not explored in the movies it's just
a given and you don't really think about it but yeah i could definitely see how
that would be a moral issue
would have been cool to explore in the main movies oh well
no just how many times can diabeto vote i'm gonna go ahead and assume
numbers don't go that clearly
um and he votes for himself
rights of self-ed uh not my proudest fap oh only proud faps on efap there's no
such thing as a shameful fap no matter what
um i don't know man just keep it to yourself
don't tell it you'll be fine
gay j nigdius creamy nut spunk oh my goodness
creamy nut spunk oh my goodness uh creamy she said i'm giving out n-word
passes in the chat does anyone want one um that was like a few days ago though
so i don't know if he's still giving them out i hope the offer is still good
or he got some spares uh death to the MPLA MPLA is the big gay
what's the MPLA um
let me see uh the people's movement for the liberation of angola
unless i have no idea about angolan well i don't know i don't know anything
about politics so i'm gonna have to say that i
don't know who i'm with yeah i don't think about it but okay
um i've had some time to sleep and you're still going
yep we have that effect on uh a bunch of people
oh no they know how to defeat the bts insulin
yeah did it happen in the storyline free hong kong eppstein didn't kill himself
hi rags hello dear rags what will be the next rags reviews be
hmm uh probably i'll probably finish up um
i'll probably do fallen order next i'll probably play that a bit more
um that or modern warfare i'd like to finish it i just need to finish it i
need to um because i've got all my footage and
everything ready i just need to do it but i think i've got my thoughts
together for it i got enough footage and everything
tell me quick in that a jab in the head
don't know what to make another jab in the head
tell me quick in that a jab in the head
tell me oh wait is it lyrics is that supposed to be like lyrics yeah
what's the song hey uh the smash mouth um
ain't the jab in the head or something
i can't believe uh all-star by smash mouth but like what part
i don't know oh ain't that a kick in the head
ain't that it no no like instead of ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
is like something something jab in the head or that's that's probably it
i'm following i'm following this is a show about internet wizards intended for
incels ret do nagons very true wonder how game of
thrones would have ended if spyro was in it
um i think he would have been morally against what happened in westeros
game of thrones i don't know i don't know i don't know much about
spyro's i don't know much about his spiros
yeah his moral system and his code and all that
maula didn't you try and kiss monday matt once i
don't remember this event um i'm gonna go ahead and deny it
until further evidence is brought forth
no that was cinema roberto okay rags i don't think i can eat that much
me wanna bet
anyone else get a wholesome vibe of hanging with a group of good friends and
laughing about movies or watching efap efap feels like a family
the heart oh
you can definitely laugh with us good good good friends in chat of course
post posting the smiley faces and happy things there's never any negativity here
okay we would never attack someone's opinion
it's disgusting from creamy nasty of us from creamy see the from creamy sheave
super chat seen from lilo and stitch lilo and stitch
uh efap means family
didn't telsie gabbard say ohana doesn't mean family she said it means something
else more specific like uh uh i hope
you have like good times to you or something like that i can't remember but
i just find it funny because i was like oh my god
lilo and stitch lie does it hurt that's a fucking super chat
huh live efap and efap meet up when could be chaotic
not out of the cards forever i mean i don't know how a live efap would work
we would we cover a video oh man i don't even know
it'd be maybe it'd be like uh i i don't i don't know i have no idea
maybe we could just have topics something maybe yeah we can come across a
bunch of topics we'd prepare get stuff lined up
i hope anna heard reacted to some of ra's chats
i think she did she came oh yeah she came back on like some awkward stuff
when when she came back from the last one um
just had a person try to tell me that the new star wars were good because ray
was strong with no explanation did they really argue that that's a plus
all right whatever floats your boat as they say
um here's all my money long man missed most of those
streams so i'm looking forward to hearing bob's terrible take later today
hi rags hello and yeah it'll be out very soon within
12 hours ish i think hopefully i was right flight from norway to india is
shorter oh i think they were saying that the
stream would still be going by the time they were landing i think
um rags have you slept with hairy butt women
um no no not really sometimes around the uh front a bit but no not really
most women take care of themselves to at least that degree
i don't though i'm i'm pretty natural looking right now
just wanted to say please watch mr robot unreliable narrator inspired
cinematography ralph the movie maker did an excellent
review of it uh fringy advocates for that a lot so
yeah like apparently it's pretty i just watched the crown season three
and now i understand why we shot our sa family in a damp cellar in the middle of
nowhere do brits love royalty i don't think
you'll find many people in britain who say they love royalty
yeah i i guess it's just like a historical thing like a british
tradition in a way yeah but if you ask any citizen what
does the queen do they probably like um i don't know she waves
you know yeah she waves carry over tradition i suppose
bob can't say shit because you were talking about scooby
yeah if he said there's people waiting hours long think about we'll be like nope
scooby doe
uh first super chat going to bed but i'll catch this on moolah hi mauler and
massive guest rags hello hello just came to add my snake milk
to the stream goodbye and don bless thank you very
much or viper milk i guess you could say that was
uh what's everyone's star wars tier list from best to worst you may decide to
include disney's fan fiction films or not in the list
so mine from best to worst goes empire a new hope return of the jedi
then probably episode three
then rogue one
then we're into murky territory
for all phantom menace and attack of the clones i do
uh rate above tlj and force awakens yeah rise of skywalker is probably going
to be the fucking dead last with the way those leaks went if
if you have the leaks or anything to go by then
oh boy yeah i think that pretty much answered the question
yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be the worst that the leaks are
an accurate representation of what's actually
they it will be the worst it will be the worst
um do you have a different list or do you want to carry on
um like what my list would be of worst to
our best to worst yeah hmm yeah let's see empire a new hope
and then are we just talking the mainline episodes
yeah and they said you can include disney on if you want to or not and it
did it seems to be just like what you like the most
yeah i guess empire's first new hope is second
then episode six then episode three then
one then two then the force awakens then the last jedi
and then i'm gonna yeah i was gonna say you're gonna
would you include rogue one and would it be above one and two
um yeah i put rogue one above no yeah i would put rogue one above one and two
um i would put solo as between the prequels and the sequels
mm-hmm i think that's fair and assuming episode nine is like it is in
the leaks then it is at the very fucking bottom
how exciting that'll be um very bottom re diabetus getting his powers in the
deep fryer incident did he gain orphan powers
oh yeah because apparently his parents died in a deep fryer accident
it depends on how old diabeto was in that moment whether or not he owned his
own blood i believe that is our law we haven't
decided on exactly what age you own your own blood i don't know if we're
going to go with like 18
21 i i don't know complicated
diabeto i was in the camps his uncle it was fat camp
diabeto i was almost put in a gas chamber uncle it was a sauna
diabeto get off my case okay yeah diabeto is very overly dramatic
undeniably it's rewind time gotta watch from the start
have this for the long man thank you very much
just woke up still going on good missed my train to work
bad waiting with you great ps hello from france by a frenchman
this is my first super chat so take this much for all of your pps
oh no sorry for all of you and then pps uh
also at high rags how would you feel if i named my dog
if you named oh that'd be really great that would be quite an honor
that would be really amazing if someone did that i think that's a very uh
that's a very nifty thing to do if you do it it's got some state of power
it's a good it's a good name it's a good name for a dog i was gonna say if
you do it uh you should totally get like a little
caller and show and send a picture and oh yeah that would be amazing
yeah i'd love to see that um please don't make fun of hitler oh
i mean you know we're just having fun with hitler it's fine
um excuse me what did that backwards teacher say
uh if you're oh no it wouldn't be referring to the professor
um i'm not 100 sure i'm afraid i'm not sure which one we're referring to
uh finally super chat's available in latvia
thank you for hours of objectively good entertainment also high rags
hello yeah cool what's the difference between a chickpea and a cabbage
i've never paid to have a cabbage on my face
i like that that's good hey guys this is my first super chat you guys are awesome
keep it up p.s high rags hello thank you very much and yes
hello rags your subscribe star discord link doesn't work
super glad you have a subscribe star so i can support you now though it doesn't
oh thanks thanks yeah um i really i do appreciate that i figured there'd be
some who don't want to you know use patreon
um what i'll do tomorrow then is i will put a new link up there
i guess it either timed out or i something i don't know maybe
i don't know maybe i set the wrong options for it but i will replace that
link tomorrow um but yeah if you if you do want to
support but you don't like patreon then i do have a subscribe star as well
yeah it's a good alternative um you're gonna give people that option you
know advice on where to find movie clips for videos
youtube be surprised on just how much of movies are uploaded to youtube and the
way it works is that people upload clips and then
the original copyright holders monetize them
so they get the money but the clips are available for download and reusable
as long as you stick to the copyright limits you can actually uh use it that
way
kick j thinking of a funny super chat message is hard
also high rags hello special program to record and edit for videos
oh i use vegas 15 um yeah other than that uh maybe some nifty
stuff to have would be light shot to get really quick
screenshots um i use shadow play to capture video
footage from the screens um
that's really have it's pretty much the three stuff the three bits that i use
i mean like i have itunes you have an account
yeah i'm pretty much the same uh i use audacity to record though
and it's because i really like the noise reduction feature and
vegas has one that you can do but it involves like
downloading an uh extension that's like a part of
audacity in the first place so i just i just don't bother with that portion i'm
just like yeah but noise reduction on audacity is
blows me away every time with how good it can be
um ray is an orphan explains everything well explains her villainous
nature but her power you know i don't see how it explains that
um i went to sleep and woke up and you're still going
it's funny though that's from the previous stream still
um i want a star wars that's just palpatine the best character i don't
even care what he does i mean it would be cool if it was done
right to have a star wars film all about him
personally but i don't know i don't think it would be good
yeah it was like we're at the point now where i just don't want disney to do
anything with star wars stay away basically
which star wars characters would you like to talk with
impregnate and remove from the universe talk with impregnate remove from the
universe um like current current star wars
timeline quote unquote or is it just i think you probably choose from whoever
you want from wherever you want in the star wars
saga so when it comes to remove
i'm gonna say like it would be like ray yeah probably ray because rose tico
doesn't have as much of a damaging effect in this world yeah
yeah probably probably ray um
talk with luke possibly maybe yoda yeah i'd probably talk with luke
talk with i mean you tell i mean hon he's probably seen all kinds of stuff
yeah um
something yeah something like that so what about impregnate
impregnate probably
huh probably be either
well what's weird is that you have to because
if you impregnate someone then you know you should
you know be you know be with them and all that and you want the best for your
kid so you have i i mean you have padme right
she's pretty good looking she's a queen you know so the kid will have a very
she just dies of sadness sometimes you gotta be careful
yeah but like the kid would be raised as like a prince essentially of a planet
you're like damn it would be in the empire rule though
so just be careful well you would still prob well even then
you would still probably have it probably still be really good for him
because he would be it probably is a system where you have
each planet had like a planetary governor of a sort
you know so she they'd still definitely would do well for themselves
and Naboo's really quiet and they i don't know what they'd ever really do
with Naboo it would probably be imperial controlled in
like name but in execution probably nothing would go on there
uh because it's just out of the way either that or
i mean i'm trying to think of anyone new but it's just like
uh well and then if you go with you know leah of course then you know she's a
princess too but she becomes a very high rank
what do you think because you have to know that 30-year gap between these
movies you're like well i assume that she'd
she'd be a politician and she would be a galactic war hero and stuff like that
and so now it'd be a very illustrious you know kind of you know title if you
had a kid being raised under that and they'd
they'd do well for themselves so i don't know probably one or two i don't know
probably pad somebody suggested impregnating
holdo oh no no i don't want to impregnate old
ass laura dern oldo oldo yeah no i think pat made a strong
choice someone said aunt buru nah if i could i
mean i'm sure she's really nice but i wouldn't
i don't know if i'd want my my child being uh
if i could choose between yeah eventual king of a planet or poor moisture
farmer on tatooine one would probably way safer than the
other two so true
also i guess this person included their own choices it was
talk with luke or yoda impregnate a soca or a yala and remove ray from the
universe i don't i'm not familiar with a lot of the
so good i know i don't know a yala though
let me take a look uh star wars uh yeah
uh oh she's the blue she's the blue uh
uh ayala secura oh i think that's pronounced ayla secura
uh ayla secura yeah they've um i guess they spelt it a little bit weird on
the super chat yeah no she's uh she's she's neat
yeah
um she had a brutal death in episode three
she got shot she did several times they kept doing it too
make time yeah they want to make sure they confirm that kill
look at it like rad the pictures one of this one showed up it's just like uh oh
get it too close to uh safety there
i like how they got layers fucking bikini oh
wait this can't actually be part of the show no i don't think so
okay yeah that's that's weird it would be weird
it would be this might sound weird but this seems
more scummy than if they were just naked
uh how would you argue that well this is like it it
it's almost like it's being the the other one you'd be like yeah it's just
porn and you look at it's very important but this is like
it clearly like it's straddle like it's straddling that line like it wants to be
clean it wants to be safe for work but you
know the intentions beneath it it's almost like you're trying to hide that
it's supposed to be like titillating in this weird way and it knows it's just
uh wait does apoban do sound effects too
wait uh i don't know i think i might reference something we were talking
about but i have completely forgotten at this point
pop in briefly to leave a super chat come back like nine hours later and the
first thing i hear is my super chat lovey long men and women never change
steamboat in captain marvel to worry riot
oh steamboat that was that was something steamboat oh my goodness
uh planks captain marvel did have steamboat nick fury
oh nick fury's the steamboat of captain marvel i understand
oh of this marvel cinematic universe we have to marvel
at least in captain marvel's film yeah oh lordy cap marvel
oh hashtag justice for steamboat hello efap 62 cast kick jay he's not even
here he's been kicked yeah he kicked himself
um to be fair rod wait to be fair rod doesn't have a roof big enough
the movie bob i think a couple people have said that they're concerned that
you'll bounce away as well you know i don't think there's a roof that
can support him like the idea he's climbing up in the
roof the house is going down i'm sorry he's got to stay on the ground floor
like raw sure he's he's got the the backing of the egyptian
you know infrastructural systems to create this very high roof
but will that be like if they can build a pyramid surely they can build a ramp
strong enough to be able to roll up movie bobs slowly but surely that's a
big question big question oh uh efap best girl anna j longboat
maulers crush aden or rags
i'm pretty sure it's rags as what now efap's best girl of course i'm the
best girl got that boy pussy uh steamboat
unbridled praise when you imagine praise
uh that feeling when jl should be here because steamboat is here
exists and starts laughing i'm curious what a reaction would be
oh j longboat's reaction to steamboat could you imagine
she would laugh if fucking asshole hey j check out this new cool fun new
character started streaming 11 hours ago
mauler feels yeah i know it's funny because if it says 11 hours ago that
you know that it's only going to be 40 minutes more so
you're like oh no uh how many streams could you say that about
ron needs to upgrade to lava since his roof can't fit movie bob
yeah we did talk about that uh throwing him off into lava
but the thing is that implies then that ron might be in a dangerous place
and you know last thing we need is to melt our roof thrower like we can't do
that
good day to you good day to you hello ras manna is volcano adjacent he is
a god volcano adjacent all right i'm not gonna
deny it that sounds pretty neat uh wow i woke up and you're still going
yes i've got some free super chats here's one
thank you yay uh you could count movie bob's
chromosomes on 33 pairs of hands
i think i get it that's a lot a lot of hands that is a lot oh my goodness
um as a person with mental issues i had to walk out and take a breather at one
point i still like the movie but got real for me
love y'all hi rags hello hello yeah and yeah that's fair enough
um it does see it's pretty raw that film it's not uh pulling any punches
oh i'm late to the party and it'll be sunday when you read this but thursday
was also my birthday so that's at least four birthdays today
fully sure we did an efap when there's four birthdays
that's the birthday efap
um slept at the start of the stream woke up and it's still going we'll be sure
to watch the vod and draw up any new memes that come from this efap
uh we'll appreciate it thanks stuff it's good yeah
it's this nikos the one that makes the the cute stuff
well the cute stuff that isn't pikachu stuff
oh okay i gotcha i gotcha i gotcha uh went to sleep five hours into efap just
woke up two months ago i would have been surprised you're still going but now it
seems to be the norm also hi rags hello please stop doing 12 hour
streams twice a week i beg you i have a life this wasn't this never the intention
we stopped at six and a half today or seven i think
wait where did we stop where did we get to super chat today was it five and a
half hours six and a half i can't remember wait
it was something like that it was a long i was about to say we can test from
when we uh shad left but that doesn't make sense
because he stayed for a good uh good while actually so
i don't know exactly anyway um i'd expect ryan johnson to be a great
modern twist of the knife also hi rags hello kick j and high all my n words
it's sunday when you hear this actually no it's monday for me right now
and i think it's monday for you as well isn't it rags

that didn't take a while well
ready uh yeah we did it we did not over though
it's not over that love you rags mauler why thank you
jabo said he might want to make a video defending ray there's something to be
said about boulder boy attempting a sis sisyphean task um
yeah you're not getting into it of course it would be him to
try he's got to be like a contrarian yeah i think that's a new angle to try and
take the he's looking for the hot take the one
that he gets right that's against the grain
but it's not gonna happen for a long time i don't think
um stop talking about my wife yes that's a good reference hello
hello take youtube's money thank you youtube i guess great timing thank
god and dawn you guys started now you'll still be streaming by the time i
get off work it's very probable yeah it actually will
it's safer to say that than not these days
it's shad man wait yeah it's the it's the other shad
the better shad what's up guys i'm loving the amount of efaps we've been
getting lately bless the dawn yep uh the intention is to now actually
have the week break as per usual because there was two two
week breaks you see and you can't have too many of them
acceptable you said two two i did hello my australian n words
yeah that's applicable do you believe space is real
i do actually i believe space is real yeah i'm convinced
i'm gonna take that position i know it's controversial
but i'm one of them pro-spacists and not only believe it's real but i think
space is neat we should uh we should make friends with
it or something um my 20th birthday is tomorrow it's
great to get to listen to my favorite jebbs for the last few hours of my
teenage hood all hail the dawn i'll hail the dawn
j free Epstein didn't kick himself
hello shadowversity any software you reckon i'm gonna
save that mr shad
last efap three hours four minutes and 48 seconds
mauler on movie bob this is where his big climax is gonna be
obi-wan i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices
suddenly cried out in terror that would be what would happen
that's what he does he makes voices cry out in terror
beware the false ra and his olive green visage
i was assuming that ra takes multiple accounts in case he gets like temp banned
for saying naughty things or something i assumed that's what it was i can't
imagine that whatever happened no fuck a doodle do my brethren hello to
you too hello mauler streams for 30 hours a week
and doesn't know how to kick j higher eggs hello i'm gonna look
into whatever the hell's going on with the way it now works with streaming the
only thing i'm confused about is letting me set the thumbnail
uh before i start streaming it seems to only let me do it once i've started
which is annoying but i can get used to it
throw shad off the continent with a light stone and a dark stone
why would we do that
you can stay on australia we're not using it it's fine
yeah i'm sure it's a fine place hello me and my friend genesis of androzani
did a fan-made spin-off of efap called edar
where we covered two dr who video essays of pure tism thank you guys for
being great inspirations may the dog be with you
no absolutely i'm really glad that you guys decided to you know
start a podcast and start talking about stuff that's really good to hear
go for it i'm glad you did i hope you pause a plenty
and uh yeah dr who video essays i don't think we
funnily enough we technically covered a bit of one
i think it was vox that mentioned dr who maybe i can't remember but yeah
not really covered dr who jay is our resident dr who nerd
your pauses be many in your frames be elotism
uh jay if you want oh the stone thing's apparently a reference to shad's book
that makes sense uh jay if you want to friend me on facebook i have screenshots
of brooks tweets after all i am a supporter of efap
um i think he made a thread on twitter if you can just send him to him
through there um probably work out for him i'm not
sure what he wants to do with him yeah i mean
might be good to keep it handy in case he ever needs some more nobs tism
oh yes i've had stream overload so i can't stay
long but i've enjoyed the last efap mini i was actually taking notes from the
vids commentary on filmmaking well uh yeah like we we tried to get into a
lot of discussions just about options you have as a filmmaker compared to what
chris apparently went with um it wasn't like malicious that video i
know a lot of people might interpret it as that but i mean i think if he had
made something pretty good we would have been talking about how good it was
in terms of like achieving in certain crafts and stuff
um it's just the writing was so distracting
it was really tough to like break into talking about some of the great stuff
in there and the cutaways to those movies
and like oh i saw people on the comment section being like oh it reminds me of
channel awesome nostalgia critics skits and i was like oh
ah yeah yeah it did even i got that kind of vibe from them
um any thoughts on pokemon sword and shield
i have not played it and i just know that people are angry about it
whereas i'm aware fighting over some stuff i've heard that they frustrated
that not enough of the pokemon are in it
and that the graphics are terrible but i've also seen that a lot of people are
pissed at those arguments sort of thing but yeah i'm not really into the uh
discussion i don't know much about it yeah i don't know enough about pokemon
or especially this game in particular i just
don't know not my area
um what do you think are the three best objective animated movies of this decade
i'd say they're the lego movie into the spider verse and inside out
um if that includes stop motion i would consider kubo and the two strings
that film was extremely good but i might be biased because the stop
motion was just amazing i really like the lego movie i haven't
seen it but i've only heard good things about it
uh but thinking about animated stuff what about uh
what about coco
i mean i thought coco was all right i don't i don't i've already forgotten a
lot of it i thought it was fine um i'd have to think about animated
movies um the last 10 years i wonder if that
includes like up i can't remember when that came out
um let's see
uh let's see a spider man into the spider this is very good we still
need to watch that
let's see tangled i really liked that was 2010
i liked fantastic mr fox up his 2009 ratatouille's out of the he's out it's
out of the uh out of the running i mean wallie is out of the running as
well yeah 2008 up is 09
ratatouille's seven
um what about big hero 6 did you like that i didn't see it
oh i liked it i saw it it's not like great great great but i liked it fair
amount i liked wreck it ralph uh oh yeah that
was good yeah but man i'd say stuff like tangled
and everything like that i don't know if i make it best best
yeah there'd be a there'd be a lot to go through but um there's some good
choices we've been over here yeah um i ship sexy i ship sexy sonic
yeah uh i ship sexy tiger j with mauler the
human gas mask okay
hello there rags frog man hipster shad and mauler
i guess hipster hello hey yes hello i j appreciate that i'm just
certain of it the long man grows more powerful with
each passing moment by the will of the dawn his power will
encompass all that is all that was and all that will ever be
as the spider's prophecy foretold neat as the spiders
thank you all for the delightful content um glad you're enjoying it good stuff
mr shad if people are to buy your book should they get the hardcover
or uh as a sword like weapon this also ends with high rag like weapon
hello i'm gonna keep that for mr shad
uh shad what's your opinion on fallout shish kebab
i shall keep we're gonna have a lot of shad questions i imagine
you got past like eight of them when he came on and i was gonna be like another
15 or something hi rags
hello hi shad please cover trope talk on efap it's a bit of a tism
um i don't know anything about trope talk i don't
think but i mean if there's a particular episode i should be made aware of or
something i don't know um also please support the koalas i
hear they're in a rough spot yeah fricking just tell me about that
sounds terrible if they're actually bordering on extinction thanks to this
forest fire that's crazy
um that's another shad question how does it
oh that's another shad question the um acme
nukem sword oh i guess because in reference to the
nuke sword we brought up
yeah the nuke sword oh sorry there was an extra part to a question i'd asked
you and it's kind of amusing thing like the question is i see in my notes
you were asked a question and then it ended with also what's your stats on
koreans
my stance on koreans yeah that's how the question ended
yeah that's they're fine i guess all right
uh nuke sword a sword with a nuke for a pommel
i mean yeah we got a visual representation of such a sword nuke
sword a sword like nuke mm-hmm
could you guys watch and react to the pilot of has been hotel on youtube i'd
like to see an efap minion you guys's thoughts on it
uh i mean it's not impossible i just don't really know anything about it
so a couple people have been referencing it the has been hotel thing
um get blue bullet barry and top hats in here for a four horseman of the pc
pocalypse reunion yes i've been around long enough to
remember that show oh yeah it was it was it was it was it was
i don't know if it was meant to be a regular thing but now maybe sometime
i don't know don't don't hold your breath but maybe maybe some time
uh hi molar rags wolf and honored guests been through all the old efaps on 15
currently thanks for all the laughs love you all
hope you're enjoying them very much that's some history right there liking
them let's go back what are we as soon as we
get that other episode out we'll be up to 63 episodes of efap
i'm a long way and by normal podcast standards we're probably past 100 at
this point in terms of like one to two hour shows if you know what
i mean actually i could probably find out
efap dot me
if the count is currently up to 17 days and 11 hours
17 times
four
plus 11 i'll divide by i'm gonna be generous two
hour podcasts so rags uh this is just a rough estimate
but apparently we would be on episode 210 by normal podcast standards
210 how long for a normal podcast i did it by two hours
yeah well hmm well we are we're certainly not normal no
terrifyingly unnormal we're freaks also the um
the decorations on the efap dot me website
got like a little christmas tree with all different guests on it and the
presence of meme references and it just has
jeb stop here as if like for Santa
wonderful little details i also love the graph it just has the fucking 50th
episode of the 29 hour spike
that was something and funnily enough we're almost past the halfway point of
getting to it again well i say that 75 not too far away from
halfway to episode 100
um wow this is certainly slowly but surely one thing at a time
edging our way closer you have to do some prep for that imagine that there
needs to be something special happening in an episode was 100
i don't believe it's already been you know this long since 50
yeah time flies uh wow this is still going also hi
wags hello wait i am oh there we go sorry i
actually read that one out before i ran onto the wrong page
hello mule shire um all right now my fourth movie heat thoughts
don't know if they mean their fourth favorite movie
but it would make sense because heat's pretty good from what i remember anyway
um have you seen heat rags robert deniro i've
no i haven't seen it no wait al Pacino's in it it might not be robert deniro
let me check
yeah i'm not crazy okay sorry for a second i thought i'd imagine doing the
film um also Jeb Nicholson do you guys think
that she thinks you nick her in the butt
also hi rags hello i'm not sure how to interpret that
question nick her in the butt nick yeah well
k i n uh k i think it was can i k i i don't know what that means
oh sorry k i k n i c k nick her in the butt
i have no idea what that means i do not either
k and i ck yes
uh i don't know uh i don't know i have no idea what that means
all right um oh shit first time catching live hi rags
hey hello geode that's fair you guys geode you guys make batwoman
enjoyable hey we do what we can just trying to make
the world a better place hard to believe some people watch it
unironically and seriously for entertainment purposes because i think
it's good there is a fan base that's insane and
apparently like i was you know just reading the the discussions on it they
think it's the best of the cw shows right now so
what does that say the others must be abysmal could you imagine like
um but yeah you know thank you i'm glad you're enjoying it
it's it's a disaster but yes um it is a disaster but it's our disaster
together shad if lightsabers existed they'd be instant person exploding
me shad you're doing a bad job of not selling his weapon to me
um the thing about uh exploding people if it gets i mean because
lightsabers get put up right up to people's faces and um
yeah i don't think yeah i don't know about it's making people explode i
don't know about that i guess um you have to look at like
some crazy in-house logic maybe about how because
you know a lot of people make the joke about what makes a lightsaber stop
growing like you shouldn't just go on like what how does it know to be
a sword length stuff like that i don't know how yeah how does it stop
you know at what point does it you know how does it make the beam stop that sort
of thing i don't know i just assume that they
know a way they can do away i don't know
uh warhammer 40k is the only way forward brothers
all right i'm okay with it pretty neat hello shad hello
i i just came on about lightsaber exploding weapons
well i've actually got a couple of questions ready for you as well
oh sweet i might still be a minute or two just while kids settle down you'll
probably hear them in the background okay but just a note on the lightsaber
thing the problem is is the shrapnel you explode someone and they explode
into you and most likely kill you too they're dangerous weapons is your point
yes yes yes they're they're very dangerous
weapons um bastards are so uncivilized
yeah if they functioned uh keep going with the regular
super chats i'll be ready in a couple of minutes all right good stuff
but i'll be listening and just meet myself so the grandmothers won't be too
bad um light sabers can't melt steel
steel beams i mean yeah you know it's why gone put it in there it definitely
melted those flattened out door style beams so
undeniable truth uh rags we will be pooping together soon
crotch to crotch eye to eye i wipe yours you wipe mine with the door open
meet my demands and it stops no that is nasty
i will not acquiesce to your disgusting uh we have we i i don't know
chad when you're alone in your house do you poop with the door open
you know i like to it's like no one else is there so
he's supposed to get out of support i mean it's the fittest rags the guys the
guys talking about with people being there so like
he's he's a way more than we had been no i'm
like i i can't i always close it always close it
i don't know even when it's just me right i always close it
yeah i don't i've never thought about it yeah i don't really care i don't think
about uh whether or not if i know there's no one in the house
i don't think i could give a shit well i guess i give a shit technically
um just on the note about the uh the qui-gon
melting through that door that was also a blast door which is supposed to be like
very resistant uh you know laser fire and all that stuff and we would expect
to actually be far more resistant than regular steel beams so i'm just
just just adding that in there as well i was always curious how it works when
that happens because like the light comes from the handle right
like it's coming out does it get stopped or does it just go
straight like i'm assuming it's like as almost as
if it's like a flame like a laser but really long like yeah
it's supposed to be it's supposed to be plasma contained in
a in a force field and and that protects the hands from the
intense heat but it but if you touch anything that's
basically something crossing the force field to be exposed to the plasma
and that's when the heat you know exchange and damage is dealt and things
and so that's why it would also cause the instant
explosion because it's that the heat would still transfer once you touch
someone so they wouldn't have protection from the
force field
yay it's live remember to read shad his super chats i did
high rags and kick jar jar the jet plane are you looking forward to the
king'sman prequel next year i don't care no okay i hope people who
want it to be good end up getting what they want but i
don't really care i signed out after the first one
like i like the first one i mean the second one kind of annoyed me a lot
um jenny is so angered by efap and you drink her tears may her hatred of joker
be her undoing oh she'll be fine um joker was just another
interesting sort of um it's kind of like tlj just a different
made people really want to argue for why it was bad but they came up with a lot
of really weird reasoning and she was just one of them
she'll be fine though um
oh the guy wanted to clarify rags that on the toilet it would be groin to groin
i i can't remember if i read that out you just you just want to make sure you
got that so like the boys would be just
touching and rubbing up against each other while we uh
it's like the legs would prevent you from being able to do that while sitting
but what do i know be able to fit over the whole
i guess not with that attitude you got to just get one of them big thrones you
know i don't want to talk about it
so this person's strange don't entertain them
but they're strange i am a slave to reading out these messages i do my best
to filter just to add a question about the
whole jay thing because the last um super chat brought that up did has anyone
else like responded in a similar way where they like
um tweet out the stream that we you guys we have responded to before
like oh the jenny thing um yeah never like that i think we've had
instances of critters sort of vaguely recognizing that these things
have happened but um yeah but like full-on community white
night assault squad yeah it's never been anything like that
it was kind of hilarious these people yeah they gave us a lot of laughs
did seem rather disproportionate to the other people that
we have are reviewed and responded creators that do watch efap got annoyed
because they were like why are people saying it's sexist she's like one of the
three women they've ever covered that makes no sense at all
and obviously a lot of people just didn't know that they know a lot about
but it must have been bizarre to have been told how sexist and
in sally and ridiculous this show is like it's just
guys just talking about women and then being like wow
it's got a hundred thousand views like people are watching this
hey you know the demographics like what's the view at the average view rate
for um efap uploads and stuff i'm assuming it'll
be huge on moolah you mean or like on the second
channel like the average amount of views the podcast gets yeah
moolah yeah let's have a look yeah i mean after the after the tens of
thousands that it gets from just being live
the re uploads on moolah man they could be anywhere from
well yeah just the average view rate duration is what i'm interested in
oh duration so like how long they watch yeah how long people watch for
um yeah i can't look at it yet because i'm
in my other account and i don't want to swap them while i'm live streaming in
case something goes wrong um okay no yeah i'll have a look into it
that'll be interesting uh the average amount of time someone
spends watching efap
what would you guess that as rags i'd probably go with
four hours well i wonder if it if it if it counts any pauses
well because we we keep a pretty steady a pretty high number
pretty stable high number of watchers and then it just eventually it does of
course start to you know trail off but you know four
hours ish is kind of when that number starts to generally go down but it does
depend on what's covering who's there and what's going on
oh yeah and the fact that we're now on the
least like this is 2 a.m typically in most american countries and it's a
weird day so this is i'm surprised we've got 16 000 viewers
when nobody should really be around right
now this is like i'll be i'll be right back
give me just a second um another efap on a second
day for a fabulous day kaloo kalay okay excellent yes
shad i freaking loved your book thank you man that's awesome
hi that is pretty cool to hear like yeah you know we had a reference to it
earlier someone said to throw you off your continent with a light stone and a
dark stone i saw that one when it was posted i was
like oh that's a that's a book reference right there
that's when you know you've made it shad people are referencing your media
it's pretty cool i gotta admit it and the positive reviews are just
awesome i forget if you ever want pie yeah when you get positive reviews like
that on something you work so hard on that's pretty
yeah uh hi massives i'm on my way to see nick offerman the most interesting man
in the world would really love any feedback on my game
of thrones intro i tweeted you moves norms uh put a lot more work into it
game of thrones intro i'm uh you can always give a shot tweeting at me again
so i don't remember seeing anything like that
um a lot of things slip through the cracks for me
uh i don't remember seeing anything game of thrones intro
wise to perhaps oh there's some memes i think i've
missed on twitter actually if we have enough time i will do a bit
of a few memes at the end but i'm not sure we'll be able to read all of these
before we run out of the cap we might be able to we've gone at a pretty
pretty good pace um this time around i'm just cycling
quickly through twitter to see if i've missed anything
so
frozen two i don't even know oh
can't just give me this also yeah i'm still with you by the way
i'm just muting it when i'm not talking so the background noise
i'm with you for now but oh i've been up for
i've probably worked around six this morning yeah i've probably been up around
20 or so hours i won't be around this long you guys can only ask that you do
what you can what is this rags come on
oh my god this is an original work the guy who drew oh my god i thought that
might be original that's hilarious okay sorry i'm just uh
it is a nightmare for me i get like a bazillion notifications i just have to
scroll through and try and find the images mostly
um but i miss a lot as you as you're aware and people get upset and i'm like
i'm doing my best
sorry i'm using memes i will i will i will try multi to ask you um
hey mola when will you watch the meme videos i made two really good ones for
you it's not copyrighted but check if you want hope you guys like it
uh so i've got a backlog of them i'm still planning on doing um
uh stream um efap mini i'm gonna i'm gonna sort out i said i would
or the last stream but then i got um i had to turn up on two different like
creative related streams and then we got this one after this one i'm gonna have
some time to sort out i swear i'm gonna do it
we'll be able to hang around so i eagerly await the moola archive also for
fuck's sake it's not even december yet lay off the christmas theme also watch
jojo rabbit well i mean we're five days away from
december i think it's fair to be like preparing for it now other people gave
it to us that's true and it's amazing fan work
regardless of the christmas theme it's almost time to put up the christmas
tree in my household so
uh will you will you be doing a review of something good this year like an
episode of the boys also thanks for another great year
uh not even if i was intending to review something good this year i don't think
it'll be done by this year if you know what i mean
um who knows what 2020 will bring i do intend to talk
more on the main channel about good stuff
shad thoughts on the alacard versus trevor duel in the castlevania show
oh haven't seen it unfortunately can't comment as of yet
uh but i'll put it on the list so i'll give it a look
yeah rags has a suspicious amount of feminine curves
it's true spider oracle on don's leg oh yeah we did spot the spider oh yes
um check out a channel called white light in particular his video on dark
ciders too he does much the same thing you do with your videos mutually
you might like the guy and get him on here uh yeah
maybe i'll have to check it out here is my tithe brother j bolecki
j barat and send my love to wags the love has been sent send send your love
to me send me your love mauler i pressed the
button it's gone to you have you not gotten it
now let me check my you send it to my email
oh here it is yeah i got it it was in spam oh okay
cast google ah as the spiders foretold yes
shad any chance of a collab with arch warhammer focusing on 40k
fantasy fortresses or weapons well i've actually never heard of the guy
before um so don't i don't know as of yet uh
anything possible for the future but uh i'll try and check him out
there you go rags is friends with him it could be a set up there of some sort
yeah well not eventually yeah what what what's your uh what's your uh assessment
of his content rags oh he does warhammer stuff he um
does a political thing here and there but yeah i like him
smart guy cool yeah like really likes his war hammer
hi i i can appreciate having a passion
there you go um
uh noah wasn't an alcoholic he got drunk once in gen
oh yeah we uh you corrected that right wasn't noah it was um
yeah there was a lot yeah
may have gotten lost on myself a second
okay yeah that's fine um this picture shall be the centerpiece of the
inevitable efap museum oh yeah and ironically and it's not the
only one but that piece that we showed like i would totally get that printed in
high quality and frame it if i had like an efap room
it would totally go in there that shit was great
uh dear god i want this as a 4k desktop wallpaper please
yeah i don't i don't think i have a copy like a direct link to the original
the one i got is a link to a discord uh reimage but yeah guy who made that um
sir was what was it again sir nickelson i want to say sir
um but if you're watching this um email me
the originals if you want so i can uh if you'd like sorry and i can
well put them in places let's say um who doesn't love high res versions of
everything and yeah uh the email you can use if
in case that's the thing is attached to my about page on the uh
youtube channel the owl's name is bill bow
can't seem to remember what we saw i didn't know that
yeah ow um well that's from archangel i don't know if um
that's just it's booboo sorry booboo oh booboo okay
yeah very close
okay now i'm offended that ra is referenced here but not baowin
hashtag baowin deserves recognition um there might be some form of a dragon
reference on there um but also might not be the thing is
ra is um has evolved into a meme of his own you know
not necessarily because like if you had baowin then when you have to have like
all the artists and then uh i don't know if the artist
would include himself it starts getting complicated but ra is
is quite the meme special um alt right youtubers list breads i
have a card for that oh yeah what is the milk yield of space
rhinos compared to earthling rhinos or space manatees asking for a friend
i don't know i don't know isn't it two to one i heard i was two to one
i'm gonna go with shad on this i don't know enough about it i'm gonna defer to
the expert everything's the terrestrial rhinos
yeah i don't know would they need more milk if they lived in space they wouldn't
need as much energy to float around and stuff
or if they lived on planets they use the milk as a form of propulsion i heard
because they just shed mass to move they squeeze
their nips and they just yep that's how it works
that's what they should have thought of in tlj to get ahead of
you know being chased but no they just have a bunch of tontons strapped
to the back of their story i mean you know prove it doesn't work i
don't think you can time time shad i see you read invincible a
man of culture oh yes i got the anthologies in my in my
shelf right behind me and uh oh great stuff invincible really good
it's a comic book in case you guys are wondering by the way
i mean yeah it makes sense uh i wonder if the pits on tulsi gabbard's face are
deep enough to hold him oh my goodness a money shot wow
um isn't she considered like the most attractive
out of all the people there so yeah i'd say so
it's nice of you to think about giving her a donation
very kind yes
uh breath of the wild's weapon system is terrible you're welcome to try and
change my mind but it's still bad i know the main complaint is the weapons
break all the time right as part of the system they want them to like
enter a state of needing repair all the time and it forces you to play with all
of the weapons i know that that was a big complaint
but i haven't played it myself i don't know either heck out of me
i mean a weapon broke that bad like that often i'll go back to the maker and
demand my money back even like the best sword in the game
breaks and has to recharge whatever right awful
it's a travesty this money brought to you by youtube
thank you would you say uh what would you say is objectively a
great christmas special as well as your personal favorite i like jingle all the
way and it's sort of so bad it's good as do i but actually the strong
christmas movie i mean can i say die hard die hard
my mind went to like uh i guess a more traditional christmas one and i have to
say i kind of enjoyed elf al al yeah elf i
liked elf and as rags just said night before christmas
is a good shot for christmas the original santa claus with tim allen
that was a fun one never saw it i did but i can't remember how good it was or
not it's been a while since i watched it but
i have good memories um brooks not even smart enough to say
j equals himla yeah and j has a striking resemblance to himla that's true
um this utter muppet thought the marion luigi rpg series is all action and no
strats another bad case of seeing screenshots
equals yeah i've played it oh that's about arlo um yeah i haven't
seen like obviously uh fringy said he's seen a lot of his
videos i have not
are long man good yes we'd like to watch live but survivor
series is going on we'll watch on later but there is a super chat for you
thank you oh thanks thanks uh enjoy it later when you get around to it you'll
be watching this in the future is he a reviewer first or a cookie
monster first oh no
uh free hong kong there's a super tismy take on starship troopers by
generation film a thought for when you have sargon on
sure yeah absolutely and yeah is that the same group that do generation
tech i don't know
um yeah hong hong kong just had their elections
and uh the pro-democracy party they uh really stole it uh the pro-beijing
party basically got wiped out and the pro-democracy party did
really really well so they have like a super duper majority now so very very
good news well awesome free hong kong and
double trial do not touch china absolutely fuck china you know that meme
do not trust china and it is a little bit
well i do not like china china remakes everything worse everything china
touches just worse rags it's actually quite interesting how
high china is up on the human rights violation
and uh you know most countries just let it pass right on by because
because of money yep chinese money
rooks not even smart enough to say oh wait how did that happen
there we go can't wait to listen to this tomorrow while i do homework but for now
i've got to play ebroc galactic with my college friends
oh hope you had a good time see that's what i mean about trying to find out
what the average listen or watch time is for you know
efap ones it's uploaded because like when i'm playing a video game i usually
will chuck on one of the more recent efaps and just listen to it in the
background for hours like in generally i get through the whole
thing eventually so i'm expecting the watch time is gonna
be crazy i'm like four hours at least because
some people say yeah when i'm at work while i'm driving around while i'm doing
stuff around the house phone games yeah there's there's actually a high
demand for long-form content especially when you just need something that'll
last ages to unwind in the background that's why podcasts getting so popular
yeah because what happened was like everybody was parroting around youtube
that the way to do it is 10 to 20 minute videos you have to do
that for the algorithm like that was a thing that everyone kept saying
well yeah there was a time there was a time when that was
the thing that the algorithm really liked and really promoted
i don't know what it is now and i've never i've never changed for the
algorithm no i think the algorithm still
preferences longer form content because i tell you what after i watched the first
efap like on on mooler mooler yeah that one
um every single video in my recommendations was efap and i'm not
kidding if you i go to video and you look on my sidebar
it was like hundred percent efap it's like youtube registered how much i had
watched it was like give them more and just pushing it at me
yeah like uh because it was i can't remember how the rules exactly work
algorithm wise but the ones that people remember was that the um the animation
people got killed by the whole you need to have multiple uploads
regularly that are like 20 minutes um and then let's plays like flourished
like crazy let's because that's like markiplier pewdiepie jacksepticeye they
all exploded um but yeah and then there was a turn
to retention instead of you count i guess or
uh however exactly this worked i'd have to there's probably somebody who's kept
track of this better um well yeah they try like i've gone to
workshops and heard from you know um youtube insiders and all that stuff
and they uh one of the things they try and keep track of is view sessions how
long someone stays on the platform and so if your video is the first one they
watch but then they go on to stay and watch
several more youtube videos after that you will actually the first video will
get a kind of boost or benefit because youtube
like the algorithm notices that and and registers that this is a video that is
help keep helping keep people on the platform
and so i think with uh the efap content because it keeps people on the platform
for hours at a time because it's so long yeah i i know
for myself the algorithm just shoveled it in front of my face after
the first few times it's just funny i imagine it was such a
uh monkey wrench to the algorithm it's like 12 hour video 12 hour video what's
happening and people are watching it like
they're watching for a very long time i bet um
and so yeah there's interesting stuff
uh any gaming headset recommendations my old headsets falling apart and i need a
new one this one was given to me though so i
don't know what to get or what's good i mean i use a um
let me give an adh adg one and i really like it
um it's got a pretty decent microphone that comes attached with it though i use
the standalone for the own channel and everything
um but that's what i use adh adg one i've got a really good one but i
barely ever use it because i'm lazy and i neither set it up
sometimes so i just use cracky little headphones that are more comfortable but
anyway it's supposed to be a good one i can't
even remember the brand name is your your headset's not wireless is
it rags no mine's wired all my stuff's wired
um also hi rags hello i'll make six million cookie with
only 12 oven in short time cookie math no add up
well i'm not good at cooking that just sounds like a really popular baker if
he's having to make six popular million cookies i don't know why anyone would
have to make that many cookies it seems a little that seems
kind of crazy but i guess if your cookies are that
good and everybody wants them and loves them that much
i don't know i guess they just get baked uh
yo is my favorite colored guest fring boat howdy
oh we didn't tell friggy about steamboat damn steamboat
oh my goodness he needs to know oh yeah we're gonna have to get those
screenshots that ben posted who are uh fantastic stuff oh and you i
guess because you found out yeah it's not google images we'll be fine
yeah just look google images is this the shad man
not that shad man this is no hard no how many how many times have you had to
address that rarely ever because it's mostly
self-evident rather obvious yeah
uh do you fellas think dead space could be adapted well into a film
yes i think so but you need someone who's good at stuff yeah because a lot
of it is um a lot of it depending on where
on the go there's a lot of different places where a story could take place
but it would very much be a um it'd be an event horizon ish
style uh i sort more towards the beginning
and then it would become more like slasher
violent you know spooky body horror um but there would definitely be a
you know a multiple characters slowly but surely
succumbing to the you know the the the the psychosis
you know the the the i guess the the mental
tra the mental trauma of the marker and its effects and how that
and how that index affects individuals over time the things that they do
and keep things mysterious but yeah it would it would really make a great move
definitely has a lot of movie potential i mean we say
movie potential but i mean dead space has still a lot has a lot of game
potential but unfortunately i don't know what's
if they were ever gonna see another dead space
we'll see how that goes uh thanks for all the great content i couldn't make it
through work without y'all do we get a lot of comments like that a
lot of that pretty sure the content people just yeah
in the background just check it on the plane oh and i think there's a um
someone's making like a spiritual successor to
uh dead space called negative atmosphere right yes
um and apparently in an interview with gameinformer
the glen showfield who was the creator of dead space
he said he would love the chance to make a fourth installment
uh so i imagine if he had the uh i mean visceral they had plans for
dead space for they'd thought about some things
uh to some degree and if they could i mean if ea would just let
them make the fucking game that they wanted instead of saying it's got to be
a co-op action thing well then i would really like to i really
really like to see that because yeah i mean dead space one and two
were great three was fine but man the first two
were great just let them make a game i love the
first one so much
uh but who would want in a fight sarah connor from t2 or rippley from aliens
both are on neutral territory
depends what point in time you pick for sarah when you say neutral territory do
they have their weapons
if they don't so if they don't have weapons i'm pretty sure it's sarah
because she's like been training like crazy or
working out and stuff while rippley is still just uh
sort of a transport worker however that would be my call on it
if they have their weapons the good chance rippley wins because she's got
the hyper advanced stuff but maybe maybe not i don't know it's
kind of tough to call a lot of those specifications that come
into that one um hi mauler rags and guests hello
hello i recently debated if movies can be objectively bad and i was told bad
writing doesn't make a movie bad because of other elements making them good
eg action please respond to it and keep efapping
so uh this the response we've said beforehand with this one is that um
almost everything in a movie in terms of the crafts that are involved with it are
all attempting to present or project what's on the paper
that was originally there as in the script everything is attempting to get
you that information in different ways be it visually or
audio um and so if it's bad from the get-go those things
doing it well are crippled like by the foundations
so what would you say about Jackie Chan well
back in Jackie Chan's heyday you know um his movies because
generally bad acting um plots were very thin bare bones
and just really there as an excuse for the action but the choreography is
amazing and choreography was just phenomenal
um and so it's interesting because like i kind of
view those types of movies on a i compare it to a very different
standard uh because of that um and the standard that i'm putting it
against is pretty high and they fulfill it so well that
well they're brilliant but in terms of writing
it's most often not very writing in them if you if you're talking with somebody
like that super chatter um if you can get them in the door
in a sense that oh so if if you can get them to admit that you
can have objectively bad parts of a film then i think you've done a lot
just to get them to accept that yeah you know if we can whether or not
you take the whole film but don't don't worry about getting them to
do the whole will the film as a whole is objectively good or bad
um because people can draw that line anywhere
tlj if you can go and like if they won't admit it's a bad film they'll admit it's
poorly written just take take the w yeah because that'll
you know that's one of the parts and like okay well how do you assess it's
poorly written how do you assess that the scene is poorly
acted or poorly constructed that's like little pieces get them
to accept that little all the parts that make up the film
can be objectively bad and that does a lot
yeah um that's why i'm more so these days we'll say writing instead of the
movie as a whole but i do uh very much consider movies to
essentially just be a method in which a story is delivered
so it's like the writing is incredibly important
excellent singular aspects that don't actually pertain to writing it's
going to be pretty tough to argue that it like essentially
redeems the entire film but it wouldn't be something i'd want to ignore
like in the jack chan angle i'd want to definitely talk about
how amazing the choreography is assuming whichever
content was being discussed yeah if you had a reviewer
for instance who wouldn't who wouldn't say that a
film was objectively good or bad as a whole
but would say each individual part could be as obsessed uh
assessed objectively right then that would be
totally fine with me yeah because the whole thing the thing as a whole is a lot
more complicated than the individual parts
how they fit together and mesh together to to assess that objectively is
probably going to be pretty tough
um thief's awakening had no art style controversy
oh um i'm assuming that's in relation to what
points harlow is making and um i don't know enough about
thief's awakening to be able to comment on
the comparison oh yeah i wouldn't be surprised if this happens i mean
that happened with prince of persia too right years back they did one where it
was like a celly shaded kind of thing or whatever
every once in a while a game in a series will try something new or do a
different style probably happens all the time mechanics with god of war got a
lot of people arguing of whether or not uh god of war should or shouldn't have
the mechanic set that the new ones have or new one house sorry
um
okay uh dear efap would you rather throw j off a roof to save
save rags or throw quinton off a roof to save tonaled
i'd throw quinton off for well wait i would i don't see how that's why
would i choose yeah why would i choose to throw j off to
save me i get to save tonaled and sacrifice quinton or save rags and
sacrifice j i'll just go with the second choice
yeah quinton the choice is lose quinton or lose j
like i guess i'll lose quinton yeah only quinton
um hi rags love efap glad to see it live you good dog
hey hey glad you really like an efap and you might not see me for much longer
it's it's 240 i'm about oh
in fact i think i think i don't i think i gotta get to bed i can't i'm
i'm already starting to yeah i just i need to sleep i mean i really need to
sleep i want to it's all good like i said do you
mind just uh you mind muting instead of leaving
yeah i can do that you bet yeah i can uh yeah yeah haha so
i will uh i will catch everyone later and i will
um yeah let me know if there if there are super chants that
i will have any questions for me or anything yeah i i don't want them to go
um unanswered so i will see everyone later maybe i'll see you all tomorrow or
whatever tomorrow it's fucking it's already tomorrow
i will see you later on yes sir i will say hello bye bye
toodles
all right uh so uh i i can look at my notes and just
pull out um we got i got some shad questions so uh
all right shad what is your opinion on fallout's shish kebab
oh okay that's the fire sword isn't it um i would actually need another look at
it i i don't have a good enough mental image of it to comment
in detail on at the moment so i would have to defer until a proper
analysis do you want to look it up on google not
answer some other things while you're doing it or sure
find more i'll do that very well
hey guys love the podcast been watching for a long time now and love what you
guys do keep being awesome thank you very much
uh pokemon okay so yeah go ahead so yeah i'm just looking at now um
it's basically just a rusty blade that shoots fire along the edge
um intimidation i wouldn't really like the burning would be painful uh
but it wouldn't enhance the cutting capacity much at all really
so i don't think it wouldn't be you know hugely
more beneficial in fact if the if all the extra mechanics throws the weight off
but and it looks like the weight would be about double with everything that's
attached to it probably be a very unwieldy sword as a result and not
necessarily that much improved either so yeah
wouldn't necessarily be great
weight's important with swords oh yeah uh yeah
swords are much lighter than people assume and balance yeah
oh yeah absolutely and if you get a sword that's double the weight
than average it is suddenly massively unwieldy
so yeah those are my thoughts on this um shad if people buy your book
should they get the hardcover like i did to improve its effectiveness as a sword
like weapon oh absolutely uh i would i would recommend
well i would actually recommend both the audiobook and hardcover i generally do
this for all the books i enjoy i enjoy listening to an audiobook most of all
but i love owning divisible copies and you'll see them in my um bookshelf
behind me and uh and yeah and when you're gonna
own a book you want the hardcover because it's more weighty
it has more presence and i get more money from the hardcover as well so
um hello shadow diversity any software you recommend for writing
novels and keeping notes weird can be a bit tismy sometimes
lots of info but i got it back well the two ones that i've recommended my
channel is both uh campfire but campfire had a
upgrade called campfire blaze that's the one you're going to look at
or world anvil and so there's pros and cons to both world anvil
uh generally looks to be a better utility for world looting
um and but you certainly can do writing on it
but campfire blaze is more structured for a writing assist and if you're
wanting something to just help like with sentence structure
better than i a normal spell check grammily i've heard good things
about um uh i'm a little reluctant to try
grammily because it can be a bit too specific on
its recommendations of your sentence structure which could
um actually change your narrative voice too far from what you normally would go
with but it's also important to just learn
what good grammatical sentence structure is
but also to keep the structure the way that you would naturally write so it can
be so grammily is a little i'm a little on the fence with that one
but those are those are the ones i recommend at the moment
there you go yeah i i was gonna say uh i couldn't forget remember the name but
i remember the uh talking about the world anvil one
on one yeah they're both really really good so um
it's just like i think they both have or world anvil has uh
uh most of its main features are free
but you don't get well actually i don't know if it changed that so i won't
really comment on any of the features in the case of updated things and things
but um but yeah try both and see what works best for you
um shad have you read wizard's first rule by goodkind
i have heard good things of it i have not read it myself yet but i
but it has um been reviewed in a very high regard
and so it's on my maybe list like i don't unfortunately i don't get too much
time to read but and when i do i tend to like to go
back to the ones that i know i enjoy i i'm on my my third or fourth
listened through the wheel of time audiobook this is so good
um and uh because i've i've tried several new books like recently
and few have grabbed me as well as the ones that i know
really good but i think the next thing i'm going to be listening to
is the stars uh skyward the sequel to skyward from
sinneson um and so that's good um shad how do you feel about the different
styles of lightsaber combat and lightsaber pikes
well i have a lot of views of on that and i think i need to save it for a
whole video because i find there are a lot of assumptions
that people make when they're trying to write a pop culture kind of fighting
style um and they get a lot of things wrong
in regards to what actually is a fighting style
and and it seems like with uh the jedi ones
that the each different style is really a different
stance a different guard but a guard is very different to a style of fighting
um and and the guard that you pick is usually
the position of your sword only in the beginning of the first engagement
and once the engagement starts you're in a completely adapt you go to a different
guard to a different guard all the time you never revert to the same guard
position and so the assumption that you know the jedi ones is like this
this is the guard position like that they present these styles by guard
positions like no that's very wrong with how sword fighting is done
um and so that that's that's worth a whole video that i'm gonna
um i want to research a bit more so i'll go through each individual
supposed style but at the moment just from what i've
looked on from a cursory glance is that they didn't understand what a sword
fighting style is at all oh yeah there you go um
just gonna expect a video on that eventually yes
indeed uh pokemon eight is to me what episode eight
is to you final fantasy eight also sucks what's up with eights
or it means they should have died a long time ago
uh long man bad long man good here be cash
gutty woo all right
i know it's very it's very talented very kind at the same time
wonderful stuff uh maula don't know if you saw my tweet 100 more violence at
frozen two screenings and joker just saying
yeah rags mentioned it quite amazing to be honest uh
didn't expect that but hey i'm gonna go um well yeah i might be going to see
uh frozen two with the family in about a week or so
so i'll let you know if there's any more machete um attacks
i should take a sword with me be ready for it take a giant machete with you
gosh swords are more than just being giant machetes maula you hurt me
oh no i'm saying take the sword but also take a giant machete in case they demand
a machete fight all right all right all right i withdraw my complaint i might
pull a bit of an honor system on you and be like hey
can't be using a sword in a machete fight you'll be like all right all right
oh you're watching this there are like actual real machete fights online that
you can look up and they are savage i would recommend like they're
they're like real world full-blown violence and
they usually like it these things in either i don't know philippines
somewhere in asia or africa and where just there's these full-blown machete
fights getting whipped down like to the death
yeah i get well you do see people well they will have to have died from it
but it's instructive to like i actually the reason why i researched this was
i did a video on how deadly swords really are in real life
and one of the more accurate points of reference you can look to to try and
find what real you know slashing wounds how
debilitating they are is actually modern day machete fights because we have
visual record of what and it what's interesting is how
survivable cuts are and that's kind of the thing
that i point out in my video is that in one of these machete fights you see
i get like hacked heaps and he's still alive for a good
portion of it just getting and they're like doing these full-blown
wide hack swings with these machetes of course he would have died eventually
from it but yeah people don't understand what type of attacks from a sword is
truly deadly that would be an instant kill
and what ones are survival and and when it comes to cuts it's actually kind of
surprising how how how i guess functional you can maintain
yourself with certain cuts but then a smaller
cuts in other parts of the body can fully debilitate you like you have a
slash upon the back of your wrist and it takes out yeah ability to grasp your
sword it's kind of game over right there if
it's cut above your eye the blood will just flow down and blind you
and so yeah it's all very very um uh i guess uh
context space where where the cut is landing there okay sorry not to mention
um your adrenaline will be running high right so
keep you in the fight to a degree but uh yeah if they if they you know like
just nab an artery uh oh yeah because the other thing is
people expect swords are gonna cut people in half and some swords have the
capacity to do that but not every sword does
and so it's all very very you know dependent on the situation in half wouldn't
it oh and the sharpens of the sword has a
massive impact on this as well and so there are so many variables to
take into account
um finally got a job so take my money you beautiful bastards p.s you made
borderlands 3 suck for me don't buy it keep up the good work and i
will hear this when i watch it later thank you very much and uh sorry about
borderlands 3 i guess um hi rags love your unbridled rages
i i'm sure he'd appreciate that uh quick take on someone using head cannon to
explain why layer communicates with only poe in tlj opening battle
being pose button cut layer off from the rest of the squadron should i even
bother with them it doesn't make any sense um and it also
calls into question who moved the bombers in place
because all poe did was tell them to attack
it seemed like they were all set up anyway and then you have the problem
of um they're nowhere near the main fleet
and like they had poe returned to the fleet before they could leave
the bombers have to do that too and if so they were never gonna make it anyway
so like there's a lot of questions about that opening bit and why is it that the
commander would have a button like a station a design specific button to cut
off the capital ship from every other ship
like in communications like why would that be the case that'd just be weird
and if that's not the case uh then why couldn't she talk to the others
and if she shows to talk to the others would her authority outdo
the like her authority is general which is usually for ground troops right
would she outdo it at a flight commander captain style
admiral whatever person like i don't know what should she be doing it
surely his judgment should be respected especially because he's in the field
there's so many questions and there is there's so many things in this that
whole movie which is just baffling i just like
i just don't think they care they're gunning for the uh the payoffs the
emotional things and they only know how to do it
in specific ways i guess which is just to make things
not really make sense or whatever it doesn't matter
um it's just depressing because it wouldn't take too much thought to
realize how dumb some of these things are it's like well we just did a cloaking
scanner to take the ship it's like what just think about this please
imagine they had a throwaway library like we use our uh
scat to fight the ship but then some random trooper's like hey
why don't we run that all the time then he's like we only have enough
battery to run that once per week you're like oh
imagine that was the case but yeah you know oh
wow rags release the final rage of game of thrones please
uh i know that's directed at me and it's on the cards for like
i know how i would go about doing it to get it done it's just that there's so
many other projects i want to do and honestly with my episode 5 video i
really felt like i tackled all of the significant characters and how they've
been potentially ruined like there's more to say about how episode 6 ends for
sure it's just that i really felt uh quite
completed after i did episode 5 video because that took
ages and i got so many like points out that i really wanted to
specifically game of thrones i mean like but i still do want to do an episode 6
one and possibly more for game of thrones i don't
know but yes apps in the future uh pineapple on pizza is wrong yes very
good super chat accuracy i'm glad i'm glad he understands this
this is this is good uh more let's stop being a fury and a
big gay that must be directed at rags
oh fuck that i like pineapple on my pizza no more super chat money for b
oh heresy that's that's just the sacrifice you
got to make you know no more super chat money in exchange for
establishing that yes pineapple pizza is the work of the devil
you've ruined my dreams he's the myth of an apocalyptic event
that's like the most meme-able thing ever i mean that is pineapple on pizza is
the signs of an apocalyptic event isn't it it is it is
um thanks for making the work day and commute entertaining and far more
interesting i'm glad it is uh good stuff
does rags believe in free will because if so you can change opinions by choice
i don't know that he does believe in like
100 strictly free will i don't i don't i don't know if we've covered that yet or
not um but that's a huge topic and we
nearly got to it uh in the beginning of this stream
nearly got to it nine hours ago uh weird logos like a sword and no
fallacy shall stand wield logos like a sword and and no
fallacy shall stand oh sorry we'll wield logos like a sword
and no fallacy shall stand i got you like logic i guess and um
this uh yeah point you know uh a lot of people can detect fallacies without
knowing what their names are like um who are pretty good at it like the
couple were brought up today he used uh no true scotsman about um
what was it a surrealism it's like it's not true surrealism it's like what the
fuck is that
choice is conscious oh god we're going to be getting a lot of
oh really deep stuff right choice is conscious belief is
subconscious you don't control your subconscious directly you can influence
it belief is not a choice it's a result
like a result of choices you could there's an argument you made that
this is semantical like well i think it is ultimately it's
just kind of how rags defined belief as opposed to how i
defined it and if i use his definition i'll probably
be an agreement i've just kind of defined it differently i guess um
and even just with a stupid chat then i he read that as like again
it's like it's a result of choices you know yeah
i was gonna say we can't it's not gonna be first of all rags doesn't even get to
speak on a lot of his uh his points so i wouldn't
want to reopen it in that way but also i don't
think we have the time to reopen the subject
it's true we don't have time but rags left he doesn't get his say that's
that's how that's on him yes he is forfeit his say
that's right rags amala thank you both for helping me smile and laugh through
one of the worst times in my life i started watching your channels then
found efap thanks again love you guys yeah man uh
we always love to hear the people are enjoying the show honestly good stuff
despite the fact that it is a million years long oh yeah we calculated that
by average podcast lengths we'd be up to like episode 210 now
and by normal i'm in two hours so yeah happy episode 2010 guys
or 210 not 2003 it's interesting how efap just has an
easy listen polity to it where it's just a bunch of mates
just chatting and hanging out and having fun and you know
and having intelligent discussion so there's a very you know intellectually
stimulating side to just the casual nature of it so it
works really well oh yeah there's loads of just you know
no one's immune to being challenged your perspectives
will be will be yeah i i just i'm waiting for the time until i have a
horrible take in a video it has to happen sometime right
like just really really bad in fact i should probably
i think i i have some that i've taken down because i now disagree with
so i wonder if i should we should dig some of those up and just do a
efap review on them if only you'd put a video saying joker was an awful film
yeah i should have done that hey it's awful because i did not enjoy it
because if ever you you had like a take we wanted to cover efap we probably
just ask you to come on for it as well and you can you can give us insight into
the creation indeed watch memento people can be aware
of lying to themselves then forgetting to have done so
that is belief for a greater good or inner peace
they can be aware of lying to themselves and then forget to have done so
but that doesn't represent belief though even if that was the case in certain
instances and circumstances so um i wouldn't say
it contradicts the rule not that represent belief
lying yeah even that i would need to try and yeah i would need to break it down
and try and understand what it's saying is it like oh because he writes messages
do not trust do not believe his lies and so he believes that despite the fact
that it's not actually based on valid information
interestingly because uh memento is pretty cool
oh well yeah check it out it's very unique
you watch the film backwards okay um it's like the only film of his kind
that kind of what's interesting is um that and prestige prestige is a film
that essentially oh yeah i've been prestige oh yeah that's like watching
three shorter films all at once that all connect to each other once they hit
the end um i love prestige amazing shit it's
like one of my favorites memento less so but you know it's
cool um so rags oh i'm gonna have to save
that one oh and there's a question for wolf as well
um i like my women like i like my coffee
inside of me oh my okay off to goal tend in the best
objective sport ice hockey you masses need to read attack on titan
and berserk cheers i mean could i have my watch yeah watch
a decent chunk of attack on titan um i probably might read berserk because
i do like realistic fantasy even if it gets really dark and i know
like berserk gets really dark um but that has come with some good
recommendations so maybe and best objective sport being ice
hockey i don't even mind if that's the case
go nuts yeah i'm sorry like i'm not really interested in sports to be
invested enough to have an opinion on so
yeah uh are we all just sleeping slaves to fate
butcher yati um that's a reference i don't quite get it but
i completely agree um fax versus feelings with an innate
judgment is scientifically a matter of personality type
not necessarily choice
also sounds as in smash by the way um good stuff
fax versus feelings with innate judgment is scientifically a matter of
personality type not choice oh i think i yeah that um
like personality um uh tests where you know they certain they get ratings for
agreeableness and um disagreeableness and all these
things that they generally have found that uh certain character types um
have uh preferences general preferences i think that i i'm not an expert on this
but i think there's exceptions even there but they find general trends to
people being far more um feelings based in determining
what their opinions are versus facts and stuff and that's it's interesting
science that stuff um i don't know how final and complete it
is but i have heard interesting things about it so
yeah where would that apply what we're talking about i don't know i need to
uh rags is barney fife see emancipation proclamation
i don't know who barney fife is oh
in the andy griffith show
well i didn't watch it so i don't know anything about it but uh
fair enough fun fact pineapple is one of the few foods that you can eat
that can eat you back this means that people who like hawaiian pizza are
automatically into vore right the pineapple can eat you is that because
of the absence i know when you eat too much pineapple
like you have to sting your mouth um like we gave our kids some pineapple
now are young and i think our younger say too much and
he was like
um howdy rags he would say hi springy it's not about free will but
rather the moral foundation theory some people are not capable of thinking
in a certain way you peeps look it up
i might do at some point this is a lot of topics you know in efap
we do cover these things every once in a while but like
to get too far into one of these things without someone who's like extremely
well read on it we can only stay in like layman terms while also discussing it
on a rather uh on on a tier without citing like
studies or specific lines of thought or world views and stuff
and even if we did do that that we would then need to explain it in case
any guests or audience members weren't quite following
like isn't really this isn't really that show if you know what i mean
while you've got a lot of places on youtube you can totally find
explorations into this stuff yeah and uh i'm always a little hesitant uh when
people take certain studies like that and draw
too much of a categorical conclusion when
because what was that super chat saying certain people are incapable
of thinking a certain way was that some people are not capable of thinking a
certain way yeah so you know like
i generally found the people like and i you could say it's anecdotal
but when people really set their mind to it they can overcome
a lot of you know barriers to learn certain things that they need that
is really important for them to learn and i'm not saying that's the case with
everyone i'm just saying a decent amount of people and so to just say
that so categorically i was like uh i don't know
you know i'm just a bit more cautious about definitive statements like that
um i think free will is absolutely an illusion no matter what you choose
if one were to question your choices with why after why
you would eventually reach the conclusion of i don't know that's just
what i want what i want to do yeah but there's a contradiction just in
the very structure of that thing even if well no matter what you choose by
merely stating that you've acknowledging choice to a certain level
even if you try and say that there was no way you could choose anything
other than what was uh what you were kind of coerced by
circumstance stuff like that to me there's actually no true
courage you still have the freedom to use the a or nay there's nothing forcing
you um and even if you could say i i've
only chosen a certain way because of well i'm stopping now this is that i'm
that's a rabbit hole that i was gonna say you're gonna go to
predetermined yes yeah let's end that before we can
know people knew that we were heading toward that and that's the problem if we
open up that like there was people in chat who were like talking about it as
well that was just like uh-oh if we go there
this this efap will be just that yeah i'll just point out that i find
interesting that even people who disagree with free will
someone's like oh it seems interesting that when they structure what they're
saying around the very nature of choice uh but perhaps i'm
misrepresenting exactly what i'm saying because he did try and cover that
afterwards but so yeah uh very complicated loads of like
everyone in chat is gonna have differing degrees of having
looked into it and that's the same for the guests as well as understanding all
the concepts and so like i said it's like
certain things efap can only scratch the surface of while
hoping to just get some discussion out of it um i love how it all came from him
saying that you're taking away like people's
feelings when you say something is bad that's where we drew out of that that was
glorious 40 minutes yeah i know there's a lot
time back right there um appreciate the weeks of entertainment
from you all oh yeah glad you're enjoying it dr pepe
welcome sir even though i don't contribute nearly as much as
rags but still no you're up there you're high on the list
i think um let me have a look efap
let me you're higher because uh there's not a lot of people who
do sort of come on regularly but you're one of them i know it goes uh fringy and
jay and metal they're like the highest ones and
that's bullshit yeah so they're the four super regulars you're the first of the
rest if you know what i mean you you come on
nice you're tied for most appearances and you've got one hour more
than any one the next person all right and that'll go up after this one
i'll get there you'll get a number eight uh so we'll
well like i said you've got seven appearances fringy's got 26
metals got 19 jay's got 18 decibels it's got 12 like
the clocking in a lot of numbers um yeah
which came first the cosmic chicken or the cosmic egg
oh i can't remember what we decided about that
if we said well i mean uh like i'm a christian and so i technically would be
the chicken well there you go i don't know i
i think we talked about the chicken versus the egg argument on efap before
we have to we talked about like how species work and stuff
as as you do as naturally tangent uh this is what mauler wants he's not even
going to play elevator music i usually only play elevator music if i'm
not in the argument right and that's not even 100 in the case
but like this is a discussion for all of us
and so like playing elevator music would be like why wouldn't i just play
elevator music all the time we pause um because and oftentimes the elevator
music one it's usually something nonsensical or petty or stupid or funny
like not an actual serious discussion on um
well how do you how do you get world views and stuff so yeah i just didn't
think the the elevator music worked for that bit
um hell yeah if this drum lasts five more hours i'll have a birthday fap
i'm pretty sure it definitely did
shad thoughts on sword fighting in zelda
which zelda breath of the world or well it doesn't specify so pick whichever
one you want i guess again that's something i actually need to
watch while paying attention so uh because generally i just play casually
but from what from memory uh over swinging telegraphed and he throws a
shoot out of position when he strikes and things like that and that's
that's general gameplay um animations for swords and stuff because they like
to convey a lot of movement and telegraphing and motion so the player
can kind of pre-empt how the attacks are gonna go
um but i don't think you need to do that every
instance you can actually have far more non-telegraphed historical you know
move sets that work perfectly well in a video game and
kingdom come deliverance is the best example of that so
so yeah all right
uh robot head claims the first episode of mandalorian is lazy
but i believe it went well establishing character tone pace what are your
thoughts um so uh i've talked to robot head
about his video and um i invite him to come on to efap
next week and we're possibly going to watch his video live
but um he might not be able to make it he said that he's uh is 50 50 right now
so if he can't we'll do something else but um as soon as
he's able we might be able to do that it'll be our first ever
efap with the person who's made the video i think anyway so i i was eating
while watching the first episode and so i got distracted and i i don't think i
have a a perfectly clear picture i'm not if
you can get perfectly clear but a clear enough picture of the first episode to
kind of comment but i really enjoyed it i thought it was
great i really liked the first episode this is the best one out of the three as
far as i'm concerned
um this is where i get kind of some biases coming in because
i have to say i like i love the baby in it
like that's yeah that's cute uh beyond belief and just the the way
that they have the you know it interact with the
bandolorian even in the such small little things like oh
oh dude the uh when it was when the bay was playing with the thing it screwed
off the handle i loved the fact that he's about to
leave and he goes to pull the handle i was like oh that's
great and then he's like nope i'm coming back
for it i was like oh i liked episode three a lot i just um
had a lot of problems with it that i was like damn it
why did you have to have these things you didn't have to have these things
um then episode two i only had a few issues with it but also
i got really put off by um how much of it felt like filler
to me yeah yeah i do admit that episode two was
could have been all avoided because it was just fixing the ship basically
but i do kind of see why they wandered it in
uh for certain narrative elements because that um helped him
come a little bit more indeed towards you know the baby because the baby saved
his life and stuff and so that's that was fairly
important for the character progression i want to clarify i don't hate filler as
a whole um it's just that it's such a small
amount of episodes that i'm like oh man i want it to be
like constant plot progression so i get my
juicy content you know instead of i don't mind hanging out with the
mandalorian as a character doing something that doesn't amount to much
of anything or fixes a problem that started in the
episode that's fine i just um yeah like i said it's
totally subjective i'm just like i just want more things to happen
i think that i find interesting like the mandalorian
you know is that we know so little about him
yet he is already such a more engaging interesting character than ray like
oh yeah there's no question and like it's all right he's failing a lot like
he's bailed out quite a few times yeah and he struggles as well and you
know something traumatic happened in his past through
certain flashbacks and it establishes in a far more
subtle way his you know more his ethics his standards and his
character and he's very quick to kill the droid when
uh yeah it was great yeah there's a lot and and i like that
he speaks so likes like so little yet we get to learn so
much about his character just because his actions are more
significant and yes he chooses his words carefully um
and doesn't speak much yeah so it's it's lots to like about a mandalorian i
won't deny that um i just i guess i'm like
oh it's such a it's such an awkward sort of thing where it's just like oh star
wars i miss you yeah i know
you know do you reckon he's gonna come across a jedi at some point like
um have the lightsaber like oh damn you know
what is he gonna do i really don't know what they're planning with this
like i got i got nothing man like i don't know what they're gonna do gee
then my like i wonder if there's gonna be an obi-wan cameo for his upcoming
series oh yeah that could happen
um but yeah it's a hell of a lot better than the sequel films
oh yeah i know um how much would y'all have to get paid to take an uppercut
from mike tyson in his prime can't block can't dodge you gotta
take it yeah i just say no yeah me too i just
say no i mean like money uh isn't that i'm not gonna risk
permanent as long as i have enough yeah exactly i i value so many things above
money and my own personal health is most
certainly one of them um what makes good lamp bother uh
so good lamp would be uh how cost effective it is
how how much light it provides how much space it takes up
uh the aesthetic you know there's lots of lots of things that come into what
makes good lamp i'm not a lamp designer myself but i'm
sure i could offer some criticisms for what i would consider bad lamps
yep i'm glad we've uh we've gone through this important
it's because the daughter's arc involves her wanting to get into
college so she needs to still be in high school
i'm not sure that's referencing
daughter's arc involves her wanting to get into college so she needs to be in
high school i'm trying to think of what films you may have been talking about
yeah i don't know
starts an arlo video prattles on about anything else yep this is my first time
reaction to arlo oh that's my first direction to arlo i
mean that's starting to become just you know
videos that um say say something that that requires a lot of defining and they
don't bother with it it leaves us to want to explore it
um and then ends up making it so that they have to stay on pause for a while
because they've not directed us in any way so we'll just be like
exploring because uh i like discussion a lot
yeah me too and there was a lot of things undefined in that video
unfortunately it was just um swordman bad oh no no
swordman good yes how dare you sir
how dare you uh do an efap where batman eats toothpaste
is that again i think i think someone someone sent that last time do an efap
where batman eats toothpaste i don't know what that means
terrifying it's like a uh you know one of those viral youtube videos
have you seen the one where he eats a burger eats a what sorry
a burger it's just a a small animation clip of batman looking really serious
holds up a burger and just eats a burger and i was like it's glorious
okay i guess there's one for doing his teeth washing his teeth sorry
all right there might be i didn't know the toothpaste one
uh in two dogmas of empiricism wvo quine supports a holistic theory of
meaning where statements are not accepted as true
in isolation but within a web those closer to the edge are easier to change
sounds relatively reasonable yes that's that's one of those statements i
need to listen to a couple of times and absorb fully so i can understand
exactly the implications of being said so
sorry i didn't absorb at all you know it's been a long day well that's the
thing man um a lot of people can get testy with
some of the stuff we say toward the like later parts of streets and stuff but i
was just like i don't know braiden starts to say some
funny things when it's been doing this for this long
exactly it's like words they just kind of start going together when you get
us in utah we have a lot of mormons that
believe in the church despite accepting all the evidence that it's false
they know that joseph smith was a con man but they still believe he was a
prophet of god oh my goodness
i've heard all of this crap before so don't think
people are trying to you know spam stuff like this that i haven't i was a
missionary for the church for two years and i
love going into all the nitty-gritty details especially with
church history and stuff like that and joseph smith
is a legend right he was not a con man not at all
and that's all i will say on that before things get too derailed
i mean i know nothing about it so um well i mean outside of what i've heard
from like so far you know just someone attacking my
religion don't worry more i'm young man we have we on efab it's all fair game
but uh i know yeah and like you me and rags we've had a you know good fun long
kind of discussion debate on uh logical validity for deity and stuff
like that so it's not anywhere we haven't gone before i was playing
left for dead i remember i was killing zombies while discussing
religion yep someone's it's funny it's like it's
not something i hide because i'm just reading chat now it's like
it is a moment like yes this is it's mostly common knowledge unless
people have only more recently learned of who i am and stuff
certainly not something i hide shad is a christian kangaroo
uh-huh um well hey look at this back-to-back super chat you go the next
one is hey shad recently finished your book and i really enjoyed it
oh thank you sir means a lot to hear uh also high wags
oh you would say hi back he's just a little sleepy
um in my opinion your opinion is evil
in your opinion you underestimate my opinion obi-wan
just just to reply to again people it's funny that people have a really
negative view on religion and particularly mine
it's like you know they get something like a you know like a dog with a bone
and they can't let go and they're saying joe smith was found guilty
historically yeah and those charges were also
dropped and admitted by the state that they were false as well
it's funny how people just they get stuck in a certain mindset
and they either ignore blatantly obvious facts that have already been
established for a very long time and uh because again i don't know they
really and anyway sorry it's okay uh jab cheese is
objectively good cheese i can agree with that
i was watching the sunset who's the talking muppet also high rags
talking muppet was arlo and um hopefully we won't
i don't know incite an ire from his community
when covering him you never know with every single new person we cover
who's got an audience i didn't see it coming with jenny
i honestly thought that was just going to be your average efap like yep
she just i think it's because of the fact that she had a vlog style i was
like no one's going to really care if we cover this
um but she tweeted out that's probably what did it
yeah and uh and yeah it seems like people were very
you know defensive about any criticism that go to her
and yet their responses were so disingenuous like
so much of the criticism they were lobbying against efap
was the exact same level of stuff that they themselves were
doing in trying to claim that you know it was a bunch of guys just in cells
that hate women it's like what yeah you know
like we got we got fans of women on this podcast rags a big fan of women
i'm married i have four children did i say you know
yes i'm clearly an insult yeah i say i'd say sorry oh gosh
um yeah it was weird stuff then the way that a lot of conversations went was
uh they talked about it for 11 hours the response is no they didn't
uh they they only talked about a couple of hours if you actually were to watch
it and then they were like why would i watch that long of a podcast
can you like that so this conversation was uh worthwhile
yeah it's just because it's like why would he want watches like
actually a lot of people do and they kind of enjoy the long-form stuff
and so it's it's like such a nothing argument where people try to say
try and criticize it for being longs like oh my goodness you guys just
you don't understand it um joker is a very emotional film shad is a very
cerebral person oh that was there uh the the superchats
guess as to why you didn't like it oh okay um
well no i wasn't for that i could feel the emotionality but it made me feel
negative emotions as a result uh just like you know it wasn't uplifting or
enjoyable for me um but that doesn't mean it isn't a
brilliantly made film but um it's just interesting like to what
standard you you apply things to i am i downright
felt a bit of awe at the end of uh joker the parries on the car i was kind
of just like wow um from the whole film quite the experience
watching that story and then i get it like uh
nobody like the idea that it's just like a story that doesn't have what you make
whole a more traditional good or happier ending
it's um a lot of people lose in the ending of joker
yeah yeah i mean it it's a tragic story like overall and so
like yeah
um fyi emotions focus on non-determinable things while cerebral
focuses on specifics
emotions focus on non-determinable things
sorry repeat that i got distracted emotions focus on non-determinable
things non-determinable i would like to know
what he means by that because that requires a little more
clarification kind of comment on um death by guinea pigs
that is possibly a reference to no bullshit uh what do you think of destiny
and what he does um i've watched a whole bunch of his
debates i quite like his desperation for
references clear argumentation however a lot of his conclusions are
a little crazy for me um it would be interesting to talk to them
sometime but i wouldn't want to piss him off as in like i wouldn't want to be the
guy who fucking stresses him out or anything
he seems very volatile um but i've seen a couple of debates where
he has common conversations i'd like to assume that it's because of
people using fallacies and stuff but you start to wonder like
90 of his debates end in carnage and so you're like is it really that many
people who are fucking it up it's like maybe i don't know
um but then you know there's some other stuff
the like positions he holds that i'm very uncomfortable with
uh but yeah overall i mean i'm okay he's like a big spag i guess yeah i
barely know anything about him i've only seen him in one debate um
that was live streamed and that that was it which one was that do you remember
it was uh a hymn star gone someone from the young turks and was it nick
foyntes oh yeah yeah yeah her son nick foyntes
and uh it was it was i think train wrecks was the host
i i think that one was interesting so many different perspectives all clashing
at once yeah yeah interesting is a good way to
put it um youtubers decreed you are to receive a
free super chat why thank you uh i saw lord of the rings i
liked lord of the rings i hate j s j has still yet to see lord of the
rings and we told him to watch it in like
efap five so uh no excuse
um wait does this dude hate the core concept of dialectic processes that's an
interesting position to take of course it's never ending
i'm not sure what part of alo's video that we'll be referring to
unfortunately
when video turns legit anti-free speech we are here
there was a you know honestly if you could if you don't want to recount the
point of alo's video i think the best i could say is just
i think he wants people to let people say stuff without as much repercussion as
is happening these days
but i'm like the complete opposite pull people to their statements
and think carefully about your statements
um and just separate out when you want to be left alone as in like you know
yeah i just didn't like that thing that's you know it's fine leave me alone
you can do that but if you start making claims whoa
it's like um making a claim is also countering any claim that would be
counted to it at the same time especially if you're trying to be
definitive so of course it can be combative on its own
you don't even realize who you're actually pissing off you might make a
tweet saying uh you know a bunch of things and you're
like i've expressed my opinion and then thousands of people respond
and i guess i'm partially referring to anita sakisian here
very applicable because she said there's no wibid in episode one about deloria
which is objectively false and so she said she
actually admitted it was a mistake as well i never thought i'd see that
but didn't she then just bust it off like oh she said
she said uh women can't make mistakes online without blah blah blah blah and i
was like oh my god she says a mistake
i don't know everything sexist even when people call you out for a mistake it's
because you're a woman that people are calling you out are
you insane oh she knew to the world men get you know
ruined through their opinions online oftentimes
yeah i mean are you guys getting attacked because you were men
um if me or all women we're all women i wonder how that would have gone
interesting question actually i don't know how they would have dealt with it
yeah because like yeah like sorry no it's okay i just i'm trying to
think of what would have happened they'd have been confused they'd be like what
is wow what they might you might get us to go as far as
getting comments like what catty women or what bitchy women i guess
like from and then they'd have to be reined in because it's like
guys you can't be making these comments defending like someone else who's uh
you would you would definitely be have a problem with people calling her that or
something like it would it would cause an explosion they would be confused as to
how to deal with this but yeah unfortunately we were born with the
wrong parts and now it makes us unable to uh
i guess benefit from such results freewell is a myth religion is a joke
we're all pawns controlled by something greater
and that is memes the dna of the soul high rags kick j love don
uh fine trolls fine troll memes of the life blood of reality
we all know this indeed um i hope that super chat saw the
extended version i i yeah reading out everything in full
hopefully uh brooks as wesker j yeah i mean brooks his voice is a
horrible compared to wesker so it's not going to happen i'm sorry he doesn't
he's not allowed um this one just i get thrown every time
they say yeah everyone was you know calling because
his name is brooks but that's my last name as well as i like
sometimes i thought people it's like hey bros who what well yeah because the
thing is his monica is no bullshit and it's really awkward to say that in a
sentence like what do you think of no bullshit you
might be like what what yeah um i mean i i don't swear
but i you know depending on what you consider to be a swear word in
whatever you know region you're from because
australia has certain words that aren't words and anyway but that's one of
them that i won't say uh and so i wouldn't i just
can't refer to his channel name as no bull stuff there we go
oh the meme quote was apparently from male gear rising
so uh it wasn't like the person saying it i guess and uh yeah the uh
it's it's complicated because you can then call him knobs
uh which is funnier because it's like an abbreviation of no bs but
even then you can feel really confusing and so he goes by brooks for a lot of um
also i can't remember if his yeah i think i guess this is first name might
actually be brook i don't really care i just call him all kinds of different
things depending on how i'm feeling at the time
it's very subjective must yes indeed the most tismy massive place i've ever
been has to be the isle of man it's either that or the celestial diabeto
jeb is objectively a gay leftist i remember that uh
that's the the thing we did uh getting different adjectives ad vibs and nouns
rags love the dog bites vids um you know i'll keep that even though
uh it's not really a question i'm sure rags will like to hear that especially
because you got monetization on it recently
he's condemning the kind of people who would say if you hate the last jedi is
because you hate women why is this a problem
uh because he's really inconsistent throughout the whole video we i'm pretty
sure we agreed with that part yeah we have like it as the discussion
progressed we did say okay this part if it's in this context we're absolutely
yeah because we brought that up i think several times actually the whole like
you only hate the last jedi because you don't like women oh
my argument didn't involve any of that and it's like yeah well
such a brainless thing to say i was just i can't believe it's become so
prominent and that they actually push it and it
just shows the disingenuous nature behind these types it's just insane
but like if if you get to that point you can be like why would you know like if
me and you hear this guy who's like a known
admitted person who just hates just every single race other than white or
something we'd be like okay you want to listen to his take on the
movie i'd be like i don't know because i don't even know that he can be he can
see clearly at that point like if he's going to be looking
so i guess what i'm trying to get at is that if they can put you into that camp
they no longer have to listen to what you said
yeah that's the point behind it um and that's why it's so disingenuous because
if you actually if you know argue the facts
they generally lose because their facts are pretty bad and so
we'll just you know i pissed off a whole bunch of people
when i said if you say the last jedi is good content good luck calling other
pieces of content bad it's gonna be very hard
and uh it's just a simple like people got really upset at it they were like
he's saying they're not allowed to have their own opinions i was like no it's
just a matter of if you claim this thing is a bad thing and it
turns up in the last jedi tenfold then how are you gonna explain that
it's crazy uh jenny said that the theme in joker was like whatever the theme
may have been she couldn't figure it out uh it was contradicting itself anyway
i was just like contradicting its theme that's like all over tlj and she
really liked that film
all right um i love listening to you guys you're all unique and make me laugh
i'm very grateful to be able to listen to such a clever group of people
oh thank you very kind as long as we can be entertaining or
informative or i guess is informative a type of
entertaining i wonder if that can suit is considered
under the umbrella but you know yeah like if something is
legitimately interesting and intellectually
stimulating it is a form of entertainment and
that's kind of where i get a lot of i guess the interest in my own content
is because my content is pretty you know
fact-heavy at times when i talk about a lot of um
very complex things and i think one of the things that helps go
take it through is that i like to think the information is interesting but it's
also being able to present complex things in a
more dynamic engaging way is another you know
uh thing that helps me with content if you can if you can pull it off
and i like to think i can in some instances
i guess i hope efap is comedic dramatic and informative the trifecta of
the stuff there you go that's my that's my very in-depth assessment
but that i agree uh when is next efap gaming
also high rags there's never any set for when those happen
they're just gonna happen but uh we have ideas and
that goes the same for efap movies of which seven are attempting to release
and that goes the same for uh the minis for like because you know
once once we we got one batman woman episode coming up in
five days six days and um once that's done apparently we're
gonna want a hiatus for a while with batwoman other than the um
crossover episode which we're not sure if we're doing i guess we might be
either way um i was just gonna say like i don't know
if we'll be replacing it or anything like i know people be like oh can you do
another tv show so i'm just like i don't know batwoman was like a perfect storm
with this i don't know if there's the other shows that will just
work as well it's kind of tough
i made the mistake of looking at chat again and people are still going on
about mormon stuff or at least one or two of them are
it's okay they can't seem to let it go this can't be
something they're saying is like objectively incorrect like you want to
know what mormons believe you might want to ask mormon instead of
people who are just cutting like literal incorrect facts about
um certain things in our doctrine and history and belief like
it's just amazing the misinformation that's out there so yeah if you do want
to know things about mormons ask a mormon
that's probably a way to get more correct information
but anyway this just this can't be new to you right the internet has got
no no like i said i i've heard it all i've heard it all
and so much of it is out of context and things
where people try and like what the one of the comments in the chat was mormons
believe that all native americans are lost tribes of jews
it's like actually no we don't believe that
okay and if you want to know specifically what we believe and what
connection certain native americans might have
with ancient israelites not jews well you might want to understand the
context of it all instead of putting things out of context
and then presenting it in a more ridiculous fashion which obviously
sounds far more unreasonable because that's the way people like to frame their
statements and yeah it's just a very common vein of
disingenuous argument um oh my okay i'm i'll save this this is
definitely for right oh i was i was talking about
no chat that that's my piece i think yeah i was gonna say if you if you tried
to derail the by i know it's i know i'm just
because i'm shouting it down and then they'll just try and come up with
something different but i've heard it all and it's amazing
the lengths that we will go to yeah uh let's continue gonna do the aiden
thing and have this dream play while i fall asleep wish me good night
also hi rags good night um remember when rags streamed with no
bullshit yes i believe that happened um rags
didn't know him though and didn't know his positions as far as i'm aware
um if rags were here he'd probably say the same thing but i can't say that's
100 but yes he did stream with him we've all we've
all streamed with with with people who we
you know just having a conversation with you don't know everything about
everybody rags did not know he was speaking to one of if not the stupidest
content creator on the platform you know it can happen um
weird question but did any of you work out if so do you have any advice on
home workout equipment my so i go to a gym i don't uh
have home workout equipment but i mean if you got space for a treadmill
probably can't go wrong there maybe weights like freehand sort of
but uh there's gotta be good advice on the internet for stuff like that
like i'm just going off basic understanding of what people do in homes
with with home workout stuff my current job
schedule makes it hard to go to the gym so i'm thinking about converting my
garage into a home gym yeah i could that could go go well
uh like i said uh find some advice online probably
uh this guy is describing something very incorrectly
i'm assuming that's referencing arlo yeah could have been me it's very
possible could have been any of us calling
someone jay makes you jay oh a shay i think that's supposed to be
shad if you know brandon sanderson could you ask him to finish dragon steel
oh yeah i i haven't asked him about that specifically
but i think dragon steel is holding off because that has a lot of
crucial elements to the formation of the cosmere or the nature of the cosmere
and so what happened to adenalsium and where the
shards came from and stuff um there's like a version of dragon steel
available at byu i think because he might have submitted as part of his
master's thesis um but he said he needs to rewrite it as
well um but yeah so i don't dragon steel is
put on his radar anytime soon there's been no reports on that
um ps everyone should sign jay's petition i mean yeah you can find jay's
petition on twitter uh he's trying to get no bullshit to change
his um his picture very very fascinating
endeavor yo was up i mean go ahead i was well yeah
like i said i don't know anything about you know
i'll call in brooks um so again i'm very disconnected from the
whole you know everything that's happening there
but i can't say that changing his profile picture to the guinea pig
wouldn't be an improvement you know because hey the guinea pigs they look
kind of cool just saying you know
uh yo what's up home slices two questions first have you seen the
poison of subjectivism by cs lewis doodle on youtube
if not then do it for doodle um someone sent me that uh i want to say a
couple days ago on twitter and i did watch it it was uh
quite content rich it's a lot of ideas
quickly yeah like i i have seen one of these
videos recommended sorry my my infant son has joined us so you
might hear i'm a bit louder now um i i have to watch any of the movies but i
just was interested by this channel name cs lewis doodle was it like like i'm a
fan of cs lewis but yeah
uh second question if i created 3d models of some of y'all can i
make them do the fook uh i don't i guess everyone might have
different answers to that i think rags are probably like you can do
whatever you want and i probably second that if if that's
what you want to do you know what it's a free country um
hi rags and shad uh if ever you need a portuguese translator for your books hire
me i have three years of experience and i'm
unemployed un bejo grande cheers
i mean uh i don't know did you get your books
translated shad that's something i'm actually going to
be looking at uh soon uh where uh finishing off second edition for
the book and once the second edition is more polished
brandon act like sanderson he actually suggested i approach his own agent
about um a limited u.s print release and that's also where i am
going to be looking at translations um because i can't do it right and
and so agent is perfect for approaching foreign language publishing
groups and then they translate and translate it and
distribute it as well and saying it's on my it's on my radar that's what i'll be
looking at soon um rags has spoken to sargon who has
spoken to ferage if he hasn't himself he knows someone
who has spoken to the queen their uncle spoke to hitler so it's less
than six people between you and adolf oh how about that oh that means you're a
n-word well not that inward the other the other end
the bad man then uh rags wolf mauler which is more retarded
canon wise aliens clonin marines bringing back corporal hicks
or episode nine bringing back palpatine um so the way they do it in clonin
marines is that the body of corporal hicks
in alien three was someone else that's what they say
and from what i understand the rationale for palpatine is either going
to be he simply says he survived which is insane
or yeah that's just retarded i like no or they killed a clone the whole time
that's what was actually happening he was a clone on the
death star with some of the things that you were reading it's
like they're just picking out bull crap from thin air and just making it
and then like force powers can suck youth from another person
when the hell they're making the force into
do whatever they want magic yeah which it's just retarded
i mean if that's what they actually do we're here to see what actually happens
but if they go down that path oh my goodness
and then uh there's yeah i'll dimension like
just the the fact that it seems so uncertain all these different reports
all these different screens they're in damage control maybe
you watch like so if you told me the plot of episode nine back before force
awakens came out i'd be like is this a joke you trying to kill
like destroy star wars what are you doing
like why would you make this so hard on yourself it's so easy to do this
oh i it's it it really feels like whoever's handling the script doesn't
know the correct structure for storytelling and stuff with the amount
of bull crap that they're going back and forth with and things
and i mean
and the very nature of reshoots like i wasn't fully aware how
common they were right and and i heard that
movie stories the actual plot of the story can be
altered at you know in drastic ways to near the very end of production of like
well hang on didn't you like yeah to me as are you
because i'm a writer right that's not how well does not have my
right stories and stuff like that i mean
just uh i just can't understand how they do it yeah
as for which is more crazy canon wise i guess i'll go with episode nine it's
more crazy because
it's kind of they're almost the same neither of them should be alive
but i feel like star wars is gonna break extra things when they do it
corporal heck surviving is like them saying oh there's just a mistake
in transit that sort of thing it's fine while episode nine is gonna have to
break several things in the universe as well
like the idea that we just got this army of
palbiting clones or you can survive the deaths are exploding
he turned over what if they create another force power he teleported
himself off the diet and it'll be so cheap
if they do something like that we're gonna we're gonna see
we're all gonna get our answers in under a month
yeah gee thanks more i did not want to watch this piece of crap
now i feel i have to just to see what happens in this train wreck
like you can talk to us about it eventually
i mean i want to see a review from you shad don't deprive me of such things
no because i'll do something wrong and you'll rip me apart on efap oh because
we never do anything wrong here
um what if instead of god is dead we say god has fallen and he can't get up
i mean maybe he's i'm gonna lie down you don't know that he can't get up
no reason why he can't lie down there are deeper philosophical and
theological implications to this that could take us in the many different
directions so uh that's my thoughts on it ah yes my
favorite show ejap every jab a pause oh yes
jab is a mainstay to admit when you are wrong is to become
correct pretty much um yeah pretty much it's interesting
like because you know um you go through many
kind of phases growing up through life when you get old but i actually you
know kind of remember the process when i was younger
when i realized that hey being wrong isn't so bad but i do remember
before then there was times when it was very hard for me to admit i was wrong
and that was a lot of because of insecurity and i was young and naive
and all that stuff but it's it's kind of a liberating
uplifting thing when you actually are able to
change something inside yourself and say you know being wrong it's not that bad
yeah it's really not gonna last very long like oh no these he's the guy who
admitted he was wrong versus he's the guy who never admits he's wrong
well the other thing is and i like and it's funny people who get
really they dig their heels in and won't admit they're wrong when
you know faced with so much you know contrary evidence
they they seem like they're unaware of something that's quite prominent and
it's the amount of respect people give to people who admit
when they're wrong that they're wrong when they're wrong
and the amount of credibility it actually increases
um for that individual and for people who view it like
it's a it can do good things for you when you do that
if or just in regards to your credibility but
they seem to think that no they're wrong i mean there's no one will ever trust
them again when it's the opposite uh your your
credibility will remain unscathed if you admit you're wrong once you're
presented with the information that's it shad look out kylo lurks
around many toilets waiting for his prey who whispers into the wind
oh dear i might have to shut the door even when i'm alone now
please don't flush brown pointy daddy oh my goodness
uh then the follow-up from this man same person
and different super chat uh words are gay
what do you think of that philosophically i must be a raging homo yeah i was
gonna say you've got a lot of the gay going on in
this podcast if we're here but you know sometimes i just you just
have to that's it you've got to accept that and that's
okay yeah gotta accept a bit of the game it's
2019 uh hi everybody jojo rabbit is great have
any of you seen it have you seen that
jojo rabbit no yeah it's a new tyker ytt film
oh how is it it's about a boy whose imaginary friend
is hitler
isn't that from premise alone you're like i'll watch it
like i would watch because even like it's pushing against the political
correctness there you can't even mention nazis otherwise you're a terrible person
like you know pewdiepie was raked across the
coals because he made some nazi jokes like come off it
and so to see something more mainstream saying nah
up your will uh we'll make jokes about nazi things
it's like okay i think uh the crazier lefty people are actually
okay with the film because it's making fun of nazis completely
um i don't know actually i'd have to check in to see what see what they're
thinking about it um because like the even the nazi
bug kind of stuff right the context of that joke was that
the statement was horrible and bad like and that having a cute dog
responds to it and the juxtaposition and the you know
but and yet people lost their minds over it
yeah no it's very like um interesting how it all works there's so much to uh
study you know like in the lab just like how humans work
with all this stuff um but yeah anyway um so i think at one
point we said jab 2020 and back to back i have these two
super chats from uh two different people bernie 2020 also
high rags trump 2020 high rags so it looks like
we've got a diversity of thought in our chat
yeah i mean i i said i think trump's gonna win
guys just just saying it you know that's that's what it looks like it's going at
the moment and i don't necessarily hate to say
that i i mean i don't like on a personal level just
you know because he's done some pretty jerky things but as a president i've
been surprised about certain policies and how
conservatively you know um he's done things and i am a
conservative so there we go yeah and i i don't know enough about
all of it but um i like the idea that all of every
kind of people is in my chat i really don't mind
yeah like it's so weird to me the amount of hate and
true people have who have different political opinions
and i can see where it comes from and why but it's also so
dumb pointless and stupid as well and it's just a
recipe for disaster in the end as well uh this is why i do
my best to try and keep politics out of my own content i don't know perfectly
it does slip in now and then but for the most part
um because a lot of my content is very one it's apolitical a lot of it isn't
even you know related to politics and i kind of understand that idea that
people aren't watching my content to hear my hot takes or anything like that
they want to learn about swords and i get that and so no matter what
people political you know spectrum they come from they're more than welcome to
enjoy my content and i'm happy and it's funny like i'm very close friends
and family who are so different to me politically like
just polar opposites but guess what you can get along it's not impossible
my goodness and i'll tell you what the discussions we've had
well yeah and i was gonna say like i'm okay with anyone holding any politics in
the chat but there are like there's gonna be ethical and
political positions you could hold that would
i would be you're crying more than likely certain ones
certain here and there you know ones like say for example uh
someone said like you shouldn't be speaking about a film
with a black protagonist if you're white because it's inappropriate i'd be
like yeah you can go yeah i was sorry that's
racist exactly like this this in things you
could say in certain contexts that will make me be like wow
that's a position i think is deplorable but all right
but again i wouldn't say to that person stop watching my content i'd be like you
can carry on i just completely disagree with you
yep um anyone who's 2a out there should currently be stocking up on rifles and
ammunition the boogaloo cometh 2a i'm not sure what 2a is
uh beloved jeb 2020 all right the hills have eyes but the trees
speak vietnamese either way the roofs speak egyptian sun god
also shad isle of man legs as a fantasy monster
i i love man legs so do you know the isle of man flag
i don't oh just google it quickly and you'll have your answer to this question
essentially oh dear you're not baiting me no no no
is a real place it's a real flag it's just an amusing flag
um i have islands isle of man i don't have a flag oh that flag there
okay okay so three legs is it um yeah that
as a monster i reckon it'd be very hard for it to get around
you'd think like we're having three legs but the position of the legs
they're off in such different angles unless they could fully rotate
and then it could like walk on two legs and then have the third leg as kind of
like a as a punchy kind of thing that could
go down and heal people with a reverse bend of the knee
um i'd still think would be mostly ineffective but pretty pretty spooky
seeing that thing right yeah yeah it'd be not be unknowing it's a
it's a it would be it's a creepy kind of thing
also i'm just uh 2a is second amendment
yeah um uh wow it's almost like rage bait pushes likes and retweets and
actions like they've been resulted in our borked media
if that's referencing anita then yes i'm not sure if it is though
because yeah she's she calls misogyny left right and center and it gets her a
spotlight a lot of people because i honestly my
entire timeline like i was seeing all the different
people i follow respond to her and like call her out with being
ridiculous and it is kind of like man this is what she wants i guess
yeah it seems like attention and then uh then she can claim victimhood for all
the attacks that she gets and everything have you seen her channel though it's not
working out yeah she's i like to think of it as
just uh that's the way the cookie crumbles like you don't have anything to
offer nobody stuck around like all the you
know games and content these you know more extreme you know sides
of feminism stuff has been making it's just been dying flat and going
nowhere yeah what does blessed pipeman think of
alo i will hang on to that question i'm gonna
assume you may not even know him but if he does
it'll be neat to get his perspective it's our resident puppet versus the
covered puppet favorite john carpenter movie that
would be the thing for me what about you shad i don't know i
just think of um john carter from mars is that close to
john carpenter can i pick that one no oh i kind of like that movie no you
yeah but it's not john carpenter movie they jump they jump really high
he jumps and then he then he like hits things with a
chain whip and stuff that's nice but it's not allowed in the selection
now you got a couple to choose from i can read them out if you want you got
read them out i see if i see i haven't seen it halloween the original
i see no i hate horrors and so it's very likely i've seen none of them
nope escape from new york oh hang on is that with like kurt russell um
okay all right is there anything else then uh big trouble little china
oh uh i would say escape from new york so far my favorite
um in the mouth of madness i guess that's kind of a horror so
you got to escape from l.a but yeah that's it
yeah and i think that's the main ones most people know so
yeah um like i said i'd still go snake snake bliskin
the thing is like one of my favorite horror movies is so damn good and it
like it's it's one of those ones that can really survive aging
pretty damn well i love those ones um minds prince of darkness close second
is they live for its ending best eldritch horror director oh yeah a
lot of people think he did really well with uh
the lovecraftian elements um in different parts of his movies
um can i tell you about the time i wore blackface
i mean if you want to uh it could be an interesting story i'm not going to be
against it all right uh part of the reason wind
waker had such a negative reception was because of an ad in nintendo power
it looked very adult both style and in gameplay
when the cartoony style came out many consumers felt like they've been lied
or baited and switched with the much better looking ads
i mean yeah i don't have context for any of that but that could be fair yeah
yeah i wouldn't know make no bs the final boss of efap mini
video game why would he be the final boss come on
he's terrible who would you say would be the final boss
first of all like if we transpose this to like mario
i would make um no bullshit the goombas like he's just all of the goombas um
final boss probably
i might want to go with a meme character instead of anyone we've covered
because really yeah like because of all the people we cover like
i mean jenny could be or jenny's like the knights of jen as someone suggested i
thought that was pretty cool yeah she was the most aggressive you know
and you know well she wasn't too aggressive she just tweeted but then
every everyone came for a defense i was gonna say she'd be the kind of boss
where you've got um a really like weak character that can be
killed easily but they're surrounded by so many like units that have decent
armor and attack and it's like a big mob boss sort of fight
yeah as soon as you get to that center and kill it all the knights just
fall apart
there you go i'm done cdi zelda game is the best so
oh i remember that one i remember seeing videos about it it's a very amusing the
cut scenes and stuff on it uh glad you find chaps enjoyed the art
the owl is bubo from the clash of the titans referencing bilbo
and that is its maulers spirit animal oh there you go
great stream as always and shad love you kind of channel and there you go oh
thank you man yes appreciate it sit niggleson very very awesome
art and like i said if you can uh send me over you may have done it already i
haven't checked my emails but um give me the the originals for any of
them i would love to have them so i can uh get them out there for other people
and use them in future uh son of a bitch you guys
started streaming and i'm drunk as fuck what hellish video is on right now
anyways while i'm not looking at wait and why am i not looking at women
well you can't look at women when we don't have women gas or women coverage
i'm so sorry it's a world yeah unbreakable oh whoops rags is
right there hi wags yes wags rags camps uh considering the
story i think this art style fits uh yeah that's another that's what we found
interesting when i found out that the game is
a dream he's like oh narratively seems like it works
um will he explain the secret of mario's jump
somehow i don't think i love the a team and wanted to be mr t
wonder what that uh oh but are you first of all are you black and are you
allowed to want to be mr t i was gonna say that's the guy who said he's got a
blackface story um that's probably what it was
yeah all right uh new game when you're a creature traveling through a labyrinth
avoiding the four dark spirits that seek to consume your soul
and only using the orbs of power can you stay
their wrath oh so what what game is that
i don't know so i'll just say it again i'm going to slowly
uh you're a creature traveling through a labyrinth avoiding the four dark spirits
that seek to consume your soul and only using the orbs of power can you
stay their wrath what do you think that is i don't know
so that sounds very generic fantasy kind of stuff
well okay so this will be my first clue i guess
the idea is that they're describing a game you probably know
in a much more dramatic fashion
hey a game i know it there's no way you don't know this game
oh really oh do you want to do it one more time
uh i'm tired more i'm not gonna be able to ever think of it
um orbs of power i don't know is it a board game video game the biggest
clue is saying avoiding the four dark spirits that seek to consume your soul
four dark spirits labyrinth four enemies
i i can't i don't know the answer is in chat you can see it
it's several they're all they're spamming it away
oh pack i i barely played pac-man at all you don't need to have played it
you should know i didn't even know there were four ghosted i knew there were
ghosts but there was restricted to four wow
sad disappointment chat's gonna be unhappy that you don't know about pac-man
ah i played dnd not pac-man
what okay uh good job shad for episode three
dual video press f well thanks man yeah i saw that one as well
actually i think i'm halfway through it i need to continue it
it was cool to see you know being like this works this works this works it's
like this one dodgy move not much sense there
like there's no it's it feels very unbiased
yeah and um like episode three so like it's really good it's a really good
fight scene um a bit a lot better than a lot of
people have assumed i've found um next one is actually i'm i'm not
going to do a star wars one next uh i'm going to do a classic
um uh princess bride sword fight scene and then i'll go to luke first
parfaita so mix it up a little it was fun watching
the uh the troy one with you when you first came on efab
i like that i'll probably yeah i'll probably do a um
fight scene autopsy of that as well like i'll do all the big you know famous ones
um mola i'd like to discuss this with you
alo so it's treason then pretty much the interesting thing is his video kind of
precludes him from actually responding to us because we've broken his rule
so rip like we tried uh opinion is made up of two parts
subjective what is good objective how well the item meets the standard of what
is good if people agree on the former only
objective judgment is left
um depends on what statement you make i got distracted i have a little toddler
running around it's okay this it was definitely covered in the
oh the the suit is like in and amongst the uh the four hours i think of coverage
we had is definitely covered in the new zelda art style would look good
for a chibi robo remake fair enough robo remake huh
yeah i don't um i don't know i haven't played the game that's a reference to
uh maybe the plastic like feel of link's awakening makes it seem like link is in
a dream wink wink yeah still not in the uncanny valley
territory well he didn't even make that uh
argument but i guess he could have tried it
i mean he said that it was like too
too much like real life or something that should be more surreal which
isn't really that argument but you know he could have explored it
he wasn't defining how he was using the word surreal because
they would just go off the more common definition but it wasn't applying to
accurately to his criticism so yeah
susan sends her regards via free super chat
why thank you susan i'd send back yes what about pizza on pineapple is that
gross oh you imagine a big slice of pineapple
with a pizza on top of it you bite into that that might be heresy times 100
that's like you've entered hell at that point
exactly you're already punished and just it's over
take my free super chat and like it very well
uh it be like it it be if an anime with poor art style but has a good storyline
and good characters in a cool setting but because the art style low quality
makes it bad anime he doesn't know what he's talking about
he seemed to be making the point that um
i don't even know when it came to like art style
you see he went on the thing about adaptations in movies as a comparative
statement for the art styles being adapted when you
adapt a game on somebody who's just like where are you going there was a big
false equivalence as well when he was trying to
make that analogy and compare it to film adaptation versus game adaptation
um because yeah a lot of different things
consider uh also alo is skipping over the fact that the entire game is an
a dream of a creature yeah well bring that up yep uh alo just
talking with buzzwords like his ukulele review also fringy
wouldn't the cute aesthetic work because it gives off this
not what it seems vibe i think so i think honestly just if you had a dream
where everything was plasticky man would it be like wait what
like he's like uh because a lot of the times you have a lot of um leeway and
dreams you wake up and you're like why did i
think that was real they can be bizarre sometimes a lot of fun
i had a dream the other night where my wife was a military fighter pilot and i
told her she's like what this is like and it's just it was just kind of cool
that's the thing uh people talk about like keeping a dream journal and the
only reason i've ever wanted to is because i always forget dreams so
quickly the most bizarre ones and it's almost like you should write
this down just in case it's not only funny to
recant to other friends about how ridiculous it is but also
what if it led to an idea for a story something crazy yeah it's possible
it's possible um this whole video is basically i don't like it
pretty much yeah and i like i said if you just said that'd be fine but it's
when you start to develop the claims that support that
and unfortunately a lot of people will grasp at something whether or not it's
fully defined even for themselves and they'll be like that sounds about right
that's why and you're like you didn't have to tell me why to be honest with
you um if you wanted to be left alone
it's like if you start making claims yeah yeah i get that's exactly right he
started there to go a step further and be more definitive about his
criticism applying it outside of his opinion so
yeah uh what are you guys thoughts regarding the longevity of the star wars
franchise i'm both inclined and disinclined to agree that according to
red letter media its narrative limitations
inhibits sad longevity all right so my hope is that
give it give it five maybe ten years they will scrap
the um sequel trilogy and uh start it all over again
and they might even bring back the expanded universe
and try and go down that route and they might bring a new actor in to try and
play a younger luke skywalker still a bit older from
the jedi but could kind of pick up the storyline
a bit sooner after the events of the last jedi
and much earlier before uh force awakens did
that's my hope i i they just throw it in the bin
and just admit it was trash and let's do it make a do-over
um there's a good chance of that happening i think especially because of
dark fate decanonizing two minute three four or five
it's like this is something that could happen guys it could
hollywood has uh you know um decanonized things all the time
and uh made revamps to try and capitalize on
stuff once more they do that constantly sometimes
successfully sometimes horribly um i was just gonna say i also think they
would do it before giving up on star wars as in like if it was
star wars is too big to just abandon it completely
especially that certain other properties the star wars properties are
being really successful the mandalorian that shows that there is still a
massive audience that wants good star wars they just like
all we need is a good star wars and we will embrace it
like and and love it and watch it okay but give us
crap the trash they've been spitting out
well then of course you're going to get the um
backlash they deserve um think about it if it's all a dream shouldn't it come
off as deceivingly safe like why is it the people on the island so
bent on stopping you from walking like i said his arguments just they're not
gonna work because you can easily make the reverse argument very quickly like
oh it's not surreal because it's plasticky and real it's like oh it's
surreal because it's plasticky and real there you go
like oh you have to go into more depth if you really want that to be concrete
but it's not um and the first thing i'll be thinking
about in my script i'd be like well i'm gonna have to define what surreal is
in order to tell people that it's not reaching the definition of surreal
yep the new zelda game looks like it's all claymation
like wallace and grommet cool yeah i hope it's good that's not that
yeah that can be good or bad it just depends on execution
since i know you'll never watch it google image search love live
ooze us girls and rank them from best to worst in your opinion based on looks
all right just based on the uh the description there is that i'm
gonna stay away from that like the plague i will uh keep that question i'm
gonna google it uh between shows and if it's a safe
thing i will have it and i'll answer it with rags so we can
we can both do the ranking to make sure you got your
your question answered is plastic water still wet
i'm gonna go ahead and assume no plastic water
oi oi lads how do you lot feel about the fast and furious films i haven't bothered
with the new spin-off but i grew up with them
you got a special place in my heart and fast five was a beauty
i've actually mentioned fast and furious on the fap before and i said
they're a heck of a lot of fun they're really bad on a lot of levels
but they're great brainless fun not all of them
they're ones and worse ones um what's the one where they just
drive around the middle of the streets dragging a massive
um steel vaults is that number six four or five what is it six actually i
lose count but that was just such a brainlessly
stupid fun movie and so that's what i think about
the fast they said it's safe i'm i'm sure it could be safe but i'm sure
you'd rather me keep the question for when rags is here as well
um because he'll he'll actually be invested in
the ranking probably uh yeah no fair enough uh i don't really
care about fast and furious i saw the first and second and tokyo drift once i
believe and i wasn't well those those yeah i'll find them the weaker entries
in the franchise it's when they decide uh like
because for number one and two it's like you're trying to be a bit more serious
be a bit more around the racer thing and when they decide to say just stuff
that we're going to make it into a fun heist franchise with lots of fast cars
and stupid you know stunts and stuff it became
a heck of a lot more fun yeah
um
uh yeah i was just going to say that i was never invested really but um
you know they do seem fun from from the trailers
um
this will help me stay sane through the week i hope you have a great week maula
fringy shad and jay and rags i hope you have a great thanksgiving
thanks thank you sir uh it's like two little graphics spread
over too much expectations zeldogannins
uh i am and still a fan of arlo's content but this is the first video i
felt disconnected from his overall point um yeah i think that's fair i
as far as i know he makes good stuff i haven't looked into it myself but
that video wasn't too great it was very confused yeah and even if we
disagreed with a decent amount of a single video that's not a commentary on
his content overall uh yeah he could be a very nice guy and
that's great good content generally and yeah we
we might be able to make it this time around but we are approaching
uh well we were under an hour left of time before the cap now
so this is the third stream in a row that we've hit the cap
as someone who originally played link's awakening on gameboy and is now
watching my baby sister played on switch they've both got great art to offer
yeah i agree from the two i saw i think they're both achieving a lot with
their styles and execution uh preferred mon warfare mode
so mine's domination um i like headquarters as well
and i will put up with team deathmatch but i'm not a huge fan
and you got cyber attack or night matches for me also partial to spec ops
also campaign story versus original mon warfare i still haven't played the
campaign but um i think wolf and rags both said the
campaign was relatively good and also high rags
uh i would say a remake has to have a substantial difference to the original
even if it's only changing the ending so what people will typically say
about a remaster is that you actually kept the original like
code you've changed the graphics um and then it's like what if you alter that
code and then how much do you have to alter the code before it would be
considered remaking it and um there's different terms like
remake versus remaster versus like re
i can there's there's a lot of things and it's complicated what's
how you draw those lines um specifically but i think we all
understand each other when we mostly use these terms
to describe something um yeah honestly every time i hear opinion
my blood boils because people only use it to weasel out of the discussion or
run away from the moment they start losing
um just an opinion guys this thing i've i still say it
it's almost like a tick like i catch myself like i don't need to say that i
just almost get an urge to say it
um but yeah you know i uh i just uh most of the time like if anyone does say it
and you pursue exactly what they mean by it there's often going to be a better
choice of uh words they could have used anyway but i think we've all
culturally uh come to a point where whenever we want to say something that
we want to signal to other people that we don't necessarily want
challenged or we we don't want to commit ourselves to in a
sense there's like a truth that we can defend
we will often say it's in my opinion it's funny because like i use that
phrase more generally to uh kind of um
give forewarning that i'm about to say something that's subjective therefore
it's my opinion and i'm not stating this as a hard
objective fact uh yeah so that's just my use of it yeah i
think that's fair it's uh the clarity of knowing exactly
what you mean by the word because this is the thing this is one of those words
where everybody assumes that we've all got the same definition
but we really don't and uh a lot of different people have a lot of
different ways of breaking it down so they get frustrated when they're like
why are you criticizing this word it means this and it's like oh it does
yeah it's especially applicable with my more historical
based content because i want to try and make a
clear distinction between the historical facts i'm sharing that i've
been able to get far more confirmation on
versus certain interpretations and opinions i have
of that period that aren't nearly as evidence-based
but still has good grounding for me that you know i have the opinion i have
but it's still more based on you know my kind of uh
interpretation of that period and you know direct fact as well and so i use it
in that distinction
uh also slight bit of hindsight the game ran 15 fps
uh i'm not sure if that does or doesn't support
a statement that someone said or didn't say i can't remember
um you're enjoying art wrong oh yes wait for someone to make that
statement since youtube gives me free cash take it long man and friends thank
you very much oh how nice uh so how do you guys feel
about all the backlash the robot head is getting for his views on mandalorian
he's been getting a big bucket of salt getting thrown at him in his comments
um well i don't want to spoil anything hopefully we're going to discuss all of
that on the next podcast actually um if we don't
really what day in time sorry what day in time this is ozzy so
it'll probably be a repeat of what we did today actually
oh okay are you trying to imply you'd like to be there
maybe maybe i'm gonna check my schedule but i do enjoy the
all these efap things and i like robot head and i reckon it's pretty awesome of
him being willing to review like his own video in the efap stuff
that won't be the easiest thing to do uh especially if
we do have criticisms to levy like it'll be tough but i mean if you know i
also think that we'll have i'm i'm definitely gonna make a point to
compliment his editing because i really like his videos um
and hey i've got criticism as a mandalorian as well
so um yeah but no promises yet we're we'll have to see if it's possible
um oh my god he's made 0.600 times now we get it already yeah arlo repeated
himself many times with the whole especially
towards the end wow yeah this is why if it was scripted i
don't believe for a second that he redrafted it
i think that most people when redrafting something like that would
definitely pick up it's it's interesting how that can work um i
i don't know if you get this as well uh maybe with the books or not but um
when i'm redrafted some of my work i'll be like how did i think that was
good to say like i've got this here and this here like you get um
almost like what feels like a bird's eye view as opposed to the first person
perspective when you're writing it when you come back to it
you can see a different view in a way yeah yeah the revision process can be a
very long arduous thing especially with a book
um and so uh for me it can be difficult to actually get a
bird's eye kind of distance perspective on many things that's when you need beta
reader feedback it's crucial because that's where you get the
you know um the uh kind of separated more
hard opinions like no this is terrible just but
it's not fitting right um it's like when you and when often when it's pointed
after you like oh okay there you go
um i genuinely want to pick up a switch now because this game looks so nice i do
not understand this argument one bit yeah i'm
i would genuinely happily have him on to discuss this topic and it would take i
would actually warn him i'd be like you do get the discussing the nature of
opinions is not something we can crack out in five
minutes right put aside six hours at least
gonna take a while but i mean i yeah like a lot of creators
when they get invited or or asked to be on efab and then they're like wait how
long is it and it's like well um it's always awkward because i'm
like are you like you're able to be free
when you first invited me i had no idea how long efap was right
and so i was like yeah okay hour or so standard
length and when we went for three hours i was like all right i better hop off
because i'm taking i'm taking making these guys go way too
long oh you didn't realize that we were the
longest no not even up to that point right and
then when it was on mooler and i started reading comments people like
wow you guys are not you know step up this thing's a short efap i'm like
what the hell that's short we principally me and rags as content
creators and i i don't know if you feel this way as well but we're just
like it takes as long as it takes there is no
it has to be this short um yeah well that's the same with my video there's a
couple of smaller guidelines i'll use so say for example you'll be like wait so
why don't you just put your entire tfa series into one video i'd be like well
for one i'd like to actually be able to have
completed pieces as i go instead of being like it's not
actually ready for anything until i get every part done it's kind of daunting
but also i'm trying to split up into what could be considered
movie length um for an entity piece of content i think is reasonable to use
that as a sort of an average gauge of how long someone may
spend on a video not like it could be a six hour video i
could probably get away with it i'm just saying that like it seems to make
sense to me that that would be a neat cap to have
um what was the neat cap again it's like movie length average movie so what i'm
gunning for is like two to three hours but even that is quite a long movie
typically hmm it is um but yeah and that's
perfectly fine well i was gonna say this isn't about the podcast so the podcasts
are completely unfiltered and unhinged we go for as long as
going goes i don't like to be like the idea that
because you get some podcasts are just like
almost waiting for the timer to complete and i think that's when you know
the podcast is running out of steam and it's like we're gonna it looks like it's
not meant to be sort of thing like efap is utterly insane we've had
three 11 and a half plus hour podcasts in a row
and we're not finished at each of them i know it's great and
is there any other podcast that even comes close well this is it's not i
don't think so but like there's a reason for that it's that this is insane
you don't do this nobody recommends this this is insane and you just be like well
maybe we'll change the face of podcasts to a degree with this but like i think
any normal person in any walk of life would just be like how
could you have that long of a podcast that doesn't make sense
but hey you know it works out for a lot of people out there i know like i think
the answer would be is like how long can you hang out with your mates
well there's your answer you know well i i think
that's kind of a proof of chemistry for this show that me and rags can go for
like 30 hours and we're still fine we're just
like yeah still going
hi ivan hahaha i did the rags thing i see his name is ivan
so he said hi ivan to himself not bad indeed that's how the high rags meme
got started he sent a super chat to himself saying hi rags
that's the origin people can't stop saying hi rags but that's fine
that's glorious um okay i have to bring this up mauler an observation
is not an opinion an opinion would be how it affects the enjoyment of the scene
i disagree um an opinion by definition of how i
use it as judgment an observation is not a judgment wouldn't
necessarily follow you you can create a judgment based on
all kinds of different um pieces of information
so yeah i mean an observation is uh what you know the uh
thoughts you have on assessing something that you're observing
and uh but you don't know if they're definitively true
and anyway and the thing is like uh you can have that definition of opinion i'm
not actually going to stop anyone from that because it's very
that way it is used in all over the but i'm not going to say there's more of a
definitive use of it however my definition of it encompasses
yours and an additional one so what i mean by that is if someone says
it's my opinion that i feel this way i'd be like yeah
so if an opinion isn't a judgment and a judgment can be
i've enjoyed this thing and from that information i can determine that this is
something i like i'd be like that was a judgment it was
entirely based on subjective experience to make a subjective claim like that's
fine with me that makes sense that follows through
um yeah and i also think uh i think the word opinion is used in that context
even by people trying to narrow the definition
i then extrapolate though that if my judgment is
you know daniel craig is currently james bond based on this information that's
my judgment you'd be like well yeah that's a that that would be a
judgment you've made i suppose and you'd be like yeah so by
definition it's also an opinion it's not a very um the problem with it
is that you just be like would people really use it that way and
it's like not really but the ones you do use are stuff
like um you know luke is behaving
inconsistently and then they'd be like that's just your opinion
might be like yeah it's an opinion but it's objective it's based on
information that can't be denied so uh that's that's received from the text
it's got nothing to do with my personal feelings
and uh you know it gets complicated then and so you might be like that one just
will count i'd be like okay let's get something more
more agreeable it's my opinion that uh the disappearing knife in the throne room
fight damages uh that entire sequence in terms
of the stakes you'd be like that's just how you feel
i'd be like no no no stakes can actually be quantified like we can look at
the power level of each character's involved and how they're dealing with
stuff and if i find out the fucking knives can disappear the
plot can literally wrap itself around ray and protect her by disappearing
weapons that's crazy man it's so funny that it
happened to ray of all people like the one character that's under so
much scrutiny for being a mary sue
fantastic i think she's taken over as the face of mary sue now and like
literary understandings and stuff she might be
she might become the new default example now
a lot of people are unhappy with that but um from what i've found
if anyone disproves the concept of her being a mary sue it'll be based on
very very harsh uh standards about what a mary sue is
and that she doesn't uh literally meet them and i think that that it does a
disservice to the label i'd be like we know what the label's
meant to imply as a shorthand right yeah and so if she doesn't
satisfy every single uh checkbox in relation to what a mary
sue was originally defined as by its original
word usage i'd just be like yeah okay even if we agree with that it doesn't
make her a strong character but like even if someone wants to be
that pedantic to try and say the original meaning of
word was something different it's not how the language has evolved
and i find it interesting the same concept applies to the word macguffin
um people use macguffin now really more synonymously
with the plot device um when officially macguffin and i made a
whole video on this because people try pulled me up on it i was like okay
officially macguffin does mean something far more specific
um but with mary sue i think it's like far more widely accepted to have
a more common use in language that's nowhere near as
pedantic as people much sad is um but yeah that's why uh
that's my understanding of the weird opinion how i use it
and if someone else tells me that's not what opinion means i'm like so in that
case thing would you do me the favor of saying
i feel instead of this is my opinion about something is actually shorter
anyway and then if you are you better follow up
with what's a feeling instead of something that's definitely not
when you make claims like uh i feel like the knife disappearing doesn't
affect the stakes i'd be like
doesn't follow
hello again guys i want to make videos i've been wanting to make videos for a
long time years in fact uh i have ideas but i lack the
motivation it sucks any advice
just do it yeah that's tough um because every single person is
going to have a different thing that will motivate them
yeah for me right i i that's literally it i
needed to find something that got me in the mood and mindset and i'm referring
to my writing in this instance right um i've to begin with i found it really
hard to get into the mindset uh in the mood to write until i
realize that listening to how to write you know videos and stuff
motivated me and got me kind of psyched to actually start
putting pen to paper and so what i did i literally started listening to writing
you know videos and stuff every morning um
to get me in the mood to write and so if you find whatever motivates you
realize i've got identify it and then use it to your advantage
that was something that helped me for me um
the difference between not making videos and then making them was i was watching
a channel whose style i really fell in love with
and then um i adopted portions of it as well as portions of plankett and
portions of um uh a hoy uh there's a bunch of
people i was trying to amalgamate and then and then it's created my own thing
now but um yeah i really like the way they
were explaining stuff and the way that they edited
and i was like man i kind of i not only do i think i can sort of do it but i
also would like to create something that i
think is that good and then also um it was soma getting
either nobody review it or people are reviewing it didn't understand the game
at all and they were like it's it's pretty bad
the story is pretty bad it's long it's annoying and i was like okay
i really want to talk about this game and explain what i thought was amazing
about it and um and then that's that's what that
got made and then immediately after finishing it um
people were like what do you think of you must love outlast then i think that
was like a conclusion or whatever and i was like why i hate outlast and they
were like oh whoa you hate outlast and i was like okay well maybe not
you know i'll just make a video and explain it and then i did
and then i played ds1 and loved it ds2 hated it and i was just like god that
game was terrible and played ds3 and loved it i think anyway this is the
timeline then h bomb a guy came out with a video saying that um ds2 is like a
masterpiece of kinds and i was like this video is filled with inaccuracies
and it's driving me nuts and i also want to expel how much i
wasted my time on ds2 and so that's what created that series what i'm getting at
here is that like i didn't know that those things were
going to motivate me to make the videos you know what i mean but they did
and so like what how do you advise someone on that and it's like um
i guess the easiest way is to just maybe try and figure out what's not being
said that you think could be uh stick to the things that you know you
have your your heart stuck in maybe try and experiment with video
editing even though you don't intend to make the video and just see if there's
anything that you're like you know what this is possible
there's so many different things and like we've had people who watch efaps
say that like it's inspired them to want to make videos right i think i've read
some out today possibly um that might not work for someone it
might be more than enough to work for someone
it's uh i don't know what exactly is going to work for you but i
i hope you get there or whatever it is you need because i don't want to pretend
like i have the answer because it's uh it's going to be really complicated and
it's different for everybody
yeah moving on um in my opinion a complaint is solely by the speaker's
point of view and if it bothered them regardless of if you agree or not
don't at me though i just uh i liked what uh rags
read out as the definition of it but i didn't even it felt like a weird tangent
talking about the definition of complaint
and the way that he was describing what makes him really strange
and it really seemed like you're saying that because people were
telling him to stop complaining and again i'm doing the terrible thing he
said don't do stop trying to assume people's motives
and stuff but that's what it really felt like he just
can't avoid it um same point worded so many ways lul
hi rags yes he well it's sometimes it wasn't even worded in different ways
he just said the same thing again we were like oh god
yeah um i think it's time arlo commit suicide right rah hey commit i get it
very clever uh this video makes me want to swan dive into an empty bathtub at
the top of rah's tallest roof also i'll bet you
can't say i bet you can't say sagging backwards
yeah that's that's not a wise thing to do on youtube you see
get in all of the troubles even though jay longbun gets away with it fine
this is the thing i'm pretty sure that youtube will ban people for using
those words but in certain contexts i think more so than others but also
um i'm pretty sure if if you're black you can actually
get away with it no matter what i'm not sure that you can get in trouble
because like a lot of people were uh jay longbun says it a bunch on
this on this podcast but i was like i don't think we'll be in trouble
she's allowed to say it right by youtube rules i don't know how this works
she's got the pass i mean we joke about it but it's like yeah i'm pretty sure
that they would be in trouble if she was told she's not allowed to say it
uh from different perspectives and stuff so it's like yeah whatever
but um you know there's a context for it all i believe
there's even news reports where they've um they've used it and people
there's this hot debate even if it's in reference or a quote
they'll people will be like you shouldn't be saying it whatsoever
oh yeah there was this one clip of uh an interview on
probably cnn where someone quoted someone by saying he said and then he
says the the word in the host was like i i can't believe someone said that
nor has she cut something
forcing an opinion would be like not allowing someone into a friend circle
unless you agree with them the thing about that is though they might
just agree with it on the surface i would also include torture you know
torturing someone in levels they agree yeah yours is a much more forceful
example we are forcing someone to yeah forcing an opinion
um but what if what i want to do is force my opinion on others i thought you
said live by you do you i'm sure you would say you do you
uh unless it inflicts on other people doing
you you know i mean you you could eat like a whole bunch
of opinionated papers that gave you constipation
and then when you're forcing it out well you could say you're forcing an
opinion that they yes yep um i got i got the deep stuff now
i nailed it i'm very tired myself um a summary of the last 10 minutes don't
complain about my opinion but you can have an opinion but don't force it on me
while i force mine on you
shad said n words have opinions the council of color and i have convened and
decided shad is the ceo of racism hang on what did i say shad said n words
have opinions i don't know exactly what's referencing i just like the idea
that you're the ceo of racism nice job man all right okay how well does that
pay i've heard it's not so bad well i mean they'd actually try and take
your pay by getting you blacklisted and stuff so
yeah cancel coaching yeah i know i mean but you know as long as you get maybe a
few years in you can save you know it'll work out relatively
so yes ceo there's no going up from there man
nice job thanks um
here we go i thought you do you meant go screw yourself
technically look at the wids i mean i ain't saying it doesn't say that oh it's over thank
the dawn oh there we go we're at the point in super chats where we finished the arlo video
look how far we've come shad i've noticed some super chat being dropped not long ago so
we always defeat it eventually we will catch up we're uh we've made some good progress on this
efap uh the fourth matrix movie jk rowing reveals that neo was gay all along also blade
did the trench coats and shades before neo neo copied don't at me so jk rolling reviewed
well she's doing the thing she's been doing that with her characters in harry potter right
oh yeah with that yep your brother was just like they used to magic out their poop
no the thing was like what did they do where they didn't have toilets or something like that
it was like oh they could magic out their poop like what what's happening the old story like
magic did it because reasons um rags moolard shad what are your massive opinions on the
mandalorian is it worth its weight in rhino milk or should i be sailing the seven seas
ah definitely worth its weight in rhino milk i would say wait um until the full season's out
yes that's true good good point we will be able to give you a stronger perspective on whether or
not those seven seas should be sailed mandalorian is the first piece of star wars media that's made
me genuinely smile hope it continues being good hi rags hi shad blessed be the dawn hello and i
hope so too as do i i really want good star wars content you don't know how much it's like
water in a desert that was just cool
efab is a podcast about long wizards intended for children no no it can't be intended for
children we'll be fined 40 000 no on that um i like to bvs more than the noland movies because
i had kryptonite and i like things with good rocks don't at me though oh the rock thing
is that is all meant to say this two efaps ago all right well you got it out eventually
not bad well done well done sir uh just popped to need to rewind great to see shad there you go shad
appreciate yeah i feel appreciated oh check out this this so about the whole philosophical
discussions uh i think this is very relevant this one says art is gay
well all right then complicated uh yoshiklij joshikage kira got an erection from the mona lisa
okay uh maybe so does that mean taiwan lannister is the greatest work of art of all time
why hang on am i getting wrong lannister which which lannister is the apex homo
oh yeah that is sorry taiwan ah i was right um oh yeah well yeah sorry in reference to the art
question yeah yeah he'd be he'd be one of the best people greatest work of art ever um as a glass
artist i have learned the value of art is determined by collectors if someone is willing to pay then
that's how much it is worth i mean obviously in terms of how much money it's worth it'll be
basically based on what people are valuing them the money monetary worth out what they're willing
to pay sure i was wrong to say value we quickly corrected that to quality so yeah value is another
word that gets complicated because yeah i mean you know i don't want to go too far into it because
i'm going to try and push to get as many of these we can in the 30 minutes 40 minutes less than 40
minutes all right we can do it we might be able to do this if i go a little faster did you guys
ever play star wars bounty hunter game with the early 2000s thoughts i really like it um i want
to play it again because i'm pro it's probably not as good as i remember it being but uh i had a lot
of fun with it and it made me appreciate jango fett as a character a lot more um natural i didn't
play that one played nights at the old republic of course love those uh classic ones and the new
styles game by ea is getting good reviews i've got my own right now yeah all right that's fine i need
to play more of that i will also high rags and shad hi the value is based on the consumer while
the quality of art is objective based i agree i can happily agree with that for now in terms of
the value like i said monetary value for sure
i can't believe how expensive some of this art crap is it's unbelievable stuff my one
two-year-old could do and it's worth billions i can't stand that every time every time i see
patrick williams i regret that i gave up my training with the noose not for my neck i've
grown an immunity also high wags and kick j a strange super chat i guess it's saying that he
cannot kill himself via the noose and he wish he could now that he sees patrick williams i think
i'm following um all right get evan on asap for the episode nine and orphan questions oh we'll
have him on um i might try and fix it so that i can get him and south prawns i know they know
each other and uh it could work out and we'll we'll talk some star wars or whatever else
um high rags i have a dumb question oh all right i will save you
damn it i never got notified you guys were live until five hours in i will catch the stream
tomorrow love the idea that like i didn't get notified until five hours later and i've missed
less than half of the podcast um what are you some kind of big brain or something yeah
big brain big hair big gut big everything quote from kra the sea monster 1998
sounds great good quote um there's nut on an arcade game a chuck e cheeses
i do not know what to make of that one that's a mystery reason is axiomatic because to argue
against it you have to use reason yeah yeah i'm happy with that um i just watched all three episodes
of the mandalorian you guys are still go that's not that doesn't count the three episodes of the
mandalorian is like an hour and a half it's not that long if you had said you watched all three
lord the rigs extended editions i would be like okay yeah that's uh it's kind of funny yeah i don't
think that's possible though because the cap is 11 45 55 sorry so um hard counter to solipsism
argument if i do not exist then why do you argue against me what's the point
um couldn't they could make up any reason they want for that couldn't they yeah um for the fun
i can't remember when that would relate to what we were talking about
yeah obviously i might not even be answering that properly considering i might be missing
the context there uh shad would an eight foot tall man with superhuman strength
wield a great sword as if it were a long sword
there are interesting things to try and analyze eight foot isn't too much of an increase than
normal so i i don't think the square cube law would have too many detrimental things and perhaps
they could maintain the same range of motion and speed as a regular person and if that was the case
well it actually depends on what strength ratio increase would happen because they would have
more weight to support and so more of their strength that actually go to supporting the
additional weight but again eight foot isn't that much of an increase so i will say yes i think so
hmm and uh i said would they wield a long sword as if it were a bastard sword
yeah or eight foot tall yeah i'd say that's about fair i mean given that they have the
right strength requirement to offset it yeah um this says to sup my reggan i have a feeling i
know that's backwards uh seen joker four times when joker is being called to be on the show i'm
pretty sure his master baiting in the back the only thing that makes him happy now i don't get
how this movies are rated probably the scene where he stabs the person in the neck several
times with the scissors i imagine that's what might have been that maybe just maybe several
extra shots into murray probably made them go oof uh what is the policy on elevator music is it
only used for wolfish's rag arguments or is it something else may the zombie with you i did
specify that earlier i think it's saved for when the argument almost comes out of nowhere
in its nonsense gold and get kind of hilarious in between two people usually typically speaking
i try and if i'm not in the argument then um uh it's better much better than if i am because
it kind of it seems kind of weird then we had the one time when me and rags were arguing and wolf
tried to play it through his own headset and it came out horribly um so yeah it's this specific
requirements is complicated uh thank you for always keeping it long and uncut i was wondering
if any of you massifs had an opinion on captain christian and send my love to wags i don't know
who that is me neither it might be one of the there's a couple of comic books that are very
christian you know based and might be one of those but i i don't know uh it was spelled the
k the christian i think okay uh objectively the subjective is the big gay also high rags
bigidious second book of the dawn oh that's a quote see yeah directly from bigidious bigidious
how did you get that what's difference between luke pulling his saber to him without seeing that
trick versus ray doing a mind trick without seeing it hate tlj just wondering high rags
so one is clearly more i'll let you go i was just gonna say luke has explained the basic concept of
the force and in that it's in everything to a degree like it's all there's lots of uh rhetoric
or well i guess explanation that obi-wan gives that could lead you to understand at least variations
of how this thing will work but the key thing for me is that luke is already reaching for it like
he's he's just trying to get at it anyway and that the um the idea that the force goes beyond
the physical there's a lot of um implication for this is desperation like the fact that okay so
the idea that something is very close to you but just out of reach you may try to go for it anyway
and there's a good chance that if the force is a real thing you might start to feel something
that you weren't actually going for if you know what i mean and then you're like wait
let me really concentrate because something's happening here and i know the force is a thing
as opposed to ray who just decides that she can mind control like mind trick like when
and she doesn't fail in her attempts luke actually tries a few times might be he tries really hard
one time doesn't do it and then has to kind of calm down and refocus try again and so it's shown
that luke is actually struggling more and it's more difficult for him to pull it off and on top
of that there's a whole new like like this is a second movie there's been a big gap of time
between the first movie and this one and which it is it's kind of very evident that luke has been
trying to practice with the force between that because it started with you know obi one giving
him pointers and then in figuring you know trust instincts luke you know the end of the first movie
and so it's quite evident that it was being practicing through that time and that's a much
longer period of time with ray she's introduced in that movie and in that movie before she really
even knows what force is and what it can do and what it could do and what her capacity is for it
bang she can suddenly force mind people and like whoa all right she fails the first attempt so
there you go did she yeah she tries it once and then he says something like i'll tighten your
restraints ah okay my bad anyway luke struggles more it's more no i don't even care the fact that
she struggles to achieve it the first time in some of the second because there's just no through
line i don't understand how she just decided that was a thing she could do where did that come from
yeah did she have any indicate in inclination that she was force sensitive to begin with
i'm trying to i'd have to think back on the scenes exactly my brain is a little bit melty
right now i can't remember any uh any clue that she was you know forced stuff but me in the chat
if i'm wrong a little bit up to that point i really don't think so
i think there's the right oh maybe her mind meld with um kylo she starts to read his mind in reverse
like he see this is what i think that they could have done is have kylo give her mind control
commands and she's like what are you doing and he's like confused he's like like this has no
effect on you and he's like uh that's you know like the only way this wouldn't affect you
is but basically just have him perform the move and so that even then i'd say that would be way
too quick for her to pick up because that's you see it's implied that's a pretty advanced
force ability yeah but at least you'd be aware of it you'd be like okay um
um kylo gets yeeted down a pit but patrick willam survives shake my head fuck this timeline also
hi wags invite jay so we can kick him and hello all my n-words yeah i i agree with all of that
110 um yeah also just to echo what you said i really don't want to understate how much the
gap in the films really helps the believability of it yeah like think of what you could possibly
learn if you have access to the force and even even being alone just testing testing testing
testing experimenting trying all this stuff just like you have to give some leeway that something's
going to have happened um efap's not ending right everything will be okay i'm afraid we will be
ending in under 30 minutes now uh good night your massives guys why are we talking about efap 61
efap 62 is on yes that's true uh so if you guys are accused as alt right but also alt left does
that make you alt middle hashtag alt middle after all it's the best part whole middle yeah i mean
yeah we are all right centrists hey there we go alt middle that's the that's the we can just knew
we are the alt middle the extreme middle eagles were isolationist even gandalf couldn't get their
aid at times also the idea was to destroy the ring in secret and the eagles would give it away
all right so first of all gandalf couldn't get their aid at times that is not translated in the
films no it's not um and the idea was to destroy the ring in secret and the eagles would give it
away i mean how how are you flying toward mordor the idea is that they would be spotted
couldn't they fly really high up yeah i we kind of addressed there's a lot of ways they
could have flown and uh gone unnoticed all i'm saying short little trips is that i feel like
the ideas weren't addressed by the characters in a satisfactory manner i would have loved it if you
had an aggressive point from el rondo gandalf about how these eagles are not our toys and that
um you know something to imply that they have their own sort of ideas and civilization that
they don't the gandalf it's just some some stuff because it's such a such a thing that just makes
you go well if we're gonna point out things that don't exactly work perfectly in lord of the rings
i get annoyed with the inconsistency of gandalf's magic that's one of my pet peeves magic system is
pros possibly the biggest flaw of the lord of the rings the magic system is very unclear yeah i mean
gandalf has shown that he can heat up people's blade so they have to drop it and that is
deflected arrows and he's made energy shields that's protecting him from battle rogs and all
these really cool things that he only uses once they're all one-offs and like when it comes to
the point where it'd be really useful when it's like fighting the lich king or something like that
you're like gandalf you have some stuff up your sleeve let alone the hobbit movie is what they
established gandalf can do and then that just ruins it even further yeah even wolf has said
that lord of the rings magic system is not strong however and that's the thing it can be
you can make magic systems that are much more restricted and understandable um ask rags the
use figuratively for literally question i can do that i don't know that he'll be on board
considering how much he despises people who use literally to me not literally it's like he like
he was uh we had a guy come on who we had covered and he used it in a sentence and like i think rags
like bit his head off and he's like why are you so angry but he's like just don't use that that way
for dawn's sake cover houston productions one and brown table tlj videos it's luke
height a tyler and himla came back from the death and denied the hollow hall hall oh cost yes
um yeah we can you know the possibilities we still gotta do shawn's tlj video and jenny's one
we got so much to do guys so much to do uh why is land why is lando's daughter not half millennium
falcon i don't think that's how it works
uh objectively the best scooby-doo is the robot chicken special and the one with john cena saving
them from the boulder trap i haven't seen it haven't seen any there's a good chance that's true
though shad awaiting your coverage of duku versus anakin and obi one in both episodes two and three
duku with limited appearances had a better narrative than snoke oh agreed that i would
like to do it but there's a couple more larger scale and more kind of you know fights that have
a bigger presence in pop culture that i want to cover before doing one that are a bit more smaller
on the scale like it i i think um da mall versus obi one and qui gon is going to be well before
duku and anakin and the unfortunate thing is i did take a brief small little you know look at
the daft mole one with from an objective standpoint really breaking down and wow
obi one is doing some really bad spins there is looking good for the review sorry guys
like he was doing good really good spins in um the fight on mustafa we're against anakin
but they didn't really have that in their first movie to buy a look of it um and yeah i was just
more saying that duku is way better as like an established character than snoke oh yeah by far
well and yeah i quite like the uh the fight in episode three with duku um but yeah these are
all things that i'd be like well shad tell me how well they did um i take it back the johnny
bravo scooby-doo episode was the best all right uh kiwi farms documents and laughs at internet
weirdos one of the last bastions of free internet left out there lots of doctors as a consequence
laughs at internet weirdos i'm assuming i'm an internet weirdo damn i'm okay with this me too
hmm high rags uh rah can destroy diabeto by roofing him at mustafa yeah that seems to be
the narrative right now that's where he would do it uh please do an ephab where batman eats
toothpaste that's the okay more quests uh shadow bursty and vice don 2020 jab bin zim will rise
wait does this mean that you'll be president and the don will be your vice president
oh hey that'll be a pleasure and a privilege yeah i'm all right with this yeah uh i'm drunk
and ordering tacos lol that's all hi rag okay tacos i love tacos um yeah uh i'm fallen order
illam jedi crystal geode home world is confirmed star killer base under the nose of both the
republic and luke's jedi order thoughts oh i'm assuming that's uh some some lore from the game
um yeah i mean i'll be interested to see what the game offers about stuff like that
suggestion i hate cycle a base yeah i hate it too it's ridiculous um suggestion free
fat movies machete one and two fun stuff have you seen any of the either of them
no they made a second one they did it's called machete kills
all right yeah okay ridiculous films but again lots of fun you can get from them
j this is the frozen machete not a petition
that's how wait that's where we're at with the super chassis we can't because i feel like we're
actually getting kind of close here but yet 20 minutes remaining i'll keep on going movie bob
is type 15 diabetic oh i did not know that um how much would you guys pay to watch episode
nine with a crying trailer guy oh i mean i don't know because that would be frustrating probably
because he would be crying throughout the whole film about how amazing everything is
i don't know if i like i'd get bored and i'd be like i don't want to leave now i don't know
how much i'd pay for that probably wouldn't i just be like i'm good i can imagine it
you can only put up with so much yes um after my fourth super chat on the subject watch
hardcore henry dumbos we will get around to it sure of it birthday time this one's for rag
all right uh much birthday messages this one's for mutually thank you and this one's for shad
oh by the way i'm getting an english bill can't wait to start practicing hema
oh nice english bill hook a very classic icon weapon used by the more common soldiers and stuff
good stuff man made i made a video on it recently actually uh alex from i hate everything just a
two-faced disingenuous liar i wouldn't go that far he's a little bit clumsy with how he talks about
things that have happened i'd like to believe that he's made a few mistakes in regards to like
recanting things that have happened between him and any of the efap people but um he's also a
little shy and getting him to like come on here or talk about things is very difficult but um he
does seem a little bitter as well at certain times and i it could make him look that way we
weren't impressed the last time we looked at what he had said about uh different things out of his
podcast but um i don't know if i go as far as saying he's a disingenuous liar it's like
it's a tough claim but there's evidence that could point that way for sure
um i would touch wags's map
oh i'm sure you'd be okay with that depending on the person um chris's film really comes to show
how little he understands film he's become the same arrogant tone deaf director he thought he
was fighting against you know about this hang on chris stuckman is this film out
i did not know this yeah the short film is uh available is it good well we've got a video on it
do you so if you it's only 20 minutes the the original if you watch that you can watch our
coverage and see what we thought all righty um i wonder if you've seen has been hotel is not great
review and has been hotel review response by p.k russell basically a guy did a bad review of
an adult cartoon but his defense was reviews a subjective oh of course he did yeah you can't
get anything wrong hey um birthday money this one's for jay i request a special polite asking
of him to leave well see he left before we could do that what do you want from me don't do anything
okay hi to request an asking of jay to leave invite jay so we can kick him only allow jay
back on stream if he can defeat diabeto in mortal combat use my noose also high wags
and this one's from my favorite green plague man frogled please amputate my legs so i don't have
to work anymore yay oh people are going to the extremes man if you say so yeah i got some
swords that'll help in that yeah that's true uh all right um a big f for those of us on discord
last night who attempted to read movie bob's first book yes there's more i think i almost fell into a
coma has he written a book he's written several has he there's some of this really weird he
apparently compared mario brothers three to nine eleven oh so they're not they're what in like
review books they're not i don't think so like what you could call reviews combined with like
memoirs it's really weird um i don't know i did look into it but yeah uh movie bob's one of the
most unique human beings on this planet in a bad way okay i saw shawn stream of fallen order and
he's genuinely terrible at what he does it's three hours of dead air and small comments about the
game also high rug yeah that's the thing um i think shawn would be another example of a person
who in the videos seems like could be confident could be uh personable and get along well but then
you meet them in real life and they're probably someone who talks barely at all and uh likes to
avoid sort of maybe a social environment he does like i'm just saying it seems that way from what
i've seen in his videos but i i could be very wrong um the personality in the video isn't always
the personality that you get in a like a live setting i guess can be complicated uh good evening
fellow incels and hello rags wanted to ask how to get a meme on efap thoughts on jojo rabbit
not seen it neither is shad but we both hopefully will eventually and the memes are best sent
through the the discord twitter or the subreddit i try and keep track of the lot i can only do so
much sorry if i miss it um matt smith is a young clone of the emperor why don't know
oh is that the actor they get to what i don't know it might be matt smith like dr who yep oh
oh sorry i'm sorry
um as a as a willy the flutes are the objectively inferior genital slang
all right yeah his name is william so he would know um
i'll boost myself a little bit apparently i'm sounding a bit quiet i think it's because i am
fighting the urge to sleep uh long roof is one of my favorite ancient scholars
make sense have you guys watched taxon's video on rags if so are you planning on responding seems
like he has more than a few tism he takes he's gonna have to wait oh gee sorry um it's gonna
take some time for us to get through a lot i've got a lot of efaps planned i mean it's funny this
was a planned efap to have shad on to talk about this video and as a result this one we've got a
new one planned now for that other video so and it all goes into this big selection i've
got and it's tough because i'm also trying to evolve new guests and the thing is like we
i've said this before we didn't cover the tro video on uh rags for like i want to say half a
year or something it was it was a long time and we only covered it because enough people thought
that there was good arguments in the video who were fans of ours and we were like all right let's
tackle it and it was awful so if enough people were to say something like that or if a narrative
was fun that it's like this this destroys rags then yeah we'd be more rushed about it but it's
just it's such a bad video um the arguments are so thin and the conclusion by the way is that rags
is the worst youtuber on the platform and like yeah you laugh because you're like oh come on
you can dislike it but the worst come on so yeah we don't take it that seriously but you know
i'm not going to say it's impossible but i have been getting the impression
that it's a little bit of a feed the troll scenario uh taxon's been very invested in
plugging and chipping away at efap whenever possible and uh i'm getting the impression that
it's to boost the old channel instead of actually addressing uh issues and stuff
anyway kicking on uh take some cash my g's and have a good thanksgiving hi very much
uh hi rags i hope i haven't acted too much of a tismon discord and a question have any of you
played pokemon sns and what's your take if yes rags hasn't played it and i don't think he gives
a shit about pokemon uh we did address this a little bit earlier i think someone asked about it
so hopefully the question has been answered but yeah not huge pokemon fans here i don't think
um i loved the first well i love pokemon blue yellow and gold they were the ones i played the most
back in the day um hi rag recently got divinity os2 after watching your vid and i'm greatly
enjoying it though the physics and magic armor negating oh wait you know i'll just save this
question but it's a phenomenal game divinity original sin i love it divinity division is
really is much better than the original and the original is great as well it's all good
uh wags measures come in liters confirmed also high wags i mean i don't think he's gonna deny it
uh throwing in shackles during my break love you guys thank you very much thanks the lesbonios get
them it yes the lesbonios the uh you can't have lesbonios uh who was where did that come from i
think it was uh someone i want to say it was like a content creator my brain would be able to recall
this i can actually feel the mechanics in my brain are moving really slowly it's like brain shows
slowly dying searching files and i'm like come on brain what are you doing
uh oh yeah batwoman that was a there was a restaurant owner that doesn't like uh lesbians
or i maybe gave people in general and i was like oh no the lesbonios um what's your favorite tea
mauler i don't have a favorite tea i like a lot of different ones if i'm gonna drink it but i
typically don't even drink tea i'm a failed british man um also high wags there's one episode
also high wags there's one episode of scooby where velma says it's old man's so and so but
it's actually a random guy and they never met and velma got salty saying it didn't count okay
uh is scooby doo is awful fight me don't at me yeah don't at me that's the one i should have said
uh is scrappy doo saying puppy power the dog equivalent of him saying white power oh no
oh dear uh night i mean yeah go ahead but i'll just say he's literally referring to he is you know
kind of uh almost not exactly racial type but it's uh something it should be condemned you are right
yes it's horrible um night i look forward to this being read on efap 64 oh no we got you in the same
one we nailed it bang rags don't insult hitler by comparing him to the unspeakable evil of scrappy doo
also high um i like beginning scrappy but when it's just him no oh so when he was first in it
okay um i am liberty prime i will accept mod status to defend the chat against chinese invaders
and remember death is a preferable alternative to communism oh well um it'll be pending again when
are there more people and impression what again when there are more people and impression i think
that's in relation to the scrappy doo thing is the same account uh rags any chance arch will join efap
he almost did uh last week um because there was a couple of guests dropped out and we we just
cycled through a couple of possibilities we let people open and um uh we will get him on it'll
happen there's a lot of people we're trying to find the right time and place for now epstein
would be the perfect captain cutler on an account that both aren't dead and both would pretend to
be their own ghost fitting wouldn't it sure let's get epsteeded to a lot of uh made stream
storylines potentially if the episode nine leaks are true apparently ray didn't love bad enough
to save him nor did luke or leah or han so much for that theme we'll see uh i'm assuming
they're gonna contradict heavily odd stuff to do with fably it's gonna be amusing to say the least
more in rags what do you think of star wars jedi fallen order apparently wolf hates it but he's
wolf so yeah wolf's gonna make a long form review me and rags are intending to play it he's gonna
do it for review i'm gonna do it because i want uh to get through it and to have footage so
that question will be interesting in future i didn't know wolf didn't like it i've just been
hearing good things from it so he's played it to death he wants to play it more to death he's got
a lot to say about how everything works in that game and i think his conclusion is that we've
we're we're reaching so much bad star wars content that even mediocre star wars content is looking
great um but i don't want to put it i don't want to put words in his mouth like i'm not sure if
he's saying that at all you'll have to check his twitter takes on it but i'm pretty sure he doesn't
like it um interesting yeah we've got just over seven six seven minutes we won't be able to get
all of these but i can get close um i want to be the hulk because of the prawn apparently
oh yeah that was something we covered on efab as well that was i am that robbie i think that's
efab like 28 or something so much lore um knights of ren golden company snoke jaws sequels dark
fake pandas su polio watson vader all my sanity what wins the title of most redundant
redundant uh that would be
i'd probably go with golden company because in the season they were hyped up beyond belief
and they may as well have not even have been there they did absolutely nothing and they were
like a tenth of what they were promised to be in size like you can't get more redundant than
you are deleted by happenstance and nobody even cares she's just like okay um
i do like good arthur but i came for a bonfire that's with a clown face as well all right
all right uh diabeto can vote for every type of diabetes he has oh so he can vote he's got 15
types he can vote 15 times okay i understand um just wanted to say astartis was hacked or is
still hacked yeah we'll uh we'll obviously be keeping an eye out sucks and i hope it gets
sorted out youtube could really afford to lend a hand there um i'd use the n-word pass to read
the sith dagger then use it to destroy all of jj's recording equipment so we don't have to finish
this trilogy oh yeah that's a part of the leaks uh the efap meter better be 12 hours minimum or
else oh we probably would make it really long to be honest with you if we did it uh diabeto is just
baby galactus learning the ropes makes sense to me mauler mauler fingers rags halo 3 flood door
my goodness i don't really know what that means exactly but it sounds horrifying
um i know the flood though they're like the zombies of halo i follow some of it yes
please look up harman smith for future efap please
harman smith i mean i can have a look not sure what i'll find with that
uh i meant to say rank them in order of redundancy the star wars movies
i mean would would could you say any of them are redundant like i
oh wait sorry rank them in order of redundancy the the selection you gave me i can't do that
unless we have a really long answer we might you know i'll save the question see if i can do it with
rags um another point so i can probably answer another three or four maybe more if i go a bit
fast um lava does not contain sugar diabeto has no power over it laga lava kills many creatures
build fire resistance for that one rah and may the dawn bless you yeah it's just advice on how rah
can get rid of the diabeto problem i suppose uh here's your tracker for the start of episode 62
super chat 146 um didn't make it 146 i guess oh i guess 146 but which time zone
oh he's um a porg jenny jar jar scrappy bob stuckman hybrid why would you want that why would you
even suggest that uh wolf's new catchphrase hello all my fellow steamboats has wolf seen him yet
no no i don't think so um and yeah i don't think he was there for that is he there for memes or did
he go no i don't think he saw the steamboat thing no because ben was there so and he missed that
um which would you rather admit tlj is a cinematic masterpiece or argue for the positive merits of
homosexuality to rah on the top of a 35 story building i can go with the second one i had a
fun with that sun god isn't gonna throw me from the roof i'd go the second uh loving vincent equals
2016 van gogh oil painted movie oh yeah i heard about that look really cool um i'm all a high rag
still cashing up at a 52 happy to see wolf come back as we all come back as we all were oh yeah
yeah everyone's really happy to see him back and hopefully in future too all right running close to
the end here i'll do my best uh shadow view plans to be at the abbey next year missed you at the
recent one much sadness i don't know yet unfortunately my health is actually a bit on the
downside these days uh and so we're not sure if i'm gonna be up to traveling uh it's just like
i'd love to try i'd love to get there but we just need to figure it out yeah i imagine it's a lot
of fun seeing you at one of those things oh it was massive but it was it was such a good success as
well so if i'm going it'll certainly be announced though and hi rags hi muesli hello uh hey mola
i don't know how often you watch anime but what got you to watch one punch man a friend of mine
highly recommended it but so check it out i think with most the anime i looked at so if major lee
looks at women what jeb nickels look at she looks at major lee you see that's how that works back to
back nearly out of time uh as a fellow ozzy we leave the toilet door open in case of spiders
snakes box jellyfish and drop bears for easy escape yep you have to just take them account
and uh i will jump a little bit ahead to read this one rah said this is for christmas toys
for the shadlings if they're into that kind of thing and you uh drop fifty dollars so
i will pass that along we'll we can talk about that as soon as the stream ends which is going
to be in a couple of seconds so uh thank you everybody for the kind donations i will read
the rest there's not a huge amount this time uh on the next efap which will be a week from now
hopefully uh we've got memes to cover we will sort them out in the next one and um yeah thank
you everybody for staying as long as you did for for keeping up with us and um thank you for the
guests of which many have left gone to sleep and woken up or gone to their jobs and come back as
naturally they do um it's been a lot of fun and uh yeah we will catch you again thank you shad for
hanging out with me so long as well i really appreciate it dude being an absolute pleasure
and i will see you guys later as well goodbye all and have a good one
