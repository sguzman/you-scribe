your sister's a pussy your sister's a pussy your sister's a pussy well there
we go sometimes I mean if she's acting like a fucking pussy then yeah look what
I think it's a philosophical discussion that should be addressed what is the
penis equivalent of the word pussy is it Willie I think it's cock I think yeah
I'd say cock too he's like dad my cock it's just oh why is this the scenario
like someone has kicked him in now even then I'd say dick he's like man ah
someone kicked me in the dick dick seems less sexual than cock to me
yeah yeah sexual word for it I think yeah I'm thinking so turkey baster I
have no idea what else you'd call it I like how more sexual than cock streamers
was was unlisted I forgot to make it public it's public now so no one will
have heard that we're fine but they'll hear it they'll hear it on the vlog
vision and they'll be like what and people who watch this involved for me
like why isn't Jack commenting on this no they'll know cuz you just said it
idiot no now they'll know they wouldn't have known them no idiot cool
you don't know Star Wars years you fool 97 1980 oh I've been to 1980 oh no wait
no I wasn't alive then damn I've been to the 1990s does that count
that's what I have to say literally nothing live coronavirus pandemic real
time counter world map 95k watching I guess everyone's home there was me
thinking it would take a while for a first corona reference but nope comes
right out what else comes right out um there's so many answers to that I'm
hoping you'll do something funny I just wanted to know what chat would say
what else comes right out oh United States is winning when I saw that
super chat for creamy she he wants me to read out the TFA is almost finished it's
not and I will fight such a super chat the moment why am I keep getting ping
noises only everybody just joined the watch together you guys make me sick
speaking of making me sick we should probably announce guests let's do it in
dynamic this way this time this way you're not gonna wait 40 minutes in well
I mean I don't like really care about them so I'm trying to get it out of the
way you know I mean well in fairness we're all immensely famous I think all
the faces will be recognizable except judge dread they'll be like that I was
actually funny for chat to try guess who that is if they look at the
description they'll know but it's still pretty funny so to be like is that like
fucking the person dude I'll be like no it's captain midnight captain have you
ever spoken to him Jay they ever did they invite you to Stowell's defined Jay
no they didn't well to be fair I'm not sure it's defined I didn't notice if
they did it was um I know I somebody sent me a message saying that they they
happened to be on the in the know for the Stowell's defined thing this is
totally like unsolicited and anonymous so I don't have any reason to believe it
I just thought it was funny apparently like there was somebody suggested the
idea of inviting me to Stowell's defined and just right shot it down he was like
no no no no no we don't we don't we don't all again involved that would
fucking oh and you know the sad thing is I don't know if I would have agreed I
think I might have just out of like oh you guys invited me that's nice to be
fair you know if you'd been in it maybe it would have been successful wait wasn't
it was it not successful some people's videos did well didn't they some people's
but like for most of the people in the playlist the video like the video is
like for most of them it's it's bad for like the channel that it's on like
they're all underperforming videos considering the chat my god there's 67
of them like post a video with that in the title they just add it to the
playlist what's what's the lore behind this so the idea was a bunch of video
essayists got together to make the Marvel but one marvelous scene and a lot
of them did pretty well and basically the idea was you pick one scene from the
MCU and say why it's so good and they're like let's do it with Star Wars and then
it didn't go so well oh did they run out of good scenes in Star Wars now what
is the thing I was kind of thinking like after 67 there must be some people
who've done the same seed and stuff I don't know about half of them are the
fucking binary sunset you got to assume at least five but yeah I I mean we
should all do that sometime we should call it mmm shitty media defined do a
series where we go through one film let's say Suicide Squad and that could
be fun actually I did that once I want to do one scene it'll be fine there you go
that's our next big family project um yeah so I haven't seen Suicide Squad I
don't want to I'm gonna reference it in TFA part 3 and you'll you'll only ever
know it from the stupid memes about slipknot his head exploding even if you
didn't know that or not I don't even it's it's good shit um either way yeah
we got we got Jay say hello Jay weekend warrior say hello Jay hello and Jay
Longbone hello Lord faggot Ron oh my god you can't say that jade does not
deserve that kind of treatment that bully why do you think he wears the mask
he's trying to stay away from that kind of harassment it's to prevent to prevent
insults I ain't afraid of no ghost I don't think who I was until I put on the
mask no they still don't not me my muzzle is always ready for action it's
like you put it on someone's like oh my god who is that and you're like this
one's like it's just as Jay my goodness it's double D and Eddie wow I was until
I put on the mask because people already knew no like oh his face is kind of
obscured now when you're gonna get a new icon who uses the same icon for ages
like seriously I'm getting one now just do you put a mask on it doesn't make it
new Jay no hey now it is actually a mascot cuz he's got a mask
yeah you mask on mascot so um I was gonna I think some of you seen this on
Twitter I just wanted to just want to show the efap willed this this this tweet
that went out so right right at the start of it you can see that they snapped a
screenshot of just right myself and screen crush what a trilogy of creators
if I may say and they said me likes one video about Star Wars YouTube here's an
endless stream of boring two-hour-long reviews written by snorting neckbeards
who nitpick and misunderstand every tiny thing about the movie you like enjoy
oh I want this person to make his video and why the rise of Skywalker is
actually a fucking masterpiece and all of us are just getting it wrong because
our Neanderthal mongoloid brain just cannot handle the thematic resonance of
the ludo narrative I mean like I saw that tweet and it made me smile then I
saw the I was so sick of their kind when is someone gonna put these kind of some
kind of a camp fucking stupid evil Star Wars reviewers
they would that's what they pretty much see in Africa they pretty much see us
that way we need to go like I know you're a fan of Quinton's videos but
he's a really bad influence when it comes to stuff like that you can't be
saying that yeah I kind of feel like he's rubbed off on you in a bad way
mm-hmm she like a slap noise of it hey I never imagined you so quiet oh yeah I
probably should have mentioned returning the king has been slapped down by
copyright unfortunately um fuck I put out a fixed what fixed one and I got
slapped down and before it even went live and then I fixed up another one and
I'm gonna wait a week before well a few more days at least before I let it go
out again but fellowship and two towers have survived so that's nice that's good
it also wouldn't let me pray now return to the king I set a premiere and it just
didn't it was just like now oh okay but it let it go out it's really odd but
even odder metals John Wick video has been stricken down by like a like a
distributor it's not even like the production company and they gave him a
strike like his channel has a strike now and they didn't give a timestamp for
what they were copyright and they were just like nah the video it was like oh
that's useful and the creator chat is like unavailable because of
corona tisms apparently like I don't I don't really understand how YouTube
employees can't work from home you'd think they would be like so that there's
no avenue there there's the whole you could send emails and it's like oh good
I can't wait to send an email that's just that's the way to get it sorted out
and yeah it was his it was his first attempt it was like there's loads of
effort in the attitude and he just he's been ravaged by some random company I
don't even recognize cool but the thing is like they didn't even if they had
monetized it had been like okay but nope it just got rid of it was like oh
bye and you might be like well what could be the motivation there it had
like a thousand views and it's a brand new channel like why and it was a
manual claim so like they fucking hell yeah yeah it's one of those companies
they just hire people I guess to look through YouTube and Google search that
all the time did anyone make a John Wick video today
well this is the interesting thing you can still he has two channels one where
he uploads his twitch vods and he premiered it on twitch so you can find
it on his YouTube vod channel where he streams the video like that's still up
so it really does come across as this wasn't a bot that did it it was like a
some angry dude yeah it was in a bot sorry yeah can the distributor manual
claim it was it wasn't a bot what's I'm saying like you know for the the small
chance that some bot can be considered manual I'd be like it's definitely well
I can't say definite but as far as I can tell is definitely not detected by a
bot but I just don't understand why someone would even have found his video
that quickly when it had that many views that's yes well I think they hire
people to do this maybe a bot like finds the videos and then someone has to check
the notifications if you know what I mean like oh the boss from this is this
bad and then they go yeah it is because he has clips from moving in that's bad
looking through YouTube videos because like YouTube has its own bots and if
someone else has an external bot then YouTube wouldn't be able to differentiate
that from a manual claim I assume but they'd still have to a person would
still have to manually claim it even after the bot finds it no not if they
have a bot to then it would say content ID a manual claim means that it wasn't
automatically run through the copyright system they might use some system to find
they might use some system to find it but a someone like an account some
person has to actually make the claim yeah the only way I can see it making
sense is that they had some kind of general bot that just notifies them
whenever a video related yeah so the cool thing was supposed to be that we
would be like oh he's got his video out now you guys can check it out but mmm
gone and the only way to find it now is on his streaming channel where he
uploads the vods which you know I'll probably put that in the description
actually I think there's a timestamp in his comments but yeah it's called
releasing my first video on stream and it's on his channel yeah he's got 985
subs on that channel as soon as he crosses into a thousand he's gonna try
and get the partner quote unquote thing with YouTube and then maybe consider
releasing it on that channel instead because he's not sure if the fact that
he was unpartnered and like a brand new channel that that's why he got the
strike as opposed to like if I had uploaded his video on my channel I don't
think I would have been given a strike that like never happens especially with
a video with that kind of editing it's very odd I don't know don't know what's
going on but yeah that'll that'll be in the description at some point if I can
do that now I'll sort out but um speaking of you know a good old Mr.
Mel if you if you just pull that up I want to show everyone that's just funny
we'll have to sync through just timing it so it's from one of the streams and
plate creations made a little animation everybody got a zero yeah it's zero mm-hmm
yeah I do three two oh hello hi wow blaming the internet very sexist um we
got have you got that Twitter video up we're gonna we're gonna sink and play
it's only 15 seconds okay okay okay three two one go so we are we playing
something or this is it I could just play do fuck it I was hacked shit all
as well yeah especially after knowing his video is taken away from him for no
reason strike like yeah I know the fire anybody of the five of us had a had a
manual strike before I'm not sure maybe but no nobody's ever won it's just been
always a super inconvenience yeah I'll always fight him but I just it's just a
pain in the ass to deal with that shit cuz yeah I've only ever had one strike
I've had loads of copyright claims like we're going past 500 at this point but
yeah I don't know what it also there's not much advice as well just cuz right
now there's not much help to reach out to everyone's dead no no no no no summer
dads don't you fear mongering yeah
only is the link for weekend warriors channel not right oh my goodness I'm so
sorry that should be corrected now I'm also gonna throw metals stream video in
there what is this a link to what do you mean what channel is this that what it
was before what does it say it says it's called we can warrior but oh did I
just grab a different weekend I'm sorry somebody's stolen your your name oh he's
like a surfer bro tactical gear and other cool stuff it's got a video with
Pepe on the front called the great awakening part one celebs and the corona
to positive ending what for pigs caught in homemade trap this is a strange
channel let's go 62,000 subscribers yeah we're the same like to see we have the
same number of subscribers oh my goodness I saw that number of subscribers I
clicked the light I was like this isn't the right channel wait have you just
changed all your thumbnails and oh my god he doesn't like fun part one what
nightmares are made dude this is the best thumbnail I've ever seen it's the
celebs in the corona virus part two little corona Pepe
positive ending well that's what I read out I don't get it what assume it's an
interactive thing where you click the oh wait a what the fuck are the odds of you
guys having almost exactly the same about our subscribers as well that is
weird yeah that's crazy and also why did you have to trap to get that many
well you know what because Hillary sacrifices chickens to Moloch did you
know that guys I didn't know I didn't believe it did you know that please let
me beat the Donald Trump man dude you need to copy his strategy weekend warrior
he's taking your name and he's using it to just annihilate the competition which
is you reviewing rise of skywalker really posted within the last week oh my
god they have to step it up yeah man speaking of which you're reviewing that
old stalls movie that came out last year right yep man the best yeah me and J
reviewed that back when it was cool where have you been oh I've been studying
it better than ours is that what you're saying yeah that's what he just said well
I'm not saying it outright just just putting it out there I'm implying it
yeah you're gonna have any cameos in this in this video I'll think about it
Wow yeah Jay brings you into his video and what do you do in return nothing no
dude he did something in return but we can't talk about that hey you said you
won't talk about it with other people I didn't talk about it I just said that I
wasn't gonna talk about it idiot oh that's talking about business hours but
yeah I guess if we can warriors down there and if he's Australia to Jason
then so how are you guys we can we can I'm okay I'm alright things are fine
over here jump into our first video of the night if you'd like this one we're
not watching the whole thing we're just watching a part of it that someone linked
me to and I thought it was amusing so where are we okay is everyone in the
watch together watch together German oh that's racist that you don't speak German
to 255 all right so this is a this is a friendly character called make stuff and
I believe he's uh he's been on smud boys stream while they were discussing
artisms and stuff and yeah this this is something happens in this video and I
thought it was amusing I'll show everybody to buy that black of spectacle
the time travel in looper is as blunt and impactful as it's blunderbusses no
it's not what is Star Wars episode 8 why did I brought no minimalist effects to
the maze minimalist explanations you didn't like oh look at this any of them a
thousand times already and this of course is the perfect place to air your
grievances because I a total stranger really truly care about how much you a
total stranger disliked this two-year-old film fascinating the algorithm
um so like only his humor was as good as editing yeah I guess the joke is like
he's trying to explain what's good about it and then some asshole jumps into that
comments section and is like the last Jedi's objective of bad I've used I've
used facts and reason to determine that TLJ is universally unlovable well well
Darth Maul isn't wrong I was gonna say you can trust him these people are
definitely totally not mad he didn't wear my new icon he blin my old one
that's racist probably bloon yes that's a future of a reference I think right
they have bloon bloon ball is it I can't remember I don't know maybe because the
voice sounds the same oh and this is nostalgic nostalgic is the one that did
the video about why Homer Simpson deteriorated that I'm fairly sure you
see just picture you're like cancer or something study look at that poor Homer
Simpson got cancer yes so well I mean you could just be generic video essay
voice man you know this one no the voice is super similar I think
let's have a look in Homer what nerd nostalgic becomes unemployed his search
for a job yeah they sound they sound different enough it's fine carry on all
right so says and if you do love it your emotions are wrong and they need to use
more facts and all reason because movies aren't about emotions they're about
continuity and characters earning their power by having specific parents right
more things we've never said ever we're like actually on the opposite team for
that one it's just ray is the we wanted something to explain ray that's all I
think that's what everybody wanted no the last Jedi and ruin Johnson but like
Johnson as a euphemism for male genitalia I mean destroyed Star Wars
because Luke is sad now and the last time we saw him decades earlier he was
happy and they are and that is factually two different emotions which
that was very much never has a Star Wars film been inconsistent with its
continuity what no we've we pointed those out to okay sure it makes no sense
to hide Luke on Anakin's home planet and keep his Skywalker last name yeah I
agree I think that if you're gonna hide Luke you should probably lose the
Skywalker name they didn't do that though I'm sure Leia says she remembers
their mother even though she died seconds after they were born I thought
that Leia saying she remembers her mother was fine because like you could
you could feel that you do it like when you were super young like I kind of
remembered something you know but uh but all right yeah maybe and that is more
of a prequel problem than a sequel one yeah you're right I'm sure they had
literally no reason not to shoot down the escape pod at the beginning of a new
hope because they know droids exist well they just they I think they even
specifically say that they think it's a malfunction it's like who cares and then
they're like oh shit so I mean it's not really I like definitively say they
should shoot all things that are moving in space that haven't been approved of
I still think that's pretty weak sauce I think that it's thin I would give you
that but I don't understand why this is being treated as though I we don't have
these criticisms like we we did that thing we did that thing on one of the
faps do you remember this rags us going way back but um we read out a comment
that said like the second they criticize the OT the community will fall apart
because they're united by hating on TLJ and we were like all right let's do it
we did a challenge of trying to five find five criticisms per OT film and I
think yeah and I think we I mean I think I remember the conversation I don't
remember the specifics of it though the one I remember for Empire is the the
speeders the ships attacking the 8080s head-on which is like why would you do
that especially when the 8080s can't attack you when you come from behind
them mm-hmm just like that seems like the way to do it and then return of the
Jedi it's just like the whole opening 40 minutes or so is very weird you just
understand what everyone's really doing yeah we you know but even if right even
if the OT was the worst thing ever wouldn't change how good or bad TLJ's
continuity is now would it unless the characters were inconsistent and that
and therefore they can't be not fucking okay I'm sure the Death Star could have
just traveled to the same side of the planet as Yavin for to immediately fire
on it and wait but didn't they didn't know that until they'd arrived right
the Death Star arrived at Yavin and then the moon was on the other side of it so
they were like oh fuck is he saying that they could have hyperspaced they
didn't know they were gonna be against the clock either right I was like I'll
better hurry up the planet might leave I don't know what do you what I mean I
remember someone saying they could have shot through the planet surely I suppose
that would be an option right cuz you'd fuck up a moon if you blow up a planet
for sure that the moon is around of it what's the gas turn right so either you
can shoot through it or you can shoot it and you can fuck it up either way right
yeah yeah but even then I don't know if they would destroy a whole planet over
that and we're also dealing with talking who thought it was ridiculous the idea
that the Death Star was even in trouble he was like now we're just gonna crush
him he'll be fine yeah I'm sure the ewoks just happen to have a dress in
layers size what I don't know what to do with that I'm like some big fucking
ewok lady out there and the burrow had to borrow clothes from I'm sorry the
fucking the creatures that eat people in a galaxy where basically everyone is
that size I believe that they'd have I believe it you don't get to choose where
you come out of hyperspace there are hyper there are lanes I mean as much yeah
I've been told that but like the yeah it's never in the movies and the movies
just kind of make it look as if it's down to coordinates but then you could
be like the coordinates are part of the lanes like they kind of need to maybe
work on that that's probably something I would have done if revamping the OT to
try and limit it all but besides you can't like light speed forward by you
know a mile or something because it goes way too fast unless you could somehow
input that like go zero point zero zero zero X units forward who knows how
hyperspace works all I know is you can blow up an entire enemy fleet with it
which is yeah pretty yeah it's only one in a million Eddie right to dealing with
that it's just gonna be like how do we what do we do it's one in a million but
it could also save the day entirely I guess you just got lucky I don't know
what the percentage is for one out of a million I stand by the idea that she was
trying to run away there's like this cut to the unseen thing where she's like
it's too late for them at least I can save this ship everyone's off of it and
shows a slamming into it it's like this slow-motion highly horrific like his
skin and boat are being torn apart she's screaming really loud it's like oh my
god like so quick and yet I feel every moment yeah for some reason it's like in
slow motion what you cast a freezing spell on this all first you'll Star Wars
space god is punishing her being such a fucking bitch you should have told Poe
the plan and sure Emperor Palpatine gave the rebels the actual plans to death
star instead of fake ones which would make infinitely more sense um he he let
them know that there was a shield generator right that's what the Emperor
didn't return in the Jedi but the point was to bait them as far as I'm aware
because the plans they got with R2-D2 in the first film that's not something the
Emperor wanted them to have by the way you do this prison does understand like
the Last Jedi and Riser Skywalker and TFA they have like thousands of these
issues while the OT is like oh I can put them on one hand about that yeah it's
like it's almost like I mean they it's not like they don't know it's a straw
man it's like someone putting you know it's like if someone replies to them
going oh I could like the Last Jedi because only the feelings matter and if
I feel that the film had all of the Ewoks in it then that's true because
feelings are all that matter like it's the same kind of thing it's like they
don't think that you think that they're just being an ass Palpatine gave them
yeah fake plans and have a fucking discussion about how terrible the Last
Jedi is and how the Riser Skywalker is like fuck no I have to go check that dialogue
again but uh I guess the the complaint is that Palpatine gave them any useful
information at all but I thought the whole point was he was trying to draw
them all in to a big kill box it was like why would he risk giving fake
information that they might know is fake because for reference they used the
Death Star to blow things up in that fight
wait is this a video about the Riser Skywalker being good yeah I wasn't
covering this yeah I just thought this part was funny it's like he's like do it
a preemptive like if you want to say it's objectively bad to go away
I wonder how many people have copied pasted this into this into the oh what does he do?
Obi-Wan says Anakin can't win because he has the high ground even though
Darth Maul had the high ground over Obi-Wan
two-year-old film and we went to hide against the failure students and then
refused to trade Luke literally identical to what Luke did that's that's
fascinating Yoda was like trying to hide so he wouldn't get killed I think it's a
little different than Luke being like yeah and just runs off also that's a
pretty big failure from Yoda his entire student like all of his students even
the children and his entire culture all just wiped out that he couldn't stop it
that's that's quite a daunting thing to have to deal with as well as the fact
you'll be hunted down Luke on the other hand his student had a bad dream
yeah he had a bad dream I would be I'd be terrified to be a student there yeah my subconscious thought
crime will get me killed while I'm sleeping Oh God Luke's uncle Luke is
drunk oh no look he's shushing me fascinating the algorithm thanks you for
your comment I didn't comment I'm sorry also can can we also appreciate that
you guys hear me can you appreciate the fact that he typed that out and like he
went through all the effort to get the picture of mauler and then censor it and
then type all that out and then edit it in a nice way it's just that extra
effort editing is the bread and butter of these videos like yeah that's why
people watch them if they didn't have that they wouldn't have anything I mean
I don't know what the commentary is like in this video yeah I don't know maybe
we'll cover it one day oh but he only has what two thousand oh no two thousand
views on me what on that video yeah two thousand eight hundred and it's such a
nice video I mean it's it's snazzy production values but yeah but there's
like so there's like a million videos like this I was gonna say it's that
style especially with those like the click the click the click sounds and the
whooshing dude this video is so nicely edited that the am doesn't have all of
the lines oh yeah I could actually I can put that on the screen style it's
just I love how it's a picture of rain it just says human she's human please
remember she's super human like don't fucking lie to me she's not human is it
it's an alien try to prove it they wrote an ad backwards it says a human yeah look
at the expression on your face to like classic human what do you mean it's a
picture of right but it's the word but it's not quite the word but it's sort of
a word it's very artsy because it's wrong yeah you know removing bits of
I'm writing it down for a for a 20 2021 Godel and I know that by the time I get
to editing it's gonna say an image with Ray with the weird human it'll make no
sense to me there's stuff like that in the in the Godel that's coming out in a
couple days there's stuff that it just happens and like even because that's
bullshit did the majority of the well he did the editing there was there was
stuff that I was like in the notes where it was like you need to do you remember
tonal like randomly cuts to fire in one of his videos that we covered what ages
ago that's one of the things the desk bullshit had to do I was just like you
have to cut to fire at some point just do that okay and this stuff like to
anyone who hasn't doesn't know all the references fuck what the fuck why what
is this also what are we doing jumping around his video
this guy fucked up Star Wars more like more ruin penis my future Star Wars
Louise got came people are still people are still desperately waiting for like
that trilogy to be confirmed I'm just like oh god it's not gonna happen guys
do it do we do we know that it won't happen I thought they would done with
trilogies now we assume that it won't because of how catastrophic the last
Jedi was for just like the Star Wars brand but this is Disney so who the fuck
knows striking oh look it's striking a stricken that's awesome I give that a
thumb up oh striking struck through oh look at that it time travels through
space don't get hey man I think I genuinely think if he came up with
another one it wouldn't be as bad as TLJ because he has less to ruin
like tell me why so it says probably friendly Q right I think everyone would
I think we'd all we'd all get to that point we'd be like you know what fuck it
let's all go not even fuck it like you would be excited to go see that it
depending on the trailer man if you could get me hyped I probably would be
there are no trailers it would okay it's still go see it but you'll be a
really interesting to put that about a buddy behind him and all those different
resources like he has as a you know a cinematographer and just all the people
of basically trade him out for JJ but the same production I would love to see
what happens someone should ask him what he would do like and then make it
themselves so anyway we got a video that's called the rise of Skywalker made
me appreciate the last Jedi even more oh my goodness is that referring to the
older film culture has a lot of presumptions when it comes to how
teleportation should look and we're not covering this kind of day it's not fair
you're playing your being a mean you're bullying right now we're supposed to
play them from start to finish that's the that's the e-fap way Jason it is the
e-fap so um all right so so it's from a wonderful pal I've never been a hello
Greedo hello Greedo hello hello wow rags you didn't say hello to him even though
he said hello to you in his name oh fuck this guy oh this dude screams with the
webcam while he wears his mask what kind of fucking idiot does he take me
for why why would you do that turn on my face cam while I wear my stormtrooper
mask is body language yeah he is is a body language connoisseur he has the
pants where he has to kill a tour of supreme it's consoir rags that's how it's
pronounced cornswoggle cornbred I was gonna do this gimmick for my channel a
long time ago and I'm so glad I didn't what business don't remember no it was
a Kylo Ren mask I was gonna do like a female Kylo Ren like a little rendition
of it is this like Jay Longbone law where you're like a huge fan of Kylo Ren
no all right let's take a look see details oriented wait let's let's let's
bring back to zero sorry I've never been a details oriented Star Wars viewer by
that I mean I've never been one to really get that excited about yes you
are fuck off yes you are look at your face look at your fucking face right now
detail that's a basque
he records the audio prior and then he films himself doing hand gestures to the
audio maybe he could have a microphone he got on the microphone underneath his
like lapel maybe he records it with a mask on
and that's how he gets the gestures to line up and then he records it again in
post-production okay like he plays the video and he listens to himself and
then records a better version okay that's psychotic
logic does it yeah logic does it you shit on logic he's a he's been a past
guess fight fight fight fight fight fight fight fight I just think a large
it logic is probably in the chat right now crying he's not even gonna say
anything it's just like wow I don't know actually how he does it yeah I don't
know if he does I don't know if he does the audio first or if he does I guess he
does the audio first I think he doesn't he plays the audio and then he tries to
react to it and then does like a few takes of as in like doing the he can he
can be a little bit late as long as he's consistently a little bit late then he
could just scoop the timeline over a moment and it'll act like it sinks up
perfectly but yeah doesn't hell agree to literally run a channel that just goes
into all kinds of details about Star Wars I've never seen him do one of those
to be fair what do you mean his videos are all like never about the very
specific stuff as far as I'm aware I guess what qualifies I was checking his
channel for those videos and I saw a video with legit a title that I was
planning to make damn I know Lego style was the complete saga livestream all
right well of course it's gonna be seven parts it's a long game Jay Jesus
back in town but like so this is the part that confuses me right he's got
because I knew I don't remember this he's he's the guy who did the videos
that were like explaining all of the changes for the remasters a lot of those
are details are they not like I don't feel like the spirit is the same thing
like going through what's been changed about a movie and just like you know
like you don't like it concerns him right I guess but like a lot of them are
just effects and stuff this is what I mean it's like some stuff a new kind of
shit oh wait so you're you're defining like details like specifics about what
did he say I only go as far as I don't care about details like a new kind of
lightsaber or a new kind of ship oh so I don't believe him I don't really believe
that I feel like I mean look it's unlikely I'm okay to believe it I feel
he cares about as much as most people do like I feel like we don't care about it
like say for example they're like oh we got a teal lightsaber now I'd be like
okay all right I feel like a guy who's he's who calls himself hello Greedo and
wears a stormtrooper helmet and all of his videos and makes TIE fighters and
Minecraft probably does care about Star Wars like that yeah but racial profiling
racks no it's fucked up but let's let's hear it all right I mean I've never been
one to really get that excited about a new lightsaber or ship design or even
new armor design connections don't make me jump for joy learning about where
people came from or who made what that kind of stuff it's icing on the cake and
a lot I mean I feel like you have an attachment that is above the norm surely
like if you care about the like Luke's dad they remember that was an important
thing right Darth Vader is that his name little detail is that his name is Keith
Keith later but I guess that one's not is it is he referring to like details
like those but that are not important to this story yeah cuz you get whole
channels castle looking like the different kinds of well cuz true but I
feel like he's probably trying to gun for the whole who's raised and dad's
granddad's whatever I guess we just hear him out but that one would be as
relevant as Vader's to Luke's right in terms of what the narrative is going for
I mean absolutely I mean if anything it's more important because Ray is the
best ever and she's way more important than that idiot loser Luke guy until it
was revealed you saying it's different cuz raise was important before it was
revealed like Ray Ray's yeah essentially was so wouldn't his be
classified as even lesser details thing no I think hers are more details we need
to define details especially now now that we have all this information to go
off of then yeah her lineage and how it turned out to be like details is
everything is that to a degree like how did they find the right room to get to
the McMuffin in right Skywalker second just details is it though just cuz it
happens quickly doesn't mean it's not important just because they decide that
it's if they try to play it off as if it's not important that doesn't mean it
isn't so all right let's go forward came from or who made what that kind of
stuff it's icing on the cake and a lot of people love it and yeah some of its
fun sure but I am way more interested in story then the minutia that you'd find
on a Wikipedia are a lot of the minutia makes the story yeah all right Jay
translate well as in like the kind of thing you would have to go to Wikipedia
for and isn't just something that you pick up by watching the movie is like
you know it's like neat little details that people have filled in afterwards
aren't the same as elements that are important to the story if if we're gonna
go with that like things that really don't matter that much but they're like
oh did you know who made Mace Windu's lightsaber it was undak who Dobby from
planet Zold you'd be like oh cool I guess that's relevant cuz he used to
that Dex's diner stick but you but you get that like the difference between
something like that and finding out and finding out raise raise lineage those
two things would be compared to the rest of his body it looks more all right like
let's say he's going with that and let's see how the rest of this works
recall oh my god that's gonna get so misconstrued it's why I wasn't upset about
the Holdo maneuver like some how is that details that is not a detail that
destroys the like the enemy's fleet and that slices the supremacy that's the
chain of J advocate for this I need you know the mechanics of how like the plot
works I mean I guess at this point the only way to make this consistent is if
he's saying things that you have to think about to realize that that could
just be anything yeah things that you think about things that you have things
like things like have to process again it's pretty funny that like you assumed
he was talking about stuff you couldn't possibly gather from the movies and
tiny details that don't matter and he immediately goes to the fucking
hyperspace kamikaze okay this saves everyone's lives like tiny teeth and he
opens with saying this is gonna be misconstrued it's like please clarify
please clarify I'm on a Wikipedia article oh my god that's gonna get so
misconstrued it's why I wasn't upset about the Holdo maneuver like some
people were it breaks the laws of the Star Wars universe yes but how did it
make you feel a lot of old stuff and now they have to account for this in the
future they literally do with a shitty throwaway line and going I also make you
feel like I feel like this is a ruined a lot of stuff why do you think it makes
me feel the way it does hello why do you think that I feel this way does he
think that we just randomly pull feelings out of a I don't know just like
out of a hat so like why does this make me feel it's precisely the simple
process would be like it pisses me off but why does it make you feel that way
because it fucks up everything that came before it how does mechanically doesn't
make sense no no no I'm asking you how it makes you feel
before I thought about it I was like whoa that was cool oh yeah I think it was
instant for me I was like what the fuck has just happened I I remember the when
that when the music out at first I was like oh but then you'd concerned face I
had concerned face for many hours after seeing the movie I was like hmm and then
when you think about it and you discuss it that the little fire starts to get
porter and bigger and oof oof of all the examples to use I know right this
may be actually the worst example you could have possibly used and you fucking
homing beacon down to this what if what if someone said whether or not Anakin
killed the Emperor is just details would that be worse
no be like how he killed the emperor so it's like throwing the Emperor down the
shaft is just details no because he's his example is the holdo maneuver yeah
but he the thing that he's saying is just details is the mechanics of it not
the actual event itself but couldn't we argue the mechanics of Anakin killing
the Emperor is altered because of him being a clone or spirit or been
having bodies we need to understand all of those mechanics now yeah but yeah I
yes details about like just pure event rather than mechanics but that's what
the event is how do you I'm trying to like that's kind of where I'm going with
it like how do you have an event without the mechanics I'm kind of like
are you oh I think I might know what you mean are you trying to say that as
impure emotional resonance rather than the mechanics do you mean I maula shot
rags and then you find out the specific mechanics where I shot a cannon at him
you'd be like wow that interesting details but the point is that I shot him
yeah something like that I guess does it bother anybody else that his little
mouth thingy is not symmetrical oh yeah it is kind of huh now you can't unsee
it you're welcome thanks thanks dick thanks Johnson what gets me what pulls
me into a Star Wars movie is the same thing that pulls me into any other movie
a good story surprises and characters you feel compelled to root for or so you
hated the sequels right so a good story for him is characters to root for
characters to hiss at and every character pretty much every movie has
characters to root for well I feel like if he goes this broad there's no movie
that he shouldn't enjoy yeah I mean there's always gonna be like I I'm
trying to think of a movie where there's a character that you're not rooting for
like maybe flesh and blood fuck that's an old ass reference but hmm I would
take a movie like The Last Jedi over a movie like The Rise of Skywalker but
there's people to hiss at in Rise of Skywalker who'd you root for when you
watch the prestige huge well I want to be careful about spoilers but Hugh
Jackman until the end yeah when you realize that his obsession has basically
taken over him well I I'll actually element that I like early on Hugh Jack
maybe halfway through you sort of drop off and then you start just watching it
unfold because you have reasons to dislike both of them yeah once once he
does his first thing or I guess once he I'm trying to see a non-spoily way of
Michael Kane yeah Michael Kane I was reading is it I think I see you trying
to say that prestige would be an example of a film you're not necessarily rooting
for a hero sort of thing yeah I would agree with that by a certain point yes
I'm like yeah I don't I don't know who like what I want to happen but I'm
invested hmm yeah I still think a character to root for is still too broad
though absolutely yeah if you're not rooting because if you're not rooting
for anyone in the prestige here's thing I think that if you're rooting for one of
the people that's it's kind of fucked up in a way because they're both terrible
you'll be yeah it would be interesting to sort of clarify exactly what the
person means I don't think the Christian Bale's character is terrible well let's
see yeah yeah I think he's pretty terrible he he takes his desire for his
career to insane lengths but in thinness what do we reference should we
just be split it has been out for like 14 years so no I think people just see it
though the scene where Hugh Jackman drops under the stage and yes but you
have to remember that he's had his something has been stolen at that point
that's incredibly significant so I guess it comes down to whether or not you
think that that's a justified action and I would understand that point like
okay so with the scene with the bullet catch at that point I'd be like okay like
yeah that kind of fucked me up but at this point I'm kind of willing to let
him have it like you know like I mean that's you I don't know I ain't letting
them have that like at the point where you understand like if you're not
letting him have it then I think the reason the only thing to do is go to the
police like don't do what he did what are they gonna do he was he was in
camouflage court he could just deny he was even there I guess doesn't make it
morally acceptable because the police can't take care of it well I'm not
making that argument yeah that's what I'm saying like it like they're both
they're both not good persons I'm not really rooting for I mean like one of us
I think that his character is certainly more sympathetic but yeah yeah I
absolutely I mean so what tips the scale I really don't spoil what tips the
scale is the the framing and what happens with the little girl that shit is
just like okay you're a yeah you're a fucking Satan person but the worst thing
Christian Bale's character does I still think there's a level of understanding
and I'm assuming we're right in the under the stage thing is that the worst
thing he does would you say it's pretty mean treatment of that other character
who and who sort of incidental to the main ball not incidental but you know
like isn't really part of the main plot you know she he's pretty terrible around
her so welcome to the prestige effect I would say that I think of the two I
would say that Hugh Jackman's morally worse I think that's something of an
absolute from my perspective yeah pretty even Christian Bale's character says
he's he's essentially gone too far they like crossed an invisible line of sorts
once he involves the the girl who do you root for in a clockwork orange
society yeah the orange I mean you said you can I think we all agree you don't
have to have a hero to root for yeah and that's things on this and he showed him
these films is like did you root for any of these characters is like no at the
same time if you don't root for him but you're sympathetic to them at the same
time I'd like to say like I root for Ray and Riza Skywalker and against Palpatine
why didn't you enjoy it hello greeno well yeah I'm curious if you'd be like no I
don't know subjective which to him it is he's subscribing he's subscribing
subscribe to me please he's describing entirely subjective criteria I would
love to know can't be called a good movie based on these standards the
prestige we just went through that kind of yeah I mean but no you could I was
about to say but can't anyone just root for anybody at that point like I was
rooting for General Grievous in episode three I'm sorry I like a movie if it's
cool it's got good things in it I want a movie that has dinosaurs in it there I
said it Jurassic World see that oh man we got that next year right Jurassic
World's gonna be delayed next they probably hadn't even I don't even know
if they start filming it yet everyone's saying that I'm 2021 is gonna be the
baron year because 2020 stars movies that can pop out that have finished
they're all just in post but they're not gonna be released well they'll be on
streaming services and stuff right surely I guess maybe but there's no
there's not gonna be any cinematic releases for a while true but that's
what I'm saying is the 2021 will apparently be like the year without as
many blockbusters significantly because they've all got fucked up the Jurassic
Park because you root for the Jurassic or for the park the park I like the park
I'd go there I don't know I feel like if you root for the Jurassic you know it's
very they're very sympathetic the Jurassic I can't believe you root for
the fascists yes what's up poll was a mistake oh that's that's the you talk
about the Star Wars what are you yeah that was some good fucking rat right
there all the planets anyway hello greeter hello take a movie like the last
Jedi over a movie like the rise of Skywalker tells why every single time
and it's worth contrast on these criteria on these criteria they're the
fucking identical yeah I was gonna say it's pretty hard I'd say that the
characters are more clear cut into those categories in the rise of skill J
absolutely yeah sort of on the fence about Ben I guess you I guess I was
gonna call him sheep Snoke is there to be his he's sort he's hicible yeah but
no more or less hicible than Palpatine in the next one is a raise that's a root
for and then Ben is on the line I guess he's not either he goes from hicible to
kissable Obama Snoke yeah I guess his first name is Evander is it no EV a n d
o r Evander unless it's pronounced as no Evan door Evan door that sounds like
some some of that fantasy shit Evander sounds like what a D&D character why is
it like Evander yeah because it sounds like lavender no it's chat help me out
what's what's what's my brain doing connecting if I add an L and switch to
letters it's literally lavender yeah no no it's not I'm thinking of is there a
Harry Potter character begins with e that could be similar ish to event I feel
like it does that yeah there is I swear there all Evander that's it yes that's
not what I said but still Harry Potter ear rape I just thought I typed Harry
Potter e into Google and I got Harry Potter escape room Harry Potter elf and
things like Harry Potter ear ear rape that makes sense Google isn't supposed
to recommend words like rape what the why not what are you trying to say well
if I type in RAP I get rap I know rape I rap name generator is the first thing
that comes up so you would you like to know more oh there's a thing you fill
out you fill out a little form and it gives you your your rap name what's your
favorite TV character wait you're you asking for our picks so you'll see that
this will be the efap rap name how are we gonna how we all gonna agree on our

general I'm not going for what about actual ones all right Jay that's your
real first name right yeah why are we going with Jay why can't we have a bit
of a match up and you should use all of the first letters of our names Jim row

what's my name Kate Kane all right I by the way I can't wait for watching that
woman I'm I'm going to with the drawls oh yeah so that's something I'm supposed
to announce to people we are switching editors for batwoman unfortunately the
current one he's got too many things to do he thought he was gonna be able to
take it off but batwoman takes a long time this is totally okay it simply
means that I'm looking for a new one in talks with a new one and we just kind of
a delay on the batwoman editing tisms I'm afraid that's this wall but you know
that the next one is soon he said he's almost done with the next one and he's
passing me on to an editor he knows so episode is episode 12 is the next one
that we're releasing I can't remember anymore they'll blend together and the
one awesome movie you know so rap name something really pleasant need to

wonderful Walter Walter we got cane train white white blue yeah we got gay
doc that obviously makes sense cream cake cream cake yeah oh my goodness we
got wapper white I can't believe you guys have interrupted so much gay man oh well
back to the interesting video to me the Last Jedi is a very emotion and story
focus film okay translate please
Wikipedia thing that you have to get you know yeah but this guy thinks the
hyperspace jump is detailed yeah Jay what are you what do you think he's
saying tell me I don't remember he defined TLJ versus truss as story and
emotion versus details yeah would process details I guess no I don't know
on Jay I think TROS is more concerned with filling in the law is it is it
really well I know so like that would be a detail nothing makes any sense in TROS
recently PSA stitch made his rise of Skywalker videos and in that he said
that the rise of Skywalker was a whole bunch of exposition where nothing's
explained yeah I agree but like it still has its wannabe emotional payoffs
right it's still like look at these grand moments yeah they can't sit in
trailer so it's so emotional my favorite but I felt so sad for she when
he was burning off do you remember when do you remember when porkins died and
and Poe was like no who cans porkins the dude in the x-wing who were like
borkins yeah don't forget when Ray fucking zap he's a fat guy so getting in
and out of that x-wing is a Chorkins I like when she blew up chewy it cut to
Kylo after she blew up chewy and he was like what yeah he has to shop for his
clothes at the storkins you're upset weekend warrior look I don't know to say
other than he doesn't have a lot of money any porkins listen why did he die
because he went to work and Ryan Johnson sent out nearly two years ago kind of
sums up my thoughts very well
but TLJ distills what the spirit and heart of Star Wars has been in my life
but yes it is personal wouldn't that like why would that be counted to the
first sentence you know I mean but yes it's been all a certain point of view
has to be originals were personal for George Lucas it's why the that's why
they're alive Star Wars films will truly betray the heart and spirit of the
originals if they lose that and become soulless clean homages oh damn that is
probably taking a shot at JJ to be honest but being alive well I mean about
TFA not a but being alive means being messy and it means every film won't
line up exactly with what every fan is expecting or what I love it when they do
that like I just wasn't you weren't expecting it I guess all you were
expecting it which means it doesn't matter what we do because you didn't
expect it but alive being messy they're living there that's how it works so
here's for all the people in chat watching this whenever you get called
into your boss's office because you fucked up whenever your wife gets angry
with you whenever whatever anything bad happens just say hey being alive means
being messy and then you can follow up with I'm sorry you didn't get what you
expected sorry like yeah whenever you're in prison already out your trial
for some terrible crime just look to the judge and say listen your honor being
alive and being messy like the way I killed them and heart of Star Wars has
been in my life WY stand for my toes feel big when yes I don't know maybe
Tuesday for a bonus what yo Jay are you gonna make a suggestion or what my
tussies feel big when you when yellow the rest is implied yeah the rest is
implied it is personal it's a certain point of view and it has to be originals
were personal for George Lucas that's why they're alive they were Star Wars
films will truly betray the heart and spirit of the originals if they lose
that well this is like saying well as long as you make Star Wars that's
personal to you then you did it I just like they do that as he plunges that
knife further into the back of the OT he's like Star Wars films they're gonna
be portrayed if people don't do what I'm doing he's just equivocating all of
people's personal Star Wars nest to George Lucas's originally it's all the
same it's all this is what you got to do and if your vision of it is fucking
garbage Brian's then oh okay okay how is this how is this on Hello Greedo's
channel not a Wikipedia detail if ever I've seen one oh it says Luke Skywalker's
lightsaber was originally blue no that's important I guess he didn't care
about that I guess he made the video didn't care yeah he watches Star Wars
for the for the emotion okay no blue has an emotional resonance to it it
represents calm anger and peace yeah this isn't about the color it's about
what the color makes him feel it jay
toilet commercial how is this not details I like how he's gone to the
where I'm like maybe you're looking too closely at it maybe maybe chill out the
video title is just the force awakens title crawl use the wrong font in that
e the bottom little prong on the easy I don't watch the Star Wars for the
details between those two hours when he wears that mask all the time because it's
it's bright yellow he could barely see it through his visor yeah he puts his
hands up on the screen is it scroll that's what's great about scrolling text
for blind people you can just you can keep your hands still but you can still
read all of it is it scrolls I mean you do get by the way that when the title
court rolls in the emotion there is quite enormous and so whether or not the
font is a particular font I would say that is quite important objectively bad
font oh how the font I feel then I'm a Helvetica man what is my default in my
lungs soulless lean homages star wars films Oh Calibri Calibri body is guys
what's your favorite font I probably times New Roman that that classic shit
yeah I don't care for Times New Roman I don't think it's fine but Calibri and
Helvetica man I'm a wingdings of course honorable mention but I don't know about
that let's see how much comic sans love what's going on I like it's not a main
font my senses it's a side font top-tier font is what you're saying yeah yeah
like it bugged me and then I watched a video about why it shit and I'm like
yeah that's why I just didn't know why my brain knew something wasn't right
wasn't it that it was originally designed for much lower resolutions than
it's for retard played in Wow and low resolution it looks fine yeah it's the
way that you end like when the letters get into alias they don't yeah match in
a good way and stuff someone saying papyrus a quality answer isn't papyrus
the one that gave birth to big idiots that's so funny of the originals if they
lose that and become soulless clean homages close quote Star Wars films you
don't have to say close why did he say close quote what it was at the end of the
quote also you're just reading a tweet from a screen we're gonna assume that
you're quoting his tweet it's did he say open quote at the beginning you can't
close a quote without having opened it first that's breaking all of the rules
now I'm confused how far back does this go
have you been quoting him your entire life?
it's one of his older videos
oh my god
in his first video he ends up
open quotes
hello my name is hello
for years I will be quoting myself
in present time
god it's amazing
will truly betray the heart and spirit of the originals if they lose them
what does it mean to truly betray Star Wars though like surely they wouldn't even say that's a thing
ryan johnson managed it
no he's ryan johnson's
warning people of how not to uh how to avoid it you know he's like oh god look out
well he's just saying like and to to a degree I agree with what he's saying is like
don't just remake the original have a vision of where you want it to go which like yeah that's
gonna be I would rather see a film like if you know like two hypothetical Star Wars sequels and
you've got one is like it's just a clean uh corporate homage and it doesn't take risks and
the other one is the sort of the this is someone's very true vision of where they wanted it to go
I take the vision every time but that's based on hypotheticals and not the last Jedi
I don't I don't I don't think that I don't know I kind of want a safe one
yeah are we talking about like what about the difference between an extremely well-made remake
versus a really crappy new idea
yeah I mean like I don't want to risk it the Star Wars
quality is if like if you assume that just they are um like you know they've got the same right
of just like amount of just basic technical competence would you rather have the risky one
or the the safe one well if you had asked me this in early 2016 then maybe I would have said the
risky one but old haggard experienced now wise sagacious and traumatized rags now definitely
wants to go and hit my younger self in the head and say take the safe one I've seen things I've
seen terrible terrible things like the kind of film where you watch it and you you see it and
you think man someone's like wanted to tell this story for years like you get you get that
what was that I want to see that film and I want to see that Star Wars sequel this kind of Star
Wars sequel that you watch and you have it feels like oh what they've clearly wanted to tell the
story for so long and now they finally get to I will I I don't oh that's what we got with the
Last Jedi we got with loads of things in yeah especially 2019 it's like hey how about a deep
determinative film would we murder John Carter in the opening you're like
that feels like such a corporate mess you know does it yeah yeah I don't know I'm murdering John
Connor in the opening is like a design like committee yeah I feel like that's something
a boardroom would be like maybe don't maybe that's bad that seems too brainer to get that like why
that's a risk they can't figure out why executing John Carter is a bad idea when you
direct sequel to T2 I don't know I think that I I want is that not where a director pitches the
idea and they're like I guess because yeah because just for reference that was I don't think that
was a patient idea it's like um okay we want a film that's focused on Sarah Connor um okay how
we do that well we need to get rid of John well yeah that was the director the director that's
not how you do it the director came out and said that uh he chose to do that because the
two minute films were never about John Connor they were always about Sarah Carter which is the
most brain-dead fucking take you could ever have it's like hey remember those films that are all
about John Carter evolving right it's merely about Sarah think about it it's like how about
both of them how about that how about two characters they're both incredibly important
one of them saves the world one of them allows one of them to save the world breaking news film
has more than one character I listen Star Wars it was all really about Shmi
I always think of Smee what is that with fucking what the pirate yeah
the style saga was all about Smee
I never never land oh my goodness be fucking taking it back
mm-hmm the 1904 clean homages perfectly said I do not want soulless clean homages
I do not want more of the same hey man if they make sense I'm okay with it yeah if more of the
same means more good things I'll fucking take it don't you want more dark fates more Toy Story
jaded in cynical now about cinema
he said something really weird he was like I oh I clean
was it was it in the past five seconds I'll roll it back yeah he said the soul bliss clean
homages perfectly said I do not want soul
if this is 12-hour stream this will be the one section that people focus on
like oh they said they they were making fun of how he said
ie that's that's the that's the content of efap entirely that's that's all focused on ah
nani nani clean homages I do not want more of the same what makes a Star Wars movie great
that's that's an impossible question to answer I can answer well what do you mean he already
answered that he already told us what makes Star Wars he makes it great for him okay you racist
Jesus but to him that's all you need you need to have a hero to root for and a villain to his side
love is all you need rags love is all you need and don't change the lightsaber colors or the
font and you'll be fine okay why is one of his breast pockets buttoned and the other isn't
because he uses the one that's not buttoned it's for what no one ever puts who puts any who if
anyone in chat wears because he I do too I never put anything in my breast pockets because they
they're they're just I think they're just for show
also it's I guess you could put like a pen in there but what my pocket watch like this is 1914
right so this video is all about you you're focusing on the small details
can't I can't stop staring at your breasts they're not actually here
see you're trying to figure out why the button is or is not attached when you should be thinking
about the emotional payoff so I'm saying cigarettes I don't know I feel like that'd be
weird just cigarettes it would make a boxy thing on your yeah do it the 80s way where
you put it in your shoulder called it a titty holster the pockets are off center though
that's what a pocket detector someone saying phone you can fit your phone I don't know maybe yeah
maybe if those pockets you can fit a phone in there it would be really hard for someone to pick
pocket your breast pocket by the way oh man I'm sorry I was just feeling your no oh no I fell oh
there's a great there's a great bit in the it credit about putting your phone in your breast pocket
hang on
that's what that's the joke they go with it falls in the toilet it's it's really fun
in by in your shoulder I bet that you you like wrap it around your shoulder arm the
shit part that's a totally a thing I I know it's a thing I will fight anyone like snakes
yes yeah Jay knows what's up someone said like carry my mobile in my wallet in my breast
pockets here what that seems strange to me but not you know not out of the not out of the realm
reason yeah like I wouldn't disown you if you were my son or anything but somebody like weird
I don't know I I never keep anything in my first office there they are there
but to me it isn't the bells and whistles the flashes that of course adds to it
but a star wars movie is made great when it takes chances and doesn't rely on callbacks
well you're in here on you know all right what what's the noise oh just you were making
a weird noise and I thought you were doing something I'm just having a a good old wank
him and you struggled to answer it quickly Rags he was definitely up to something that
is an odd that's an odd sound for Lincoln we can see right through that mess Jay it's an odd
wankin sound how did you have like a really crusty penis and it just whenever you that's the
that's it cracking yeah that yeah connections are you joking off chewing over there
yes our wars movie is made great when it takes chances and doesn't rely on callbacks connections
obvious directions it is made great when it prequels doesn't rely on obvious directions
oh he says doesn't rely on callbacks too it's like you do know that tlj had several of those
several blatant callbacks yes I'm sure that he's like those ones are okay though
yeah because he likes it that's that's what it made him feel remember when they go into the
crystal caves with the malay and falcon it's like when they went into the death star in the sixth
episode six remember crate not hot no it's salt no remember the guy that had to like
lick the salt to say that it's not salt did you remember JJ deciding to what up him with
nights of red cool those guys are scary oh my god audience do you remember those ones there
were that flashback once in the first they mentioned those like four fucking years ago and
just in case you forgot that was the thing that we brought up they bring in the sith
troopers in the same film that they're like remember the nights of yeah i guess
whoa why would the nights of ren attack kylo ren i thought they were like his
their fucking name is the nights of hey man ren is just like a code name
like like j if j was to train with them he'd become j-ren
it's not like they would be the nights of j or anything yeah that's a completely different
ren's reviews are in i remember rez review uh good times i just i don't know i just feel like
yeah i mean there's no fucking loyalty over the same shit the spirit and heart of star wars
the spirit of heart and star wars isn't in luke it's not in lightsabers it's hot and stuff yeah
i call that the spirit of we're about to get the big explanation so it's not in luke it's not in
lightsabers what is it not in the things it's not in lineage i would argue that it's not even
really in what came before the spirit of star wars is in the intangible pushing the boundaries
keeping an audience on its toes so that's shit wouldn't that just be the spirit of storytelling
at that point pushing beyond yeah that's if it's connected to nothing in star wars then why
would it be the spirit of star wars yeah if it's not specific to star wars yeah i would just say
at that point it's the spirit of movies or something i guess you can argue that like star
wars was always pioneering new techniques and stuff but that's like the technical thing yeah
and again i'd understand how that would be yeah just details right yeah that's not the payoff
that's just how the payoff star wars was like the whole didn't george lucas this whole thing was he
wanted to regress to previous forms of storytelling kind of yeah the um combining the hero's journey
with influences from western eastern all kinds of yeah but no that can't be true because that's
like a callback and that's not what right that's just details ranks can you stop that this is i
feel like him trying to define like the heart of star wars is like when you when people say they're
spiritual and you ask them what that means and it's like what oh it means like mystical it means
like energetic it means like core foundational you're asking what ssls is rocks instead of
madison rocks look pretty good have you tried them yeah don't breathe them but yeah minerals
menirels they have geodes again i want to think back to the fact that you said it's gonna get
misconstrued it's like you you couldn't have made this more complicated to understand like i'm just
sitting you're like i don't yeah if if you were a if you were a an inspire aspiring you could be
aspiring and inspiring but if you were an aspiring inspiring director and you got tasked with making
a star wars film and you watched this video to really help you encapsulate what star wars is
you wouldn't know what the fuck to do you'd be like uh i'll take risks i guess i guess i'll take
risks as well as you briefly highlight right when he brings up like mola about taking risks
or something you could just immediately like if he was here you'd be like so the prequels are great
right he'd be like hmm he's just saying don't play it safe which i guess i agree with i just
think that's almost a platitude at this point i'd be like oh you can't yeah you're not you can't
really do anything with this like you can't translate what he's saying to the real world in
any effective way it's all very vague i feel like someone get it very wrong too or at least
maybe misinterpret and be like all right i'm making a sequel to episode nine you know i'm
going to make ray an automatic villain just because i'm going to take the risk of making
her a bad guy you're like uh yeah i guess that qualifies as taking a risk i don't know
but then she'd have to have a character that's true i would actually approve
so you can have a character fucking stab her that too also if hello greedo's advice when taken
literally for whatever that means here can lead you to making an amazing movie or a terrible
movie then i don't know if that's really reliable advice well um i think he might even agree with
that like i don't know this is the thing i feel like he'd be in the tailspin trying to explain
this to anybody he'd just be like i don't fucking know i just i like i like it when they do the
thing and then you're like this thing that's in also this thing he's like no not that thing
a different the things i like if we asked all these people to just take let's just take a quote
from them and say explain what this actually means these words that you've strung together
they wouldn't be able to fucking do that and we couldn't explain it we still have a video left
who knows what he's gonna you're not supposed to listen to it you just hear it it feels like a
justification for how he really likes tlj yeah you can't you can't when you say it took risks i
mean like yeah yeah said hitler when he invaded russia oh boys that was risky that was risky
uh don't invade russia in winter can you just say that tfa was risky to have han and leah
broken up and their child is like a villain yeah and han is a loser yeah you can say it but i do
think tfa like plays it very safe so but if i could say it then i've said it there you go
here's the thing it doesn't actually but it convinces people that it is safe i mean
the safe part is that it's a repeat of a new hope right and that the idea is that people
will like that so it's safe is he gonna argue that the film that brought back palpatine and
confirmed ralo it was safe like this was the same oh that's what he's arguing jay yeah well
that's interesting is it safe to bring back palpatine because there's arguments for out against
that it's like you're fucking up the ot i wasn't gonna hate that it's like yeah but it's palpatine
people will love that i guess yeah i guess like both of them by a big board of corporates could
be seen as the like the safe decision you have to commit they think it's safe because they don't
know what the fuck they're doing they just bought it they don't care about it honestly it probably
did sell tickets right because they're like i know that guy that's palpatism yeah like absolutely
it's all tickets but also probably unsold a few tickets as well though like it definitely
affected a lot of people's decisions yeah i mean the tick that the in terms of money making how
sharply like i think the force awakens made twice what the rise of skywalker made
like their ending was half where they started and that's it's normally lower right like for
most like this but it's not normally that much lower let's uh
what can we compare it to the prequels are the most recent other example
right at this point you just need to know what risky means
shifting off a cliff
well risky for you that's risky for the victim this is really interesting actually star wars
episode one worldwide 924 million star wars episode three worldwide made 868 so like wow
that's pretty darn close yeah but it's half between episode seven and nine it's like half
let's see if we can find another one made more um oh no rogue one made the same as rise of skywalker
would you go rogue one safe yeah just over one billion dollars
i'd say that rogue one is quite safe actually and i don't know i'd say that
i think it's safe sure it doesn't fuck around with anything it kills all the the main characters
which is yeah but we never had them it's not a yeah but it's not like a it's not a very
self-contained yeah i guess um but they know that if we kill them off it's fine because they
were all self-contained is solo saying film is so how much that's the uh solo thing solo the
film that everyone's like wait which one's that it's like oh right oh my god the solo box office
was 393 million oh worldwide oh my god that's worldwide 393 why wouldn't you google star wars
box office do you get all the star wars movies then guardians of the galaxy two and planet war
for the planet of the apes well that it's kind of star warsy with the with the apes if you scroll to
the right it just doesn't stop it's like these are all star wars in black panther incredibles dude
yeah basically power rangers now that makes sense grjo and power rangers they're like aquaman
if you like star wars you'll like aquaman yeah uh so the force awakens made 2.06 billion
rise of skywalker was 1.05 billion so basically and here's what the biggest difference between
two films was between the fort uh the force awakens and the last jedi there was a 700
over a 700 million difference i found out that if you if you google that when you google a certain
kind of movie and it shows uh like the list right under the google search uh it shows like its list
of movies from google you can click one of them and it'll you know what i mean right no where
you've got like it'll show like a poster for each of the movie and then the name and then
you know you know exactly what i mean no google like 2019 movies and you'll see it no yeah i know
we mean 2019 google best movie reboots it lists among other things the mummy 2017
oh ghostbusters 2016 oh man of steel oh no ninja turtles 2014 oh no the amazing spider man
fan force dick what fan force
terminator genesis oh my god incredible hulk
they even have the godzilla with matthew broderick in here
we need to eat movies that hitman agent 47 that's not even a reboot that's the worst one
they're all the worst terminator dark fate star trek into darkness
uh the pink pant though i i like that never mind i saw that uh one of the newer comments when i
went um to my like home page on youtube where someone had commented um you know jj uh created
some amazing films with star trek but he really dropped the ball with star wars and i clicked it
because i was like there's no way he got away with that there's like loads of comments being
like what the fuck are you talking about you ruined star trek too oh jeez well i'm sure it
i'm sure that after jj star trek will be fine yeah and especially with that that p card i've
heard people are really enjoying that terrible shows back to back don't people love p cards
also the std yeah they wouldn't make two terrible shows consecutively of course not that would be
terrible people are upset that we don't have any star trek interests because they want to see us
rip into picard yeah it's not like the best thing about star trek now is a thing that's
literally designed to be a parody of it that's yeah yeah the orville is pretty great you should
watch that too jay if you haven't yeah jay i haven't seen that no he hasn't even watched
oh yeah people are upset that you were in the uh season five of tng you haven't watched those
other efaps right jay could have watched no oh yeah i watched the efaps yeah what no why
damn it oh wait i actually also haven't watched the prestige that's why i was quiet
when you were talking about it just try and forget everything we said and then go watch it
okay you but when a movie is spoiled for you and you don't have any of the
retain it you don't have any of the what the cock yeah when you don't have a cock oh no
sorry we can worry i'm making a couple of assumptions here i'm sure you're okay with it
jay you've upset all of chat they're gonna want to kick you dude and i won't be able to stop them
what have they said they've said for fuck's sake jay what the fuck jay why jay why is this
like exile exile jay the efaps but didn't jay you disgusting man jay is being sexist ban jay
yeah crunchy jay jay crunchy jay jay is offensive die jay jay to the crew like
no that's german for the jay uh okay fair enough right then um we were watching a video
yeah we're pushing the boundaries keeping an audience on its toes the spirit of star wars is
found in story did the star wars prequels continue the spirit of star wars i mean shit
an entire generation argued for a very long time that they did not but you know they did
all right
okay
i don't know what what is the conversation here
you have to define the spirit of star wars if you're gonna make a claim like why even start
there the second you like if you ask me he's like what is what is the spirit of stars are
like can you ask me that a different way like what is that question i mean like i'm imagining him
addressing like the uh the the israel palestine conflict by just going a lot of people don't
really uh this has been a better discussion for a long time but it's the answer is just this
they said no but it was okay
because they pushed the boundaries they created something new everything is new
yeah the first time anything you can't create something old
i'm gonna put that in the next gedel yeah you can't create something old
so people hate new things that are bad they love new things that are good it's almost like the new
part isn't really the part that's important it's the good and the bad part to steal man
i assume he's saying that it's something distinctive from what it wants what it's not just a rehash
yeah like like not a tfa i'm assuming he's ripping into tfa instead of new
yes yes that would be the process of steel man again yes yes well no it's it's i guess it's
just the process of not taking him entirely literally and assuming what i think he
well you you just restated what he said with a different word
which would classify the steel man right no not if you're not no not if you're you haven't
explained why his position's good well it would be a steel man because he's changed his argument
from new to distinctive this doesn't change the argument that just changes the word it does change
the argument yeah it does change the argument how the difference between distinctive and new
the words mean different things not in this context it's like not everything new that is
made is distinctive what do you mean and not in this context greed is only used the word new we
use the way distinctive it's made is automatically new but not everything is automatically distinctive
and the way that he's using it here for creating something in terms of star wars
yeah that's what we point out as being stupid though he should be using the way distinctive
but he's using the word new i'm okay with it yeah i know that's that's yeah that's obviously our
point i i would probably say something along like i if i caught that in my script i don't think i'd
be like you know i've got to change that it doesn't literally mean the thing and then you'd be efapped
and then you would fucking copyright strike us wouldn't you because the rebuttal that you'd use
for being who's doing that like atat chat oh yeah we haven't i haven't mentioned that um so
smud boy did a video on atat chats video i don't um like i i don't think i don't know that the
video was called video atat chat i don't have we ever covered anything about atat chat before
it wasn't really a name to me so atat chat any of you that's not annoying at all so he put out a
video called the throne room battle is amazing and smud boy watched it with um with glib evan shad
literature devil and uh shiny trooper um they i guess responded to it and um atat chat like
screenshotted it and said he can't wait to flag it and to bring it down and then it'll be really
great because this person clearly uses streams for revenue oh so they're a terrible person pretty
much uh and yeah the people called them out and fucking i want to find the tweet i want rags to
read it because he's this is gonna be tough for you man assuming i have haven't shown you this
before because right because falsely uh putting out copyright strikes is it's explicitly against
youtube terms of service and you could have your account you know deleted if you abuse
uh copyright takedown system so this is rags he didn't ask permission from shut up
so uh so someone said he says the guy who makes false flags against youtubers in reference to atat
and then rags you want to read out his tweet oh yeah sorry you mean a report on one channel
specifically smud boy that one claim i made after the guy made three videos which contained my work
without permission yeah i think it'll be okay yeah or use doesn't require your consent my dude i'm
sorry it's it's baffling to me considering his whole channel is based on star wars it's like
i'm sorry did you get permission off bob eiger he's like email you to be fair he managed two likes
from his 2900 followers it is amazing that anyone would have liked that tweet maybe it's his own
like i don't know yeah there's the star wars begs for your permission to use his clips for videos
yeah i it baffles me how you can have a channel that's literally based around i don't think it's
somebody else's well let's see the atat chat i guess his channel is called
let's talk star wars new content every week he's got a name for a channel on it it seems to all of
his stuff seems to be star wars it's all star wars okay i mean about details i wonder if in
every single description he has like written permission from bob eiger and uh and disney
as a corporation well these people just don't think the same rule applies to them they're like
i can talk about stuff that other people created but you can't fucking talk about stuff that i
created i'm above that rule that doesn't apply to me and yeah he was uh it was just it was funny to
see i was just like you i didn't know there was anybody left in the world who who thought this
like unironically it's like you can't talk about my stuff without my permission it's like wow
so yeah it's got like uh yeah that yeah my dude just you're not going to win this you're risking
your shitty youtube channel getting deleted because you're abusing the copyright system
and you know it never when it's telling you this so uh if you have a claim out you should revoke
that immediately because you're you're really treading hot water here with youtube i think
it was uh southpaw or somebody who made a tweet that was like at least matt jobber was smart enough
to try and hide how much of a piece of shit he was like yeah you're yeah just this is not a good
look it is not a good move for you you're not an intelligent person if you're going down this route
meanwhile hello greedo is totally okay with us responding to him yeah because he's a good man
he's you know you're still welcome to come on the show hello greedo we'll talk to you about details
and uh are you saying i'm really that guy i only murdered one star wars spirits and what it means
did an entirely new definition of what star wars could be and for that i appreciate them i would
take a move what can't be star wars yeah couldn't you just make a rom-com that's set in a basement
and be like star wars it's an entirely new definition of what star wars means right i feel
if you said that to me you'd be like no obviously so what yes i'd like to say this
it has to have palpitied in the corner of the basement like
that doesn't really hit me as much as i was hoping that it would hit me but it tried new
and interesting things over a as ryan johnson puts it a soulless clean homage i would never
call truss clean it is the messiest busiest pile of garbage it's the sweat underneath your balls
smeared all over every still
rise of skywalker made me a priest the rise of skywalker makes me want to take that one
extra wide step every once in a while just talking about
you know there's picture like avoiding a poop or something sure that's what i'm doing that's how i
play it off i i look at the ground but at nothing in particular and pretend as if i'm stepping over
it that's that's how i appreciate the last jedi even more because of this i also just have a deep
seated philosophical belief when it comes to creativity even creativity in star wars a deep
seated philosophical perspective on creativity wow i want to hear it yeah i would love to yeah
i would love to hear it and i do not believe that an author director writer whatever
i do not believe they should be hamstrung with what came before oh yeah yeah you already fucked
yourself yeah rules don't matter no there's no no rules no lore go back on anything you want
definition lord of the rings it's just pointless because he wasn't thinking about it this much but
i'm going to look at the definition cripple look look you can't say the cripple word not
2020 look jay so what he's talking about is the craft in that kamikaze scene right they got the
special effects ryan's like oh my god this is so good and this this fucking nude this this white
male walks up to and says excuse me then it doesn't make sense that you're doing it and then
hella greeter was like excuse me sir you're ham stringing our director our creator please
please realize that this is the spirit of star wars no i don't think so i think that doesn't
make sense imagine imagine luke skywalker came back in i guess the very end of tfa
day but naked he was in yeah and like an asian woman a translucent
right because after all there's there's no reason to hamstring the director of asian
where is the line well yeah basically the right place for the the line to be is like oh you know
um can we um give luke an arc where he becomes disenfranchised with the force um sure
yes from what he's established to be two where he's just this like completely different no
accounting that it's too risky it's too different from what came before that would be being hamstrung
by what came before agreed but yeah you know paying reasonable respect to it and making sure
that you when you say like i need my character to eat a sun you're like uh
who are they like Han Solo you're like i don't you know let's say luke comes back and his name
is like dave and and ryan's like i just think dave is a cool name they're like dave hamster
someone in what came before someone in chat mentioned game of thrones like imagine you
were writing game of thrones with these rules that this fucking galaxy brain hello greedo is
laying out here is his creative philosophy where whenever you make a new season of game of thrones
don't be hamstrung by all the things that happened before don't don't follow those rules don't don't
pay attention to anything like that just do whatever you want i would love to hear all the
reasons he didn't like the prequels and then i'd like to say did you pull it you're you're making
george lucas just just you're forcing him to be hamstrung by all of these annoying rules that
you've come up with okay star wars is more than that its spirit is more than that i i would argue
that he wouldn't be contradicting himself by criticizing the prequels because my guess is it
comes down to stuff like dialogue and yeah maybe i could couldn't just make the argument
this is quite a common one actually that the way anakin speaks is uh suitable for his upbringing
and that you're limiting what it is to have a character express themselves still contradict his
point yeah they're hamstringing the the the writer for the dialogue yeah but this is a different
point no it's the same it's a creator getting hamstrung did it
to
destroyed should have non-stroid so it's droids are better than sides you're a side i'm destroyed
no you're a side i'll fuck you up with my stroids it's like steroids you don't have any
steroids you think i said you lived every day not caring about anything that had happened before
um why does he think people see these movies because we don't care about what happened before
like i just want to see more space stuff
double path or outside pressure from fandom there is no one way to take things
i'm almost at the point where i'm like is the fandom even outside pressure really what do you
mean like a creator couldn't survive just fine with the fans being like i want this to happen
can ray be a base window like are fans really outside of the i mean is i mean i mean the fans
are so integral to you know star wars and its success and all that it's almost they're kind
of inseparable in this in this way they created it in a sense didn't they they created the phenomenon
that is star wars by being fans of it it's like if you're looked down at because you're a fan of
something like that's like the undertones of stuff that's you know the first thing you want to do
when someone makes a point like you shouldn't just count out to the fans i'm like is it that always
is a bad thing to do is it always a bad thing like isn't isn't ryan johnson a fan of the ot
isn't he making a film based on what he would want to see in a star wars film so yeah it's not
him kowtowing to the fans it's him kowtowing to the other fans or to a fan meaning himself
what if you have a really smart fan base who really understands the spirit of what it is
that the art you're trying to create no that's my character i was really waiting for that
well i feel like if if i got tasked with writing a star wars movie and creating a new star wars movie
i would go to the fan theories and i would go to the fan stuff and i would take advantage of
this vast inexhaustible supply of amazing incredible ideas and super turbo nerds who
know everything about the lore and use them as references all the time it just seems like an
obvious thing to me but these people just they don't even the nerd character i was kind of
referencing earlier like that would be a really useful almost like metal detector for plot holes
you could have on set you'd be like meh i don't like the meme man and you're like why it's like
because it's a meme man you're like oh fuck okay how do we fix it dude guy deals when you write
about a bunch of notes and you're like thank you nerd person i did a stream where i pitched
an alternative star wars sequel um with lego somewhere yes with lego and someone sent me a
poster of it and it was cool oh matt jarbo is saying that donald trump needs to take
accountability for the fucking retards and arizona who ingested fish tank cleaner
what i just i've already found it funny that he's like take responsibility
galaxy brain tanks my job thanks person needs to take responsibility yeah also that is funny
too as well yes in any event um i need to use the loo so buy me some time let's give them a loo
all right j explain to the people some of the memes in this artwork
it's not memes it's all good good fun it's all this is the star wars treacle
treacles this is star wars treacle characters
well i mean like this this whole like thought experiment started when i was like okay i saw
like them bringing back the stormtroopers and i asked fucking lazy so how would you get the
iconic imagery from the originals in the new trilogy but without just like fucking bringing
everything back and i arrived at let's say you've got a criminal and now there's loads of storm
trooper helmets just around because they manufacture the shit ton of them and he uses one of the old
ones to hide his face so you can have the iconic imagery without just fucking cloning what it means
something completely different yeah it's in a new context it's the old stuff in a new context
is luke old in your vision he is so he doesn't like the force then no no i knew it well i mean
it sounds pretty predictable that i predicted that means it's predictable so just saying just
disappointed they're just saying dude so long as i need major league to predict then it'll be good
when you're gonna uh you know start start filming uh the film the production began three months ago
but it's been put on delay because of covert 19 oh who's here uh he's just some uh he he created
4chan oh well not bad for one guy yeah it's just fine but i mean he's delaying my production so i'm
kind of a you didn't have to he just chose to yeah i mean you know we'll watch your career
with great interest she explained cheese lady i was to explain she's yellow and people cheese lady
i remember you were like she has an actual day but i couldn't be but i was like at that point
i didn't have the heart to watch because we all decided it was cheese lady so you've ever this
became a full-fledged project you'd have to have some reference to that like some lame character
calls or cheese lady or something i think i'm tempted to like make the pitch into a full-fledged
video or i get some like original art and other characters playing what you could do the whole
voice act did and then screenshots right yeah that's the kind of thing i'm tempted to do
wouldn't be feature length but it would be a i'm thinking around half an hour to an hour dibs on
voicing the marketable robot i'll allow that all right nailed it that's the that's the only
edition made by the artist who drew this i didn't put that in i like it though it's like a box with
two legs it is you got to have a cute cool droid that's how it works that's the spirit of star wars
do you know that i think that titty milk is the spirit of stables
his rags back yet
he's not back yet
should we kick on we're going to play like five seconds and then we'll probably be stuck again so
it's fine chris chan creates your full shot i'm surprised outside pressure from fandom there is
no one way to take things there's no one way star wars has to be i want to see what they have to
make i want to see what their vision of us i would just be so curious to take it to the nth degree
i just be like i'm back don't worry go ahead start without me it's all good what if everybody's
inside out did we do that people would be like hmm it's a bit risky but possible luke's arc is
about drinking come well isn't it already i mean only subjectively you thought that was milk
they had to you know they didn't name it in the movie did they that's a weird shape dick
yeah but aliens i guess star wars movie is i loved luke in the last jedi a man's entire
world view came crashing down a man basically you this is the i guess this is what he means by the
details like oh so cool that his will view came crashing down i was like why because he was like
the jedi were evil because they uh allowed the existence of emperor palpitina they trained
darth vader they're like wow that's really ignorant yeah that's really not fucking true
at all now isn't it all those words you say just they just aren't true none of them do you do you
know that they like were gates training darth vader is only because kwai god jin told his student
that he had to as a death wish it's like you know this and luke would be like and what do they do
the second they found out that trying to fucking mid in his office there were just some guys trying
that they showed up with a kill squad that that's that still disappoints me to this day kit fisto
gets fucking blooped like immediately does he have any lines in the films probably not do you
remember when he pushed over c3po and smiled in attack of the clones that's that's peak kit fisto
that's his only other scene like i said peak kit fisto getting each of the because two like jedi
masters on the fucking council get wiped out by palpitine the second he gets up from his chair
just like to have you guys suck wouldn't it be good if there were established characters who
had lines and they like were defeated by him in in proper like combat and a jewel that you care
about imagine like the the mace windu death scene played out like it does in the video game version
where anakin blocks his sword with his sword and then you have a boss fight with mace windu
did you know that happens in the ps2 video game version you have to like straight up
fight him or palpitine in the background like i'm picturing like a version where palpitine goes
around and kills them subtly and stuff i imagine that's how it went down like he just went and
visited each of the jedi and they're like chambers and just fucking noted them while order 66 was
going on because he was like i'll i'll be the only one powerful enough to knock out the masters
yeah damn you know you could have done a lot of stuff with the prequels that could
could be better could also be worse you never know he's like he's like slowly like jedi getting
killed in the background he's like oh my god how is this happening you know for the whole thing like
up to order 66 and what's the most powerful jedi right the way he's like okay it's time
that'd be cool goes through like he runs into mace windu's room he's like you must help they're
killing all of jedi help but then mace windu's like what you mean and then and then he turns
around he just dabs him so that'll be boring people want to see mace windu fight oh yeah
remember when hulk dabbed in endgame wasn't that awesome i actually turned around and i actually
think it's kind of funny now like it's supposed to be it's it's it's the most self-aware dab in
media i've ever seen it's it's like it's played off as a cringy scene of like an older guy trying
to see even fucking film what jay you disappoint me can you just say this for every dab ever
no like most of them aren't self-aware are they not at this point
yeah see you you gave him pause for thought there rags and all you did was just ask him
is it oh fucking tell me about minecraft stairs fight me oh shit you're ugly shitty stairs i think
that's all right what's that sound hang on i can hear something it's the sound of goalposts moving
no it's the sound of silence because ugly doesn't make any noise what
it's a new efap rule ugly doesn't make any noise speaking of ugly look at it luke's outfit
yes the shammy suit he should he should have brought like a
chunk with him it makes his titties look pretty big yes he got this belt all the way up to his
tits he's got yeah he's probably got some he's got some jedi text in his breast pockets
and what is with the shredded leather he's got over his hoodie this whole outfit doesn't make any
sense are those the only clothes he's had hey jay you know the you know the the reference to um
fortnite in endgame that was good because it was because it was self-aware yeah wasn't self-aware
though that one was not that was so self-aware like when he said when he said like new master
69 yeah that was so self-aware though why are you doing this because that's why it's good now
because it was self-aware yeah new master 69 yeah it was new master 69 the dab is like played off
as cringy you it's it's a cringy scene like deliberately yeah oh you think the the overweight
thaw yelling at someone online isn't supposed to be self-aware cringe it's not self-aware that
it's fortnite yeah that's not the only part of it that's cringe don't you understand you're not
you're not understanding the 4d cringe i don't know i want to see what the chat is saying
once he sees up once he sees the chat disagreeing with him he'll instantly abandon the chat jay
wants you to help him can you believe this jay is looking for you to help him no i'm not
you will you will find no safety it just says chris ray chan
uh the force of cringe jay when the emperor gave us gave his reveal speech in fortnite
that was self-aware cringe though it wasn't i i'm with mauler on this i think that's self-aware
self-aware cringe yeah i think so three to one no one loves you jay
cj is right there we go yeah because you agree to this now right
no oh they probably thought that that's what you were saying that's why they're saying they agree
do you go exile jay now after you said that
you know i don't know hey jay you know the room self-aware cringe
you're an expert mark
and who older and wiser realized the failings of an organization that he once tried to revive
cynical and broken not to mention god damn mark hamill acted his why do why do people when they
say god damn they they censor out the god part not the damn part which is the actual swear
part of it i was supposed to say like that is such a low tier swear damn damn okay if we're
comparing god to damn one of those if you were a toddler and you said damn randomly your parents
would be like oh this is not socially acceptable but if they say god they'd be like oh this guy
is a sweet jesus come i love for my obviously damn is is the swear word compared to god
why why they don't say damn in children's tv shows oh then again they don't say
like vasectomy either but you give to go to his vasectomy i there are many scenarios in
which that would be relevant to something like i could see that in an episode of you know
teletubbies vasectomy just popping in you never know well vasectomy is the name of a character
yes um so yeah his first name is vas and then his last name is ectomy so it's always direct to me
shared this so on that video we we watched the first the thing with the quote from the darth
maul uh character someone called that a straw man and said mauler has never said your feelings are
invalid how about you watch his videos and listen to what he's saying his videos being too long isn't
an argument uh hey rex do you want to do you want to read out what he said assuming i'm talking
about mauler yeah assuming assuming i haven't watched his videos and assuming i think they're
too long then making arguments against my position based on those assumptions jeez that sounds an
awful like a awful lot like a certain argumentative fallacy motherfucker you took mauler's picture and
you blurred it out hey man assuming he's talking about me and then constantly multiple times use
the straw man version of what people think that we say it was long though did he say long i don't
know that's what i'm looking at now yeah instead of assuming i think we're too long yeah but like
did he say long in his video he was no guys he was being a self-aware cringe right there
good job make stuff for being self-aware cringed you almost fooled us for a second almost no one
could actually be that fucking stupid i just like the idea though that he's like you've made videos
in relation to my position being argued against therefore saying feelings are invalid it's like
you do get that like if i said i feel that although didn't endanger anybody by not sharing
her plan i'd be like oh that's like demonstrably false it's like yeah but that's my feelings it's
like oh i feel like the earth is flat now what that's provably wrong we're talking about art rags
art art is there's nothing provably one way or the other if it's in a movie it's okay yeah
if a scene happens in a movie it's not actually happening in the movie
make stuff is self-aware cringe all right good stuff self-aware cringe bro
when i saw how luke was in the movie i had zero feelings of he wouldn't do that i i just don't
have that bullshit bull fucking shit what do you mean i believe that what the fuck rags shut up
okay so cringe listen listen listen what happened with the film they did that thing so watch
together has a problem the problem is that when you go to click on the play and pause button
it sticks on the the bar like the the the draggy bar thing for the timeline
you said back to the beginning it's what you're saying yes yes i did because i because i i'm
looking at my cursor right now it is not nowhere near the line but the line circle is still up
and playing so right that is a failure of the ui you made a mistake i didn't make a mistake this
is a mistake of the ui because i'm clear my self-aware
in fact let me see if i can show you how far down you could drag your mouse pointer and have it
it doesn't matter you're experienced with this ui this is episode 70 something nope i think i
think rags would probably argue it's not consistently pooped i'm assuming yeah i wanted to
save the cursor let me go to options so i can show you just how terrible keep the capture a
cursor on screenshot all right excellent okay because i want to show you the computer
says the guy with fucking one monitor okay so it's not it's not saving the cursor specifically
i told it to save the cursor part of the computer idiot yeah is you need to watch spider verse and
you'll learn that spider verse is gonna get a sequel and it's gonna be good okay actually i
believe that they should do the tom holland toby mcguire rancher garfield spider-man
and if one of the characters dies they can go to their funeral in the spider hearse
how long have you been sitting on that joke oh seconds that was fucking that was just he put
it under his ass and then he pulled it right back out philosophical well uh yeah uh oof
we're we're just being spontaneous right now
so i can do it there's no one way star wars has to be i want to see what they have to make i
want to see what their vision of a star wars movie is they're like imagine somebody making
a star wars film that's completely just actual total garbage like i said rom-com in a basement
with two i don't know like just in chicago random people but they have like barely any personality
but you just go star wars episode 10 the basement okay this is very back to us in chicago
it's very vacuous just oh um it's good because it's someone's vision but what is the it's the
vision though what if i mean what if he said to jj's face like i don't really like that you
didn't have your own vision for tfa and jj like it was like no no it was it was entirely my own
vision i used uh you know a new hope as a bit of a framework sure but i had all of my own
interesting characters and stuff and i wonder if a hell of a grid would be like okay well jj looks
at him and says dude don't you understand tfa was self-aware crazy dude i would love to ask him
under your criteria is it even possible to have a bad star wars film yes if it doesn't have vision
yeah he's gonna say if it was like it was a soulless clean copy that's a bad one but that
was their vision that's not a vision that's a that's taking someone else's vision playing it safe
yeah god rags you're not following this but what if my vision is to play it safe
because that's not because i because i adore what came before it that's the lack of vision
shut the fuck up idiot you will pay the price for your lack of vision i could use any of his
arguments pretty much verbatim to defend any version of star wars that could ever possibly
be made even the basement rom com why did you post that would be the best cut really
yeah that's not that that's nothing this is you you you're not even gonna go for lack of
vision you could put a cross on his face no this is what makes films good guy in chat he posted
a picture of vision in our chat that's that's that's j level self-aware cringe right there
uh i can't wait for the self-aware why did you why did you post a why did you post a picture of
dryden vos nice nobody's gonna get that no one remembers that movie right that's why it's his
favorite star wars movie solo is amazing it has its own vision that's why i like solo so much
it's not a copy i understand his makeup because he's the leader of the crimson don
oh the crimson dawn that is such a cool bad guy they that is like fucking xbox 360 halo
two gamer tag name man it's the phantom cloud it's the halo three sorry halo three x to terminate
that's what they call it right they probably cut it from that rap name generator we were like
what's your favorite color crimson
what's your favorite time of day dawn he was gonna he was gonna put midnight
but he was like ah even i've there you go that's another one we'll go with
midnight store crimson midnight oh my god the crimson midnight would have been a yeah there you
go there you go that's self-aware definitely so many crimson was so hard to believe that all
those 12 year olds back in the day on xbox live were so self-aware with their cringe they were
they were a hotbed of creativity they had their own vision you're ever using me joke now that's
pretty cringe wow give it a self-aware but i know it's i know it's cringe that's the point
j this is all happening because you defended the fucking hulk dab you understand that
yeah it's good you put a shield in front of the hulk dab this will follow you until your grave
it's the best dab in all of cinema i want everyone who watches the stream if you have to come away
with a single thing i'm sorry name a better name a better cinematic legolas legolas yeah did he dab
are you kidding he dabs every time he shoots somebody oh i just watched his films is it
self-aware no that's an archery joke i mean i got it i don't he he doesn't want shadow
versity so how would he know i said i i think i think that what i said was funny but that's okay
if no one else i'm sure some people in the chat there's a few it could see some long a few people
who know that every archery is just dabbing before you shove a stick in somebody at a distance
somebody's what well that's what that's what a bow is it's putting a stick into somebody at
a distance i thought you said putting it into someone's distance i was like what is their
what no jay oh my god
i don't actually have a bow sorry i'm getting just tight for the rest of the stream i have like
20 guns but i don't have any bows jay's posting cringe get a crossbow look jay's defending this
guys look at this horrible jay's defending the hulk dab i want everyone to understand and process
no we're past the hulk dab now we're never past the hulk dab especially because past doesn't
mean anything when time travels well no but actually that is set in 2023 this yeah that's
true but it came out the hulk dab is set in 2023 but in the context of understanding the meta aspect
that it is indeed a movie it doesn't matter it's already happened oh there's a photograph of it
right there no okay i want pry baby bitches who got spoiled oh my goodness uh jay like this is
your mag you need to make a video just defending this i think at this point to really make your
position clear in defense of the hulk dab on april fool's day do it on april fool's day but
you're like no i just i i was self-aware cringe that it was ultimate video defense
i didn't even realize he was doing it until just because he did it completely fucking wrong
he's not very good at it because he's you know someone's telling me that crossbows are
self-aware cringe i don't i don't think so maybe i'll i guess i'll find out for sure when i get
called angry bows idiot angry bows yeah guys you know you've been listening to hello grito it's
disgusting what's to listen to he's not talking star wars movie is i loved luke in the last jedi
all right a man whose entire world view became crap i listened to him i've decided i don't want
to anymore i i was like i'm with you guys now we don't have to listen to you guys are right all
along did you just draw this or no i found you because he's being forced to dab by filmmakers
like jay listen this is jay's jay's shitty creative vision is that whole fabs well lisa had vision at
least it wasn't just a no there was no vision in that movie vision wasn't in that movie i like
that his abs are just another set of pecs he's got so many mauler this better be on the screen
nope never i wouldn't curse the stream that way i loved luke in the last jedi a man whose
entire world view came crashing down a man who older and wiser realized the failings of an
organization that he once tried to realize their failings to masturbate when he has like no context
for their failings i can't believe that he fucked up so royally and he's like you know what this is
the jedi's fault exactly like this this should have been the story this definitely isn't a me
thing at all this is the jedi's fault because i remember people being so happy with the idea
it's like oh yeah the jedi finally getting like audited from the prequels by someone it's like
but he is like no that's not even fair like the idea that like oh they're too emotionless i'm
like okay this is something we can talk about among all of that but to be like they're the
reason the sith won it's like okay if we're gonna start auditing factions for the retardation
i'm sorry but i think the sequels both sides are gonna be coming up short well that's the
funny thing about him he's like oh there's you know sith jedi's whole shit it's like i think i
think there's something of a line between them you know i i tear them differently imo i am me
personally that's what i would have to say to him i think i think the first order's got a lot of
explaining to do yeah just a bit revive cynical and broken not to mention god damn mark hamill
acted his fucking ass off but i beat he he said said ass but not damn wait how can you guys tell
that was ass what kind of fucking turbo version are you thinking you're so edgy because you said
damn he has a kid idiot well do you do you think he said rectum instead of ass what are you what
are you trying to get at jay i was saying like he bleeped it so how can you tell what word it is
that's the point of bleeping a word so you can't hear it let's see what other words could possibly
fit that moment clinical and broken not to mention god damn mark hamill acted his fucking ass off
like right here you can hear the example this isn't a good example to use of his amazing acting
yeah i don't really care i just like you stroke it out right here
i mean why not he's a ghost he's not really doing it
but yeah you could definitely tell you said ass jay submit an alternative what could it also have
been atmos what the hell does that mean um short short for atmosphere which is an insult to many
people's atmospheric emission system yeah oh have you ever had someone call you an
atmospheric emission system yeah it felt bad yeah it feels really bad yeah when i saw how luke was
in the movie i had zero feelings of he wouldn't do that i i just don't have that impulse i'm curious
i'm curious what i could do to play with that i just have him like murdering children from the
opening and i go bear with me bear with me i'm gonna i'm we're gonna we're gonna explore this
and then he like becomes the leader of the first order and then he's like nah and kills
snoke and saves the universe like so do not have that impulse he's like and everyone's like oh
remember last time you saved the universe it was the same thing his dad killed kids so of course
you know i don't have i don't feel anything about walkers are just a bunch of child murderers
it's genetic which is now i think we've established a pattern i don't think we've
ever seen a palpatine murder a child which is why they need to uh step up and take that
oh my goodness palpatine well let's see and ray took the skywalker name so now she's cursed
to kill children i have to truly do what makes me a skywalker and slaughter children with my sword
it's been hilarious okay if you're self-aware but like it it it almost feels like he's trying
killing kids what are you talking about it sounds like he's trying to commit children that's pretty
cringe bro you know what you know what people never say yeah it's school shooter total cringe
self-aware cringe a lot of school shooters are quite cringe just like as well as being school
shooters they're cringe to begin with and then they become school shooters it sounds like he's
essentially a school i'm not a shooter but like a school slicer you mean ben solo you mean anakin
yeah anakin he said luke he was a school slicer luke i mean he almost was oh true he wasn't his
heart he wasn't his heart yeah he wanted to be a school slicer he wanted to be a school slicer but
he got he didn't have the courage that anakin had he hesitated we just had a moment
it is had in his moment he and that's why he's just like he was the ot he hesitated to kill
vader just like he hesitated to kill an innocent child he made it all the way to the finish line
and he just tripped damn it's a shame um yeah it sounds like he's trying to gun for a humble brag
he's like yeah i just you know i don't you know i don't ruin movies that way i don't go like oh
this character should be doing what i think they should be doing it's like yeah you do
you don't get invested in a character if you don't have a preset in your head of what
exactly kind of person they are how would you be invested in the first place like oh yeah i like
this person because they're a blank slate that can do anything it's like um like ray i like someone
but not really information or memory there is something that luke could do that he'd be like
luke wouldn't do that this just hasn't pushed his butt yeah that's what i that's what i think
if he was being 100 honest he'd be like yeah he didn't do anything i thought that was out of
character and i'd be like yeah i know so i guess in that vein it's interesting to think about
that there are things that some people couldn't do but we'll never know what those things are
anal is that true though like yeah we would say that luke couldn't possibly kill one of his own
family right set a character oh my god what if like what if that's what got Han Solo and
Leia to break up is that he really wanted to do anal and she just wasn't she wasn't into it no
she really wasn't into it but he was like but statistically women come more through anal sex
and but she's like no i don't imagine like at the at the heat at the moment he's like
i want to fuck you like the empire fucked all dron she's like um that seems inappropriate
he's like no you're the old probe droid and that didn't didn't work yeah i just have a long drawn
out scene you just have a long drawn out scene with star wars characters talking about anal i'm
sure you won't have any problem with that yeah that's the kind of shit we would have to test
about that he'd probably be like okay no that's too far we'd be like oh it's it's i think it's
very clear that if you read the subtext that the only weakness that leia organa had was a small
vulnerable thermal exhaust port nice at the end of the trench oh no i do not feel that level of
ownership i do not believe that level of ownership so they always do that they always do that
you don't own the character the character doesn't belong i think i actually have that line in my
april fool's video so thank you greedo for making me look like i'm a prophet i'm not so entitled
that i have opinions that are negative about things well that's the thing right i would just
ask for i would just rephrase all this shit to defend the prequels from anything he said
critically about them things like you know you think that the dialogue for anakin is unsuitable
well i don't i don't lock him in like that i don't take ownership and prevent him from speaking
the way that he wishes to things people can literally be whatever they want to be or don't
want to be at any time anakin was old whenever okay old and they called him a boy i feel like
hello hello greedo talks like someone who lets another man cook for the girl
what's interesting too is that when you look at the rise of skywalker in c3po him having his
memory wiped is basically him dying as a character um but that is all based around the idea that what
came before is what kind of determines what you are yeah because that's how people work because
he's wiped as a droid right that's just still c3po it's like well no because it doesn't have his
personal desires and you know reactions to things but no it doesn't matter i don't take ownership
over characters exactly so if what he says is true then c3po is not making any sacrifice
whatsoever in the rise of skywalker i mean why would you tether c3po to his memories like that
by what came before i mean if people can do whatever they want for whatever reason whenever
and fine because you don't want to you don't want to constrain the creative vision do you love how
there was no scene where they were like oh my god we got c3po back we didn't have to sacrifice
him they didn't give a fuck it would have been like he's like i got my memory back guys i heard
that you guys have to like delete it in order to win the thing and then ray's gonna be like oh
yeah i guess on a a slight non-sac with uh i've just seen i'm on i'm on the youtube on the make
stuff reading the comments uh and i saw you're on the what videos wait repeat that yeah i'm on the
make stuff video reading the comments and i saw in the related videos the least appealing video
essay title i think i've ever seen oh no the lighthouse twilight and masculinity
i'm going to do a video on twilight masculinity and there's no masculinity
the light right no masculinity
what the hell i don't know it could be a good video you fucking know but like oh i don't want
to watch this k and skittles yeah your video isn't masculine enough for jay working title
for gedel for the lighthouse twilight and masculinity unless something better comes up
because that is wonderful he wouldn't do that i i just don't have that impulse i do not feel
that level of ownership i do not believe that characters need to be unshakeable statues who
remain the same ideal that's not where that's not this is the same yeah it's the same fucking
straw man that we hear time and time and time again it's different from a character changing
let's just do it back to him yeah well hello grado i think that some people i think people
have desires they have wants and they have needs and they don't they're not just anybody at any
time they're not just like han layer and luke are not all the same character as vader that's
actually a response to what he's arguing well but i i'm like the straw man is me saying that's
his position he thinks that no person can ever uh you know be consistent everybody is crazy nonsense
cloud people that's what that's what your position is and i'm sure he'd be like no
because like we've been given that straw man over and over and over and over again the
war is like you think the people can't change he's old he's old old people kill children did
you know i i just i feel like this kind of an incredible change to a central character
to star wars arguably the most central character it would be like if you took deserves more than
just discovering it like let's go theoretical here i'm not referencing anything that does exist
if you took toy story and made like would he not care about any of his friends and abandon
the kid that he was supposed to be with like if you did that oh no oh my goodness you're referring
you're you're not speaking hypothetically oh no oh no okay fine you're speaking hypothetically
if you made a sequel to terminator two and just shotgun to death the main character of the previous
film no oh no oh no oh no damn it mauler you're self-aware cringe i can't handle well i got no
more hypotheticals that was it dab on the storytelling fuck it how about you make us do
the scrap topic or something i don't know that would be best star trek series that
shows the main character and he's not really the focus of the series it's like but they
got bums on seats that's all it matters okay what else can i start it out with
media is dying like the world for a hooray
it would be like having luke skywalker giving up on everything like that comes to island to
die while his family are fighting a war to stay alive that's totally luke right there that is
luke to a t oh yeah when i see that i don't even bat an eye i don't take ownership of this
character okay i don't feel that entitled that i would have a negative opinion that a character
is acting out of character luke fucking strikes layer down when he comes to visit her he just
fucking kills her and he's like you're the reason war happens in the credits role i don't take
ownership of these characters i don't take ownership they do as they do there's an end
credit scene which is a new and a new and interesting take for star wars it's new
direction and it's just luke having a shit on her body
what what's the vision jay what's the vision for that i mean it's daring man it's about
the cycle of rebirth both her body and his poo are fertilizing that will bring life to
you creature yeah that's the end the start of the next episode shows a flower growing from that
no no look like her body is basically the same just a flower coming out of the poo he does it
in space right and they have that shot from tlj where she opens her eyes and slowly moves forward
into the poop it just just nicely it's it's really emotional it spreads all over it's like
a really soggy poop like it just goes ray us where's us to name she says i'm ray and then looks over
and says ray layer corpse poo flower oh see that then i would i would turn to hello greeter and i'd
be like you know it's great we don't take ownership of these characters and that they can be free
when i saw luke save the galaxy pooping on a deceased layer it's just that's just natural
progression what kind of a person doesn't see just complete 180s and everything that you
understood about someone and you're just like no no problem with that what kind of person can't
see the flaws of this argument this is like where do you think we can take this hello greeter
it's like everywhere operating in real life with real people with this outlook
and then luke picks the flower puts it on you know you know what happens in real life when
people do things that you think they wouldn't do from what you know about them is usually like a
big dramatic thing and people often be like i don't even fucking know you anymore yeah they
usually say that because what you did was something they didn't think that you would commit to that's
that's usually what's going on people are generally yeah imagine if the characters in the film
um reacted like that then at least it would be self-aware i mean what's the difference between
this outlook on people and literally having like short-term memory loss
it's kind of made me wonder like why wasn't leah more pissed at luke when he came back as the
ghost she should be like so you like fucked up our son and then you just abandoned us all
where did you go why did you leave us all to die and then he gives he gives her the dice and she's
like motherfucker are you serious right now and he's like what it's hud's favorite day this is my
ex my ex-husband's ex-girlfriend's memento fucking adis dice why did you bring me the ass dice
of corellia this corellian ass corellian anal dice corellian anal beads
oh wait i actually saw the tlj comments like the audio commentary of ryan johnson and he said that
he put luke on the island because he thought that luke hiding there was heroic like he yeah he did
no no ryan johnson's whole rationale for putting luke on the island was so that he was
he was trying to make the jedi new again and come from a better source
and that hiding on an island while everyone else is dying
no no seriously
and then he cuts himself up in the forest which is like locking the door
no one can force telephone me even almost decapitated my nephew and ran off like a bitch
oh i love the the by the way everyone should watch psa stitch's video uh on rhizoscopy i love
that what he pointed out about how luke's whole goal as a force ghost was to get ray to go and
fight palpatine he waited until she destroyed her own ship why did you do that he was there
watching it the whole fucking time he was a he's just like hmm this is pro well lucky i got my one
down it's like what the fuck were you doing this whole time what's she what's she doing with that
gasoline in those matches why is she putting that on the oh shit she's throwing the lightsaber no no
no no no well this won't stand yeah this is going too far that that was sort of mine but
kind of you know when she was like how am i going to get to palpatine imagine he was just like well
do what i did the teleport thing and besides he can't teleport he can't kill you if you're a ghost
right but he can't kill you while you're a force ghost would be funny if she if she was like won't
that kill me he's like no it's not gonna happen and you know it anyway back to hella greedah
holistic youngsters that they once were i just don't and when a character isn't what they once
were it doesn't set me off i am not you know i'm not in their head i'm not i'm sure hitler
had questions i'm not in their head i mean i mean stalin had a plan dude right he did everything
for emperor sorry no empire opens up they're on hawth and they're like the emperor has sent droids
to go find them and then they're like what do we do about these invaders just in the board room
with han and luke and he's like i don't know this is gonna be tough like we should probably just
try and stay low and they're just like i'm just planning stuff with him and he's also dating layer
at the time too and it's just like oh i don't remember any of this i don't is that and it's
like it's been three years do you think people don't change do you think do you think you're
inside vader's head do you think you know what his what his goals are as a person you fuck
doesn't this mean then um why would why is that where you went to me alive and unspoiled
oh that's a good reference high five uh what about uh in the the same movie so he's okay with
pointing out inconsistencies in in like the same movie right with a character i mean no that would
be a detail oh yeah maybe i wonder how many years i have to pass for him to be like yeah now they
could literally be anything they could they could raise like the rancor we see him again 10 years
later and he's just baby yoda and we're like uh three years he went through a metamorphosis it
makes sense yeah the curious case of benjamin rancor where he he gets smaller and younger as
he ages maybe rank him in then someone in the chat just said self-aware cringe with no context
oh my god they spelt cringe with a k cringy cringy cringy cringy cringy cringy cringy cringy
that's so fucking fast oh boss man not kneeling before an unchanged painting of what once was
taking a ride on what taking a ride on what is what is you have no care for yesterday
have no care for tomorrow what was the first half of that statement
you could go back we can go back i got i got the second half let's have a look at that first half
he says something about a painting my head is in a cereal bowl and i'm taking a ride on what
you know i'm not in their head i'm not kneeling before an unchanged painting of what once was
i'm taking a ride on what is when i saw luke and tl dude imagine living your life like this this
just no successful person i think has ever had this mentality and lived with it he's just saying
whatever so philosophical just no argument for whatever happens i accept like that's what he's
arguing yeah yeah basically i have no standards no expectations i accept any garbage that's put in
front of me and i just like then why didn't you like the right standards how can you not like
anything then no the rest goes bad though i'm not kneeling before a painting of what once was
i'm taking a lie on what is on what is it's so beautiful
complacency is hot i'm just picturing some guy at his pc like playing
fucking league of legends and we'll put this on the background he's like what the fuck was that
imagine imagine the film marriage story but both the characters just had this mentality
what lukes hello gritos god take a ride on what is just take a ride on what is just don't
don't worry about it it's it's all good like don't worry about yesterday or fuck especially
not tomorrow anything can happen and it's all good no matter what is it's a good make a ride
on what is it's a good message okay i instantly lost it as a creative decision it is way more
interesting to me than if interesting oh my god he's not actually he's gonna he's making an argument
good rather than for why anything is acceptable if he took his lightsaber and said i am luke
skywalker i will restore the jedi order i don't really like i would have the two options but the
risers yeah it's always those i remember that they're like oh you wanted him to bounce between
every 8080 and rip the wall in half it's like yeah that was that was preferable but it didn't
have to be there right what if you tried against fear for logs and just died because he wasn't
strong enough i'd like to see that empty climax no at least he died fighting no like it's okay
anticlimax doesn't mean a bad thing oh yeah it's played up as like you know it's a noble
sacrifice moment well he like he knows he knows what's gonna happen what if can you imagine luke
skywalker doing like the morally virtuous thing like why is uh uh can you imagine imagine you
turned up and he's like your audacity of the concept it's kylo battle me and then he gets
hit with a laser sniper through his heart and just flops over onto the floor and we're like oh
it's okay it was at least he died fighting his arms more than he does in tlj as he falls though
his arms do like resemble the dabbing sort of he just slaps it he pulls into it skywalker doesn't
bum me out like the last jedi seems to have bummed out so many people you know it is what it is
because we're like humans we're not borderline sociopaths you know just like oh yeah people
just change randomly for no reason and i will accept it i would insightful by the way it is
what it is so when people say it is what it is it's like yeah like tautologically there it can't
be any other way that's like a thing that people say that is unhelpful and is meaningless in every
way rax it is what it is to me most of the creative decisions in the rise of skywalker
are so insanely unimaginative and uninteresting once again the rise of skywalker made me appreciate
the last jedi even more as a movie the last jedi that's what he wanted to say missile just said
that like the rest of it was just more he explains himself the worstest point gets that's the opposite
of what an explanation should be so vacuous like if he said oh the rise of skywalker made me
appreciate and then he's like okay well feelings aren't uh you know you're not entitled to feel
what jay let him appreciate what is it is what it is can you even be a decent video essayist if it's
only five minutes with no details dude the the shorter it is the better according to them like
i spent you know 30 minutes talking about a stupid bomber they'll be like fucking hell
go to hello greeno he can explain why creativity is alive and well in the spirit of star wars in
five minutes and you're like right i didn't really follow it like this is all entirely motivated i
imagine this is not truth this is just my assumption he saw the film he was like man i don't like
where they took what i did like in tlj i would make a video about how that's how i feel i'm
gonna dress it up a bit because that sounds really bitter
breathes new and inventive life into what could have easily been a stagnant and predictable
sequel i want more of this and less of that how about we have less of boast
he lightning an entire fleet
lightning just like i predicted years ago just like we all saw coming dude nothing is changing
in this franchise fucking boom all those new force you could do this with uh i hate everything did
this ages ago he was like you don't want the force to evolve because of force uh skype it's
like could i just be like you don't want the force you don't want anything to evolve hello greeno
you don't want force heal you don't want force teleport items and objects you don't want uh
what else is it force memory ghost thing from being dead to being alive you don't want force
super lightning because that's way better than normal lightning dude it's been 30 years people
change he doesn't necessarily have to be dead anymore so he's changed every time i see his
book i start laughing because it's just it's as long as his videos just it's so thin his oh yeah
he's got a book i forgot about that uh dude fairly it's the title is good for this oh i see
what you're saying i see what you're saying thank you oh he's chapter two is why star wars
because i think in a moment i choose chapter in a book you wrote called supporter q and a
i i i choose to read it as why star wars
i don't know why he's writing stories about uh we're writing about his past and stuff
like it doesn't yeah it doesn't really matter and all that don't get hung up on all that
shit man it don't matter live for the now greeno live for the now oh yeah live for the now just
ride the now it is what it is did it yeah yeah it literally can it can't be any other way
that thing has to be what it is so that is correct yes i don't have to nut it is what it is
i don't have to know it do what it be
people don't feel like it do but it be but i do
so yeah that was that video i don't know what you guys think good pretty i mean
three out of seven like what's that code like what's that code the ability to speak
does not make you intelligent how dare you what he said what he said was insightful it
allows you to enjoy things beyond the details you're kneeling in front of a painting like
like he he said a lot of nothing basically yeah in your opinion
what he said that don't have standards for like things because things change and that's okay
my vision is that he it's a nothing burger somebody made spider j oh my goodness
it's kind of all those eyes and he still won't see lord of the rings oh god
that's that's such that's so well done draw like it so much time into that make it draw me
a dog so wait that's not a real picture of j
no i have more eyes you have four eyes this doubles the amount of eyes you have j
yes i also i also like this image um it's the eye was hacked alien
the eye was hacked alien yeah it's beautiful somebody draw me a bit as a dog yeah that would
be crazy they should do that coronavirus porn folder
see that felt like a non sequitur but hey i'm saving i'm saving the spider um image
and i nearly saved it into the the folder that i saved all the coronavirus porn in
oh no you'd just be going through just whacking off just hitting the the the scroll keys with
your left hand while you're just fucking going it and all of a sudden this thing pops up and you
bust a fat nut despite you or did mean to bust a thin nut oh like if like if he did it again and
it's like a sniper it's very precise in one spot no it's just not really yeah i've seen that one
together we're gonna do this to him one day once we can be asked
i like this one did you guys did you guys see this trolley it's on a path to kill 1.2 billion
people if you pull the lever the trolley stops and nobody dies however the trolley is delivering
materials to build a psyllium oh my goodness don't do it bob i'm so curious what would he say
are the people republicans yeah you need to know what the people are
are they evil are they bad do they have different political opinions than me in some ways
are they farmers die
farmers only.com is like hell damage the train if he goes to hell it's farmers only.com looks
like tywin's got some competition for apex homo
i don't know uh some of these you know you see them and you're just like oof
but jay jay needs this what do i need no
so you like allies with the isle of man flag at that point or i guess so
all right as you love the other man flag dancing together
i think this was when we were talking about the potential for ben shapira to play batman
what was when was that
oh i think the amount of crime that happens on a saturday would spike though
oh the mask looks different like i don't get how they've changed it to well
lit enab and i want to go in i'm tired i want to go in there and have a lit enab where they
they listen to efap to go to sleep it's very adorable look at this horrifying monstrosity
combination oh yeah that i love the phrase the rhino he looks so happy
get this fucker off my back i guess i have to do this it's threatening to hit it with
that lightsaber probably oh yeah your shad is on the shield i like it it's getting better
who'd have thought shades work with the gas mask you know yeah and the ears they really compliment
the hat the hat so somebody uh just wanted to show us like an example of someone wearing
the movie bob mitch i think that's quite quite hot don't you oh my god this is a cursed image
who would ever buy it i don't understand this should be on surreal memes like what a what a
horrible horrible image only makes sense on your picture patrick williams can't be a strong black
woman apparently not yeah he can he looks pretty doesn't look that strong that looks pretty like
scrawny and narrow and i can comment on that i have experience i think that jay could beat
up patrick williams i don't know that i'd want to beat up patrick williams no i i wouldn't want
to fucking touch them either but i mean like you could i bet uh probably rags in a single beer
single beer oh i got some i've never uh like purchased these for home consumption but the
other day i was at cvs and all they had that i even had really liked was just the cans of bud light
and that's what i've got right now cans of bud light like i'm a fucking redneck degenerate
ryze skywalker's trash at the highest order star wars falling right skywalker
they're both long the same long then mine is longer i win there's a lot of the same picture
memes for efap memes then they pour out remember this guy rags these are some old memes i've
collected oh yeah i do remind i do remember this guy in his fucked up shirt i do yeah
what the fuck is this and send us the nuclear codes i don't actually remember
relatable human things yeah he was on the sorghorn arch stream that was uh an adventure this is this
guy is this is kind of this dude's sort of like the perfect example of how not to present yourself
unwashed uncombed hair your face is dirty you're not shaved well he's completely fucked up his
shirt ratty and nasty like just just if you are going to use a webcam for anything or just just
go out and forget the webcam go out in public opposite this no you can't go in public what is
the context of this next one i understand decipher it all llamas i love llamas i don't know the
context of this but llamas are great there you go i enjoy i enjoy the presence of llamas and their
company i thought this was a corona thing because of the mask but ray learns to swim ray learns to
swim she's an expert sailor for living in that desert planet her whole yeah exactly i'm guessing
this is a directed by ryan johnson sort of thing i don't know
go space marine memes rags training to join the space marines
oh poor quinton i must be very strong if i can lift quinton he is uh he is probably a a heavy
boy i do not envy the floor of his bedroom mup never dies he fucks i think mupa no no he doesn't
no of course he doesn't fuck it just has to support his weight disnoid disnoid what the
oh does jay not know about disnoids
we found the ultimate disnoid we found a few to be honest with you but yes
yes he was he was a pretty high ranking disnoid there's lots of ranks this was uh this was a
result of how she responds so oddly to what he tells her he's killed
i can tell that lip man she wants to fuck she's into it yeah she wants to bone rags
yeah she wants to he's just providing you know the translation in case people miss it
yeah i'm human integral
oh man
wow i can't i can't believe that brown table sort of a chat here
he's the obi one did you hear the tragedy of darth kelly retran the social media
i think we might have shown this one before but it doesn't get it doesn't really get tired of the
whole incel uh in the criminal future there's no human the face jay getting ready for a night on
the town oh my god oh my jesus wow that's a five head jay don't you love it wow that's almost wow
oh that is just real enough to be terrifying harry potter's transition going well
when you cover most of it up it looks okay
is that what is what's the thing to the right of the body is like a banana peel
i can't tell that space banana
oh hey everyone should watch parasite
parasites good is this is a deeper joke like is there is relevance to who's what character
um i guess i'm the dad right rags and metal are the rich oak so me and me and jay are siphoning
off them i guess hmm i kill rags at the end apparently is that oh wait i shouldn't have
said that actually ignore that that was totally a joke you don't know some people haven't seen it
no you're confusing you're confusing that with someone else yeah he's right i've confused it
you actually are though there you go 100 people are gonna go into that movie thinking that's a
spoiler that they'll be surprised they'll be great something totally different and i'm like
oh wait i was worried over nothing the whole time but yeah fellowship of the ring one is still up
you can go watch that if you guys didn't even know it existed some it's it's some have called it
funny some have called it uh the greatest video that ever existed on planet earth and then you
go to towers one who said that return of the king i'll try and get out in the next couple of days
but that might be one of those efap movies that just keeps going down back up like doom doom is
still up now right you think of it 69 yes this is this is one of them one of them weird pictures
you know from the efap fandom where i don't want to make of it it's horrifying um
it's not even efap specific but i like it
i take it i'm pretty sure i'm the one who fucking posted that screenshot on twitter
decided like just like how atrocious she looks in that shot i'm imagining myself acting that out
and i can't imagine myself even making that face especially because you know when she's acting it
the lights she's only holding the hill there's not actual blade there so there is
yeah there probably isn't any plastic stuff when she stabs it through it no she actually stabbed
him for that scene it was it was real dedication and she actually force healed him wow yeah
can she force heal the franchise
not some this is beautiful
oh god oh my uh
molar is perfectly capable of acting like a decent human being but prefers to act like an arrogant
cork most of the time but yeah i'm also sick of having molar's bile constantly regurgitated onto
this sub as well clearly not content with presiding over his cult his noxious fumes must spread across
the film communities i can't imagine his constant online slap fights with other creators help
bears why does he wear the mask noxious fumes i mean it all makes sense not me i love him
that works i want to know what sub that is copy movie circle joke because they say that you're
like they're a big fan of my stuff aren't they yeah they love you you live rent free in the
collective heads
yeah there's a new movie that's coming out apparently chat is a main character
you're pretty cool chat j rags molar cat so this is uh
what is okay what does that say autistic claims and weird salad that he like he's killing me
braid drain commences that's what it says this is a weird one this is a weird one
oh this was a drawing of like me me as a doom related character because there's one for metal
as well oh my goodness um metal one the long iron man colors and this is the uh the mortal one
can i go i don't know if that's a visor thing or if that's his tears
i still need to play doom people probably want us to uh you have thoughts on that shit right
i should get around to it people don't care about your thoughts idiot how with
dareth you j especially after this coming meme of people caring about you being there for lord
the rings oh they approve of the hypothetical universe that didn't happen yes the coming of
meri and pippin remember that quote
oh yeah because throughout our watch um fringy was indeed golem
proto swagons down there
oh gosh what am i dealing with here
oh
your controversial takes gonna fuck people up you know that right i love that i love it um like
with you privately i've been through like the more reasonable version of why i don't like
space balls and then public them just like nah it's boring fucking because you're a giant troll j
that's what i'm fairly sure i've not like done the talks about like the whole Seinfeld isn't funny
trope no i'm naming the trope i'm not saying Seinfeld is funny some of these memes should be
unlike the the regals reddit and everything
fucking fake ass alfred over there
i don't even know if some of these are actual quotes from us or not anymore
it's just too many faps ago i should have done more memes
but the big book of big idiots this is a pretty basic meme there's no deep lore here
oh there's deep lore here yeah translated by scooby dubious
yes
someone print this please
i think that's an accurate photo
yes you know this one is relevant to efap mini it's undeniable
that poor man he has many addictions
did you ever see the the part of the efap where that happened uh any of you yeah i mean i know
you did i hope he was i'm glad he's okay no really i'm fine yeah it's fine just the house fell on me
wait did that happen what really well no well there's like he had like a shelf fall on him
but it sounded very violent the time we were just like oh my yeah we were like holy shit are you
okay you're like yep i'm fine i'm fine totally fine the current theory is that disnoids attacked him
i haven't really proven that theory wrong yet
yeah people found some of my uh my long man books out there i haven't published many but
oh wow they're out there hey i've read that i get points right no well a book about how
the pigs become people essentially instead of just all of a sudden they show up and they're
people without explanation huh how about that no sense why would anyone want to see anything
like that rex sounds all of the wrong oh look more lord the rings weed jokes something you're
loading this there we go we know you have some collectibles here and there go your three feet
this would be a surreal beam i think that's uh oh man if you weren't there this thing
won't make no fucking sense sci-fi show no shut up jay you wouldn't know
i i'm a big fan of surreal i'm an approved surreal memes poster so i'll have you know that
free sci-fi show
oh man it's the movie poster for movie bobs
in the kingdom of icing
oh how he's still fat as hell everywhere yeah you've morphed it's like the fat is so powerful
pushing the muscles he bends the very fabric of space and time around his most venerable
oh my i think it's me and rags reimagined as velociraptors and possibly it's the other thing
are we fighting just random soldier guys joker haters and tlj defenders damn i just got something
nice
there we go we got to say uh little spectrum here
memeable non memeable long man non long man
so the most on the the shortest not memeable person is mr gg i guess
and geeks and gamers and doomcock
and we are quite memeable and also longman yes cj is a filthy centrist i always shad not more
of a longman because he does shorter videos too lots of longman videos yeah yeah but i think it's
like if you do longman but then you also have a lot of shortman then that kind of brings you
down generally i think some gamers is pretty memeable yeah we don't have to agree with the
spectrum you know you know someone's opinion you know you don't have to characters can change over
time jeez yeah i guess doomcock isn't really memeable i like this image there's a lot to this
what the fuck mary pippin trying to smoke up fucking the ganja
what the fuck you doing in smoke up his relatives smoking my brothers they're right
they're so red they're right they're so they look so shocked yeah oh my god mary the tree is talking
you fucking been there man
man i like how we're infecting you know school tests and stuff with random squiggles
you should have studied harder what is what is that upside down is that two out of 21
that's 12 out of 20 out of 20 is that a two out of 21 what flip it upside down
but why would it it would be two out of twenty one
flip it upside down and it would be two out of twenty one it's a fucking joke first of all
but it actually does work no it does it does why would that be the only thing that's upside down
that's the joke what the fuck
it would spell zero two out of two one upside down which is utterly bizarre by the way
you're the only one who would you don't want drunk enough to notice that well fine i'll take the win
it's like zero two out of twenty one have you finally seen it well duh oh duh now huh
we get it we get it it's not a joke that's my
disappointed in all of you jokes are funny thank you jay they've got the little they've got the
little like you know a two has like a round a bit and then a sharp a bit the sharp a bit
supposed to be on the bottom it's on the top on these see molar is right chat chats on my side
high five chat that's a little self-aware cringe
if i was greeting you on that i'd say you got a two out of would you say it's good rat or bad rat
uh bad rat oh no
all right oh my god what do we got what do we got this is what we got
oh god uh i'm movie blob glow gabble lab i am the blob glow glad girl lab the swabble
lab i am the swibbly liver kind i am the yeast of thoughts and mind no
i am the donuts and i have the yeast of thoughts and mind that's the actual lyrics that's gross
that's i need yeast to make bread rise it's full of carbs that i could try
jay you said that you were the aliments ally what's this about the schwastika legs
yeah that's four legs man i'm not about that no that's three legs two arms that's five legs
two arms what monstrosity that's like this is a movie movie bobbit as uh as a certain character
why would someone make this
it's so disgusting
my name's babu frick i live outside of this crispy cream and dumpster it's got the shades
movie babu frick instead of going hey he goes republicans have stolen the life
oh
is that rags with my mascot
gas masks are good for everybody nowadays can't deny
oh god rags is gonna be so upset see this when he comes back
some some confusing shit to read isn't it
oh that's a window that's a window idiot
you can come into a house through a window and there's an open door policy
that's actually something fringy said lots of chat i thought it was very funny
why does it say fringy it should say frickman's soil
that's offensive to salty people
this is a reveal that whenever they're sort of thinking about you it's a bit of a duality
you know that's pretty gay that's racist racist memes
that's cute though
who has a hot take spider web coke is objectively good taxi drivers bad
space balls and blazing saddles are boring oof ouch you go
this when a bunch of Wakandans kidnap you and your family and steal their milk in front of you
jay is that like accurate would you say
he's coughing to death jay is this accurate would you say
yes yes i love that one i've seen that one
they successfully made the most exciting and addictive energy drink nota bag guy
i despise the spoken power milk what's the first one when a bunch of
Wakandans kidnap you and your family and steal their milk in front of you
oh hey look relevant how can we destroy that battle station they can jump to lightspeed and
hit the battle station there you go wait a minute would have been an interesting movie you know
it would have been a one in a million shot but they could have tried it several times with all
the x-wings
what's a great writer
i think this is watching the videos on youtube i have taken to saying boo about a lot of videos
these days
that's not like boo that's like boo like surprising
saying boo about a lot of videos these days you don't know that I like it's
also a rendition of me I'm not sure if they're both me and they're just
different versions different marks of my helmet if you will if you can call it
oh shit I forgot whoa see there's so many we've not shown yet look at this
shit look at what shit oh look at you look at you
why is it just say dragon because it's a reference reference to another meme
is that it's not like a holy rags there or is a good rat I thought it was me at
first because I am holy and pure however I think that's good rat that's good rat
why can't it be good rags were you good rat all along I'm guessing the pommel is
rags actually I'm the best boy yeah let's look she the like without think
the signature shades it's a little up in the air hmm this is me and literature

like ho ho ho I got you that's him laughing at them and backwards he's
saying Oh Santa isn't a communist he doesn't believe in the redistributable oh
yeah this one this one got made as well I don't understand how this happened it's
mr. medicare kicking J that's pearl no the medicare hat that's also power okay
combo of medicare and pill because like how did it happen what because medicare
does the the weatherman streams now right yep and he's in the pay up susan thing
because he's got demonetized so that's and this is hat so it's definitely
medicare why is he kicking you we've never had any far as I'm aware
maybe we have one I didn't notice he's losing his milk right oh does not look
happy it's like another day another day he has I mean J's just trying to take
him to the vet fix it scoliosis the part the fact that it's pal as well oh
these are two sorry I'm just moving on cuz I hate you yeah what are you waiting
for I don't know about the Lord you fat part two I guess it will happen that is
slated to happen next week but you know that these things work we're hoping to
have it happen and then this one which is awesome
it's reference to the fellowship of the ghettos doing in the majority of the
films spinning around doesn't know where he is fighting people who aren't there oh
which leads us into risk demographic from coronavirus no reason no he goes past elderly
he's like seven thousand years old or whatever that's that's above 60 yeah but it's also
past like the cap of like however long humans have ever lived it's like 200 I think so once
once you pass that you become immune again I figured you knew this Jay Corona expert
all the still and yeah it like flips back again it's like 200 200 sort of thing how
old so it's like every 200 is off and on so anyway we got a video to cover is everybody
still alive excellent because you know if you've only really done the first quarter
of a stream right you all agree that good good you spoke the same time I understand
yeah we listen to great music what we listen to Rebecca Black's Friday on the regular because
my god creatives deserve to not be hamstrung by previous conventions of what makes good stuff
okay so anyway this one this one's called in defense of rise of Skywalker in the thumbnail
is called that and it's called why I loved rise of Skywalker a response to everybody everybody
that includes me rags Jay and the other two you guys are like yin and yang I'm gonna you
you're the doggo I'm black on the inside wait oh god it opens up straight away with a tweet
that's not what penetrates me the force awakens was about reigniting nostalgia and inviting new
fans to old myths the last Jedi was about how nostalgia is a trap but if you can let go let
it go you can build from its memories new myths rise of Skywalker is about two hours
oh damn that insult right at the end there rise of Skywalker is about two hours long
that's funny that's funny I mean I'm okay with it but you can you can draw tisms out of rise
of Skywalker if you wanted to rise of skywalk I mean draw tisms out of the last Jedi you can
draw tisms out of anything I mean the last that I gave a guy to its own tisms of the movie
fail you're the best like shut up Yoda you don't know you don't know shit now I burn your house down
but yeah I mean this would be pretty upsetting to read as someone who really likes the rise
of Skywalker you ready to find out why I am sure
also that was Fred Coppersmith who said that very very trusted source
oh god when people talk about Star Wars they talk about their childhoods their best memories
the people they loved and shared it with the rise of Skywalker brings back all of those feelings
and then some I absolutely love it and now I feel oh so this is a positive one all right good for you
oh
the only thing Star Wars fans hate more than people who quote dude this is this is a weird variation of
it the only thing Star Wars fans have investment in things have invested in things yeah but the way
they phrase this the only thing Star Wars fans hate more than people who hate Star Wars is Star Wars it's
like what I mean a thousand people retweeted that no like yeah I agree well it's like it's
stupid meme nobody hates Star Wars more than the Star Wars funny thanks Demi I did you Yigby
that's racist probably people care about saying well that's what your people's words isn't it
yes uh yeah what about electromon electromon
is that a pokemon it's an electro lemon
I prefer electromon
it's like a robotic creature that uses electricity
excuse me uh waiter I will have a seat I'll have some of the orangulo it's like sure that's orange
jello I mean it's a it's a fair mistake all right I'll also have some lemon lemon jello
I was like that's lemon jello sir go electrolomon electrolomon electrolomon
I like the idea that if anyone's is like curious to see the response to this video that's what
they scad to they're like oh I feel like they will be drawings of electrolomon
but yeah I was just I wanted to point out obviously the the people I think the statement is
wrong the most the most people I find that hate Star Wars are people who've never seen it before
and don't care about it you know they're the ones that really hate it because yeah the people with
no investment in it whatsoever are the ones who really have emotional ties to it you just hear
them all the time they'll soapbox like I fucking hate Star Wars I don't know what it is but Jesus
it's terrible hate it I mean like yeah yesterday my parents and my siblings all died in a horrific
plane crash but there are starving children in Africa somewhere and that's just man that
uh that just gets me thinking about that
uh remember when it was okay to like different things remember oh fuck off
oh even jay got up so can jay calm down you fly off the handle so much you need to
chill the fuck out okay he's just expressing that once upon a time he used to be able to
not like and like stuff and nowadays no you get people making extreme responses where they're
like your emotions are evil imagine all of the Nickelback fans who watch the sinister music
remember when you're allowed to like and just
so manipulative
all this need is which again is it is it the dude gedelp is the I didn't want to make this video
this is not you know and then he needs a dog just to be on his lap while he has a vlog
yes dogs improve vlogs this is a law of youtube
so entitled that you think you can like and dislike different things
jay tell him his emotions are wrong do it day
what if i told you you could you you you are allowed to like and dislike whatever for any
reason well didn't i thought we established like not any reason doesn't mean it isn't stupid we
established it ages ago john adams they wrote it into law you can like the last jedi we were very
specific about this it's part of the constitution you can't be not allowed to make fun of video games
or as mauler would say the constituean he needs to coach him
were there any more rules added to that list uh i think it's just the two right you're allowed
to like uh like amendments oh amendments to the third rule should be extra electoral
among that's not a rule it doesn't make sense that our list as it stands makes a lot of sense jay
you can't just take the sense away rule one you're allowed to like the last jedi rule two
you may not make fun of video games rule three electoral among i think it has a nice ring to it
anyway i i do feel for this guy i've found that if you like or dislike stuff there are people who
just don't let you they like they do that spell casting thing where you wake up and that emotion
is gone you know whenever i whenever i hear people say stuff like this i just don't fucking
have any sympathy for you because we're the ones who get called nazis and misogynists because we
didn't like the fucking ryan johnson movie you're the one who's saying his opinions are wrong so
you know you're the big guy you're the electoral among it's true he has that opinion that opinion
can be stupid though well let's see let's see how it goes shall we remember when movies were
something to bond over instead of something to fight over web remember when movies were something
to bond over why does he show episode four obi-wan talking to luke then it cuts to the jedi temple
and then it is now we're back here on tatsooine with obi-wan talking to luke it's relevant to the
point that we used to bond over movies we used to bond over the jedi council up there in that tower
talking about the droid attack on the wookiees i'm gonna i'm gonna do an emoji version of crying face
okay see that that's that's that's talent right there using the keyboard to simulate tears instead
of coming up with a full-on like you know emoji of tears that's what we had to do back in the day
when we didn't have emojis just saying guys just saying sure back there's never been a moment in
cinematic history where debates and dialogue over certain pieces of cinema weren't being held but
at least they felt genuine i wonder how old this person is just out of like to get their perspective
on how long they've been around i'm just curious as long as i've been on the internet like this
shit has always gone in maybe you just haven't delved into it until the star wars stuff but man
like where have you been i just wonder if i could make a reverse video where i'm like people used
to be genuine when they said they they they uh loved and hated stuff and discussed it nowadays
no one's allowed to discuss anything everyone has to just accept that everybody's positions of what
they are play some sinister music you know civil and controlled nowadays you could take
what does it mean to have a controlled conversation by the way is there like a third party it's like
hey no swearing it's a conversation you have in china oh not right now i weren't being held but
at least they felt genuine civil and controlled nowadays you could take the first twitter thread
of an even semi-polarizing film and compared to a 2009 call of duty lobby you'd probably find more
similarities than differences oh so this goes back probably yeah i was gonna say doesn't that be the
lobby so you just destroyed your own argument good job buddy this is what this is what reading well
that's different because the 2009 quad lobby was filled with non-humans those those i think
i think the orphans they were famously filled with children oh my god because twitter that's
that's bereft of children adults only
you know what it wouldn't make a fucking difference twitter would still be just as
cancerous if there was no children on there anyway it's tragic especially from my perspective as a
filmmaker and someone who enjoys watching movies it saddens me to see that almost 100 of the
humanity of the dialogue about the film especially in regards to the people in the production of the
film is simply cast out what the hell man humanity is cast out so um there are still
plenty of directors and writers working today that engage with the criticism and feel that
it is very productive so you know what he means when's like someone when he says that like people
have lost their their humanity it's been cast out what he means is once someone called me a retard
on twitter someone called me a disnoid i can't take it i snuggled up with my buzz light your
pillow you don't have to keep talking to people if they're like an asshole you can just go and
find someone else to talk to you how can you know myself they are preventing me from experiencing
my emotions jay they've always been assholes no like he said these are people who didn't learn
how to control their emotions as children like they should have been doing and so here they are
an adult unable to do that and this is what we get i mean i feel like we're already a minute in
but the word is melodrama right like that that's just like wow you need to chill bud i think
sometimes we get so caught up in what the art means to us that we forget the people involved
killing obi wanted him to talk about weeping cast out is this fucking a piano music in the background
i've been struck down by twitter trolls
who could have known that twitter was such a toxic shithole
oh the ui the ui fucked me up oh i told you it happens i told you it wasn't my fault
i know i know it wasn't your fault that's what i'm saying electrolymon
i think we get so caught up in what art means to us that we forget the people involved such a like
oh no and on heart that's oh we don't forget them we just like them the tragedy so you can't say
anything bad about the film because it might hurt people's feelings is what i think you know
when patrick williams put out that uh fuck you jj i think i think this guy would have been like
patrick it's a children's movie about space wizards art creator
do you love how that quote will hold him until he fucking leaves i fucking love it i fucking love it
it's such a now you know how we feel you fuck
but jj ever's actually did wrong you're like
what he actually said he meant by it because you can straw man him even though it's actually what he
said and what he's he's not even even with the best faith interpretation he's clarified it you
can't claim that he believes that because he doesn't well he says he doesn't at the very
least he's updated what he believes uh-huh so caught up in art means to us that we forget the
people involved this can be viewed as a blessing and a curse for one it lets you why did you cut
to luke using the force when you said a curse a curse being stuck in a swamp with a creepy
word of all the visuals you could have chosen us that we forget the people involved this can
be viewed as a blessing and a curse for one it lets you know that the art is doing its job
the filmmakers have succeeded in establishing a relevant emotional connection to and between the
story and connection meanwhile his or his disconnect oh wait this is star wars defined
oh this is star wars defined oh gosh we're tackling a star wars defined oh the stream has
come full circle yeah i completely fucking forgot that's what this because it's at the end of the
fucking yeah we're we did it that was all intended 100 also there's not even a lot to
commentate on this i'm just reveling in the again melodrama it's just mushy gushy drama while
film is personal to me after it in this playlist oh no job the filmmakers have succeeded in
establishing a relevant emotional connection to and between the story and the characters portrayed
on screen who have a significant impact on us as viewers to the point that we care about the things
that happen man why would we have investment in any character feels like only there was something
that we could use to find out why it has been true for all of time that people crave why bother
making that i don't know this is all very strange it was like a second long edit that fades in and
out like why bother do you challenge that proposition jay well not for all of time
was he there i don't think that's what you're gonna go with hey man the first like people we
evolved from even they were like hey do you want to do you want to hear a story before that
the they were like uki-buki utaka-waka and during the did the singularity claim claim
crave story yes sorry my brain is melting yes because i guess this guy thinks that
because he said relevant emotional connection or whatever so when i'm watching uh when i'm watching
uh what's her name uh rose tiko uh sexually assault fin by kissing him without his consent
as the laser blows up the rebels behind them and i'm laughing my ass off because of how terrible
it shot like that means that seems bad right because it wasn't a relevant emotional no i'm
sure that's what ryan johnson was going for hundred percent all right so the people within
are sometimes fictional and the narrative is also fictional because it is people who write
and film and direct and produce these stories the characters are fundamentally human each person
yeah the characters are fundamentally human because people make the characters in the work
hey man he's a person too no what about c3po make the fictional character they're human so there's
some they're they're they're in human the characters yeah like the fact that a human is
writing them means they are human people yeah they're like they're human um okay that's a really
strange um bitterly ways giving i'm more curious to get to rise a skywalker honestly weirds narrative
construct is the result of each creative individual's personal life experiences loves losses hopes
reminds me of a hyped up films video yes yeah yeah it's just also feelsy wheelsy artsy fartsy
drama walla you know like he's just he's explaining how he feels
oh wait what is this also talking about characters backstories i'm aware i may get some comments
asking why i didn't start talking explicitly about truss until eight minutes the reason why
oh god it's only a 15-minute video the reason why is i felt necessary to preface my feelings
about truss with my feelings about the previous films to establish relevant contexts okay
yeah i mean so far he's established that there's people behind these projects and that we should
maybe not be as much of a dick to them i think i i think it's i think it's weird that the film
requires you to spend more than half of your video trying to set up a relevant and necessary
context yeah i understand that i understand like when you need to like for videos that i've done
longer than the actual movie yeah so there's like a bit of like my steven universe video for example
i had to set up like the actual things that the um the episode i was talking about destroyed and
that took about as long as talking about how the but you're talking about episodes you're talking
about like scenes and data and information in context this is just like this is priming people
emotionally to accept yeah so you're like what you did is different it depends what it depends what
he's i i mean the video is already bad i bet half a bag of blue buffalo that this dude is trying to
prime you emotionally so that you will accept with less questioning the things that he is going to
say about the actual film we already know he's going to be appealing heavily to the emotional
journeys it's going to be whether or not it makes any sense but i'm okay with that let's just see
let's see how it goes all blended lines of this pre-existent storyline remember those guys this
is a beautiful thing it's part of what makes art what are these cuts by definition editing this
editing is painful through its fundamental expression art is an extension of the human
spirit within our attention of the human spirit is he cutting every time he says a new word
it's a syllable it's a syllable is that what he's doing no it's not a syllable i swear
i've just let's not actually roll it back by definition within the confines of this
pre-existent storyline for the film this is a beautiful thing it's part of what makes oh
we're like every three it's like every three or four words it's definitely on the gap between
words that he can't very erratic and there doesn't seem to be a lot of relevance between
the here the resolution is also changing regularly yeah but like look how blotchy ray's looking
color it's art art by definition and through its fundamental expression art is an extension
of the human spirit within us we have that is by by definition let's let's art what's the definition
of art art is the shittiest definition because it's like fucking anything um art is a diverse
range of human activities in creating visual auditory or performing artifact okay so that
means that if an elephant puts a paintbrush onto a canvas and draws it's not art because it's not a
diverse range of human activities it's so fucking bigoted wikipedia it's so it's so fucking well no
what if you program a robot to do it a sapient that was either your intention it was either your
intention it's like smart enough to figure out art for itself by the way a sapient made the art
like if you if you like if you program uh if you like draw something digitally and then you print
it the printer didn't make the art what about a sunrise why are you trying to take that away from
the printer what about a sunrise fucking hate printers what about a fucking sunrise jay is a
sunrise not an art no no i no i think jay's right summarizes three arts for instance uh the grand
canyon is not art but a photograph of the grand canyon these are here eggs what if it turned out
we find out a time traveler comes with us and he's like i actually went really far back and chiseled
out the grand canyon myself personally because i thought it would be really cool as a piece like
an art project would you say then what i say i i would say i don't believe you
and look if this person if he told me that and i said i don't believe him and he was like shocked
that i didn't believe this insane claim of his not only of the time travel but of the canyon chiseling
then i would be that he's a fucking retard for thinking i'm going to take him at his word i
would be like did you like a hand chisel thing or like a machine and he's like no by hand i'm like
wow what if he was like no it wasn't time travel i'm just really old
waking on it for a really long time as soon as people started walking around i was like oh
shit no no he's just going to chisel that and he's still going he's like no i'm done
desire to i finished just now to change to tell our perception of what the world means
and how it can be influenced by story the end goal of say the fuck the piano music
i know i i'm kind of just thinking about just anything yeah like i'm just waiting for him to
make some points i know this is a trap i know this is a feels trap and he's trying to get his
caught into it before he talks about the film go back to the evil people who don't let you have
feelings do it i want to get that did all the ominous music it's like
we're like oh no of any artist is to influence feelings ask legitimately any film director
screenwriter or cinematographer and i doubt a single one would tell you the epic core of what
they were doing it is for money is this just trailer footage yeah we've gotten to the trailer
he said i doubt any of the cinematographers do it for money it's like there's probably a whole
bunch of them that are doing it for that yeah he said no one would tell you that they were doing
it for money which surely there would be people who'd say that maybe i saw yeah
to get into and it is by virtually the sheer passion of the person who wants to make it in
the business that they do each film no matter how poorly executed contains a part of the person who
made it uh what do you mean poorly executed then you know what i was gonna say the same thing about
ouschwit there's a little bit of the german spirit but concentration camp i feel the fact
that he just said no matter how poorly executed is like wait so there is a conversation to be had
about how bad the thing is whether or not you know yeah by saying by saying poorly executed
uh you've already fallen into our our trap ha ha ha keep speaking tangle yourself further in our
web of objectivity maybe it depends on where he's going with this so in critiquing this medium of
art i think we need to be more cautious in the way in which we talk about it okay this brings
me to something that's been on my mind since the last jedi i want to preface this by admitting
something that may come as a surprise i like the last jedi oh what a surprise dude i'm shocked
it's like i can't imagine it's like an aa meeting though it's like yeah i like the last my name is
john i like the last i like oh no john i can't imagine that that a video that supposedly has
eight minutes of feelsy wheelsy mumble jumbo artsy fartsy stuff is a guy who likes the last jedi i
couldn't have imagined as soon as he said i'm not allowed to have my feelings anymore i'm like this
guy likes the last jedi so you know when you when you meet someone you're like oh this guy
it was that but for this guy likes the last jedi i'm picturing like he stands up and says that
and they're all like i don't know in the in the meeting then someone guys who's like i like tros
and they're all like oh and these videos are ruining the piano for me yeah leave the piano
alone what'd it do yeah what did fucking frand shubert ever do to you i also like the rise of
skywalker oh no a lot the reason i believe this is important to mention is because the vast majority
of discussions revolving the rise of skywalker are predicated revolving the rise of sky involving
wait did he say revolving around is what we wanted to say right yeah he didn't have the around i
don't think see i also like the rise of skywalker a lot the reason i believe this is important to
mention is because the vast majority of discussions revolving the rise of skywalker oh yeah revolving
i also i do want to say in the spirit of you have the right to like the last jedi what john
adams was saying is you do have the right to like the rise of skywalker too i i think that was involved
in that statement yes principle was very very clear like i know there's a lot of interpretation
about like amendments and everything and i i just i think that that was what john adams was trying
to say that's my that's what i think i think what he meant is that if you can like the last jedi
you can like anything i think the real i think the fact that he specifically didn't mention
the rise of skywalker is a statement on its own well see that's your interpretation john adams
did not mention a lot of films he he mentioned that before the rise of skywalker came out that's
true that's very true fuck and jay he didn't mention anything about space balls being boring
did he so yeah he just said you said you're not allowed to like space ball yeah how come
fucking unconstitutional how come you hate america because it's shit this is the difference between
the left and the right these days interpreting statements like you're allowed to like the last
jedi somehow means space balls is boring i don't i don't see how those are connected
yeah they didn't say black women could vote either but here we are here we are
the last jedi is more entertaining than space balls oh my god chat have your way with them
i disav somebody needs somebody to hit you upside your five
sad onion noises there's more mental stimulation for me in the last jedi edit oh like at least
it's funny yeah we've got lots of kick jay just pouring in like at least at least with the last
jedi i can be like this is a mess that it's funny so you'd be at the aa meeting as well you're like
i don't really like it but it's mentally engaging they're all like it's okay buddy you
have a sit down it's like it's like watching a like a house burn down
you know that's uh that shows your sociopathy jay
he's like hearing screaming and he's like this is pretty entertaining i guess
i
dedicated on the dissonance between fans of the last jedi and people who like the rise of skywalker
this leads most statements to be biased in one way or the other instead of taking a well howdy
duty we don't like either of them standalone look when granting that both films had cinematic value
to offer instead of pitting the two films against each other i think it would be more valuable to
look at them in congruence with each other you can they put themselves looking yeah they hate each
other they hate each other these films are like the two little rock and sock them robots constantly
i would i would rather say they're bitch slapping it's like no throw the lightsaber no hold the
lightsaber it's respectful no it was she saved the fleet no it was one in a million no
oh if ryan johnson makes episode 10 he's totally gonna be like i want to see that he's gonna be
like yeah ray woke up and it was all a dream well you'll be like fin made the mistake of thinking
it was one in a million but it's not actually it's actually one and one it's actually very
straightforward he's just an idiot he's like it's a million it's a million in one it has a million
million effectiveness you have to do it a million times to fuck it up and even then you can't
because you just drive into the other ship you're really really over it seen for the dialogue he
just does all of the truss shit ghost luke shows up with the lightsaber just drops it onto the
floor he's like it's okay to do this okay it's okay lightsabers don't mean anything
and extrapolate the meaning of the parallels and differences that way okay
wait i i didn't have time to read that oh so this is the intro right sorry oh wow
star wars holds a special place in our hearts before we get into the analysis of the sagas
finale i want to take a short second to say thank you to all of those of you who are subscribed
it means so no problem we truly do appreciate and love every 790 oh my god an intellectual approach
to film oh wow i lead the intellectual gaming community total did this fucking painting the
bottom of his desk and come while he typed that out god damn it so smart intellectual you can't
use the word intellectual he misspelled intellectual is that a high school
oh yeah
it's a lack of soul
oh
oh no there's not a good look oh no it's still there by the way but still there now it's a lack
of soul
oh no buddy okay all right okay i think this video is fun already
it's
electrolamide this just they just need to have a baby oh my god oh my god he has a video called
the unseen beauty of amazing spider-man 2 and the thumbnail says it's actually really good
the unseen beauty
what oh my goodness i am defending Disney's the hidden themes of Disney star wars
into the cutel man that's into the cutel oh my goodness i'm i'm tweeting that out
adora tipping are you on my dude
oh my goodness my throat hurts captain marvel capturing humanity a video essay
it's the opposite of what i mean capturing humanity oh fucking add it to the list
the scrolls capture humans in that film that's what it means oh my god when i checked the
spelling of intellectual i was like i thought it would be like a funny little meme if he
spelled it wrong but then i was like wait wait intellect cute oh it was you know this is this
you can't make this up it was bad enough that it exists correctly right because you don't you
don't refer to yourself as the intellectual approach i think i pretty much have that in my
about page as a meme like it's it's the i'm i'm fresh on rotten tomatoes is the other thing it
says like moly moly he has an he has an analysis of interstellar
you mean an analysis i mean he probably he probably proves that the film is very good
analysis uh it's see so this is what mine says all right let me just post you guys i actually have
intellectual in there i gotta change that to an interlocutal now oh yeah
customized channel sorry guys you have to wait a sec i need to do this it's important
i've got i've got something uh i've got something in the meantime look at this thumbnail
interlocutal
how almost killed the film industry it's fun communism oh
i'm curious what he'd have to say about that analytical list and
he has an original short film he does he this guy is just high top films but less but the same
less known i mean high top high tops never referred to himself as the
delacutal approach to film at least no but like i see i like it's the kind of thing he'd do
maybe maybe yeah get all high top but i mean this guy's on his way there he can he can
look at his icon it's a it's a film projector the letter t the little i don't know what it's called
that thing that you slap and say action or cut what is that called help me out chat i don't
actually know what that's called i feel like glibb would know that's what that's called
uh what what do you call the snappy closed thingy and the director
cut it is called a slate or a clapper board i got that i got it yeah i i feel like that's
reasonable enough to have got it yeah yeah it's a clapper board so yeah um uh so he's got a film
projector thingy the letter t a clapper board and of course a big fucking brain
dude this is so funny like i want to tell friends about it oh i have this saved on my computer why
the mandalorian is genius that was him i didn't know why the mandalorian was well so fucking
genius he forgets he has a fucking spaceship how dare you right so um he thinks that a quiet
place is bad well that's he's not wrong i just you got a brain for your icon you refer to yourself
as an intellectual approach and you misspell it this would be you know when veering very close
people be like you sure this is imperative it's like pretty sure it's just like it's like
no one nobody who calls themselves even spelling aside an intellectual approach to film is self
aware zero percent of them are unless they're doing it ironic well it's the thing i was gonna
say it was in my about page like but it was there was only one person who ever took it seriously
with the i rated fresh on rotten tomatoes part oh yeah let's see is about into the videos every
saturday okay over analyzer you don't have to over analyzer videos are five to yeah five to
15 minutes that's an okay amount of analysis wait wait wait jay what's his oldest video what
was the release date uh december 24 2018 so can we reasonably assume that it's been spelled
interlocutile for uh i don't know we can't really know we don't know how long it's been there yeah
i just want to assume it's been there for two years i didn't notice and nobody in his chat nobody told
yeah nobody told him do you think do you think they'll be upset at us like you've ruined it
just because he can't spell intellectual doesn't mean he isn't one
exactly okay are we are we good to carry on though with with the intellect
cute approach but it's a fun game you could play at home think of it think of an uh adjective
that describes you that you can't spell oh my god what of all the fucking wisdom is spelled
dude like intellectual is like the worst yeah the most ironic uh anyway let's uh let's kick on
18 of you and if you aren't subscribed i ask you to consider joining
it's like a cute little approach
something i found interesting intellect i like it's a little cutal i like it's a little cutal
sounds that scientific himself has come out and admitted to the public that there was no bad blood
between him and your right yes because he's going to publicly admit this bad blood between
two people who are currently working with lucas film that's something people do
yeah as to whether these statements are 100% true or not is up for debate but i think the principle
underlying this presupposition is that jj and ryan are both fantastic filmmakers
how did you conclude that from the statement that there's no bad blood like like yeah they like it
they're like they probably get along they're both fantastic like i don't know i don't i don't think
either of them are fantastic i think i don't want to devalue the word fantastic like my puns
are fantastic jj abrams is not fantastic director i feel like what right we've disagreed about
stuff in the past right no there's no bad blood between us we're both we're both amazing now
yeah i mean it makes sense you're both there yeah we're both we're both i would say the fact
that there's you've announced there's no bad blood between you two means you're very pretty
much the greatest youtubers is that not i'm filming because not just youtubers yeah because
technically yeah yeah all right yeah i agree and and yeah intellectuals as well yes
interlocutal jay so what someone said what if it's an inside joke this is like oh man
yeah we are on the outside yeah we are not on the inside of that whatever places other than efap
don't have inside jokes nobody has an inside joke so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter we've
already gotten our last we've already won take those away i had them and i enjoyed them we'll
know if he changes it let's put it that way i wonder i enjoy both of their work there's no
fucking way people are going to comment about that now i've already seen i've already seen three
be nice to him people yeah very nice someone i saw someone in the comments was like damn you're
so fucking stupid like don't do that yeah don't it's it's an honest mistake it's just a hilarious
one okay someone said jj directed mission impossible fallout it's like i thought it was
christopher mcquarrie no he didn't direct that he i think he directed the third one yeah yes the
third one is his and uh they consider that the revival of the mission impossible series because
after two it sort of went away for a while jj revived series is except ones that he kills
they both understand the value of the art of film and respect the humanity behind the canvas
of the screen i respect the humanity behind the canvas of the screen
mean words
yes respect the humanity of the dog find it very hard to believe that they would purposely take
uh what did he say they respect the humanity behind the canvas yeah yeah behind the canvas
of the screen the painting of the past i'm riding the future they respect the humanity behind the
canvas of the screen yes oh boy yes take this beloved franchise and let personal vendettas about
story choices end up destroying the childhood of millions i don't care about people's challenges
never about the i don't fucking care i just i do not fucking care about your childhood well this
it's like why do you think people would even say it anyway it's like probably because you
ruined the past movie and then they have that whole argument you're still making that video
right j about is it possible to ruin older stuff uh i will make it probably effectively
other my priorities list because that's a different hello greedo video he uh he concludes it's not
possible to destroy old stuff i mean it doesn't destroy the memories but now when i think about
those memories i know that tainted by the fucking cold hard facts of the present i would say it's
the process of almost personal canon right if you can ignore the sequels when you watch the ot or
you can accept that you actually enjoyed parts of the sequels and you're trying to take it all as a
big story and so you're like oh man emperor falling down that hole he's gonna flow away to a body
backup body on some planet yeah i can't fucking weird yeah i can't believe that our heroes made
the galaxy a far worse place there are like several quotes by the way of george lucas saying
that the atakin did kill the emperor like in several different interviews it's just like rip
no he didn't well yeah it like it wasn't no one even asked him are you sure like because we're
like yeah he exploded twice after he fell down the electro chasm and blew up and got vaporized
like there was no question of course he's dead if that's not dead what is well no i'll tell you
what's dead it's when you get vaporized by ray with two light sabers two light sabers yeah
not just the one yeah i guess so one and you go ugly too vaporized
it's a two-step process it's a natural thing makes sense so if you're ugly does that mean you're
silent obviously except for saying power i'm limited you wait an anomaly though and i'm not
gonna lie to you and say that i enjoyed every bit of it but i'm also not going to tell you that
people aren't being pathetic little twitter weasels and turning a good story into a bad wine
we just took a turn oh yeah there seems to be this misunderstanding that we turned it
yeah we didn't turn it bad weasels are turning oh into a wine fest okay yeah that was you know
how was that there was a guy showing you his collection of like dolls or something and then
there's just this one with a knife in it and blood all over it you're like oh i think what
he needs to understand is that we're not insulting the story hang on hang on hang on i have a clip i
huh i have a clip i'd like to play what did you do what just happened did you just read
it like different things remember when movie j did you just fuck up no i i played the clip
on purpose of him saying remember he's yeah jay's making a point that he's kind of contradicting
this opening yeah um hang on but what you failed to understand jay is that he's talking about people
who ruin stories my whining on the twitter no that that that like moment for me is like oh
okay you've just given it's all subjective cards you can't use that anymore we spoke of this in
old efap lore the idea that someone would like riser skywalker so much that they hate last jedi
people you know like oh yeah we were like oh imagine all the possibilities we were picturing
like you know people who love the last jedi and hate riser skywalker and then i i think we said
what about the reverse like this this guy is pissed at last jedi fans ripping into tros not
even people like us we're just we're just people who hate everything right oh i'm sure he i'm sure
he hates us by you know he hates us too probably yeah unspoken like of course he hates us but yeah
well it of course it's low quality i mean it's look at the film it's from
oh you're trying to say tfa is bad what the fuck it was safe i kind of am but it was safe also i
feel like the story was actually good no amount of whining could make it bad no that's how it works
the more people whine the more bad it is i digress after seeing each of the new star wars films at
least four times like the piano is still going with star wars music in the background you know
he's got the strings accompanying but it's i'm not crazy right the star wars music add the piano
into a bad wine fest i digress after seeing each of the new star wars film yeah
that's not working stop it yeah they're they're not quite matching up that's not very until it
keeps looking at least four times i finally found what i believe is the missing piece to this oh
jesus did you just say he watched it four times each of me he said he watched each of him at least
oh no that's more than i hate everything oh my god hold up we don't even know if we
maybe this guy was bored oh shit okay sorry let's let it play if he's bored or not perspective oh no
perspective oh my god uh the weirds on the screen guys the weirds on the screen
an impact that's impact right oh i get it impact get it because it's impactful the wine fest
i digress after seeing each of the new star wars films at least four times i finally found what i
believe also if you're gonna just this is just a tip for all you cool cats out there um if you're
making a video and you're trying to get people really you're really trying to tug on the heart
strings and be a manipulative sack of shit then and you've got the piano music playing in the star
wars strings softly in the back and you're trying to make like funny memes and text on the visual
part i kind of clash a bit also you're talking over all of this stuff is it maybe maybe chillax
um yeah dude he's upset okay like people have been shitting on the movie that means a lot
to him personally so he's upset let him be upset that seems your feelings that just seems like a
failing on his part well no he he's okay people like you though the ones who like ruin movies
by ripping into them fun no you're the you're you're bad he's good though he's let him have
your feelings he can't handle my feelings to this puzzle perspective that perspective all right let
me set the stage for a second all right you're four you're five minutes in what do you mean to
let you set the stage remember it's eight minutes third of the way done eight minutes is once the
stage is set okay we've been doing opening the front doors yeah jesus christ you can't get the
stage in the room if you haven't got the doors open first jeez hey where are all the at 80s and
stuff we're all familiar with the hero's journey bill bobaggon's had it harry potter had it luke
skywalker you're ruining all of these amazing stories that harry potter had a journey oh god
look at that graphic now this story is trying to tell ray's hero's journey i can read it so well
starts us off very simply and beautifully a good story doesn't have to start out complex
why are you talking about he's like ray's great it rays a great hero's journey because she starts
out he but like he's preempting the argument that no ray sucks because she's simplistic
it's like who even says this it's not that like she's simply too good to be true yeah but he's
like not all stories have to be complex it's like better than everybody around her in basically
every way ray's is simple it's elegant and it works can you tell us don't tell us why you
assert it but explain it yeah i mean we can't do anything with that one the mystery of her past
is established maybe his point is based on this assumption and it's not what the video is okay
if you if this isn't the point i'll let it slide i guess yeah i'm sure but have to start yeah i
don't know what to go on without complex ray's is simple it's elegant and it works elegant
he thinks it's elegant he thinks it's elegant he's gonna explain it grumble grumble
that's insane the mystery of her his inelegant past is established disaster strikes and she
goes on her mission we know from the start that this is ray's story her mentor is han solo
oh if anything she is his mentor yeah she teaches him how to fix this falcon do you remember the
part where he's like something's wrong then she points to a thing it goes compressor i
passed a compressor because i'm so fucking better than you at everything the only thing
she learns from him well she doesn't he gives her a gun i don't yeah
he would have just forced her way into any solution that she needed and you know what's
funny this is like a double flaw so at first you might be like there's no reason why she would see
him as a father figure because he doesn't do anything for her in any significant way in the
short time that together and someone might be like you can't just say that that's what's going
on between them they're just you know the acquaintances who who can bond over you know
the circumstances you don't just say that that it's like no it's explicit kylo literally reads
her mind and says you think that he's like your father i hate that she has some fucking
she has some daddy issues that's kind of what i mean about um it's like a universal confirmation
it's it's even worse than ray saying he's like a father to me because you might be like she's just
sort of expressing herself poorly it's like no he plucked that out of her thoughts her her genuine
core because she plucks out of his that he's trying to live up to darth vader remember it's
just like what oh darth vader's a way better daddy than hong solo than this
new face for her and an old friend for us by the end she's answered an awakening had her
call to action met her mentor fought her villain and what do you mean met him mentor you don't want
luke he's gone now because he's dead why did luke tell her except well that's the thing he doesn't
have relevant visuals they're confusing visuals so i don't know what he's referring to when he
says met her mentor like no that's kylo ren if he's referring to hod he's dead if you're referring
to luke she held a thing in front of him i guess it's like how how is your mentor he tickled her
finger you already said hod was her mentor so i think it's but no dear daddy what but like he's
that would be wrong like i'm not almost in defense of tlj it's like luke is more of a mentor to ray
than hon is surely even if if luke taught her something insanely tiny it would still be
something more yeah which he did remember he was like the jedi and the sith they're all stupid
it's like oh all right the false doesn't belong to the jedi that's a vanity that you'd think such
a thing it's like yeah that's all great can we go save the universe luke how about that how about
that sisters and mortal peril like nah it's fine by the end she's answered in a way someone in
a twitter thread is posting the entirety of the um anakin obi-wan fight in gifts
in substance there's two people replying to each other with the next gift in the sequence
and they've got from they've started at um i will do what i must you will try and now that they've
got all the way to uh anakin screaming no this is wow okay what that's uh they missed out a couple
of parts along the way but like they've they've why why why not it's important
all right then had her call to action met her mentor fought her villain and returned to her
somewhat normal way of life it's a return to her normal way of life no she goes to an island in
the middle of an ocean she usually lives on a desert how do you how do you compare those at all
relatively simple story that's under the tattooing or i say back to oh by the end of the three
felt again his visuals do not help his points at all i don't know what he's talking about
i think he's talking about tfa alone i think i think he is right yeah right right
it's all right i do not know if somewhat normal by the end she's answered an awakening had her
the end she's answered an awakening had her call to action met her mentor fought her villain and
returned to her he said i had her call to action and her call to action was bumping into harm and
fin my mentor this is about force awakens only in fact these visuals hurt me somewhat normal
way of life it's a relative he had somewhat normal way of life and the first portion was
the earth cracking in two while she was fighting with kylo the second was her hugging layer which
is like who doesn't never met her before and the third is chewy being upset that heart is dead
what are these visuals not at all what you're talking about don't you understand that they're
from the film oh shit i totally missed that the simple story that's undeniably reminiscent of
a new hope but as i explained in our defending disney star wars video these stories are inherently
cyclical the force awakening they're not inherently cyclical what does that even mean
totally arbitrary inherently cyclical like that it's not inherently cyclical you chose to do
the things that you did yeah like i would just like name me a part that's inherently cyclical
and whatever he names would be like okay so what if that didn't happen yeah what if something else
happened instead like oh oh well i wonder about those black dots on the back there where you plug
in usb because they're all droids the play button the port's got a pause so that actually might work
because they had to use a big old plug in cord to transmit a tiny multiple kilobyte message
so i guess that yeah this is maybe that's how they eat yeah
this is a re-introduction to our beloved galaxy far far away and a simple story the last jedi
however is where things start to become a little more editing complex okay we think that because
from the beginning the story is told from rey's perspective that this film is about her journey
it's not how is it from rey's perspective can be far out but like she wasn't on canto bite
and well he's about to explain it's luke's journey that he'll be like is there also fins
and roses and pose also raise exactly hold on hold on straight i hate that video essay trope as
well though where it's like it's not what it actually is it's not actually the scenes that
are playing the piano so emotional oh god joker isn't actually about the joker
it's about robert deniro's looks like we're on the same page with that one yeah it's
mari's film really if you think about it rey already had the mentor and the only reason she's
driving taxes he said rey already had the mentors he honestly referring to han he didn't mentor rey at
all he offered her a job yeah yeah hey you want to do you remember he gives it the gun she like
holds it up and aims it and he's like do you know how to use that thing then she's like yes he's
like oh no he does he does give her advice in that part he's like it's a little more complicated
than that that's the one he does give it that's like hey you want to do a bunch you want to do a
bunch of busy work more than literally nothing that's not even useless like so that's like
you gotta it's more complicated than shooting people which he proves wrong like a scene later
when she just shoots everyone to death use the force idiot oh i'm sorry you don't even know star
wars yes star wars did you know he thought that snoke died and 337 bby damn you fucking
dorks i'm gonna look i'm gonna look at the chat that you sent me and see if i got that number right
that's what i say every time i go 370 bby shut up bb this luke skywalker is because he's
literally a legend he's not literally a legend he's alive and he exists not literally a legend
he actually did all the things he's uh what is what is what is the standard definition for legend
exactly let me let me get the a traditional story sometimes popularly regarded as historical
but not authenticated oh so he's not a legend and his story isn't a legend because it's shocking that
the entire galaxy isn't covered with statues of the man pretty much speaking of which um
legend i suppose the second definition applies an extremely famous or notorious person 85 let me
double check i think it's 19 fucking legend that's why he is 1986 yeah legend from 1980s no it's 1985
yeah he is fucking i love that legend backing up chat ray already had the mentor and the only
reason she is pursuing this luke skywalk because he's oh the fuck was that i knocked my mic over
wow jay trying to kill chat damn like we can survive such attacks but they might not like
terrible awesome it's good i'm i'm happy i'm sorry it hurt actually it fell on me
it's a good picture of ray though it is literally a legend no this story is about the hero's journey
of luke skywalk this i think oh
what a visual to choose this is the hero's journey he's trying to murder a child
everybody's got this stressed face it's like sweat coming down like this is the hero's oh
were that crazed looking this is it boys this is it hey man people make mistakes okay you're like
yeah i think there's a word for this villain we should go with that instead of hero that's just a
homicidal psychopath who listens to the voices in his head i don't know joseph campbell's homicidal
psychopath's journey i just i feel like i'm getting maryland manson vibes you know
ladies and gentlemen the hero's journey in one simple visual i think we need to come to terms
with the fact that it is okay to see our hero's fault yes that is the only issue that is at hand
people need to accept that heroes can fail yeah this is definitely yeah i said fall not fail idiot
fuck you file i interpreted his statement jason how dare you that's not my real name say my real
name okay jamie jay hello that's my steam handle okay jace
un no no i said that one already he said un hmm it's okay to see the pedestal we place our idols
on shattered to the ground it's okay we need the big hero not not good anymore it's okay
i wonder what luke that was the fuck doing well was this all this was happening you remember he
was he was sleeping under the rubble and kylo didn't check oh okay did it even feel the force
or anything no i didn't know he should be strong yeah so isn't isn't it in their extended tisms
that uh palpatine did all of this and it wasn't kylo or something like that yeah this is all
palpatine remember this is all palpatine and he chose not not to execute the unconscious luke's
like okay hmm that could have saved some time and effort and things a little bit a little bit
and because it makes them human just like us oh my god i'm gonna roll out this argument dude it
reminded me of the time i tried to kill what's the thing man any like you know you don't turn up
something on time and you kind of like screw up some kind of scheduled thing and massacring
children they're both failures yeah you know and a hero can fail a hero failing is kind of what
makes him like us like attacking a sleeping family member don't you guys do you guys empathize
do you guys kind of see yourselves there you know what i mean no so strange how strange i guess i'm
just because you've had your hero's journey doesn't mean that you can't fall back into old mindsets
caused by your own failures just because you're one thing doesn't mean you can't also be another
thing you're like okay all right thanks dad that's the thing on one hand you're like um
yeah you can be two things at once uh on the other hand it's like wait you can't be a thing
and be not that thing too like you can't yeah you can't be some you can't be something in
that it's contradiction so what the hell is a character at this point if you can just
it's like he's old like oh he's old people change their old he's also young he's young
compared to the old of the universe yes the story of the last can you believe we're about to
be reaching the part where he's going to be saying how tro s is good like whoa because we've heard
these ones about tlj before yeah like this is this is this is well traveled pathways for fucking
defabs like yeah yeah people get old and change yeah heroes can fail yeah yeah we know just because
it left us in the shoes of ray while telling a different character story in this scenario
the roles are reversed ray believes she is being mentored when in reality she is mentoring luke
well at least she got that part right ray ray is way smarter than luke because luke's a fucking
retard but it takes ray to teach him what for thank goodness ray told luke that she she can
save kylo yeah thank goodness i can't imagine luke trying to save someone that everyone else
thought is lost yeah i just can't if there's one character who's gonna do it it would be judge
jar jobings that would be the one i'm so disappointed jar jar didn't appear in the
sequels just for like a cameo it would have been fine certainly would have bumped up a point on my
scale like he's he's got a villa somewhere on nabu or he's returned home in retirement
just living out his like he's in the scene where all of the um all of the ships arrive at the
final battle flying he's in some kind of nabu ship he's in a pod racer he's in one of those old
um nabu fighters the anakin flu yeah that could work i i prefer rags a suggestion i think then
reminding him of the innocence of the force and slowly teaching him that hope exists
the innocence of the force see the fucking ui fucked up again but i'll still say the thing
i paused it for which is that i went jar jar to being his pod racer and he does the thing
like an independence day where the guy flies up into the opening of the mothership just to give
it a pod racer and that's how he dies by destroying the mothership of the first the final order fleet
and saving the day and then instead of all the statues to loop that should be everywhere around
the galaxy it's the statues of jar jar beings i would accept that also where were we oh i don't
know the ui for this is terrible because like six feet away from other people something like here
took her to go back to his own road not this far oh my god giving over vital lore rose journey
doesn't mean that you can't fall back into old mindsets caused by your own failure the piano
really helps me take this very seriously how about you guys are you talking about shmee
shmee's the best character besides geaja i guess shmee would also be you know she'd also be at
a pod racer turning up in the she's a wise woman why the wind the story of the last jedi
seems confused because it left us in the shoes of Rey while telling a different character's
story.
In this scenario, the roles are reversed. Rey believes she is being mentored when in
reality she is mentoring Luke, reminding him of the innocence of the Force.
It's like a lot of work to do is like, this is the tough part is tough. It's the time
consuming part. Yeah. Like doing all of this is kind of the innocence of the Force. Is
that what he's saying? I don't think we should go that route because Kylo like fucking mascot
of village in TFA. He's a monstrous murdering psychopath. He deserves to be. But he wants
sexy time with race. So it's okay. He's obvious. Well, in that case, he should plead insanity.
We teaching him that hope exists. Hope exists. How profound hope exists. Oh God. This is
absolutely not implying that Rey didn't have her own very important journey because
she did. While on the island, a massive story point from the first film is absolutely shattered
before our eyes. Which is is it a massive story point or was it actually resolved and
we could have gone forward. Yeah, we didn't have to fucking care about it at all. We could
have resolved it. Oh, sorry. I mean, it was done in TFA. It was done. They could have
left it there. And that would have been perfectly fine. But they just exactly. But it's like
a new director just made his own movie. And I mean, that's the three films. It's it doesn't
matter who your parents are because they're not coming back. Second film is they were
no one. And third film is Naya's Palpatine. It's like three different fucking theses theses.
If you want to go that way, like what can a character learn from having their parents
be no one, quote unquote, being people who don't care about them or being a villain.
They're like three different stories. All of them end with the same message. It actually
doesn't. Yeah, no, all of all of like you are who you are. Fuck the parents. Like, okay,
I get it. I get it. Fucking get it. I guess while it's somewhat relevant, somebody tagged
me in this court and they said Jar Jar's fate in Disney's cannon is a quote. Because of
his role in abetting the rise of the empire, Binks was once again exiled by his people.
After the Battle of Endor and the rise of the New Republic, he performed in the streets
as a clown with children, but not so much with their parents. Wow. What? They made him
a street clown. Who's hated by the people of Numboo? Like fuck Disney, man. I would
have turned him into a bounty hunter. Let me double check this just to be sure Jar Jar
Binks. I would have turned him into a porn star. And I would have our two different
Jar Jar's meetup in a comic or something. Bounty Jar Jar in porn star Jar Jar. What
if porn star Jar Jar is bounty Jar Jar's bounty? That's yeah. And then as he's delivering
him some of the beauties of love. Yeah. Bounty Jar Jar will fall in love with porn star Jar
Jar. By the time of the Battle of Jakku, Binks was a street performer in the capital city
of Theed where he was scorned by adults, but beloved by the children who came to watch
his aunt. Why do I feel like that? Why does that make me unhappy? I don't care about Jar
Jar. Because it's Disney and they just can't resist. Um, I'm trying to. After some time
after the fall of the empire, some individuals wrongly believed that Binks and Darth Vader
were the same person. Binks was remembered. Um, Binks was remembered after the Galactic
Civil War's Battle of Endor. And he was mentioned by a member of the Wills as someone to be
remembered in galactic history. Uh, uh, I just. Why does Disney hate Star Wars? Why?
Why does Disney just hate Star Wars and all of the things that it's just why? It's the
forever question. What, what fresh hell is this? The Jar Jar Binks bug. It is what it
is. That's very wise. You must be wise beyond your years. I mean, I can't take credit for
it. I learned it from a philosophies. What are your years? Three? 17 maybe. Which is
your year? Which one is yours? Uh, yeah, three. I'll go with three. Fine. Okay. That's
a pretty shit one, but you can have it. Electromon and intellect. I'm guessing these are in the
Pokemon universe at this point. They'd have to be. What Jar Jar Binks? No, Electrolomon.
What are Jar Jar's moves? Intellect. I'm guessing they're both electric, but Intellect
usual is probably like dark electric. And like, is he black? Electrolomon is, uh, I want
to say ground electric. I don't know. Jay, you love Pokemon answer. I don't like Pokemon.
I don't just dislike Pokemon. I mean, geez, don't need to be so a bit about it, Jay. Alright.
Electric steel. That could work, yeah. What is that from Zoolander? Dark psychic because
of the brain. That's true. Dark Psyduck. Sunny Psyduck. That's kind of fucked up that
you'd say that. I know. What are you gonna do about it? I'm gonna, I'm gonna keep playing
the video because it's intellectual. Ray is told or finds out that she is led to believe
that she is a nobody. It shatters her perception of what the value of the force actually means.
Isn't it just shattering her perception of what it means to have an identity? Not about
the force at all. What's the force got to do with it? Maybe he'll explain. She is well
forced to change her perspective and shift her actions and motivations because of it.
Heck, even Luke Hecking Skywalker. Luke Hecking Skywalker. Surely that was a joke. Surely.
No. Okay. I don't, I don't think it was. It was self-aware cringe. We don't know what else
to forget. Hecking Skywalker. Skywalker in this movie becomes a nobody. Suffering from
the impact of his failure has reduced his own self. He can't be a nobody. That's not
possible in this universe. He is a Palpatine. And he will say he's a Skywalker. By definition,
not a nobody in this universe. They are some of the most. Insanely, first off, oddly connected
coincidentally, but insanely important people in terms of galactic history and lineage. Yeah,
like if they're, if Skywalkers and Palpatines are nobody, then who's somebody? Be curious to find
out. Oh, of course, John. She's down to virtually identifying as a failed nobody. Okay. Seeing Ray,
who he knows as a Palpatine, and she believing herself that she is a nobody. And despite that,
still rising and fighting for the force strikes something. This feels like the whole tangled
Christmas tree lights. And he's trying to lay them out after the three films have come out to
be like, no, it does make sense. I swear. And it's like, no, no, it doesn't. And like he stretches
it out and then there's like loads of wires that aren't connected, loads of bulbs that are broken.
He's just like, but no, they're meant to be broken. Yeah. It's a, that's the theme. It's
complete and it's incompleteness. That's an H bomber guy quote right there. Enjoy.
Doesn't, doesn't he like Alexi brain? What video was that from? His defensive doxels too,
which makes a lot of sense. Doesn't it? There's like, there's one contradictory quote that he
actually just, no, it is. It's from the fallout three, one where he's like, you have too much
freedom and not enough choices or some shit. And it's like, he justifies it quite well.
Mm hmm. It's climaxes in the end when Luke rises from the ravine of his own self pity to being who
we all know and love. Okay. Master Luke Skywalker, but he doesn't even do that. No, he's not really
there. So he projected. He may as well have a fucking VR console at his stupid Island.
Yeah. So, so courageous to waddle over there and astral project. So epic and emotional and
perfectly written because it forces them. Oh, it's perfectly written. Damn. Perfectly.
Skywalker to go back to his own roots. Because if you remember, he was essentially a nobody in a
new home. What are you, the way he dies is the same way he began really living, looking to the
horizon and knowing gets a rise of Skywalker already. I'm so tired of this. The binary sunset.
Look, look, it's the binary sunset. Look, a visual. It's like this other visual. Luke Skywalker
wore clothes in a new hope. He did this again in the last jet. Unfortunately. Yeah. Or where
you've come from, you make yourself a hero. The Last Jedi is so far from being a perfect movie,
but what it is is a good Star Wars story. Which leads us to the elephant. Sounds like meaningless
disms to me, but I'll let you. All right, let's keep going. Exactly the kind of thing high top films
would say. It's a good movie, but not a good Spider-Man movie. In the room. Oh, no. Viva double jump.
The rise of. Skywalker is only so. Red. Get get ready, lads. We've gotten to the point of the video.
Right. We're only over halfway through. And now we've gotten to why I love the rise of Skywalker.
This is a response to us because we are part of everybody. Oh, shit. How much divided backlash
and simultaneous loving combined with weeks and weeks and weeks of Twitter wars. The rise weeks
of Twitter wars. Why are you even mentioning this Twitter massacre? I mean, like, man, this film is
people discuss the film on a social network. Oh, ass is bad mouthing it. Like, I don't know.
I'm in these. Stop. Sad, sad of Skywalker. Goodness gracious. This movie caused quite a
chaos. I mean, let's be honest here. It's hard to be excited for something when everybody around
you is telling you to hate it. Why can't we just. I'm sorry. Can you get me a quote of someone saying
you should hate this? I mean, I'm sure there are quotes of that. Come on. No, I actually don't
believe you can find a quote of someone before this film came out saying, hey, whoever this is
until you tell. Go and hate this. It'd be like, oh, that is a bizarre statement. Okay.
Yeah. And that's how you know when someone's insecure about how they know they like a trash
movie. It's like I can't see someone like you should hate should hate this. Like I can see
someone like, oh, you should hate like. I mean, it depends on what he means. Like if someone is
saying if you like the last Jedi, then you should hate the rise of Skywalker. That's different than
saying you should hate the rise of Skywalker. Yeah, like I just I'd be very curious to know
what the fuck they're trying to tell you by today. Like even even didn't we do our dude,
not diligence, just fairness. We were like, hey, could be good. And people will be like,
is it really likely? It's like, I don't think it's that likely, but it could be good.
Yeah. And we're the people who are the most miserable, cynical, toxic shells of men to
exist on the internet. So yeah, I mean, we were, we said constantly, I don't think it's going to be
good, but I hope it is. You didn't catch us going, you should eat this. Look at the lights. What kind
of Machiavellian retarded evil motherfucker out there is like this film before it's even released.
You should hate it. And it's what you should do.
I mean, I think all you'll ever find is people saying it's bad because and then they don't
reason it very well. That's probably the most hyperbolic shit you'll find. Not people being
like, I hate it because it needs to be hated. That's true. Just like weird. There were so many
like videos about how Captain Marvel was going to be the worst thing.
Oh, shit. Yeah, I just said you should hate the rise. Okay. Wait, I said, no, saying it now,
I could get, but before it's released, we've tainted the same with the group, the samples.
I just think the data, I just think the before it came out to find that statement would have been
tough. And if you did find it, it probably would be fucking non, like someone to ignore the context
that I said. And correct me if I'm wrong, but he made it sound like that's what everyone was
saying, backlash and simultaneous loving combined with weeks and weeks and weeks of Twitter Wars,
the rise of Skywalker. Goodness gracious, this movie caused quite the chaos. I mean,
let's be honest here. It's hard to be excited for something when everybody around you is telling
you to hate it. There you go. When everyone around you is telling you to hate it. It's like what?
No, so I, I guess I'm sorry that you have this, this, this, I guess this emotional flaw or this
immature aspect to yourself where you can't enjoy things because other people say it's worse than
that. He perceives everyone is saying to him, he's not allowed to like it. You could be like,
Hey dude, how are you doing? And he's like, why do you tell me to hate rise of Skywalker? And you're
like, what? No, I don't know. I just, I mean, did you ever explore why they might have said that
without, why would he explore childish Twitter Wars weeks? Poor, poor soul. He just wanted to
enjoy his little star Wars and look, people like you rags on Twitter, putting out tweets saying,
Hey, hate it. Yeah. Hey, did you grow on the hate tree? I grew on the hate tree. And then
I played the hate piano. Oh, I rode that. It was the fucking hate. Oh my God. The only thing
the piano, the hate piano loves is more hate. Check that shit out.
I love the neck extension.
That is a concerned longman. Look at Greedo. He's got one button on and one off.
That's how Mr. Burns stands. I like it. I like it too.
Why can't we just sit back and realize this is a movie, a piece of art and this piece of art affects
us. But what a ruffle is here. He can't deal that people hate on this film. He likes,
it's so sad. It's kind of sad. The end of the day, it's a story about
fiction. That's what all the preamble was. It was like, stop hating. There are people who make this
piano. He made eight minutes of just don't hate on it. Can you believe that? Like, that's all.
You're being mean to art stuff. The canvas of people.
I can be non-hyperbolic and claim people have said I've killed art. How great is that to be?
General characters. When you have something as vast as the Star Wars franchise built up to a
final climax like the rise of Skywalker. We already had our final climax. Thank you very much.
It was in episode six. I thought the final climax was in episode three.
I was just waiting for the video essays of episode 12 to be like, we finally got our
final climax in the Skywalker saga. Yeah, there it is. That's the new final climax.
I can fully see and understand where the dichotomy lies and that's all well and fair.
But to go to the extent to say that it is morally apprehensible to enjoy a film.
Who says this? How long did you scour the depth of the internet to find one YouTube
comment that said this ironically, to make a joke and you took it seriously?
Did he say morally reprehensible? Yeah,
yeah. Does he know what these words mean? I don't know. I'm curious how he spelled it in his script.
Sorry, what was it morally reprehensible to just like the film? Is that what it is?
And where the dichotomy lies and that's all well and fair. But to go to the extent to say that it
is morally apprehensible to me. Oh, apprehensible. He said morally apprehensible. Hang on a minute.
What's this? That's right.
Morally apprehensible. That's not right at all. I don't think.
Is apprehensible a weird? I don't think that apprehensive means
anxious or fearful that something bad or insensitive has to happen.
Morally anxious. It is morally anxious.
That's not a sentence.
Capable of being understood or perceived. Morally incapable of being.
It doesn't know. You're giving him too much credit. Apprehensible isn't a word as far as I know.
Reprehensible. He meant reprehensible.
Yeah, but there's a dictionary that.
Oh, okay. So on Merriam-Webster says apprehensible is capable of being apprehended.
Yeah, so it's not even.
To be arrested. You're morally arrestable.
What the hell?
He definitely meant reprehensible.
Yeah, you could be arrested with bad morals.
The rest of them.
This is the intellect cuteness of the channel.
Christ Jesus, like just the other one more time.
Stand where the dichotomy lies and that's all well and fair. But to go to the extent
to say that it is morally apprehensible to enjoy a film is absurd to me.
Yeah, it is absurd. Who the fuck is telling you this?
You know, yeah, I agree with that. That's correct.
Yeah.
God damn it. Redraft your fucking videos, people.
I love Star Wars. And while I've disliked some, I've never not been excited to experience
another bit of this world that has captivated my imagination since I could even remember.
I was excited for my standards and I feel sorry for you.
Yeah, man. Get out there and find some shit.
I am so sorry. Star Wars. This new Star Wars is one of the most.
What is the I'm trying to I'm trying to think of the anti world building kind of like a word.
It's those devoid of life. Well, destroy, create.
I mean, in the sense, yeah, like JJ fucking blows up six planets.
But I'm trying to think of it's I almost the rise. What it such put it really well.
He said that the sequels in this sense and the Star Wars sequels were like the world is like a
video game and the characters and everything's loading around them.
But anything the character is not interacting with is just it doesn't exist.
I think I think I made that point when my TFA videos because I remember
I put things in black and white to signify like everything else is on pause whenever
characters aren't in it. Also, the world doesn't feel alive.
Some people are asking to acknowledge the the one that weekend where I posted,
which is the capable of being understood or perceived.
The reason why we assume it's definitely not that is because you wouldn't say
you are morally capable of being understood for liking stuff.
What? Yeah, just he he meant reprehensible.
It's fine. And you know what we didn't even look because I know what to use it for.
But what what is the dictionary definition of reprehensible deserving sensual condemnation?
Yeah, it's definitely what he meant. It's like people who say specific instead of specific.
Yeah, the ocean. Which one? The specific one.
Yes. Yeah. But which one specifically specifically the Pacific one?
The terrific eyes of Skywalker. I saw it on opening night and I kind of loved it. Oh,
that's fine. That's right. There was filled with the simultaneous dislikes and clicks off this.
No, no, no, no, no, no. We're we're we're far past that.
I'll tell you what informs my immediate is that I'm expecting a torrent of awful arguments.
That's probably to do with the fact that I've been doing this for a while now,
that you're kind of like sort of wasting our time because you're not really saying much of
substance. It's all just I'm not. I'm not even taking issue with that specifically.
I just know what's to come. He's going to be like the emotional journey. The characters go on
and Star Wars. It's like a white noise because it's just it's the arguments you can make for
basically everything. And I'm not disappointed. I'm just surprised and disappointed.
Video. But for those of you who decided to stay, let me tell you my perspective.
Let me tell you my perspective. That seems like it. Let me tell you my perspective.
Wait, what was the first fucking nine minutes for?
Remember, no, he was telling us about perspective. Now he's telling you his perspective.
We're narrowing it down. We're getting closer.
Shouldn't it be like, let me share my perspective. Let me tell you my perspective. Seems a bit clunky.
It's fine. Why is it in red? Why is it in red? Makes me uncomfortable.
Let me tell you my perspective.
Like, oh, man, scary perspective. First of all, I tend to be more of a forgiving filmgoer.
That's not a good start in explaining why you love to film. What I guess I mean by that is like,
yeah, you want to tell us what's so good about it? You open with it's OK for shit to be bad.
I like basically anything. But all right, we'll keep at it. Let's keep going.
The plot element that's only point in existence is to speed things along. And the only time I get
really frustrated is when the film can't even stand the weight of its own two feet.
But I simply don't have the emotional capacity to devote any memorable amount of time critiquing
stuff like that. So when I see a two hour long video essay spent critiquing, I wonder who's
referring to. Oh, he hasn't really. Also, he hasn't really started to talk about Rise of
Skywalker yet. Like he already had an he had he had a preamble and there's an intro to after his
preamble. It's like, get on with it. Really? I really have a video essay boogie man on a
fucking guy who makes two out of it. You're beginning to be more referenced than the actual
fucking Star Wars friend. It's never because you're it's never because you're wrong. It's
because, oh, he doesn't understand this one thing about the stuff that some feels, he wheels,
he thingy weeny something or other. I mean, they're like, no, he just long man badded me.
Well, he did mention its length. Like this meme has got so much power because it keeps
getting reminded. Like everybody's like, oh, long man bad. Right. Yeah. OK. Yeah.
And then and then they do the thing where they're like, I'm not going to watch it.
You're like, oh, OK.
How long is well, wait, how long is the Rise of Skywalker is a movie?
Two hours, 10 minutes. Something like that.
It is. Oh, wait. Yeah, I was short of this time. I was not as long as the film.
High five, everyone. So what's what's the fucking excuse for him watching the movie?
I think it'll just be if it's almost as long as the film, you failed.
So, yeah, it is two hours and 22 minutes.
Minus 20 yards for the end zones, of course.
Forty of the first 45 minutes of the film, I shake my head and I move along.
To me, the fast paced MacGuffin filled beginning of the movie was awesome.
The MacGuffin filled was awesome. OK. All right.
What?
Low standards.
Is he about to justify it?
Fast paced MacGuffin. OK.
He said it was awesome. Let's see what he says.
We jumped straight into the action and watches the chemistry of these characters evolve and
change and build upon each other. The story further reveals itself.
What do you mean?
One is to pretend that Rise of Skywalker was the only name one have something like this.
You can't you name a single one, please.
He won't be able to explain Rags.
He's got what? Six minutes before the video.
And then half of them named the attempt.
I'm going to say shit.
It was great. I love the first part.
It was fast paced and MacGuffin filled.
The characters are so well changing and developing.
Sure. Moving. Move along.
Sorry, dude. Trust me.
Oh, is chat not moving?
It's it looks it's moving for me.
On the street on the screen.
The on screen chat window is frozen.
What is happening?
I mean, as long as the stream is alive, that's the important part.
It is. All right. Good.
I'm watching it.
It's really moving in realtism.
All right. Let's just see if I can give it the old reset.
Uh, you check.
How long has it been like this?
Yeah.
Check. Has anyone in check got COVID-19?
Jack, where did Jay touch you?
On the weed pain.
Invalid parameters.
How do you as a pretend?
Oh, is it is that not moving still?
Oh, it's gone.
No, it hasn't.
Jay stop being so melodramatic like this.
Valid parameters.
Invalid parameters.
Oh, we got endgame on screen.
I didn't even. All right.
Why not?
I don't want us to pretend that Rise of Skywalker was the only film to have something like this.
Endgame had a large majority of its runtime devoted to the infinity stone heist.
I have no problem considering that it did what it was.
So yeah, so given he so he's like, there's lots of McGuffin stuff.
People didn't like that.
But hey, endgame did it.
The actions of collecting things isn't inherently bad.
That's why we were waiting for it to be like, oh, so why was it okay?
And in Rise of Skywalker is like, well, because it's okay at endgame.
It's like, first of all, it's not.
Basically, all of the details are completely different.
It's fine.
But it's not funny.
That was like, first of all, it doesn't matter if it was good at one thing,
make it doesn't make it good at this.
And secondly, endgame's fucking heist was dumb.
There's loads of shit that doesn't make any sense about it.
Can you guys think of any time they could have gone back to
that would have meant they'd get all the stones?
Can you think of any time?
Wednesday.
About when all of them were about to stop Thanos.
That'd probably be a pretty good time to go back to you because you could stop.
About when Thanos is about to put on the last gem,
they could all go back to them and Thor could chop his head off.
However, when Thanos was about to put on the last Jedi.
And they go back in time to when Thor didn't kill Thanos and then kill him.
The other four just helped him.
He pushes the accident further.
He's like, come on, buddy, we can do this.
They're just it's just chops his head off real quick or chops his arm off.
And then he's like, oh, hey, I'm you from the future.
I'm here to save the day.
Don't worry about it.
I got to head out.
Oh, no, the entire plot has just been fucked by a single thought.
I'm very sure we mentioned that on our initial stream system.
I felt about it.
If they'd said, oh, we could go back to when Thanos had nearly all the stones
and one of them had said, no, we don't want to deal with Thanos.
It's too risky.
How do you felt about it if they addressed it?
I would disagree because all you need to do is get it when Thor attacks him
because you'd be completely distracted.
In fact, he's almost killed.
Just have import about, you know, five seconds before as Thor is throwing
the accident is teleport to that because they can do specific time and specific place.
Yeah, there was a good window where Thor was there with them,
but he wasn't dead and he snapped his fingers.
Yeah, I'm saying I'm saying as Thor is throwing that accident
because you got plenty of time to work with that.
Yeah, there's plenty of time, especially if you know these events
in advance.
Besides, you can any of windows.
Yeah.
You could just go to that early, bury yourself under unless not even mention
mention the fact that they're like, remember, guys, we're limited
because we've already got sub him particles.
Like, go get more.
Yeah, go get more.
Yeah.
Endgame did it right.
Therefore, the rise of Skywalker is okay.
It's like this argument hurts.
Was trying to do with the differences that in Endgame,
the stones were an integral part of the story
that the film revolves around in what they meant.
However, in rise, the MacGuffins are a means to the stones man.
I still don't know.
So kind of working on that.
I'm sure it's in the visual novel or something.
Why is he highlighting this difference, though?
All the crons if Google Maps and the Death Star Goonies key aren't problems
because of the fact that we don't spend too much time on them.
It keeps the mythologies available while using their purpose to further the plot.
We want these scenes to go fast so we can get to the meat of what
the story is trying to tell us.
You didn't have to have that stuff, though.
If your issue is we can cut it out fast because it's so useless.
Like, why have it anyway?
Why did you put it in the film?
Like, we have to get it.
If your scene is one of, oh, we just got to get this out of the way.
No, that means you've already fucked up.
It's the same as like Ray Chatterledger.
It's like, hey, get Ray Chatterledger now and you can skip levels.
Like, generally, if you're a good now, I've never made a film.
So salt application were necessary, of course.
However, I would imagine that good filmmaking is having every scene be meaningful and
important and worthwhile.
Not, oh, yeah, this is the shit we need to skip over really quick until we get to the good stuff.
Oh, Glib.
Glib keeps saying there's no editing.
There is editing.
Um, he puts like different visuals when he decides that are necessary.
The reason why it's so trippy when he just puts the trailer on loop or whatever
is because when he cuts back to it or it'll just be completely out of sync with what he's saying.
But sometimes the editing is purposeful.
So it's just like you're watching a mess.
You're just like, ah, yeah, but even the trailer footage, some of it just doesn't
like he's clearly fucked around with it in some places where you'll have an instant screen.
And then he's fucked around with it.
Go ahead and chat a YouTuber.
I liked promoted Raid Shadow Legends.
What should I do?
Well, lucky for you, it's free.
It is free.
Was it Jackson?
It's in the top three mobile games of all time.
I think maybe was it internet historian?
Was it me?
Cozinal variety.
I did it too.
Everybody fucking did it.
If apps hold it out, we're not doing it.
Though I think Moop is going to be doing it.
Yeah, if things go pear shaped and we gotta I mean,
that's when you know, it's over for Efap when we open with saying
Raid Shadow Legends.
Everyone's like, oh, no, before we introduce our guest.
Oh, Jesus.
Raid Shadow Legends.
I'd like to introduce our sponsor, Raid Shadow Legends.
It's like a guy who's in here with the icon.
Raid Shadow Legends.
Raid Shadow Legends is a guest on the next Efap.
You might as well.
I like minimize all of our icons to fit like a third of the thing at
the bottom of the rest of it is just Raid Shadow Legends icon.
Like the episode is sponsored by it.
Playing over and over and over.
Like half the video is just ad space.
That's what we do.
That's when you know that we've reached the big time, guys.
It's okay to have a high intensity beginning with a MacGuffin
setter plot line if the MacGuffins don't carry the plot.
After all.
MacGuffins don't carry the plot.
They have to.
I'm sorry.
What kind of logic is that?
Like it's okay to have them if it doesn't carry the plot.
Why?
Why wouldn't it be okay the other way around?
Isn't but the way you cut that makes it look funny.
Good old Ray.
Of this, we have a second to breathe.
And this is the moment our perspective completely changes on everything.
Showing a lot of this, actually.
I gotta be careful.
When did this come out?
Do you not have access to non-shit quality?
I think this is the pirate one.
This is January 21st.
I feel like my my clips were clearer than his.
I don't know.
Maybe because like all of his clips seem to be reduced in resolution.
And it it really doesn't help that it's the full screen.
I don't know.
Oh, he's not going to explain it.
He's not going to explain anything.
He's not even going to explain it.
I love that edit.
We're all expecting something and it just goes piano music.
No, Chewie!
The entire new trilogy has been predicated on this brilliant story that
being a nobody doesn't exclude you from the powers of the force.
Nobody had that position anyway.
Being a nobody.
No one ever thought that you could only be a force user if you were from a certain lineage.
Nobody thought this.
That was part of the, dare I say it, the magic of Star Wars.
The Last Jedi is a straw man.
Yeah.
Then how could you, JJ Abrams, how could you take this beautiful message,
rip it out from underneath us and toss it into the fire?
All right.
Let's take a second.
What if Rey being a Palpatine is secretly the most brilliant reveal we could have ever imagined?
No, he didn't actually undo it.
He just accented the opposite.
He just said, what if the Palpatine reveal was the most brilliant reveal he could ever have imagined?
Let's, let's, let's, all right.
I can imagine a better one right now.
What if Rey being a Palpatine is secretly the most brilliant reveal we could have ever imagined?
The greatest stories are told when the very foundation of
what makes a character who they are is shook.
Okay.
Here's the thing.
Like, if I think that if it was me and Rey's position, then I learned, yo,
your grandfather was Palpatine.
I'd be like, oh, that's, I'm still me.
Like, I don't, that's not the reflection on my character.
I think the film would argue that's what it says by the end.
Yes, I am.
I'm still like, I'm, nothing's changed about me.
You'll never live up to him.
Good.
Oh, poor metal.
He said, remember how I have a video that's heavily edited, being super careful for copyright,
but this one is fine.
Sorry.
I knew I was still talking about it, but the more I see of it, the agri I get.
Welcome to the world of YouTubing.
Well, this guy was careful.
I mean, chops up every fucking scene every two seconds.
Yeah, it's all flippity-floppity.
It's a lot of work.
Mal, you wish you could edit like this guy.
You wish.
You know, uh, you know, in the Phantom toll booth, there is, um, there's like a demon or
guy, he's got no face and he's sort of like the, the quote unquote, the demon of menial,
useless tasks.
That's like, this is like the video editing version of that where you just video edit
for no purpose and you just do it.
You, you just, well, he's, he was mentioning Ray and we can see Ray.
What's the problem?
I think that's just coincidental.
I think that's an accident.
I think he just happens.
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of people.
That's true.
Yeah.
They could be talking about Carl the cameraman at the bottom left and that would be more
impressive.
But I'm going to call it Carl.
In the force awakens, Ray's identity is tied to her lineage in a positive connotation.
They're coming back.
She means something.
No, literally.
No.
Maz Kanata says they're not coming back, not coming back.
And it doesn't matter who they were.
You have to look forward into unless around you now, unless he's about to say that.
As like, because that sounded like you saying that was force awakened as a whole.
It's, she's not.
It's kind of sad too, because that's actually a good message.
Yeah.
Move the fuck on.
You have the people who are around you now and the people that you will meet.
Those are what matter.
You can't be clinging on to the people of the past that you can't change.
They don't define you.
It's a good message.
And he bugs it up.
It's like, no, no, I think JJ also fucked it up by teasing how, how it seems like
Ray's parents leaving her behind seems like an important thing.
I think JJ covered that up also.
He shouldn't have put that in.
If that's what he was going to say.
Anyway, I want to know the story of Ray's parents and how the hell they aren't like
insanely powerful force users.
Is he naked with a big ass car?
Why?
I just had to say that he's just jogging.
He's just dragging around his big gun dick everywhere.
JJ, you understand, right?
It's like a 30 year 30 year.
It's porn star Jar Jar meeting bounty hunter.
Oh my God.
It is.
Yes.
I get it.
I get it.
Awesome.
He performed.
I thought it was going to be a reference to that image.
We saw Jar Jar with the massive.
I love how there's a bunch of hearts in chat that's unrelated to the picture.
And now I'm just going to pretend it's related.
Remember when we saw Jar Jar with the massive penis?
Yes, I do.
I was, I was sort of thinking it was a reference to that.
And I was like, what's that other?
I just like the hearts for Jar Jar.
That's all I'm saying.
Yes.
Hearts go out to Jar Jar.
Dicks out for Jar Jar.
In the last Jedi, that foundation is shaken when she is revealed to be an abandoned child
and nothing more.
And she builds her identity from the ground up.
She was already abandoned child.
Already that.
So he really did.
Now what the hell?
He really did get it wrong.
I want to replay that because the Mazz Kid author is explicit.
It says the complete opposite of what he's ever imagined.
The greatest stories are told when the very foundation of what makes a character who they
are is shook.
In The Force Awakens, Rey's identity is tied to her lineage in a positive connotation.
They're coming back.
She means something.
She's not a nobody.
In The Last Jedi, that foundation is shaken.
She's revealed to be an abandoned child and nothing more.
And she builds her identity from the ground up using the belief that a nobody like her
could wield this power.
An identity, dude.
This is not.
What identity?
What the fuck?
This is specifically what I mean.
When people are like, it's my opinion.
It's like, no, you've gotten stuff wrong.
Like you keep saying things that are not true.
This is not what happened.
When does she build up an identity?
No, exactly.
What exactly would your reference be?
It's like, you know what she's like.
She customizes her characters in Raid Shadow Legends.
She puts on a grey cloak.
Build an identity.
Foursake your lineage.
For free.
That being a nobody is okay.
For Rey to have the combination of all of this to reveal that she is a power between
is the worst possible news that any of us could have ever imagined.
No, my current no.
If you think that the worst possible news is that your grandfather was a bad man,
man, you I don't tell me about.
Dude, do not fucking tell me about perspective.
Don't do it.
I could picture.
Yeah, I could picture some weird things to tell a person.
Is like your your family has just died tragically in a.
Least I'm out of Palpatine.
Dead.
Like, well, at least my grandfather wasn't a bad man.
He was.
What's funny as well is if this was a quadrilogy, the decks will just be like,
turns out it's not Palpatine.
Her grandfather is actually her parents.
You're like, what?
It's just like another.
They're just like fuck.
I don't know.
We just want to keep changing it through a familial anomaly.
She is her own grand.
No, that would be her.
She's Luke's daughter.
Here's the mother.
Oh, you get to find out.
Oh, she goes on a search for the find out in episode 13.
Fuck it.
It's Leia.
She's I have your entire person.
That's why I don't on this notion that I don't need anything.
I'm I'm feeling very tired.
Flisms.
So I want to I want to hop away.
Wow.
All right.
Hop away.
Run away.
Yeah.
Run away.
I actually run away.
I'm absolutely convinced.
I probably do have Corona.
You're absolutely convinced.
You probably have it.
Yes, I'm convinced.
I probably well, someone in my house has it.
Someone in your house.
Yes.
Why aren't they in a hospital?
People have it.
Why aren't they in a hospital?
Is it not at risk?
What do you mean they're not at risk?
No, it's not.
It doesn't.
Most people don't die of it.
I know, but you could catch it.
You get a fee.
They have to be quarantined.
Yeah.
In the same house.
Everyone in the same house has to stay in quarantine.
He just wants to catch Corona.
So the chattel stop kicking them off.
The chattel.
You'll never be able to come back.
That's their dream.
All right.
I'm going to.
Don't die, I guess.
Yeah.
At least your grandfather wasn't a bad man.
Yeah, could be worse.
We can warrior.
We can warrior.
Don't trust him.
Yeah.
Don't trust him.
Do you want to mention the thing we do?
We have a podcast, I guess.
Yeah, we do.
We're going to hijack the eFap now.
Is this the R or is this something else?
This is R.
We have a podcast called R.
Is it A, G, H, H, H, H?
It's A, A, H, H, H.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
That's silly while I post it.
Okay.
We did a video called rule 34 slash coronavirus.
Fringy's also a member.
You guys know him.
Frigment site.
Yeah.
He's a jewelry obsession.
Yes.
Thank you.
You actually.
That's it.
You're not going to.
I thought that was like.
That's it.
I'm really, really fucking tired.
Oh, any excuse.
So he has a stupid podcast where they like,
edited up reacting to things and commenting on stuff.
It's awful.
If you like eFap, you'll probably hate it.
Check it out.
Yeah.
Thank you for your kind words.
It was it's it's full of self awake cringe.
All right.
That's my last word.
Goodbye.
Good night.
Bye.
Is he still here?
Bye.
Bye.
Don't don't.
Don't.
Don't.
No.
Yeah.
Don't.
Just don't.
Don't do the thing.
Don't.
Little bastard better not die.
Yeah, I know.
I'm gonna be really pissed off at him if he does.
Nobody kicks J.
This is one of the other beeb that kind of sums up our time today.
I'm sad yet.
Yeah, chat got their wish.
He has been kicked.
He said the link you put in chat leads to a 404 page you melon.
But all of us are reacting to it.
He could he could mean Milan.
Go to sleep, Jay.
You're tired.
You know, making sense.
You're slow.
Sick internet.
Just can't catch up with external source or parent to give you meaning only to find out
that the one thing that now gives you me also happens to be the most evil being in the known
galaxy.
It's kind of a relevant clip.
He did it.
He did a good job.
You got it.
Growing up.
Growing up.
And tell you so much in these past 12.
It works because it's the only way to have Ray's journey have a serious conflict, not
externally, but internally to the highest degree.
Wait, I like that he can really stop Ray.
The only way we can have an internal conflict for Ray is to define her lineage to be connected
to an evil person.
That's the only internal conflict we can have.
But like, that's insane.
Like, that's the only there's nothing else you could ever do.
I'd just be like, yeah, man, you talk about he talks about the spirit of creativity at
the beginning of this video that he's like, there's only one thing you can do with Ray,
really.
Oh, damn.
There's only one thing you could have done with this care in all of writing all of the
ideas across space and time.
There's only one thing you could have done.
How about this?
How about you have a villain that she is forced into position of needing to execute,
but it goes against her value of trying to not murder people, which we can't really do
actually, because she's already murdered a shit ton of people.
She has to choose between saving her friends or stopping the bad guy.
Yeah, what I was going to say is just your standard, can she bring herself to murder,
execute a captured person who is evil or something like that kind of story?
There's all kinds of ones you can do over and over because they're different per character
experience.
We can do we can do what they seem to think of doing, which is maybe she selfishly pursues
gaining more power and Poe and Finn call her out for it and she gets pissed at them or something
we could have we could do something there.
Yeah, she's already basically superwoman anyway.
You can have Finn actually develops to have Jedi powers or something and she I don't know
there's some kind of conflict there we could probably generate.
This is just those are things we can do.
And if he's going to be like, no, all of those are external.
It needs to be in her own head.
This this conflict.
I'd be like, okay, let's bring your parents back.
Let's have it so that they're actually alive and that Kylo lied and that we can do whatever
we want with them.
I could bring in some internal.
Well, it's an external source, but it would still provide an internal conflict.
This is like seconds of thoughts anyway.
It's like we could do all kinds of things.
It's fucking right off the top of our heads instantly live.
And he's like, nope, nothing they could have done.
He's like, well, you know, every time I've heard someone say that in one of these videos
have been wrong 100% of the time, I think it's no longer a war against evil.
It's a war against blood.
Her blood.
The fight with Palpatine is intimidating and incredibly powerful.
It's a bold faced lie to say that Palpatine was weak in this film.
He had the power to keep himself alive.
What do you mean he had the power to keep himself alive?
He got fucking eviscerated.
He's got that machine that keeps them alive.
Oh, that's his power, I guess.
But he got obliterated.
What do you mean?
He shocked himself because he's a fucking retard again.
Turn off, turn off the lightning.
Turn off the switch.
I'm telling you, man, the guy that killed Palpatine is my hero.
What a legend.
If influence people all around the galaxy, single handedly bring a fleet of thousands,
maybe millions of star destroyers back and suck the literal.
This guy accepts the fact that there could be millions.
Yeah, this is the thing he's not.
He's the Hello Greedo guy because he was saying you're not concerned with the details,
just the payoffs.
It's like thousands.
Doesn't matter how any of this happened.
It just matters what happened.
Which is funny.
Why not?
Because Hello Greedo was trying to cite Rise of Skywalker as being a film that you can't do that with.
But it seems like you can't enjoy it without doing that.
So hey, Hello Greedo, you should like this film.
Royal soul out of someone visually.
It may have looked like great if he did Palpatine easily.
But it did.
What do you mean?
He may have looked that way.
He just sort of did.
I mean, if anything, she just sort of helped him kill himself.
Apparently, he didn't possess her, I guess, because.
Fuck it.
I believe they actually had that line.
I am all the Sith.
It's like, oh, I am of the Jedi and Iron Man.
Why did why did never mind.
Fuck it.
This fight wasn't taking place with lightning and flashes.
It was the internal struggle of Ray confronting the very fiber of what makes her.
By breath.
The one person we haven't talked about in this journey yet is that of Kylo Ren.
Kylo Ren is the only character in the entire series to have their entire person.
And yet when he learns that all the voices that have been in his head for years have been
he's been tricked by somebody else, that he's just been lied to.
He's been deceived everything about what he's thought about his character and why he's doing
what he's been doing, all the terrible, horrible things that he's done to pursue this goal.
When he learns it's all a lie, nothing changes.
Nothing changes.
What what what incredible.
I don't even honestly do like best faith interpretation of the text.
He didn't even fucking understand what Palpatine was telling him.
Like, by the way, I faked Vader's voice and Kylo's like, uh-huh, uh-huh.
But he does it, but he does it.
He does fake Vader's voice.
That's what I mean is Kylo's like not picking up what Palpatine's putting down.
He's like, oh, wait, you mean you mean when I was talking to him in TFA?
Like, oh, always, like always.
Do you not see the fucking that of Snoke clones?
I got spares, motherfucker.
Either.
Well, this is the thing.
I'm sort of joking because like that's the only way you could even rationalize it
because Kylo just doesn't seem to be bothered by this information.
He's like, uh, okay.
By the way, we just mindlessly hate.
We're not concerned with these characters on an emotional level at all.
It's not like we're trying our best to understand what he could possibly be thinking
what he's told his whole world is upside down.
He's just like, hmm.
I just, Jojo Rabbit has a more interesting and well-developed arc than Kylo Rant.
Look, he's going to explain to us why Kylo's so good, okay?
Character in the entire series to have their entire personhood defined by the shadows of the past.
To him, being a somebody is what makes Kylo Rant worth anything.
The prodigy of Darth Vader.
For him to be the prodigy of Darth Vader.
I don't think that's, uh, it's not progeny.
Prodigy means fucking give me the goddamn.
Yeah, but prodigy doesn't make sense either.
It's like a genius, right?
So the definition of prodigy, uh, Albert Johnson, better known by his stage name,
prodigy was an American rapper, author, and entrepreneur who with havoc
was one half of the hip hop duo.
A young person with exceptional qualities or abilities,
but you, how do you be Darth Vader's prodigy?
That doesn't make sense.
He's like, you're kind of related, but that doesn't make sense either.
So I don't know.
Yeah.
Prodigy is a descendant.
So yeah, maybe that's what he might either way.
But like, he meant something.
He revealed that it was Palpatine all along is a blow to his core.
No, it's not.
No, it isn't.
Nothing changes.
He doesn't even like acknowledge.
No, he doesn't give a fuck lightsaber.
He doesn't even like phase him.
Not to mention the fact that nobody's told him that Darth Vader was a good guy this whole time.
Yeah.
Like, don't, don't you know that Darth Vader killed the guy that is apparently tricked you?
The guy you're talking to right now.
Darth Vader killed him.
Yeah.
This guy has convinced you he's Darth Vader when Darth Vader killed him.
You're not following any of this.
And he's like, no, because, because Kylo's confused.
That's how you define Kylo Ren.
I think the word he's searching for is protege.
But would that even was a free open source ontology editor and a knowledge.
He's like the student, right?
Guided and supported by an older, experienced individual.
I guess you could very, like, broadly say that that's potentially what's happening.
But we already know it's not.
He's Palpatine's prodigy, protege, if anything.
But I don't even think that counts.
I mean, that counts more because Snoke has been training him under Palpatine's puppeteering.
That's why he was so furious after being told.
Having Anakin Skywalker not appear to Kylo Ren is so.
Show me the scene.
What do you see?
Showing a scene of him being angry in a different movie.
Yeah, he's angry there because Snoke said he looks silly with his mask on.
So he fucks his mask up in the elevator.
Yeah, so.
So I'm gonna have to fix that, by the way.
Genius because it forces him to go through the same journey that Rey and.
Why is everybody ducking?
Even when Han Solo appeared to him, it wasn't a first dose.
It was a remnant of his own internal memory.
For Kylo Ren to have the strength to forge his own path is what makes this trilogy.
Man, kind of a dick move for Leia not to tell everyone to get off the bridge.
Yeah.
Kind of a fucking dick ass.
You know what?
Fuck you, Leia.
Leia, we're in trouble right now.
You should be telling people.
Actually, fuck you.
You know he's coming to blow you up and you're not saying,
guys, we need to get off the bridge.
Pronto.
Also highly aware of your shields not being focused to the front.
Which, by the way, what the fuck?
We're gonna make it so that we move faster at the cost of being vulnerable
and the rest of the ship while fighters are flying around us.
Like, good job.
It's almost April of 2020 and we're already finding new things in the last Jedi that are fuckups.
What is the thing?
We talked about how TROS is worse or whatever.
I was like, don't forget how bad TLJ is, guys.
Don't ever forget.
That's fucking stupid.
That was a new thing I just noticed.
That's a new thing I've never noticed.
She was distracted, Rags.
That's why she didn't say.
She was distracted.
But the good general doesn't let herself get distracted by talking to somebody
when the lives of all of her crew are in danger.
I like to PSA such point out that Kylo and Rey have fought before,
but it was this time that for some reason she managed to detect it and do something about it.
Leia, I mean.
Like, how many times have you not done anything about this?
It's different this time.
It's different this time.
But here she's frail and weak and CGI.
And she says that she.
Kylo Ren had to become what Rey believed.
As Luke said, some things are stronger than blood.
Kylo had to become what Rey believed.
Kylo had to become what Rey believed.
Let's roll that back because I'm lost.
It's because it forces him to go through the same journey that Rey and Luke went through before him,
even when Han Solo appeared.
Man, everyone on the bridge is retarded because they see the TIE fighters fly
past them and they know that they're not shielded.
Yeah, they should immediately be like shields up shields up.
It doesn't literally if we blow ourselves up
at the cost of being able to go slightly faster, it won't matter because we'll be dead.
Man, wow.
That's another new fucking while TLG was shit.
It really was, you know.
Oh, wow.
Here to him, it wasn't a force ghost.
It was a remnant of his own internal memory for Kylo Ren to have the strength to.
By the way, a remnant of your memory.
That's that's a memory.
Not just that, your own internal memory as opposed to someone else's external memory.
Well, yeah, if I like download my memories to USB and then I forget them.
But he clarifies your own memory.
Like, well, it's not going to be rags memory in my head.
What do you mean?
Why did you say it like that?
Stop it.
Oh, man, this has been a long day.
Fortune's own path is what makes this trilogy consistent.
Kylo Ren had to become what Ray believed.
As Luke said, some things are stronger than the path we forge is that of strength.
The Skywalker name through Ben and Luke's journey and even Anakin before him becomes
less a product of lineage and more a product of meaning.
The Skywalker name.
OK, what was Anakin's lineage and the what are you comparing Anakin's lineage to in the prequels?
Because he doesn't really have one.
Shmi, Shmi fucked a bartender in Mos Eisley, who's like Johnson Skywalker,
and he was really powerful with the force or something.
But he didn't.
But he doesn't.
That's not a person that's not lineage.
She Jesus and like this.
How does he compare these two things?
I don't know the questions I'd ask him.
And this has gotten very flowery, like I barely following anymore.
And we and we just had to let the thing go.
The whole Kylo had to become what Ray believed.
It was like, that's just fucking nonsense.
I don't even know where to go with that.
Means nothing unless you do something with it.
The unspoken romance between Kylo.
It's unspoken because there's not one.
Just you, man.
Just I have an unspoken love with my plumber because there's not one.
That's why we never talk about it.
I can't believe like we made fun of Major Lee for like detecting this.
It's like, oh, there's other people who do as well.
There's a whole fan base of them who are like, yup.
These two fucking each day, every day, all day.
What's happening?
I don't know if you missed it, but all those looks they give to each other.
That's romance.
It's like, oh, I don't know if these people know what like a relationship is.
Remember when when he killed Han.
That got a really hot.
I was like, oh, stab me with your big throbbing.
Stab me, daddy.
I'll just heal.
I'll just fucking force heal myself.
Oh, that's probably a fetish of the Jedi world at this point.
At least Disney canon world.
Stabbing each other and force healing each other like you're.
It's like it's like they interpret looks they give each other.
But like if you're asking me, honestly, what is happening in this scene?
I'd be like, I think it's Ray cutting Kylo off because Kylo failed, right?
Like he, instead of joining her to fight for the good tisms, he was like, nah,
I want to blow it all up, which is not what she wants.
And then he actually just commits to blowing up the resistance and they
managed to escape in time.
So she she closes the door on him, right?
She's like, fuck you, you piece of shit.
And he feels guilty as he holds the dice that apparently he knew meant a lot to Han's ex-girlfriend too.
He's not very good, just putting it out there.
But it doesn't mean that they have a romance, for fuck's sake.
Fucked up romance.
We're in Ray and they're being a forced diet is exemplary of the power that the sheer will.
Oh, what a sentence.
The forced diet is a an exemplary.
Oh, I got to hear that again.
Actually, this is probably the fat where I felt most like a teacher.
Not like that.
I think that I am teaching people stuff, but like marking, if you know what I mean?
Like we're just listening.
We're just like this, this cross cross.
This paper is now more red than white.
Yeah.
And I'm just I'm getting you're not going to put like I'm not angry.
I'm just disappointed.
The Walker name means nothing unless you do something with it.
The unspoken romance between Kylo and Ray and they're being a forced diet is exemplary of
the power that the sheer will has over your outcome.
They're drawn.
The fuck does that mean?
The fuck does that even mean?
Exemplary of the.
It's an example of the sheer will, how sheer will affects the outcome.
But what's what does he mean by that?
I don't know.
Like so they like through the sheer force, they're they basically had enough willpower
to become a dyad or that's not true either.
No, the dyad is just there for a block device.
Well, yeah, is that did they establish the force will create a power to rise against power?
You're like a balance or a tizzy shit.
Yeah.
Doesn't that just mean that someone's going to rise up to beat Ray?
No, it means it's not there.
It's like their will isn't even necessary for the diet thing to rise in the first place.
Right.
So I don't know what he's talking about.
Rags, remember the narrow video where he like tried to argue that this whole time
the two teams have been balanced in terms of light and dark.
And then he said, I'm going to ignore Palpatine right now because we don't know if it is like
no Palpatine was there the whole fucking time.
Yeah, yeah, that he made that stupid graph.
And we talk about talking about putting a thumb on the scale.
Yeah.
They're like, well, we can just ignore things.
Oh, that makes no Palpatine.
He kind of fucks with my whole scale.
By the way, I looked up Forest Dyad and the Force because you can't say Forest Dyad.
That's insensitive.
It is literally just these two.
That's it.
No, it was from sheer force of will.
The exemplary power was shown to be whatever he said.
That's why I mentioned in this film.
It's it's that's when it's first even mentioned in Star Wars.
They made the shit up.
What?
No way.
Yeah, this is yet.
This is it.
This is the first time it's mentioned.
No way.
I never would have thought that film.
Yeah, it's because I was thinking surely there were like, there's no way that no
two Jedi have ever had a connection to one another that was that strong as these two
fucking goober heads.
But apparently, these have been the only one only only these two make sense.
If you think about their sheer will being exemplary of the power.
I mean, think of all of the Jedi who have had like,
forbidden relationships because you know what's happened.
All the Jedi who love each other, like, completely and totally and fully.
And then there are in a, you know, elope and get married and they
die for each other or they are with each other for decades and decades.
No, these two people, the Ray and Kylo Ren, these two.
They're the ones, the first dyad in the force.
I'm disappointed that you'd suggest they would pull something out of their ass.
Like, can a dyad be created by a father-son connection?
How come Luke and Darth Vader weren't a dyad?
No, it's got to be light and dark, even though Kylo's light by the end, I guess.
I don't even know.
But they were a dyad before that when he was dark.
But they're also a dyad after it.
So, two goodies can become dyads.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
As if any of this is like...
I'm just like, I'm desperately attempting to try and see if they have a reference or
making sense of this, but the more you...
It makes sense to this guy and he's got a brain in his icon.
What do you got?
Don't tell me that tens and tens upon thousands of years of Jedi,
and this is the first dyad, these two fucking goober heads.
Remember, it was heavily referenced in the leaks, the dyad, but in the film,
it's mentioned, is it once or twice?
Because I think they tried to cut it because it's just fucking nonsense.
I think Kylo mentions it once and then after...
He even needed it.
Yeah, then Palpatine does the sucky sucky and he's like, oh, yeah, a dyad.
A dyad in the force, oh my god.
I know this is a thing.
I don't know how anyone knows this thing.
You two are literally the one of them.
And I can overpower you both, even though they're supposed to be the most powerful
thing we put together, whatever the fuck.
Yes.
I mean...
I love the dyad in the force, this huge special thing,
and it's nothing compared to Rey just having all the Jedi in her head, apparently.
You're two lightsabers.
Oh, yeah, sorry, two lightsabers.
Product of lineage and more a product of meaning.
The Skywalker name means nothing unless you do something with it.
The unspoken romance between Kylo...
No, no, no, here's the thing.
Like, a lineage is specifically a bloodline that you could measure with DNA.
Like, it's a thing that exists.
It doesn't have intrinsic meaning.
It's a thing that you could measure and track.
You could DNA test it, right?
So don't do this whole names only what you mean of it.
It's like, no, it's a physical thing.
No, because she called herself Skywalker at the end.
So it's not blood.
Yeah, she can call herself whatever, but...
Exactly, she can call herself Rey Biggs.
It doesn't fucking matter.
Laura and Rey, and they're being a force dyad,
is exemplary of the power that the sheer will has over your outcome.
That's what I mean.
What does that...
What do you mean the power sheer will has over your outcome?
What do you mean?
These two had so much willpower...
Who will was not met in this film?
She wanted Kylo to turn good guy.
He didn't.
Who will was for Luke to get off the fucking island
instead of VR-ing his way over there, but he still did.
I mean, Luke and Leia weren't a dyad?
I guess not, no.
I don't know what the requirements for a dyad are.
Again, that's the thing.
If you're going to pull this out of your ass,
this is where you have to take into account the past, right?
If you're telling me that tens of thousands of years
of countless Jedi, no two have ever had a connection
that is stronger than these two fucking buffoons
who met a couple of times.
Hey man, Rey's pretty powerful.
Do you disagree with that?
Certainly don't disagree with that.
You know, if Kylo...
No, wait.
She rose to meet Kylo, so he must have been pretty powerful
except when he's not.
Remember how he beat her after she trained,
and she beat him before she was trained,
even though he was trained by Luke and Snoke?
And he only had one lesson to finish his training
according to Snoke and TFA.
Do you like how some people try to defend the end of TFA
by saying Kylo was untrained?
I think the writers are untrained.
I think this whole thing was a fucking disaster.
Brawn to each other because they stem
from the same metaphysical roots.
Rey accepted.
Oh, shut up.
Shut the fuck up.
They come from the same metaphysical roots.
Metaphysical roots.
I hate this.
Like, it's not metaphysical roots.
If anything, it's actual physical roots.
They're related.
They come from the same ancestral roots.
Like, if Palpatine created the...
It's really weird.
The same metaphysical roots.
It's like, fuck off.
The amount of stretching that you have to do
to try and pull one tiny little...
What is the thing?
This is simultaneously exhausting and new.
Like, we've not heard anyone trying to do this with Tross.
I haven't heard these words strung in a sentence
consecutively before.
Yeah, that is true.
...free of the power that the sheer will has over your outcome.
They're drawn to each other because they stem
from the same metaphysical roots.
Rey accepts it.
Kylo denies it.
And when he finally does accept his reality,
he can let his true connection shine through love with Rey.
The kiss makes sense.
Oh, no.
Oh, it makes sense.
It feels like an essay of a kid who has to defend
or really undefend.
That was his challenge.
But his problem here is that this guy is essentially
saying that Kylo's actions don't define him.
What really defines him is this metaphysical connection
in his love of Rey.
It's not all the terrible massacres that he's done.
It's not the murder.
It's not the killing.
It's not the capturing.
It's not the kidnapping.
All the actions that he takes, that isn't Kylo.
That's not Kylo.
This metaphysical thingy, that's really Kylo.
Like, no.
No.
Your actions are the most defining thing about you.
What a terrible message.
I just love that he was like, the kiss makes sense.
It's like, oh, Jesus.
When you're that desperate.
Because of their unspoken personal journey,
Rey dies.
And with her Palpatine, who revives her?
No, and not with her Palpatine.
No, no.
She still has this fucking blood.
The correct series of events to describe this as is
Palpatine dies, which is what he wanted,
but somehow doesn't end up being the thing he wants.
Rey then dies for some reason.
And then Ben dies to bring her back.
Her blood is still Palpatine blood.
Bloodline, it's a bloodline.
It's in the blood.
It's a physical thing.
It doesn't go away because you die and get resuscitated.
But the implication as well is that being a Palpatine
means that she was always at risk of being evil,
which to me is so bullshit.
It's like, no, everyone's at risk of being good and evil
to begin with.
It's all about the fucking prison.
Oh, your grandpa was evil.
That means you're evil now.
No.
This isn't the Bible.
It's just gay.
This whole thing is gay.
His life force, and with that, his journey,
love, lost his legacy, and name does as well.
Where is this in the film?
You're just making that shit up?
You're just fucking making that shit up.
I've had my tongue in people's assholes
and we don't have that kind of connection
and you're just making it up.
You're just making it up.
He's like, his soul and his journey, his experience.
The metaphysical roots.
Brags the metaphysical roots.
He's inside of her lips.
And he's like, no.
You're doing the metaphysical roots.
I want to hear that again.
It was just so true.
Ben Skywalker.
His life force enters her,
and with that, his journey, love, lost his legacy,
and name does as well.
Rey becomes a Skywalker by virtue
of Ben Skywalker's sacrifice.
She fulfills the path of the truth.
Oh, explain yourself.
Don't just say it, explain it.
He used his life energy to rescue her.
That means he's putting Skywalker-ness into her.
Don't you understand?
His energy is Solo Skywalker energy.
Hers is Palpatism.
When she died, the Palpatism energy left her.
And then when Ben resurrected her,
he gave her Solo Skywalker energy.
It makes sense.
I need to, this is one of those things
you ask him to explain.
Like, sit him down and say,
convince me that this is actually what happens.
People say he's a Solo, not a Skywalker.
He has Leia's blood, so, you know.
But it's too stupid in any way.
The idea that, like, he's putting Skywalker
and Solo-iness into her.
It's like, what?
Yeah, because Leia has Skywalker blood, Organa name.
She takes the Solo name, I assume,
while they're married.
They get a divorce.
She takes the name Organa back,
which makes the most sense.
And then, even with the bloodline,
is Kylo being a Skywalker and a Solo.
So, why do I bother?
Posting one through the mission of Kylo Ren.
Through the lineage of the Skywalker
and the life shared between them.
Rey's personal force combined
with the name of the Skywalker
is what wraps this entire saga up beautifully.
It all makes sense.
It all makes sense.
It's like, if you assume that everything
that this guy has said is totally logical.
If all we have to do is grant the premise
that everything he said is totally accurate and true,
then the conclusion totally makes sense as well.
Also, what a shitty way to turn on that lightsaber
if you're fighting with it.
Well, they're spinning the thing, yeah.
Yeah, you spin it.
It all makes sense as a meme in Gedelp 3.
I don't know what video we covered before,
but people say it all makes sense.
People like to say that when stuff doesn't make any sense.
I want us to grow beyond our preconceived notions.
Also, isn't it mandatory for lightsabers
to look as if you shouldn't hold them?
Like, only Dookus was, of all the lightsabers I've seen,
his is the one that looks actually ergonomic.
Like, all of the others don't look anything
like handles of actual weapons.
I'm like, man, it's kind of weird.
You'd think they'd all essentially look like swords
without the blade in them, you know?
But, no, I just, I'm imagining holding that in a fight
and thinking, man.
Instead of paying attention to the intellectual men.
And bind with the name of the Skywalker
is what wraps this entire saga up beautifully.
It all makes sense.
I want us to grow beyond our preconceived notions.
I want us to let fear be an example.
If it makes sense, then why would our preconceived notions
be at odds with it?
If it makes sense, then we'd be sitting here saying,
oh yeah, that totally makes sense.
I mean, it's possible for us to be mistaken, I understand that.
But like, he's implying that it's like,
you've got preconceived notions based on knowledge
you already have, and yet this editing makes sense
that you think doesn't make sense.
We're not saying we cannot be wrong.
We're saying that we have really, really strong references
to the point of near certainty.
And you haven't convinced us of anything.
Like, actually, yeah, if he sat down with someone
and legitimately tried to convince them
that this all makes sense, it would be a mess.
Like, where would you even begin?
An example, and failure be a teacher.
Most of all, I just want all of us
to be able to love Star Wars and love those stories
despite our youth.
Then it needs to be good, man.
No, just love it.
Just love it.
It can't be this nonsensical fucking garbage,
because we're not like you who just have no standards.
I'm guessing just no standards.
It's got to be good.
Paths we might not agree with.
People write these stories,
and their love is reflected in the characters.
What if they're not?
What if hateful people write them?
What happens then?
Yeah, the people who wrote this,
you would be forgiven for thinking.
What if Hitler wrote it?
What happens then?
Hey, Hitler wrote Mein Kampf,
and the man loved Germany.
But this guy would probably be like,
nah, that's hateful art.
That's his vision, though.
They're in.
We can't go back.
So like Rey, let's rise
and look forward with hope and joy.
Oh my god.
And may the force be with you all.
May the force be with you all.
Oh no.
Like, like what's there to be hopeful and joyful for?
Like everything's, like remember,
six planets got destroyed.
Luke was destroyed.
Han was destroyed.
Leia went out like a fart.
Chewie was an Uber driver.
Yeah, she was an Uber driver.
C-3PO was made fun of
and then forced to say
that Rey and Poe and Fid were his friends.
And then when he came back to life,
they made him still.
Yeah, really great.
I can't imagine what it must be like for a galaxy
for a galaxy to come to terms with the fact
that days ago or a year ago or whatever,
six planets full of people
got destroyed, blown up, gone,
billions dead.
Like, how do you, how do you look to the future
with hope and joy when that happened?
Oh yeah, the force was destroyed as well.
Oh yeah, then the force too.
Like, what's she gonna do?
Just be what Luke should have been the whole time?
Of course, the real Skywalker.
Thank you for watching.
And as always, stay thoughtful.
He's single-handedly embarrassed the piano.
I feel bad for knowing how to play the piano.
If the piano was a person, it'd be like,
please stop doing this.
It's almost just like, perfect.
The hidden themes of Disney Star Wars.
It's like, yes, that is the kind of video
you'd expect to pop up on eFAB.
It's all theology of the dark.
Hidden themes of Disney's Star Wars.
Video essay.
Video essay.
I don't know about you guys,
but I was blown away by the intellectualness.
The intellectualness?
Yes, that too.
I don't even, I feel, it's like a fever dream,
just blew past my memory.
Who watches this?
And they're like, yeah, this makes sense.
You have to be one of the most gullible morons
in the world to watch a video like this
and think that it makes any semblance.
There's just so much to go through,
like how he's concluded any of it.
It's very dense.
And then you watch a film,
you watch a video like yours or Sitch's
or Shad's or anything like that.
That just goes over.
Here's all the reasons why there aren't here,
all these contradictions.
Things literally do not make any sense.
And it's like cold, hard fucking facts about the film,
what happens, scenes, references, lines, dialogue.
And then it's this, which is just the opposite.
Just feelsy-wheelsy, artsy-fartsy,
make stuff up sub-context.
It's like two different worlds.
How's everyone doing?
I'm doing all right.
Well, I have to check out now because it's 10 a.m.
Nice and early.
Yeah, nice and early.
Yeah, it was a good chat, guys.
Before it starts again.
Yeah.
Yeah, exactly.
This is a good chat.
Intellicutal stream is all of it.
Intellicutal.
Do you want to tell the wonderful people in chat
what you get up to on your channel?
Oh, hey, guys.
Siffa bro.
Weekend Warrior.
I talk about how the Clintons are a demonic cabal.
A demonic cabal.
Who sacrificed Molok.
I couldn't believe that Hillary Clinton sacrifices.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Chickens rags chickens.
She's very picky about that.
If she sacrificed chickens, then that wasn't enough to beat Trump.
She should have sacrificed something bigger.
Yeah, like some kids probably.
She should have sacrificed Jeffrey Epstein.
Now he'd go like, oh, he's already here.
So sacrifice someone else.
Oh, I tried to, but he killed himself.
That's what they all say.
Well, my channel, that's one of my other channels.
And my main channel is about video games and movies.
And I want to I want to release a video about
no, not actually just Rise of Skywalker.
How about Disney Star Wars is a fucking narrative disaster piece.
So there you go.
So when can we expect such a video to drop?
Well, hopefully by the end of this week, if I hope so.
Go subscribe.
Otherwise you won't see it.
You fools.
This was fun, guys.
I'll see you when I see you again.
That is true.
Yep.
It is what it is.
Let's let's dab on the haters.
Dab on the hate.
Dab on the dyad.
Dab on the dyad.
Boom.
Well, this is fun, guys.
Have a good day or night wherever you are.
Thanks for coming here.
And we'll catch you around, dude.
Yeah.
See you later.
Bye.
Stay frosty.
Well, boy, why?
Stay until a cute hole.
How are you feeling, Jay Longbone?
You're right.
Oh, I'm good.
I'm good.
It's only like nine o'clock.
Got that.
Yeah.
The watch together still.
So there was the in the title, I did mention movie Bob's origins.
We might move that to another episode because we're running up to many an hour.
That first one, the hella greeter one, took a lot longer than I expected.
It was like five minute videos a few hours.
But there's quite a few super chats and streamlabs to get through.
So I figure it's best to give that a tacklearoo.
I'm sorry, chat.
We can't always get to what's in the title.
But obviously, movie Bob's origins.
We'll make sure to have a strong roster for once that is covered in the near future.
Yeah.
Is everyone good for me to start reading these out?
Yep.
Go for it.
Well, tell you what.
Let me let me.
I'll be right back.
Oh, my God.
Okay.
Have a look.
See.
There's one about a Mars size candy corn thing.
Maybe that's where we start.
All right.
Get that highlighted.
It's addressed to rags.
So I'll just wait on that a second.
The first one is.
Yes.
Oh, by the way, chat before I continue with super chats, I just wanted to say,
see, this is the making me read this out as if I'm saying it.
But this is super chat says TFA part three is just about finished editing.
It should be out Friday at the latest.
See, that's not true.
The editing on that is taking a very long time.
But most hours of the day going toward it and it's it's on the way.
But don't worry when it gets closer and closer, I will let you know.
I will be excited to get it out.
It's it's going to be long.
We'll get a three hour video at the very least.
The most probably three and a half, but I'm not sure yet.
All right.
Rags, a Mars size candy corn is about to hit Earth.
The only way to stop it is to let.
Oh, wait, we did read that one out.
I remember because I could see where that one was going.
Do you remember answering a question about ghost in the shell?
I do not remember it.
When was that?
Oh, yeah, we must have answered that.
Okay.
All right.
Bum bum.
Didi.
Yeah, I remember answering that.
Okay.
Third age from 2004 was mentioned in the movies.
What's your opinion on it?
I remember the ending feeling rushed because your party was basically
teleported from Palina Fields to the top of Sauron's tower between
scenes and he was the final boss.
Yeah, it's totally rushed.
It's kind of hard to to say because like I probably have to replay it again,
but I had loads of fun with that kick about and I had replayed it relatively
recently in terms of like over the years on the dolphin emulator.
It's it's charming.
I'm not sure I would go as far as saying it's a really good game.
I don't know.
It's kind of hard to know for sure.
I'd have to like really go into seeing how it's balanced and I guess how well
it all scales up as you as you progress and what the options are for different
parties.
But I mean, I remember it being fun, like gameplay wise.
The the funny part was it trying to give you a brand new like original
fellowship to do with whatever you wanted while also sort of having you do the
storyline of the fellowship in the films, but also not be them.
So like you were following them all the time parallel to it a bit.
Yeah, just behind them all the time.
And then you fight with Gandalf against the Balrog.
It's like that did that.
Yeah, you well, you you fight as Gandalf against the Balrog because he wipes
everyone else in like one move.
Yeah.
And then with Idriel, you just keep doing all of the Valor.
Yeah, I can't do shit.
There were some clearly correct choices of party members.
That's right.
That's the thing.
That's kind of it just broke the game.
Idriels or the Valor just broke the game.
Israel was the best and Hadhod could make people like invincible mountain
shield over and over again.
Yeah, it was just you'd always have those two which are both controlled by player
two.
By the way, I as player one, I played it with my brother because it's co-op.
I use Berithor because he's all right.
But clearly a huge power difference between the between the characters.
Combat was all I don't know.
I can't like I wouldn't play it again.
There was like I remember enough about it.
Tell you what I would if we could do like a co-op run online.
I would do the show.
Yeah, if we could play co-op online, I would.
Yes, because I'd be curious to see a lot of it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd be down.
I've been working on a time travel story for about a year and I have a scene where the
character goes to 2015 and people are frothing all over the upcoming episode seven.
Reminding him of the dark times ahead.
Love you massive.
Stay safe and wash your anuses.
Why?
Yeah, the washing of the anus takes longer than that.
That would ironically be pretty weird, wouldn't it?
To go back to 2015 when TFA is about to come out knowing what's going to happen with all of it.
Make a career out of it.
Absolutely.
Be like, I'm going to be on the first video out.
I'm going to get a video out before the film's even out.
Hi Rags.
Do you have an opinion on Jay Naylor?
Oh, he's a very talented artist.
Yeah, I really like his really, really like his work.
Really like a lot of the stuff he does.
Definitely one of my favorites.
Don't know anything about him as a person, though.
I don't know anything about him, but I'm a lover of his work.
Also, what's your favorite type of cheese?
Hmm, either.
Honestly, Brie and American.
No, Brie and Pepperjack.
Oh, it'd be cool to see you and Rags react to this.
What is this?
The chewy cabin.
You know what, a person who sent that in, I'll throw that into our selection.
We've got a lot of meme videos to record reactions to, the copyright stuff in them.
We'll need to sort that out.
We're a little bit booked up because we've got Batwoman to do and some other stuff,
but I'll get to it.
I'll put that on the selection so you'll be able to see that eventually
because that's definitely copyrighted.
It is what it is versus they did it okay the way that they did it versus
it's fine.
They're all fine.
Hello, Greedo versus Jared versus motion picture Robertson
in the three way battle of incredibly detailed objective analysis.
Um, I think there's a bit of a difference.
It is what it is.
Of course, it's like true.
You don't even say anything really the other way.
Yeah, that's that's like a nonsense.
It's a thing that you don't even need to say.
Um, uh, but they did it okay.
The way that they did it is redundant, uh, but it's not like tautologically.
I mean, you're essentially just saying it's okay, right?
Yeah, what they did was okay is essentially how you can shorten that.
They did it okay the way they did.
It's just an awkward way of saying what they did was or the way they did.
It was okay.
And the final one is it's fine.
They're all fine.
It's fine.
They're all fine is it depends on what they're referring to.
I mean, I guess that's the same thing again, right?
It's like they're all okay.
Instead of it being okay.
Yeah, if we're getting the second.
Yeah, the first one has to be true.
The second one, uh, is an awkward way to say something pretty non-committal.
Yeah.
It's an awkward way of saying a, uh, an opinion, essentially.
And the third one is also an opinion referring to more than one thing.
Bonjour ranks.
Hello.
Hi there.
Uh, next one says I've contracted the big gay.
So I've been pretty much bedridden.
Thanks for helping with the loneliness.
Um, well, no problem.
Hopefully you join the streams and the, uh, the Lord, the rings tisms that have been coming up.
We've still got for people who are curious after Lord, the rings tisms are done.
So Godzilla wrinkle in time, which jail on bone was actually there for that and free.
They, um, they, they weren't responding to it the way Brie Larson promised, but
we, you know, we recorded it all.
So it's fine.
Um, and toy story for that still hasn't come out.
I think there's only, is that the three?
There might be more than that.
Oh, there's a torchwood thing as well.
If Jay ever gets that to be released, but yeah, more stuff coming after
return of the King is attempted to release again, uh, in a couple of days.
We'll, we'll give that another shot.
Either way, more movie stuff is kind of what I'm getting there.
Rags, raggers poop with the door open.
Never.
First super chat you masses.
That's actually number five, number five.
Oh my God.
If there was a door to close, it will be closed.
It's Jay.
It's judge dread.
No way.
Jats long bone.
What's up my Ewok.
Damn.
See, Quentin's such a bad influence, man.
Uh, would you rather poop in the shower or pee in the bath?
So if you pee in the bath, you, I was assuming they require that you stay in the bath after
that's done.
So you're just, just chilling in there.
Not really.
Okay.
So, uh, I'm going to change to poop in the shower.
Doesn't it depend?
Like what it, cause if you could probably, if you, if you drop a nice solid, you know,
it just, it just stays in the corner and you have your shower that might actually
affect you less, right?
Than the pee in the bath.
Well, you can just pee over the, you can just poop over the drain.
Do you get to choose where you poop?
Well, surely you always get to choose or you poop.
Yeah.
Cause the pee, it doesn't matter where you choose, right?
That's just.
Yeah.
Cause the pee is going to be everywhere around you and you have to, right?
However, you can poo in the, you just imagine the sound of it in the bottom of the tub,
but you could, you could poo in the shower, but still take a total and complete shower
and be totally clean because, you know, gravity and the water going down and all that stuff.
But if you pee in the bath and that is all in the bath water, then.
Yeah.
I feel like you've, you can't get away from it.
You know, you can't get out.
So assuming that you have to, you know, do that, then yeah, then I'm going to say,
I'm going to say that you're in a sterile is like,
uh-huh, I ain't exactly my issue.
It's the smell of it and having it being all over me.
Wait, would you poop standing up?
Oh no.
Yeah.
That could, I could do stuff, right?
You could, you could like crouch.
Oh, you could like, you can like slides down your leg.
What about that?
You need to shower it off.
You could, yeah, you've got, you can, you're in a shower.
If there's ever a time to poop on yourself, it's while you're taking a shower.
Yeah.
But that stench like shower waters over from bath water, bath water.
Like you're immersed in, you know.
Yeah.
The shower will, it will carry it away from you and be gone and you will have it.
Yeah, but it'll be all over your feet.
What if you have like a really long shower and it breaks, it breaks the poopy apart.
It all drains down the drain.
Yeah.
Like poop still has like residue.
So like the one's still going to grab the water.
You have soap, like it's a civilized nation and it's the 21st century.
They did not specify that this was a first world country.
Even then you, the fact that you can, even if it's just running water
and you rubbing it off, you will still come out.
Okay.
And if you're taking a shower, it is implied that you have soap
and the whole point of soap is to clean you.
If you don't trust the soap and water, then why are you trusting?
Why are you taking a bath in the first place or shower in the first place?
If you don't think it'll do its job.
Shower is this thorough when it comes to shit.
That is, you have all the time you need and you can check and you can look and see yourself.
What kind of shit are we talking about?
Like, like, I don't know, like play-doh or like soft serve ice cream.
Like what consistency are we talking here?
I guess, I guess we have to answer that ourselves.
Yeah.
I mean, mine is, I can't, we're, we're, we're, we're doing this.
I can't describe his shit that he's stopped.
Because mine comes out pretty clean.
I mean, like, I don't, like I've got a pretty good diet for it.
It's just, it's done.
It's just out, you know, like I don't, it doesn't, I don't, I'm fine.
I don't have any issues in that aspect of my life.
I mean, I got my toilet paper and my wet wipes.
So you're saying you'd let it out, you'd kick it down to the drain and then you'd shower
off any problems that may have happened as a result.
Yeah, you could.
Yeah.
And then you'd be totally fine as if it was never there because it is a shower,
the point of the shower.
And if you can't be clean after that, that's on you and your bathing ability, not the shower.
Yeah.
All right.
There you go.
We have the answer.
Nailed it.
There.
This is what, see, I originally said pee in the bath water, but then I was like,
Oh, nope.
Think rags.
Use that.
Use that brain ears.
There you go.
Also, he wants to meet.
Did Smiler.
I'll get his name from the amusement park ride, the Smiler.
He has mentioned that and his icon relates to that, but I'm pretty sure unless he can
tell you more about this, I could have sworn he got the Smiler from Theon's horse in Game of Thrones.
What someone said, use the turd like a bar of soap.
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah, I'd have to ask him to be certain on that one.
This one says South Pole fix your mic.
Damn.
Just just that overflow from last time.
Why aren't you outside clapping?
It's eight o'clock.
I'm busy.
And I don't think that was for every day.
That was for a specific day.
Mugely, is this Haldier?
Oh, you remember that, Rags?
Haldier.
Haldier.
That video will go back up, I swear.
How much money do I need to give to kick Jay?
Cheers.
He's been kicked?
Three.
Yeah.
It's like Rage of Shadow Legends.
Thoughts on the great outdoors with John Candy.
I don't think I've seen that, assuming that's real.
Haven't seen it.
I like the great outdoors, though, just.
Yeah, it's a neat place.
I like them.
Have you guys watched Upper Echelon's Tismy Doom Eternal review yet?
He's also been dismissing criticisms as people fanboying.
I've been sent that.
Yeah, someone linked it in my Discord.
I need to fucking obliterate Doom Eternal.
I need to play the shit out of it.
I just haven't gone around to it yet.
Because right now, where I am, I'm right about to finish the last mission
and I'll replay it and do some other stuff with it.
But so far, I think it's OK.
I think it's OK.
It's not bad.
It's definitely not bad.
I do think there are some.
There are definitely things I do not like about it,
but I got to play it some more and stuff like that.
But it's it's good.
It's hard.
Because the next question was thoughts on Doom Eternal.
So I don't have them yet.
I will have.
There you go.
There you go.
Everyone drink lots of water.
If the virus is in your throat, about to enter your lungs,
the water will push it to the stomach acids, killing it.
Say that one more time.
I don't know if this is true.
It just says drink lots of water,
because if the virus is in your throat, about to enter your lungs,
the water will push it to your stomach acids instead, killing it.
Yeah, drinking fluids is just a good good solid idea all the time.
Anyway, we evolved to drink fluids.
Fluids.
We're good at it.
Yeah, water is good for you.
I drink a lot of tea.
That's the mini pee breaks that I take.
So drink your water.
Drink your water.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
It's the end of the world as we know it.
I'm just about to wrap up this bud light.
That's basically butter.
I feel fine.
Mostly because I'm pooping with the door open.
Oh, they feel good about the end of the world
because they're pooping with the door open.
Doesn't that support Rags's theorem that it's a bad thing to do?
What do you think brought on the end of the world there?
I think if enough people did simultaneously.
It would, yeah.
All the poo stank would get out into the atmosphere.
And it would, you know, end civilization.
It only makes sense.
Can you imagine a pile of poo that all of humanity has created?
Don't just ignore me.
Just carry on.
Have you seen Beast?
Don't know.
I've skipped ahead maybe.
Oh, no, I have.
Have you seen Beast stars?
I love it.
I'm not a fairy.
No, I have.
I've heard it's good, but I just I haven't seen it.
Just not a not a fan of anime, but I've heard it's good.
Maybe one of these days, I'll check it out.
Maybe one of these days.
Yeah, I'm not even sure what it is.
I think people have recommended it before.
Did you hear that Jabbie might have the virus?
Well, that's not good.
Yeah, it's terrible.
And I really, really don't want fucking anybody to have it at this point,
because not only does that help less people get it in general,
but it means less suffering for the people, too.
Fucking it's an asshole of a virus.
I'm going to I'm going to my my hot take is I don't like it.
I do not like the virus.
I'm not hearing a lot of competition in that regard.
Like I'm not hearing counter arguments.
So I think that what I say makes some sense.
So I'm going to yeah, I'm just going to commit to that position.
Until I looked at the description, I thought that dread was doomcock.
Oh, how does that feel?
Someone thought you were a doomcock.
Dredcock.
Rags.
Dredgecock.
All bit free fat movies.
It would be funny.
I don't know if it would work.
I'm not sure how that would go.
Like watching.
Maybe we found someone who made like scathing videos about him.
Oh, like just right.
Passion.
And I would definitely value him.
Yeah, it would be really interesting to have his input on that.
We just talk about we just tell him, no, he doesn't understand the themes.
Tornado about to hit downtown Pittsburgh.
Warn everyone, please.
That's awful.
If true.
Well, I mean, it's probably already happened.
But yeah, I hope you guys made it.
Yeah, I hope it's not as bad as it can be rags.
Would you huff my internet gas if I promised it would give you superpowers?
That depends on what the superpowers are, honestly.
Because here's the thing about that screen time, right?
Those of you don't know, screen time is a new Marvel superhero.
And he was exposed to the internet gas.
And now he's connected to the internet basically 24 seven and can Google anything.
The horrifying thing about that is that that means he's connected to all the child pornography
and the ISIS heading videos and all the other terrible, horrible, horrible things that are
on the internet all the time, which would be interesting if they played it off as a
he's constantly struggling with whether humanity is good or not, or if it's even worth saving.
And he's depressed a lot of the times.
And he always has to surround himself with friends.
And he's a good role model for people who might be depressed or who might really be
down all the time.
And he rises above that.
And he gives a good positive message.
But I would not, were I a gambling doggo, put my money down that they would be able to do that.
What's on the Idubbbz controversy?
I only know a little bit about it and his girlfriend and his reaction.
I haven't seen this stuff yet.
I don't know anything about it.
Give me what do I not know?
Well, I guess.
Go ahead.
Oh, OK.
Well, his girlfriend like started like this, a whole lot of fucking behind the
apparently she's a moron.
She's apparently using him.
And she's just not all she's not she's not right.
Let's just say that she's she's kind of shitty.
And then she started an OnlyFans account, which before then he paid for her to have a
boob job.
So I'm guessing that kind of ties into the OnlyFans thing.
But like this, it's a culmination of that people like people are calling him a simp,
basically, because he supports the shitty girlfriend, despite her being shitty.
And people don't.
And then you got people simping for Idubbbz saying you can't have an opinion about it
because none of the ones business, despite the fact that he released a fucking nine
minute video on his own channel to his seven point nine million viewers.
Like reaffirming his simp status with that coupling with that coupling with everything
everyone knows about his girlfriend thus far.
Like it doesn't look good for the downvotes aren't looking.
These are the most downvotes I think I've ever seen Idubbbz have on a video.
It doesn't.
You know, I was going to say he's kind of an internet golden boy.
Yeah.
And now people will help.
Just leave him alone.
Business like fucking upload nearly eight million subscriber channels.
That's what you expect people to do.
So what's like what's the what's the expected end to this thing that's happening then?
Oh, I don't know.
I think people are just like like his fans.
Some of his fans want him to get away from.
Just Italy at the very least.
Just why couldn't you just like not say anything?
Like if it was so irrelevant, it didn't mean anything.
If people's opinions don't mean anything, just don't fucking say anything.
You could salvage what dignity you have left by just just saying, hey,
like my girl, my girl is a shit or just not say anything.
I think there she seems to be a the girl.
A lot of people have a lot of problems with the girlfriend herself and what she's done.
And the only fans thing was kind of like a breaking point for a lot of them.
And his handling of it has apparently been really terrible.
I don't know yet.
I need to I'll read through stuff.
Like I'm kind of skimming over a comment here,
but there he's been deleting comments about it on the video and stuff.
Oh, it's hard to confirm that, isn't it?
Yeah, it was it was it was this popular comment of someone like chronic.
Here, I'll post it.
But there I think there are ways to find out.
A lot of people sometimes claim it because of how it like,
it gets whatever reported or something like that.
But apparently seems to be a thing and it's happening with other comments as well.
So I mean, the one thing I would say is that if he's deleting the man,
he's doing ones as new as 10 minutes ago.
It's like it must be also 10 minutes ago.
2K upvotes.
Holy shit.
Yeah, don't know anything about it.
But, you know, I have to see what like,
I'm assuming it's not going to get any bigger than it is now.
And it does seem to be over something that's like probably solvable.
Potentially solvable.
Problem seems to be her is a big thing.
That's what people have a problem with.
It's her.
People are like, yeah, clowning them and calling them a simp and all that.
But, you know, that's whatever.
She's the one who's really causing people to react the way they're reacting.
I got this comment here.
You've ignored most of the reasons why people are upset.
The only fans was the cherry on top.
I'm not even upset she's creating an OnlyFans account.
I'm upset at what a hypocrite she is.
She slut shamed other women before.
She says she's body positive and all that stuff,
but then goes off to make fun of people that are bigger or fat.
She said she's struggling with eating disorders,
and yet goes on to make fun of other people with eating disorders.
She's stolen art from other creators.
She openly said that the Holocaust was a beneficial thing.
There's probably a lot more others can add on to.
What I'm trying to say is you're just answering,
oh, I'm fine with her making an OnlyFans account
and you fucking retard incels need to get off my ass.
Not her hypocritical actions and personality.
Weren't you the content cop that hated hypocrites?
Hold her accountable for her actions.
If you want to date a shit person, go ahead,
but have an explanation to the people that look up to you,
care about you and support you as to why.
Oh, and the fact that she cheated on her ex-boyfriend with you.
Cheaters will cheat again.
Just a little tidbit for you.
And yeah, I know if I had a girlfriend and she cheated on her ex-boyfriend with me,
I would feel pretty shitty about that.
Like if I knew she had a boyfriend,
then I wouldn't do anything.
This bro is a four-hose, that sort of thing.
He wouldn't feel good about it.
Wouldn't be right.
Wouldn't be right.
And plus it shows that she's not,
that she doesn't hold being, you know,
faithful to a person she's in a relationship with to very high regard.
And if she wants that to be me next,
then I'm just setting myself up for disappointment.
True to the dat.
But this is, of course, all allegedly.
I don't know.
I don't know too much about it.
Hello, Massives.
Nice avatar, Jay.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hello.
Also, Chatteroonie.
Just a heads up.
TFA part three is almost finished and hopefully,
not making any promises,
but I'm hoping to have it out next week.
That's from Creamy Chief Palpatine.
Apparently, he's making his own TFA series.
Nice.
Oh my god.
You can't possibly be referring to mine,
because as Rags said, possibly a year ago,
it would be out in August 2020.
And I'm going to make that deadline.
Do you understand that?
It's going to happen.
And then, as soon as I get it out,
then the efap following that,
Rags will decide when part four is going to be coming out.
I'm going to have to really have a big thong
about what kind of date to set for that one.
If you travel through time, forwards or backwards,
and have sex with yourself, is it gay or masturbation?
It's gay.
No, no, no, no, no, no disagreements with that.
All right.
Yeah, I'm on board.
Yeah, I guess just to round it out,
if you go back in time, if you go forward in time,
if you clone yourself, you're creating another person.
That isn't you.
We only say that in a more colloquial sense.
That is a separate entity, right?
Like, it has to do things like consent,
and it has its own ideas and thoughts,
which is from you and experiences.
And it will immediately deviate from you as well,
even if it was a clone.
Yes.
So, it isn't...
It's not masturbation.
Definitely having sex with someone else.
This simply says, I care for you, Jay, with hearts.
Kind of offensive.
Jay, you should review Minecraft Story Mode Season 1 and 2.
For those of you who want something hilarious to watch,
go to Broteen Pill's channel.
He did streams where he played those.
There's highlights on his channel.
One of the most enjoyable set of YouTube videos I've ever watched
is him playing through the Minecraft Story Mode,
and making fun of how garbage it is.
I played it on my Twitch channel. It was really bad.
It was the most viewers I'd ever had, though.
I remember being like, why?
Why do people want to share all this?
What do you think of Smallville?
I personally always compared it to Buffy,
mixing normal teen life with Supernatural
and a school as bad as Hogwarts.
Smallville character work wasn't too impressive to me.
I watched all 10 seasons, though,
and I actually watched it because Spike was in it.
James Mars was Brainiac.
And it was fine.
I remember just thinking, it's fine,
but I don't think I'd watch it again.
It's better than anything on the CW, though,
or at least from what I've seen.
Oh my god, an Efap during quarantine?
The perfect time for you, Massifs.
Also, High Rags.
Oh, he's muted.
I'll have to make sure he gets that one as soon as he returns.
Oh, he's shitting in the shower.
Yep.
He's not the kind of doggo to pee in the bath.
We know this.
When it comes to story,
character concepts, and developments,
is this such a thing as being fundamentally flawed?
Or is it always a matter of writing execution?
Stay safe.
Love you guys.
So it's complicated because just the married bachelor thing, right?
It's like if you have two Is's that can't possibly coexist.
But even then, you might think to yourself,
like, what about a monster who has humanity?
You know, like, that sounds completely at odds with itself.
And it's like, well, actually,
that's what the premise of Angel of the show is.
So really, I guess I want to say it's about execution every time.
And whatever concept you come up with,
it would just be a matter of chiseling away
until you sort of find a way to make it settle.
Execution always matters more than the idea anyway.
You can have like a really boring idea,
but execute it amazingly.
Like, guy who goes to the store to pick up groceries.
That's your premise.
Like, whoa.
Can't imagine what's gonna happen with this,
but then you could like really write it basically.
I don't know.
I kind of assumed Mola would love the Luther's.
I just saw that in chat.
I actually do remember liking Lidle Luther a lot.
The actor's name was John something, right?
John...
John...
Glover?
He's the...
He was in Gremlins too.
And yeah, and I liked...
And I remember being annoyed that Lex Luther wasn't in like seasons,
I want to say seven through 10,
because he like...
There was some kind of...
Something went on behind the scenes that booed him out,
but he came back in the final episode, I think.
But I remember liking Lionel Luther a lot.
Mm...
By the way, chat.
TFA part four should be ready for May.
Oh my god.
Creamy sheave just promising all the TFA videos.
Long manual.
TLJ critique split the Russian film review community.
I don't even know what that is, but all right.
Anyway, have you been, guys?
I've been...
Well, I believe Rags has.
How have you been?
Oh.
I'm here.
I'm here.
What's up?
What I miss?
How have you been?
I've been well.
I've also been not so well.
I've been a lot of things, actually.
I think I've been most things.
Sweet.
That's the human experience right there.
The full rainbow of experiences.
I don't know anything about a human experience.
I suppose it's comparable for the most part.
Right now I'm feeling good.
I'm not sick or anything like that.
Woohoo.
And I plan to keep it that way.
There was also a high Rags that you missed.
Oh, hello to you.
Come on.
By the way, don't kick Jay.
He'll get Corona outside.
He apparently already has it inside.
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
The outside might even help him at this point.
You know, spread it away from him.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Mauler.
Hello.
And everyone.
Hello.
What do you think about Bill and Ted 3 coming out?
I hope it's good.
I'm sure it'll be great.
I hope it's good as my answer for all of these.
It's a dim hope, but I hope nonetheless.
I'm not usually into that franchise,
but I have good Keanu's in it, so.
He's going to be in The New Matrix too.
Oh, there we go.
Now that one I'm worried about.
Because the Wachowskis haven't been good in a while.
I have a feeling they're going to be heavily influenced by John Wick.
It's such a weird thing to think about.
Like Matrix will try and catch up with John Wick now.
I heard somebody say, oh, The Matrix will be great
as long as they have Keanu Reeves in it.
And I was like, do you remember like Matrix 2 and 3?
It's the same logic as well.
It's like, oh, you know, Star Wars new sequel trilogy would be great
as long as they have Luke and, you know.
And he's like, oh.
Down that road.
I wish they had 10 instead of 9.
It felt rushed in terms of like Star Wars episodes, I guess.
I mean, if they had an extra if they had the four episodes for their trilogy,
who knows how much worse it would get.
Yeah, I wish they had six.
I wish they had enough to make it good.
Whatever that requirement is.
Inferno Plus did a video on copyright abuse on YouTube
when he showed that a company had a job called Video Claimant Expert.
Oh, yeah.
That's a thing.
I wasn't kidding.
That's a thing.
Hmm.
I'm already like, I'm not I'm not normally one to make fun of people's jobs,
but if that's your job, kill yourself.
It is a bit of a fucking frustrating job to know someone has, isn't it?
I mean, in all fairness, if they're doing it to capture shit,
that's actually like, you know, trying to raise mostly bots, catch it anyway.
I'd be surprised that they ever do it in a justified manner.
Most people aren't stupid enough to re-upload full movies or episodes or whatever.
And not be cool anyway.
What movie would they like?
How much money would they actually lose by taking it from the channels
compared to how many false times it gets hit?
Because you hear the horror stories and people telling, you know,
and showing that they've gotten all of these flags and all of these claims
that are completely and totally false manually by some company
on behalf of some other company doing it as a thing.
I'm like, I think I think the cure is worse than the disease.
I agree.
Hi, Moeller and Jay.
Hello.
How are you enjoying UK White House arrest?
Oh, you know, it happens.
It's it's worth it.
That's what I would say to smooth out that curve as they were saying.
Isn't it ironic that these idiots say we resemble the first order?
How?
We're diverse and.
Because of house arrest.
And we dress well.
Also, it says hashtag kick rags.
Oh, no.
Unbelievable.
And hashtag go back to the OT.
Yeah.
And you chose the best guests for this episode.
Heart heart.
Well, there's some some compliment.
Yeah, pretty good, pretty good.
I give them a thumbs up and then a second thumbs up.
I find it likely an efap hater sends messages that a small channel is talking smack about
their products.
They are sort of no lifers.
Well, if that's your job, then you just Google it and you go to YouTube.
You type the keywords in and you sort by time and upload date and.
You look around and if that's your job to find it, you'll probably find it.
Hey, Papa rags.
Hello.
I've thought about this and I need a second opinion.
Is more just the evolved form of PSA, such more is more unbiased, provides more content
and his jokes hit harder than stitches.
Is this true?
I don't think that's true.
I don't know about that.
I think they're different and special in their own way.
I think he didn't.
He and I have drawn on TROS for length as far as I know.
As for me being more unbiased, I'd say he's pretty unbiased.
Certainly in his movie reviews, it's been good shit.
I haven't seen all of his catalog.
I don't know as much about his political stuff.
And produces more content.
I'm not actually sure that's true on I produce more than he does, but it could.
It could be.
I'd have to check all the numbers and stuff.
You know, we're more, you know, we're not we're brothers in Longman.
That's that's that's the the crest we have.
All right.
Makes total sense.
Everyone's at home.
Everyone's online.
No bandwidth or that would suck.
I sure hope Mooper is still a chronophobe.
A gedel lasting longer than 15 to 20 minutes might be more hazardous than the coronavirus.
I think it's the longest gedel be at.
It's like 20, I'd say 27, maybe 23 minutes.
I can't remember now.
Just keep getting longer.
Rose is a retard.
Finn only liked hoes.
Watch hardcore Henry.
You fucking dumbos.
One day.
First super chat found the perfect instrument for you.
Just Google translate bassoon from English to German.
Okay.
English.
Oh, I didn't know that.
That's interesting.
Have you checked it?
Yeah.
I wonder what the little robot lady would say.
I shouldn't try it, but I will find out.
It's more like for goat.
A very offensive Google.
How dare you?
Honest Trailers stole your fake name joke.
I've not seen their trust video yet, but I shall have to check it out then.
How dare they steal my jokes.
I am offended.
I all, I know it was brought up a while ago, but please watch Supergirl.
It's so bad.
The time where they took all the bulletproof people off world
so they can talk about gun control as a highlight.
We've thought about it.
Oh, wait, this is an idea there.
It's just like, what would we do?
Watch it from the beginning or maybe pick up after infinite.
Wait, we're saying which one?
Oh, the Supergirl.
Yeah, I've seen some bad stuff.
Uh, you see the compilations on YouTube that are all terrible.
I don't know, man.
I think that's the thing.
Batwoman is, we got a long, long way to go with Batwoman who knows
what other incredible television programs we'll have to talk about by the time Batwoman wraps up.
Yeah.
Take my, take many of my prized shimmy geckles were it not for this podcast.
I pretty much still be one of the bad ones you see on Twitter.
Stay safe, everybody.
Oh, my.
One of the bad ones.
Hi, Rags and Longman.
Hope you guys are well.
Hello.
And yes, what?
Well, I got to recommend upper echelon gaming's Doom Eternal review for Efap.
It gets so much wrong.
It's impressive as he dismisses criticism toward it.
I mean, it seems like a lot of people want us to cover this one.
And if I can just get around to completing Doom,
it could finally be an Efap about a game.
How long has it been, Rags?
How long has it been?
I don't even know the last one.
I feel like the last one was episode one when we covered Tonal.
No, Jetta, fall in order.
Tonal didn't fall in order.
It was probably Tonal no matter what, right?
Because he's a gaming channel.
So yeah.
I contributed to Efap.
Yay, Darth Maul rises.
Spelt the same way he spelt it in the video.
The Maul, love it.
Have you seen Knives Out?
We're still supposed to set that up with Critical Drinker.
I've spoken to him.
We're getting there eventually.
It's in the works.
I actually found it to be pretty good.
Didn't see any major plot holes.
Ryan's style works well for an independent mystery.
I could very well.
We shall see.
Maybe it'll be the first Efap movies where we go,
oh, this is actually really good.
Implying that Lord of the Rings aren't good,
but you already know that we think those are amazing.
Hi, Mauler.
Hello.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Kick J, naturally.
So glad I can listen to you guys
while I'm outside in 98 Fahrenheit.
Dry heat pushing carts.
I maybe saw, but I got you guys.
Aw.
Don't boil.
And drink your liquids.
We got that earlier as advice.
Make sure you got a little bottle with you or something.
Drink, drink.
Oh, we could bring Sausage Doom Man
onto the one where we cover that video maybe.
That'd be interesting.
Yeah.
Tell me, young toxic brood,
do you know the tragedy of Darth Maul of the Peeved?
P.S., promote J. Longbone and Kick J.
Well, see, how many people were satisfying
by having Kick J already?
Hyperspacing the Death Star to get around
is a colossal waste of fuel.
Destroying the main planet first is a waste of time.
Destroying the main planet is a waste of time.
Do you mean it?
Well, because it'll fuck up.
The only reason, I think, that you could pull
for why they should have done either of those things
is if they knew they were in extreme danger.
But the thing is, Tarkin didn't.
Yeah, if it's just a matter of,
all we got to do is wait,
and we'll just orbit and see it in a few moments.
So we'll just blow it up then.
Yeah, it's like, oh, you can destroy it in five minutes
or we can do some plan to maybe destroy it faster than that.
And Tarkin's just like, just destroy it in five minutes.
Fine.
It's like, sir, there may be some kind of weakness.
And he's like, lol, some kind of weakness, okay.
Rules of light color dispersion.
White has more colors of light spectrum,
while darker tones are a lack of color.
So wouldn't white people be persons of color?
Oh, my God.
Crack the code.
Hyperlanes are just empty places in space
so you can fly through it safely,
not a tunnel where you can't stop.
Again, I don't know why these aren't,
like those aren't in the movies.
You'd think they would want to have that in there.
Interesting that they didn't.
It's a good limiter.
I feel numb where love used to be regarding Star Wars.
It's dead to me.
So I'm not going to be sticking around for this.
Have fun, guys.
I'll catch the super chats on Moolah.
Remember to water your me's from Jeb.
That's the account John Ellis Bush Bush.
John Ellis Bush Bush.
Please say you're all working on more Batwoman.
The show is getting good, quote unquote.
So the next one should be out within a week's time,
I think, in terms of our reactions to it.
And we're recording more very soon.
We're very happy to get on with Batwoman.
We got a bit of a delay because we're between editors.
Because obviously it's honestly a tragedy
because I absolutely adore the editor we currently have.
Those videos are very amusing.
But he's doing work for like three YouTubers at once.
So he's decided he won't be able to maintain the Batwoman ones
because I was added onto that list, if you will.
So I was like, OK.
And he's giving me contacts for a new editor.
So once that gets sorted, we should be back on.
And I think Batwoman is going to be going on a relatively
long hiatus, considering they've had to break up season two now
because of coronatisms and everything else.
So we should catch up to it eventually, is what I'm saying.
But excitement ahead, Batwoman.
Yes, Palps baited them because it was a trap.
Hey, Rags, please play the incredibly average RE3 demo.
People are creaming their pants over it, and I don't know why.
I probably will sometime.
I'd like to check it out.
Give it a look.
So why don't you put out eFap movies as commentary too?
So the way they chopped up into eFap movies
is basically getting rid of anything that's gaps or not funny,
while the audio commentaries on my channel
are essentially designed from the ground up
to have a lot more discussion in them.
eFap movies is more like reacting to and having fun with,
while audio commentaries are actually
trying to talk about what I, with the guest,
what I think works or things about the movie
and the actors and the history and stuff.
It's two different things.
I guess what I'm trying to say is
that you wouldn't want the role version of the commentary
that we record for eFap movies.
You would probably want the supercut.
The supercut will be much more entertaining.
And then there's the other problem of,
I would have to re-release it as a track, I guess,
instead of the way we do it.
Because obviously, making a supercut
has the added bonus of getting out of copyright annoyances
as well, being that you chop it up.
And it's less work for you.
Technically, it's more work.
Like the audience.
Yeah, oh yeah.
This is the thing.
It's all for the benefit of the audience.
You guys will absolutely prefer the supercuts
compared to the tracks.
Or at least, theoretically, you should.
Because it's just delivery of all of the entertaining parts,
quote unquote, versus the gaps.
But we're just sitting there watching the movie.
Or God forbid, one of us tells a joke
that's just not that funny.
Which hasn't happened yet.
It's more of a precaution.
Yeah, you know, it could happen.
One day, you never know.
You can crash into mass shadows in hyperspace,
but I'm not sure it would affect
the actual object in real space.
Mass shadows?
I have no idea what that is.
I don't even know what that is.
A good fix would be a reason similar to BTTF.
You would need to be a certain speed
before you go at hyperspeed.
So the distance before would be so short
enemies would blast you into bits.
Um, BTTF, back to the future, I guess.
I guess because they had to get up to 88 miles an hour,
and then they could time travel.
Yeah, you need to be a certain speed
to go hyperspace to the distance.
Before that would be so short,
enemies would blast you to bits.
I'm not sure what that's addressing specifically.
Like what scenario that either helps or does something for.
I guess it wouldn't let you instantly hyperspace away
from things.
But then again, the big problem here is that
once a ship is basically guaranteed to lose,
then it will just kamikaze hyperspace.
And yeah, it fucks everything up.
Like I said before, this will be the one super tactic
that all of space warfare will be essentially based around.
Also, Bayouin said, folks misunderstand hyperspace lanes.
They aren't the sole routes through space.
They are the known fastest routes
between strategic trade points.
Ships can still hyperspace elsewhere.
Oh, yeah, clearly.
I mean, that's what I always assumed.
I didn't think that you'd have to commit
to a particular lane first.
I mean, I'm stopping you.
I've never been a detail-oriented Star Wars viewer.
Bruh, this is what your channel was built on.
You shout on the special editions.
That's what I thought.
Yeah, and then there were the thumbnails
Jay found about the fucking font of the R,
but not a detail-oriented.
No, it's not about the details, really.
Christian Grey and now Kylo Ren.
Jay Longbone tries to be above the bad boy love,
but we can see right through it.
Come to the-
Oh, man.
Hey, hang on.
Cut that shit out right now.
I don't like these characters.
I definitely don't like Kylo that much.
But he's such a great complex character.
Yeah.
And like the Christian Grey thing,
I know exactly what the character is.
It's just a character who happens
to be hot in a fuck movie.
That's about it.
Hot in a fuck movie?
Yeah, boy.
I mean, it ends with,
come to the BB side, we have cock.
Not bad.
Efap movie, The Cat in the Hat.
I haven't seen that in a long time.
That's been a long time.
Do those that poop with the door open,
haven't you learned from Tywin
at the end of season four of Game of Thrones?
Yeah, it's true.
Like Rags, one of your many points
has been that someone could hit you
with a crossbow if you do that, right?
That's very true.
I've said that many times.
I've probably said it multiple times.
I think you say that's like your main argument,
maybe even your only.
I always bring it up whenever the question arises.
Hold over maneuver.
Hold over maneuver versus Timeless Child,
which destroyed a franchise fastest.
I feel like that's a Jay question.
That's why I heard that Timeless Child
is a really bad.
I just listened to some people talk about it
and it basically just is.
It's awful.
I will save that question
for when Jay's around.
He'll be interested to see
because he's got insight on both fandoms.
But yeah, I mean,
it'll be interesting to see
if chat have a have an idea
of which they think is worse
if their fans are both.
I was out of Doctor Who a long time ago.
Given your thoughts on Godzilla,
I highly recommend
the 90s Gemera trilogy for Efap movies.
It's widely regarded as the cream of the crop
for Kaiju cinema,
and I'm curious to see how you'd react.
I mean, I don't know if that would work
for Efap movies.
If they're movies,
you just want us to actually check out.
That'll be one thing.
But like if our movies were trying to,
there's a specific kind of movie you need.
Like, for example,
I'm not even sure Knives Out will work,
but we'll give it a shot, you know.
We got loads here.
I'm sure it'll work.
Yeah, I hope so.
I mean, Lord of the Rings works,
so who knows?
That's true.
Busy ripping and tearing.
I'll catch this on Moolah.
We shall see you there.
Ray's Force Child with Kylo
is a Palpatine clone
who goes back in time
to impregnate Shmi Skywalker.
It makes absolute sense
in Star Wars canon.
Yeah, totally.
That's episode 10 right there.
Gonna bring it all back.
Yeah, man.
Like, why not?
Episode 10.
The Phantom Menace is born.
Get it?
Because Phantom Menace is the first episode.
So it's really clever how it rhymes.
All children are menaces.
Gonna get Major Leon to talk about Trost?
I know that dude is tismy,
but there's something unexplainably likable
about his ignorance.
Rye Hags.
Rye.
Um, I mean,
could be amusing to have him on, I guess.
Have him on and cover his video with him.
I don't know.
That'll be trippy.
Uh...
Small soldiers for e-fat movies.
That's a possibility.
I don't know how much commentary
we could get out of it
instead of just watching it, you know?
Could be funny.
Um, My Hauler.
My.
And Jik-K.
He has been jicked.
In the prestige book,
Angier becomes a ghost.
I should read that out of curiosity
to see how the film differs, but
that sounds like an interesting development.
Um, and a dose of Buckley is back.
He'd be an awesome guest.
I don't think I know who that is.
I forget.
Something makes me want to say that's familiar, but...
Is he the guy who does What the Buck?
I don't know.
That show that was like one of the earliest things on YouTube.
That could be something else.
Thoughts on Meet the Parents?
I liked it when it came out.
I haven't seen that one in a long time.
Remember it?
Do you remember Meet the Fockers?
I do.
I think I do, yeah.
It's been so long, though.
I just can't remember it.
Like, I remember it as a thing,
but I don't, like, remember the movie.
Oh, apparently that's a different person
I was talking about.
Yeah, fair enough.
Um, but yeah.
I haven't seen Meet the Parents in ages,
but I'd probably put a bit of a gabble
on that one being good.
I remember it just being fun.
Jay Longbone's laugh is more contagious than COVID-19.
That is a compliment.
It's the death rate.
Jay Long's laugh is like the wicked witch
in the best way.
I don't get you, my pretty.
Yeah, my siblings used to say I
laughed like Chucky for a while.
Rags is on fire with these puns.
We need morkins.
See, I told you.
Yeah, I mean, if that guy said it,
yeah, there's no question.
Mola, could you please read out Hollow Men
verse five in your epic narrator voice.
I think it would sound better when
than when Marlon Brando read it.
Also, Hi Rags,
weekend warrior Jay Longbone and Jay,
the best sassy black woman.
Hi.
Hollow Men verse five.
What even is my epic narrator voice?
You talking about the one for the
Night Dragon King one, maybe?
Eight step.
Uh.
Yeah, so it's a bit long and looks a bit weird.
I'm going to go ahead and move along.
Hollow Men verse five.
I've never heard of that before,
but I know Marlon Brando.
Yeah.
He's the one from movies.
Rags needs to be put on ignorekins.
Yeah, well, I don't agree.
He's religious, so he has no four skids.
Well, his parents were religious,
so he has no four skids.
Let's be clear.
It wasn't up to him.
You should.
Oh, I'm.
Hey, Mola, I know it's far overdue,
but congrats on breaking two million views
on your Fallout 76 video.
Why thank you.
Yeah, good job, Marlon.
Worked very hard on that one.
It must have been a fucking slog
and a pain to play that much of it.
Oh, yes.
It's one of them not good games.
I don't know if you've ever heard of those ones.
I have heard of them.
Yeah, but that's the games.
Yeah.
Yes, that's another name.
You should invite Nick Rakita on at some point.
He said he's interested.
And yeah, that's definitely in the works.
The only thing we'll be figuring out
what video to cover.
And then Thorius Unlimited.
At least for the final two episodes of Batwoman.
Kiss Jay.
Maybe we should have some kind of Batwoman effect
at some point.
I've mentioned them.
He does a Batwoman episode talk chat bots.
But we're way even.
Robot Chicken was more respectful to the OT.
Hell yeah, Robot Chicken is celebrating the OT
when it makes this stuff.
I don't know, competition.
The fontism is some grade A mind goblins.
That's not a detail.
Because he doesn't care about those.
Mind goblins?
Last stream, my super chat calls the discussion
about sandwiches.
And all I want to say is that some sandwiches
do have beans in them.
For example, tortas.
Sure.
Yeah, I believe a sandwich can have beans in it.
I agree with that.
I stand for that.
That would be in my policies if I was to run for president.
You stand for bean sandwiches.
I stand for the existence of sandwiches
that have beans in them.
Whether or not I would like to have them
or enjoy them is irrelevant.
All sandwiches, beans or otherwise.
Jay Longbone and Efap again.
You guys should hunt down a Batwoman fan
to cover together sometime.
Oh, I get it.
I would be so interested in just being like,
what are you smoking?
All the fans are bots.
I think all the fans are bots.
Have you seen this?
They're not even real.
Have you seen their subreddit?
They're like, yeah, this is actually not only good shit,
but the best CW is done.
It's like, oh, man.
I mean, I could believe it's the best they've done.
I mean, yeah, after Infinity Tism, it's like, okay.
All right.
You guys need to-
No, this is better, man.
Those are mean.
The Batwoman is absolutely better
than infinite crisis on many Earths.
The woof.
So good job, Batwoman.
You know what?
Wouldn't it be great if Batwoman turned out
like by season three, we felt good?
Like we were all actually like, oh, man.
I'd love it.
It'd be so great.
Batwoman's in jail for all of her crimes
against humanity and gross negligence.
She's, you know, meaning out justice.
And instead, we get a cool superhero
who's actually good and virtuous
and interesting that I care about.
I just want to see Batwoman
get hit by more trucks.
Yes.
Oh, it's so wonderful.
That was a gift.
I want to see C-I-G-A-T-A-T-A-T-A-M.
Yeah, that was.
We'd already been given so much that episode.
And then they were like, you know what?
Here you go, guys.
And we're like, oh, that's really kind.
You guys have been so good to us.
You've been so nice.
So kind.
Here you go.
Porkin scored a gig at the stage play about pirates.
His role is Jim Hawkins.
Get get it.
Yeah, I get it.
Oh, don't forget about the Diznoids.
Hello Greedo should be wearing a Mickey Mouse mask
at this point.
The Disney Wars trash fanfic is as soulless as it gets.
I mean, maybe he should upgrade to a Disney hat, you know?
Disney helmet.
He'll suit him.
The Coof's going to get you.
Stay safe, my Massives.
Oh, we shall.
We shall.
Sam, before I go, said Mr. Frodo,
there's something I need you to know.
He got on his knees to give him a blow.
Sam let out a loud oh, thank you, Brodo faggons.
That was someone paid money to help me read that.
Thank you, Mr. Brodo.
Mr. Brodo faggons.
No homo, Mr. Brodo.
I put my phone in my breast pocket to listen to music books.
If at work close enough to my face for me to hear
because headphones are absolutely banned.
Oh, I'd be curious if it was a safety thing
to not have headphones while simultaneously allowed
to listen to like a music thing.
It'd be interesting.
You'd think they would just outright ban it all.
T.A.J. wasn't the risky one.
It raises concepts that existed in Star Wars for years.
The catastrophic fails to develop them.
And there's an argument that every action seen in the film
counts as a soulless homage or callback.
That's what I mean.
It's a whole interesting argument
to go over what exactly it means to have
a safe or risky Star Wars film.
I'd be like, hmm.
I'm pretty sure that Stormtrooper said ghouls
doesn't make the scene any better.
I'm just saying.
What would that be referencing?
Ghouls.
Like Kylo Ren, like the Knights of Ren.
Knights of Ren.
Ghouls.
You see, here's the thing.
You see, here's the thing.
I don't I don't know if that makes more sense or less.
I was going to say, well, how could that make sense?
Well, what do you what would that even mean?
They are ghouls.
What does that mean?
How does one ghoul how does one reach ghoul status?
What is special about being a ghoul?
What what is different?
I would like a description of the attributes
that come with being a ghoul.
I need it.
Chance of Sardonicast crossover.
I doubt it, but I'm on board with such an idea.
Yeah, I'm fine with it.
It ain't it ain't our side saying no,
but I I don't know if they I don't know.
I don't know if they can handle our subject our object isms.
I don't know if they can handle our references.
I.J. kick rags.
Damn.
Ain't happening.
Nope.
Guardians of the Galaxy was a risky movie,
but it was still good.
Was it risky?
I really need a better understanding
of what people consider risky.
Because would you say like it's risky to have a raccoon
and a tree as main characters?
I just be like, I don't know.
Is it isn't that interesting on its own?
The fact that a raccoon and a tree are characters.
Yeah, I mean, how many I mean, then you think it's
is it risky to make another Terminator movie?
No, and yet and yet.
Not really, because the EU did the exact same thing.
I'm assuming this is responding to the idea
that it's not risky because the EU already did a thing.
I would say that you could have something risky
be done in a different medium,
and then it would be risky again in another medium.
You know, it's possible.
I just need to figure out better what exactly risky
and non-risky means.
It makes me upset that Hello Greedo
isn't wearing a Greedo mask.
He did once upon a time.
Yeah, I yeah.
Just got yeeted.
Just got yeeted off a 75 man double elimination tournament.
Oh, well, at least I made it to the top 34
and all of my sets were two to one best of three matches.
That's that's still that's top half.
And yeah, doing that pretty good considering.
Well, I actually watched one movie Bob video game over
thinker episode 27.
He refers to himself as obnoxiously intelligent.
That's probably the closest to self-awareness
we're ever going to get.
So but obnoxiously intelligent.
I wouldn't say that that's describes him.
I agree.
It doesn't.
He's not intelligent, but he's obnoxious.
All right.
He is obnoxious.
You'll get no argument for me on that.
A holiday special push the boundaries.
All right.
Yeah, that was risky.
Fix your Mike Southpaw.
That was from Southpaw.
What's better Jesus or a picture of Jesus?
The picture because you need only one nail to hang it.
Oh, that's offensive.
Poor Jesus.
He didn't want to be nailed.
You can't be saying that.
But it's true, though, in terms of efficiency.
Southpaw equals the big gay.
Hi, Jay Longmore Leore.
Also high rag.
Hello.
I finally caught Efab Live.
Mola, have you or any guest presence seen the 2014 film
The Grand Budapest Hotel?
If so, what are your opinions on it?
I bet Jay hasn't because he's an uncultured badman.
Yeah, I saw it.
I thought it was awesome.
But yeah, I heard it's really good.
Very visually pleasing.
It's like a Wes Anderson, so it kind of makes sense.
But just the each frame, you're just like, ooh.
Stuff's going on.
It's interesting.
Things to look at.
Yeah, it's a very superficial compliment,
but I would need to see it again.
So I'm pretty sure I saw it when it came out,
which means that was six years ago.
Oh, how time flees.
Glib equals double bigger.
They I weekend warrior.
I think Blessed Southpaw and Glib
are having a back and forth in Superchance.
Is Ocean Man objectively old?
Old is relative.
That's true.
Could someone call my gay next?
What do I do with that?
Can someone call my gay next?
Hm.
Meant double bigger gay.
Damn autocorrect.
Imagine being a Star Wars fan
that ignores all criticism from logical people
and just loves the brand
to the point of cult-like behavior.
Or imagine being Southpaw.
Damn.
They just they just they just
fighting each other throwing punches.
Imagine being so afraid of being mistaken for me
that you'd use Clint Eastwood as your avatar
instead of your real face.
Oof.
Imagine be Podcat.
Chris Stuckma.
Poor.
Wink face.
Or Miley face with a nose.
Also high rags because that's what you do.
Hello, hi hi.
Glib's mic should cut out more often
to break up his filibusters a little.
Oh!
They are firing firing shots
in those Superchance.
Does COVID-19 practice kung flu or Dai Chi?
Very clever.
I think it's both.
TLJ Luke is just discount Shifu
from kung fu panda.
Isn't Shifu like much more hopeful though?
Wait I thought I thought it was the
Shifu that I thought he's the turtle right?
Is is the turtle?
Oogway.
Oogway right.
Yeah I thought Shifu was the little rodent thing.
Yeah.
I don't even know.
But he's like cynical I guess.
Is that the comparison?
I guess.
But he ultimately does what he does the training
and he sticks to it and he's yeah he's doubtful
but he still does it and he does the right thing.
Efap26 at 40700 to 40710.
CJ is watching porn.
I doubt.
But do you want to go inspect that time stamp
while I carry on rags?
Just out of curiosity.
Say that one more time.
I will send it to you.
Just out of curiosity.
Detective rags is on the case.
Efap26.
And apparently Efap6 32700 is the first high rags.
Hello.
Yeah.
Efap26.
And then stop sending this three of them.
Someone said Efap12 50155.
Can't be can't be running around looking at time stamps.
What is this?
What is this?
Just finished Efap57.
Started back in October after a J video.
Stopped in to say hi everyone.
But rags.
Also hi rags.
Hello.
Say what?
They said hi to everybody but you.
But then also hi to you.
Hey well you gotta give me a second.
Let me take a look at this and see.
Mm hmm.
Jay you're like a human version of the 1916 rising.
I have no idea what that's supposed to mean.
What?
Stop sending these.
Got another one.
Yeah I have I have no idea what this person's referring.
Oh okay.
I have no idea what they.
I don't get.
Does does CJ make a noise or something?
I guess sort of but.
You know as well.
Hey Jay how about you self-aware dab and kick off.
He did.
I'm pretty sure he would have dabbed before leaving.
Someone said God not in my satanic server.
Oh you know sometimes they just slip in.
A little bit of God here and there.
Hello everyone hope you guys and gals are well.
Just three questions.
Is it possible for objectively good porn to exist?
Um yes.
Well the interesting thing about that would be that they're.
They would be filming it right and that will be coming with a bunch of.
Is that standards to apply.
I mean fuck I don't know about you guys but I like my porn to be in focus.
Like if it's so blurry it's kind of like.
If we if we get ourselves standards in a set of rules to.
Operate by then yes we can.
Whether you care about those rules is going to be up to you in that sense.
How can it be possible are there any examples yeah the amount.
Obviously that it'll give you sexual tisms is going to be the subjective part.
So yeah that's the subjective thing but we could treat it essentially like a movie because it is
a movie can have characters in writing and dialogue and other stuff maybe.
Yeah you could even get to the point where you're making some just straight up good
good TV that you also have ported it.
We've really taken this to the next level.
Yeah I have been shown furry comics that are not bad but.
They're furry porn comics there you go.
Of course he didn't think that Luke's character was botched his dumb philosophy
on creativity prevents him from thinking such things.
I mean he just.
Wait this is probably about Greedo actually it could be either of them
they both thought it was great so.
Never know.
Hey maula have you seen the toxic avenger and its multiple sequels great stuff.
I think they've been sarcastic with that one and no I haven't I've heard of toxic avenger though.
They're called jesus bows gay j gosh jesus bows what could that be in reference to what are we
talking about jesus bows jesus bows.
It's funny that these TLJ defenders act like the movie was so groundbreaking and they will ignore
how much that it rips off empire and return of the Jedi.
Well yeah it's it's weird that everyone always refers to TLJ as the one that was like the risk
taker the one that stands out from the crowd the reinvention it's like you do remember all the
shit in it that's taken from the other movies right I imagine they'd be like that's just
homage it's just reference yeah not like TFA where it there's a clone.
Luke tries to murder his nephew in his sleep this is the Jedi's fault.
No no he takes responsibility for it I'm sure he just thinks that it's because of Jedi the Jedi
training that he did it. Hi rag hi mauler hello hello jay that's all it says just says jay.
Weekend upload more videos well he did say uh a week's time or so should be getting one.
Luke blames toxic jedalinity for his consequences.
I could see how that that's what it seems to be yes thinks the Sith are just as bad.
You can hear the S's oh about about the ass thing. Remember when he said he bleeped out ass
ways this is still Greedo comments right? Thanks holds bleep. Yumlings the Sith's favorite beer.
Yeah why not I get it I get it like yin yinling but youngling yeah I uh I got you. Luke's philosophy
is like I know there's a rule that says thou shalt not kill but I almost killed someone so
the religion was always flawed. The lighthouse is a love letter to Aquaman. Yes yes it is.
I bet it's all cold and like clammy I don't even and who knows what smells going on there.
I think I'd be okay with the smell I don't know who knows what's going on there.
I think I'd be I think I'm okay with it just like if as long as it was like fish smells they have
they get bad rap but you can have a fish smell that's fine. I think it's the fact that it if
it's a fish it's probably like cold and on the inside you know that's just how it looks. I know
it looks cold it looks cold you know I want my moving on.
The real reason Anakin fell to the dark side he lacked discipline and had human intercourse
oh my god also high best doggo rags oh hello uh well maybe mauler if the maybe a Jurassic
Park sequel where they had a functioning park but repeat the same mistakes from the first movie uh
oh yeah they kind of did that this Luke changed over decades argument is a fallacy he made a
snap decision in defiance of his past then stayed like that for decades we didn't see enough of any
of it we don't know why he did what he did why but we don't know we're just operating people
speculate he did it because something that I feel you should have to speculate on this no
no we need to know exactly what the fuck was happening in that scene and why we need to see
like the many days before then it's like I'd seen it in moments in his training it's like seen what
what are you talking about like and then and then Leia in TFA was like Snoke had gotten to him
something's like what does that mean what was he like you know how the prequels like had lots
of conversations between Palpatine and Anakin remember that remember lol remember
afterwards Kylo walks up asks Luke does it hurt oh he asks Luke that
I feel like that's so many saves for for Rey but you know I don't know I don't know all the lore
Luke didn't stop Rey destroying the TIE fighter because Yoda didn't stop Luke being an autistic
child mida mida rough there you go oh that would have been so awkward if he was about to slice
down Kylo and Yoda shows up he goes no don't what are you doing looks like oh hey is this is this
a no-no he's like what the fuck man what what they just don't even speak they're just looking
at each other he's like oh shit I mean I'm pretty sure he's evil and Yoda's like
what do you mean you wouldn't get it you're a ghost yeah you wouldn't get it you've already
died what do you know about death uh I can imagine Obi-Wan and Anakin storming Luke when he reconnects
with the force screaming at him what the hell have you been doing you laser braid we've been
trying to reach you for ages I think they'd have a lot of words to share with him
um primarily being disappointment uh robot heads throne room fight versus PSA's reused red trooper
fight yeah it was making me think about that when I saw um Sitch's assessment of that thing that
that's crazy it was it was crazy yeah uh I guess because we could talk about that for a little bit
so PSA Sitch has a video talking about Trost and he goes in depth on the scene where Rey kills a
bunch of red guard dudes and holy shit that is a fucked up scene for a scene that I didn't even
care about when I first saw it so she's like she's just killing dudes whatever but he goes over it
in depth and explains all of the ways they fucked up filming it it's quite funny I y'all
seriously should go and watch his video it is uh oh something else they really were fucking lazy
when it comes to choreography across the sequel trilogy kind of amazing the fact that they used it
twice yeah the same they just tried to digitally make it I had no idea no fucking clue that shocked
me when he showed all the clips that's insane you know when he started to like reveal what he was
about I was like no they had to like CGI so many different things because the camera the actors
it's none of it was lighting up like a blaster shot is fired from behind her head and she directs
it to in front of her head to someone else it's like what the hell's happening um can you imagine
one look at that and they're just like oh wow flashy it's great bench bat shapiro's greatest
enemy is jokey oh yes it will battle eternally uh thanks for this needed effap isolation sucks
and y'all make it more bearable do more please on a less serious note what would it cost to get
molar to open up his twitter dm so i can slide in there um I don't know I try and catch you know
tweets in general you'll be fine not during quarantine yeah you can't be doing that you can't
be sliding into anything during quarantine accept your own series of rooms back and forth
oh look at that see 0221 is funny to me that guy thought it was funny that guy knows what's up
horizon zero dawn is coming to pc indeed indeed a runny yes
if you sat with red letter media to do a review what film do you choose
hmm can it be one they've already done um I don't know if they'd want to do it again
okay well we'll do two then so assuming they've already done it I would probably
choose predator I'd love to talk to him about that it's one of my favorites one they haven't done
um trying to think of something that they'd probably be interested in covering that I also
have just seen a lot of times one of the top I had to be like true lies I feel like that could
be fun to cover um maybe night before Christmas I know they have a vague interest in Tim Burton
because of Ed Wood um I wouldn't mind talking about something like alien three I don't think
they've done that yet just to go over its pros and cons what did they do all of the aliens I can't
remember man I don't know uh
would you interstellar with them oh no I don't want to have to deal with like having to explain
all of what I think is wrong with that film I would just look like an asshole I think
fucking hate that movie
um
oh yeah I saw that clip on twitter by the way you did you you said you removed the music
I removed the music from because it was funnier than I remembered it
it was from the sky trash scene yeah you buy sky and trash
oh Jesus Christ that movie's hilarious
jay said alien three is better than aliens and says aliens isn't a good movie jay can be wrong
we have one of those on wait wait he did yeah I'm having vague memories I watched their audio
or listened to their audio commentaries um jay has some fucking weird takes about aliens
and he's very wrong because aliens is like that's that shit's like top five of all time for movies
for me aliens is really tough alien three is not the alien three is the one that fucking destroys
everything and that alien resurrection is just this is lost its mind um but yeah I don't know
what have you got ranks anything um I'd be
legend yeah it's navy five uh Excalibur um maybe
quick in the dead yeah I could be cool especially being the uh
samurai me element I'm sure they'd have an interest let's see army of darkness
I would I think I might pick army of darkness I actually kind of love that from a filmmaking
perspective I think they'd really get a kick out of it and all the stuff that they do with the
stop-motion skeletons and the props and the sets and the it's campiness I I would I think I'll pick
that I think I'll pick army of darkness there you go uh Christmas is objectively better than
Halloween damn oh and it falls over Christmas is better and Christmas is better rag is right
Christmas is better than Halloween because hot chocolate is better than pumpkin spice anything
I don't even fucking drink pumpkin spice
my my halloween's a fucking custom these things pumpkin spice and Halloween don't even fucking
go together yeah pumpkin no I don't know pumpkin is and look I am a my favorite pie is pumpkin
uh but I just it's Christmas for me I gotta go with Christmas gotta go with my boy
hot witch is greater than hot Santa that is true does Santa visit orphans
well I'm a furry so I can say the reindeer so there you go does Santa visit orphans
who Santa uh I don't know depends on how much money the orphanage has
he has to he has to be paid like to go like I suppose if uh maybe you greased my palm a bit I
could find some time there's more and more people every year and his night's always the same so
he's like ho ho ho really jolly and then they like they he has the sack over and they had
him buddy and he goes oh that's not very much now is it that's I was I was I was sort of expecting
there might be a little more actually give me a couple more benjamin no we could discuss something
like I I thought you'd be more kind of Santa bringing me so much they had an extra five
dollars they're like that is literally all we have left he goes oh is that so I've got some
what do I have man what one of your nuns looking real good right
I'm so lonely I even take a ho ho ho maybe maybe Bethany over there would like to spend some time
with me at the back sir Bethany's 12 he's the pedophile not me
rags decided the story had to go somewhere else
he could just he could just be an asshole he can he can just take money from starving people or
whatever I hope you never write a choose your own story choose your own orphan oh god no
uh Halloween is better because hot swinger orgy's god
why you can do those at Christmas yeah I was gonna say orgies are Christmas Halloween
I mean if you want to have it to be Halloween themed but
um Halloween is better but I'm biased because it's my birthday my brother-in-law's birthday
on Christmas and he hates it Halloween is objectively better well that's a good proof
that's a good through line Christmas is objectively better especially as an adult
with money I can buy my own candy whenever I goddamn please but getting people to buy
me stuff is a rare treat oh sorry little person a little human child
that picture of R2 Wix after Rise of Skywalker I too felt I'd been shot with an electric blast
and knocked unconscious yes yes man kind of represents all of Star Wars that that picture
of R2 followed over yeah this is what it's come to boys Christmas is better because the idea of
forced slave labor of the knife eared expletives also known as elves tickles me in all the right
places oh my god Christmas spirit sure rags didn't send that shit yeah
I like troll them on sounds like leaven based Digimon uses car batteries to power up his
lightning attacks obviously your massives have a great stream and also high rags hello quick
question thoughts on the Witcher games uh I've played the second one and I love it I've played
the third one I've played none of them I'm a bad man oh my god you have a JF video games
Intel QTAL laughs in total yeah even total got intellectual right I think
yeah man total total is not an idiot tunnel is a is a verified smartman is this supposed
to be into like util I don't think it's supposed to be it's like you told oh that is a that's a
fucking thing oh never forgetting oh they're asking is it supposed to be intellectual uh
but like I I'm guessing it's before we would have clarified that that's what it was I don't know
um hey boys thoughts on the tragedy of Christopher Christian Christine
Western Chandler the true and honest creator of Sonichu
oh that's Chris Chan I guess yeah I don't know enough about it I'd have to read up on my
internet lore um and will you guys ever cover Tony Goldmark's video on the Last Jedi
possible I don't know who that is though
um check out star wars theories videos on truss you massives
again possible into future who knows
this man is an intellect util powerhouse yes sir
yeah
intellect util was typed on purpose he did not want to confuse anyone into thinking that what
he was doing is intellectual I see is your intellect util just self-aware cringe mauler
I do mauler is showing some typical bull queer behavior
yeah
jay review steven universe finale it's terrible shalom rags
um I think I can't remember if he said he is doing that or not but uh I don't know it's hard for me
to keep track of steven universe whether or not he's actually done a video on it or not yet
I'm assuming not and whether or not he wants to um it's called a clapper because the clap syncs
audio and video yeah I know it claps I know it's it's called yeah the claps that's why it's called
a clapper it's got a big clappy thing syncs audio and video right yeah just he's just trying to
give you a helpful bit of trivia slap slap slap clap slap and clap slap and clap rags help I
inhaled my grandfather's experimental internet gas and now I can't stop saying the n-word stay safe
out there my n-words oh marvel I wish they're just like fuck it he can't stop saying the n-word
efap puts the cute in interlocutile oh evil voice destroy the child corrupt them all so
good old-fashioned alex jones quote I think we'll uh we'll be seeing more of alex jones videos with
the new doom game coming out hopefully get some get some new quotes lizard people ones gay frogs
etc have either of you seen the greyhound trailer there's something I would consider tismy between 202
and 212 hmm the greyhound trailer that's not some some other disposable world war two tom hanks
wankfists I don't know oh that one um give me a sec curious if I can spot whatever they're talking
about 202 um oh it looks like it's there's like a print of a wolf on this submarine maybe that's
what they're referencing something tismy I see uh at least vader wanted to connect with his son
well you know Han did too until he killed him so it's like the same you guys just don't understand
that star wars is muka shaka paka all right correct I agree hey mutually did you ever watch
the youtube channel prepare to try three english chaps one hardcore welsh plays souls games for
the first time sounds like it could be fun especially with the hardcore welsh but I know
I've never never seen or heard of no do y'alls know the channel griffin gaming yes I think I
know of it I do not all right don't worry about corona america will be open for business by
easter despite what so-called experts say sacrifice granny to the market gods oh
what if granny is the market god everything about that jay just hurt my ears thanks he didn't even
apologize to chat I did tell him ah child murder the most heroic of acts I mean it can be if it
was like you know like uh uh devil child that's gonna usher in the apocalypse sacrifice the child
see yeah rags knows what's up uh movie bob u frick is the most fricks movie bob will get wait
why didn't he like joker it was made for him oh I get it I get it
it movie bob do you remember when movie bob was like nobody's gonna be talking about joker
a week from after it releases and then people wouldn't stop talking about it yeah then it won
those awards poor movie um hello boys mesa back oh Jar Jar was a fan of uh evap which is cool fun
fact in a comic Jar Jar's dad has a gun to his head when his mother when his mother to think
about his child he pulled the trigger you got to read the comic what
and when his mother to think about his child he pulled the trigger
apparently it's a Jar Jar comic where his dad has a gun to someone's head I I don't know what's
going on there but sounds like it could be good law this is what I mean like building him up to
be the bounty hunter I still think that's the best course of action just saying hi rags hello
I live alone and poop with the door closed stay strong brother stay strong united they
did it they actually ruined Jar Jar Binks don't underestimate disney they will rip your spleen
out through your throat and they will laugh along the way yeah she was a palpatine he was
a skywalker a tale as old as time it's not like it's not just thinking what they would like
want people to think they were going for
you see at the end a skywalker and a palpatine kissed because it starred out that they hate
each other what a story for fucks sake youtube didn't let me at all you guys were live
jumping into four hours late only knew you guys were live because maul's icon had the live symbol
by it oh no oh no by it right there maul a subjectivity slayer needs more victims now
objectivity slayer I think that's what uh e-man gaming's video uh meme video is
called we really we will get around to recording those I swear all fear the long neck man fire he
sees all and hears all longbow mangans mangans that's a really awful surname isn't it
mangans yeah oh a mange any interest in unique nameasaurus sequel trilogy rewrite long and a bit
of a ramble but perhaps with a discussion tries to preserve all key aspects of the plot but make
them good also high regs hello um we probably wouldn't want to check that out it would just
be the same as like why how many fictions would we want to try out you know just like yeah we'll be
right we kind of like suggest stuff along the way sometimes with um talking about different
scenes and stuff I'm curious how he spelt it in his script you assume he had a script doggo
he might have I mean you you think he came by that shit naturally
yeah I think he had a script because I don't think he I don't think well I think he did I
think he he was reading that from a script yeah uh hello if up crew just wanted to thank you for
everything including inspiring me to create my first breakdown video if possible I'd like
some feedback for the quality of my video if not that's understandable and thank you um good to
here uh we don't tend to do that because I think if we did we would uh end up with a significant
amount of requests for it and then we'd have to pick and choose and I don't want to be doing that
it would just be it would be but uh yeah good news I hope uh I hope you pursue your interests
in analyticalness that's a word what is your opinion on the original Muppet movies the ones
from the 80s I think they still hold up as good comedies but just wanted to hear from y'all thanks
for keeping my sanity up minus Bob minus Bob I only remember them being good but I'd have to
re-watch them yeah the Muppet movies you guys remember much of anything about them
um watch like a Muppet treasure island and the one where Muppets in space
I'm assuming the Christmas Carol one counts as well right oh yeah the Christmas Carol one yeah
yeah that was some good shit good rat
for the next kadab sponsor raid shadow legends there may be a reference maybe
given how often youtube demonetizes videos taking sponsorships like raid shadow legends is the only
way a lot of youtubers can make money very true I mean we we poke we poke fun at them just in a
light-hearted way at least I do I don't I don't begrudge anybody I have a level of begrudging
it really depends on what your channel is and what you espouse your values to be for example
if you're reviewing video games and you you directly like advocate for never supporting
you know any practices that are bad or any elements like loot boxes microtransactions
all that sort of thing and then you simultaneously like but I gotta bring in the money so play this
game that goes against all my values I'd be like wow and when they do the whole like uh play with
me on it I love this game I play it all of the time and you're like do you yeah or are you saying
this because they gave you dollar bills because and you know because that is a willed away from
saying something like oh this you know gaming chair is well built and um I only said I would
promote it if I had a free version to be able to test out you know that sort of thing
this fucking rage shadow yeah I lost my faith in any kind of rage shadow legends like people
say it's a good game when when they started to shill the whole if you sign up now you can skip
the initial set of levels for leveling I was just like oh god this is my favorite part
given oh wait efap quote without context for the day what a great duck thanks dad
drunk rags that you in duck isn't supposed to be and I stupid super chat rules
all right
also eight episodes into Buffy has sometimes feel bad for Xander getting so friend-zoned but then
he reminds me why he's there soon after uh also hi rags hello season one is rough good luck
is I am all the Sith referencing I am the senate
I am the Sith that would be so funny she oh I'm sorry she said I am all the Jedi first
and his response was I am the senate I am the senate like what I'm sorry that's slipping from
the top I'm just so used to I had a moment back glory days why is that relevant he's like I don't
know I kind of wish I kind of want to have a senate again just uh weekend sounds like cricket
from always sunny well there you go finds new problems with the last Jedi reminder defenders
of this garbage say in a few years we're all gonna start revering this movie like with the OT yep
they think that once we hit 2025 we'll be like you know what TLJ masterpiece masterpiece
because in that amount of time what makes sense will have changed we won't you know
we will have changed our understanding of of cause and effect
Reylo makes less sense than Zutara a high bar that's uh Zuko and Katara I believe
which is worse Abrams Trek or Abrams Wars you're asking the wrong person because I would just say
Abrams Wars but I would I would by default because I don't know much about Abrams Trek
but it would be interesting to see someone who's a big fan of both decide it for sure I have a
feeling most people would go with Abram Wars I feel like it did more damage to Star Wars than
the Trek ones did even from my limited knowledge but I could be wrong yeah I feel like they just
sort of went out with a whimper well the the the Trek ones well the wars ones because they both
there's a blig of waterway ow
okay um after hearing all of the misused words it is easy to understand why the main page says
interlocutant yes so I'm drunk and officially laid off and the more I play eternal the more I long
for the simple perfection of 2016 bit torn because I like eternal a lot but I feel like I'm getting a
lot thrown at me yeah I want to play it so I can actually like talk about it because I know a lot
of people have been saying interesting things about eternal and I'd be curious to uh to join
in I I completed will of the wisps to like faultisms I recommend especially if you like the first
Ori um but as a buggy as fuck unfortunately I experienced I would say a good near 10 game
breaking bugs and what I'm referring to stuff like I would be drowning on dry land falling
through the floor um I became invincible randomly in one of the boss fights which is really annoying
so I was trying to find a way to kill myself so that I wouldn't win which is a very bizarre
circumstance to be in for a video game um but that was but but fun fun fun tisms I just hope
they iron out the bits and bobs that are clearly uh flumpy can we make an executive decision and
drop this guy oh we we made it through we got through the whole thing uh if they have to kiss
for your audience to know they're an item then you've done something wrong as a writer sadly
this is far from unique to JJ I mean none of us fucking saw it covered right I was just like oh
this video is so interlocutal meaning trying to be an intellectual but fails completely and
causes the loss of brain cells oh there you go that's interlocutal defined
oh yeah and another uh metal killed the boss of will of the wisps that reset him on the entire
boss which is not what it's supposed to do anyway like it's supposed to reset you into phases but
you got reset the whole thing and had to just beat it again it was uh it was quite funny
lots of bugs in that game that are really weird and fuck with you quite a bit unfortunately
but some people have gone through without any bugs so you know it's a bit of a luck factor I
guess the final shots of troughs make the sons look like bb8 and I hate it passionately
passionately um I mean they're separated you might be you might be seeing bb8s where there
are no bb8s but uh you know it's the binary sunset that means it's good it rhymes and if you disagree
you're wrong because rhyming is good yeah so I had the pleasure of showing my GF fellowship
this past weekend and of course she loved it otherwise she wouldn't be alive anymore
it really gets it never gets old seeing new reactions to lord of the rings yeah man
god loves watching it is great good stuff man return of the king video game is a lot of fun
I remember liking it I also remember having problems with it I'd have to replay it to know
for sure but uh I also remember telling wolf about the I think you didn't know about this as
well but the the double mithril fire arrows from lego less once you get the final upgrades you just
fucking annihilate orcs each age mithril is where the whole cost of the yeah he's fiery shy as a
people uh what do you what do you plan to cover the beam videos I made a few of them would be nice
to see reactions to them yep gonna sort that out soon but um you know how it is with not only
getting it done but also sorting out all of the uh the claims that'll hit it hopefully it can stay
up we'll uh but we'll try and get that sorted I've got them all in a big uh notepad ready for links
oh you're back let me uh can you take on Netflix's death note that's a possibility I've said it
because it's a one season so me and rags could theoretically watch that and then we could watch
the movie and then as a big old blizzard we could we could have like we could cover a video that's
positive about it and have er as a guest because he enjoys watching animu from what I understand
that big weeb um rags palpatine said forced dyads were unseen for generations kylo and ray
weren't the first they were just the first in a long time uh they weren't even it does it seems
as if they're not even the wiki says the first time they're even mentioned is in um
hang on you'd think that would be in a book somewhere because the jedi were around for
thousands of generations thousands and thousands of years yes
they're he they're just they just gave them that line so that they could be like
yeah this definitely isn't something we do oh yeah they just i'm picturing this
writing it they're like wait why has no one found about this before it's like just say
that it's been gone for ages okay a long time it's been a long time bills how have you been
hey fellas sans is in smash guy here i just finished a month-long fight against a five
millimeter kidney stone and i wanted to say you guys my favorite podcast and certainly
distracted me from the agony thank you for being you my goodness uh i'm glad you've passed
it and hopefully you are being entertained in rough times like that that sucks kidney stones
are the big gay thoughts on the final fantasy seven remake demo any any any any of us yeah
i'm afraid we yeah i don't know anything about the final fantasy haven't played it
oh sorry i hope it's good glad to see jay longbone got her alarm clock
i know i was i was late to my own stream a couple days ago i saw you tweet about it
yeah like an hour and a half
my body just didn't want to get up but i yeah i eventually got it together
it's this color time i'm glad you guys are okay i'd be lost without efap lovey mauler open your
dms oh it's the same person uh hi rags hello and jay longbone your laugh is perfection thank you
interesting efap easter egg i learned this week the music from the really cute farewell video
uh for wolf in efap 65 was the same music mauler used at the start of his 50k q&a video
huh
i don't even remember having music at the beginning of my q&a video but all right
that is a pretty big kwinky dink unless the person was referencing that music but um yeah
also hi rags hello no mention of fuel in uh revenge of the sith really wondering why
no mention of fuel they want you to think about the logistics as little as possible
in navy basic training stools in the barracks they don't have doors no recruits sneaking a fap
or trying to nap with no door we'd have poop talks all the stools face each other so we got
to have some real personal time great times hi rags hello well it's a civy life for me then
i couldn't maybe hold up um you know like a newspaper
ate dinner played several rounds of uno won a two-hour long game of monopoly because i was
the banker and you guys are still going love the long man yes we are how long have we been going
for well um a almost nine hours i think almost eight hours oh almost eight by the way i was
absolutely convinced you guys were going to be watching the ralph back ski bash back ski
is that how you pronounce that back she uh lord of the rings movies also lol also hi rags hello
nama we're going for the for the jackson ones the pitaya jackson
efap more often for those of us in quarantine please well it should be once a week and plus
a bonus thing uh each week that's that's hopefully going to be what we can uh
get going in some regular thing as well you had the three lord the rings things you must have
must be able to make use of that and of course you know i'm not saying you have to but i mean
if you guys are in quarantine you really like efap you could give it the old rewatcheroo if you
really want to um visit some of them altisms well the god part of jesus wanted to be nailed
play the timestamps from the earlier superchats damn it i'd say i don't want to we're getting more
and more of those i'm i'm gonna try to avoid them from now on because i don't want to be
trapped with playing timestamps together again uh do more efaps because of quarantine also rags
is gay lord lord of gay also rags is best guest the game for mola when's your next video i need
this like a crackhead needs crack two are coming from mooper in just oh on wednesday how about that
um mooper's worked pretty hard on both of them should have some fun i think i'm literally
gonna make them both public at the same time like i don't see any reason not to and uh hopefully
you have some fun with them uh other than that though my my main one gonna need another month
i think at the least don't like to promise any times but it's gonna take a while this one's a
biggan hey jay long bones say the n-word do it for wolf oh uh nightingale i think that's it
it was nacho yeah nacho trail hey mola what do you think if disney rebooted the alien franchise
oh i'm sure it'd be great i'm sure they'd nail it i'm sure that alien and aliens would be put to
shame by the miracle that is disney they've got a proven track record oh yeah sequel trilogy is
just avril lavigne's song skater boy in space changed my mind wait what is it because of the
whole he was a skywalker he was a thing that i don't know so goodfellas parasite and hateful
eight i very much enjoyed hate and goodfellas i didn't really like parasite that much you guys
like it don't you can you explain why maybe i missed something i don't like it um i thought
that the idea of them slowly trying to take the household through different professions was cool
i thought a lot of their ideas on how to do it made a lot of sense i thought that um i mean
you know we meme about themes but i liked the consistent ideas about the differences between
classes and their approaches to problems as well as living throughout the film was pretty strong
um i liked a lot of the the the camerawork the acting was strong i wasn't a fan of there's some
contrivances in the movie a little little here and there but the story they're trying to enable
through them is pretty strong as far as i'm concerned and the reveal of the thing is going
on in that house uh i still remember me and rags being like what the fuck is going on
uh it was pretty interesting it's if they had worse actors then the movie really wouldn't
nearly as good it's really carried by really good performances
and how convincing it is to the audience i think i said the credibility of how they get away
and how they do it it's really really convincing
um
what's your opinion on the 2004 reboot of Battlestar Galactica it's surprisingly about
character struggles and politics in the survivor's fleet i've not seen it parents used to watch it and
they uh said it was good but i never really saw it myself i think my dad liked it actually if that
is what i think it is there's another one with a girl on the box there's like a red dress blonde
hair i can't remember i could be close i could also not you even had some faith in rage for members
of the intellectual gaming community such as myself the default position is that all mobile
games suck except RuneScape but it's technically not a mobile game there is some mobile games that
are okay you can find them there's some there's some fun ones out there they're like little brain
teasers puzzley games and stuff um and then some other ones were a little bit more complicated
i remember there being some good flash games back in the day so there's got to be some good mobile
games yeah i arrived i remember boxhead do you remember that zombie killing game boxhead no
they made like loads of demonic defense was the one i played as well over the last stand do you
ever play that i i i might have that one kind of sounds familiar i'm curious to you in chat if
anyone had anyone's ears picked up from boxhead or the last stand we'll see uh i arrived late
because of youtube's bad alert system and missed half of tonight's efap can't wait to rewatch
everything i missed never change long man also high rags please take jay's milk away he will be
demilked demilked and kicked can you recommend a video game for my girlfriend that is beautiful
foresty and explorory but not too bashy oh i was about to mention the witcher 3 um i was gonna
mention forget ory beautiful foresty and explorory but it's a bit bashy so beautiful foresty and
explorory how about some um let me actually take a quick look here
let's see um journey good work yes seven days to die is not beautiful but it's foresty and very
exploring flower flower's probably the perfect game for that requirement set i would say but
that's an exclusive to ps3 and 4 i think looking here i'm saying fire watch that could work
seriously though flower sounds like one to one the best game for you looking for
i think the same people who made flower made journey right it's like i want to say i don't
remember what company it is but i think they were the same people
animal crossing that could work yeah animal crossing is a good one uh the elder scrolls
for oblivion that one doesn't necessarily have to be difficult at all same thing with sky rim
it doesn't have to be those are bashy yeah they are um abzu that could work far cry five
but that's kind of shooty any zelda game that could also work yeah the forest but that's more
horror survival uh
uh just scrolling through my list here
let me i'm trying to see if any you know the ones that fit the proverbial bill
foresty exploring but no bashy but no bashy
oh it says not too bashy not too bashy
looking looking looking yes i am a plague tail innocence might be something that you would
consider i i don't know about that you don't beautiful foresty not too bashy i feel like
not too bad yeah the bashy's weird though because it's not really a combat game it's more stealthy
we have to take not too bashy very seriously i guess um how about
risk of rain to what tetris yeah it's tetris uh i'm almost at the end of my list seeing if things
fit oh working close to stardew valley minecraft yeah that could work um let's see i mean there's
probably that's that's like 15 suggestions so it's gonna be something that they could work with
so yeah i'm i'm at the double use now uh stay frosty stay intellectual oh interlocutile
interlocutor
since ra doesn't show up a lot i take it upon myself to become the next rooftop
god hail ashen and the legion of ra is still open for recruiting oh i mean ra said he came
back last time right he was he was around he's he's he's licking somewhere i think yeah um feel
no obligation to do this but on efap 77 9 17 25 at 25 point 25 speed it's absolutely
fucking insane the gap between two and billion is almost an entire this says an entire it's like
transcending space and time as i'm typing this you just said no more time stamps now i'm sad mill
oh an entire minute yeah that makes sense the tunnel would take that long at that point
sorry about the sad milk
when this virus blows over you think some entertaining entertainment giants will
realize they literally can't afford crap writing no crap right will be around forever i think yeah
because people allow they they pay for crap writing and they either don't care even worse
they make excuses for it another thing about hiring writers it's about did they did what they
wrote and make money it's not was they right and good a lot of the time it just does yeah
that's just how it is it'd be like that tfa made a lot of money a lot of money
an efap long while i spend a lone time avoiding child support what's your opinion of hereditary
and the new grudge i thought they were both mediocre himself i think i was with myself i
liked hereditary i thought it was spooky but it's weird i know a lot of people didn't like
the ending i was okay with it i haven't uh seen either of them no it's just not a more
horror movie guy i have not seen the new grudge no
um
i like horror movies is spooky
okay dokey
okay uh is it look c or look c uh i'm guessing look c like two separate words not look sie
i've never actually checked that myself though what are the contents of your dream house
uh
anyone 14 werewolves what why would what why would you want 14 werewolves in your dream house
um let's see well what would i have i i don't know it probably wouldn't be very big
um i don't want a lot of space it'd probably be cozy comfy uh yeah i'm very utility focused
just be like as long as i've got everything i needed it that is comfy yeah i'd like it to
be kind of not a lot of big open spaces um something that's smallish i'm not a big size
queen when it comes to living space i don't know wood floors and rug something really
would you have a fireplace i would yes absolutely i would undoubtedly i would something that's
almost castle like but whoa quaint and modern you know like stone and wood paneling and
like fluffy rugs and a wood like wood beams um uh let's see something uh maybe a little porch
outside that there's something or maybe it would be like oh it would probably be like a hobbit hole
you know where it's kind of built into the where it's kind of built into the side of the hill
and it's just comfy and cozy and sweet and intimate and sexual is what you're saying yes
i mean i don't i don't know if i i don't want to i don't know what a sexual house would be
you just blurted out hobbit hole and i thought we thought you were gonna go to the worst
hobbit hole i made a hobbit hole joke right off the bat of the fellowship of the ring yeah
but um something like that you know not something gody or super opulent simple but nice cozy
warm um rags look behind you
all right
the command from super chats what could you do all right i i i did also what are you guys
critique on doctor sleep i'm using it as my first video i need to know i'm not the only
oh i need to know if i'm the only one thinking it's absolutely terrible uh wolf was very critical of
it i haven't seen it i don't have a huge desire to see it um and i don't think rags has seen it so
we're dry on that uh particular topic i'm afraid but good luck of course when Frodo gets stabbed
with a giant goblin in moria his rib cage and sternum should be in pieces right the mithril
is a vest with no rigidity he's taking a hell of a blunt force even with the vest like a sledgehammer
to a bulletproof vest i mean it like almost knocks him out doesn't it doesn't it go as well
is there an argument to be made that it's um slipping between his arm and chest once it's hit
the mithril if you know what i mean like as it goes in um i'd have to watch it specifically
again because the way he falls over looks like he's in pain from uh the force of the hit but
not dead is the point right yeah no you could be right that it should have done a decent chunk of
damage to him i would just have to look at specifically where the the weapon hits and
if there's room to assume that the it could have slid off a little to the gap between his chest and
his arm um on third playthrough of doom eternal while listening the game is so much fun only
minor issues are purple sludge and underwater sections but they're like one percent of the
game time love the parkour and new combat loop dash flames soar but can see why some won't
um halfway through doom eternal on nightmare difficulty just beat the first marauder boss
feeling pretty god tier rip and tear my brothers rip and tear until it's done
i think that bullshit is starting to quickly become the new the cake is a lie for me
oh rip and tear yeah rip and tear it's certainly not as good as slice and dice is it
no not nearly as good i'm just like hearing it over and over and over and over uh gedel
is my favorite part of april even more so than my own birthday super excited to see what mupa
worked up also hi ragus hello um i'm glad you're excited for gedel it is on the way
just a couple days now and mupa is excited to share um interlocutal musings with you all
we are the interlocutals
uh well if anyone in the brood wants it's a really a trip gather the lube and engage maximum
over slownald that was in reference to the uh slowing down the slowed down slowed down
slowed down slownald lube and slownald slube how do you get my hand out of a jar filled with pee
how do you get my hand out of a jar filled with pee
well i assume you would just pull your hand out i just like the idea that you're like okay
i have questions already why did i stick my hand in this jar full of pee
why is there a jar full of pee why have i placed myself in this position i knew where this would lead
um also please disintegrate false roof guard yeah no nobody's gonna want a replacement roof
guard i was gonna be very upset at the prospect uh please read an epic narrator voice um against
all the tisms that subjectivity can conjure all of the hypocrisy that the dysnoids can produce
we will send unto them only you rip fap a tear until it is done if you're if there's ripping
and tearing while you're fapping i i don't know you fucked up somewhere maybe they're referring
to like you ripping and tearing them fapping yourself you know it could could work you should
be very careful and then also question your choices in life i guess i suppose it could
he has sent a clarification in my hand is stuck in the jar
i'm afraid it may be over it's the guy who's stuck in the pee jar he's saying it's his hand
we know but what can we do i know it's your hand i would just suggest the the way that a jar typically
to have the hole on the top which i assume that you um is how your hand got inside in the first
place i would reverse the motion that you use to penetrate the jar and then remove the uh the hand
and just pull it out and it should come you know just just right out just flow open
blow out gush out would you say gush i mean i hope you can escape that unfortunately we just
had another one in that says i tried to disprove it now my hand's stuck as well oh my goodness
sorry guys have you considered like maybe unballing your fist if it is or is it holding
onto something maybe you have to get rid of that thumb you know just just lob it off say goodbye
well slip that hand out oh smash the jar yeah smash that's what say the jar is full of piss
so make you make sure you do this like on top of a rug or take it outside maybe on your bed risk
corona to escape the pee yeah just smash just smash that jar nothing too violent just give it
a little little or put it in the sink and just give a little tap with uh the back of a knife
or something like that you sometimes you don't have to hit them too hard maybe a spoon or
something you can give a little crack there grease up your hands yeah i don't i don't think piss is
good lube i can't imagine no i don't i don't think so um rags if i asked you nicely to rip
and tear my freshly bleached starfish would you be annoyed oh i don't want to rip and tear those
kinds of body parts yeah i could add badly i tried lube and i cut the thumb no luck oh
i mean he still hasn't tried smashing the jar so
but the number one solution still still active and also you know just more lube after that too
just pile it right on and that by the way leads us to the end um oh my god before we go i would
probably like to say jay longbone do you want to do you want to tell them to go and subscribe to
you because they should oh yes please subscribe to me i'm lonely over there um shit oh what am i
doing oh yeah what am i doing um i'm so fucking um just out of it um oh yeah i'm gonna be doing
