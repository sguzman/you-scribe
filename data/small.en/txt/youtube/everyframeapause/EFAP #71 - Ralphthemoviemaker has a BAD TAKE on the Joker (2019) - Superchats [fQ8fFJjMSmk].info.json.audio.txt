My process is that I will make it all at once, like chronologically.
I won't finish the audio until I finish.
I won't finish the videos and visuals until I finish the audio.
But yeah, I mean, I recorded all the all the audio
and now I'm putting the visuals over it.
I'll make you a bad person.
When's it going to come out?
Sorry, when's it going to come out?
I hope it's come out some early February, I hope.
And are you going to put it on the channel that you're putting like your streams on
or a different channel?
No, I'm going to make a new channel just for those kinds of videos.
That sounds like a smart thing to do.
Yeah.
Probably just going to call it just metal or something, if that's going to work.
I don't know how YouTube actually is with user names or something.
I think you can have a username that already exists.
OK, that's that's easy, then.
We are back.
Oh, life.
Ah, dee ha ha.
Yes. What?
Mola, why did you let that happen?
Well, I don't control these things.
It was automatic.
Was that supposed to be Alfred?
Yes.
That was important noise.
I had to make it. I'm sorry.
I agree.
None of us like you as a result of saying that.
Right.
We're we're we're.
Oh, my God. What the fuck?
That scary sounds.
Yeah, so hopefully the intranet continues to work if I.
Do you know what intranet is actually a word?
Yes, God.
So it's always work if I.
That's not.
Wow, racist.
Oh, so I'm just going to have a vision that.
Oh, my God, that's loud.
Hey, turn up the car.
Oh, my God.
What is with DeNiro's face?
Please stop scaring me to make me sad.
I guess Robert DeNiro looks old.
I am how this whole movie.
He's good.
The movie around him is another film.
This really reminded me of once you were never really here.
It's a really dark film.
OK, sorry, I think I'm just pausing for the music, to be honest.
No, he's his audio.
Everything's unbalanced.
Audio wise, like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Well, I wish I could comment on this, but I haven't seen yet.
I probably watch it next week.
Mm hmm.
The way they were able to capture this grimy city and this disturbed
character's mental state.
Yeah, kind of like Joker, they really captured the city well
in terms of its elapidation and destruction and incivility,
as well as the mental state of the main character.
I agree, Ralph.
It was very effective.
I had bad rap.
Hit home way more for me.
I think Phillips took a lot from that film as well.
So let's say the whole ending is a dream.
All of these characters are just manifestations inside Arthur's head.
At the conclusion, in his deluded mind, he thinks he's a savior.
He's being held on the street.
And then they cut to him in the asylum.
This could easily just be because he killed his mother and not because
of anything else that happened.
Wow, how brilliant.
I can't believe I didn't get the movie.
Jesus Christ, so fucking good.
He could easily have been there.
So good.
It sounds like he had an argument with someone online and he made this.
Yeah, like a really long time.
It all seems to be stemming from some argument he made somewhere else.
And he's bitter.
Someone told him it was all a dream.
And he was like, fuck you, fuck you.
Something could have made you about this.
Wow. So clever.
What a boring narrative.
OK, so society beat him down.
So he hid in his refrigerator.
What happened?
Society beat him down.
So he hid in his refrigerator.
Third or fourth time he did this.
Like, oh, also, did you watch the movie?
Do you remember what he said?
Like, all I'm saying is it's not perfect.
It's like you say it a lot more than that.
There's other things are being said.
OK, this honest or a parody?
I guess it's up to us, which one it might be.
I hope it's a parody because that's honest.
But it's a bad parody, but it's still just like.
Because it's not.
Parodies should, you know, communicate with their content that they are.
Oh, shit, it's not like a fucking gunshot.
This would have killed Jade.
I was like, oh, well.
No, there was this chair doing loud noise.
I mean, someone killed rags.
You didn't see me complain about that, so you're fine.
Yeah, rags killed rags.
That's different.
Do you think he's asleep at the desk?
Probably. I think he might be.
We wake up during Superchance.
He beat him down.
So he hid in his refrigerator.
And imagine that he went on a talk show and killed the guy
and became a joker.
Hey, hey, come here.
Um.
What? It's OK.
It's OK.
Don't feed your dog cotton wool.
That's the idea.
Oh, boy, it's OK.
It's OK.
In conclusion, this is a land film for this.
We did it, guys.
We need a little bit of mediocre, superhero, overproduced, whatever.
In conclusion, this video is overproduced video essay,
but mediocre garbage, all these terrible things.
But I'm just saying it's not.
No, it's not perfect.
It's not perfect.
It's always saying, yeah, I don't hate a movie, but it's boring shit.
And Alfred.
So I don't know what to talk about.
I just had Alfred.
I wasn't sure that's Alfred.
I needed Alfred.
They did not provide Alfred.
This guy's supposed to be Alfred or what?
Rex drank a lot and passed out.
We've never let him go past three.
And I guess I forgot to stop him.
Gee, this iteration is the blending of Hollywood.
Remember when a cuckoo's nest won best picture?
Now it'll be between Joker, Ant-Man and the Wasp three.
Ah, you fucking idiot.
There's only been one Ant-Man.
Is he mad?
Is he actually mad?
I would describe that as ass mad.
Very ass mad.
This sounds like someone having a breakdown halfway through a speech.
Yes.
Hey, guys, Mooper here.
And I just saw the new Ralph the movie.
Mooper?
Oh, he's making fun of you.
Oh, God.
This is actually you.
Oh, God.
I'm cameoing in the movie.
Three.
Hey, guys, Mooper here.
And I just saw the new Ralph the movie maker on The Joker.
And I have to say, I'm very insulted by his opinion.
No, I'm not trying to be mean.
I mean, I like Ralph.
He makes a lot of good videos.
I wouldn't say I like you.
I mean, I don't I haven't seen a lot of you.
I'm sure you're a nice dude.
I just I don't know.
I don't I don't really know Ralph that well.
I don't know the three and Sonata cast.
I followed.
I hit everything in YMS a lot.
I didn't really know much about Ralph.
But we really have to look at his analysis and thoroughly break down
why he's just a terrible critic.
The moment I try to hurt his feelings, like if you zoom in on his face here,
if you zoom in, I just keep zooming in on his disgusting face.
So I'm not trying to hurt his feelings right now.
What's that good thing?
What?
I mean, it's a bad video.
You might be a good critic.
If just I don't know exactly what we did this whole time.
We just zoomed in on faith for six hours.
Guys, let's zoom in on his face.
Guys, look, though, Rags, make big fun of his face.
Quick. Make fun of his face.
Do it.
It just says it just has a picture joker on the car.
Oh, Rags, did you fall asleep at your desk?
No. I do. I I was silently observing and listening.
Oh, just how does it get?
Rags, Rags, check.
Check this bit out together.
Let's let's see.
Rags, you're going to love this.
It's it's got guys looping.
Wait, wait, let me let me rewind it a bit more.
Your Ant-Man on the Wasp.
Did you just say I'm on the Wasp?
It's just as 24 18.
Or 18 Rex is just connected from the from the no.
I'm really, you're reading, reading, rewrites, rewrites.
You see the right.
Ray, I remember we creased picture.
Now it is a wick and joker ant man on the Wasp.
Get ready for this.
Hey, guys, Mooper here.
And I just saw the new Ralph, the movie maker on the Joker and I have this.
Mooper, who's Mooper?
Well, a lot of people seem to think that it's supposed to be me.
Are you Mooper?
Mooper here.
I believe I am Mooper.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
I'm very insulted by his opinion.
No, I'm not trying to be mean.
I mean, I like Ralph.
He makes a lot of good videos, but we really have to look at his analysis
and thoroughly break down why he's just a terrible critic.
The moment I try to hurt his feelings, like if you zoom in on his face here,
if you zoom in, I just keep zooming in on his disgusting face.
I'm not trying to hurt his feelings right now.
I was going to call it a safe.
James Ward, I guess, couple people have said this is supposed to be referencing
the Jenny Nicholson one as if like I was thinking.
But like, what?
It reminds me of the Quinton parody, who was like,
but it's like, hey, Shirley Ralph isn't actually fucking stupid enough
to think that like what we've seen the video, man,
he thinks Mooper is stupid enough to do it.
I guess he is.
People say is Mooper is that supposed to be more
supposed to be out for that?
It's supposed to be awkward.
This person is actually smaller.
It's supposed to be more.
It's disgusting face.
I'm just going to call it a disgusting face.
I'm not sure I could be reading a rile for it, but it seems like
Ralph is just angry and he's not actually looking into the film
and exploring on a deeper level what the film is trying to say about society.
Sounds like a bunch of shit to me.
Angry and stupid.
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we've I don't know.
We may have said angry, but we may be saying better.
You come across as somebody who's very upset across as very bitter.
Yeah, he does turn across bitter at least bitter.
You have I wouldn't say you've missed the deep themes.
You've missed details that fucking screw with your ability.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
He cut out.
You cut out.
He went out of his way from scenes, things that would
like invalidate things he says.
It's like, oh, shit, I wrote it down on my script.
I can't rewrite it.
I'll just hear what I'll do.
I'll just cut out these parts of the film so that I'm correct.
It was deceptive.
They're the crazy ones.
At least I got a cameo and then I realized my reference is wrong
and then I have to cut the joke, even though it was a good joke.
I am Uber and I insult people's faces.
That is my brand.
I mean, I got targeted.
He's clearly talking about Efap through the racist doggo in there, too.
Come on. Yeah, I hate I hate Cubans.
Oh, my God.
You hate Cuban in a movie and it wasn't funny.
Have against Minecraft, sad and depressing.
Therefore, I feel like I'm an adult and I'm mature.
Look, I saw a film that won the Golden Lion,
even though it's fucking on pajamas.
Even though it's fucking on pajamas.
I'm so glad that Cora, the Jew, gave you money.
What did you say about cock?
I forgot that quote.
Oh, I've got that.
I wrote that down.
So Rags, you like fucks up the editing at one point.
Rags, you like fucks up the editing at one point.
He's saying something and then it combines like two words or whatever.
It just sounds like he says it doesn't have a vision that cock.
I didn't see any cock in Joker.
Yeah, I know. It's the secret shame.
This film wasn't brave enough to show us Joker's cock.
He has a cock.
But yeah, that's that's it.
Oh, yeah. Alfred.
These credits supposed to be Alfred.
Hey, Rocky, you want to come to bed?
There's a perfectly comfortable bed for you right here, Rocky.
OK, just stand by the doorway, then.
Good night.
I'm scared.
Love.
Help.
Jane's playing games.
No, this is this just.
No, that wasn't a game noise.
That was just a noise photograph.
Help.
Um, oh, like.
This is good music.
Hmm.
Copy, right.
There you go.
You did it.
Well, that was it.
That was what I oh, no, no, I can't believe it.
And we are finished now. Fantastic.
That was something else made it through rags.
What you're awake for the bit about 4chan?
Yeah, where they found that comment from 2017.
I want to know if you could name search yourself on 4chan.
So I found that you can.
And then I found this person who doesn't like either of us.
I would rather not hear it, honestly.
Wow. I'll hear it.
Oh, my God.
Molar, it's a thread about you.
Do you want to read that out?
Rags, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I like.
OK, to clarify.
I really think he's dragged down
by the retarded company he keeps rags and JXC specific.
You know, I'm dragged down by those two.
Hey, that's an interesting take.
I haven't heard that one before.
There you go.
These are brainlets.
You think that because they can cobble together
two hours of drivel on Aquaman in a video editor.
Qualified, if you ever made a video about Aquaman.
Never. Nice to fly.
I think that the thinking of a wall.
Oh, my God. What the fuck?
It's 746.
I guess I had a timer for 746.
All right. What do you have to remember?
I can't remember waking up again.
It's my fucking kiss to me, too.
I have a timer to remind me of something that I can't remember what was.
OK.
Just because they can cobble together two hours of drivel on Aquaman
in a video editor, qualified to comment on film at large.
The most I ever granted myself on that tier of shilling
for a consequence of bullshit was trolling my way through an essay
for a mimetics class in college by writing
a couple of pages about Bain posting.
I don't know if that is including the stuff about the actual plane crash
in Baines, as well as the porn parody.
Just to see if I can get an A.
I did. I also got a citation.
This was a joke to me.
On the other hand, people like Rags and JXC
for all their guffawing about dicks and cummies and daddies and assholes
actually take themselves seriously.
You're right. You can't take yourself seriously.
You've made a joke about dicks and cummies.
Dicks and cummies are some some I don't know where they've got
the impression that I take my.
Yes, this is me taking myself.
This stream is me at my seriousness test.
I see. I knew that.
I knew that when I was just just being here.
I was like, this is the most serious Rags has ever been.
My shoes go.
You see, my shoes go.
Got his little doggo booties.
I read my most serious.
Where are my shoes go?
I'm at the bottom of the desk.
Like it's going to be like.
God, I'm dying to go.
Oh, just go this way.
So I guess that does it.
Anyone got closing thoughts on Ralph, the movie maker?
He should make better videos in the future.
So it's my advice.
We use it. We use it.
Salting his face.
I heard he normally does like pretty solid videos.
But this one was very bad.
And this one was terrible, was terribly edited.
And what do you have to say if it was all a joke and you've been tricked?
Well, good on him.
Congratulations.
It was a terrible parody and you should be ashamed of yourself.
I was going to say, I just made a video that's bad on purpose.
I would just straight face be like, your video is still bad.
Oh, like, what is the point of it?
What is the point of going to that effort?
Create that.
No effort was spent in this.
Or some effort.
We like, he dragged the timeline.
He did specifically like things that would at least release it.
Deceptively first.
That's a long time away from someone saying is Ralph
tweeting about us right now?
Is Ralph tweeting about us?
Oh, he's typing at us.
I doubt it. I doubt it.
He's not going to want to consider himself with us.
We're pathetic compared to him.
Oh, he's he already has that kind of parody in the truck.
I was Mupa. That wasn't about me.
Yeah, I'm sorry. I confused Mupa with you.
Don't be stupid.
How the fuck did you manage to confuse those?
They're completely different.
Is Mupa supposed to be mauler?
So I think so.
My computer just did a weird thing.
Did it.
What did you do?
I I'm asking you.
Oh, I do.
Oh, my computer went.
Did all of these computers sound like everything slowed down for.
Oh.
Oh, well, yeah, I guess that leads us into the good old fashioned superchas.
Perch man, would anybody like to eject?
Hmm. I shall stay as long as I can.
You have to have to go ahead and go.
Thanks for having me on. Appreciate it.
Well, you can't go until you talk about your channel.
Oh, right.
That's where he lives with Hitler.
Oh, literature devil.
The channel I run is called Literature Devil, which should be pretty easy.
And I basically do this as talk about part of the building blocks of writing,
looking into creative writing, going over movies, pop culture,
all those sorts of things so that everyone can kind of see where things are going
and see for themselves and modern media, how things are still true,
even after hundreds or thousands of years sometimes.
Yeah, I mean, I have posted away in both the chat and it's in the
description on.
I mean, I think you've been a wonderful addition to today's stream.
Despite all of the tisms that we've had to deal with, plenty of good responses.
It's good discussion.
And yeah, thanks for coming on, sir.
It's been fun.
A lot of fun. Very good discussion. Very, very fun.
For all the things they say about Satan, he wasn't that bad.
He wasn't that bad at all.
He wasn't that bad at all.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think he's literally the devil.
I think he's literally the devil.
Oh, my God.
Literature Devil.
Literally, Satan.
I did. That's how I proved it.
Isn't that like a food, Satan?
I think so.
That's a person who lives in hell.
Stop fucking around. Jesus.
It's supposed to be Satan.
I think so.
But thanks for having me.
Appreciate it.
And you all have a good day.
Have a good night.
Goodbye, Satan.
Come back any time.
Bye, Satan.
Bye, Satan.
Don't get hit by a bus.
Oh, that is very specific.
Um, Alos, Alos Miguel said,
did you guys get credit to Jay Longbone?
Because she made these points already.
I'm actually looking forward to seeing her coverage.
I wasn't going to watch it until we did.
I didn't want to spoil the video.
I don't know if she if she's made similar points,
it wouldn't surprise me because
he's wrong in very definitive ways.
So it's very easy to be like,
no, because this.
Also, he's not tweeting about us.
He hasn't tweeted for like two weeks.
Doesn't surprise me.
I don't think he's going to care that much.
Well, I mean, he put that thing in his video, but I don't know.
It seems to really care.
He seems to be really like he had several
like bitter snipes at the idea that people would respond to him.
He was very upset that people like this movie.
Respond to it.
He seems to really care that people are going to respond to him.
It's just like your opinion, bro.
He disabled the replay thing.
And then he was like, oh, if you like this movie, 14 year old.
You're 16 year old.
So Raga's.
Yes.
The stream got like cut into two again for no reason.
Why I had to reload it because.
That I have chat up on the right and there wasn't
you weren't saying anything.
And I assumed that something had gone wrong, not just like people had fucked off.
You know, yeah, so it's going to be in two pieces, which means
well, we're at 22 minutes on this stream.
So we only go to time cap.
Oh, boy, we can go on forever and ever forever and ever.
We'll never leave.
Oh, my God.
Stream in the shower.
We'll stream while we eat.
We'll stream while we poo.
Stream the stream while we sleep.
Stream forever.
Oh, that was something that I was.
Yeah, we can do that.
We have plenty of time to do it now.
So this this was a selection of comments I found interesting
and obviously as a counter to the idea that
like this would this didn't go over well as a
a parody, I guess.
Would you like to would you like to read some of these, Mr.
Riggeroo?
All righty.
So the Golden Caulk.
And I said, I can tell Ralph let the haters get to him.
This video was over the top vitriolic
to which ocean man responded.
I mean, he searched a three year old 4chan thread
to find a negative comment about himself.
So, yeah.
I just can't imagine myself like going out of 4chan period,
but going through three year old 4chan threads
to find people talking about me.
Those people are three years older now.
That could be like a 12 year old who made that comment.
And they're 15 now.
They've grown up.
Or they could have reverse aged because they got younger.
And now they seem to like us on 4chan.
Like that was just one comment I showed.
They don't like either of us for some reason.
I don't fucking care.
They're okay with Mauler.
They don't like Shad.
They don't like Shad?
Oh my goodness.
There's just no possible way to know who they like
and who they don't like.
So next one says, I gotta say Ralph sounds a little whiny
and condescending in this review.
Not a good look, my guy.
There's no lightheartedness or quick quips in this review.
It feels really angry and aloof.
Quick quips.
Don't put violins in movies.
Ralph doesn't like violins.
Even if it fits the tone or whatever,
Ralph just really doesn't like violins.
Don't do it.
It does come across as if he was molested by a viola
when he was a child.
And so just all-
No, shut up, shut up.
I'm not done yet.
And so it's like now all members of the string family,
he just can't, he's like, you're close enough.
So I'm sorry, violins.
Sorry, cellos.
You can't-
Cello.
Cello.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Um.
He doesn't like dulcimers.
What the fuck is that?
You know, dulcimers?
That sounds like a made up word.
No, well, all words are made up.
So a dulcimer is a, it's like a table harp.
I understand it so much better now.
No, like really, like look at it.
It's like a little-
Is it like a Japanese or Korean instrument?
The one there goes boing, boing, boing.
Yeah, that one.
Boing.
Is that a dulcimer?
No, sort of.
Metal, stop yelling from the toilet.
You can't stop me.
You know, it's like a thing where you can have them,
like they're like, they're like sideways guitars
and you lay them down and you kind of pluck at them.
Yeah, that's like the Korean thing, right?
Wow.
I don't-
Wow.
I mean, I don't-
Some Asian place.
Wow.
But they could also be like a stand,
they could be like on a stand.
Like a book stand, like a desk or something.
And they have the strings over them.
I agree with you.
Was that metal?
I think so.
Yes, of course.
I agree with you.
Thank you.
The next one says, I went to film school, okay.
The YouTube review,
which I think is actually pretty on point as well.
That's this video in a nutshell.
Then you go, this is such a horribly condescending review.
It feels like Ralph's actually trying
to piss off his fan base.
I don't see the point in saying that this film
isn't to the standard of specific current art house,
less mainstream films,
apart from just trying to sound like
some elitist pretentious film snob.
One of them,
one of the many things I appreciate about this film
is the fact that it showed the average moviegoer
a style of film that may not have experienced before.
If they haven't decided to watch classic Scorsese films
or whatever.
And as it was presented in a more accessible way
than some of the films,
I was able to have proper discussions about the themes
and ideas presented in Joker
with people that usually don't look too deeply in the film.
Into the film, sorry.
I'm a huge fan of Taxi Driver.
And all the Scorsese films.
And I managed to enjoy the fact that
Joker took inspiration from that
as well as other Scorsese films.
And it added to my overall enjoyment of the film.
I don't think that-
I was copying and you're bad.
I know.
I don't think that Danira's death
was really meant to be that surprising.
And my reading of the film was that
it was flashback showing Zazibeatz to not exist
to a more of a representation of his realizing
rather than showing the audience.
And even if I'm wrong with the intention of that scene,
I don't see the problem
of making the film more accessible.
I also felt the inclusion of Bruce Wayne's storyline
added a nice parallel to Arthur's storyline
and was done very tastefully as well
as providing a very different presentation of the Waynes
to any of the Batman related work
we've seen on the big screen.
However, my general distaste for this review
isn't so much that I disagree with it.
It's also the fact that it seems to be badly thought out
and overall very toxic and petty.
Normally a fan.
That's got like 400 upvotes.
This is where I made like, this did not go over well.
What if the Joker movie was like,
like he kind of had the intention of,
this is how we introduce artsy kind of movies
to like just normal audiences and stuff.
And that was the intention.
And here's Ralph coming and just fucking shit.
Like, this is stupid for dumb people.
It is stupid for dumb people.
You liked it, you're dumb, moron.
I'm dumb, I liked it.
Therefore, I am dumb.
If I like something dumb, that means you're dumb.
Rogald Dole said, wow, I'm here really early.
And so I said, no, the stream dies.
You missed 10 hours.
Oh, did we start 10 hours ago?
No, I was just exaggerating.
We started, we started like eight, so nine, 10, 11.
Rex, you're okay.
Six hours ago.
Okay, I'm all right.
I'm fine.
4chan doesn't like me though.
So I must be doing something right.
I don't understand what 4chan's values are.
Oh, there he goes.
Well, like a.
Parentheses merchant.
Parentheses.
I don't understand.
That didn't help.
And he's not gonna help you anymore, apparently.
He's leaving you.
Abandoning you.
What is what are 4chan's values like anti tumblr?
4chan's values, it's difficult to pinpoint,
to put it to put a pen on the point of the pen.
I want to talk about the allegorical metaphors and parasite.
I mean, of course, fucking standard response.
The do us all a favor and talk about the allegorical metaphors
and parasites that are childishly attacking all the people
who criticize your previous take on Joker.
Seriously, Ralph, I normally like your content,
but attacking the people who like this movie
and lumping them in with an idiot 14 year old
who like BVS isn't gonna do anything
to help this harassment claim you get
whenever you talk about DC films.
I mean, they're probably right.
You know, doing that probably wasn't the best choice.
If you're gonna be like,
ah, so annoying when people harass me, those kids.
Oh.
Um.
Also.
Smell them loud.
I think we missed this one.
Cause I don't remember us talking about it,
but he said random killings
starting this incoherent sequence of events.
Then they've got like a bunch of citations
for when serious events began from singular killings.
Or more or whatever, but yeah.
Like World War I.
This was one of the weakest attempts at critiquing Joker.
I accept the issues Joker has and credit it as exceptional.
However, the issues you brought up
made no sense and were ill prepared.
I don't understand who came up with society's bad
at the end of this film
and throughout we saw a man struggling
with extreme mental illness
and childhood trauma.
In specific, Joker had narcissistic personality disorder
which made him delusional and paranoid
to the point of hallucinations and clouded thoughts.
Joker has good things in his life.
However, his mental issues negated them.
Once he stopped being medicated and without therapy,
he started to see a world darker than it is.
The film showed problems within modern society,
but more so it focused on mental illness,
parental roles, economic wealth distribution
and the idea of happiness.
This film was sad and painted a very real reality
for people who live with untreated mental disorders.
Everything really does feel like a dark cloud.
Joker just snapped unlike most of us.
Joker, like many, hasn't gotten a sense of community
and thus no identity, no clear purpose for his life.
He is suicidal, lonely and depressed.
I cannot believe you don't see the comparisons
to how this movie reflects modern society,
mental illness, loss of community,
economic disparities, et cetera.
What a sad review, re-evaluating.
Damn.
Yeah, it's like, it's, oof.
How did he think this was gonna go down?
Like, fuck.
I don't know.
How come they don't make watermelon jelly?
What the fuck is going on?
I don't know.
We need the answer to that.
Just saying.
Somebody give us the goddamn answers.
Fuck.
We do make watermelon jelly.
I just found it.
We make watermelon jelly.
Yeah, I'm sure it's like out there,
but you'd think that is prominent.
Like, whatever.
It's just like grapes.
Okay.
Okay, strawberries.
Okay.
Then they have the weird purple-y, red-y mixed berry ones,
but it's never like, you're never like,
can I get some watermelon jelly?
It's never-
Recipe is watermelon jelly.
I'm sure it exists.
Fuck, you make jelly with watermelons, you fuck.
I'm sure that they do.
I mean, like, just why don't they just like normally do it?
How come it's like a specialty?
Why do we settle for strawberry and grape?
And we're like, oh no.
It's an injustice, I guess.
What else can we say?
Anyway, I'm probably gonna start reading
them super chats now.
So, here we go.
I volunteer myself to be a mod
that Pimabans anything,
even discreetly mentioning anime in this chat.
Efap is for top tier media discussion,
not gay anime trash.
Damn.
That's a hard truth right there.
Oh God, not this video.
Time to start drinking.
It wasn't that bad, right guys?
Guys?
I thought it was pretty good.
Yeah.
Okay, I'm not saying it,
I'm not saying all I'm saying is that it wasn't perfect.
Yeah, it wasn't perfect.
Okay, fine.
I wanna meet Moopa, by the way.
Moopa sounds like a dick.
I don't have money, Efap.
Come on, Moopa.
It didn't seem to have any vision, the cock.
This one just says Jeb three at Knuckles.
I mean, I can't make Sonic Jeb.
That's racist, probably.
Hi Rags.
Hello.
Hello.
Breaking.
Thank you for supporting the channel.
If Jar Jar shotted in your mouth,
would you say yummy, yummy in my tummy
or Misa queasy from that thick brown cheesy?
If I was lucid enough in those moments
to speak as this foul creature with Sonic getting in my mouth,
I think I'd go with the second one.
Rags.
Because cheesy reminds me of
left and right.
Rags.
Yes, Jay.
Would you rather fuck Jar Jar in the ass
or have Jar Jar fuck you in the ass?
I don't know, I don't think it's Jar Jar's dick.
It's like, it's just an average dick size.
Average dick.
Does it, what kind of dick, what kind of dick is it?
Like, what does the Gungan cock look like?
Hey, let's find some rules.
If you think of like a-
Shop Rule 34 has your answer.
Cause if it's just like a human one.
Think of like a kitchen knife.
What?
Uh, yeah.
He's like waiting for the rest.
And then what?
Oh, I, I don't know.
I guess, I guess I'd let him fuck me.
Why?
Yeah, why?
Cause I just think that fucking him would be really grosser.
Like, okay.
So I don't know.
I feel like it would,
it would require more affirmative like action on my part.
This is what his dick looks like.
Oh no.
No.
Let's take a look.
Oh my God.
I'm not putting that on the screen.
That is terrible.
Oh my goodness gracious.
So it's just like a normal one.
Fucking
Can I, or if you're playing
I don't know.
How come he doesn't like die whenever he gets a wreck?
If I censor the relevant parts,
can you put it on stream?
The relevant parts?
How do you figure out the relevant parts?
It's a compliment.
I sense a 90% of the pic to it.
Are you going to attempt to make a censored version of this?
I don't even bother.
That's terrible.
He's drooping.
That means I have to save it.
He's a drippy boy though.
Oh no.
Well, that answers that I suppose.
Oi Morley ranking Iron Man 3 of a civil war.
Why?
Lies and slander.
Just clarifying lies and slander.
Save me from my suicidal thoughts Morley.
Hopefully we did with this video.
If you die, then Ralph wins.
Would you rather never ever use or utilize
any form of electronic device ever again
or have additional and irremovable taste buds
in your anus?
That was the first option.
You know what?
I'm going to go with having taste buds in my anus.
If we get some surgery done slash keep your ass clean
you'll be fine.
Yeah.
Okay, let's back up.
So I don't think we can get asshole surgery.
What?
Why not?
Keep it so clean.
Irremovable.
Yeah, besides.
Remove your ass.
But here, why don't you just keep it clean
and shove a breathman up there?
You're not looking at, you're looking at the,
you're just looking at the negatives.
Okay, so I can, it would be nice to,
while I'm getting fucked in the ass
to be able to taste the cock, I guess.
I mean, that's so positive, I suppose.
Well, can you put that on stream?
Oh my goodness.
I mean, I guess, look at this.
I can't.
I don't want to tell you.
While you're pooping, you can hold your nose.
What am I doing with my life?
Yes.
Oh my God, somebody chat said it right after I said
to hold your nose, poo.
I know, I thank you so much.
I noticed there was a smart man in the chat.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
It's a smart man in the chat.
You do.
No, it's on stream.
We're a very, we take ourselves seriously for chances, so.
This one says EFAP greater than Sardana cast.
Yes, that is correct.
We are the best podcast that ever cast.
That's correct and judge us erect.
Oh my goodness.
They're alive now?
They're alive now.
Hey guys, what are your opinions on special editions of movies and games?
Do you feel that they more often enhance or worsen the product?
I guess it depends what you mean by special edition.
Like, the H-Publica has a great video on this.
Like, you could have, I mean, it depends on what kind of special edition.
I was going to say, the problem is like, H-Publica's video is about like,
how the editions will change the thing, but like, it can go in all different directions.
Exactly, yeah, there's no, I don't think there's a rule for it.
Just, it was case to case.
Like, yeah, I mean.
Like, a negative aspect could be like,
Hey, this is a special collector's edition
and if you pre-order, if you give us money
before we give you a fucking product
then we'll give you a shiny pair of trousers
for the game for your first three levels.
Yay!
Oh my god, it's the Hot Dogler.
Hot Dogler.
The Hot Dogler trousers, that's where it's at.
It's the Hot Dogler.
Oh yeah.
Oh.
There was some funny memes actually that I enjoyed.
Hot Dogler.
Oh, that was sent by Palpa meme.
Palpa meme.
So, yes, the answer I suppose is that you'd have a preference for them to be a good thing
but they could be an anything and they mostly are...
I don't even know what you'd say about them.
What is the current state of special editions mostly?
No, there aren't that many of them are there?
I don't know.
Your opinion is relatively...
There's only been like seven ever.
There's not enough to be able to say anything about it.
I'm so sorry.
Someone do science.
Mola, do science now, do it.
When...
When Mola makes his blah-la-la noise, my peeing tingles.
Neat.
Mm-hmm.
Oh my goodness.
The breaks, what are you doing?
I'm sorry.
I was...
That's okay.
No, I was...
It was fine.
I was thinking about blah-la-la.
Blah-la-la.
Blah-la-la.
And then you just hear...
You just hear the bottom of your desk.
And it's like, oh, fuck.
There it is again.
Fuck a big Jar Jar cock.
Because he said, blah-la-la.
That's how the Gungans mate.
That's how their foreplay is.
They go, blah-la-la.
Blah-la-la.
What is happening?
I said Mola, that was direct as cuts.
It wasn't just direct as cuts.
It was like all kinds of different cuts,
multiple cuts from singular people,
or directors, or producers, or whatever else.
It's just like, that's why it's probably better
to just call them special editions at that point.
These are my films, Uncut, like my Jar Jar Cocks.
Mm-hmm.
Toss a coin to your long man, Shabbat Shalom rags.
Ah, Shabbat Shalom, mind-fuhrer.
I've got to get hay for pets today,
but I was wondering, is it too late to make a Joker review?
Life has just been hectic, and it's super delayed.
Never too late, my man.
I'm planning on bringing mine out, like, eventually,
so there you go.
I'll be doing it.
You can do it, too, with candy.
C's eFap notification?
Oh, what's this?
Slams Rhino Milk.
What did you bring me?
I brought you a jar.
What'd you bring me?
What'd you bring me?
Jar Jar Cock.
No.
Mola, are you a Darkest Dungeon fan?
Can you say, back to the pit, as menacing as possible?
What is the voice of the guy like that?
Let me pull him up a second.
Would you bring me, me, me, me?
Did you show the hot dog?
He did.
Chief among my early pursuits.
Like, pretty epic.
Back to the pit.
I want someone to make a meme that's like,
Okay.
So, I sort of realized that I hadn't, like,
registered if anyone else was talking when I started.
I was like, that's a bad thing to do.
So, what was your meme?
I want someone to make a meme that's like, people.
eFap is a hateful, leftist, right-wing podcast about
insulting people.
And then eFap, and then it's just this meme, the hot dog.
This meme, the hot dog.
Mola, the new Batwoman episode is so horrible.
They turned the SJW shit up to 11.
Ooh, we'll be finding out about that soon.
Because all the episodes we've seen, they're just like normal bad.
They're just fucking terrible.
And it's almost like the political stuff is just like,
Oh, and by the way, our politics are garbage.
Just then, you know.
Just remind you.
Also, check out eFap the movie if you guys want.
Just a suggestion.
Sure.
Are we in a movie?
Joker is a movie about clowns made for children.
True.
Space clowns.
Sissy clowns.
Sports clowns.
Come clowns.
Sissy clowns.
EFap criticizes someone's work.
Me starts playing Jaeger from Blaz Blue.
I don't know what that is.
I think it's a fighting game.
I think it's fighting.
Blaz Blue.
Hi, horseman, death of PC gaming.
Where does the Schmooze, Schlingle-Dingle language come from?
What what came from where I think I think those were Welsh words.
If you're trying to communicate with you, Mahler,
using the words of your own people, speaking like a dangus, Dingle Dorm,
Glorm, I think I can't remember how that started, but that was
speaking like a dangus, Dingle Dorm, Glorm, Me and Mel been doing that
for many years now in the Glormen Shreemple Dample.
Indeed, that's my language.
Yeah, I can't.
I can't remember where that came from.
It's good that it exists.
Is this the kind of thing that could evolve naturally?
Yes, a couple of hack frauds discussing a work that took 12 years to make
or however long Ralph has been making videos.
Coincidence? Also, Hi-Rex.
Hello.
Joke a bad because it reminds me of a good movie.
It makes sense.
I felt that way about the second Lord of the Rings film.
I was like, you're reminding me of the other Lord of the Rings film.
Boo.
This reminds me of the Fellowship of the Ring.
Lord of the Rings is the Lord of the Rings trilogy is just a shallow copy
of the Hobbit trilogy.
Oh, my God.
That's outrageous.
You said that, and I'm going to tell all of the people.
Which ones?
Have you listened to Oakley Dokely yet?
Actually, yes, I checked it out.
That's hilarious.
Screamo Bands, The Space Devil's Ned Landers.
Oh, right. I forgot about that.
Oakley, Oakley Dokely.
Good to see the literature.
I didn't really listen to them.
You did ask your boo.
Um, give back Batwoman's soul.
Only literature devil has Batwoman's soul.
Oh, God, Satan.
Well, if she died, she'd probably go to hell.
Yeah.
Have you considered efapping Cosmonaut's recent video on the prequels?
It's beyond awful.
And hey, it gives you guys an excuse to rewatch them.
Yes, actually.
We're going to do all three of his Star Wars videos eventually, though.
He's not going to take to that very well.
He really doesn't like me.
But I mean, it's just it's just a really good video to talk about the prequels
with because it's really badly made.
So like, you know.
Jay, what do you think of Cosmonaut as a whole as a reviewer?
You think he's pretty good, right?
I would say that I do think of Cosmonaut as a whole.
Oh, my God.
Jay Ra. Oh, my goodness.
Oh, I got a hole.
Jay's a hole.
Here's some of my first paycheck.
Also, high regs.
Hello. Thank you for part of your first paycheck.
Thank you very much, sir.
That's nice thing for you to do.
I love to see dragon demands on efap.
He's fun and extremely knowledgeable.
Lots about lots of geek culture and his rants on D&D really cathartic.
Oh, it's supposedly.
Gotta love how out of touch Ralph is in this video,
having no understanding of the film, its fans slash audience,
the criticism or jokes at him. It's sad.
He didn't seem happy for sure.
He seems bitter and upset and angry.
The problem is not disagreeing with your audience.
The problem is how you fucking put it over.
And if you say in the first five minutes, you're all children.
They're just complaining about the movie.
It's like, yeah, just you lost already.
These are fucking lost already.
It's not going to take about this better tasting.
Yeah, you can.
You can either go ahead and present your 14 year old
and see what the people say about it,
or you can just fucking sell the whole fucking fan base
and just fucking end yourself with this thing.
I don't know. Oh, my God.
It's Saturday.
It's Saturday, Saturday, already Sunday for me.
We were talking about Rebecca Black. Was that live?
I don't think so.
Seven a.m.
Like if people found out that we were funded by Rebecca Black's
and the syrup hole.
Right. What happened to all the other colors of Rebecca?
And she isn't isn't what happens when you put them all together.
They make like a brownie color and then she just like puts them.
I like it.
He said make a brownie.
Is there something wrong with that, sir?
No, it's just funny.
The best vision of the Joker is from Batman Beyond Return of the Joker.
It made the Joker truly scary to the point where Mark Hamill was unsettled.
Oh, and and there's an isn't there like a Batman
where he gets transported back to samurai time?
Oh, Batman Samurai or whatever.
And was that was called?
Yeah, I swear it's called something like that.
Batman colon samurai, I think it is.
That man said that colon.
Mm hmm.
It's called that.
It's called Batman Samurai.
Batman Ninja.
I would much rather watch Batman colon Samurai.
Audience score is 39 percent.
Oh, my God.
That's not very good.
Hello, gentlemen.
Batman Ninja. Hello.
Hello. Does anyone have a copy of Wolf's podcast with the Bilbo meme started?
I know he said he didn't want them re-uploaded,
but I just want to see the clip of the original Bilbo meme.
If anyone has it new that has been lost to time.
No copies, but anyway.
But we did cover it in one of the faps at one point.
I remember which one it is specifically, but it's in there.
Unless someone has it downloaded somewhere, it could be like, I don't.
I honestly, I don't think anyone could call it because it got deleted like really quick.
Annie, Misa trying to sneak around, but the clapper Misa ass cheeks keep a lid.
Because I'm impatient, what's wrong with the Mandalorian?
The writing is terrible.
Writing is really bad.
Sorry, it's so hard for me to concentrate right now.
OK, so in a nutshell,
and please don't hold me to this, it's really it's really hard concentrate.
So the Mandalorian is a show that's really bad.
Characters are extremely inconsistent.
And a lot of times they do extremely stupid things
that are very out of character, just so things can happen.
And we decide arbitrarily that they just forget
like extremely important things about their own lives.
And they're they just in all sorts of baptisms like that, right?
Like there's just no it's like the writing is just nonsense.
Things just happen so they can happen.
Characters decide when they need to be competent
for the sake of when something has to like happen or for drama sake
or stuff along those lines like like I just like they're one of the episodes
happens because because Mandalorian forgets he has a spaceship.
Really? Yes.
Episode four happens because they write it so that Mandalorian forgets
he has his own spaceship.
Wow. And that's on top of forgetting that Forbes exists.
Yes. It's like they just have a little shit.
They just have like him randomly forgetting
extremely important parts of like imagine you're a plumber, right?
And your TV, you're like a plumber and you just forget how to flush a toilet.
And so they have a whole episode about how you have to track down
the secret knowledge of the toilet flush and you go on a big adventure.
Yeah. But then you're like, oh, wait,
the only reason this episode is happening
is because we just wrote it to where this plumber,
who's been a plumber his whole life, forgot how to flush the toilet.
Um, it rags just you're working on a video, right?
Someone said, sorry, I just got to disagree with you.
It was a bad love to know what about that you disagree with
because that's what the writing of the show is.
They forget Forbes exists, forgets the spaceship.
That's just one. This is an example from an episode.
This is like canon that they forget, or does the writing get these things?
Well, the writing is just they just don't.
He just doesn't mention it when it would solve the issue.
And there wouldn't be a problem if he just was like, oh, I got a spaceship.
Yeah, for anybody who's not clear, he they asked, like,
what could possibly take out an ATSD and they have like his enormous
cannons on his ship, but they just don't.
They just don't.
Oh, right. I remember.
If for me, it was like just paid for the average.
Like it started really strong.
It's like, oh, why are they going through this?
And I was like, well, not a week.
We live the week. We live the week.
And then I stopped and I just stopped watching because I couldn't talk anymore.
And Matthew said to be fair, it spends most of the time in the woods.
They still need to pay it out.
It's like the issue Rags is taking was the statement.
It's like we have no way to take it out.
It's like you do.
Yeah. And then they just do the thing where they learn out and then he blows it up.
And yeah, we're going to do an episode on Mandalorian as well.
Huh? We'll do an episode on Mandalorian on our list.
We'll do a Mandalorian episode.
OK, you know, it's it'll be on the way. It's OK.
I know a lot of people love it.
We'll we'll have to be thorough.
We'll have to go through it all piece by piece.
Yes. What happened to Jared?
Is he dead? Is and if he is, have you guys found a replacement?
If you mean for Beams, it's like we've got a plethora of memes.
But but I don't know what's going on with Jared these days.
I want to check in.
Taxi driver spawned more violence than Joker.
John Hinkley, Reagan assassinated to fail and co-writer to I Desire by Devo.
So did Frozen 2.
Yeah, that's true. Frozen 2 beat out Joker.
Any movie that inspired violence inspired more violence than Joker.
Hello, all my Ewoks, also Hi Rags.
Hello, sir.
More, you know of a YouTuber by the name Just Some Guy.
He's a lot like you, except he covers comics instead of movies.
I don't know this man.
Nope. Would you rather Disney's next Star Wars trilogy be about the downfall
of Babu Frick, or should they make a frick Star Wars story about his past?
They made it about the downfall of Babu Frick.
Then they'd fuck it up and it would actually be the rise of Babu Frick.
Like the rise of Skywalker, the rise of Frick.
Star Wars episode 10, the rise of Frick.
We need to go to the Frick planet.
The all of the Fricks running around.
Lord of the Fricks. Yes.
Happy Chinese New Year, you massive.
Since 2020 is the year of the rat.
Do you think it means that this will be the year of good rat?
Also Hi Rags.
Hello, I hope that it's going to be the year about the good rat
because I don't want a bad rat year.
That's a quote.
Good rat forever, folks.
That's that's what I always say.
That's my catchphrase.
More or less, sorry, your critics are so fucking stupid.
Don't listen to them.
I'd be surprised if any of them had a functioning brain stem at work.
Now, kick J. Hi Rags, et cetera.
Hello. Hello.
You don't have to apologize for a terrible control of your basic bodily functions,
like your breathing and stuff.
I think. Yeah, but you could do that.
You can have someone do CPR on you forever.
Oh, did you hear about that?
There was I was reading it.
So there's this is apparently an octopus that can sting you in such a way
that it makes you numb all over your body for 15 hours.
And then you recover and there's no permanent side effects.
That sounds pretty cool.
But obviously, if you don't have any assistance during those 15 hours, you die
because like everything goes numb.
Right. Like you can't breathe without assistance.
And apparently somebody was stung by an octopus, like that octopus
out in in the water or whatever.
I didn't know octopuses could sting you.
Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe I'm retarded.
It doesn't really matter what it did.
It's just the thing that did it.
Oh, my God, this octopus is stinging you.
It latched on with its talons.
OK, it has eight posts.
It's weak.
If octopuses were warm, they'd probably give insanely good blow jobs.
So anyway, should there be handshops if you could add this?
This guy was attacked by this thing.
And apparently the locals that were there at the time knew what was going to happen.
And so they just had to provide CPR, the entire boat ride back to a hospital.
And so they saved his life.
But when you're fully numb,
you obviously can't close your eyes because they're open.
Oh, so he went blind?
Yeah, the sod burnt his eyes out.
Oh, no, that sucks.
And he went blind.
I was like, oh, my God, that's the God.
They just put a wet flannel on your eyes.
Oh, no, geez.
I would be so fucking bitter about that for my whole life.
If something closed my fucking eyes, I'd be able to see.
And the fact that you're numb, you can't tell them.
You just have to be like, well, there it goes.
Yeah.
Have you ever like sat on your hand long enough to goes to sleep
and then jerked off with it?
No, like I've tried.
It's not like good.
Oh, you know, but you said you started off
and said, no, but then you're like instantly did 180 is like,
yeah, you've done it.
No, like I've attempted it.
It's not good.
So I stopped.
I stopped at the point where I sitting on my hand because I'm like, this is.
Oh, that you can't say you did it if you didn't get to the jury.
That's why I said I didn't do it.
Then you said you did.
You have civil war.
I said I attempted it.
That's fucking shit.
Monday is my birth mass.
All I request is the unquestioned
assassination of all women and Jews.
Oh, my goodness.
No, no.
In the middle of that, he's got in brackets, high rags.
Hello, I think we're going to provide that.
You said I don't ask for much.
Just give me this.
We'll have to look into our files and our our files of all of our files
to see if that's possible.
I've checked the files.
I future me also high regs.
Hello, past you.
Have you led scene 1917?
What did you think?
That was great.
I really liked it.
There's a lot of you on it.
Soon, you should go see it.
You should go see Jay's review.
Yeah. All right.
Yeah, fine.
I guess Rags just promote the shit of your challenge.
Was the one shot thing just a gimmick?
Or do you think it contributed to the film?
It really contributed to the film.
It really did contribute.
Yeah, it contradicted to the film.
Yes, it really helped me to think that I was there.
Yeah, taking this journey with them.
Can you hear?
Apparently, so someone in chat said it's from the blue ringed octopus.
They make heterodox toxin, tetrodotoxin.
And if the poison is transferred by a bite.
All right.
Well, this is a fucking dick.
Listen to the cinema since podcast take on T.R.O.S.
It's the definition of Tism.
Destroy them.
Oh, that sounds like fun, actually.
That sounds like a good.
That sounds like good material.
But I mean, what, do you want to check?
You guys don't do that, I will.
I mean, you go ahead.
I'll check it out with you if you want.
Then you could do whatever you want with it.
Sounds like fun.
Where do they do that?
Introducing Sincast, is that it?
Yeah.
Where does they?
Oh, my God, is that where Satan is?
Were we just while Satan was just here?
Oh, it's a Yotel channel.
Was it actually on YouTube?
One wing, three behind the sins mini pod.
Rise of Skywalker.
I guess that's it.
Came out.
Stere Hwaxaka.
Why did you say that like normal?
Why would you say that?
I know, I just I was going to you speak normally a lot.
And I'm wondering why you always do that.
Why don't lies and slander lies and slander.
I've told you why I don't like that phrase.
I've told you why I like it.
Well, then we're in an impasse.
I passed the impasse.
I wonder if anyone watching like right now knows what.
I guess they probably wouldn't because you can't.
Ah, that's true.
Wait, but then how did you reply to the thing I said?
Because I had half of it.
But I've seen the raffles video.
I think that's supposed to be Ralph.
And it made me consider committing a jebicide.
Oh, my God.
Keep up the long out of this.
He's a fucking saint.
Keep up the long hail the dawn when TFA part three.
Kick J. Hi rags yesterday.
Hello.
August 2020.
Damn, one K new subs a day by the fruits.
You shall know also.
Send Lisa in here.
I don't know what that is.
Sounds like Dutch.
No, it's not Dutch as well.
Oh, I didn't say it was Dutch.
I said it sounded like Dutch.
No, it doesn't sound like that.
Oh, apparently it means long man's hail.
But you don't speak Welsh.
What kind of a Welsh you don't speak Scottish.
You don't know that.
Oh, I checked the Scottish files.
You're not listed if I speak perfect Gaelic.
No, not Gaelic Scottish.
What is this difference between what is Scottish then?
You don't know what I see.
You don't even know what it is.
So of course you don't speak it.
No, I'm asking.
I'm asking what you think it is.
So you don't know exactly what it is.
It's it's when you pronounce everything like a Scottish.
I know exactly what.
Oh, I can't do that.
I just choose Nazi.
Does anyone believe him?
I'm sorry, what was the question?
Statistically, at least someone believes me.
All right, fine.
One person believes you.
You said August.
What the fuck you actual hack.
Rags said it would be August.
What am I going to do? Betray rags?
Yes, you cannot.
I cannot be betrayed.
I cannot be defeated.
It says, hi, Wags.
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?
I am. I'm a good boy.
That's me.
And I guess it ends with Mr.
Metal and Mr. Literature.
I guess it's like a hello of sorts.
Hello. Hello.
I re-watched Joker two days ago.
What are the odds?
I know. Unlikely.
Seven. I don't even know how I can get it.
Yeah, it's a seven.
Seven odds.
What is the chance of this? Seven.
Seven.
Hello, Massives.
Just letting you know that the 80s Star Wars droids cartoon,
which can be found here on YouTube, has a character named Kaibo Ren.
Kaibo Ren. Really?
That's interesting.
Is it, though?
Yeah, I think it's interesting.
Yeah, kind of.
Fine.
I don't think he understands why that's interesting.
I think he's just lost.
Mel, you lost.
Where am I?
Knew it.
Help.
29.15 at L.D.
Good to see you here, finally.
Oh, for Literature Devil, of course.
Been subbed to you well before I subbed to Wolf.
Hashtag who the fuck is smarter?
Hashtag what rags?
What?
Sounds like a question.
Like, what rags?
Hashtag what rags?
Which rags?
Rags, do you remember what you said seven hours ago?
Um, hello?
I don't say that a lot.
I just figured it would be like...
I just figured it would be like something I'd do.
I highly recommend Uncut Gems.
It's my favorite film of 2019, followed by The Irishman and Joker.
Would love to know your thoughts if you've seen it.
That's actually next on our list.
Me and Rags are going to watch that.
Which was next of all?
Uncut Gems.
I've heard that it's a good movie.
I can consider watching it as well.
And this guy says, my taxi driver is his all-time favorite movie.
Good.
I'm sorry.
No.
At rags, Mauler is not a paladin.
He's a longbowman.
If you disagree, I challenge you to butt naked Greco-Roman wrestling in a tub of astroglide.
That's hot.
Oh man, that is a fucking smooth, that is a fucking smooth.
Also hijack.
You're more of a warrior.
Hi.
Well, I can't beat everything.
I'm a rogue.
Oh, are you now?
Yes, I'm a rogue.
How did you determine this?
I, um...
Exactly.
It's just my class.
You can't ask me to determine things like this.
It's just how it is.
I believe I would be a Gandalf.
You mean like a wizard?
A wizard wizard?
Wizard wizard.
Wizard.
Wizard.
Um, will you go out with me?
I don't date incels.
Oh, that is perpetual right there.
Yeah.
Hey, efabbas.
Hello.
Hello.
Hope you touch on that fat wannabe voice actor pro-ZD's tism conniption about Joaquin's
method acting.
Oh, that was from him, I guess.
Yeah, I know I like him too.
I don't know why he was tweeting about me.
But okay.
Um, thanks for being entertaining and educational.
Listen to Death Metal.
I mean, I don't know how to interpret that.
Is he asking Metal to listen to Death?
Metal, listen to Death.
I don't have a direct connection to Death Metal.
What's Death saying?
Check my phone here for a second.
You have to...
You actually look...
You really have like seven texts from Death.
The latest one just says, do not ward J.
Can we call Death?
Don't text him back.
He'll know you read it.
I asked Google, can we call Death?
And it said, here we go.
And I got a link to The Gateway We Call Death, a book by Russell M. Nelson.
Oh.
Read it all.
I don't think I can actually read all of it.
You can't read?
No, I cannot read.
That's depressing.
Why did you forget how to learn how to read?
In The Gateway We Call Death, Elder Nelson has served in my profession.
I'm bored already.
Awesome.
Let's continue.
Okay.
Uh, every time you stream, I have to do something that stops me watching.
Start police college on Monday.
I'm going to quote Hot Fuzz constantly.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Hot Fuzz is a good movie to quote.
I'm going to watch The Joker on Monday with my family and it'll be my fourth time watching
it.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
Love you more.
Oh, wow.
Thank you.
I love you.
Oh, they'll put a little lesson three as well.
Adora Babbles.
Um.
I finally watched American Beauty the other day and I loved it.
Feel the plot and characters were very well done along with Kevin Spacey's performance.
Yeah, it's a really good film.
Shame about that.
That's a knowledge.
Yes.
Not touchy.
Can't wait to watch this in full.
Keep of the great content, guys.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
I appreciate your company and patronage.
Yes.
I was wondering how long it would take to get literature devil on.
Love your content and hello to the eFap crew.
Hello.
Yeah, we got them on.
There was supposed to be a second guest today who still hasn't gone back to me.
So they might be a bit late, but more than likely not coming on.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
I'm surprised they didn't send me any messages.
Love listening to you guys while I play games, going through Witcher 3 and waiting for my
new graphics card to arrive.
And most importantly, hi, Rags.
Hello.
Who's this to get you a tall glass of rhino milk?
How very wonderful.
I set a preview appearing in the chat.
Who is the character on the left in that?
I think that's supposed to be George Lucas.
Well.
I didn't close the tab of JoJo rule 34 when I
And then I tapped out my game and I was just confronted by like a massive JoJo with tits.
And I was like, oh, right.
Yeah, that's what I was doing.
It's only natural to pursue such exploits.
Yes.
Hello, eFaps.
You always make my day.
Thank you.
And hi, Rags.
Hello.
Always late, but love you guys.
And now I have something to listen to during work.
Hooray.
Hello, Wags.
Hello.
Long man.
Hello.
And metal.
Hi.
There was nothing for you, Jim.
Sorry.
Oh, not really.
Sorry.
Hello, Rags.
Hello.
Please.
Are at P3.
Kyle in RP.
Have no mercy.
Are at P3.
What do you think that says?
Rags.
Come on.
Rags.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Are at P3.
Really?
Is that supposed to be like rape?
He nailed it.
I wouldn't do that.
He's part of my party, and I'm always on the party side.
Well, what if it's consensual rape?
Is that OK?
Oh, I mean, it's not possible.
Oh, OK.
What if it would it OK, what if you're like role playing it and you've consented to it?
Does that not count?
I guess that's the closest you can get.
But it wouldn't technically count, though.
I get a court of law.
I don't think that would count.
I answer my own question.
You know, Mahler, it's easy for you to be like, oh, you get it.
But you see it.
You could see it visually.
So it's obvious to you.
I honestly, I thought you could picture letters.
I just like.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
Here's the thing.
Not right now.
Very well.
I had the idea that the whole Joker movie is in his head and that Wayne's death at the end is the idea of a punch line.
He laughs when he reads the story of them dying.
I can't afford to type it all out.
I would imagine the whole movie is his recanting of the events that brought him to the asylum and that he would have found out about the Wayne death.
Or deaths later and that recanting it knowing that it ends like that is quite funny for a lot of reasons that are important to how he parallels with Bruce in relation to the families and the upbringing and stuff.
Good.
Huge fan joining late.
Have you addressed the media's obsession with in cells and incitement to violence, a position I don't personally agree with?
It's weird.
The whole thing is weird.
How many actually violent insults have there been?
Like a few.
Don't even make sense.
If you're not having sex, you've got to shoot something.
Shoot your load or shoot some bullets.
Yeah.
Rags, when does the doggo's next video release?
I don't know.
I've been working on it though.
Like I've been progressively.
Progressive.
Sorry.
Like in a like I've been being able to like every day.
Not today, though.
Today I was fucked.
But like in most days, I'm actually able to sit down and I could do like a bit and I can keep adding to it and I can keep adding to it.
So it's kind of like I feel like I'm back in the swing of things, you know.
Well, people are saying that we like.
No, no, no.
It's all good.
It's all good.
We go down for a second.
I think so.
Last thing we need is to split this into three.
Put the dicks back in.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Why are we talking about Joker?
Black Widow is coming out.
Ooh.
It's true.
It is coming out.
We had to cover the Joker video because it was terrible.
That's true.
I have a friend who says she doesn't like Calvin and Hobbs solely because it isn't diverse enough.
I disagree, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.
Enjoy.
This is stupid reason.
I like something.
Sure.
There's a lot of progressives who would hate you for saying that.
It's about.
I mean, I don't know.
Like, like the main characters are a little human boy in a fucking tiger.
They're not even the same species.
Why would that matter?
Racist.
Yeah.
Pretty diverse.
In it.
Isn't it?
I started dating a new girl whose brother is an Efap fan.
We had a discussion in which we spoke in Efap lore.
Oh, my God.
It was a good time.
So if you're watching this.
Hi, Jeffrey.
Yes.
Hello, Jeffrey.
Mark.
Hello, Jeffrey.
Discuss in Efap's language, which of which is very comprehensive.
Not yet complete.
But, you know, we're getting there.
Your jab's fallen over and you get to vote twice.
And what are the other ones?
All of the other ones.
There's like 17 billion.
You know this.
You mean.
I'm stupid.
Billion.
Sup, you massive n-worded J long boned Ewoks.
Some of that person answered it for us.
That's me.
BRB PewDiePie, I got to watch King of Comedy.
What?
Okay.
Have fun.
You're probably back twice by now.
Mm hmm.
Efap on my 25th birthday.
Also, Hi Rags.
Well, happy birthday to you.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Have a good birth.
The Lion King ripped off Kimber's visuals and animation.
The story is Hamlet, not Kimber.
Fair enough.
Ripped off the visuals animation.
Talking about Scorsese, thoughts on Raging Bull.
Very well made film, but comes across as apathetic.
Almost like Scorsese hates you for watching it.
Raging Bull.
I saw Raging Bull with my dad like when I was super youngtisms.
And I don't remember a lot of it anymore.
That's a movie from 1980.
Yeah.
You're a person from 1992?
Almost.
91?
Yeah.
You were at first time.
No.
Um, you took him on a trip to Purgatory?
Yes.
Fine.
Count me in.
I don't know what that's referencing.
The cries of infinitivtisms.
Yeah, but that's not enough.
It seems specific.
That's all I got.
I'm sorry.
I hate you.
Mom.
Literature Devil.
I love your videos.
Found you on Smudboy Streams.
Yep.
Oh, that's something else I could have said, I suppose.
If you like Literature Devil responding to stuff,
he does it regularly with Smudboy on Smudboy's channel.
Smordboy.
Go and florm his glorms, I guess.
Go and florm his glorms.
Didn't Disney have to put Kimber the White Lion on their video release as a special feature
because of the claims that the story was stolen?
No idea.
I'm waiting for someone to-
Because there is a video that I think is going around that explains it,
but YMS said he'll do a take on it.
I'll watch that.
See what I'm missing.
Yo, Mauler.
Saw you got some unwarranted hate on Twitter yet again.
Hang in there, man.
And fuck them.
They're wrong.
Yeah, it was weird.
I don't know why I picked up all in one day, but it was a lot of Twitter stuff.
Those fuckers, man.
I thought it was just the one person going after you that I saw.
There was a few content creators, some of them up to 2K.
Because there was a few sources.
One of them was posting the second Jenny stream.
One of them posted the comic, where Ra is throwing people off a rooftop,
if you remember, and wearing little cartoons.
That got like 2.5K of being like, this is incel art.
Something like that.
Those fuckers are always sniping.
They're throwing the first stone.
And then in the end it's like, oh, you're going around to checking people.
It's like, are you-
Yeah, and then Cosmonaut jumped in.
He was like, Mauler, you just can't take criticism, man.
You always have to like-
Fuck him.
He made the claim.
I saw that.
That I like go and search for these people and quote Twitter.
And I was like, fucking hell, man.
Do you know how many people I'm not responding to?
Yeah.
It's a lot.
It's like, people come play.
It's like, oh, I responded to one day old tweets.
Like, yes.
It was weird as well because he was like, you know,
it's causing more problems.
And I'm like, well, I'm going to defend myself.
And he was like, well, yeah, but there's got to be a better way to do it.
I was like, do you want to suggest it?
It's a conversation over.
It's like, okay.
It cannot be.
It's insane.
It's insane.
And they're also fucking smug about it.
And I'm not even active about it.
Cosmonaut has bad teeth.
I'm just looking at it.
And it was like, what the fuck are you people talking about?
You're all insane.
Just have a notification for whenever he has a good take, I guess.
It's like, it's so maddening.
It's this super dusty bell because it never rings.
I'm like, 23, 31.
It goes off.
One day, like a sunny.
The whole time has arrived.
Sunny morning.
What did he say?
There's something really glad, like milk tastes pretty good sometimes.
Okay.
Yeah, it's been pretty insane.
Like the last week, like a lot of fucking stuff.
I'm not even directly involved, but it still pisses me off.
I was like, I'm just reading.
It's like, what the fuck, man?
Just joined.
Please say you've seen 1917.
We have.
It was very good.
I also persuaded my parents to see it.
I keep tabbing out and seeing Jar Jar Paugh.
I'm like, oh, right.
I've closed it now.
Did you, did you though?
Would you like to hear my mum's review of 19?
Okay.
She said.
Nice one.
She said.
1917.
Grew up to be Joe.
The penguin.
Hot dog.
She said seen 1917.
Amazing.
My dad thought everything after the.
Spoiler was a dream sequence.
The rat scene.
We make it a rule.
No one's allowed to talk about dream sequences anymore.
I like that.
The dream sequence.
Put it down.
No.
Put down the dream sequence.
Dreams.
Dreams.
Dreams and flames.
Have you flimmed the plan in your dreamy dream?
Literature.
King LK.
Wait, what is LK?
The lice king.
What is LK?
What is LK?
What is LK?
What is LK?
What is LK?
What is LK?
The lice king.
Oh, no.
The lice king?
Well, there's got to be a king of everything, right?
So the lice have a king, too.
Why?
You've got a license for that lice.
How do you not know that the lice have a king, dude?
Come on.
I'm just very uncultured.
Yeah.
LK is a ripoff.
My work.
Mac Bilbo.
Shakespeare a bitty.
Lion King.
It's Lion King.
No, Lice King.
I figured it out.
You're a Lion King.
1917 was great.
Can't wait.
All the sequel.
1942.
World War II one.
Oh, my God.
It gets worse.
My favorite mega celestial epic, Massives to Watch.
Hello there.
Hello.
Yes, the World Entertainment and Saber Spark both did a good job in unbiased videos on Lion King's Kimber controversy, if you're ever interested.
All right.
There you go.
Yeah, I can believe it.
I absolutely can.
Efap on my birthday.
Yeah.
Looks like I'm not going to my party.
Also, Hi, Rex.
Hello.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Is Marriage Story an incel movie?
Is Marriage Story?
I don't know.
Do they fuck?
I guess we'll find out.
We'll watch that one day.
Oh, man.
I got married to somebody, but it turns out they're an incel.
But they wouldn't be an incel then.
No, they still would be.
It's not the act of marriage that prevents you from being an incel.
Oh, it's the consummation.
That would present.
I'm thinking like I'm just thinking, though, like, OK, it's 2020.
If you're marrying someone, you've probably fucked them before.
No, putting that out there.
No, you would never screw someone out of wedlock.
That is against the high Christ Christians from the high crisps.
Yes.
I don't care about the high crisps.
Give me the crisps.
Give me give me give me.
Give me as someone who suffers with mental health issues and similar struggles to Arthur.
I thought Joker handled the topic very well and accurately showed its extremes.
And what happens if it goes unchecked?
It's interesting.
You find both of those reactions plentiful.
There's people that both reactions.
So you get that one and then you get people being like that film was insulting to mentally ill people.
It's like.
We need a definitive answer.
We have to go to the illest of mentally people's to find out if they're right or not.
Good job. I'm already here.
So what you think?
Yeah, I think it's fine.
There you go.
We answered all your questions.
I think it's insulted, but that's good because the mentally ill need to be.
You think it's insulted.
Yes.
I like salt on my tomatoes.
That's a weird thing to like salt on.
I wouldn't want salt on my tomatoes.
I'm being honest.
I'm just going to put it out there.
That's just been put out there now.
That's the salt and pepper on my tomatoes.
It's tasty.
Don't touch it.
It's right there.
I like salt and pepper on my fish and chips.
That's good as well.
World War Two.
Some people did something.
Wow. They'd be that broad with everything.
That's true.
When you're going to have ER, PSA, Sitch, and Literature Devil at the same time,
so we get to look at shadows.
We could do that.
Shadows?
You got to have shadow on that as well.
So someone measures like ER talks way more in the chat when he's not like that.
He does in streams.
He's been very active in chat today.
That is correct.
Yes.
I appreciate that.
Hello.
I don't know why you enjoy this show, but then again.
What people do.
It's what I said.
Hello.
I looked into my camera and realized that was a very dumb thing to do
because it's not on.
Oh, it's on.
Hello.
It's all the one FBI agent who saw you was like, cool.
They see me.
He likes me.
Good day, Evap.
Random question for you.
Lot.
What are your takes on drive?
A friend of mine showed it to me and I didn't think it was good.
I don't know what drive is.
When it came out, liked it.
Can't remember much about it now.
Drive Google drive.
No, that's not right.
Good.
That's a nice take.
Oh yeah.
That was really detailed.
And then it means you cut out.
You cut out.
Oh, I did.
I only take on it is that it annoys me when I'm trying to Google Google drive
and it shows up instead.
Google drive.
Google drive.
Correct.
Nailed it.
Good old Google drive.
World War One isn't talked about anywhere near enough.
They shall not be forgotten.
I actually agree with that.
But people like, haven't we seen this enough?
It's like fucking name me five World War One movies.
Then they'll be like.
Joker.
Joker.
I think like what 1917 was the first film that like made me actually feel
like I feel like really empathize with the people in World War One.
It's great.
Too many World War movies.
I'm still waiting on someone to finish World War Three so we can finally see
the complete trilogy.
Yeah.
All right.
I've also seen that Shrek video.
It's a good video.
Go watch it.
Just started a 24 hour shift.
Thank you massive for making the time go by for me.
A 24 hour shift?
That sounds good.
What are you?
Yeah, that sounds illegal.
I was going to say surely that even caps out any kind of like personal thing of
being like I will do maybe he maybe he's including asleep part of it.
That's like three days of normal work for me.
Yes.
I mean.
So maybe like they have a live in position or something.
No, not live in but like.
Maybe he means like two shifts that are back to back between sleeping.
Still that's after him before sleeping.
That's that's annoying.
Tisms.
I hope it goes over well.
Yeah.
I hope we've been going for not even half of that.
But hopefully it's been some entertainment to a degree.
An hour into the stream and no notification.
Thanks YouTube.
Also.
Hi Rex.
Hello.
I like the twitch and YouTube over shit with this.
Yes.
The streets.
Maybe it's just really hard to do.
And they're doing an amazing job at it considering how difficult it is.
Let's go with that.
No, it's not.
It's not true.
But yes.
Damn.
I really used to love Ralph.
Also hug Jay.
Oh, thank you.
Hug.
You could still love Ralph.
It was just it was just a fluke.
He tripped up.
He was like, oh, I fell over and then he's going to get back up.
He'll be fine.
Howdy, Mr.
Rags.
I can't get up.
I'm sorry.
What was the question?
Howdy, Mr.
Rags.
Oh, that was a question.
Glad I was able to help out the Efap crew.
Thank you for letting me help out too.
You guys make awesome content.
I think that might be the cause I remember that guy saying that as soon as we said
that the video was from a from a flimpled angle.
And I think that was the flimpled angle that did it.
Holy shit.
And if up on my birthday, how many fucking birthdays we had today.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday.
I'm such a lucky Ewok.
Thank you, long man.
Also.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Oh, so many births that were happening today.
Births.
Does Rags believe that happen every day?
Yes.
Does Rags believe that art slash surrealist films can't be good?
What?
And then it says I'm referring to films where many aspects are left to
interpretation.
No, I said we talked today in this episode about the lighthouse and how we liked it.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
Was the super chat before that, though?
Maybe.
There you go.
I know what I must do.
I will shred this efap down to its last second and then with the objective
opinions you've collected for me, create a new one teeming with life that knows not
what it was big, not what it has been given, but only what it has lost.
That is a reference.
What is it?
Iron Man.
Oh.
When he says he's going to destroy the world and reduce it to atoms.
Oh, yeah.
And then Thanos stops him.
More like foreigners.
Yeah.
Can you imagine that in the final fight?
They just trade positions for no reason.
Everyone thinks it is normal and the whole audience is like, I don't know.
I think TLJ fans would like that.
Oh, it would subvert.
The expectations would be subvertated.
Expections.
Can y'all play Bad Day on the Midway?
It's a game made by the band The Residence who like Bad Days on Midways.
Uh.
Maybe.
I don't know what I need to add here.
Also, Hi, Mole Man.
Hello.
Hi.
No, you don't say hi to you, Rad.
You want the Mole Man?
Wait, what?
Author John C. Wright wrote a book about how awful TLJ was.
His humor reminds me a lot of Maulers.
It was good to hear from a professional writer.
Cool.
John C. Wright, eh?
Perhaps he's a long man.
Who knows?
Sounds like a long man.
Long man.
It's a whole book.
I guess their books are different.
Long, long, long man.
Ow, yeah.
Long, long, long.
You know that?
Long, long?
What?
You know that thing, right?
The long.
The Japanese long.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's actually those in no selection of me.
Anyway, the toxic brood has assimilated the bots.
Oh, yes.
I can't buy superchats larger than two dollars.
What the fuck?
I don't know if it limits based on something weird, but I'm.
I'm sorry, it's preventing you from doing the things you wish to do.
But thank you for the two dollars regardless.
What's the thing Boogie said about three dollars?
Did you say a lie?
A lie.
Three dollars is a lot for a person of color.
Yeah, there you go.
Two dollars is a lot for a person of non color, I guess.
But I have a USB drive that's also.
Thanks for your money.
So that's cool.
Oh, Boogie.
That was a deep fake for such a long time.
At least rapists and Nazis believe in something goddamn.
What do rapists believe in?
Rape.
God, I thought it was obvious.
Can someone clip that those like three seconds on their own?
What do rapists believe in?
Rape.
Please, Spabbot, steal my comments.
Maybe then someone will read it.
I need this.
Oh.
Honeycrisp apples.
All other apples are an affront to God.
Do you guys know that?
I didn't know that.
I did not know that, no.
Even if it's CGI, I couldn't tell before and I still can't tell now.
That's what makes separate CGI and adding to immersion.
I mean, yeah, we fucking we were on that topic for like 10 hours.
It took a while.
Nailed it.
That's why people think it's a parody.
And it could very well be.
It's not CGI.
It's CG weave.
That's how we're doing in communism.
It's in the name.
The name.
Don't be EA.
Leave Jay alone.
Jay is a good guy.
It's in the name, unless it's Alfred.
That's supposed to be.
Chocolate.
Also, someone just said you're a good guy.
You didn't say anything, Jay.
That's fucked up.
I'm a good guy.
Thank you.
Yeah, there you go.
What does Jay think of Deathwish slash Dirty Harry?
I know what Deathwish is.
Just skip that question for me.
Yeah.
There you go.
He's not seen it.
I'm so sorry.
Wrong.
Granny Smiths are the one true Apple.
All right.
Ask Ralph if it hurts.
Does it hurt?
I love that I threw that into my Rise of Skywalker video.
And so many people will be like, what the fuck was that?
Like when he zoomed into Kylo and said, does it hurt?
What is that?
I want to know.
I remember that.
What part was that in?
It's when I say that when I say that they have their first Skype call,
I just cut to him and go, does it?
And then it just moves on.
The part of your Rise of Skywalker video that I remember,
just like this one part that stuck with me for no reason,
which is just, you know,
when Ray sends them the coordinates and you go,
she can do that.
Woohoo.
Just the way that you said,
woohoo has stuck with me now.
And every time I want to be sarcastically pleased about something,
it plays in my brain.
Well, I can really just sort of.
Woohoo.
I can't do it.
I can't do it justice.
Rags, really want to see a new video from you.
Got anything in the works for your main channel or dog bites?
I do.
Yeah, I do.
It is coming.
It is coming along.
What I'm thinking about doing is.
I'll tell you later.
I'll tell you later.
Hadn't an argument with one of my associates about the deleted scene
in Captain Marvel just couldn't get him to see she was in the wrong.
Can I get a D and chat for the dawn?
Yes, you can.
Also, how the fuck can anyone interpret that as her doing the right thing?
Oh.
Get your D's out.
Ignore the fact that we've covered several people who think she's doing the right thing.
Just, yeah.
Humanity's disappointing.
How dare you massive start Efap during my D&D session.
Jeb and the Dom will be hearing about this.
Also, Hi Rags.
Sorry.
Hello.
Is Twilight also rated F for fuck vampires?
Oh my goodness.
There are a lot of ways to interpret that.
That's true, Jay, because do vampires even have blood?
Because if some see.
They can't get a stiffy.
Exactly.
Your mind is in the gutter with me.
They escaped the gutter before it's too late.
Is that why they drink blood to get an erection?
They have to they have to spend it wisely.
Well, how else do they make them have sex or masturbate?
I finished my review of Vanquish, which should go up on Geeks and Gamers soon.
Look for the Efap meme.
It's a game by the director of Resident Evil 4.
Have you played it?
It's a really great third-person shooter.
Vanquish is fun.
I haven't played it.
Jay, you must have played it.
It was a Steam release.
No, I don't know.
Stop making this joke about games.
Games aren't real.
It was originally a PS3, but then it got a Steam release, which was kind of good,
had a bucketism.
Can you even prove that?
I mean, it is on Steam right now.
You can just look it up.
No, you can't.
All right.
The Irishman is basically Efap.
Because it's long.
Irishman is short.
Wait, what?
How could you say that?
Oh, my goodness.
But you're here with us.
Damn it.
What?
I'm confused now.
Irishman is just long.
I think that's what they mean.
Yeah, that's the funniest.
But Irishman is downright tiny compared to the massive length of an Efap.
Puny Irishman.
You're going to burn all right, motherfucker.
Black's JC Denton.
Right.
Okay.
Rags, have you heard that Steve finally got the non sequitur show back?
Also, would you say that Ray killed Palpatine in TROS or that he killed himself?
I'm very glad that Steve got the non sequitur show back.
It's very good.
I'm very happy.
I'm very glad.
I really am.
I just sounded sincere because I'm tired.
But I really am glad.
You mentioned that earlier and I read it in the chat and I'm like, oh, that's good.
I'm very, very glad about that.
What was the second question was, would you say that Ray killed Palpatine or that he killed
himself?
I think he killed himself.
They helped each other out.
Yeah.
Like even I would be like, it's a bit of both, I guess.
Yeah.
It's kind of a group effort.
He's responsible for his own death because he just didn't stop doing lightning.
I'm just trying to picture like Rags just throwing balls at me.
But if they hit him, he dies.
And I'm just slowly directing them at him, like they're moving closer, closer.
And he sees that he just keeps throwing the ball.
He's like, it doesn't matter.
I got to keep going.
So I am, I am choosing to murder him there, but he's also seemingly okay with it.
It's just weird.
I am all the Jedi.
And I am a little of all the sick.
You're like, wait a minute.
Count Dooku goes inside Ray and he's like, this is revenge for fucking me over an episode
three.
I haven't forgotten about that shit.
You old asshole.
He goes inside.
Yes.
He goes inside.
What's wrong with that?
What about saggy drops?
What?
What about saggy drops?
I don't know.
I thought you said that.
And I was like, Jay, just because you're old doesn't mean your semen becomes saggy.
Doesn't even make sense.
Well, can you prove that?
I used science yesterday and I proved it.
How?
That's not totally up to date anymore, though.
Science.
Half of Ralph's vids are objectively good.
The other half, no.
Damn.
The other half, no.
Rags, are you eating while talking?
It makes you sound fat.
Oh, no.
No, I'm not fat.
I am pretty good looking.
I was just hungry.
I had a meat.
A meat.
Real question.
Real question for everyone here and T.S.W.G.
if she's still in the chat.
Do you guys see potential for a good story in Mando season two?
Always potential.
But they're going to have to fucking change something.
Please crank it up, fellas.
Crank it up.
I just don't care.
Racist.
No, that fucking serious just fucking lost me completely.
My name is Ray.
Ray cyst.
How have you not heard that before?
That's like one of those common ones.
I hate you.
I haven't heard that one before.
It's the first time I've heard that.
Ray, Ray, Shadow Legends.
That's the most common one I've seen.
The visual beams better because she sees like a whole bunch of like
racists as ghosts.
She's just like racist.
Ray, racist.
Also, yeah, look at that.
Jose in chat.
Wow rags.
I'm not fat.
I'm good looking.
What the heck is that?
Evilist or fattest.
I don't know which one this term is fat phobic.
Fat phobic.
Plus sized phobic rags.
I got to know what the hell keeps you belching all the time.
It's hilarious.
But why?
Today it was alcohol.
Oh, but why though?
Tomorrow.
I don't know yet.
They said also probably it'll probably be.
I know I'm not done.
I guess.
All right.
Hello.
Thank goodness.
Tomorrow.
It'll probably meet.
Because I got it because I got to finish this stuff in there.
And I bought some.
Some shrimp.
Some of those.
What the fuck is that?
I know that so well.
What's that?
But.
Shrimp.
Pivols.
No, I know that.
I know it is from Rick and Morty.
Yes.
But now you got it.
Now you got to know which episode and thing is from.
I know what it's from.
Exactly.
You got it.
You got to get a J.
Don't look at chat.
I'll be cheating.
I'm not looking at chat.
I'm halfway through.
Hello.
All right.
Well, you just put.
Just think about it and then get back to me when you find out.
Okay.
I mean, from your own brain.
Okay.
Jay, wish me a happy poop again, but make it sexy.
Have a.
Anything I say is going to be sexy.
So how do you want me to do it?
Have a.
Good poop.
I was pretty good.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Have a good poop.
That was pretty sexy.
Oi, Morley.
Like an Iron Man three of a prestige mate.
I'll kill you.
Joker beat TROS needs to be a thing in box office.
Like solar lost money.
TROS means the rise of Skywalker, by the way.
Keep it up, guys.
Love the content.
I'm not sure.
That's it.
That's a beat.
Because it's still going, right?
The rise of Skywalker.
No.
The other one.
The round orphan song.
That's the one, man.
The round orphan song.
Yeah.
I made a billy to the box office.
That's such a good movie.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
If it's not the rise of Skywalker.
Rags.
It's okay.
The world is a confusing and scary place.
But if you know the dark side, you could have access to some unnatural things that can help you get through.
Like cloning.
From any abilities that some would.
Would anyone say that they were natural?
And he's like, yeah, a few.
I think.
Naturally, it's survived.
I wouldn't say I'd like to be in the film now.
He's like, I survived the Death Star explosion.
I blew up twice.
And I'm right here.
They're like, yeah, that seems natural.
1990 smaller.
I'm tired of these mock ass busters and their tism takes rags.
Help me pop the trunk on this fool.
Nineteen nineties rags.
Woof woof.
Oh, I love that.
That little that the car makes when you open up the trunk.
I got to talk to Paul Giamatti once since he was on the same flight.
He's a nice dude.
Cool.
Oh, it does seem kind of nice.
I would like to.
Paul Giamatti.
Paul Giamatti.
Come on.
I think his name is Paul Giamatti.
How are you supposed to pronounce it?
Paul Giamatti.
Who's Paul Giamatti?
Giamatti.
Who's Paul Gio?
Paul Giamatti.
Congrats on finally watching something, Jay.
One down.
They said a hundred ninety nine to go.
Wow.
That's conservative.
Or about nineteen.
Nineteen.
Thank you.
Those are the two films.
You're like.
They said a hundred ninety nine to go.
You're like that much behind the person who's a billion behind.
You know, I think it's just terrible.
There are only a hundred and nineteen.
No, sorry.
Two hundred films.
Okay.
There's two hundred and three films.
So they're still off.
But close.
No, those are the other three films I've seen.
Nobody likes Justice League.
That's the point of release the Snyder cut.
Okay.
This is probably true.
I was trying to think of who likes it.
I was like, actually, no, everyone hates it.
It's fine.
In the C.W. universe.
No, literally no one likes it.
Not a person.
What if they're not people?
What if they're unnatural?
What if they're slithery, sloopy snakes?
I like some movies some can see.
I think sloopy is a better way to describe like really old vegetables.
And not necessarily snakes.
What about cooked carrots?
What about really old snakes?
No.
What about snakes that are like a snoop, a snoop, a snoop, snoop, snoop.
What if the snake's doing that?
A snook.
Have you ever...
Rags, did you ever watch Bamzooki?
Bamzookini?
Bamzooki.
Bang that zookini.
What's Bamzooki?
People in chat represent Bamzooki.
I know what Bamzooki is.
You don't count.
It's probably British only, that is.
Yeah, it's got to be right.
It seems like the kind of thing they wouldn't know.
It was like shitty robot wars.
Fuck you.
Robot wars is best.
Shit, that are battle bots.
They beat that stupid Zooki bam.
Everyone knows the truth.
In the CW universe, Batman has been gone for three years,
and weirdly, Gotham is in a very good state.
The whole city would be under the control of his rogues gallery
within one year Arkham City style.
Yeah, it makes no sense that he's been gone for that long
and nothing's happening, but they do argue in the show
that her coming back and taking his place
is encouraging villains to...
That doesn't really make sense, does it?
You'd think they'd be like, oh, there's a Batman who's back?
Let's now attack.
Can I attack other places?
Fortman.
Think not.
You guys, that's some good input. I appreciate that.
You're welcome.
I'm slowly falling into tiredisms.
Why? It's literally just...
Oh, okay, half past four in the morning.
No, no, it's 40 for me right now.
You fucking blazing it?
Yeah.
Don't blaze it.
Why'd you all get hurt?
Oh, I've just rolled into high noon,
so that has the word high in it.
Yeah, nice one.
Weird.
I'm getting a bochomet as a tattoo.
Thoughts, boys?
A bochomet?
The murder jacket?
Whoa, that's... I think that was racist.
You're not supposed to say it like that.
The dragon?
The dragon thingy?
The monster?
I approve of dragons.
Dragon theme for the dragon lord.
Bahamut.
It's like a...
Dragon monster thingy.
You're getting them? Why?
Why are you getting Bahamut on your Baha butt?
Bahamut.
I don't know.
I don't know. I wouldn't if it was me.
If you feel it's all right, then okay.
But make sure you really want that Bahamut on your body.
You can get tattoos removed now.
No, you can't.
That's science fiction.
You have to shave off your skin with sandpaper instead.
Cut off your arms.
Oh my goodness.
They just...
Cut off your arms and they'll go away.
I see both of them.
Uh...
Rags. Is Exclusively Games dead?
I don't know. I don't think so.
Is it? I don't think so.
Well...
What was the last review you made for Exclusively Games?
It was a while ago. They're on hiatus. They'll start later.
But I don't really know the status of it.
Very well.
Ralph is actually serious about his Joker review.
You don't know that.
He could be planning like a bait and switch reveal thing.
You know, he's in a pretty good position because his review is so bad that he could just randomly be like...
Yeah, I was just fucking with you. It's all good.
The thing is, I would expect at that point for him to reveal some kind of...
Like have some big plan where he releases a second video that puts it all into perspective as a joke.
Because that kind of thing on its own is not a good way to do it already.
Like if he... maybe some of his skits, like there's...
He plays like the full parts and then he's like, this is all actually just bullshit.
And whoever falls for it, blah blah blah.
Or, I was trying to impersonate blah blah blah.
Or...
I was trying to bait Efap to have an Efapening.
Well...
You can't deny it was a successful, satisfying effort.
Whether or not...
It was satisfying.
The video in question was truly legitimate.
But like I said, I'm pretty sure he does actually.
You can't just say that a video isn't legitimate.
Neither can you.
No, I agree. It's a horrible thing to say.
Stop agreeing.
Stop agreeing, God.
Yeah, God does kind of...
He kind of jumps in the bandwagon.
Why do you think about God like he's not in this corner?
Who's God?
I am.
It was just decided.
My God.
Oh, Satan was in here earlier and you got along pretty well.
Yeah, I want bros now.
Like all that shit that we went through.
You know, that's dust under a bridge, man.
Dust under a bridge?
You mean water?
No, it's a dry time.
That's a total-ism.
Dust. It's just dust at the end of the rainbow.
At the end of the rainbow.
Just because it's bad doesn't mean it's bad.
End of the full rain.
So this says Arrowverse is mind AIDS.
Cool.
Yeah.
Oh, no, because at least you get to die from AIDS.
Ralph went full H-Bomberguy with his Joker review.
H-Bomberguy's videos are much better than that.
I was going to say, which H-Bomberguy video would you be referencing for the Joker?
Ralph won.
I guess the Dark Souls one.
Yeah, I guess DS2 counts.
That's actually very apt and consuming, because it's a lot of...
You know what? Yeah, I've just retarded.
Massives like this make me want to study reanimation.
I'd shoot them in the head, bring them back to life, then throw them off Ra's roof.
Also, you missed Jay's Dishonored stream.
He found a good rat.
What would be a good rat?
I'm not going to watch him play video games.
That offends me.
The AIs decided to stop working half way through one of the missions.
So all of the NPCs thought I was a table.
And they all started trying to kill the table.
There's this great clip. I'll show it to you one day.
Very well.
That's really good.
Which member of you family do you think you could go to for help if you had to hide a body?
Also High Rags. You've been a very good boy.
I think my family are too ethical to help me hide a body.
I think they would advise the shit out of me to own up, to go to the police, that sort of thing.
I don't think any of them would help me hide a body.
I'd have to hide it myself.
I'm trying to think if I have like, you know the cliche that everyone has like one...
Any one of my family like that I was bringing to mind.
Everyone has one?
Everyone has one family member who'd help them hide a body.
Everyone has one body. That's true.
What about people without bodies?
They don't count.
Like Snoke, he's a tested baby. He doesn't own the body.
If you cut off your toe, would you have like two bodies?
Yes, try it.
No, one toe would be the body and then the body would be not the body.
What about one toe deto?
Star Wars girls, she said she could hide the body, no problem.
All right.
There you go.
Cool.
How dare you criticize this man, this adult man's opinion on the internet after he insulted you.
Only children engage in behavior like civil discussion.
Well, I'm not just a child. I'm a moronic child.
Also a teenager.
Joker is out on digital but still running in some theaters here in Norway.
It's not even a re-release. It's been going nightly since release.
Oh, that's cool.
Infinite money.
Crisis on infinite nights.
The talk show scene is from Dark Knight Return. The scene is also in the Dark Knight movie.
Very well.
Hi, Moeller and Rags. Hello.
Hello.
Been looking for you to cover this one. Also, check out Above the Storm on Amazon for epic fantasy adventure.
Very well.
Ralph found there was a suspicious amount of women of blackness and SJW midgets in Joker. Reviews are gay.
Well, the detective.
The Joker have a suspiciously amount of dwarves.
Oh, so many dwarves.
Freaking SJW in four hours.
SJW film Joker is because it has the Schulman.
Media surprising you is overrated. A twist is only an improvement if after knowing it, the story makes more sense. Many great stories of obvious plots.
Agreed.
Like too few jobs spread over too many clowns.
Oh, like too much butter spread over too much bread. It's like like too few jobs spread over too much. I get it, I get it.
You should review Chris Stuckman's Joker review.
Chris Stuckman is boring.
Boring and dull.
So I guess that makes us more.
Joker review is good.
No, Jay.
It's bad. Why would you get my hopes up like that?
Why don't you just go hatefully review his short film? I know you want to.
Racist.
You should do you should do high top film short film.
We should check that out. And then because as far as I'm almost certain that's gonna be a lot better than Chris's.
I could believe it is. I could also believe it isn't. I could believe you believe stuff.
He didn't even reply to that. I'm sorry. No, it's true.
I don't see the need to dignify that with a response.
Do you think Jay from Red Letter Media changed his bad take on Joker yet?
And if not, do you think he's upset about Joker getting the most Oscar nominations? Absolutely.
I think he's gonna find that ridiculous.
Because Todd Phillips is not a real movie maker. That's his reasoning.
And if you think he is, you're probably a teenager. Bucky teenagers everywhere.
Fourteen. Twenty.
God damn it. He escaped the teenager phase.
It's a mag, not a clip, literature devil.
Oh my God. Did he call it a mag? He did call a mag a clip. He was incorrect.
What was he referencing?
I forget what, but I can't remember that he did. I wanted to say something, but I couldn't.
Couldn't because you're a coward.
I didn't tell Satan how guns work.
Watch Seven Psychopaths, I assume. Seven Psychos? Well written, but didn't like it was strange.
While in Bruges again, or watched in Bruges again and loved it. Well written dialogue, tragic, funny, also high rags.
There are two films that are gonna make rags much eventually too. We're getting there. There's a lot of films, as you can tell.
Randolph visited Arthur not to check up on him. He visited him to cover his ass for giving him the gun. Completely selfish, which is probably why he's dead.
Um, I think that makes sense. I would need to look at the specific dialogue in the scene, but he is concerned that they're looking for a killer clown who's shooting people, and he knows he has a gun, and it's his gun.
But, um, yeah, it's, uh, the other guy was definitely there because he was a nice-tism.
Uh, his video is not real, it's just a delusion. Oh, we can say the whole video was a dream.
It was a dreamlike experience.
Uh, Ralph is just a snob who thinks anyone, anything less than art, film, movies that win awards in Cannes are junk.
Dialing.
Uh, have you seen the Elvis the Alien TROS video? He mentions you a couple times. I have. It's, um, it's-
We should have him on Efap one of these days.
We should invite him if we ever cover, like, a Joker video by Ralph, we should invite him to come.
I will invite him on this, not this stream. Um, this stream as in Efap is a stream.
You wouldn't invite him to this stream, would you?
No, uh, but I will invite him in future, for sure, and we will discuss things. But yeah, his video was, uh, what I would call fine.
Um, I agree.
Well, I can't believe you'd say that with him on the stream.
But, uh, yeah, it was, it was, uh, the, the, the, the video, like, tries to cover the Twitter drama, but then also just sort of quickly reviews the Star Wars movies, sequel trilogy, uh,
you know, like, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's fine. Like, it's just a, it's sort of like a brief overview, very chill, doesn't say a huge amount. It's any controversial. It just sort of says, like,
more as Twittering with people who are Twittering back, blah, blah, blah. Fine. Um, why do people have the hottest fucking takes about Joker? Holy shit. Anyways, hi, Rags.
Hello.
And yeah, I have no idea, honestly. Um, Joker just brings it out of people like TLJ did.
What other stuff has done that?
Uh, Godzilla, who'd agree?
Yes. That's insane. You know, I just whispered the TNG theme and oh my God. And then I clicked the next button on Imgur. And it's a fucking the Star Trek, the next generation meme. I'm not even, I'm not even shitting you. Oh my goodness gracious. I didn't, that's, oh my God.
How did they know? How did they know?
Stop.
Fuck. Oh my goodness. Oh my God. Chances that happening are low.
It's the chances of seven.
There's a chance of two in there, like three maybe.
Another Joker take. Keep going, you massives. Also, hi Rags.
How?
Drunk Rags sounds like Travis from Taxi Driver.
Salaam alaikum, drunk ala Rags.
Oh, hi.
Rags has been at the fermented rhino milk. Yeah, there's a good chance of that.
Hi Rags, please rate human, cat girl style, ears and tail and throw in full animal from most to least sexy and then rate each for sexiness on a one to 10 scale.
Okay, let's take a look at that in text form.
Hi Rags. I'm sorry about that. Hi Rags, please rate human, cat girl style, ears and tail and throw in full animal from most to least sexy and then rate each for sexiness on one to 10 scale.
What am I reading?
Because it's like just the ears alone.
I'm guessing that it's like human ears, not very sexy. Sorry.
I think it means them as a whole.
What?
So like your four categories are full human, full animal.
Oh, full human. They can be, they can be very sexy. They can also be very not sexy. They can be everywhere from hideous to beautiful.
Cat girl style, ears and tail. I need examples because we're just talking conceptually here because conceptually, I don't have a problem with any of this stuff.
Imagine it's the same person and they're morphing from thing to thing.
Oh, like an Animorphs book cover?
That person is Poe Dameron.
What animal would he be?
I don't even know what he'd be. I think about it.
He would be a human.
Any examples, not just like the idea.
Poe Dameron is a Pima.
It's almost like saying on a scale of one to 10, rate a hot girl. You know, it's like.
I'm being more specific.
Wait, who? Poe Dameron.
As? Puma.
I think, I think a panther kind of fits him a Puma panther.
You know, like a big cat thingy.
You know, nothing gay, but just like, you know, I think I got to fit some. I got to fit some.
Like Bagheera.
Big ear.
Is that it? Did you do it?
Big ear, raw.
Yeah.
Done. Did you do it?
Someone's like, Rags, those Animorphs? Yeah, I love them even more now.
He's like, you.
You're a weird one.
Did you do it? Is that it?
I'm sorry.
I'm I'm I guess I'm not really like capable of doing it without it.
Like I said, this is kind of asking me like, rate a girl, but with blonde hair now with brown hair now with black hair.
Out of scale of one to 10.
I'm like, Oh man, I don't know.
All right.
Someone draw Poe Dameron and the various stages of Puma.
There's an Animorph going from Poe Dameron to just fucking just fully a Puma.
It'll be helpful for when he assaults death stars on the top, he could run off the top of them.
Yeah.
Joker is clearly a ripoff of 1966 Batman series, which stars Cesar Romero as Joker, bloody, unoriginal copycats.
I knew it.
Ass hunter is how rags learned he was bisexual because he would intentionally lose the game.
Oh, no, I was afraid at that time.
I was afraid of being ass raped by homosexuals in the forest.
It's only natural.
I was like, Oh my goodness, isn't that like unsanitary?
Like, I don't know where that penis has been.
It's probably been fucking all the other homosexuals in the forest.
It's got an audience of bums.
F for Jimmy Hoffa died for our sins.
Fuck.
Jimmy Hoffa.
Afghanistan War, obviously a ripoff of the Vietnam War.
I agree.
I watched just rights Hobbit videos, not exactly sure why Wolf thought they were good.
He contradicts himself in the video or ignores scenes.
I guess I haven't seen him.
Memories of butter.
Memories.
We made a cursed brew of food in Don air sauce.
OK.
Like Al Pacino in heat.
Shut up, Ralph.
Sit down.
Oh, God.
Don't need to be so violent.
Ralph can continue speaking.
I just hope that he doesn't speak in the same way.
You know, can continue speaking, but should he?
That's that's a philosophical question.
Big idiots will have to be consulted.
If we all watch a stream with E.R. in it, doesn't that everyone mean watching a Nazism?
Yes.
The world Nazis.
You didn't ask for it.
You didn't want it, but it is.
Rags, remember to stick to our community guidelines.
Like glue.
Yes.
I shall stick to them.
Why would you include uninteresting characters if you can just choose to
included interesting characters?
Right.
You don't need to flesh out every character for characters.
Then flushing them out will be unnecessary.
Also.
This is a malformed question.
It's like what makes an interesting character when they're boring people in this
world, as in like to populate your universe, you would have boring people.
Does that make them as in like monotonous or lame?
I don't know.
Just.
I don't understand the question.
Also, I find the characters interesting in Joker.
Drunk doggo and Satan in a religious stream.
Hashtag kick J.
What is gracious?
You're being kicked because this is a religious stream and you're you're getting
in the way of the religion.
But I love all religions.
Like nepotism.
Incest.
I don't think that's a religion.
Is incest your religion?
Yes.
It is for some people.
My only autism.
I mean, religions can be founded by pedophile.
Sure. Why not?
Peditism.
Those are the three religions, right?
Nepotism, incest and narcolepsy.
Yes.
Suspicious amounts of women of color and dwarves, lol.
Seriously, it's DC fanboys who hate this.
Never once brought up Batman reviewing this either.
Yeah.
I mean, some people just can't resist.
Speaking of Oscar nominations, watch Jojo Rabbit, you massive.
Now, I know we had mentioned it by now.
Well,
metal, please watch it.
It's got funny.
We gave it a thumb up the bum bum.
Watch it next week.
But next week starts tomorrow.
Yeah, but next week, like Friday, when I'm driving home on the train, I have a lot of time to watch a movie.
Drunk as fuck, yet no talk of dick.
I is disappoint rags.
Well, you know, quick, quick, quick, dick.
I love it.
Better than the triangle.
Jar Jar Binks.
Jar Jar Binks.
What do you call audio pops objectively bad?
Wait, what you call audio pops objectively bad?
So like, if you just cut into like a background sound instead of like fading in, it can be jarring and distracting.
Not necessarily bad every time, especially when you're being used to a strong effect, I suppose.
I'm watching 59.
To answer your questions about trailers, I often watch Swatoor's ones because it's possible to do enough Star Wars without destroying the originals.
Yeah, I don't begrudge anyone for returning to trailers, but wasn't the thing I was responding to someone being like, I often watch the trailers for like, what movie was it?
Yeah, it was Joker.
It was Jeb Nichols talking about how she thoroughly enjoys Joker's trailer, but she doesn't like the film.
And I found it weird as hell.
The turn.
Well, go drunk rags your home.
Also, hi, everyone.
I am. I am.
I've been home all day.
Fuck home.
You understand why I'll never watch Ralph with this being my first impression when he says stupidity like rated our movie is made for 14 year olds.
I mean, it's up to you.
It's up to you.
I would begrudge anybody for being like, I don't want to watch another one.
It's like, yeah, that's fine.
Not a great impression.
Sure.
I finally watched Joker and thus the effects on this subject.
So regarding rags is probably use of an apostrophe comment from last year.
He's wrong.
I mainly go here.
Yeah, I mainly go for fashion over function in fantasy.
I don't understand how that's.
I don't get it.
I thought my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a fun pair of pull.
Good.
And go.
And drum.
Billy and Cecilia.
Go, go, go.
Bill Joe.
Kirkens.
Oh, Bill Joe.
Kirkens is Welsh.
Bill Bill Jurgens.
Also, you still have yet to watch Hardcore Henry.
You dumbos.
One day.
One day.
I watched Hardcore Henry a long time ago.
Fire.
Okay.
That one Wall Street guy was genuinely terrifying.
Uh, in Joker?
Or are we talking about someone else?
Don't know.
Yeah, which one?
Um, I'm doing a review of the Hobbit series.
Holy shit.
I understand how much work you do now.
Fourteen K words and I don't like a single one in my first recording.
I sound like shit.
How do you do it?
Loads of redrafting.
Never had degree drafting.
Yeah.
It never ends.
There is no video.
It's about the journey, not the destination.
The key is to die and lay in your grave with a copy of the perfect video that no one has ever seen except yourself.
Then you will have one.
I was present for the birth of the Bilbo meme.
I have seen many forms of wolf.
I've seen the banishment of Jared to the void.
The good rat looking at women, the dawn rhino milk.
He's been there, man.
Been there.
Rags, why are you laughing?
Something funny, asshole.
I get it.
That's not a thing people say.
If this video is deliberately bad, is this video then the spiritual successor to Quentin Review's Citizen Kane video?
It's supposed to be Alfred.
Kinda?
I'm not going to say it's not.
Kinda?
Kinda?
First, Efap Super Chat, you massive.
Any plans for Film Gob to be a guest in the future?
He's a big DCEU fan, would make for a great discussion slash debate.
Uh, no reason to have anything against it?
I don't know anything about him personally.
I've seen it all.
And now I have arrived to Efap up to date after watching every single episode in its entirety.
Despite being here to see its birth, I was absent for a very long time.
Thank you for the Tisms long man and the mighty massives of the toxic brood.
Hi Rags.
Hello.
Kick J.
Well, he's already kicked, you see.
The mute, he's kicked.
He kicked himself because he's hungry.
Thank you for the 1.2 billion hours of entertainment.
Now please, play Akbar's theme.
That would be Ocean Man.
So that's one of the many claims that got hit with the, with the, the copyrightism video.
Ocean Man took it down.
Well.
Down, but not quite forgotten.
Um, hi Mauler.
Hello.
I really liked RTMM, but this video was really bad.
You should check the Sardana cast with the cover Joker.
It's really tis me.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello.
So I just went to go get food.
I was making like a nice wrap, right?
Because I like that.
Nice and easy to make.
Word.
You were on me.
Yeah.
I was putting cream cheese in it.
That's all right.
Only white people put cream cheese in the right.
Yeah, I'm fine with that.
Um,
and my laundry basket was out because my, you know, my, my, uh, washer was in my kitchen.
It's getting wider and wider.
Um, as, um, as my laundry basket was out with laundry in it.
My washer, which is on my kit, like, so it's, which is in my kitchen.
And then I, some of the cream cheese got stuck to the knife.
So I was like shaking the knife to get it off the cream, off the, off the knife.
Instead of going down into the, into the wrap, it went up and like landed in my laundry basket and my laundry.
Well, surely it only like, what'd you do?
I have to check it out.
How does your laundry taste?
I like cheesy.
Cheesy.
Like discount Philadelphia.
I don't know if they're going to know that.
We have Philadelphia over here.
They don't.
I knew that.
Don't.
When I, when I said they, I meant chat.
Because chat mostly just from one place.
I know this.
Do you like Philadelphia?
Um, I love drunk rags, also high regs.
Oh, hello.
Senpai rags, please notice my boner density.
Your boner density is most impressive.
Rags, who's your dealer?
My dealer?
I guess you'd be a dealer.
I, I don't know.
Mazda.
I guess.
Um, holy crap.
Rags had like one beer and he's totally smashed.
He's like a college chick.
Yeah, it was like two beers.
Fucking hell.
Yeah, I don't even know, actually.
Minimum three, minimum three.
And I had one some other time.
I mean, I, I'm, I'm jealous in a way because like three beers.
I'd need like fucking 12 beers before I'd be getting drunk.
That's insane.
I don't understand.
No, you're the weird one.
I've been drinking this whole night now.
Rags, how heavy are you?
Seven.
I'm not that heavy.
I'm, I'm pretty normal weighted, I guess.
Probably heavier than me.
Maybe.
Probably.
You look like a fucking stick with a big nose.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
That's offensive.
You're like mooper.
He's like a twig.
Mooper.
Come on, looper.
I weigh 17 kilograms.
What, what weird measurement would you like it in?
Let me zoom on your ugly face.
Oh my God.
He nailed us.
We fucking got wrecked.
Got wrecked.
Hey, hey.
Um, yes.
Fuck.
You fuck.
What happened?
Did something bite off your toes?
Forget.
Don't worry.
Don't proceed.
Were you going to say something and then you were like, fuck, I've forgotten.
Is that what happened?
Kind of.
All right.
Well, I mean, that's, that's fair chat.
If you remember what Rags is going to say, let us know.
I think you said it.
You said I fuck.
Oh, sorry.
Right.
Yeah.
It's a joke.
Fuck.
All right.
Drunk.
Fuck.
Um, I can get a boner.
Good.
Have you just confirmed this?
No, no.
I knew I like, I knew.
I think this whole time it just sounded like going, oh, I can.
Well, you know, Rags, you can do whatever he wants while he's fapping.
You know,
They get the old, the old whiskey deck.
Flipping and flopping.
I don't like liquor.
Maybe it's a liquor thing.
Oh boy.
This is going to be a long night out of curiosity.
More.
What editing software do you use to make your videos?
Greetings from Cardiff.
Hello.
That would be Sony Vegas.
16 is what I currently use.
You're using 16.
I'm using 15.
You're in the fucking past.
Aren't you?
Grow up.
God.
Oh, wait.
Future.
I guess it's true.
I've said we were teens.
I'm using 11.
Oh.
Which isn't a teen.
It makes sense.
He's like the youngest one here.
Uh, in rag speak.
Oh my God.
An efap stream.
I get to catch live.
Praise the dawn.
Also high regs.
Hello.
You gave classes, but no races.
I guess so.
I'm an elf.
I am a Gandalf.
I want to be an orc, but I don't feel like I fully represent an orc very well physically.
I think I'm closer to an elf.
What makes you say that?
I'd say you're more like a goblin.
My size and shape.
You're kind of goblin-like.
Goblin-ish, yeah.
You're kind of like a goblin.
Press 1 in chat for Jay to be a goblin.
You're kind of like a goblin, Jay.
Like a good goblin.
Oh, cheers, man.
You're one of the, you're like the tutorial goblin.
It's like, push forward on the stick to go forward.
The first one in chat is from rag.
Does, does anyone remember, um, like an old animated kid movie called The Princess and the Goblins?
Anyone here?
No, no, this is vaguely familiar, honestly.
Yeah.
So the thing is like the goblins invaded and everything, but their weakness was singing.
If you sang, then the goblins would cover their ears and like, ah, I hate this.
It's terrible.
And they'd run away.
So in chat, just confirm that, confirm that this was a thing.
I need to know that I wasn't the only one who knows this because I don't know if this was like popular or not.
The Princess and the Goblins?
Someone says, yes, they remember.
There we go.
Yeah, man.
Star Wars girl says, yeah, uh, yeah.
Man.
Would Jay have been one of those goblins or are they two?
There was like a fucking goblin king and he had red hair and fucking asshole.
Oh, that does sound like me.
Wow, I gotta Google it.
Google it.
Oh, my God.
Rags has had one millilite and he's incoherent.
What a lightweight.
Yes, that's what he looked like.
He was a fucking asshole.
I mean, I can see how you would say that looks like Jay, but it's still kind of harsh to the goblin.
Oh, my goodness.
Look at the look at these.
Look at these characters.
I can't.
I can't.
I haven't seen this in years.
Well, look at it.
Look at their faces.
Look at all their faces.
Oh, he has pink hair in that one.
I nearly made my hair pink once, but then I didn't.
This is such a blast from the past.
Jeez.
Anyway, move on.
I was just taking a trip.
As ma'am.
Nostalgia Street.
Hail hate mongers.
How goes the objectivity war?
So, you know, just fine.
Just fine.
Can't just say seven to everything.
That's illegal.
Seven.
You just said seven to you saying you can't say seven to everything.
What are you going to do about that?
Jay?
Well, that wasn't everything, was it?
So fuck you.
Fucking idiot.
That's not what I said.
You deaf goblin.
Six.
That's illegal.
No.
I don't know.
I installed Lego Star Wars.
No, I have.
Good.
Well, because I want to review it.
Can we have an Ewatch hentai now?
Oh, no.
I'm getting my screen.
This is a weird one.
It says, Hey, Ralph, it's me, Joker.
Can't punt the gun.
Okay.
I agree with that.
I guess.
Rags is like the kid in high school that comes to the party,
drinks one beer and does a swan dive off the roof into the pool,
then drunk dials 911 and passes out in the gutter out front.
It's not true.
It's not true.
Don't say that.
Your streams are always listed, you Nazis.
No, they're not.
They're always unlisted.
All of them are unlisted.
This should be the bullet channel, in which case they're supposed to be listed.
They're supposed to be listed.
And the active streams are totally supposed to be listed.
That makes the sense.
I think.
Did any of you guys watch Tolkien?
No Oscar nominations, but still a great and accurate telling of J.R.
R's life.
Well, I think I'm pretty sure the Tolkien estate like disavowed that film or
something.
Someone asks what Wolf thinks of it and he answers that question in the video
we recorded.
So when that's out, you will get your answer because me and Rags don't know
fucking much of anything about that movie.
Every movie has dreamlike logic.
Erase ahead and marriage story are equally dreamlike.
This review has nightmare like logic.
I agree.
Is King Emperor Penguin on your list of potential future guests?
His military analysis of films from the Hobbit to the Star Wars films are
awesome.
I don't think he is, but it's always open.
What's abilities?
Rags plus three beers equals crying face, laughing face.
Go to bed Rags.
No.
Jay just died because you suggested that Rags go to bed.
Oh my God, Jay.
Did you how much cream cheese did you drop?
All of it.
Jay, just be honest.
I think he's dead.
Died.
Long.
Don't live, Jay.
He did the final kick.
Hey, Moolah, why are you so much gayer than Rag?
I mean, you just sometimes you can't hide it.
What can I say?
Is Rags hamming it up or is he on the Alcatisms?
I don't feel like I'm I feel I feel like it's hammy.
You've insulted Rags on her.
Do.
Hi, Rags.
Have another beer, please.
No, I really can't.
Rags is the girl at the party that drinks one beer and then continuously vomits into the toilet as you hold her head back and say it'll be all right, honey.
It's not true.
It's not true.
In Maleficent 2, there's a gas chamber seed.
The fairies equal metaphor for the Jews responsible for all the problems.
There is noble pixie doing war crime experiments on his kind.
What the fuck, Disney?
I know.
Disney or weird?
What can I say?
Why can't I just arrive back to you?
You've missed it, Jay.
I can't just repeat a super chat.
Jesus Christ.
What is this?
I'm sorry.
Remember to check Ralph for weapons before you let him on.
Oh, yeah, we'll get Robert De Niro to do it.
He's a little like doorman.
Love the drunk doggo.
Drink, Rags, drink.
Yum, yum, yum.
Drink, drink, drink.
Because when I was when I had that meetup with top hats and everything in Houston, man, we had a great time.
It was great.
We had fun and everything went really well.
It was great.
I'm good to hang out with.
I'm a good guy to hang out with.
Well, I mean, as long as you have like one or two beers, you probably are great to hang out with.
No, I had like, no, no, I had like four big ones, right?
Whoa.
You know?
No.
Shut the fuck up.
Whoa.
And we had a we had a great time.
And I was we had it was really good.
And whoa.
It was fine.
Fuck I grew up in the hotel room.
Oh, no, it wasn't a good time at all.
Well, not not the end.
But then you didn't get it over with.
And you're like, man, I feel great.
Love all your videos.
It's really taught me to be critical of films regardless of whether or not I enjoy them.
And I appreciate good film so much more now.
Has anyone seen 1917 and any thoughts?
I've seen it already.
Hmm.
Yeah, we we've we've we have talked about it.
It's very good.
It's very good.
Go see it.
Hey, Mueller.
Just wanted to say, don't let the Twitter trolls get to you.
Small minded people will always be fearful of logic.
And always remember, Twitter is not real life.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
Yes, Twitter is definitely not real life.
There are real people on there, I suppose.
But there's also fake people.
I shall see you fellows later.
All right.
Goodbye.
I love every time Rags says, oh, my God.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello.
Also, Mueller.
What is your favorite scene from Tommy Wiseau's The Room?
Why do I have to choose?
That's not fair.
The whole thing is a masterpiece.
And I don't want to go.
I guess I kind of avoid probably the shop scene just because there's so much to talk about in terms of its construction.
Just that that rampant, horrifying audio editing as well as just the the entire setup.
The whole thing is wonderful in terms of talking about.
But that, you know, you got so much to choose from.
So much to choose from.
In fact, I should probably rewatch that film because it's a wonderful The Room.
Oh, so good.
Such an excellent film.
I don't even know if we could do it for eFap movies because it's been watched by like everybody.
You know what I mean?
Good dog.
Dog, Satan, Rhino and Bearded Pepe.
Slender Man in a Gas Mask.
At this point, this podcast could be one of the all-universes TV and Rick and Morty.
I can believe it.
I heard they're doing three Joker origin movies.
What?
No way.
That's your liar.
Three origin movies?
Origin.
That's how you're supposed to pronounce that.
Like orange.
Shut up.
Oh.
I took Joker shooting De Niro.
It was him embracing who he really is.
Joker gives up on people and chooses to be just as awful as he perceives the others.
I think that's a fair assessment.
Clone Wars is objectively better than the sequel trilogy.
Ahsoka is also one of the best Star Wars characters.
Shame she's dead now.
It makes me sad.
Um, yeah.
Doors haven't really gone.
Yeah, she can just come back.
Clone it.
In fact, the best way to get someone to come back right now is probably just blow them up on a Death Star because that is like a guarantee.
Andrew Clavin said Joker was a better taxi driver.
Dun, dun, dun.
Better taxi driver.
They're too different for me to say.
Like one is a better that one than the other one, you know?
But okay.
Is Cancer Girl's Pussy Smooth?
At least they spelled it with dollar signs, but that almost wakes you with...
Cancer Girl?
Well, because you're selling that purse.
Yeah, so you're putting the purse on the market, as they say.
Disgusting.
Uh, yeah.
Weird super chat, but all right.
I'm surprised that got through, uh, the checks.
Interesting.
Yeah, spelling, spelling, selling, selling pussy with dollar signs.
Spelling pussy with dollar signs doesn't seem like...
I'm sorry, what?
You just said like four times and I didn't understand any of them.
Spelling pussy with dollar signs doesn't seem like it would get...
Spelling pussy with dollar signs.
Doesn't seem like a way to get it through because it seems like such an obvious way to do it.
Mm-hmm.
Yes.
It's like, hey, this thing looks exactly like an ass.
Let's use...
I agree.
Well, I'm sure whatever he was trying to say was important.
It's probably really sexy.
Wait, am I still cutting out?
No, we got all of that.
Yeah, every part of it.
And we agree.
It does not stand on its own as a drama.
Awful.
I guess the person's just reviewing that statement.
You can't put apostrophes there.
You tell them, Ragsizzizzizzizz.
Ralph's a tool, the end.
A good story.
I was invested in the characters.
Happy efapping, lads.
Love you all.
Love you too, sir.
Rah, get your tallest roof.
Making it 100 stories taller, then Chuck Ralph into the same abyss that Ryan Johnson chucked JJ's notes into.
Chuck Ralph.
Sounds like a character in a movie.
Ralph Chuckman?
Chuck Ralphman?
Ralph Chuckman.
Chuck Ralph.
I miss Wolf.
He'd tear this ewok a new brown table.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my god, I actually managed to be around for a live efap.
Keep on fapping, you magnificent bastards.
Keep on fapping.
You know what?
I think we might just do that.
I can only rap three white women or else I'll be racist.
I guess.
Where?
Rap.
Rap three.
What does that mean?
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm curious.
W-R-A-P?
No.
R-A-T.
P-E-3.
You can't give people as gifts.
You have to buy them.
Yes.
This video reminds me so much of the PK Russell Has Been Hotel video.
No actual arguments, just a pretentious asshole saying it's juvenile and childish.
Well, he would know better than you because he likes Citizen Kane.
Oh my god.
They didn't even find it boring.
Well, only a moron would find that boring.
Yeah, not him.
3.5 stars for 1917.
Heresy.
Raw.
Forget the roof.
Stamp him into a nuke and then launch it at the black hole.
Oh wow.
Wait, I'd check that out if they made like a rendition of it.
Pretty cool.
Explode it right before it hits the black hole just to see what things happen.
All the lights.
www.autismspeaks.org.
Okay.
Yeah, have you ever heard an autistic person talk?
That's racist.
Jay's right there, dude.
Wow.
I got him.
Mola, where should I go to send a meme?
A post office?
What?
Try Twitter, the subreddit, the Discord.
Hopefully I will catch it in and among those things.
I don't catch everything, I'm afraid.
Hi Rags.
Off to see 1917 and hoping it's good.
I'm sorry.
I meant to say hello.
Minute one.
Determining the objective values and flaws inherent in cinema and debate.
Just discuss subjective feelings based on factual evidence.
Minute two.
Is it possible to pee while fapping?
God, I love you.
That's the kind of discussion that's required to really crack the proverbial nut of philosophy
and understanding nature.
That's how you practice that smooth stroke and you start pissing in the toilet.
If you are in that.
That's a boring place to piss.
But you're not pissing in the toilet.
No.
Like, go outside.
I don't piss where I live.
I don't nasty.
But you can do that.
And you can just go for it.
But you can't get a drop outside of the toilet.
Ralph is friendly with Quentin, aka the personification of the communist work ethic.
It makes sense that Ralph would make such a lazy video and also snipe at you in such a passive aggressive way.
Oh my god.
I'm willing to not assume anything.
I'm sure that ending was just funsies.
Mooper is a well-realized multi-dimensional character.
Is Mooper a short man?
Mm-hmm.
Shotman bad.
Hi, Rags.
How much have you had to drink this stream?
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.
Um, let me look.
I don't want to say.
2000 What a Space Odyssey is a mostly boring film.
So much of that film is just dragged out scenes.
Howl and beyond is where the interesting things happen.
No, you're just dumb.
You think it's boring.
I have it on good authority from Ralph, the movie man.
What a moron.
He couldn't find a Space Odyssey.
Fucking moron.
Yeah, Ron.
I watched Citizen Kane three times and I wasn't bored.
This means I have the uber-smartisms, right?
Bow before me, peasants.
Also, lechaim drunk rags.
Hello.
But Jeez, you look like...
Well, I mean, like, I mean, not like in a looky way, but you seem like a smart man.
Yes.
Uh, two.
I are a dumb.
Okay.
Never saw 2001.
What happens?
It's about how a series of apes attack a spaceship and they eventually create an AI.
Yes.
Rise of the Planet of the Howl.
Yes.
Also, just a fun side bit.
I can't wait for the eFav discussion about the prequels.
I think that you guys will gain a new appreciation for them.
Boom, boom, boom.
It's possible.
I'm sorry, Jay.
I'm afraid you can't have that opinion.
Halbus Beginnius, a.k.a. Sams is in Smash.
He is in Smash, and he's good.
How to deconstruct your channel in one video.
Yeah, well, I mean, he'll be fine, but he probably pissed off a couple people, for sure.
Um, love you guys.
You're really in...
What was that, Rags?
What the fuck?
What?
I said one or two.
Two.
Is that how many you've had to drink?
It is not.
Oh, that's a lie, Jay.
How could you possibly imply such lies?
That's fucked up.
Probably three.
Uh, love you guys.
You've really inspired me to improve my writing.
Hi, Mola.
Hi, Rag.
Hello.
And then it just says Jay.
Oh, I will respond in turn by not saying anything.
Very well.
Yes.
Uh, have Rag.
Very well.
Have Rag Sauron.
I guess, oh, I guess it's the same, like Sauron have Rags.
I don't know.
I've never met, I've never met Sauron.
We've never even spoken in a casual way online.
I guess he's busy running his army, being an eyeball.
Busy being an eye.
being an eye it's a lot of work you laugh now but my pop said Joker was
boring oh your pop is a more no way you're probably allowed to say that one's
boring because that's a bad oh yeah if you say the Joker is boring it means
you're really smart because you picked up on the fact that it is definitely
boring well there's other things that you think might be boring they're not
2001 Space Odyssey it's it's basically it's just action thriller all the way
through just an on-stop thrill ride it's a rollercoaster of intensity also J is
God neat yeah didn't you know that what's the difference between aluminum
and aluminium
pronunciation hmm aluminum not allow minium both of those sound weird
molar pronounced terra hort pronounced terra hort okay Indiana era hort Indiana
terra hort never saw King of comedy what happens so it's medieval it's about the
it's like a bunch of sort of groups of different tribes trying to dominate and
it's a comedy obviously and the guy uses like telling jokes and fucking around
people to become the king the halfway through the film he loses it and then by
the end they realized that they don't need a king they realized at the end of
the film that the real comedy was friends they made along the way there
you go aluminium was the original way it was written down by the discoverer but
the science sickles thought of it sounded dumb so they added an eye the
Americans adopted it to use less ink to use less ink I okay I I don't think
that I buy that you don't have to buy it it's like let's change the name of an
element to save a little money on ink is like I don't know it sounds like
something you guys would do like oh let's have lots of slaves and then have
a war to figure out whether a slavery is bad and I and they did that whole
independence thing which was pretty rude I am Oh yeah that lead was short so you
could write a lot and use it for your war yeah
all right then tip-tip tip-tip this this says he's something in hammering it
kind of looks like a camera mo I'm not sure camera he's hammering coming
books that came with the with this this was meant to be sent to you right it's
the princess and the goblin that's from that starless girl is that the oh my
goodness is that the record I suppose it it do the princess and the goblin that
princess and the goblin so I don't it's I can't tell for scale I don't know how
bigger hands are I is that like a DVD release or is that the the record you
put it on your record player and you can listen to this princess man big hand if
that's a record judging by all those books in the background it's probably a
book a book has some fucking bullshit it says the fully animated feature film if
you put that on a book that kids gonna buy that and open it up and be like what
the shit is it a film fuck you this is I would like to
and the cock goblin there's also bullshit what was the
remind me of the thing why don't we have to remind you all the time you said
something like this the thing about this car like what was the quote you know I'm
thinking about it one of them has to be as a result of the fucking trimming
because that's this it's just no way like nobody would leave that in that's
just the only way he'd leave that is a book the book says it's a film though
who do you trust the book of a human I can't believe that book lied to me a
book lad takes a lot of fucking nerve for a book to lie to me that's a pretty
pretty bold-ass book for a thing within match distance and I do happy Australia
Day happy Australia Day if you like bad movies you're a bad person and you
should feel bad oh man my bad movie I like is X-men the last stand when
Wolverine kicks the dude in the balls and says grow those back classic so
silly but yeah hmm speak more in French please merci
Oh
all right right ragu I will I will ask the question again then I can I'll get
you the correct answer okay yeah oh yes my lair is tapping in the discard I'll
ask the question comment eat up a jim a pal rag is nailed it there you go we
spoke French we did it why are we back to French is this for la fromage no this
is left for my oh liquidy is Italian you hack that's like your opinion spaghetti
if you like bad quality things you're a deep sheet a deep sheet I would have
preferred that to be deep sheave Ratatouille has a better script and
world-building than The Last Jedi I agree there are about 70 different cheese
types in France so our cook will have the quite the assortment assortment to
choose from also high rafts what yeah I ran rats rats rafts well I think it's
supposed to be a comment on like Ralph but it wouldn't have called it high
Ralph but no the F is just next to the G I think that's what happened no it's
not an F's a pH oh oh yeah that's probably about Ralph rafts yeah all right
they don't all this day I always thought Ralph was pretentious now I know it for
sure what's your favorite portrayal of Bruce Wayne slash Batman mines David
Mazuz the kid in Gotham I really liked Ben Affleck I just wanted him to have
better scripts I think my favorite probably Michael Keaton though my coach
meeting yeah can I say like the 2004 the Batman because everyone off 2004 is the
Batman yeah it was like a cartoon oh okay it's really fun I love that show I
like Adam West up to you Batman Adam West DC has dog welder man a man whose
power is to weld dogs to people's faces is that true it's a fairy there's lots
of ways you can use that power dog welder new earth oh my god
dog well there was a number of section 8 while the team was on high at the dog
welder spent his time trapping and killing dogs in alleyways oh my god
help fight Marcia's henchman dog well there was a vaporizing killed with
section 8 fought too many angled ones what the fuck
hug welder man just called dog welder we get a dog welder in Steve we need
that movie in the Joker universe the second part of the super chest is the
Joker sequel should be a character study of dog welder man I props to you guys
for getting through this shit fuck of a video except you Jay a little to the
defense fund to help Jay keep safe from them assassins what I want to point out
that one of the most popular manga anime right now is Boku no hero academia my
hero academia this show pretty much single-handedly revived the superhero
genre for the weeb community ooh weebs that's pronounced webs but yeah web is
wabs kick loud rhino milk boy oh well do you have the word wabs where you are I
don't think so I don't want to chat does anyone in chat not labs means they all
said no this guy is actually pissing me off fuck my TROS video I'm gonna make a
response to this what an absolute knuckle-dragging moron how did anyone
find quality of this oh my god I mean it was pretty funny likes to dislike it was
funny that well this is the thing he has a lot of good faith like I think the
loads of people this is okay but I'm not judging I think a lot of people when he
releases a video will hit like and then watch it and that's fine but the more if
he was to release like five of these in a row that would probably destroy his
channel it was of credibility but I'm sure anyone well yeah obviously I guess
that applies to anyone I'm saying it would actually probably take the brand
like if Bob did that then Bob yeah that's what Bob does I was gonna say
like he's got really good he's got a good standing as far as I know so he
just needs to not do that again oh did you see that did you see Sean telling
Bob to shut up I did I liked I think I retweeted that I thought it was funny as
hell the fact that he said a ball but he would question
yeah don't it I passed out hi rags hello rags when is your next video coming out
Oh too long all right well done that means you have you say good things is it any
wonder why Sedona cast is losing viewers and if app is gaining viewers why am I
should ditch the chuds and hang out with the cool kids as far as I know they do
it fine like kids and they don't do a live version maybe they would get more
engagement if they did I don't know but um I'm sure they're doing fine is it
realistic excited it's like probably like an hour of super chats left well you
don't you don't have to stay I will I can reveal that to you if you would really
like to know I mean I'm just asking if it's gonna take super long because I'm
I'm pretty tired to be honest um of the super chance of this stream could be just
over an hour yeah I'm not gonna stay up another hour very well would you like to leave now's
yeah I shall peace out and go to the beds and before you go bait your video that you're
totally making right now and not just baiting I'm not baiting I'm actually doing the video
yeah okay yeah shop oh my god start with the visuals uh I have no idea how long that's gonna
take me because I have no idea what I'm doing so it's gonna be great uh
yeah uh it's gonna be on the channel that's not that doesn't exist yet it's gonna be on a whole
new channel there was some there's some people were like is he gonna upload it on twitch or youtube
yeah people were asking you to upload on twitch you can't well you can technically do I'm actually
I'm not even sure if you can I just straight up upload on there now but what you can do
because I think you should probably do it you may as well like stream the video once you've made it
and then uh obviously as long as it's good for copyright and then you can highlight it as a big
chunk right uh yeah I can do that well it will be on your twitch channel but also put it on
youtube because that would be stupid absolutely yeah that's that's that's that sounds good to me
but yeah thank you for joining us metal tism sure always and I'll catch you I'll probably catch you
tomorrow uh we can yeah probably we can we can edit together because I'm currently editing too
yeah sounds good I shall probably still be uh idle and chat and just follow Stephen like that or
something that's a normal place to fall asleep yeah it's not that weird honestly see y'all around
idiot moron teenager got him 14 racist thomas as he dies son I want you to dress up as a bat and
beat up that crazy clown guy he's a turd all right see that's the sequel bait was you guys missed the
line what does it mean um I swear to god they had the expectation that in the middle of this
story that batman would jump out of nowhere and beat him to death you don't know that couldn't
happen you don't know yeah superhero movie Ralph somewhere Ralph is a 200 thread count deep sheet
what is this deep sheet thing like a large like a towel like a long poop dipshit
that's not really nice thing to say yeah I mean like I expect better from you man I don't why
you know me do do do do do do satan what makes a good spider-man adaptation um
I guess we can try and keep that for him murder and rape and stealing no you can't do this
dab it I found out the uh brown table really likes homecoming and hates far from home by the way
oh and he thinks that uh far from home kind of ruins homecoming as in in terms of it being a
sequel like it's not the sequel homecoming deserved I was like oh I hadn't heard that take
I didn't know anybody had that I understand it I can see I can see how he got there
brown table is a fucking treasure you should come on efap do you reckon he would
I actually think I'm not sure he knows we'd be nice to him right I think so I don't know
what if he'd be up for covering people has he he's responded does he respond to a video before
is he just responded to comments uh is that supposed to be Jeb oh I get it you should
efap one of Ralph's but we just did right remember the meme mission accomplished wish
granted I was gonna say yeah that's right for a super chat to make a request that we granted
as the request was being made um wait what was the request sorry that we efap to a Ralph video
oh surely that happened after surely that super chat would have been sent after the videos you
don't know because we're still a fromage you know as well that happened during the video
you don't know maybe this person just joined the stream hadn't looked at what we were covering
and then sent that you okay
remember the meme of an anime of a guy saying is this a pigeon looking at a butterfly
I mean yeah that's probably perfect for is this supposed to be Alfred
it I hope Alfred reads this was this video supposed to be good every frame in Alfred
what I know who's been predicting Disney would make a live-action remake of Bambi me
Bambi's next yeah really are you shitting me down goes Bambi yeah that one's been confirmed
and by the way Rags I don't know if you knew this but uh guess who's writing it
oh the person who wrote Captain Marvel what the fuck yay they're getting work
you're gonna ruin the dude they are the right to the end a billion dollars
no that's the marketing team nope nope nope that's not how they look at it because they're stupid
they'll be like this writer's really good she's the old like I assume it's a girl because like
I think they wanted a female writer um ruin the characters of animals don't even talk
wow you have to justify it when you say she but never feel mean to just
yeah because there's more male screenwriters than there are women's
no I've proven this with science I looked into it
I just think that you're a sexism man
sexism man is a superhero so I feel like you just complimented me probably is
and the captain
captain Nazi world Nazis to your face is this Sith tag is supposed to be Alfred
for real though is this Alfred I figure I should have expected it it's like Dave Chappelle thing
all over again no it's bad it's just boring and it didn't make me interested or laugh go die
I've seen better videos defending TLJ yeah I guess we should have asked that question how
does it rank across the efap people we've covered right dramatic universe yeah
because it turns into like our malicious history is just being bitter and insulting the people
where would you like arbitrarily sort of scored as a number if you were to think of all of efaps
covered videos as a one one to ten scale or zero to ten with zero being very very good and
very very I guess I meant the reverse of that but it doesn't really matter as long as you tell me
we could do where zero is really bad and it's really good I guess some people do that um
two one wow because I was gonna say I give him like a four out of ten
really I think it's like a two I think five is generous come on Jay
five is fucking generous like do you think this is an average video not average video but like
um on average fat coverage video like the best one would be like what Sarah Z's
fly one they're the ones that we're promoting count or do they not no they don't can't no
probably is Sarah Z's video
else was good tunneled oh yeah unironically is one of the best videos we've covered
it's hard to know for sure but it wasn't very good this is exceptional
is pretty bad people are going to start using unironically is
unironically is becoming such a popular word that I feel like people are going to start using
it like literally to not mean the thing that it means oh you mean like because unironically
means that you're not fucking around but then they might use it when they're fucking around
just to make it sound like I am unironically dying right now yeah yeah I think you're right
I think you're right great we just found another word that's dying
ironically dying I'm unironically going to use unironically
unironically that's all I have to say
this is exceptional seems like all of Ralph wants is for a movie to scream at him incoherently
while flashing a strobe light that's exceptional yeah I think the theme is so deep its meaning is
so magical we've been making my soul we've been making Batman movies for 60 years I wouldn't
describe Joker as a Batman film while it is set in the Batman universe I'm not sure that it's a
Batman film as Ralph said in the video yeah it's a bit weird if the classification is it's a part
of the batman IP I'd be like oh so when do we get the hot doggler movie there is a DC character
named dog welder who welds dogs to people someone else wanted to tell us about that huh
wow it's strange that this extremely specific character is popping up twice
it's so good I hate how I hate how people give this mediocre singer more credit as an actor
than he deserves Jared Leto isn't good guys like at all I mean I think I was seeing some stuff I
thought he was pretty good in I can't name it because I can't remember but no he didn't he
wasn't bad in Fight Club he didn't have to do much he was he was there the problem with like I
feel like most people don't think that it's his acting that's failing in Suicide Squad it's this
weird fucking character that they yeah he's doing really weird stuff but you you don't not believe
it like he's portraying a fucking weird ass cringe lord gangster really well yeah
it's like the the things that are bad about it are the ideas
some good cunt left some dollary do's have some more be good motherfuckers
why thank you I'm surprised that all got through much for the dollar he's a cunt in a super chat
yep wow and motherfuckers both of them are just fine he's wow youtube you're not protecting me
you can fuck your mom but don't rape anyone I mean I would say that fucking your mom is yes
fucking your mom is better than raping someone yeah unless you rape your mom oh my yeah say
that's worse on balance than just raping someone if it's if it's someone related to you that makes
it worse because incest is like an additional bad is this supposed to be what you brought me
yes is this stream supposed to be alfred all my ewoks that's also yes does anyone seem
battlestar galactica thoughts I have not I have not I've seen like two episodes I felt like good
and I might watch the rest at some point you know more about it than we do how's that feel uh great
I'll enjoy it while it lasts I know more about death comes to time than you I'm gonna get you
to watch that one that doesn't even make sense death comes how does time die that's stupid
he needs to watch death comes we'll watch it and you'll find out no I disagree with the premise
therefore I can never consume the content chat anyone if like the three the one person
in chat knows you've seen it tell them how good it is all right fine read spy ex family good tism
very well give this to jay also kick him uh jay you okay with being kicked oh yeah I love being
kicked supposed to say please don't do it captain please don't do it is this part of the role play
oh fuck please don't kick me I would hate to be kicked
unironically I would unironically hate to be kicked uh hot doggla art sent your way
oh I assume that's the uh the thing that we put on screen that was good uh you did well
someone just says hoes mad right you're laughing rags has died and you're laughing
he came back I came back resurrected to the power of reason
hi rags are you related to rags the dog from world war one I don't know maybe
Ralph is in no fucking position to say you're being toxic have you seen his bye bye man review
he was so toxic to people who liked the video like the movie you mean or
yeah it wouldn't surprise me a lot of things like really uh altruistic principles that are drawn
in some of these videos are just like oh just look at their old stuff they uh they don't believe
it or at least they didn't then and it's not usually like bye bye man was two years ago right
I think but who knows perhaps he's evolved as a critic we all need to did you know that
Ralph did brain brand sins at one point brand sins wait he did that that was a channel cinema
since started it there was to make kind of brands it was really weird
hang on I'm gonna see if he uh
nothing's coming up uh yeah I can't I'm not getting results that
bye but so I don't know that well what he looks like so
oh
chat what videos did he do
so that was my first super chat so I messed up I meant to say I'm currently watching episode 46
at one point two five speeds so much long man to get through have fun seeing you 100 hours or so
we'll see you then moop man bad fucking booper a booper not sure if my previous
super chat went through was wondering if you guys had any thoughts on captain christian
making fun of my face hi rags who's captain christian
hi you're supposed to know these things I'm captain christian
it could be all along could be the only it was earth all along
I'm afraid I don't know these things also I just said hi rags and rags has not responded what happens
ola rag I guess I'll write down and make sure to say it once he's back rags speaking of not being
back I'm gonna hop out here oh all right what no it's just like it seemed out of nowhere but okay
would you like to flunk your channel yeah I have a channel bye oh yeah it's good you should go
watch it don't watch it it's really bad what have you got coming out soon uh 1917 review uh lego
star wars video wait you're reviewing lego solos I'm reviewing lego star wars but why
oh it seems like a fun thing to do not kind of like super old nobody reviews things they're
old that's racist I don't care okay bye bye
okay I'm posting his tismy channel in chat and now I am officially alone though ranks is in here in
spirit okay I'm here hello what you miss j running away and a high rags oh hello to the
person who said hello rags hello to you uh muba confirmed anti-mauler confirmed 2020 arc
I would say so okay drunk rags I hate long pauses he thinks about whether or not it's
worth to say the n-word for the joke cubans oh I didn't even think about saying that of course
not that would be no I really didn't I really didn't that would be disgusting uh the fact that
no one none of you remember what bane posting is infuriating bane was a huge meme back when
the dark night rises came out just google it I mean okay I believe you oh yeah I'll believe you
too I don't really disbelieve such thing hey fappers doggos uh would it be possible to get
all of your opinions on the witcher show and would you be able to get wolf's opinion on it down the
road thank you massives so here's some good news and bad news the bad news is me and rags haven't
watched it yet so we got no opinions the good news is wolf has watched it and he talks about
it for a decent chunk in the recording that's going to be coming out soon I'm not actually
sure about when that'll be I'll talk more about that at the end of the stream I suppose like
upcoming projects so when you guys gonna watch the Elvis the alien vid on you mauler
we did it's just not not much happens in it like it's not much of a thing to respond to
um yeah give this ten dollars to rags high rags hello just got back from the range my first
handgun you inspire me to buy a sig sour p320x compact well I hope you had a good time hope you
enjoyed it hope you get better with practice now if I can ask can you turn around and wag your tail
at me I'm doing it now it's just it's just like the audio version of that is not very exciting
yeah I figure I've watched ralph for about a year now and this joker review was the first
video because I had serious problems with you're in for something oh yes oh yeah hey it's me hello
there hi rags hope I'm not a bother on the discord long man passed this money on to rags no problemo
who said it uh cold vermak or or warmack oh thank you're a bother of the discord I think so
uh how about a movie on who killed the wanes in joker
I don't know what that means how about a movie and who killed do you mean like some kind of
detective movie going after the guy who did it the joker universal yeah detective uh constable
young vision of uh spectre gadget what's his name did it hey remember there was a there was
a spectral gadget movie and matthew broderick played the spectre gadget yep I remember that
I watched that and the claw guy I remember that that happened
and
hello all my end whoa dang it I miss wolf followed him since his original channels at 3k hope he's
doing well whatever he may be be well you fab um yeah he's doing well and uh you'll
got another interestingly enough the way it's worked out like three four four and a half plus
eight like another twelve and a half hours of wolf stuff to come out that hasn't actually
been made public yet so there you go uh if jar jar fuck rags would that be bestiality
yes no no nah nope
somehow video essayists have returned oh they didn't go anywhere
they just keep on trucking with a dickus that biggest he'll die of blood loss oh yes hello rags
hello what happened did you finally realize dv is pregnant with a half walrus lolly because of you
it wasn't because of me because of his own promiscuity there were consequences to your
actions and he's discovering that I'm will you learn I don't know anything one me well I'm saying
when will you learn to that creature when did our friendly neighborhood heroes in infinite crisis
bring the people they saved to the place where time and space doesn't exist or why why didn't
I don't fucking know guys uh there's nothing makes sense in that show as you'll find out in episodes
four and five uh not that you haven't figured that out already it's a weird one great fan love
this podcast reminds me of dnd for some reason thanks reminds you of dan and dave the writers
of game of thrones or dungeons and dragon pretty sure it's pronounced dragoons hey marv do you
like dragons uh I would say yes and hyma to that and how about no don't don't worry about it
I like dragons too they're cool seem like you had something there but no no I did they'll say it
for later put that in my back pocket all right why do they call Black Panther their movie I
thought they already had their movies the planet of the ape series wow that's that's uh that's
it isn't right there youtube won't let me speak the truth well you had to mute apes
you got an asterisk on apes wow I don't believe they block apes a dot block
cunt that makes no sense but then again youtube's pretty tizzly um what are you guys's thoughts on
the lighthouse I liked it I liked it too my movie is extremely allegorical I enjoyed watching the
events despite having very little to understand how they come together and then thinking about
it for a while after what was neat the acting is insanely good yes uh I think they take full
advantage of being in black and white and in four by three with loads of really really cool shots
and colors I say colors I guess I should say shading I don't know that uh takes advantage
of a look that isn't previously often seen um I think it's tense I was gripped I liked it
it says I gotta say the more I think about it the more I hate it I get all the references
to Greek mythology frankly I don't know how anyone could possibly miss them with how ham
fisted they were but it ultimately feels like one of the shitty high school essays I had to
peer review where the author would just string together platitudes till he hit the weird count
requirement I haven't seen a more vapid pretentious exploration of male sexuality since
only god forgives which is a real shame because I actually really like the witch
I guess I really like the witch too I guess I would agree that it's not subtle
yeah some of it's really some of it's really not subtle
but I think it's one of those things that if the acting wasn't so good if the like dialogue and
stuff wasn't so insanely amazing then it would really have suffered a whole bunch I wouldn't
have liked it if the like if Defoe and Pattinson weren't as good as they were I would have walked
away with a negative impression perhaps uh you should cover something you consider good the way
you do batwoman weeb tip check out Vinland saga if you haven't already big nut uh so we actually
recorded watching Mandalorian episode one as a test for potential youfap mini it doesn't work
because we're mostly watching it you know instead of reacting yeah Mandalorian episode one was good
like you we record watching it and then we're just like yay so there's nothing to worry like
it's hard to turn that into entertainment because at least with batwoman we can listen to what they
say and then point out how dumb the characters are being or make jokes because of how silly it is
but it doesn't really work with good stuff um trying to think of like I guess the best we could
possibly do would just be the putting up the videos of talking about the episode once it's
over because that that could work but I don't know it's just not really I don't know if there's an
inverted version I don't think it works that way um messed up on the first one you should try a
supergiant game sometime we'd love to hear your thoughts on them uh what stuff does supergiant make
supergiant let's find out they have fire bastion transistor and hades
I've heard good things about bastion and transistor yes I've not played hate I've not even heard of
hades I haven't done it but is hades oh it's an early access trailer doesn't oh no it does have
stuff in it whoa it's a game with colors moving characters neat uh might check it out who knows
and it says uh how do I get on your discords uh there's a link to mine in the description
how do they how do you I'll email me or something there you go yeah do that yeah
do that yeah give me money to uh count of monty cristo rags has good taste
yes I do rags write this down for sober rags you need to watch the anime adaptation of the
count of monty cristo gun kut suo it's a really creative take on the original story I bet you
would dig it I might I might I might uh have you guys seen the cop star wars fan made video it's
hella old but it's gold and it's not copyrighted or anything so it should be good to stream or
watch just look up star wars cops parody that sounds interesting and simultaneously strange
with the prestige I love the film right up to the end all the tricks are realistic but the end was
essentially magic or am I really wrong no no it's um well in their universe it's actually
they're saying that tesla could do it tesla could make that that's something with science with the
mechanical um obviously we don't have anything like that in our world but for the purposes of
their world that was something he actually created and um if you remember he talks a lot about how
uh he invented stuff that made him celebrate as a visionary but he had to stop because people
can't take too much change at once and he's referring probably to a lot of different things
but one of them being uh cloning that is not something that people are going to deal with
well there's a lot of things that have to happen if cloning became like regularly possible imagine
all the fucking things that would happen like politically for one do clones get voter rights
I don't know there's just lots of implications with it as well as what the film implies but
it being something that's not possible in our world doesn't bother me
um obviously cutter refers to it as magic in that makes no sense to him whatsoever
but it's implied that tesla is guidance
guidance uh hello chat oh that's everything in joker is real until the phone calls the
guest on the show the last third of the film is in his head while he's jacking it on the bed
that makes sense that's an odd thing to fantasize about while you're jerking
but all right all right i'm exploding uh 3050 mauler remind me to never put another joke or
reference in a super chat i put who the fuck is mauler reference to the not so great debate when
wolf mentioned how he first heard of you and you read who the fuck is smarter um that would be my
mistake for combining the s and assuming that's what was meant but yes i i have tism reading
sometimes feels bad man um uh good evening all you beautiful massives it's been a while since
i've managed to catch a live efap and i'm glad to see all of you again hi wags kick j and all my
best to y'all and our dear wolf thank you how dare you not like willow mauler i don't know i just
didn't really enjoy that much oh my thing 1917 was amazing odd question but did you guys have
any family who fought in world war one i do not know i have to check yeah i would have to check
i know i have family before world war two but i don't know about one uh just finished soma thanks
for the recommendation mauler also enjoyed your soma versus amnesia series was surprised to see
your face reveal any more recent horror game recommendations titanfall 2 and orre were also fab
oh yeah both of those are i'm highly recommended from fab law essentially uh anymore horror game
recommendations let me see um it's been a while since i've played games probably anyway there
are some there are some spooky aspects of hell blade um maybe uh resident evil seven spooky
at the beginning kind of yeah uh open up my steam go to my library
hit button dead space dead space too you haven't played those you should
uh dark wood oh yeah i like that and let's see what else we got uh
i don't play a lot of spooky games we'll play a lot of the evil within two isn't really spooky
at all but it's a decent decent game i liked it maybe you could play
hmm just looking through my games well scroll scroll and check them out
yeah i got nothing um yeah i mean i've just not got many recommendations to give at this point
for that uh keep on the lookout i suppose you guys see the post about a reylo getting horny
at disneyland and sexually harassing a kylo ren actor and they say we're the problem with star
walls that sounds weird sounds very strange very weird uh how many drinks you want rags two three
uh enough enough enough don't want one says high metal
he'd say hi 31 slash 15 don't act shocked at the 24 hour shift guy longest shift i had was a 90
hour the longest no sleep shift being 36 to 40 hours 86 hours without sleep is my record and
we've all done it without illicit drugs 86 hours without sleep fucking hell oh boy that's crazy
i couldn't do that yeah i can do that for your 100th episode you should have tonaled and the
dawn not joking i mean we'll i'll see if i could try and get tonaled i don't know yeah who knows
what we could get i feel like you probably wouldn't but i'd try bahamut is a fish so i will
so i you will only see its fin in your entire life time
very very good uh have my money because we love you why thank you the joker had a supposed amount
of alfred in it yes efap and rum and coke perfect saturday night there are a few yummy rags lord
mauler j metal how are you fine folks doing this evening doing good doing well my morning now it
used to be my evening i remember those days still your evening isn't it right yes uh i'm sorry it is
11 11 god it happened around a while
i think parasite is objectively the best movie of the year but i'd love to see 1917 or joker win
best picture also high rags metal and mauler kicked j hello hello and yeah i would be happy
with any of those three winning best picture yeah left foot media needs to guest on efap could be
a fun to debate sakario too with him since he was a fan also high rags dick j thirteenth doctor is
awful i've heard uh but yeah i mean you know it's fine to like sakaro too but i fucking hate that
movie i don't even want to watch it again like honestly but i'd have to if i was going to debate
about it um i think the next efap or the next one should be rlm's joker video i rewatched the video
and i kept frequently pausing it's really that bad do it um we actually watched that again in
the last like month or so there was it was like the opening five minutes is frustrating as hell
with a lot of like the criticisms they throw out and then the rest of it's mostly fine
except random comments from jay where he's like film's not real film
on the mic desperately trying to claw him back to reality it's uh but i don't know if it would work
for efap it's just not much to work with a lot of it would just be watching them and they also run
copyright so it's like watching a movie uh in terms of copyrightisms
which is kind of annoying but hey um on a scale of one critical how drunk is rags
oh one to critical uh rags you scored at like a five right now i i can't do math
so i feel like i i'm just i'm not in a position to say eleven teen
seven teen eight two four october i'm way too sober for what i just listened to
don't even know uh probably cover shinobi i will fall out kingdom fallen kingdom part video please
we're not going anywhere near shinobi he's a crazy person
go to the woods he exploded so uh rags thanks for plugging tayrock i've bought four and love them
oh man i'm glad you really like them yeah dude i wear my
it's uh it's they're good stuff i really like them i don't get in touch with them again
how can we get a meme to you when you missed it
it's this this the only way is to try again i'm sorry about that it's just that we've got by the
way wait until the next efap that's when i'm gonna do a whole boatload of memes we got we got like
a good 200 images to go through we're gonna do that we're gonna do was it a nazi or movie bob
quote because between me and rags i think we can be able to figure out most of them
and we're gonna do the i hit everything conversation it's the efap does taxes
episode where it's just like text based stuff slash audio i guess but not a video um i don't
even know who we're gonna get to guest on that because who would want to guest on those three
things i don't even know i would oh the other thing i was gonna do was um look at the plot summary
for colin traver rose um episode nine so that's four things we're gonna do this like taxes taxes
efap but yes uh until that's done uh don't assume that your meme hasn't been caught because i've
grabbed a whole bunch they are coming favorite characters and episodes of the simpsons um lisa
on ice was one of my favorite episodes i remember that uh loads of the the halloween episodes
because of horror obviously favorite character homa was really up there seriously fun as hell
to watch him do anything uh then i really liked mr burns i thought he was hilarious
got a whole bunch of the the the spring fielders are pretty pretty strong in terms of just
entertainment value um yeah i'm gonna go with the most generic answer ever i'm gonna go with homa
what about you raggers haven't watched simpsons there's your answer
uh i've got a weird question but would really appreciate some advice i have a sex toy coming
in my mail soon but i'm a little nervous about it showing up because i still live with my parents
what should i tell them if they ask me about it on its arrival uh as far as i'm aware they arrive in
an anonymous discreet brown box yeah i think you should be all right but on the condition that
they discover it i suppose um might have to be honest if they discover it and open it like the
problem isn't that you're sticking stuff up your asshole your problem is that your parents are
opening up your mail yeah that's not a good yeah don't yeah don't be on the defensive about that
be like dude what the fuck why how come you're opening up a mail and every time they try and
redirect back to the facts you got some butt stuff just be like nope nope you took it too far
look in my mail yeah but either that or go to amazon and order two different things that are
really cheap and then have them and then ship them to you or something so that you could say
oh yeah that such and such that i ordered and if it is that it is and if not then just take it
if they ask oh another one you're like yeah i ordered two i don't know i can't think straight
decoys send decoys say it's for efabs or the chat so it'll make sense when the weatherman
pronounced flan fair my ears heard flan by the push wing gas gongella quindrobo
flan sicilio gorgogorg i mean that's probably fanatically how it goes i don't even know
went to a graduation party listening to this efap came back home with a gf had a bath and
efap still going cheers will fall asleep to your voices very well why are we talking about sands
cuphead is in smash is that true i think so pretty cool is he i don't know if that's the case and
that is kind of nifty that's kind of cool oh it's uh cup has a me gonna a me gonna costume okay
something like
oh well i'm getting links to videos that are actually i don't know yeah
cool if if cuphead's in the game this world sucks everybody just shits all the time
and it's true man it's one of those worlds hi rags you require headpats you drunk doggo
oh thank you very much i could use some of those
uh response to shinobi 03 fallen kingdom part two oh don't be crazy my hero academia does genetic
superheroes better than x-men changed my mind it could do i don't know do you mean better than
the comic or the films or the ev show you got a lot of selection there i love how raggle fraggles
was too drunkified to answer my question what fantasy race would each member of the efap party
b who j is a gobbo wait i didn't even remember that question um oh my god uh i would be
would fantasy race i don't know there'd be some doggy thing maybe uh mauler would be uh
i don't know i feel like mauler would be like some kind of fantasy race well you're narrowing
it down a bit too far there i'm thinking no i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking um
um you come across as a
good question i wish fucking i should concentrate more um i mean like uh like in like one of those
old elrandy kind of elves i mean i'm good to gun for the history you get to have loads of powers
and you get to be really tall because chris philly is tall so that's that's how i argue
and what are the doggo like creatures of the of the world in terms of races
oh fucking i'd just be a degenerate furry a zab rack there you go let's hope that's what
you were gunning for mauler is a zab let me check no i mean you well someone said rags
zebra oh that's like the others are the horn head oh they're the dothmore people
oh rags be that yeah why would i be that that's
carnivorous carnivorous zab black um
you you you i literally flew to vegas from illinois and you massives are still going
poop with the door open never a bit more money for lessons for playing the hate pianos stay
classy mauler and have a great week you too would mauler be a bull or a cow also high rags hello
hello hello dang it mutually you're uh dang it mutually you were supposed to say oh my god
the way ragels normally does not dry lee read in rag speak
what what is in rag speak read in rag speak like how i talk that's racist so i give a give a
rags a pretty word oh oh okay i guess it's a nice thing anyone's ever said to me
yeah expect to see this in mupil's next performance review
oh i'm not going to tell him about that so the manager's never gonna know
thoughts on stargate sg1 and atlantis also high rags hello i never really watched them never
never watched it either perhaps one day if you're interested in trying to react to something good
again i recommend the expanse imo it's what people are missing on a ton of showrunners ignoring you
guys care about i didn't enjoy the expanse and i had quite a few issues with it but um i have to
rewatch it to be more definitive about them and again if the show was good recording it would
kind of just be meh because we'd be watching it i know that sounds retarded but like the the way
it works with batwoman is we react to it but we wouldn't want to be reacting to a good show
because we want to catch everything in the good show um but batwoman is so like terrible
the missing parts of it in order to react to parts of it is never a bad exchange and uh so it's like
a fundamental sort of thing that doesn't quite work with good shows i just i just it would just
mean the format would change not necessarily be worthless mauler into vampire campaign sponsored
by wod world of dorks i don't know what that is world of dorks that's uh could be good sounds like
a flash game world of darkness except dorks super chat is sponsored by world of darkness
no world of dorks uh gf request heat 1995 an unbridled rage when wait she hates it
most people love that film yeah but uh no i i don't i don't really intend to make a video on
heat but uh hey get the gf to do it yeah get that get that passion rolling um best picture
to 1917 best director to parasite best actor to walkine best supporting actor to joe peshy
best actress all supporting actress to scar joe don't at me i don't mind that selection that's
right not bad uh thanks for the hours of entertainment at work don't tell my boss
why do you not care for red letter media mike seems pretty relaxed love you regardless
i don't know what media i was there what show have you watched it we had to have it to defend
them all the time i really like red letter media i think that jay has a lot of tism takes sometimes
yeah uh but he's made up for by the presence of rich yes like whenever it's rich and mike
discussing something it could literally be just the consistency of soil and i'd be like let's do it
i could do it let's talk about dart dirt dirty boys me high rags brown table that's sexual
harassment narrator oh no the sinister brown table has come to spread his horrible logic
across town again but fear not citizens the efap crew is here to save the day oh good i want to be
we're here we're a superhero film yes we're a superhero so rags have you ever played as
space hitler in stellaris no i haven't played stellaris
soundtrack's great yeah i haven't played feels bad mourn shout out to the massives on daddy's
not house oh that's quite oh yeah man uh also high rags also also tfa part seven when
tfa part seven i'm like i don't think i don't think there was a part seven
this is just being used to me i guess uh i'll have to sort it out eventually
okay these are the stream lab ones coming up next got uh you were my favorite ewok anakin
i loved you very emotional nice of you to have fellow long men and person of shadow psa sitch
on for another stream no that was literature devil uh i can't believe it what a massive surprise i
am bored at work alone and behold my favorite ewoks alive time stamping 39 minutes into efap 70 so
you know where you are in the backlog well these get sorted into a different one but yes i may
have already asked this and my memory is tisming but mauler did you say you think of all of west
world is bad or just season two oh i think you asked this before and i guess maybe the answer
hasn't come through yet but um i think i haven't seen season two i've heard awful things from the
fan base though and then season one i adore episode one and then it just slowly turns to poopy
and by the last episode i really hate season one um i guess brief issues like the entire
the man in black's entire fucking journey is you know old vision is pointless like
and he's told that from the beginning and he goes on this really long adventure only for it to end
in him being like oh so that was pointless it's so beyond unsatisfying um which of the hosts are
actually conscious is extremely confusing uh ford's plan seems to be built on a lot of lucky elements
that bother the shit out of me and um the security in west world is selectively non-existent when
they want certain things to happen and it really bothers me but uh first episode's fantastic
bop it twist it pull it do it oh i remember those i remember them as well
bob it pull it you know i think they were being suggestive when they said stuff like
do it i wanted to fuck that bob it i knew it i knew it fuck it um suck it
uh opinions on pathologic one and two h bomb made a great video uh i tried
i tried to play pathologic one and i gave up after two hours and then i watched his video
and he actually says that that was like a common experience and then i watched all of it and him
explaining uh what's good about pathologic and it was yeah it was an awesome video but i agree with
his conclusion that that game is so fucking far beyond accessible like the good parts of it are
extremely hard for people to actually be able to access through its uh blendastropisms that's where
i can describe it uh the velocipasta so bad it's good i've actually got that noted down um because
someone else brought up in a uh super chat before um we may check it out for uh for an efap movie at
some point oh yeah thoughts on narcos that's the uh tv show i have not watched it i'm assuming rags
has not watched it either no no wait what which one so called narcos no i haven't uh there is a
wikipedia page called controversies about the word niggardly yeah that makes sense uh it's a very
friendly and innocent word though it gets it gets a bad rap if it turned out that all of the sequels
were the delusion of a poor desert girl high on drugs would that fix them also high regs hello
maybe better maybe they will make all this shit go away uh do you think prequels or sequels can
do more damage to a franchise not only in relation to star wars but in general also high regs hello
uh sequels i think sequels yeah because it can take active characters and fuck them immediately
while prequels uh i suppose to a degree the worst possible prequel and the worst possible sequel
they probably draw in terms of how much damage they could potentially do i i imagine i think
they have equal power to fuck the universe um i guess i think sequels have more power to
fuck characters that would be my conclusion without thinking about it a bit more 32 15
what is your favorite star wars disney retcon mine is the old guy who survived end all being
captain rex vader's former clone commander who ignored order 66 he was on a special assignment
at the time i didn't even know about that um i didn't either fun i guess favorite disney
retcon i don't like anything that they wreck it bothers me fuck disney fuck him with a bop it
oh yeah and then twist it twist it bop it uh yeah i don't know like i guess you'd just be least
annoying one i don't even know what to say about that
least annoying retcon
no i i hate them all i'm just thinking about all the different things they wreck on i just
hate them all i'm sorry they're all just as good because they're all terrible
uh good night massive ewoks good night good night does tros have a ray finder
i wish that ray got lost for the whole movie no then we'd follow her being lost that it would
be a nightmare at least she's not ruining things true true then everyone else gets killed and the
first order win and that's the star wars universe the first order ruling the emperor palpatine we did
it we did it that's better actually yeah uh what's on patricia taxon's rags video i hated it i don't
think you've seen it worthless i was a little bit slow like six fuck it throw a little bit of it
shit yeah and it wasn't very good uh
i've watched all of your star wars unbridled rage videos in preparation for the tros unbridled rage
can't wait till it comes out also rye hags and hit leah hi star wars girl and every other massive
very well put together see j long bone euro n word passes aren't working i was fired
oh no sorry um happy almost new year thanks for keeping me entertained at work are you all ready
for flappers tommy guns and prohibition to make a comeback flappers yeah i remember flappers do
you ever learn about them no they're like promiscuous women would agree oh or clothing that was
more free-flowing stuff yeah sure let's do it let me some flappers
down with the mouse yeah i think that's fair yeah down vistimos
ruined johnson makes jj abrams look like spielberg um
yeah like they're both competing to make each other look better than the other or something
i don't know it's an odd contest where's going on there there we go
thoughts on down to nabi i'm three seasons in and it's surprisingly good
i've not seen any of it i haven't seen any of it but there must be something there if it's
going on for a while yeah weirdly like i've heard a couple of good things when i really didn't expect
to so hmm there's a good reason uh rags i think i might respond to patricia taxon's video for
you if that's all right uh yeah go ahead give it a give your best shot man it's there's gonna be a
lot of stuff that i imagine won't be very difficult to uh disprove a robot um jk i own all the best
properties i could be a nazi would be and you choose not to be what what in the world would
be wrong with you they have such nice clothing you know just become a nazi and then un-become
a nazi just to get you know yeah just to take insignias off the uniforms uh bob you freaking frick
happy new decade oh wait make sense yeah happy new decade yeah what was this given
well this this is uh the overflow oh i didn't even know we were in the overflow
you know we we caught up to our stream ones just relatively recently oh boy because i'm like i am
tired how tired all of the times really i'm really tired more what i'm really tired
how long have you been going it's almost it's 11 20 right now we started at like 1 30
yes we haven't even reached our normal cap yet god damn nazis
uh what do you think about vati video he kind of reminds me of you uh who he's a dark souls
lore video guy i like a lot of his stuff um he went through some controversies with how he
gets his info i believe but um i think you pretty good tism don't know much about him
whoopies i never heard him i don't know anything about dark souls lore because you're not a nerd
idiot nope teenage moron oh er have you seen violet evergarden

cosmonaut variety our stall was coverage yeah that's actually you know it's on the cards one day
uh we'll get to it uh central time is best time happy new year's my fellow massives
happy new year happy new years happy new years everybody since time gang gang gang
do you shout out small channels rebranded myself i mean depends on what you mean by shout out like
if someone puts it into a super chat i don't mind reading it out but uh we don't tend to showcase
unless we particularly uh like a thing um or it's relevant to the thing we're talking about
that sort of thing uh if having sex with kathleen kennedy would thanos snap the sequel trilogy
would you do it or not
huh if having sex with kathleen kennedy would thanos snap the sequel trilogy would you do it
or not uh i'd probably take one from the team yeah sure she was she was like a kind of woman
who needs a good dick in any way oh and you can always you know just think of king and country
yeah like you could like i don't know you could think of a hotter chick and try to get
done as fast as you can you could think of the hot doggler yeah you got a hot doggler
like i'm the hot doggler and i'm here to save star wars with my penis that's just yeah that's
this whole thing that's like the movie's about uh my favorite movie this decade is either the
wind rises or boy and the beast i do not know what either of those are
i haven't heard of them just hope ewoks doesn't become mainstream and lead to banning return of
the jedi as a hate crime movie also hi er blessed stuckman jlb anna waggled and moleboy hello waggle
hello hi there here's another five for putting the happy in my happy new year smaller no problem
happy new year here's to another year of tisms and shit hi risgar

molar could you please deliver aragon's full rise men of the west speech in the welsh accent you
note it as being the normal welsh accent it'd be epic um long speech well um maybe molar i'm
seriously super tired i about to just like be done you know i feel like i'm you know
hey it would seem i missed a bunch of my messages being read on a previous efap would you be able
to tell me the last time streamlabs ones were read i listened to the catch-up one didn't hear
him i thought i'd seen all the efap eps after i sent them oh i have no idea which of the specific
one it would be but uh because i definitely answered the um the west world one maybe like
i would have guessed catch-up one or two but i i don't know for sure i am sorry about that
um it's just that there's so many like we're talking lots and lots and lots of messages from
lots of peoples also rags if you want to um you can go to sleep i can but what if
but what if there are hello rags i can save them why how come you're still going i'm not tired
you're not tired what the fuck i don't know i'm not tired what time is it for you right now
it's only 5 30 a.m oh my god we usually go until 8 p.m ish so i mean sorry 8 a.m ish so i still
got like three and a half hours until the usual end you got a lot of that right well remember we
start an hour late because everyone totally turned up on time uh god damn it played us like a damn
fiddle that's kind of racist but right um
because maulers get smashed on one beer that's why wasn't absolute lies lie
uh marry fuck kill the sequel trilogy hmm
kill tlj immediately just feel that way about it mary the forest awakens
yeah you could try and change it eye walker
just fuck it yeah that's what we're going uh for rags taking one for the team dicking kk what a
legend oh yeah boy that's what he can turn things around like facing the other way
i can't do it with great power comes great responsibility
that star wars guild do you think we will ever find out what happened to ezra and thrawn asking
not because i like rebels but because i like thrawn also high rags hello i will keep that
question and yeah i know i keep a lot of questions and i haven't necessarily filtered them out
correctly i do need to go through those i've just got lots of things to juggle but they're all noted
and saved so they will be gotten to one century or two for example all the wolf stuff actually is
done now and it should be released relatively soon because i managed to uh not have it to be that
it's blocked with copyright it's just uh it with the old monetization limitations which is fine as
a slime uh nah southpaw when he gave tlj an a minus i hated him oh that's probably about
chris duckman also calling to your witcher and have a happy new year have a new year happy new
year hope it's pretty good gathleen kennedy is always making the face of someone who just
smelled a really hot fart also high wags hello well she has to deal with the sequel trilogy
all the time yeah it's you know it's one of those you made your bed now lie in it sort of moments
i say yeah holy hell y'all still going this truly was a wonderful birthday oh i'm glad you had fun
yeah what are your thoughts on the death note anime if hollywood gave it a big budget film
treatment who should direct it who should star as light and l if he manages to answer that uh
i'll make a note if he doesn't i will save the question
do if he's still here or not i would imagine star wars star whores a triple x parody is more
coherent than star wars the rise of skywalker big props to your show good work peeps i agree and
thank you um actually that kangaroo was trying to gut the dog with its toe claws big memery high
uh tism high spicy saucepants i'm writing this to fill up the super chair oh high spicy sauce
saucepants yeah although thank you y'all said death note is awesome it should never be touched
by hollywood again okay there you go rags enough with the i'm tired tisms entertain me you dancing
oh um i think have you ever have you ever looked at
you've danced with the devil in the pale moon dance from the devil in the pale moon light have
you ever looked at a clock and been like oh my god clockwise to the clock's perspective is
counterclockwise oh my god that makes sense 100 uh in a movie called secretary a girl is
fascinating about her boss banging here and says please mr gray put your frick in my mouth
i swear uh who says that put your frick in my mouth a person's barbie frick is their own
you don't go putting that in other people's mouths that's just wrong put your frickin frickin my mouth
no uh jf and df were too focused on emulating old westerns and samurai films that they overlooked
the wonders mando ship could work in a number of situations
yeah kind of yeah a lot of writing issues a lot of problems a lot of episodes that just
uh hello everyone except rags yeah how about you don't fuck yourself
that with a bop it and then twist it and then pull it cap was right anyone disagrees equals
filthy statistics rags you beautiful doggo let's 69 each other and celebrate 2020 i have a thick
porta rican gift waiting for you oh my god that sounds like a great old time let's fucking do it
uh hey it's my birthday i had an exam today and i got an a how did your day go
my reviewers pretty good uh i think our coverage was thorough i did of uh of mr mr ralph and um
managed to get through a whole bunch of of fundisms and questions yeah ralph did not get an
a on his examine no he did not no he failed he's a very bad a question why have a good woman when
you have your own hand but why use your own hand when you could have a good woman
uh
because vagina feels better in your hand i guess it's a weird question but i mean like
actual sex is way better than jerking it

new rl rsl so many ads good hups and then night rags um i'll even write that so that rags can
eight rags yeah i don't know i'm i'm really not tired uh it's the way it doesn't work
hey er you want to come on
you can keep me on the screen if you if you if you happen to be interested
uh i'm going to put a cap of face message
there you go let's find out very very interesting opinions on rise of skywalker if you'd rather
not open that can of whims than happy new year lads been a bit since i've caught a stream life
that was after we did the full stream on it and i've got a video out on it so um check those out
if you uh you wanna
aha and last slightly longer in this call hello
how dare you mute
intensive
might be able to procure a fringy as well
uh
yeah it's all good
heck rlm specifically mike labowski the thinking that the st is bad on the pt is massive
cuck revenge the sith video is 98 subjective
yeah they still think that uh the sequels are stronger i remember when that was a super
controversial thing to say and nowadays i think it's controversial to say the reverse
interesting how that happens uh i was having the biggest grin on my face through the whole movie
some cancer kid was coughing through the whole movie ruining my fun cancer kid just because you
cough does not mean you have cancer also i think that because i had a gap there
i think we might be through the new year's messages or at least
yeah i want to say it's possible no no um no guarantees not sure exactly where we are now
we'll probably find out through context eventually and i don't know how many hours i'll be able to
go on this but we will sold your on for the moment you keep checking the new ones to make
sure i'm not missing anything it's important to get the orders right uh on the subject of
static characters like tywin do you think that a character can have an arc that is wholly contained
within their backstory as in we gain information over time that shows they changed over time into
who they are in the present story yeah i think that'd be pretty interesting like you have
characters who knew them when they were younger but uh they're the only ones that can speak to
them in a certain way or they they could obviously talk about it as uh stories go on
and you could learn a bit about them in that way i think that works um watched tlj before tros
and resolved two plot holes you cite tlj still sucks though one finn and rose deduce how to
disable the tracker just says that i don't in a row just deduce how to disable the track
i can't remember what that counters specifically and uh c3po says there may be an unmapped natural
exit um that's just that's not there's a there's a big open hole but a pile of rubble has fallen
into it like the idea that that's a natural exit would imply that the place wasn't built to be
walled up with specific exits and that i don't know there was just some kind of cave in that
they were like hopefully it just has something that fell apart at some point like that wouldn't
really make much sense for a base would it but uh the i still i would still stand by the idea
that they're they're cheating with stakes to a degree they're like this is uh absolutely no way
out of here and then they're like oh well i mean there's a way out once uh once the plan to assault
the um uh the cannon fails you know uh here's two hours of entertainment my thank you massives
inspired me to write my own review of coie currently at 15k words episode one two and ten
minutes of episode three covered expected to be three to four hours long in total high ranks
kick j long man good quite a high ranks you want to make sure you catch all them you know
and uh yeah good luck dude have the food
una momento
hey oh hey do i sound all right i went for being alone to having two how's that there we go
threesome no that's the big gay yeah oh oh no gentlemen hello rags died so uh i decided to carry
on without him it sounded like he died a long time ago in a galaxy far far away yeah pretty
much he uh he was really hitting the sauce yeah he's a strange one with alcohol it seems to be
like he's uh though like i said that's so much cheaper if you know what i mean like you don't
have to spend as much to get fizzled in fact you just have to buy a six pack and you can get
drugs six times across the week not bad not too shabby super jets if yes yes uh all we're up to
date i'm just doing overflow of which there's um there's a chunk to say the least there's a chunk
if jedi and sith were real which side do you think hitler would have been on oh the jedi
yeah with the sith he'd be like hey emperor can i have the no okay well
i'm kind of stealing up all the power with the jedi he could probably slip in there you know
devious plans or that they're all about bloodlines
i've been watching the witcher it's decent so far that's not what i've found
i have heard it was decent but i haven't watched it yet so i can't judge
i don't believe apparently it's really uh like when the show came out uh the games
like they kicked up in player base for a while that's nice um
logic just added me saying he would totally come on if he was asked cough cough i'm pretty sure i
said i would invite for the new year's eve one i am outraged but uh yeah i actually wouldn't
mind getting another logic episode just gotta find the right video for him to cover instead of just
think star wars it's got to be in his realm he's not a star wars game
if view account drops rlm has posted their review i think that did actually happen during our
so what happened earlier did like a copyright strike knock the stream out
no it's just just it's the thing that happens now apparently which is just it just stops
and then you have to stop it and restart it i don't know why it happened this is like the
fourth time now and it's my internet's still working but well you know what that means eight
hours left what's the thing like it means i get to stop whatever i want as opposed to
i have to stop at a certain time so hey that's uh that's good
so if anakin is technically palpatine's kid raise his grandkid and ben is anakin's grandson does
that make ralo incest hashtag sweet home tatooine yes i want a corgi but i work 10 hours five to
four to five days oh i i assume corgis may be high maintenance i don't
because some doggos you can uh didn't leave that take care of themselves in like the house where
you go to work right or is that um things for many dogs i think some of them here a corgi
rob walker doug's brother jabs at tlj haters are the worst never addresses any criticism just
criticism criticism just characterizes them as crazy fanboys um i'm sure some of them are crazy
but yeah it seems to be that a lot of a lot of people like to be like hey you guys are the nuts
ones and then you're like you show them patrick golden's tweet and you'd be like nuts like this guy
maybe not any chance you guys are going to play the push the button jack in the box jack box game
again that episode had me in physical pain from laughter i das seek heil er hello and uh i don't
think we're against it it was just that was like um randomly we had collected up a huge
amount of people they were just like hey we can play that game let's do it yeah and the thing
of it is we tried that we tried again at one point we didn't stream it but we had about five people
and the timer only gets to like 15 minutes that's not enough time oh it really isn't we tried
but oh the aliens just kicked everyone's ass give this to er and call him my rigger
are they referencing something with that goodness it's scooby-doo saying the n-word oh
oh my yeah um have logic to cover rr the republican guy's like yeah i suppose baby
dude that debate was amazing oh that was funny as hell yeah uh please rate the joker films from
best to wist batman dark knight suicide squad joker so when they say batman i'm guessing that's
the 89 so suicide squads worst surely um yeah wait so are we rating the films in general or
the jokers from all of these films pretty sure joker okay so the worst joker is still suicide
squads sure i agree then i mean i probably do prefer heath ledgers joker to uh yeah jack
nickelson's when it comes to walking phoenix versus heath ledgers one that's gonna be a tough
one the way i figure this in my head is like what would you rather a sequel that involves
walking phoenix's or heath ledgers and i'm like probably heath ledgers yeah maybe i'm like biased
by the fact that i know that it's an impossibility so i'm like i want it even more they worked they
both worked so fucking hard on their role so it's like it's so it's just so hard to choose one
of the over the other but i think i would also have to say heath ledger unfortunately it's a
tiny margin yeah i was gonna say i think ledger wins out outside of suicides quite i like all of
them yeah yeah uh thoughts on cosmonaut i'm sure he's a nice person but his logic is insanely
retarded yeah um i liked his hellblade review uh it was pretty good he can be okay but sometimes
it hurts i've seen like i want to say like 12 videos from his channel in total now i'm like
oh every time his arguments suck and uh he gets so much shit wrong and this is the thing like i
don't think he like needs to he's his format is relatively sound like he's got good quality
production values but the writing my god the writing
i haven't watched him but he said i was right on twitter once you got to appreciate that
well if you said you're right surely he would admit that i'm right about something right
so like hit little kidding it's gotta be exactly you're the furor see kyle common runt
see kyle any thoughts on the naniya film also buy wags we'll put that in the notes
collecting up all the wags the what film uh naniya film oh yeah i remember that being pretty good
back in the day i think people liked it right i don't know chronicles and arnia didn't really
i don't really remember it but yeah i don't really remember um aslan was pretty cool
yeah um i'm gonna chat talk about what you thought of the naniya film to let this person know
because i i'm really not sure of uh what the public opinion was on that i think people liked it
i yeah i think so yeah uh i don't remember much of it that's all it's just the the film is uh
uh i remember aslan being liam nason i remember the witch big cold because she was frosty i remember
those things that means i remember the whole movie yep there you go very much
i love how shad says retards so freely but he refuses to say ass makes me so proud yeah
that's the thing about notice i didn't notice that yeah retard is like super common in australia
so it's oh it's yeah kind of like kind of like cunt yeah that one would be the equivalent of
probably saying fuck for them like they're like that one's super common but then america would
be like that's if this is the word you use when you run out of every other word like no
um oh we got a lot of shite belch awful movies were mare they weren't so good yeah don't remember
to be honest yeah uh shad's comment on sibling rivalry was spot on oh he has a comment on it
sibling rivalry is the um the thing that nostalgia critic does oh yeah critic
oh right i should probably put sibling rival
must see spoiler corner or non-spoiler i don't really
say your trings say your tring all right i guess it's not
i'll find
this icon is pretty distinct unless he said something in the stream and that's what we're
referring to i didn't know he actually watched nostalgia critic if he does
are we talking about uh shad oh yeah sha diversity
i wonder if uh who the voice for that is uh i wonder if he keeps him pitched down i don't know
it sounds like it kind of he hides somebody i don't know no cannot find it so i don't know maybe
that was from the stream yep uh what will be the next debate efap any chance of getting jeb
nickels on the stream no there's no way in hell she would agree to that i'm sure she thinks we're
like the worst thing ever like i seriously doubt she would ever come on yeah she said it over and
over again and as for what the next debate would be we haven't got any plans but uh you never know
in the future although we would be happy to have her more than happy to hammer and we will be as
civil as we can be i need sleepy tisms as well good night long man and friends don bless good night
if finn and poe would have kissed at the end this would have been a 10 out of 10
and you know i think people would have way preferred that and they could have cut it for
the chinese vision still yeah there you go solves both your problems but disney um maula started
streaming eight hours ago okay cool it should be halfway done i still catch him sorry i can't stay
to watch long i'll catch it all moolah love you guys high rags i will save the higher
got we got one two three four five rags related small messages oh oh you know what hang on a
minute hello there we go yeah that was actually fucking creepy for a second
love the content you guys haven't seen much efap since it kind of blew up but glad to see that
it's still as great as it was when it started happy holidays and hi maula hello and yeah uh
partially thanks to jenny nicholson for letting people know about the show
promoting it this is very kind of you thanks jenny you're cool you're okay yeah you're you're
all right efap is the best entertainment on youtube there is so much video essay crap i
see these days that i would have believed to be good had it not been for you or had it not been
you um yeah it's par why we wanted to do it because we would casually watch them ourselves
and be like this is bullshit this is stupid it's like we want to we should stream this because
it's funny because yeah the first person we covered in episode one was totaled we were like
that would thrust as a well-respected youtube video essayist why
maybe it's because he's handsome yes very handsome ea next video when
never oh still uh still thinking of doing a tros one or is that how's that going yeah yeah
eventually i'm in no rush though never am hey my argentinian grandfather is a hero since he is
the one who killed hitler he was able to sneak into the bunker undetected because he looks just
like him now he runs a local gas station with a low low low price of 1488 per barrel
let's see uh every time you guys say mcmuffin i can't help laughing oh so this is probably
the actual main star wars stream then i think i don't know i mean that's where we are in the uh
the overflow i can only guess i always rise of skywalker doing at the box office seem casual movie
goers like it and that's horrifying it got over a billion that was the thing i didn't want it to do
but it did sad it's a billionaire film uh any chance of getting jeremy johns on the stream
i've i think i tried to contact him at one point but um no luck so far wonder what we talk about
oh i can't imagine what could possibly be discussed it probably wouldn't be star wars that would be
yeah i discussed everything else we'll talk about lord of the rings
it'd be great here you go um beware the jealousy of the bullqueer love y'all that's uh that's an
rr video right there in the joke of this movie about wane killer on the run in joke of this
movie about wane killer on the run it would be maybe maybe well earlier i said maybe it could
be about gordon could make something work per chance uh the fucking dead speak total
well shad was the film the spaghetti bolognese you were looking for i will save that or shatter your
wanted to tell ray he's force sensitive from jj yeah apparently apparently there was a bit
more cut that he was going to do related to force stuff but i like how most people came
away thinking like oh he was trying to tell her he loved it wow that's what i thought at first
there's some reason but you mentioned the force thing yeah jj didn't think that that's kind of
how people would find that unless he just didn't have enough control over it but i just feel like
yeah most people will interpret it that way maybe because of his bent that way
okay maybe someone cut it that wasn't jj that was like let's make it look like he loves it
people will like that yeah that's what i'm thinking it was some what would you call that
you know we got ray low so what we got like fin low oh no wait fin low oops i mean uh i thought
he was serious like fin and kylo put together i was like i get it fin fuck ray low rr ray n
fuck it i don't know i tried red low is just him kissing his foot or something
after he's dead yes retiring to relay for some sleep night massives good night
uh fly me to the moon let me kick its fucking ass let me show it what i've learned in my moon
jiu jitsu class i i can see how you could change the lyrics that way very good
um uh what lines in the movies say palp made anakin uh when he talks about manipulating
life through midichlorians or creating life through manipulating midichlorians and then
yeah that was that lines up with the whole like who's the father and then she's like there was
no father and it's like uh hmm it was the force it was implied and i think johns has been watching
efab in his recent top 10 videos etc he says in my biased unprofessional subjective opinion
i did a double take when i heard that i mean it would be pretty funny if you had seen any of this
but i'm gonna press the x button is this person claiming that jeremy johns is dog whistling
his name is jerome
ah jerome uh thoughts on uncut gems should have been nominated that is the next film that rags
and i shall be uh checking out actually it'll be fun on the bun god are we getting uh getting
even bigger house now going back to a full full roster almost yeah hi there how you doing i'm
going green man i don't know if you know if i was dreaming right now all right hi so it's
it's the tail end of an efap all right rags went sleepy tisms and i'm reading out remaining
super chance so it went so long that even rags couldn't make it through rags was drunk rags
got rags out of he had a beer and you know how he is after a beer he had a beer that he was gone
every time someone brought up you would deny however much you actually drag you'd just say
lies every time someone said it was one or two oh yeah happy australia day and all that
yay australia did it the horribly disfigured by boons but they're alive they're like anakin but
a country how did they get the sweet helmet who be obi wanted that scenario your prime minister i guess
uh okay well i mean if australia is going to be anakin getting on some life god damn birds
i don't know i feel like i feel like it would be more apt if it was america you know no wait no
hold on yeah no uh that wouldn't work if america was anakin and the british empire was obi won
on their arms and legs there would be the uh independence day gone wrong
tell er his death note videos are fantastic
i wholeheartedly agree um are you going to be covering the next time they do death note
on netflix which apparently they're going to do probably i don't know what they're going to do
that oh yeah they're doing a sequel outside yep and they canceled uh they canceled uh
daredevil and then announced that right around the same time netflix just chock full of good
decisions yes it's awesome uh uh mola who would your ultimate efap guest star be i vote for the
dawn ultimate guest probably like dude honestly it's gotta it's gotta be tumbled i was gonna say
probably like ryan johnson could you imagine that and like he's contractually oh yes he's
contractually obligated to stay here for two hours and i can just ask him questions could you imagine
that yeah yeah that would be that would i would want i would want like a whole week of prep and
i would write the shit out of so many i'd be writing questions with a specific intention of
him not being able to weasel out of them oh my god but no i mean i would like to see the dawn
or tonald there's lots of uh good stars but i feel like that could be very fun
um also george lucas that could be cool i think because we could like sit down and watch stuff
with him yes i don't think ryan would be i don't think we could really sit down and watch you watch
a gedel episode one or two with him just see what he thinks does this speak to you what do you think
it was inspired by you he's like why are we watching my videos
uh please oh wait yeah please rank disney star wars films from worst to least worst
with tfa rogue one tlj solo tros
so um least worst out of all of them is obviously going to be either rogue ward or solo these days
i still edge towards rogue one being the least worst but i can understand towards work run being
the least worse i would say i'm going with solo it's fair enough so it's those two and then we're
stuck with the trio of horribleness yeah and if we were to say worse go ahead um i well the thing is
i find it hard because i'm inclined to say that it's basically they've gotten worse and worse
but at the same time a lot of why the sql trilogy is bad is all because of the setup that tfa is
yeah this is the thing there i'm picturing them surrounding a table and in their hand
they hold cards and these cards like tros's card says destroyed anakin's legacy destroyed the force
and uh kind of fucked with just how i guess the lightning still counts as the force so
yeah those are the two main major fuck ups tlj's are destroyed space battles destroyed luke
and destroyed force ghosts kind of got destroyed as well
and then tfa is world building i think destroyed is not even a fair word to use it's a bit more
serious than that yeah and killed harn as well exactly and so yeah it was based on that that
i decided i had changed my mind and i said tlj is the worst over riser skywalker they've all got
a really strong hand that's the thing i don't i like how they they couldn't just be one that was
like not even it couldn't just be like bad you know it has to think it had to be just destroy
the destroy everything like it's like they you know they're rolling a dice it's like so what
are we going to destroy this time around throw it down luke all right easy done you know yep
just like oh i just pictures like tfa says i destroyed harn then tlj's like i destroyed luke
and then tiara is like i destroyed anakin like okay i destroyed the original trilogy
well they all did that they've all kind of had that they did
um back bar immediately it's like i destroyed world buildings like i destroyed the force and
i destroyed space battles you're like kids kids you're both just you're both the wits
we hate you equally they're all so bad uh i suppose i'm gonna go just with personal
preference i guess with this uh i still think that there was i think tlj put it into its
permanent grave where tfa stabbed it repeatedly and that we could have taken it to the hospital
to a degree not saying it could ever be rescued it's like um you know after tfa it's like okay
you know right this is just say you know there's blood everywhere but yeah he's just riddled with
bullets it's like all right all right we could fix this and then he just gets run over by a
semi-trail it's like oh no that's those foundations are gone yeah um and then tros is like tlj but
again and i don't know i just feel like the damage isn't as impactful uh after tlj but it's still
majorly impactful there's no denying it oh hardcore so for now then this is this could
honestly change by the next time i talk about this subject i would just probably do
where's tlj then tros then tfa then uh rogue one then solo no so then solo then rogue one sorry
mine from worst to best would be uh the rise of skywalker tlj tfa rogue uh solo then rogue one
i have not seen solo or rogue one so i can't really put those in any categories like the
thing is is um a lot of people say rogue ones like the only one that's okay and i'm not even
really in that camp i think i don't really enjoy rogue one i only like the last 20 or 30 minutes
of that movie hmm okay that battle of scarif was pretty cool uh battle er do you want to throw out
your yeah uh solo i'm gonna put as the best and uh all those all the sequel tlj it's kind of tied
for me um they're all so horrible i really fucking hate tfa to be honest yeah i totally
understand so maybe that maybe that's the worst i don't know yeah i agree um all right uh death
note and stein's gate are the best also mola give me some of your thoughts on bird man love that
shit i saw it when it came out in like wasn't that 2014 so it's been a while yeah i think so
yeah i've seen it so i enjoyed it i thought the performances were really good uh i've got a bit
uh headache-y with the one one taking in that and i think it's because the camera moves a lot
um from what i remember i'd have to re-watch it again but it's a really cool idea for a movie
and uh interesting story for sure um yeah death note is yeah it's pretty fantastic fucking best
actually er i have a question um all right now uh do you think do you think the death note like
in terms of the quality of the story takes a significant turn for the worst when uh
are we can we talk spoilers for like a 15 year old anime at this point um yeah all right i know
and so you don't really oh yeah i think you i think you know where i'm going with that
does take a really big dive unfortunately i mean i still really like it but um yeah it's definitely
i think but it's like good death note no i think i think the first 10 you know like the first
arc is probably like peak death note it's it's the peak cat and mouse game yep would agree
yeah q and a question one no one question for ryan johnson what would it be why why
see that that's the most hilarious answer i think but i would i would actually have to really work
hard on a sort of a question that he can't escape easily because why he could just be like because i
so you'd be like oh fuck off you don't so yeah um i i what uh maybe my question would be so just
walk me through like the whole movie tell me like from your perspective what you did
it sounds very confrontational but what i mean is like just just walk me through it like what do
you think your movie is about oh yeah i would see i would love to do like an audio commentary
with him as well and then just keep jabbing just pause it yeah like he's just like i always
saw hux as a funny character i'd be like why i don't know he's just amusing it's like oh he
like kills millions of people but yeah get a funny guy uh what are some maybe lesser known
mystery thriller films or tv any of you would recommend ideally but not necessarily about
paranoia surveillance cover-ups and shady groups feels like i've seen everything before
24 probably doesn't and also 24 was popular so that probably doesn't count
yeah it's probably not a satisfying answer does homeland count they've probably seen that
yeah but homeland that's what i mean it's like are we talking movies tv shows or anything oh
yeah they said films and tv all right okay um hmm i i don't have yeah i don't have one
yeah i really don't know yeah i don't watch a lot of it no i love to like i honestly like
google will probably help you out with that one like just search genres and tv shows and stuff
um google got a bigger brain than we does you yeah
yeah the sequel trilogy can be summed up as follows they took old yellow from
yellow from little timmy and gave him to ramsey bolton yeah yeah
gonna add that right how was uh how was how was the joker video by the way that's what
you're watching today right it was pretty bad yeah i still haven't seen it you haven't seen
the movie ralph or whatever his video i haven't i haven't seen his video i kind of held off on it
um but now that it's already been covered on efap i kind of have no reason to hold off on it i'll
just watch it it's a fucking dumpster wow i remember i watched the first part and i was really
yeah i wasn't pleased with what i was seeing yeah we i think we had like we got six hours out of it
oh boy look a while uh if disney announced they fucked up this trilogy is not canon and they're
making new sequels to the og films how would you guys feel about that uh it's too late like i mean
carrie fisher you've lost her so you can never do what i think people were wanting to be done
i'd still be like this is good but yes preferable it but unfortunately they've kind of blown it
like there was one opportunity and it's gone forever i mean and i'd be like you guys uh
you don't need to make them again just stop just yeah just stop i'm happy to just decanonize and
have nothing new i think i might go as far as saying you can make some new stuff but do not
touch a single character we know right how to be totally divorced even like a thousand years in
the future or the past because like at that point we're just gambling with everything that comes out
which is like hopefully this is good nope okay next one no okay then one time we get something good
hey that was good well i think that's the inherent risk with our direct sequels is you kind of just
run the risk of messing it up completely you know like you you run the risk of causing real damage
to what came before so just don't do it yeah yeah yeah probably a good way to avoid it just don't
um please rank the avengers ensemble movies from best to worst uh oh that's that's easy
the selection is that they've given anyway is uh avengers age of ultron civil war infinity war
and yeah because they put in ensemble movies as well but it's fine out of those five so
i mean would you do you want to go first for me and i'll just see if mine is exactly the
same as yours because it probably is so mine's civil war sorry from best to worst civil war
avengers infinity war end game age of ultron um wait is the list how much we enjoy them or how
oh if how good or bad they are it's probably going to be end game at the bottom unfortunately
yeah i was i was actually going to say as much as age of ultron's retarded i actually think
end game has written or uh unfortunately which is crazy when age of ultron has changed your stance
did we say that it was better than age of ultron in our first stream
i don't know well you did say it was pretty good that's what i remember well we said we really
liked it we also rated it much lower on the objective scale for him because the time travels
fucking ass but time travel is retarded it ruins everything bad it does cause a lot of problems
but the age of ultron but like everything with ultron is just garbage like it's nothing makes sense
also yeah i would i would actually say that i've definitely soured on end game and i think that
i said that in the stream like it's just going to be a matter of time for the emotions to die down
for uh everything else to remain which is all the mechanics it's like those pesky mechanics
i guess the thing is is um if you were somebody who if you hadn't watched maybe if you just
watched the avengers movies let's say because if they just watch end game they're going to be
totally lost but if you watched all the avengers movies and then you got to end game like the
character stuff would still be pretty potent but maybe not as potent and so you'd be left with a
lot more of the wow the time travel was pretty dumb yeah um so uh i guess best written to worst
written i would place civil war at the top as well uh then it's yeah i guess your avengers is tighter
than infinity war because of the stupid gauntlet godlike kind of fucks with everything yeah then
no i think i probably like infinity maybe not i'm i feel like i do but i'm pretty sure that i
really i don't know the issue is i know that when i watched avengers for the first time i thought it
was awesome so um yeah yeah and then and then uh ultra on that end game but in terms of favorites
it's mostly the same list yeah it's pretty much the same for me as well uh except i'd put end game
yeah and like if we were to rank in terms of i guess um if we were to measure the gap between
each of those movies civil war to avengers is modestly big like it's not that big but it's
it's imperatively i guess yeah avengers and infinity war are really close for me
and then end game is moderately behind and then ultron is just totally like way ultra can be
frustrating to watch i don't like any of the scenes with uh ultron himself because i just
think of the potential i well it's just like why didn't you make like seven really good versions
of yourself why did you make your like they're not mean he literally destroys one of himself
for no reason one of the good ones it's like oh you you damaged me it's like yeah but you're still
pretty intact and the idea that he sent every single copy of himself to uh fuck where is it
is this a kovir yeah why didn't he like put at least a couple just send them all over the place
come on why are you so stupid how like visions just like oh you shot me out of the internet it's
like what like what how is that even an ability that you have the second you make him uh the his
intelligence is tantamount to like the internet he should be unstoppable basically it's over yeah
it's over we're super retarded and then they're just like vision looked at him funny and now he
can't access the internet i was like what is this where is that a rule from like that stupid scene
with the revolt where the camera's spinning around it's like it's there were several times
where ultron like just straight up flies right above the button and it's just like dude just
press it like why are you flying above it just press it also it's ultron's device why would he
make it a possibility to do it remotely remote triggered yeah we should stop talking about that
do you love the scenes with uh with hulk and black widow they're really great
oh they pissed off so many people
have you massive seen the morbius trailer yes i haven't it uh looks fine
the morbius trailer sony's spy marvel universe
um there is an m a mural of the samurai spider-man on the wall in the background
and vulture from homecoming isn't it is sony prepping a little spider verse action return of
toby no idea we'll have to see what happens we haven't even confirmed that he's vulture yet
but uh i'd assume he is it seems likely and plus we already know that sony wants to do like a venom
team up or something or a venom movie with spider-man in it jay logburn's getting made right now
jay logburn said vision looked at him and he can't access the internet what
it would be easier to take material of the st and rewrite it into something good
than the pt pt needs to be redone from the ground up massives i disagree flip that around
entirely yeah opposite way around the prequels need some work but the sequels the premise is
yeah i don't understand how we work like if someone said okay you can rewrite the sequels
but you have to keep that harm divorced layer and their son went nuts because of an old man
called snoke tried to kill him and the the first order of i was like now fuck all of that
screw that there's no empire as well i know there's no republic it gets wiped out in like a day
so all right uh for clarity mauler meme repository tweeted updated leaks on december
10th those leaks were 95 to 99 accurate fair enough also high wags let's rub our little
doggo butts together oh my god i'll keep that he's not here oh no i'm keeping all of the high
wags i'll have the accurate amount to say to him when he ever gets back next episode i'm just gonna
kind of list and make him say hello to each one uh-huh uh as caesar augustus i need your help son
episode three lol i don't know what to make of that i'm afraid i may have lost the context
i was behind in the stream but wanted to add this in the extended universe specifically the
old republic droids are memory wiped often to help prevent them from developing errant
personalities uh also droids you meet in the cotol games have wild personality traits and even some
ptsd it's essentially advanced ai but kept in control with memory wipes hmm i'm maybe they
shouldn't have like that explanation but maybe in star wars it's probably not a good idea to
explain it at all because there'll be something that contradicts that yeah i don't know how i
feel about it because i think that it's always played hard and loose with it i think fast and
loose it's a bit of a we start to question the characters not dealing with this sort of thing
uh like and i don't want to go there like star wars isn't going there you know like we're
too busy with other stuff i think that's an interesting thing to explore in something that
isn't you know a big mainstream property but yeah you probably don't want to ask those questions
about that sentence i wish jumanji 2 released next to tros good film i've heard that it's
entertaining i need to check that one out as well because i like the first one enough i haven't seen
the first or the second so there we go on the add it to the list when huck said i'm the spy i
laughed so hard and started imagining huck's as the tf2 spy saying i am the spy oh god what a joke
yes definitely a joke uh the falcon survived episode nine to become ray's ship was it with it
nope ray has all of the uh the items of interest of star wars she owns all of it she even took pose
droids it's like wow oh god oh yeah wow she sucks she has she has all of it and then she throws
them away it's like oh my god um can you please watch patrick explains blade 2 do i have to watch
patrick one of those videos i feel like it's bad for you you should only minimal exposure but um
dude you can't you can't watch movie bob videos how could you not put up with patrick williams
fine because he is probably better than movie bob actually i'd give him that
movie bob's tweets by the way i'm not sure if this has been talked about oh my god he does not like
his his tweets it's like he thinks if i make the sentence long it's a really smart good sentence
but sometimes you should put full stop yeah his the way he writes he confuses the fuck out of
everybody on twitter with his sentences it's like what the hell are you saying oh you know
that's because you're stupid and it's like no man please just put a full stop sentences aren't meant
to last forever uh i can't believe the oscars nominated the most mediocre star wars score from
episode nine and not nominating the irishman school with its memorable creepy tone star wars
gets nominated sort of it's kind of like obligatory i'd say like yeah you know you have to and plus
like john williams is a very talented composer even though obviously i think the the latest stuff
has just been not as great uh oh good i caught you guys live now i can tell you that the best
media of scooby-doo is the mystery incorporated tv show iteration uh fair enough also and look how
convenient this is also dash bullshit any hype for half-life alex uh yeah i'm gonna get it i have a
hd5 and i'm ready to go i am really interested in that one i think that might be the one to
to kick off vr i think so i think that's what they're going for well it makes sense because
it's like the first sequence of this long i feel like that's why they made it this does it like
they were like what could we do it's like let's do it with half-life that'll get people to buy it's
like oh man that's mean well i think um i i mean there might be a cynical way to view it but i
think it's also a way of like all right so if we did like half-life three out the bat everybody's
going to have sky high expectations so what can we do that's going to be interesting and cool
that people won't expect and maybe it'll change how they expect you know what their expectations
are and if you make it a like a the game that they're making i think that that's definitely
going to help them out yeah they could not do half-life three the way they do that they
they decided to do the side on so yeah and i'm hoping i'm hoping that that will indicate that
valve one of make some more video games you know that might be nice unlikely it is unlikely i know
i think i think i think everybody's given up on yeah they're certainly about hardware now
well i guess um there was a article that came out recently that said that they weren't making
life for dead three there were some rumors and they just totally squashed that like they squashed
that yeah um and i guess portal three is probably not even a possibility i mean what
could you possibly do with portal at this point i think all you could do is make portal two again
and i think the way they ended it seemed to indicate that they weren't going to do it again
they were like yeah they might want to own just the fact that they're not like to kick on with
the story is going to be very complicated so they could just own being like oh it's just here's
some old they can make a new ip yeah that's exactly what i was about to say and i think that
i think that they should i it seems like a lot of our developers i've i hear that
uh naughty dog's going to be making a new ip for ps5 um and that that's curious Santa Monica's
going to be making a new ip for ps5 um and i think there was another one like oh i was playing xcom
two earlier i'm like oh wonder what faraxis is making and apparently they're making a new ip
which is cool um yeah um so in addition to that nasca nasca oscar's school thing they said oh
and mkt revenge of the sith back in 2005 what that means mkt ah okay um i don't know if revenge of
the sith won an oscar for its uh soundtrack back in 2005 or not oh it deserved it if it did it
definitely deserved it if it did win that uh movie bob acts like words don't exist so they don't work
on where to put it anyone here looking forward to half life alex hey that got answered hey yes well
just in case yes i am i sure am ray didn't put those lightsabers in a box just in the sand she
couldn't even wrap them up she put them in like a little thing but yes little rappy little bitch
i know bone works man halo reach has awesome spawns you guys i love spawning and getting
assassinated straight away are you playing reach right now oh you are playing reach right now i am
yeah that needs to add a new game in because i'm getting sick of getting spawned killed i'm sick
of high noon i'm sick of playing bone works is the vr seller for me don't need half life alex
i played bone works that's interesting i like that i haven't finished it because i was i was
playing it on an index elsewhere i don't own the index it's kind of expensive right now
but uh played that pretty interesting i like it that game was developed by one of the guys who
was you know like the freddie wong like early on wasn't it um no kidding i think so i think
it was interesting yeah because the gun play in the game is it's pretty detailed but it definitely
feels like portal so i think a lot of people would feel pretty good about bone works if they're
really trying to get a half life game going definitely has a port okay uh the composing
of episode nine was lame it's like williams said heck it and that scene when rey was fighting the
guards the music was harry potter happy ish i'm not sure that he got much time from what i understand
i don't think that he got much time is it this one was it his son that finished or his brother
or something i think it's i think his brother helped him but i'm pretty sure that yeah like
i'm pretty sure he just didn't get much time because um i i think this film like wrapped
production a lot later than um the other two did you know in terms of how close it was to release
probably because that film has looked very different over the course of the muds it was being made
oh yeah of course um like whatever the final cut was probably wasn't there for a long time whereas
i'm pretty sure that whole um sons of mortis or whatever it was with uh matt smith like there was
that whole other film that was going to happen and i don't know if they actually filmed it or not
but yeah um well they did do reshoots i think um i mean reshoots are common but but yeah they did
do reshoots disney reshoots means uh we're doing the film again it's like okay me too uh the ultimate
mary sue she has both the big bad and the good guy's name slash legacy she's the ultimate jedi
she has both a unique lightsaber and anakin's the millennium falcon chewy and all the droids
god they gave it fucking everything hey man she earned it okay
i mean she she did technically because she beat all the sith
what a pretty press line yeah she just kind of flicked him across the board just i like how he
didn't stop shooting lightning even though it was i i i would like it if he was like why did two
lightsabers make a difference what does that that doesn't make any sense i was like i he didn't
learn his lesson yeah he talks embossed and didn't sink in you know the definition of insanity you
know it's like i don't why did he keep doing it obviously it's either it's safe or retarded either
way i still like the theory where it's like if he's missing it he can't just he can't just stop
pissing halfway through uh yeah droids are basically aborted because that's the solution
to avoid committing a slavery kill them before they become sapient sentient beings repeatedly
but you're right that it isn't really great for a mainline story that's what i mean it's just
star wars isn't equipped to deal with that i think right now you'd have to have like a film about
that probably because that's going to be heavy stuff you don't want to acknowledge that like oh
it's if you've been trapped in a box that we could erase yeah like it's a great topic but it's not
a great topic for something that's very casual and loose with the that kind of thing uh please rank
the crisis on infinite earths by earth number in other words which earth is the most boned
whichever one died first out of infinity that one was the most burnt oh that show um
um a chat or back a chat or so back i said hello wags backwards uh just in case it was confusing
sorry if it was on the subject how is rags doing i guess i will keep that one he's drunk and sleeping
soundly i just like to add that i love how random it is that shad is a member of the toxic brood
yeah not sure how that happened really it just did though yeah it just really no telling who
we meet these days you heard star wars people together i didn't think for a second that i'd
be talking to er but here we are man john williams scores need the director to cooperate cooperate
with john unlike jayjay so they can pace the scene and music to each other even in tfa you
could notice the songs looped but did not crescendo or climax because the music had to be able to go
anywhere generally what you do find with a lot of property like a lot of projects is that the more
involved the composer is in the actual production i mean like mario donnell was in house at bungee
and it shows because a lot of the music is synced specifically with certain beats that's probably uh
wasn't there a behind the scenes video of um george lucas scoring the uh the jewel of the fates and
he's you know talking to george lucas while he's doing it yeah and figure out what's that video
there's that uh apparently john williams was going to take the choir out of jewel of the fates and uh
george told him to keep it in which is hilarious to think about wow considering what everybody says
about george lucas's sort of decisions with the prequels yeah there's the narrative that you know
what it's probably none of it to do with him it's like come on now i mean yeah i guess um the thing
is i i've heard a lot of people say that he was surrounded by yes men but i've heard and i've seen
stuff that would indicate that he was surrounded by people who were constantly challenging him
so i mean i wouldn't know right like i don't know what can i base it on exactly i don't know
yeah isn't it weird how russian bots have such great taste in movies
yeah right they know what's up you should just follow russia russian russian
bot accounts and find out what movies to watch i find it very interesting that russia
is like the new big bad again it's like we've come full circle yeah russia
f for palpatine died for us sins ot's son of the chosen one wins st daughter of satan wins
it makes sense she ended she zaps the sky ultimate power yeah
uh ray going full kirito kirito mode made me laugh oh he's referring to um
sword art online kirito the main character also a mary sue character in their own series
oh there's a question for shad i shall keep thanks for this stream i'll have to catch it
all on moolah um hi shad i liked your book would you let jj from orion johnson make its movie
i'll have to keep that for him as well
imagine we can get a funny answer for that one
do uh mary xmas fandom menace mary xmas i guess this was like either before or after christmas
i don't know this could still be new year's then i'm joking don't let them near your book oh
okay i guess i'll add that on
look up best lightsaber iraq is maren okay
oh that's uh good looking what are you seeing like a body armor set of lightsabers
what the fuck that's so goofy yeah it's stupid that's awesome it's like he crosses his arms and
he cuts several chunks of it for yeah i feel i feel like it's gotta be risky as fuck dude
he's got sabers coming out of his kneecaps so that's why he's on his knee
and he put this thing at his cell phone it's the stupidest shit i've ever seen
clearly shad needs to make a video on that oh my god just on that image alone he winds up with an
hour the viability needs to be assessed i don't know that that's dumber than the the stupid um
non-chuck lightsaber yeah probably but cooler looking uh question for all present if you had
unlimited time plus money who would you hire as director and writer for your own movie you get full
control and you can direct such writer if you choose still pick someone as an advisor in this
case for me it would be sam s mail from mr robot oh have you watched mr robot no that's that's
that's the question oh for a second oh i thought you hadn't watched the show yeah no uh i don't know
for me oh director write a combo someone i can work with i might just like immediately go with
edgar right that's a that's a good choice uh quinton tarantino would probably be my pick for
that like he wouldn't be very cooperative like it would be his way or the highway the idea was that
he could be well they said an advisor right if there could be an advisor because yeah i would
say that i probably wouldn't pick him up to write and direct might because he probably wouldn't
accept that he wouldn't do that i don't think but i'm not sure how many writer directors yeah
that's that's why i'm not thinking about it like that i don't think a lot of writer directors would
be keen on doing someone else's idea any other ideas maybe um maybe jackson yeah i think that's
a fair one um mike flanigan i would mind working with him for director um hmm stephen spillberg
probably a cool one i think
rystafa nolan but yeah i mean i probably wouldn't you know take much of his ideas about characters
what about um what about why uh joss weeden maybe maulo would you um yes i don't know what to expect
though i mean if i could pick a time frame i'll just go with when he was making buffy and
block him out of that okay because uh i don't know what he's up to these days he's making a tv
show right now i'll definitely watch it when it comes out uh is uh oh okay i think he's right
about acting she picked she had her Abrams no
yeah sorry i don't have an answer for this one because i don't really have a favorite director
that i've really considered not like watch movies but not enough to really study on directors and
choose which one i will follow if if we're an animated movie i'd want to get chuck jones
chuck jones yeah um oh do you know who he is or yeah of course i do yeah yeah yeah i was about
because i was like of course yeah no that's um that'd be a good one or maybe like
uh maybe brad bird as well for an animated movie yeah it could work if you could pluck him out
iron giant incredibles one hero or ratatouille as well yeah yeah brad bird's good
my god what are we supposed to do with that question what are the components of a good fight scene
believable choreography yeah i'd say that's a big one uh i'd say another important one is that
the characters there's like an actual motivations of the fight beyond let's kill each other generally
helps yeah believable choreography and the lack of camera cuts too many camera cuts
get some creative filming going don't go with the fast cuts and zoomed in yep um a fight that
isn't superfluous something that you couldn't cut out or have it be replaced by somebody saying
these two characters fought like a fight scene that you need to see consider having highs and lows
uh in terms of like pacing like things are really fast and then they slow down for a bit and they
go back up i guess look at the raid two and look at how they did the fight scenes and then just do
what they did and yes uh head met wall good good point make sure your weapons don't disappear
that's look that's a plus that's a plus also don't don't do a bunch of throwing knives and then
like an axe that gets thrown right at the end of the scene
entire mustafar duel was discussed with spielberg cool i don't know that if true
uh it's involved in everything rise of skywalker reylo fight on two different places same time how
i don't know i don't know well any of that works um please rank the following efap debates
by best argumentation skills just right major lee yazen so major lee was easily the worst out of the
three he was very bad at arguing and what i mean is argumentation skill not quality of like
it's like yazen wasn't too bad at generating arguments they were just insane as in like uh
denarius is crazy how do you prove this she uh walked into fire in season one and it was like
but she knew it wouldn't burn her you didn't know that for sure like you know that as you're walking
into the fire that it's not burning you and so you would continue and then he was just like nope
nope that's not that doesn't nope she was crazy to do it and that means she was crazy in the last
season too which is consistent like that would that he'd just stay on that while major lee would be
like hoe was wrong in the opening of tlj you'd be like no he's not he's like well leah slapped
him it's like that doesn't mean he's wrong he's like and then just just right did a lot of the um
well yeah i find that when somebody's laughing in debate it's like oh you're buying time you're
like trying to think of something yeah so i guess uh best argumentation skills you know what i'm
gonna give it to just right as top then yazen then major lee that's that's that's my experience
well
false fringy church scene in kingsman
um i mean that was that one's really good that was really good but wait what does it what does
that scene counter that you said though i said that you should look at the raid two as an example
i can't find big team i i was i was um i was saying that the raid two is a good example of
just generally the good things that you should be doing a fight scene uh maybe maybe divorced
from the story aspect since i don't think story's very important but there's a lot of
long cuts really good choreography highs and lows and different techniques and different
weapons and there's a lot of variety um the kingsman fights really good though so i love the
yeah it was great that's the backdrop to one of the fucking craziestly
animated memes that we ever had as well yeah you had to keep pausing that thing to see all of the
inside jokes and they all made so many references uh the world's had answer had some really good
fight scenes as well um like the the one in the bathroom or the one in the bar where like oh yeah
definitely yeah where simon pegs trying to hold on to his drink and he's fighting all these dudes
and as soon as he's about to take the last sip it gets knocked out of his hands like oh for fuck's
sake yeah i would have to go back and watch uh the protector with uh tony jaw i mean that that
movie was terrible in terms of writing but the fight scenes like they had to send actors to the
hospital over and over again for that one and you can kind of see it because they're really
kicking the hell out of them i don't know how well that stood the test of time but uh i i remember
that pretty fondly all right dead ever would be another good one for the whole way fight scenes
oh dude yeah daredevil the daredevil show dude fucking the most recent season of daredevil had
an 11 minute fight scene with one camera yeah no cuts either there were no cuts no there were no
cuts at all they put in like some spaces where they could cut if there was a mistake but they
didn't need them 11 straight minutes of a fight a dialogue and an escape one fucking camera yeah
that was incredible it's like um every season they had to because the whole way fight in season one
is really awesome and then in the second one they have the bigger library one down the staircase
with the chain yeah uh that one's really cool and then in season three they're like all right
so how do we top that all right 11 minute fight scene and then they were like how do we top that
in season four um okay so i i would love to have seen what they would have done for
oh my god just watch the one entire episode is one camera yeah that'd be cool like a fight where
um it's one cut like there's there's no cuts and it's maybe like daredevil and bullseye are fighting
each other and then there's like a lull in the action and then they fight again uh what could
have been maybe in 2021 maybe maybe um iraq is maren was basically forced joffrey and possibly
one of she's sheaves bastards he later sassed his lightsaber instructor and got lobotomized with
a saber to the head his mum tried to save him but he became a raging half mindless lightsaber
need brute okay is that the guy in the chat that's the guy with the the the suit of lightsabers i
guess all right that seems very hazardous to give us especially somebody's yeah yeah uh
another good one would be christopher mcquarrie mission possible fallout and to clarify
the question it could be two people one writer and one director or a combo and for fringy my pick
was mr robots sam esmail if he didn't catch it yeah yeah from the uh yeah sam esmail is a really
good choice especially wow no for both he's he's really good at both he's just very talented that's
the thing i would probably like to function as uh like the writer with uh interest in you know
discussing and looking at the direction and then the the director could do the same in reverse
they'd be like yeah i'm kind of the same i'd i prefer to i don't know enough about cinematography
or um at least like beyond the layman sort of understanding so i'd have to defer to somebody
who knows better uh mary quansmas guys love your stuff are there any stories in extended universe
that would make for actually interesting new trilogy i'm pretty sure people said throne
throne was the easy answer for that um i guess does kotor count as um extended universe at this
point awesome i think i'm not sure that it's canon because kotor would probably be a good one
yeah well it's not canon anymore disney made sure that i guess such nice people
uh
one for shad babu frick is dope and cute but nothing on baby yoda
baby yoda's available yeah baby yoda's pretty cute you all know this uh the five people in my
theater lolled when we saw a star wars character named babu it's a generic indian word for sir
but also used as a surname in some parts of the country also wake up j and kick him he's not even
here anymore how far back are these no these are all well these are all from like a month ago
upwards of now like we're still pushing up this is this is our overflow from several episodes
there's just so many all right how many how many more do you want to do i'm gonna do as
many as i can till i get really really sleepy obviously you guys can stay for as long as or
as little you want there's no price uh now lightsabers can come in all six colors of the
spectrum fun fact in return of the jedi luke's lightsaber was supposed to be blue but it didn't
contrast well during the siege on java's fleet i remember reading about that there are seven
colors on the color spectrum that guy said six who am i supposed to trust him or you uh okay so
red orange yellow blue green uh no it's all the colors of the rainbow so that's um violet yeah
seven it's definitely seven uh hold on i'm gonna google that it's rogy biv it's seven you're correct
uh color spectrum it's seven okay yeah so the color spectrum is yes seven colors yeah rogy biv
red orange yellow orange yellow green green to go violet you're wrong wow fucking that guy up
he's gonna come back in a super chat and years from now bring and fuck you up
all right he's gonna be like catch me out on one of the things i said that's wrong
but that's gonna be he's gonna be like six is seven if you think about it from was back
his standing point of view it's just a point of view i've in my opinion there are six colors
yeah and that's how opinions work uh ray is so annoying during this movie really can't stand
his stupidity this stream has been great happy holidays guys say hi to wolf forest
i'm sure i've seen efap fans talking about efap on other websites i've visited for years the
toxic brood is larger than we realize love you all and it just ends with rags full stop
okay i'll i'll keep that for him mary fapmus and uh fappy new year you massives
uh that's a good mess happy new year uh they use time travel in rebels to save asoka she
wasn't dead at the end of the series not even joking i've said time travel in star wars canonically
now because rebels is canon no one likes time travel go away time travel that's funny because
there's a lot of things that like as much as i enjoy the clone wars to summit well i said yeah
i like the clone wars but there's stuff in there that's canon that's like that's a little bit goofy
you're probably like that's a little bit oh anna's in chat she's saying that there are two more
colors because you got black and white but uh well black and white are shades so they're not
really like on the color spectrum color spectrum so like um so the color spectrum being you know
like infrared then you got like the visible color spectrum and then you have um i think uv x-ray and
gamma ray i think it's yeah so um whereas black and white yeah they're just shades yeah and
specifically i think she might be confused we're not talking about the actual lightsabers from law
we're talking about the color spectrum well i guess the guy said all the colors on the spectrum
he doesn't say like all the well it depends on what she's referring to um unless she's referring
to like like rgb and then you've got cmyk or um or uh what's the other one hsl i don't know this
yeah i'm not sure it might be that i'm not really that i'm just not that invested anyway i'm just
it's seven okay uh soco was confirmed alive after the battle of endor shad her species lives up to
80 years force sensitive up to 200 she'd be in her 70s by tros oh yeah because she's dead
because she's a force ghost shad said that she should be dead anyway so i will save that for him
oh no there's no reason i mean she was only like she wasn't she was a teenager and um the clone
was and then plus 20 years and then plus like 40 years now she could still be alive
that's why i'm i'll save it for him well in case that's what he said i can't remember if he was
saying that uh do do asoka survived her fight versus vader with the help of time travel i'm not
joking oh oh yeah yeah that's right and rebels i don't know man don't do time travel please um
that's always girls in chat please add it to the stream and ask you to rank the star trek tv series
she has a show you could do that with he's like wanted to come on here to answer your questions
or whatever like uh i'll i'd totally add her if i was like on my own right now it's just that
i got uh retisms already and if anything i would kick one of these guys out but i don't have the
heart to do it that'd be mean it would be mean um but i invited you all the same time so that's
what happens um desperation cloying at company you know how it is uh merry christmas you filthy
masses and chat ra don't throw santa off the roof here's to another year of molar eartisms and
toxicness thank you my friend just watched tlj rip after i recently introduced him to you guys
double ripped for time and he brought up a good point who was the mole the first order said they
had in the rebels in tlj they say they have a mole i don't remember that whatever happened to um
the the the guy that they met on cancer bite i guess he just just left never to return yeah
got stampeded
all right
i'm searching the script for the word mole and i'm not finding anything
do you just have to script tlj on your computer well you type star wars the last jedi script
into google and then i'm right yeah i know alt right youtubers discuss color charts
so of course that's what we do important uh oh yeah and uh anna said she's rated them
on stream before must get asked that a lot i imagine because there's just not a the the
star track is starved on efap because barely anyone's seen any of it like rags are seen tng
i think i have to basically any i know that um i know that next generation is the one that a lot
of people consider to be really the best i think i think all i know i know the names of the shows
because i know they're star trek next generation deep space nine voyager and then there's the new
one discovery that everybody seems to hate yeah everyone hates discovery and picard is looking
like it's pissing people off already as well oh yeah i heard some people liked picard uh i guess
i guess all i know is the anna noed rotic and a few other people are very unhappy with
their already doomcocked all right well yeah i'll just turn on that one then yeah twitter
thread about it last night who did sorry jay longbone oh she's been watching it yeah yeah
i'm so sorry assuming it's bad
uh the one to the one referred to as torn cloth i would like to extend an enthusiastic and sincere
greeting that may find you in the high spirits upon this conceived live meeting of intellectual
minded fellows okay okay i think that was a super chat for movie bob i'm not sure but thank you uh
i just wanted to say thanks for validating my thoughts on all the terrible media being
tossed at us recently there were wags we'll keep that uh i have nothing to say about this
soul crushing series so merry christmas and high ranks another one another one my premise was
ben having limited force potential frustrated about not living up to his family's legacy
ray an actual nobody padawan of luke whom luke favors over ben leading to ben's fall
so it could work maybe anything else could work better literally other than what we got
shad is riser skywalker the pineapple on pizza of star wars i will save that for him
the only way the sequels could be worse is if they built the plot around something that entirely
justifies the space nazis like in gundam unicorn uh fuck gundam unicorn i don't know
all they do in gundam unicorn but this guy didn't like it yeah fuck him i guess
rinka needs to shill his books that's true you could you could do that on efap books plural
how many is he written i think two decent number of books no he's written more than two i think he's
written like six or seven oh well i don't know how many he's written overall it's just on twitter i
thought he was he said that he's got the two of them now are on uh available uh i what i what i
understand is that he's got a few that are now on audible but there's oh okay yeah and i think i
stumbled on that bike so i just saw him on twitter said he had a booked in like wait you write books
hold on and then just looked into it so a question what is the plan for the mcu without thanos and
tony surely of they were gonna do a galactus arc we would know about it by now it seems like
they're just making movies just because they're gonna they'll drop a few hints in the next few
movies for sure i imagine that they're gonna because you probably don't want to make an
avengers movie for a while if you want to make that sweet sweet box office money yeah i wouldn't
be surprised if in the end credits of after marvel 2 guardians 3 and fucking dr strange 2
there's just bits and bobs of this a planet being consumed for you know if if they have it
or something maybe um i'm i'm almost certain they'll do galactus but who knows what they'll do maybe
doom well i mean i mean yeah dooms uh they got they got a lot to pull from and now that they got
x-men as well you can do i don't know you can do apocalypse i guess everything they've built and
all that yeah they really ran that line into the ground didn't they who uh yeah i don't know
what they're gonna end up with out of that selection maybe they'll just fucking go with
mafesto over that i have to introduce demons and hell and shit i don't know that could be fun
we shall see uh please rank the skywalkers by force power in movie canon
put it why anakin luke leah and shmee yeah she's she's not actually skywalkers sorry i've been
what yeah you're gonna fuck right off with that uh i guess shmee's on the bottom then luke uh
leah sorry then luke then anakin then bed i guess because bed seems to be pretty fucking op
sometimes i don't know it's kind of hard to rate his force power actually
well he can stop lasers which is something we've never seen other force users do i mean
yeah definitely didn't see that in the ot or the prequels it's just that
it's a it's a relatively reasonable extension of what we understand it's just that that's pretty
pretty pro seems to be um but yeah shmee's at the bottom then leah
then probably luke and then i don't know between anakin and ben i i want to put anakin at the top
obviously kylo's a kylo's tisme so yeah but so that so ray is definitely at the top of like oh
yeah ray annihilates all of them she breaks the scale she's so much further up than all of them
she's not fucking skywalker yes she is i know she's not yeah is though let her be true
i would love to know how many people in in theaters around the world groaned or said
oh fuck you
who was the most inconsistent character i missed it due to a parade that it was ray
kylo is the most inconsistent but ray yeah yeah it would have been kylo but it's disqualified
yeah it was ray and it was all because of her family i thought she was just
very sadist but nope it was guaranteed to be uh kylo like there's just no question
also play creation said vader stopped lasers in his hand in esp not quite the same he like lets
it hit him and it blocks it sort of thing like kylo keeps it in mid air for a while
the kind of precision that would take i don't know the way i understand the force it was just
it was obviously just for the flashy like change it was like a fucking cool that is
but i imagine it does actually take more concentration to stop a bolt and to like keep it
there yeah it's weird because it implies that like the the momentum of it is still in action
he's just frozen it almost in time because it flings into the so does he like broken the rules
like physics and momentum either that or he decided you know what when i release it i'm
gonna throw it over there
according to angry jew it's a good film very entertaining if you turn your brain
nice one rags you'll never be able to live that down
have two meme videos for you check twitter hope you enjoy it massives hi rags and hello future me
we may have reacted or not to them that's such an old one that i have no idea but um
as i said we we watched like 40 copyright videos that were memes with with wolf and um
i thought fuck it i'll try and upload it i got hit with like 30 claims it was hilarious but for
some reason none of them said it can't be viewed all of them said they get the money and so none
of them get it as far as i know with how it works it's just like they're all yeah i think that's
how it works if there's like a big old deadlock of several claims just nobody gets anything
and so yeah that should be able to come out now theoretically we'll have to see what happens
um and the um and wolf reading the superchats meant for him are all good to go as well and
like i said i'm not sure i'm going to try and get those out as well as getting the infinitisms out
as well as getting obviously this part one part two efap out lots of things on the way for the
owl moolah channel um no bullshit debates are gay jared oh my god he's a queer uh thaiwan
lanister is a homosexual the gay triad is complete uh i like how stupid no bullshit is he's one of
the dumbest people in the world like honestly i don't i can't like i'm sure of that accolade you
are to provide him he's so fucking stupid he's just so he like i don't think i've ever seen
someone who's so bad at arguing yeah uh please rank the palpitines by force power ray creamy
she ray number one yeah that's pretty easy and by a considerable margin suit i like how we have
like a zero to 100 scale she's on 100 palpitines are like one well you tried uh
legally blonde unbridled praise when oh that's because i think i said i'd watch that i i remember
that it had reese with a spoon in it was yeah it did she became a lawyer to try and prove that
she's not retarded i think was it right it's something like early 2000s comedy movie so yeah
finally i'm free of this trilogy i couldn't have done it without you all
it are i guess good stuff yeah palpitine survived the death star explosion by climbing into a 50s
refrigerator yep it makes the most sense i don't know well they're gonna need to animate that now
everything was a dream afterward wake up from the refrigerator and it was all a dream it was like
wait bridge was 37 years ago um where do you guys stand is rise worse than tlj
it's all up in the air right now it's just so hard to it's just this blur of bad yeah
yeah i've decided that tlj is worst uh now that we've established falling can't kill people in star
wars i want the lucas cut of tros where mace windu breaks down the door to finally drug palpitine to
stand drag palpitine to stand trial before the senate no you just kill him establish shit out of
him hello mauler what's your least favorite character from the lord of the rings movies
because a friend of mine said that Frodo is her least favorite because he's whiny and a sissy
which i don't agree why he is sissy least favorite character it's so hard to say a least
favorite from lord of the rings they're all so good yeah i guess denethal he's like an ass
i mean none of the main fellowship absolutely not none of the main fellowship are on that list
denethal will be my pick until i can think of something better i guess
or something worse in this context i can't say
this just says good entertainment here all right good stuff i'm glad how much has tfa part three
been changed because of ros quite significant portions um i'd say almost half because this is
the whole part where i start talking about silo talking to this tismy vader mask and now i actually
have answers on whether or not it's vader's voice definitively so i have to rewrite that bit
um that's fucking stupid but hey yeah oh god uh next tros stream can go over tlj defenders tweets
oh we've we've covered a couple of them here and there we've also covered a bunch of the videos
it's been exciting horrifying whichever one you want to go with also people saying grima has an
option the reason i'm not as willing to choose him is because he has a small bit of redemption
you know the stab at you with mr starman
uh maybe they would have ruined it more about disney who ruined everything
they've made some stuff at some point that's not horrible which disney did they oh of course they
have it's been a while wow yeah i mean when it comes to yeah it has yeah when you think about it
what was the last excellent pixar movie probably wally yeah i'm not sure that i'd put anything else
between there that i would consider to be excellent yeah i wouldn't know well i think
some people really liked inside out i mean i like inside out like i i enjoyed it but
yeah there was there was stuff about inside out that i just didn't think was very well done
um but i haven't watched it in a while so yeah what about disney's like main animation studio
what have they done obviously up a lot of people like to reference to i like yeah i like oh i do
well the thing is i'm not saying that the ones that came afterwards were bad i think there are
some good ones in there i just don't think that they've reached the same level quality
that's what i would say yeah i can agree with that
uh jay is right i have a live in position live in a position as a nurse on the weekends 24 hour
shift include sleep hug jay thank you guys for the content hi moolah hello i was the one that
suggested that it included sleep jay boo to jay even though he probably suggested it too but still
boo to jay boo boo don't hug jay uh i say that tlj is worse because i had to fight sleep in the
middle of that one i don't know that could be considered a positive that's a good argument i
guess it's it is the longest i think it's the longest jam tlj wait no it was yeah it's too
fast keeps that yeah no you're right you're right uh i use uh i watched named yum fa made his own
song then used the copyright deadlock by copyright claiming his own song so he could use copyrighted
material in his videos and still make some money youtube yeah i've heard about that that's brilliant
wow man this system is fucked isn't it it's so fucked uh one of the nights of ran carried
gimli's war axe i imagine something that looks similar i guess but if kylo knew ray was going
to the death star it means he knew the tracker thing was there why didn't he take it earlier
i don't think we knew that he just used following hair and um i suppose the film would try and argue
that he didn't know which specific room on the death star it was in which is dumb as fuck because
they were to search the shit out of that place by now and the fact that it's probably in the first
place you'd think to look you're like right next to the emperor's throne room maybe oh look there
it is but um yeah no a lot of it doesn't make any sense let's put the whole characters thing
aside there are two major law tisms in tlj the holdo sacrifice and yoda lightning in tros
has at least like 10 well that's why i said space battles were destroyed by tlj
and forced ghosts but the force in general is destroyed by tros and um a majority of the
biggest tisms of tros can come down to basically fucking with the force you got the the healing
the teleport the skype call fights um the healing people to life like all of them are
the force and they really fucking ran with it in that film didn't they
and i like how the people who used to say like you won't let the force evolve
about tlj in this one they're like no you went too far
you hypocrites let it evolve you pieces of shit
uh dear chat can i get a i know for those brave gentlemen for watching all the disney trilogy
at actually paying for a ticket shame on you you gave disney even more money unlimited power zap
i didn't do that shit i mean i would always feel justified that i stopped a whole bunch of people
from having watched it therefore i think i'm it's a net game is it true uh i view the new trilogy
like a highway pile up that's very generous of you i gotta love how they keep poaching from the
eu yeah a lot of people usually cite that it's like there's this story they've basically
photocopied it and it looks like shit after decanonizing it and then claiming they have
nothing to work with because that's just that's what they do i love that statement so we have
nothing to work with it's like pretty much like that's i don't even know where to start
um lamb's laptop is this supposed to be alfred
fucking ralph video is this supposed to be alfred you punched him he's cartoony character punched
him for no reason i'm not a raisin didn't small ships need those ring things from the prequels
to hyperspace i mean uh obi-wan ship did um but you wouldn't necessarily be limited to that
uh with every little there's a lot of tismy stuff because like as people pointed out
tie fighters aren't supposed to be able to go to hyperspace but they just do in the sequel films
then uh i don't know man to keep track of so fucked i guess there are now two sith homeworlds
as corriban uh the original sith homeworld is in clone wars which is canon also high rages
like corriban corriban i think they've changed the name though to like something else i'm
pretty sure they like the name corriban yeah the name's cool corriban corriban
so is this an out of season april fools joke i don't know what i was referencing i'm going
to assume it was the movie uh that's doom eternal no i'm not doom eternal uh
what the hell diablo yeah yeah but i'm talking about what it was referencing and
you know like what they weren't talking where would they brought the context to elsewhere
doom eternal you're looking good yeah man i'm really excited for that one
your take on the old new female fight club reboot nothing what are you fucking kidding me
that has to be a lie please tell me that that's not dude i can't remember something about this
oh my god no come on like why wouldn't be pissed about this it's like we have to do what we have to
do what they did except with women's like make your own fucking movie it'll be fine
fight club was specifically about men like it's not this isn't like some other thing where you
just swapped it like this movie was about men you can't all right an indie film coming out in 2020
called chick fight tells the story of an all-female fight club and we're intrigued the new movie will
star malin ackerman bella thorne and alec boldwin okay so they're not just remaking fight club with
women it's just gonna buy it's what i mean it's called it's called chick fight oh okay that's
that's fine but as long as there's not some tyler durden knockoff like yeah as long as there's not
time skylar durden or some shit
give me some ideas people saying as long as i don't do that people saying jj tried he tried to
get more money fuck him he was successful he got more money fuck him so how'd that do in the box
office anyway but it's definitely not performed how they wanted it to they made a billion
yeah but that doesn't mean anything didn't force awake on like two billion
force awake is there to build yeah and plus opportunity cost and plus what you projected
like yeah it's not it yeah it should theoretically have been above two billion um so yeah that goes
to show what they did yeah it's funny because a lot of people a lot of people look at it and go
this is tier this is the rise of skywalker being bad but nobody wants to say well maybe tlj hurt
all future box office for our star wars i mean that's always what we theorize is like the damage
will be seen after it uh we saw a little bit in solo obviously like oh you were reactionary and
look at how that went for you it's like no guys there was no winning this one i don't think well
this stills parroting that it's gonna age well that movie's like no what no uh 26 15 in the eu
there was a star destroyer with a mini death star dish except it could only crack a continent even
the eu's tisms had more common sense than rise of skywalker i mean yeah that's more reasonable but
it's that's still kind of bad i don't want it yeah because it's just like okay so stack a whole
bunch of them at once can you blow up a planet then he's like oh don't do it don't do it so er
would you keep kora single at the end of legend of kora or have her get with someone my gay question
is this i would tear up with anybody that would just be too mean uh if it's the latter would it be
boland marco asami or a new character at least with boland we saw them go out on a date
maybe just keep her with marco i guess but it would yeah it's just too stupid out of way
it's making you sick just thinking about it yeah matchmaker er
give up on star wars after rogue one mino suffer oh they gave up on it after that yeah
you still suffer through tfa so ha
palps said cheating death was a power only one has achieved was he referring to himself
already knowing that power also does this tie the prequels good in general
uh wait are you saying that like that helps the prequels by having that happen in the sequels
no i don't see how it helps at all no that's yeah let's just say no
anyone else feel like they were missing scenes oh and ride the skywalker for sure
oh god yeah it was clearly a wholesome thing cut with the uh the jana girl um with lando
that was super awkward yeah admitting uh the forest thing from fin yeah i subscribed today
and turned on notifications i thought i was subscribed what a freaking idiot i am gentlemen
thank you for the entertainment no problemo subjectively is seven eight or nine worst off
the top of your head uh strictly from enjoyment uh eight is the tlj is the worst for me in terms
of enjoyment yep yeah for enjoyment i would say that too the fucking dower and the counter bite
bullshit last like 10 years um this efap is brought to you from rage shadow legends oh my goodness
there's 10 million downloads and it's got epic super cool graphics tell me about the best part
and it's gotten immersed in the first part it's totally free oh my god it's free play with me on
uh on my account that i definitely use it didn't create just this you know those deals that they're
getting are really lucrative i'm tired of jj wasn't left any notes or johnson wasn't left
any notes thing ridley scott didn't leave any notes to cameron yet he made a superior sequel
oh careful you know piss off a lot of people don't say that's a razor fist let's say that
to a lot of people a lot of people very sensitive about that the alien versus aliens debate will
forever never end but no i agree like uh aliens is a fantastic sequel uh considering everything
you know if that was to happen today i'd be like no they'll fuck it up they'll absolutely fuck it
up just completely fuck it up chick fight is apparently a comedy though the funniest thing
is somebody already owns chick fight calm and it's what you think it is oh
makes sense uh worst build up to pay off ratio white walkers or first order white walkers
no question yeah first order it's no no like first order would even built up
they always weren't they were just there it was like oh hey okay
uh even the continent cracker ship eclipse was like a thicker vision of the super star destroyer
to mount that super laser it also used to be twice the length of the executor but the executor got
buffed with the eclipse didn't so it's just thick not longer okay that's fine
uh do you think it'd be better or worse if ray parted the water up to the death star ala moses
i mean why not why the fuck not at this point yeah i'd certainly laugh my ass over it
hiya chaps pretty sure luke uses light speed in the ot to get to and from daygubber
merry christmas to all um i'm pretty sure everyone's fine with x-wings having uh
hyperspace because uh they use they definitely use them a bunch in um don't they use them in
a new hope to get to the desk no they don't use it in that because they i don't think there's
ever an x-wing doing it in new hope but i should tell them use it in uh return of the jedi for sure
so uh we have to like we're all i think everyone's okay with x-wings having the ability to go into
hyperspace it was it was tie fighters specifically i believe but perhaps there was a misspeak uh
vitiate or vitiate vitiate the old republic sith emperor called thousands of sith to a planet
and then conducted a ritual to sacrifice everyone on the planet for immortality sounds like a
reasonable cost good for him i guess yeah i love disrail and the jedi i don't know what in the eu
that's probably referencing uh will this super chat be read on the 67th i wonder the 67th
try 70th that's what i go right out uh also now that you've watched tros you have no more excuses
to avoid hardcore henry you dumbos oh it's that guy again we got loads of folks watch shit on the
list uh i've got hardcore henry and i keep forgetting to watch it i think i might just
make these 70 and 71 because we basically cover all of ralph's video in the first portion and
this is all super chance so it makes sense in terms of first splitting them up it's just a bit
of ralph at the beginning of this one uh whoever said aliens is better than alien fight me irl
i train ufc you fig tree you didn't stand a chance wreath well you don't stand a chance
indiana jones and the last star wars law in fortnite
yeah that's how you know that we're in a great position in terms of media right now
very very fantastic are you happy quick play porkins theme
organ's theme be oh what would porkins theme even be
one for the for the annals of history i suppose uh whole movie doesn't make babu freaking sense
got him got him this trilogy was the execution of count duku the red lightsaber was the last jedi
the blue lightsaber was the rise of skywalker and count duku was a fan base and it was split into a
body and a head i suppose yep is this something there metaphorically i think
uh good to see you guys are still at it now we'll see if you are still around
once i'm done running errands stay along my n-words yes ma'am uh it's just a movie about
space wizards made for kids i never show my kids these movies as they are insulting on so many
levels don't want your kids to be dumb they're meant for those children gosh darn it
uh maula have you seen a philosophy of kraya video so i don't really want to watch that until
i play the koto games and i don't know when i'm going to play them so it's a infinite cycle i
suppose but uh i know of them who's your friend that just won't die palpatine
yeah pretty much that could be a decent sort of like a sitcom yeah sitcom thing
okay uh my roommate liked dlj and hated solo he thinks the fans ruined star wars i
shared the rape palpatine spoiler and he hated it said he's basically done
a lot of people are who are those leaks man
uh the end of the dt has brought back a lot of prequel haters plink it backlash when
oh the disney trilogy that was um i mean i i don't know what's the conversation about all
of the saga is fucking insane at this point i guess in terms of figuring out just how good
all of them are because like there was a set of essays that came out i think i mentioned this
before about how like tlj was better than we thought it wasn't i guess it was though no
i'm thinking of plinkett are they uh are they done doing plinkett
i don't think so i think he's still going just really slow on delivery which is not something
i can complain about nor can er yeah i mean the uh the title of the last jedi video seemed concerning
to me is that the last plinkett review and i'm wondering hmm is that uh subtlety yeah i think he
did say wasn't the end of that just that he was done um yeah and he said that he recommended
boycotting the next film yeah um but we'll see we'll see cots
i just got back from seeing tros again shad was right forced storm is tisme i've been dead before
caused two people to burst out laughing behind me why did you see it again yeah well we had one
but all right hi to horns maybe he was forced to maybe forced the force brought him i get it
this trilogy can be summed up perfectly by han solo himself saying that's not how the force works
pretty much yeah tros ripped off the goonies with that knife shit
agreed hello everyone hello mola did you see the animation palpatine's journey it's pretty funny
i did great oh is that the one where he gets dumped out of the ship yeah yoda you old sponge
dad i would like you to be
uh i'm writing this at six a.m in sweden having uh been up having a blast listening the entire
time can't wait for the ihe video to be released also high rag yeah that should be next episode
that will do that and it's not fucking controversial it's something that he's he wants well he's happy
to release so it's all happy tismes all right uh dave falloni is crying himself to sleep he's
the only one who gets the force they seeded so many ideas and rebels and jj straight up just tldr
tldw'd oh too long didn't watch the rebels yeah oh well uh what kind of tea do you drink rags
i will save that for him do you think the mouse will eventually reboot the original trilogy
i hate that prospect so much
actually horrifying and like they recast all the characters that'll be so horrifying
uh they'll just bring them back as cg oh
this really like the final fantasy spirits within shit
even lucas can't do a thing about it if they did it in 20 years yep
um i feel dirty that i had to watch a fortnight video to listen to palpatine speech we all did
love how even the msm is against disney now
are they yeah i don't know are they i don't really think so oh it's that guy again i have
a day baller i don't have names on the backlog ones because i obviously i just copied over the
the messages to make sure i got them because this fucking notepad file is getting smaller but it's
still fucking enormous getting there uh i agree with shad man on the healing thing they should
have used it like the sort of truth series terry goodkind where healing was highly debilitating
and took several days to accomplish and left them exhausted yeah i'm okay with that make it punishing
um especially with you know don't make it like immediate at all the spot because fuck me like
fights become a little less intense at that point is there any hope at all for hulu's hitchhiker's
guide to the galaxy probably not i didn't know that they were making that yeah whenever there's
something new just assume it's not going to be good and then you can be pleasantly surprised
that's what i do i'm always proven right you uh did an eight hour shoot and then you can
did an eight hour shift and you're still live hi rags these are collecting up
we just say all of those to rags uh when leah died i yelled when that cocaine hits and then
i walked out for a refund okay i like poe he should have left with zoria got her pragas
top t of viewing right there uh disney already remade the ot it was called tfa
oh no they'll do it even more insidiously than that
they'll be like hey how about we remake it but just actually remake it this time he was like no
maybe tros's ending was a dream that's life that's life i just i think the credit should
have instead of being like directed by jj was the first thing you see it should have been we're sorry
uh when chewy had leah died and shoved off the new crew i almost teared up the only real moment in
this movie yeah and it's not it doesn't belong to this film it belongs to the ot that moment
just the idea of chewy dealing with all the big dead there's not even a seed between uh chewy
and luke yeah there's like one between chewy and leah in the sql trilogy i think
and then chewy and han yeah you've got a little bit there
uh is i am correct going to review oh wait sorry yeah chewy does say hello to luke at one point
in tlj my bad okay everything's better now yeah uh is i am correct going to review your script
be all unbridled rage just in case you have a mistake in it also high rags i think that's
referencing uh i had everything was proof his script was yeah he said like his script was
unfocused about his tlj video and that that was one that uh tro proofed such a bizarre
sequence of events that whole thing yeah that was that was pretty nuts uh po plus zori bliss equals
babu frick yeah biologically that makes complete sense trying to get over the flu thank you
massives for the content and keep up the great work thank you we're still going around there
nobody lost a hand in tlj zero out of ten trilogy try again
you think future star wars films will be easily treated as reboots with no plot connections to
past films possibly yeah you have no idea where they're gonna go with this especially after that
weird comment from uh kathleen kennedy about how like they want to move away from trilogies who's
like huh good luck what are you gonna do now and it's like just stuff just gonna throw stuff out
what's the rationale for literally no one in the original and prequel trilogies not jumping to
light speed inside of a gravity well fuck you disney star wars because they didn't like no
they they were stupid and it was really unlikely okay it was like one in a million and that's what
i've heard okay they all they want crazy the bells made them crazy oh no not the bells
good morning long man oh that's applicable good morning and good night rags keep that good
afternoon shad question if all of you could choose a lightsaber color what would it be
and single or double blade i think we answered that question before
mine would probably be single and i really like purple
mine would be mine yeah
single green for you single red for me
wow you sith you evil man i think shad said he'd want red and that shouldn't be considered evil
we're taking it back here's a uh here's a total non sequitur um apparently there's a recording
of trump where he is specifically saying that he's worried about bernie sanders and he'd prefer
going up against biden i think that makes sense recording it's a recording of him saying this
effectively and he said that it would have been harder in 2016 if bernie was a vp like if hillary
clinton to pick bernie um i'm yeah who was it maybe i i don't know who fucking knows i can't
remember our political system fucking retarded it's all bad let me see if i can find a quote
specifically yeah this is this is what he this is him this is what he literally said if she pins
bernie as vice president it would have been tougher i think bernie because all those people
that hated her so much who voted for me trump said adding that he got 20 of the bernie vote
because sanders was a big trade guy but had she picked bernie sanders it would have been tougher
he's the only one he was the only one i didn't want her to pick um so that's interesting
um he stuck a knife in his back him came i hope he wins i hope that bernie wins because it's just
going to be the most interesting thing ever is no i i think i don't think that's even a question is
it like bernie would obviously put up more of a fight than biden uh well it seems like the tables
are turning i think uh bernie is doing better in like the early caucus states like new hampshire
and uh iowa so um and oh and you might not know about this uh pete brooder judge had a bit of a
jeff bush please clap moment oh yeah yeah he's like oh you know you're gonna get passionate come on
yeah i've seen people play the clips side by side
yeah well i mean let's let's look look up the uh let's look up the democratic primary polls
sorry this won't say yeah do we have to people like us for not being very political oh yeah sure
fair enough yeah it's like can we talk about light sabers and how bad things are elsewhere
i was going to run from lightsabers to trump this is bernie took away one
what what lightsaber do you suppose they'll get that'd be a really cool flight wouldn't it yeah
that's i mean i'd watch it election is yeah dude the election now is who can win the lightsaber
fight perfect two of the fights where you don't wow i feel like i feel like whoever i said is
like dot mold will it will be interpreted as political so i've probably got Hillary Clinton
and then stabs on stabs if you had to delete one european country and its people from existence
what would you choose why why what's the question sorry you can delete one european country and its
people from existence which would you choose what i'm not answering that that's so mean
i'm not i don't know i don't know how i would figure that out i guess it'd go for like the
smallest one i don't know you're the one with no people yeah like if you had to
yeah take out that uh area where this is bugging no houses just grass uh first super chat thanks
for all the streams you masses you're helping me process all the tism i just watched you've
genuinely made a big difference in my life helping me decipher what makes good slash bad rat i love
you all hi rags hi j hi j well thanks for the message but why would you say hi to j quick kick
j jesus thank you uh imperial slash final slash first order scenes were pretty cool weren't they
no they're embarrassing silly when he bursts his own ships up from the floor it's just like what the
fuck uh eight kylo your parents are nobody ray they were nobody i've always thought why didn't
she ask him uh where are they and what's wrong with nobody parents because because tlj is way
too obsessed with the meta like characters don't behave as they would they behave react as if they're
star they're like watching the star wars episodes like of course ray wouldn't give a fuck if her
parents we're or we're not a skywalker or canobie because she's already powerful it doesn't matter
if she's from a powerful family she'd want to know these people that's why it's so dumb yeah
spaceships are meant to be in space in disney star wars they spend more time fighting on
atmosphere than anywhere else they even rise from the ground now it's true i think we see the
more in atmosphere than out in uh riser skywalker well they had to do that right because in atmosphere
you can't have a shield except when you've got a speeder fly up oh you can't fly up and when you run
out of petrol you know your ship just like stalls like it's a car even though it starts i can't
believe that you put all three of these tisbee movies together and everything's fucked like
nothing makes any sense and they're like stalls never made any sense like oh fuck off you have no
idea what you're talking about it's fantasy easy delete sea land problem solved sea land yes if we
delete all of the sea we'll be fine right that won't affect earth in any dramatic way dramatic
way that's a new word dramatic
kyle band's last words to ray no refunds
yeah like she dies to save him he dies to save her she dies to save it just waiting for someone
else to turn up that could save both of them they rise now f a c e face arms speech some
cash for rags stroke treatment get some sleep mauler oh this is from the overflow and yet it's
applicable to now hey i don't know i'm not sure how much longer i can last now but this overflow
we have uh would you step back and look at it in a different perspective you're like oh shit
the overflow is only once again been shipped away at it's still if i can get it if you could put
into like a time frame with minimal interruptions how long would you say that would take
four hours damn dude you might need another uh you might need another separate stream for that
shit oh well that's the thing we can do that and and you know i think the next stream will be a
pretty good one for it as well because we're not actually covering a video we've got four different
uh paper-based stuff i'm calling it the efap taxes stream we're gonna be
it's gonna be great entertain and the mdi hate everything conversation obviously
oh yeah yeah yeah the most anticipated i haven't oh sorry i was about to mock somebody
i was about to mock somebody i mean go ahead if you want to go ahead well you're committed now
not well i mean you're all aware of the uh the bad bunny thing right where she's bitching about
not getting enough money from twitch oh yeah yes yeah it's just it's just funny how like
she's there complaining that she's not getting enough in here you're like running out of time
to get through everything i mean it's just a weird position to have taken because it's like
hey bad bunny you're aware that like thousands upon thousands of people are providing this
content for free every day too you're not the only one and like what entitles you to it because
people are enjoying it it's like i mean the assumption there is the you know twitch start
out as just being like hey play some games and talk to people who like games that's wholesome
and she's like payback i just love the part where she's like i haven't got a donation or
a sub at an hour and then she's got this like indignant sort of faces like how do you look
back on this and go yeah this is fine this is good this is the way to behave did she apologize
for it i assume she did did it look terrible uh did she no i said like assume i don't know if she
did i just assumed that would have been the right thing to do or to talk about how it's
taken out of context she probably did that bye uh and then there was a video of uh there was i
don't know who it was but there was another twitch streamer who was there saying that it was the she
was getting targeted by incels okay his logic was that um oh well she's an attractive woman
who didn't act nice so that's what makes incels really angry it's so stupid okay more here's a
completely new question if you had to choose one european country to not be deleted besides yours
which one would you choose see but i can just easily answer the biggest one for my save the
humans russia yeah yeah russia's fucking enormous are you gonna be able to get away with that well
the problem i suppose is people would be like wouldn't you want to preserve what you think is
the best culture i guess or like this is the thing i would have to go research which one is
the most important to the world i guess and then weigh that up against the human lives that are
lost like that's pretty fucking horrifying questions it's not like joke answer uh love you
guys can't wait for you to finish the breakdowns of tfa and the newest star wars abortion mauler
your rage on ros was fantastic well done but thank you very much the most anticipated defap
of them all a few days before christmas that's proof there's a center objectively may the season
and don bless you all why thank you may he bless you as well the cat's visual effects
improvements the first time video game patch culture crept into our movie screens not the
last time i'm calling it now yeah i gotta wonder how much this trend is going to keep going because
they did it with the sonic movie even well cats is the first vision of a fucking day one patch
for movies that's fucking insane okay welcome back here hey cats lost about
150 million dollars didn't it it's like a massive failure
i i would love to be a fly on the wall in that meeting you know without pitching cats and they're
like let's go for like people who are cgi cats but they're people that's gonna go over great
this isn't creepy and when they did that first trailer cut the editor somehow managed to push
right yeah so it had a budget of 80 to 100 million dollars and it's made 62 million dollars
not including marketing oh yeah that's uh and it had a stacked cast as well so
i mean that's that seems to be the recurring theme with movies now is it doesn't even really
matter who the cast is a lot of the time it's like people are starting to wise up to it just
don't care anymore yeah i think yeah like it's good the performance is good please yes
calling for trump's 40d chess mini game shake my head that pinko commie scum has no chance
and i will fillet rags if i'm wrong well all right well what was the most wasted concept
for me it was the knights a four sniper sounds opie as fuck also you think kylo
hands ray brain bran muffins while she's pooping
i'm gonna say yes to that and as for the most wasted thing um
like like is the like the question of what new element do they bring that you feel they wasted
i'd just be like i don't know don't feel so pretty up there it all feels so empty though
like the knights have ran and nothing yeah i don't know maybe just no characterization in general
just characterization overall yeah you know what fin i feel like he's the most wasted thing in the
sequels dude fin got fucked his arc was going to be perfect until jay if he was actually allowed
to die it could have been really good he could have had a really good arc and they've blown up
many times and the thing is like they didn't need him anymore in the third movie so it would have
just been absolutely perfect and just not have him in it at all no but we gotta we gotta fight the
bad guys by crashing into each other yeah and i'm not saying i didn't like fin he was a good
character it's just he was a waste in the third one so oh he was a good character i like fin but
you don't like fin no i do i like jon boyega i don't like fin that much
i like the idea of fin i like the idea of fin but yeah um
anakin doesn't like sand ray burries his lightsaber and fucking sand also imagine
halpertine fuck somebody do it do do do eye rags and hail the god emperor of man
all right i guess i'll save that and there's a shad question i'll save as well ray one because
she crossed the beams it only makes sense do you think that they were trans jedi
who knows i'm sure that question will be answered in future the future
uh holdo e equals 0.5 times mv power of two certain distance acceleration possible rogue one
one ship bounced others went hyperspace tlj all about keeping precise distance
one minute i'm sorry i'm not entirely sure of what it was i'm so lost huh yeah i should probably
i think i should stop reading these now because my brain started to be melted well i don't i just
don't think that one made any sense i think the message just doesn't make any sense
wow guys could have been my brain melted but fine uh maybe old palps was into shock therapy kink
and it just just forgot he forgot the safe word that's what i was
he couldn't say the safe word his lips were melting up
uh not the final order used high fighters to fly up nope nope jj and fabro are always being
executed excused sorry not executed for their tism episodes in star trek and mandalorian
remember vince gilligan in breaking bad when his was one vision
uh yeah i'm not sure what you mean by that well so i guess they're saying they're good episodes
people try and excuse them for their bad ones but who thought jj had any good star trek movies i
thought they hated all of them from what i understand a lot of people yeah i did every single one
oh i was under the impression that the first time jj abrams did a star trek movie people liked it
no i'm pretty sure trek fans hated it i think it was well reviewed but that doesn't mean anything
i think i think the book was well reviewed the public liked it yeah for the most part
like i found it entertaining there's like critics critics it's yeah it just kind of reminds me of
halo where like i remember i watched the ign clip where someone said halo 4 was not well received
which is an accurate statement but because it's ign they're all like oh no everybody liked it we
liked it we gave it to 9.7 it's like guys like nobody plays this game nobody likes this game
just because you and your friends like it doesn't mean anything so that was a bit of a halo tangent
yeah
yeah actually i'm i'm pretty lost-ismed and i'm up to where i was supposed to be which is actually
what would have been the cap for for the for the stream or at least i've gone over it but hey
uh this time we don't have to deal with that because we're uh split into two yeah the um
we took a big old chunk out of the overflow uh like i said rags and i will chop that thing
down until it's gone it was like a collective of four streams or something that just didn't
get accounted for because of other events but we're getting there if you so if you stream that one
are you also going to have to go through the super chats of that stream too yeah so we did
with the when we did super chat catch-up two it was uh we did as many overflows as we could while
also answering the ones in that stream damn dude they're trying to slow you down yeah we're gonna
get there though and by the way when i finally get through this entire overflow it's gonna i'm gonna
be like fucking did it killed it i did defeated it ryan johnson gay good one and fuck mary kill
chewy jj sheave what a strange selection of three um wait what was that again chewy jj
sheave for fuck mary kill mary chewy yeah fuck palpatine kill jj i'm sorry jj it's the process
of elimination buddy like what can we do yeah the hands were tied um so yeah in terms of updates
for just stuff that's coming uh wolf recorded all of the overflowed super chats that were meant for
him it's like a four hour recording that's already on mooler it's going to be released
in like a timely-ish fashion of i don't know a good time to come out i guess so if you had
sent a super chat him directed at him on his last stream he will have heard and he'll be reacting
to them i guess then there's like another four hour one we recorded we were looking at like
30 to 40 copyrighted uh meme videos and laughing and different things ensue you'll be able to see
that one soon after it's like it's like a part one part two the doom efap movies has been appealed
and it's allowed to stay up it's just they monetized it which whatever or they said it
can't be monetized at all either way it's up which means lord the rings will be on its way
it's just the two towers is being finicky so and we want to release them probably weekly it'd be
a nice little trilogy so doom went down about six or seven times didn't it six or seven hundred yeah
hundred yes um then there's the two more infinitisms episodes they're still being edited so
hoping to get it out on time but if it can't be it can't be it'll just be delayed and then
we're recording the two episodes about woman that will be watching so we haven't seen the
one that came out yet probably tuesday or wednesday and then i'm finishing video editing
my april fools video and das bullshit is editing the other one i sure am that would be once those
are done obviously those they'll just be waiting for april and then after that i will be rescripting
tfa part three i'm working on that and then i think my plan right now unless things change will
be to do a joker video after that what about uh when's the ihg discussion coming out that
would be next effap which will probably be next week and i don't even know if we'll have guests
for that because i don't know if it'll make sense to have guests when we're trying to do something
like that that's true um and that is the update uh rags is doing a mandalorian video but he wants
to do the effap stream before doing that so we're going to sort that out after the uh the i ate
everything one and so that there'll be a mandalorian stream we're gonna do the sargon one i think
they're in potential talks with elvis the alien to have him guest for a full episode same from
a skeptic um a bunch of other people we'll have to see what happens cool i don't think if there's
anything else like all of the updates i can think of i think rags has said he's making a response
to somebody else as well so that's possibly on the way and um yeah thank you all very much
for uh for watching and i hope you enjoyed ralph's video was really bad um and that'll be going up
much sooner than this half because obviously it's uh it's already processed i imagine by now so i
can get it up and down well down and up straight away yep um and yeah that's that's about it uh
i'll read the last one fuck with f word barry kill uh jj ryan and kathleen yeah i just find it
funny that the last one said fuck this one said f word so kill kathleen she's out uh
uh
killed them all yeah i was gonna say this is unfair
too rough
i feel like this needs some time you'd have to think about this one
yeah like the justifications would be so complicated wouldn't they because you'd be
like you'd have to just it would be a lesser of two evils for like every single choice
um i had to do this because of this i had to do this because of this i don't know
kill kill kill as as bunsky recommended yes okay uh mary jj kill ryan and fuck kathleen oh well
that might that might just be what you have to do yeah it could be you you held a gun to my head
i had to choose yeah um all right so thanks for watching everybody i think that's it we'll we'll
come back next time and like i said we'll take another chunk out of the overflow if if you're
still waiting for things you've said to be read out hopefully it's in there and it will be gotten
to uh other than that anything else anybody wants to say before before close out no i'm good
nope all right oh always happy to be here uh everybody's uh all you toxic broodmen are the
best oh yeah thanks for popping in all three of you to keep me company while i read superchats
infinitely into the void absolutely yep uh and obviously thanks to uh j and literature devil
and rag zoos for uh a fun fun stream we shall see you next week folks toodle pip
here we go toodles later
