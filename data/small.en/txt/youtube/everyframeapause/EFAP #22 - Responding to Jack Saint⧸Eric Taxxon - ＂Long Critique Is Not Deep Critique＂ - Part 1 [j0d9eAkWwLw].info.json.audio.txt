and the proceed we shall after war the episode 22 of you fat even though
technically the gaming is gonna be a separate thing now we separate episodes
okay we're professionals you can't you can't mix up video responses with gaming
that's fucked up it's just it's a video response of sorts it's almost like a
theory like a video response theory oh dude you remember when that was a
potential name for this podcast what a coincidence that you'd say that I
remember that it's almost like I intentionally said it for that very
reason almost but almost yeah you fucked it up well if you almost got there I
know you've been less subtle more of it someone's already said Jared theory how
can they not beautiful yeah let me get the link so I can post dang yeah if app
number 22 Wow cool why since sins are not TRO I TRO is currently ill and on
holiday as far as I'm aware so because we like since ends more hey Jay you
should appreciate that you haven't seen Lord the rigs that he said that yeah I
do appreciate that I'm literally gonna write that on my ego for like three
years at the least I gotta give you a little bone before the debate where I
just completely only that's the only like you got wait you think he has no
more bones he has normal bones all right the kind of condition I was born
without any bones it's a miracle I'm still alive I'm just a jelly like body
flopping around I am I'm completely like gelatinous substance people carry me
around and just like like a bucket the guy that you see in my face cams is an
actor and I'm just like a blob in the corner directing him well who's to say
that any of us are not that how would you know hmm he dances to my tune like a
puppet on string if you want that I hope if you really think about it aren't we
all just blobs in the corner off camera aren't we all just gelatinous Bob's
blobs we're just gelatinous Bob's is that an offensive buckets attack on
movie Bob is that what you know no he's got a bone in there somewhere is that an
ad hominem is that I mean I've seen him stand he's been on camera he stood he
might just be like rigid jello that's been in the you know like been out left
on the counter too long because he's been around for a while which is why
you still stand him up I don't know what movie Bob looks like is he fat you're
like guys your insults better be accurate no I because I mean I don't
like fat people so it'll help me hate him more well what's your thing against
thin people then because you've got again salted thin people as well well
thin people are better than fat people like objectively they I mean there's a
lot of status you could actually apply that to so you wouldn't be you'd be
objective in saying that right oh god a wild Eric appeared for a brief moment oh
yeah with Santa oh wait I guess I shouldn't put that video first we got a
different video to do why do I have to explain why it's not on Thursday ask
mauler what oh well because it was wolf told us thousand years next free but it
turns out it was Monday like he got it what was it like you just thought you
were working Monday and you weren't yeah I was like well I may as well throw it
out there in case I didn't actually think we were gonna do it and then well
here we are yeah I just figured that you were busy I thought I was too but my
boss doesn't like to give me hours so blame his boss is is the excuse yes
exactly maybe if you were jello you could get your your check from the
government because there's a lot of jobs you can't do if you don't have bones but
surely there's a lot of jobs you can do better yeah like like I imagine if you
didn't have bones you could swim really well because you could like wiggle like
octopus yeah this is the car we all just occupy if we really think about it we're
out to play with I'm not an octopi you can be a really good skydiver if you
were made out of jello because you could like turn your body into one big
parachute I was just thinking of like a like an amorphous blob of flesh like
turning over itself as it plummets to the earth that would pick up speed but
the jello would probably break apart as it slowly stops loses speed like there'd
be like little flesh bubbles falling around that do you think we don't want
to think too much about this could you milk a boneless rhino absolutely I mean
it would be a little harder on this you would have to roll it over I assume I
guess well would it have a horn would it would it still have a horn would it
horn would be like a little one might say a little deflated like balloon
animal just like attached to its face Nicholas McMurray said as a fat I befed
you should be mr. fat you can I'm fat you can counter it out as long as you've
seen Lord of the Rings you'll get a few points for that someone said we first
had Jay Longbone now Jay boneless I got a boneless whale should be cast into the
sea oh my god that's a whale whales are already in the sea that's true these
whales off my damn property just make sure you don't go near the sea of Japan
that you might get harpoon and shit you know I forgot to do and I said in the
last stream we're gonna get to doing it what Jay who will be the most
inconsistent character of episode 9 when it releases the end of this year Finn
okay that's three votes for Finn now all right the Finn has been so
inconsistent so far that if he were consistent in episode 9 that itself
would be an inconsistency that's actually what my argument is pretty much
as well because he's he's a mess but I actually do think that it could
literally be anybody because it's a shame as well series John Boyega is so
good yeah no I think I think he's he's actually pretty emotes like crazy and
enforce awakens and lost Jedi it's just that he's playing such a I don't even
know how to describe Finn as a character as a whole it's like he's a he's
something I don't know what you mean I literally was actually just trying to
find a way that would suit it that's specific resist fighter that's yes see
that was the way I was going for you nailed it so oh yeah so like an update
a part one of the aliens clone Marines stream got a copyright claim but we were
lucky in that it only monetizes it but Disney it didn't take it down which is
funny is me hold on why would Disney monetize
the meme with Rogue One it was specifically and in the in the in the
clip they have of it it shows me pause and play and it's like damn it didn't
manage to get through apparently I still did so that's why we still pause
that we're lucky this time but anytime they could easily just take down the
whole video depending on whatever the restrictions can be depending on how
much you know sorry someone mentioned black mantis helmet wolf I wanted to
mention that to you how the fuck does he know how to reverse engineer the
tech yeah like like I literally make a point of that in my video because I was
like so he goes back to the sub and then he starts reverse engineering the alien
technology and then I was like wait a minute what the fuck is happening cuz
it's like the movie establishes these are just pirates that like stolen
experimental submarine it's like when the fuck were you able to start reverse
engineering at Lanyon shit and second that fucking helmet is the most retarded
goddamn thing I've ever seen in my life there's a big black bar right in front
of his fucking face just keep water gun it's stupid as shit
African-american ball it's it's miniaturized death star tech shut up
I will not I will not do that no no I am working on the Aquaman video by the way
audience it's gonna be a good nice two hours don't lie to me we make a video
that long you're never gonna hold an audience doing that yeah just FYI wolf
if you're making a review that's longer than the movie it's not longer it's that
half hour actually it's 45 minutes shorter it's still wrong man is two
hours and 45 minutes I know minus two hours that's a long time to watch
Aquaman why does your video not have bones that's actually a fake question
answer my video has lots of bones you just haven't seen them yet because it's
not finished so um speaking of memes I always get that wrong yeah this this I'm
send you this link I don't know what this is exactly but a few people have
sent me it if you want to click it and give it a read through if you want rags
there's some there's some funny shit in here but uh I guess it's a wiki where
people can make profiles for anything oh I remember this one your quote is
yeah but that's your opinion rags in the comments at the bottom of the page is
ghost milk and rhino milk yeah I mean I could read it out if you want I don't
know this is the some of the some of the memes are amusing notable victories some
guy on discord I'm in the inconclusive matches er maulers trying to get him on
new fat but he's very hard to get no no more overwhelming Jared may be an
outlier as Jared is often portrayed as superior to maulers so take this feat
with a grain of salt speed unknown possibly speed of light reactions come
up with good arguments instantly it's like such a me it's like a top trump yes
yeah the favorite bit for me was the the notable quotes thing whatever I guess
this is getting updated recently to stamina very high can live stream for
up to eight hours with only a small break in between standard equipment good
arguments rhino milk I like it yeah it's cool people wanted that to be
shows like there we go and then comes we're gonna do one meme this time because
we got a longer video to respond to but I mean I don't think I have to play
pause it luckily but yeah fair warning it's a strange one but you know what's
wrong with strange one dry guys you all you all good to go oh yeah this looks
like something I haven't seen oh I'm a pretty peaceful don't believe in
unnecessary violence I just have to say that shit has gotten really out of hand
listen man to any of you who want to fight me who are man enough to fight me
fight you can do this but I'm just right now it's not gonna be good on your part
fuck let's get this over with somewhere
they're upgrading why but it makes sense why knock you and your little cut
friends down like bowling pins all right I'll snap you like a fucking kid cat
bro fuck you holy shit what a fucking
nightmare I have no words after that I like that it's just the consensus now
that rags doesn't talk he just fucking bark apparently that's over all my
contributions well he does have some lines thrown in like the and I'm rags I
like to imagine how like how someone would react to that if they'd literally
Alexa stop Alexa stop okay I have no idea what the fuck is she even saying I
don't she does that all the time by the way you have no idea how many takes I've
had to redo because she's just fucking gone on about something completely
random halfway through me talking it's kind of dude man Alex Jones was right
Alexa is taking over exactly Jay will be the first to go at least we can get this
efap done before Jay's dead you know yeah maybe well maybe you're not allowed
to die yet we have to have that debate and oh right gotta get that done too yeah
I gotta like make you feel sad at the end of it I promise that if if I feel
myself dying during the stream I'll just say arrival is great and then you
can say no it's not and then technically we had the debate Alexa I'm dying what do
I do how are you dying I don't really know I don't have Alexa but Windows 10
has Cortana Cortana what do I do did it activate you have no it's just it's just
sitting there like nothing happened Wow okay Cortana is not naked what do I do
this is the true problem it listen to me before in years pick how do I ask it
questions I thought it was supposed to just respond to Cortana what do I do I
got rid of mine so I had to type it in it's thinking you have to activate it I
all kinds of things ask me to play music well I've I know where that's going so
we're gonna stop that there we're gonna nip that right in the bud and fuck off
he's trying to recommend you music you don't like I think she's been
practicing music and she just wants to so anyway this this stream is brought to
you by Google mm-hmm Google's Alexa and Cortana go to go to Google com and
enter in code efap Monday for 16% off all Google searches kind of funny if ever
we got a sponsor because the code is usually four letters long be like efap
is easily the people like you like yes it's an abbreviation Oh wonderful I can't
look we we need a true analyst here and tonal would annihilate total look
total look is the best one we can get man I would love if he came on efap of
souls tonal come on efap we'll give you this profile picture that you can
actually use since Martin Luther King Jr. day no it's total okay look okay
so anyway this is a couple videos that have been made in relation to be at efap
just in general a bit of criticism here and there which you know we haven't done
in in a decent chunk of time we haven't done TLJ in a decent chunk of time too
the last thing if you remember was we kind of lost autism's on on what is it
called aliens colonial Marines that's the one so efap is going weird
directions but we thought as a wonderful arc since since can join us as
guesting while we check out someone's latest criticism of my channel to get
you know my take wolf stick racks takes and someone who despises my channel to
this day's take isn't that right Jay yeah I I don't know why I'm here I
dislike all of you immensely oh see well I'm literally only here to promote my
own channel at the end until then I'm just gonna half-ass it yep everyone on
sub from J he hosts cinema sins he tackles movies and he thinks they're all
bad and that's done he's done videos on Lord of the Rings even though he's
admitted he hasn't seen them so I'm not sure what that means we should really
you know do something about that maybe kill him
actually did cover movies I hadn't seen that's that's not a joke what covers
the Smurfs I did oh you did well I mean don't give a shit what I started I
covered the Smurfs movie having not seen either of them will you I mean that is
actually possible depending on the argument right I wouldn't see the emoji
movie for health reasons I I'm just sad they made Patrick Stewart a poop I'm
sad that I watched it I feel like Patrick Stewart being a poop is like the
only self-aware thing in the film that I haven't seen I just I don't know you
could go both ways without you could be like that's the point though it's so
funny treating all that talent like shit in a better movie it would be funny may
I don't know how I would do it but I I get it I understand stop taking every
single role he's presented with cuz he literally will not stop taking I would
take any role if I was that age and I wanted to just get more acting done
away the osteoporosis that's true I mean Jesus Christ he went from Logan to the
emoji movie and that's oh the emotion movie was I had a Logan I think so to
the person in chat asking who the guest is who isn't Jay that is mauler hello
hello enjoy you guys podcast I I'm glad I'm glad I'm really glad you have and I
thought instead of making a video about how wrong you are on everything I would
show you a video that does that for me and I'm gonna tell you why all of it is
correct that's what we're doing today but I also so yeah everything is wrong
with your show but I also love the show just a bit confusing wonderful those
just statement statements both work together they do is Jack aware if app is
on I don't I haven't sent him a message this I wasn't even aware this was
happening until yesterday so but um I can well I mean it'd be kind of weird at
this point what am I gonna say we're doing it now dude you know like it
doesn't really matter he was never gonna be on the part where we respond who's
always gonna be so then he can like see us just rip into his awful video live
and he can like cry why would you do that spare him why would I want to spare
we got we got there's a few there's a few general questions I'd love to get
you guys's perspective on before before we tackle this so like concerns from
from fans number one being do you have to cover all criticisms no no we don't
and we don't there's four epic we got the J one the TRO ones even though you
could kind of called out a one sequence because obviously we were just trying to
get through it what else is there like videos that are responding oh well I
guess is the Eric tax on one was three and then this one is up for like four
episodes out to because he was the worst criticisms of you well that's what you
do the the TRO one was hailed as a great takedown until we watched it was it was
awful so yeah so the idea is like you people feel concerned that we're
wasting too much time we're getting too obsessed with with criticism we've not
covered a lot of the criticism that's out there we're trying to pick the ones
that have the most reach or the most concern from fans about the criticisms
in the video being relevant and I should take note of them one of the top
comments on the video right now there's someone saying that they're a big fan of
my work and they think this is the like most honest and greatest take of what's
wrong with my channel so when stuff like that happens it's more on me to be
interested in actually like countering it or at least providing to fans what's
wrong with it it seems like a lot of people have picked up what's wrong with
it already but it's the TRO video was left alone for months and it just
festered it didn't get solved even though a lot of it was blatantly false
so we had to do it and then we did it and now it's over nobody says the TRO
video fucking slashes rags nowadays because the response will be have you
have you seen a response it's a really bad video this is like just just watch
efap 10 that's the response people get now they don't even get a counter
argument it's just watch efap 10 so yeah we do I guess we'll be kind of doing the
same thing with this one but I mean again if someone there's a lot of
criticism videos that exist of my channel and efap and rags and wolf ones
that we've seen and we go now we're not gonna address them because they're just
too stupid or ones that we haven't seen and so this is just number four and
like if we cover TLJ next episode let's say theoretically someone might be like
you always cover TLJ and be like we haven't covered it now for like over six
episodes but you know just asking you guys are clearly obsessives who makes
like multiple videos on the same topic I will never do that I haven't someone's
are you back rags are you going to do more YouTube videos like yes so one of
the top comments of one of the Clodagh Marines one was I'm starting to think
this rags guy isn't just a guest because of the fucking was it the total
bloke one I'm kidding I'm getting ID I think they're they're learning they're
gonna unravel the secret don't tell him um yeah and so so the next part then is
doesn't it take away from the entertainment value of efap and my
response will be we try to be entertaining in response to it that would
tie into the quote-unquote horrific Lee immoral and unethical insults that are
used or the snappy comebacks or snark or whatever like there's plenty of it in
the videos we actually respond to oh yes we did so and people find it very
satisfying to be presented a thing and then shown how the thing is flawed from
the base it's like oh so yeah we're trying to make it entertaining we don't
want to just give you a clinical like this is wrong because of this reference
please search for that and you will understand moving on to the next point
it's like oh let's uh let's get some energy yeah whoo-hoo all right milks
someone just rag isn't a guest rag is guess I am a guest I am a guest and then
and then the the last one that I've seen this is this is more from their
side of the other thing saying you guys just unable to accept criticism and this
is drawn from the fact that we respond to it and so it to me it's a bit of a
almost a paradox implying that if you respond to criticism you can't take
criticism yeah yeah I don't know what would you like us to do yeah that's at
that point I'm like I don't and it's like you should just ignore everyone who
says anything bad about you that's the only rational thing to do that makes
sense I like that and yeah only that was how the world worked it's like it's
almost like a five-minute video it says if I have a shit cuz they're ugly and
stupid and they make loads of mean things and we just watch them be like
oof we'll leave that alone not all of us are ugly but like you get that video
would be a better video than some of the videos we've responded to because to say
you know Wolf is stupid Rags is an asshole and Mola can't doesn't know how to
edit I'd be like yeah okay there's just straight-up insult but to be like Rags
his position is that everybody who disagrees with him is actually wrong
it's like that's that's not his position and then so if you get people convinced
of that it's gonna damage Rags his credibility or at least the perception of
his credibility so we like to address the the things that are like that I
consider these videos worse than a video that was just a collection of insults
because I just feel like whatever I can ignore that but if someone uses the
truth to paint a picture without all of the truth then it can damage my work so
I like to address it and that's the same I mean we're gonna be proving that it
goes for Wolf Rags and me today so yeah so let's yeah I think that about
explains why we do what we do don't let it just sit around you know oh yeah it
should be said that the guy who made the video has been friendly with me in DMs
friendly in the way that's like I am making this video it's happening even
out he asked that I would do a voice clip for it and it was to read the
opening of it which you're gonna see and I said that it's probably better if I
don't because it'll confuse people if I'm in the video so I just I said that
it's rather not but I've told him he's welcome to come on he seems interested
he's said publicly a couple times he's looking forward to a discussion about
all this with me I don't know how he's gonna feel after we've covered this but
the hope is he'll come on efap and then there's there's an additional thing with
Eric coming on efap that we'll get to in the video I won't talk about it yet
asking if I'm gonna make video I made one like four days ago well I mean I
said several times that it's gonna be a while before part two comes out and I
still get tweets saying you said part two would be a week later it was like
it's in the video I didn't say that yeah I say the beginning because it got
edited at the end like us that's how I put it but maybe I should just edit at
the beginning to not say it at all so I guess I guess we're pretty much good to
start let's see I think so let me let me grab a bottle of water and I'll be
right back that's all good yeah I guess what you could say I'll repeat this at
the end I guess the whole the whole argument about me wolf and rags will
claim that the criticisms invalid because it's taken us out of context the
meme vision is let's just say I say 1 plus 1 equals 3 then they go okay it
equals 2 you idiot and then I go we'll look at the larger context and the
larger context literally changes nothing and so I'm just avoiding criticism
that's what they think is happening but then what I'm arguing is happening is
the larger context is me talking about a universe where maths is different and I'm
referring to the in logic of the universe where it 1 plus 1 does equal
3 remember the same people that accuse us of not taking criticism well are the
people that disable the ratings on their videos and delete comments I mean it's
easier than that well there should be like these are the same people who we
could definitively prove take us out of context and that's what we're gonna be
doing in this stream as they sort of I'm hoping this stream will be referenced in
future whenever someone's like Mueller always says it but never proves it like
oh we're gonna be doing that today and it's gonna be fun on the bun I hope
people refer to this stream whenever someone says Eric taxons a great
youtuber I mean I haven't seen any videos from him other than your what is
one on you and it's one of me so yeah we've never seen any good videos from
him so also I lied I didn't get a bottle of water I got I got a beer I mean I
would drink but I gotta remain coherent otherwise this could get very very
confusing stay I can stay cool here so is everyone ready for this oh no the
films oh look at that we started 30 minutes in that's how usual that's what
used to be our intro amount of time it might be to pad the intro more we're
gonna so we need to have a two-hour intro come on guys people get mad if the
intros less than two hours right yes yeah you gonna say something am I gonna
say something what have I what have I not no what have I said no I said it
sounded like you're gonna say something and then wolf or Jay rudely cut you off
and I was curious I am I wanted to say that I'm ready for this
experience excellent I've got provisions I've got this drink and I got
another drink and I'm ready to go I woke up for this I got out of bed today for
this mm-hmm so really everything that happens after this is just a bonus all
right dedicated guys I would that's dedication to the to the craft real
bigger than rags intoxicated the chat asking from the last Jedi defender what
if what have I said you well you've you've provided defenses for the last
Jedi but as far as I'm aware you don't consider it a great movie or anything do
you I don't think it's good I think there are potential defenses of it you
could make that I've never seen anyone make this one day in a video can you
give us what just a teaser I'm curious oh I've no desire to go into this right
now just one okay so you've got the the throne room fight is a complete mass of
choreography okay but essentially the way when you watch the fight those the
like the mistakes in the choreography are things that you do have to notice
and it is completely a thing is it is completely like a potential possibility
that you do not notice those mistakes and for people who view the film in that
way the film is gonna be a lot better so essentially it's not it's not
necessarily ruining the scene it's still a bad still a flaw but there are ways
that you can watch the film it's not like you're watching the movie notice
but still the hyperdrive kamikaze Luke's change of character couldn't you
argue that all of these things are only a problem if you notice why they're a
problem yeah yeah I this is why I don't want to go into it now essentially not
fully I've not fully like realized this script yet well you know a quarter done
and I'm gonna try and make everything logically sound in a defense of the last
Jedi well then everyone will hate you remember we don't allow opinions on the
last Jedi that are positive in any way shape or form so just remember that sir
never to be invited by Connie fab after this Jenna said film is great if you
don't see the flaws since since 2019 that's true the emotion is the best
film of all time I like a quiet place when I don't think about any of it I
think Aquaman is the greatest film ever made if I just shoot myself in the head
I think they did it okay the way they did it you know I agree with that is uh is
everyone ready go good here we go
okay
one of those months on scripts thing remember the last time that happened we're
doing the thing where there's long text on screen and then we're all supposed to
listen to something so he's reading the the second half of it out I think oh no
sorry he's going from it may sound unbelievable oh okay
men's but your work is precisely what I would label the opposing issue barely
covering the subject with any depth or insight what so ever because you
explored what is essentially a thumbs up or down this is very yeah a little bit
so context is I'm talking to Eric I believe back and forth and Eric is
saying that I think he's throwing in criticisms for my work on Wolf's work
whatever and you know the whole I'm bloated I don't say anything of value
all that stuff so I'm like okay to reverse it to you I think that you take
so little time that you address a topic with essentially thumbs up or down my
evidence would be the wolf video he takes a very narrow selection of what
wolf says extrapolates it into wolf really doesn't know the difference
between something being forced in terms of diversity and just writing being bad
and I think he basically proves the point that when you have bad writing
that doesn't necessarily mean it's because of forced diversity which is a
point nobody had disagreed with as far as I was aware and so he what I'm
suggesting is he makes a point no one disagrees with over what was like 17
minutes or something like it is it's a very short video and it addresses very
little of what wolf said and so I just be like yeah your work lacks depth and
insight as far as I'm concerned and you seem to just say wolf's video thumbs
down I do want to point out that the picture of mauler in the background he
literally printed that off framed it and there's a picture of him on his
twitter holding the framed picture of mauler oh okay I don't know for the meme
I guess wait do you guys not have a framed picture of mauler in your frame
well here's the thing I don't have it framed I have it folded and tucked in
into my bookcase where I can grab it whenever I want to like ogle it and then
no one else waggle ogle ogle ogle ogle it defrosted robot mentioned the logic
for why taxon did not cover most of wolf's videos because wolf did not make
arguments and we're gonna prove that wrong today but we're gonna have to wait
till we get there I'm sure that Eric taxon is the authority when it comes to
what is and isn't an argument well yeah cuz I think Eric's response to what I
just said would be you're saying I didn't say much well wolf didn't say
much to begin with so that was what I was covering and so I'd be like okay so
now we need to prove the wolf did say something and we'll get to that but yeah
this comment from me I don't I'm not sure entirely what he's going for with
this intro but I would guess that he's trying to make me look very I guess
either arrogant or arrogant and vain the idea that I'm like I spend months on my
scripts making sure I do not repeat myself I remove redundancy as much as I
can it's no ramble and the editing process takes months along with it that
sounds a little bit up your own ass you know I mean but I'm like strange because
he's doing this while literally zooming into a frame of you over choir music
well so that when I say it maybe I could have phrased it to sound a little less
vain what's the problem with text yeah I know like like if you guys want me to
clarify that statement I'm trying to say that when you say I repeat myself or I'm
bloated I'm like oh well I specifically do multiple redrafts to avoid that so
I'd like references basically if you could do that for me if you don't want
to that's fine it's just that I can't do anything with your commentary if you fuck
all you say is it's bloated I'm like okay
I'll work on that a lot of people who don't watch your videos will take a look
at the two hour plus time stamp on them and they will assume well of course he's
being redundant and it takes him too long to get his points across well
interestingly worse it does the Jack's position and we'll see it in this video
and I think he reaffirms at the end is nobody can make videos as long as mine
and not ruin their own points and he will he says that uh mola might be the
first to do it one day but certainly hasn't so far like so there's at least
some form of consistency in that he thinks no one can do it he's not just
picking on me but you can't make something that long and make it coherent
I guess would would be what are you really is that is that what he said well
you know I'll I think that's what he said but we'll we'll let it play strange
thing to say there needs to be more depth with media exploration on YouTube
very coming from the guy that made a 53-minute video on molar about the um
there needs to be more depth on YouTube as well I've I believe I first say in my
Outlast series or the Soma one but I say like my channel was created because I
just don't like what was on YouTube for popular media analysis it bothered me
and so I created the videos I wanted to see and then it turned out there's a
handful of people who wanted to see it as well I don't know like I just you
know I've me and wolf separately disliked downward thrust for possibly
different reasons but like when I realized downward thrust was really
popular and I watched his videos and obviously the the podcast before
Colonial Marines like I think we went over what yeah that's how I was feeling
when I was watching his videos and I was just like it's I blowed away that this
is getting hundreds of thousands of views and you could be like well people
feel like that about you more and I'm like okay that's fine I just give me
some references and then we can see how valid the criticisms are versus you don't
like it which is also fine it's just there's a there's a difference and I was
happy to fill that space in the market from what I've heard many people love
long-form stuff as long as you have something new to say throughout mm-hmm
which I do my very best to make sure is the case it turns out rampart isn't with
the Empire and he's here to steal an Empire ship for a job he's apparently
got to do because he's an outlaw or whatever so he reports Ranger Solo
we met in civil war confronts one of the two men about this plan and it is said
that he must return to Wakanda
see the editing quality is about on pyrotheric text I was about to say this
is clearly an intro style choice I guess so there's not much we can glean
from this other than he's just this is an intro that he must return to Wakanda
sounds like things you've said it sort of is and they fucking cut to the next
scene they cut to the next fucking scene what the fuck okay that too should not
have been capitalized that's your opinion oh yeah we probably should have
said does anyone disagree with the title of the video long critique is not deep
critique I mean not necessarily I was gonna say in general typically is well
if you look at an IGN video and any other review I mean a three-minute
review of a 150 hour game as opposed to an hour review of a 150 hour game I'm
gonna trust the hour review more yeah it doesn't have to be but oftentimes
brevity won't allow you to be deep with something and and this is the other
problem is what is deep right what is deep you know someone's deep is another
person shallow and vice versa it's complicated I suppose for a placeholder
we probably like deep is just when you've explored something in the subtext
if we're talking with with film though instead of specifically talking about
what is seen and heard you start talking about what it means for the character or
what they they're feeling as a result of this or what it means on a thematic
level that's probably accepted as deep or is it could deep be a synonym of
extensive would you would you guys accept that I don't know extensive I
would say yeah not leaving too much out making sure everything goes covered
you know I differ from person to person how you want to really quantify it you
know when when did when do we cross over from you know shallow to deep but
generally since it just takes it takes time to get your ideas across because it
just takes time to speak yeah it's something really short and really deep
it's just tough it's not impossible yeah it depends on what you're doing so like
yeah in relation to the title long does not necessarily being deep but long
also does not necessarily not mean deep short does not necessarily mean deep
but it also doesn't necessarily not mean not deep it's this almost like shorten
deep and long yeah they're two different qualifiers I agree also there seems to
be a little confusion in the chat guys this is not Eric Eric is in this video
but what we're seeing on screen is not actually Eric yeah there's three Eric
sections I believe from what I remember but yeah let's continue long criticism
is not deep criticism now before we get going let's quickly go over what's not
being said by that statement that lengthy media criticism is bad or shallow
criticism that's not the argument being made here because that's not what I
think that's not why I believe there are many essayists eyes of the content
they're covering is fairly long Noah Caldwell Gervais is a video essayist who
produces lengthy videos often in excess of two hours long videos which explored
not only his initial reaction but elaborate on that why I'm not really in
disagreeing with any of this the problem is I haven't seen enough of Noah's
channel I've only seen the outlast video and one other one I haven't seen his
channel now from what I understand Noah's what we would refer to as much
more of a subjective critic he would he would much more focus on how he feels
and the things that made him feel that thing yeah bless you of course ranks I
don't make you if you'd reference tonaled here we'd be obviously being
like this is just not true but I don't know enough about Noah to disagree with
this so I'll just happily say it's fine no a great reviewer he's here with us
today exactly lengthy videos often in excess of two hours long videos which
explored not only his initial reaction to elaborate on their wider context on
what may have influenced the work or how the worst was his argument here is that
there are people who make long stuff that remain deep but um I I think
that I guess his overall point at the end from what I remember must be the not
to my length though because Noah still still sticks at like two to three hours
I think while I'm arguing for like a 15-hour film review you know that's
that's out of this realm work may have influenced others offering greater depth
in understanding aspects like imagery theming or style in a work and why they
may strike us a certain way in his newest video for instance he might
explain how for that 76 is artificiality may break immersion in one
respect but on a tactile level make it easier to stay focused on the gameplay
I don't know that anything you agree with regs I'm googling tactile just to be
certain that's an interesting tactile is an interesting way to say it I'm
trying to see if there's like a definition that I'm unaware of that
makes more sense but basically it has to do with like touch the sense of touch
maybe he's referring to like how the game feels more real more more like
it's strange use we're tacked out I just have to ask him what he means by
tactile but I don't think we're gonna get that yeah yeah I gotta listen to it
again 76 is artificiality may break immersion in one I don't know what he
means by the artificiality like I seriously don't know when he says the
artificiality of fall out 76 breaks immersion I don't know what that means I
would imagine he means the fact that you only interact with like robots and you
don't actually really interact with characters it's my guess I mean the
quality of being made or produced by human beings rather than occurring
naturally or I was gonna say doesn't this apply is I think he might be saying
that the artificially artificiality of the game itself cuz the all games come
with that right every game is working to immerse us into it yeah maybe he's
trying to say it doesn't have any heart in it like you you feel like you're
playing a product not like you're trying to play an experience of a sort I don't
know if he was here I would ask him what he means by him or him what do you
wouldn't mean by that but the artificiality of fallout 76 is
something that I it's a odd thing to say I don't do I hope I don't do that in my
reviews I hope I just tell you what I mean and I will it's okay I think to say
a word that some people could be like what exactly you mean by that and you
didn't realize you would have needed to explain it it's gonna happen I don't
consider that I would a strict floor of what he's just done it's just that I have
no idea what his point is yeah I don't know I don't know what he means by it the
video for instance he might explain how fallout 76 is artificiality may break
immersion in one respect but on a tactile level make it easier to stay
focused on the gameplay I don't I have no idea what that means breaking immersion
makes it easier to stay focused on the gameplay is it like the story boots you
out of your immersion but allows you to appreciate the gameplay on a tactile
level is that what he's saying the tact on a tactile level I don't like does he
mean the gameplay like the feedback you get from like accessing the game's
mechanics or using those also yeah I mean this wasn't intended but like this
would be something I would say that like he would have made this longer to
explain what he means and that I'm not saying this definitively but that is a
result so he's making it longer and it becomes deeper because it explores
exactly what he's actually saying and sends the message forward now you could
be like that's not what deep is maybe like oh no I I'm saying that you could
use deep in multiple ways and being longer here may have helped him express
his message and that's usually why my scripts get longer and longer is when I
realize I need to explain or qualify a lot of the things I say but not every
time not every time yeah but this is like this is total bloke you know a
little bit yeah yeah I would be like what what do you even mean by all of
that I fit I'm happy to believe that Jack actually thinks something here and
he could easily explain it to us he's just chosen here that he understands
well tonaled I don't think he remembers the video he made yesterday he's like oh
I used what weird sorry yes to Google it break immersion in one respect but on a
tactile level make it easier to stay focused on the gameplay he might explain
how mechanics and elements borrowed from the Elder Scrolls make the game an
arguably more enjoyable play experience but impact on the unique energy of a
fallout game and there's nothing like total tea pronounced arguably correctly
it's true sorry the unique energy of the game I would have yeah that I was
about to say that's that's something that I would mean what do you mean the
unique energy of the game these phrases like they say these there's it's like
tonal they say a thing and they try to they rely on the person listening to it
to just fill in what they personally mean instead of me trying to you know
what exactly is the person saying the words what did they mean what's the idea
that they're trying to get across I don't because it's just this is only a
minor part of his video so we can probably just move on because he's not
it's not he's reviewing fallout it's just that yeah I don't really get what
he's trying to say here someone in the chat said you know what else has unique
energy Chernobyl yeah it would that's true it is a true statement thus damage
it in other ways race evict does much the same providing a meticulous analysis of
games like Mass Effect and Max Payne with it goes up to an hour long from
it's like Lindsay Ellis and Dan Olson you know whenever I see Lindsay Ellis
referenced it'll always be alongside Dan Olson and then sometimes page bomber guy
those two get referenced together all the time interesting they're friends so
maybe that's part of it but um it's not like he's only referenced these two it's
just that the I I think I can't can't be sure but I think that Jack would agree
with them politically typically too and that's another indicator for why he
thinks they're better long-form analysts I think they talk about I'm pretty sure
Lindsay Alice has mentioned points on feminism more than once not to say that
he is biased but it's it's just a potential that's all with why he would
have chosen these people because there's so many long-form critics out
there and yet it happened to be these ones like it's interesting to me that's
all to larger more mainstream professional outlets such as no clip
there are also creators who produce longer work like I wonder if he knows
who Ahoy is because nobody knows what Ahoy is politic politics are yeah he's
excellent long-form creator but maybe maybe Jack would consider him bloated or
without meaning this is the thing from what you guys have seen like I know rags
this is you know why I can't remember if wolf has but Ahoy is quite objective
he'll only tell you what the things are and what they do so you could be boring
but I know you like this is boring it's not showing me what it means intrinsically
and I would just be like well that's for me I can decide what it means to me but
I'd like to know the information you know everyone everyone delivers different
things on YouTube right yeah to an hour long from independent creators like
Lindsay Ellis and Dan Olson to larger more mainstream professional outlets
such as no clip there are also creators who produce longer work which offers
insight into the behind-the-scenes process of a work information they
uncover which might not have been gleaned elsewhere Olson runs through the
whole ordeal of handling eel James writer of 50 shades in the process of
making its film adaptation and how that reflects on the finished product this
too deepens our understanding of a text and how he might think or feel a certain
way about it that doesn't explain anything about actually what he does I
mean I'm willing to accept those statements for what they are I suppose
it's just he talks about the author while assessing the movies and how
they've affected blah blah blah you know like what could give you more insight
into how a movie is made it's like go into production elements go into
interviews talk to the cast talk to the director figure out what the process
was who produced it all these little things may give you more and more pieces
to the puzzle and so if someone said you could get a deeper understanding as a
result of any of those things I'd be happy to be like sure that's fine with
me oh and there's there's a few people who said like the the don't assume
intentions so quickly the the political thing I think is relevant because Wolf
had more than a few snarky shots fired at him for his pilot the politics that
weren't even relevant to his video from Eric and so I think it's worth
highlighting that they think we're right wing possibly all right who knows what
do you say that you were in the he said you weren't centrist he said what did he
pin you as in he was calling me a centrist in a mocking manner but at the
end he very clearly insinuates that I'm far right okay so there you go and
because apparently when I said that Hollywood is full of left-wingers that
was something a right-winger would say but that's like an objective fact so
yeah I I don't even think that I know a lot of the times left-leaning people use
that as a point of pride yeah and I would say that I'm almost
certain that Eric and Jack are I don't know where I put them on the scale but
they're on the left absolutely but the thing is wolf so there's there's a
potential political divides that sometimes seeps into the commentary and
there's a few bits in this video that come up and I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with liking these creatives for their politics by the way
that's it's a complicated breakdown it's just something to do with them what how
they may perceive a difference I mean a lot of people perceive that my videos
people relate me to Ben Shapiro all the time because I I mentioned I like to
stick to facts when discussing facts and they're like that's what Ben Shapiro
says I'm like I think a lot of people have probably said that that's not
something this a bench appear patent but okay you've both said the same thing
once so you are now the same person that's how it works so yeah but we will
just move right along it's so when I say that length does not someone asked is
your wife a dr. mauler it's my wife baby Hitler I'm not following yes my
wife is a doctor that's a meme with Ben Shapiro because he always references his
wife because she's a doctor okay yes my wife's a doctor she helps me with my
objective medical criticism a certain way about it so when I say that length
does not create depth I'm not saying length eliminates depth it's depth
neutral simply a result of one's ability to focus their efforts cleanly
summarize relevant thoughts and information and some tertiary stuff like
just how quickly you speak your vocabulary and how many pauses you leave
in for instance this opening is probably about twice as long as it needed to be
to get my point across yeah my my brief review of this small selection is it
could have been redrafted to yeah it's not convincing it doesn't tell us really
anything about any of the people that you mentioned pretty much just says a
name briefly what they sort of do and what you're telling us that means it
hasn't convinced me of anything you could have done a lot shorter you could
have essentially said I'm not saying that all long critique is like lack
step he could have just said you know essentially that and then said there
are lots of readers I like that do long stuff that have depth and then
immediately moved on that's essentially all he said at this point yeah and I
think he wanted to provide some creators to be like see I do actually these
people exist and I do enjoy them therefore I do accept that those things
exist which is fine you know how pedantic do you want us to be if we're
gonna be dealing with it from him so it's like we can while he's criticizing
I say I'm referring to us and we it's obviously me rags and wolf rather than
Jay as well but I can't be asked to say we accept Jay every time okay so I'm
just gonna say we we are one of us come on he's criticizing content designed to
criticize movies while we're now able to criticize content that is created to
criticize criticism so this is a rabbit hole that goes on forever but there's no
reason why we can't but yeah all he needed to say if his point was that long
critique is not deep critique and long critique is not also not deep critique
as in it can be it but it doesn't mean it is it that's it yeah I don't think the
fall out and elder scrolls I can't even really call them examples unless I put
huge quotations around them I don't think they added anything to the idea he
was putting forth yeah nothing it doesn't add anything but I don't
necessarily disagree with the sentiment he's putting forth yeah I don't even
really get what he's trying to say with the fallout stuff that's the thing the
not yeah not the fallout stuff just the the overall point that you can make
something long and it can be deep it can also not be deep that's fine with me I
agree a lot of the time I'm basically repeating myself or making the same
essential point with different wording it did not make my video any deeper to
make it this long to which you might say well nobody's arguing that you may have
even paused your livestream to try and make that point to which I respond oh
well sorry I'm sorry but if you were more concise and clear we wouldn't have
to pause it and wonder what you mean well we didn't even do what he said did
any of us say that nobody was making that point I think all we said was we
agree with him right looking for clarification on a lot of things that he
said yeah me and I mean I guess he's just saying that he's a victim of the
same flaws that he's gonna be growing up our channel I guess all right yeah
that's fine with me I can I gathered that to try and make that point to which
I respond I'm sad to report that after coming through the work of one of YouTube's
most verbose popular media critics having spoken to him and his fans about
why he feels it necessary to create works double triple quadruple the length
of any other creator a practice that would for anyone else lead to repetitive
aimless content which obvious skates ones own points he's saying if you were
to do the practice that I'm doing then it will lead to aimless points and just
bad things in general not necessarily well he's he's saying no one's done it
yet that's what he says at the end I think which I find interesting I don't
know it's like can you cite any but because we have to cite someone out
outside of myself so cuz anyone made a 10-hour series or a 7-hour series didn't
someone make a 7-hour video on a Pokemon game that everyone said was really good
someone in chat's gonna know about it I'm just not sure I don't know
I'm waiting for it someone's gonna know you can do it come on chat we believe in
you total loca believes in your shame a
sham they go Shay may made a seven-hour analysis of Pokemon Omega Ruby I have
not seen the video but it's extremely well received I mean I'm pretty
and comment from the gaming Brit show interestingly is gonna have to flag
this video for murdering all other videos
that's pretty cool I don't know I haven't seen it um point being that other
people exist that are doing what I would say I'm doing you just gotta go find them
and as for none of them have been able to do it without being aimless I don't
know as a steep steep comment that's something not something you can ever
prove unless you watch literally every long proof that you've watched all of
them do how could you do that like like I found everyone's like what about this
one fuck and his fans about why he feels it necessary to create works oh yeah
mathematosis did a six and a half hour video on Dark Souls that was commentary
yeah I was about to bring that up yeah I wonder how he feels about Matt maybe he
thinks he's aimless too I don't know I mean I think you and I think you and Matt
are it's dense there's a lot of stuff in there there's a lot of stuff packed
in examples and justifications for statements and I really enjoy them
because of that I mean my channel is a reaction to doing the small videos like
I wouldn't be doing small videos because they exist already and you'd be like
what do you mean by small videos I'm like uh small videos they're both good
and bad still is some that I actually really like these large channels I
follow that makes more videos that I really like but then there's ones that
are really awful and people cite them as like the best analysis on the thing and
I'll be like they barely touched on it and the reverse criticism is more or
can't touch on it because of how much he bloats the script I'll be like okay so
then what happens like well now we got to get to proving one or two of this
statements to be correct and that's what we're here to do today double triple
quadruple the length of any other creator a practice that would for
anyone else lead to repetitive aimless content which obvious skates one's own
points the idea that his videos length inherently gives it depth is the only
conclusion I can possibly draw really that's the only conclusion you could
possibly draw oh very charitable but okay that's kind of an asshole thing to
say we'll let it go so this is on a level of video essay completely removed
from anyone else in the internet I absolutely love these videos and I love
how incredibly lengthy and detailed they are never children so yeah this guy
has said lengthy and detailed thus that is an important distinction yeah I did
that is videos length inherently gives it depth is that is that not so obvious
yeah it does kind of look like it but I think his channel is more like a close-up
of a head and has a bluish background it might be a new eye because I remember
reading them it looks similar but smaller scripts often surpass 50,000
words that's a novella at worst in a novel at best you can't get much more
in-depth than that you really can't the man is an absolute gentleman and he
holds his work to a standard that most people can only dream to it still ends
up having flaws it's still never perfect but nothing of human invention is
especially in idea spaces good objectivity musings sargs I mean that's
on the sargon video yeah so if if he was here assuming this is not so obvious
if he was here and then you said so not so obvious you think anything that's
long is automatically in-depth he'd probably say no
can you draw that from his statement here possibly you just have to get a
little bit the fact that that's the only conclusion he was capable of drawing
that's just fuck I just had the name of it in my head a argument from ignorance
fallacy it's just I'm too dumb to understand why people might like this
thing so therefore X yeah what's your take Jade you think it's a fair result
of this comment or do you think there's a I would say that you know there's
definitely more interpretations of this that are definitely you know not even
like difficult to come to just there are many ways you can separate that I
don't think this is gonna be gonna be honest if I read these comments I
wouldn't walk away and sage these people think just cuz it's long it's good yeah
and and if they did I'd be like oh that's not really my goal I didn't I
wasn't only intending to make a long video I'm intending other things and
long is a symptom of the goal or a result of the goal I guess people that's
like an odd thing for people to just go out and say just cuz it's long it's
good yeah I mean mauler if people were going around saying his content is long
and that means it's good that wouldn't be your fault well he's his point is
that all he can figure out for why people are enjoying it is that it's long
and therefore in depth or something like that well let's hear him out again
aimless content which obvious skates ones own points the idea that his videos
length inherently gives it depth it's the only conclusion I can possibly draw
yeah they go because boy oh boy it sure ain't the content well there you go it
can't be the contents it must be the fact that it's long it's oh my god it's
the bro no part yes boy oh boy it sure ain't the content
for the milk I was thinking it was for the ivory personally is this the second
intro a good point I guess so with the crappy transport lighting we'll see it's
a collection of mine what you would call my nitpicks the irony being that he's
picked one there that was specifically put into the script to talk about nitpicks
I say that in the video but uh good never mind Jack never mind sacrifice
reality I even criticized alien in the exact same way to prove that this isn't
about whether or not I love the film that I do it it's just wanting to talk
about a filming element that's it something like that she is requesting
death by decapitation with an axe why so I mean I can qualify these if you want
if I didn't in the videos which I'll put my hands up maybe I didn't but um I
always thought it was stupid as fuck that asthma orders executioner storm
troopers they like specific I don't know if you guys remember they've got like an
actual design on their helmet that and they have laser axes like an execution
wooden medieval times which to me I'm just like oh Ryan it's dumb because they
have like two blades on them which doesn't make sense unless you want two
parts of their neck maybe they just it would make autism comes from the neck
part of the spine maybe the Asperger's into them but you talk about so much in
these videos and these are just little segments where you talk about the big and
the small details and let's be clear here nitpicks are still valid criticism
yeah they may be small but they're still and if you call me saying they
have laser axes therefore the film is bad as a whole yeah I would say that's
stupid gonna go a lot long beyond just a laser axe it's gonna go long beyond one
flickering light those things I like they pretend that that's all we say well
Quinn did the exact same thing I'll ignore the other five hours and 57
minutes of well the content this is the interesting part is that at one point
this video they do reference in a very difficult way that I sometimes do make
points and I was just like man it would have been so awesome if they just shown
an example of something they thought that I made a good point on they show
the example of me saying um you know like the story of glorm and how Luke
jumps onto a son and kicks all that shit like Eric says that that's really funny
and that's the biggest compliment I think I get from this video and I was
like okay that's something but it would be cool if they were like he makes a
point about I don't know let's say that's ridiculous
hold those plan let's say they they actually agreed with my take on that and
they were like yeah he raises a lot of good contradictions there that could
affect someone's enjoyment I'd be like yay you know there's a severe lack of
benefit that's all that's all I'm saying available why what does this add for the
audience why is the Admiral wearing a ball gown it seems so inefficient and
disrespectful inefficient is referencing her ability to walk across the bridge
when things are happening right because it's action-packed and wearing a ball
gown you could trip over it that's all I'm suggesting with that and disrespectful
would be you're in what is essentially a military militia thing everyone's
wearing combat gear and you're in a like ball gown it's like okay are we all
allowed to wear casual clothing and it'll be brought up later I think but
Mon Mothma wears something similar in this return of the Jedi and the Mon
Mothra is a politician who is a part of the Senate and an ally to the rebels so
she's there to basically be their connection to the Senate and she's a
politician like I said she's not an admiral however if she was an admiral
and she was controlling everything I wouldn't therefore say it's not a problem
now because it's also in return of the Jedi be like no it's a problem in that
too so that's me explaining that the video would have been made longer if I
had explained it which would have then made it worse in Jack's eyes so I can't
really win at all here but I can try I suppose personally when I'm in the
military I want to be able to run around with my Crocs and socks wearing
my breaking Benjamin t-shirt so comfy it's strange because you know it's
completely out of character for Holdo because everything else she does makes
perfect sense yeah she's a military mind I'm all wearing a ball gown it seems so
inefficient and disrespectful mola is a trending critic in the YouTube sphere
molar this is accent mola wait till you hear him pronounce Wakanda oh yeah I'm
gonna make a guess I'm gonna guess it's what what kind of oh no I'm trying to
pronounce it like a babbling retard no it's I don't know how he came took
pronounce it the way that he does it's definitely tied to his accent but he
must have heard it pronounced in the film so we'll get through it is a
trending critic in the YouTube sphere notable primarily for the fact that his
videos analyzing various pieces of popular media often bloon up to four
capping off at nine hours long as I said earlier orders of magnitude longer than
almost any other online media critic to this and base sorry it skipped for me
let me draw it back as I said earlier yeah I agree hi I make long-form stuff
agreed orders of magnitude longer than almost any other online media critic to
this he has received an outburst of support and or from his growing fan base
admiring his dedication to his craft the fact I wish I could see what you see
we're watching movies I left the last jet I hate to get but I'll be able to put
it to his why I hate it I guess there's no point reading these
comments he's just saying that people like my videos so sure that he's
willing to go further than most in his discussions of media to stress this
praise for mauler usually centers around his exhaustive commentary and he has
inspired many of his fans to use this same format in their own video essays so
for the sake of clarification I encourage length usually because it can
very much lead to further detail and more clarity given between the choice I
would rather have something be too long than too short yeah if you told me to
watch an extremely amazing breakdown of let's say Star Wars episode 9 when it
comes out and you're presenting me like I there's two universes one way of the
video is five minutes and one with the video is two hours I'd be like I'll take
the two hour because I don't know what they're gonna say in five minutes that's
gonna be amazing for me about the last Jedi really tough for them to get all
the points across in an accurate way without being ambiguous or leaving us
kind of wondering what you mean it does take time to get details across that's
the thing it's just it literally just comes down to what you're looking for
when you're looking for a video what do you want to get out of your experience
watching it that's that's the only difference I agree with that his most
popular video series a five-hour long critique of Star Wars the Last Jedi has
between 800,000 and 1 million views depending on the section now for the
purposes of open and honest critique we'll be running through a broad
selection of his noted work which puts us an impasse rather convenient for the
man himself who has repeatedly made it clear that critiques which do not
specifically go through every single aspect of a work is an act of
dishonesty so that's our first major strawman yeah that's a that's a huge
problem because definitely not true that's absolutely never been stated nor
implied that I think that and now that's something that he's just declared as
true for his whole audience which is not cool yeah I mean your your buddy
here made a really fucking shitty video on Dishonored Wolf and one of the
reasons it was so awful is because there's a lot of relevant stuff that's
very meaningful to what you're trying to say that you cut out and didn't talk
about there is a lot of stuff that you cut off that is relevant specifically
relevant or it's stuff that completely contradicts the things that you are
saying when you make a 13 and a half video would only include about what was
it a minute and a half two minutes three was one wolf saying three out of his
wolf 17 I believe yeah you're leaving out a lot of important stuff and it would
sound like the argument yeah he leaves out the argument we're gonna go on that I
wonder if there is a reason why possibly so my position that I don't think I've
ever stated otherwise is that if you're gonna criticize a thing be it a movie or
a video something that has an actual start middle finish and then you're
gonna attack it for a position it takes and ignore any context within that thing
that would make your points invalid then that is dishonest so for example it's
yeah if you tackle one specific point I make about a movie for example I just
say hold those here is fucking yellow and then they go was purple there's no
context or well they may not I doubt there would be context that would
invalidate your argument against me in that case but if you say that like
Wolf's argument is what I presented here and then Wolf makes his argument later
and you don't present it that is absolutely dishonest and then on top of
that so that's a thing that happened and then on top of that you accuse our sort
of take on that as you have to cover every single detail in order to have
honest criticism that's not something I've ever said so yeah that's just not
true that's just not true I don't know where you got that idea maybe it's
cuz your buddy got really butt hurt that his video was shit and we told him it
was I don't know but yeah that's just that's not an honest thing that you said
that's the thing you can cut out whatever you want so long as it either
doesn't affect your point or you're honest about it well like if you he
accuses me of doing it in my TFA videos so I'll just give you an example the
smallest quote I have in the video from a creator is Hello Greedo saying that
debating art is stupid there is no context that changes what he said there
it's not a parody it's not a joke it's not anything you look at the original
video it stands as a statement so I've cut out his entire video where you could
you could argue there's more context but it's not context that changes the point
I'm arguing against so if that makes sense I hope it does so he's got a
little snide remark there us implying that we've dropped so he's created a
straw man for our position or my position at the very least and he's
saying that that position has now been dropped in our response to Joseph
Anderson I don't know what the implication here is my assumption would
be that he's saying we did not look at the body of work of Joseph Anderson to
be able to make conclusions on him through that video maybe we cover entire
video so I don't I was gonna say that we responded to the video specifically so
again I'm not 100% sure of what his point here is but it just the way he
delivers it sounds like he's trying to get a gotcha in here because he didn't
give anyone time to think about it someone said someone said it's funny how
we see a video from wolf and an Eric tax on video in an efap and an Eric tax on
video in the fap that's the infinite loop being for the man himself who has
repeatedly made it clear that critiques which do not specifically go through
every single aspect of a work is an act of dishonesty yeah that's just a fucking
line we will not be showing all five hours of his Star Wars review nor do
you have to depending on what you're talking about yeah just as we will not be
showing all nine hours of his docs I was too critique doesn't show any of my you
see this is a problem buddy is that we don't care if you don't show all of it
we care when you start misrepresenting it and lying about it and taking it out
of context which is the only thing you people are capable of doing because you
don't actually have an argument nor the entirety of his many hour-plus-long one
of criticisms Chris we will be as with most critics addressing the segments
relevant to this discussion while trying to remain clear and straightforward about
the piece as a whole but if you're of unique disposition that this is
impossible without exhaustively summarizing the entirety of what you are
critiquing we encourage you to so let's I'm a recycle do you want to watch that
again or I can read it out because I wrote this one down cuz it confused the
hell out of me yeah go ahead read it out yeah so sticking to what is relevant in
the current discussion while approaching the piece as a whole is only possible by
going through every single detail according to me that's what he just said
sticking to what's relevant in the current discussion while approaching the
piece as a whole because that's what he wants to do in this video and he's
saying that's useful for mauler because his position is you can't do that
without going through every single detail so we can already write this
video off and so it's just it's essentially the same straw man but I was
just like sticking to what is relevant in the current discussion while
approaching the piece as a whole I'm like yeah well if you're doing that just
don't ignore the portions that would stand in the way of your argument yeah
you can't cut out something that would make your argument weak or outright
contradicted and if you do that that is dishonest of you because you could cover
my entire video show all the clips and then actually still get criticism wrong
I wouldn't then be like well you showed all my clips therefore your criticism is
100% valid like this goes both ways because they do that one point they play
a clip from me and they misunderstand what I said oh boy so yeah I can't
imagine that they would do that no I know it's crazy so let's keep going to
head over to his channel and watch the over 24 hours of content we'll be
running through today but who is this we well I brought along a pal for this one
I'm gonna grab a drink and let Eric taxon take it from here and discuss the
last Jedi and maulers maybe you should pick people who are better at making
videos maybe he shouldn't be the one who's picking yeah maybe maybe you
should have got someone else cuz Eric's video was really fucking awful so for
the sake of clarity I'm gonna ask that none of us comment or pause until 853
okay and we need to get the whole thing on record show most of my video and
bases his argument off of something that's just not even there and just to
clarify for viewers how would you just say in the difference between Ripley and
Ray in terms of force diversity one has the force I mean hi I'm Eric taxon you
might know me from a little video that I put out back in October called what is
forced out of course it is honored wolf now since I released that video I've
gotten a lot of responses to it and basically I can conclude that it's
perfect it's bulletproof because no one can actually figure out how to respond
to it and they just end up making wolf's arguments again but slower and worse now
in that video I say that I don't give a shit about Star Wars because at that
point I had only seen episodes four and five and it was too far back to remember
this was on purpose I delayed watching any Star Wars media consciously because
I wanted to make it clear that it doesn't really matter whether wolf is
correct about the things he's criticizing because he's wrong no matter
what his is the premise of his argument is completely baseless and he never
defines forced diversity as anything more narrow than diversity present and
things he doesn't like apologies to everyone who wanted me to respond to
the entire video point-by-point you have to you have to make arguments for me to
do that but just just before you go right so that's the section on wolf and
that's what we're doing first before we move on obviously so we'll be going
back through it a few times but remember everyone he said that I don't make an
argument so like so just to be clear he's not playing a character in this
clip he's like actually this is actually no like I'm being serious like is this
actually what he thinks this is sincere yeah this isn't him doing like a bit
this isn't him playing a character this isn't him trying to like pretend to be
someone else so we can knock it down later this is actually what Aaron tax
and believes with sincerity well I don't know about Aaron tax and Eric
certainly is he is a yo-yo so Wow what a slimy fuck well let's let's let's go
further than that and talk about why so the first thing that happens is they
they play a clip from efap now watch the clip again I'll pause after it's done
and then any of you three can tell me what you think they were trying to do
with this clip discuss the last Jedi and maulers problem doesn't show most of my
video and bases his argument off of something that's just not even there and
just to clarify for viewers how would you just say in the difference between
Ripley and Ray in terms of force diversity one has the force I mean I'm
what do you think the intention yeah that was yeah it's to make it seem like
that was all we had to say on the matter so what we're gonna do folks is check
out that video itself hooray this is gonna be weird isn't it's a it's an efap
first where we're jumping between videos because our entire argument relies on
context and he's watching he's watching Eric watching me Eric don't make
close-ups of your face you're just you're so Titanically ugly I know this
this I know this doesn't have anything to do the argument that's what the rest
of the whole stream is for but holy fuck well we there's a section at the end
that wants us to address insults and I think we'll we'll have that section to
talk about ethics morality and basically how things work for that aspect because
it's tiring to hear that over and over again that you've said this word therefore
you're the worst and I'll be able to talk about my discussion with turbo
button which will make it even more interesting so this is a I'm just
getting the right time stamp 137 50 now you saw Eric's clip let's see what this
looks like when you play it in general that takes most of my points completely
out of context or otherwise just doesn't even provide context at all doesn't show
most of my video and bases his argument off of something that's just not even
there and just to clarify for viewers how would you just say in the difference
between Ripley and just to clarify this is going to 140 103 so no pausing up
comments until then so we get the full juicy context all right in terms of
force diversity one has the force I mean my take would be that a Ripley was a
character and she's played by a female actress obviously and then there are
elements to her that you could definitely there are choices she makes
an action she takes that could be informed by her being female rather than
male just like how that would be the same for a lot of the Marines you could
probably argue there's certain things they do that you could be like it's
because they're the man's man you're stuff like that but ultimately the
important parts of her character have nothing to do with with her agenda
they're all very much about what she is experienced who she is you know all the
stuff that everybody can relate to because it doesn't require that you have
particular genitals while Ray doesn't have anything in terms of character and
we know that one of their goals when hiring for The Force Awakens was that
they just I mean JJ's dream was having it so it was all Asian cast but
obviously you couldn't have that because reasons I don't fucking have no
idea how casting Wix and obviously when he said that it could have been a joke
I'm not saying that's definitive but they were definitely concerned with
getting away from the whole straight white male cast can't have that any boy
even though it's fucking aliens all over the place in Star Wars so you have Ray
is a female protagonist and then you have Finn is a black protagonist and you
have Poe is a is Poe Hispanic I mean Oscar Isaac he's something like that I
think I think I heard where he was from I can't quite remember anymore either way it's a
it's a very diverse cast and you know what it also is like it's completely
lacking consistency or development for their characters and it looks like they
were focusing on that element because that was their goal rather than focusing
on characters first and I imagine that's what Wolf was going for that's my take
it's very it's if you want to sum it up and Ripley a woman is what she is it's
not who she is she isn't defined by the fact that she is a woman unlike Ray
who's defined by virtually nothing she's got nothing else what else is there and
it sucks because I think the however I mean I hate to do this but you know
offense today's originally but like so many people pick up on her acting
ability like that's not something I'm just inventing a lot of people find it
very difficult to watch here because she has the same delivery for a lot of
things she says I'm not saying she can't act whatsoever I'm gonna go to that
extreme but was she chosen because she's female or was she chosen you know we'll
never know that definitively but the goal when they were making the film was
to have a diverse cast and since that wasn't gonna happen naturally quote-un
quote from just casting based on ability they had to make sure the quotas were
there like this character has to be female so that's the context well that
pretty much shits on Eric taxons argument so his he's gonna be saying
he's already says that the point has never been addressed has never been
developed and all people did was say what wolf had already said but slower
and more wrong so that's the argument Eric but sure take us out of context and
make it look like we have no idea what we're talking about we struggled to
I don't know come up with what we're talking about not cool but fine we'll
we'll move on from there to the next part which would be the fact that he's
obviously going for wolf specifically with I need to actually use the restroom
real quick I'll be right back yeah it's all good well so any thoughts so we can
delay a little bit until rads gives rads gets back yeah anti rads yeah guys if
you're a fan of Eric stop stop I mean again I'm seeing the rest of his channel
it could be good shit but we're not doing great so far that's all I mean
this is what he does because he made a video on TJ once I saw that and he
totally mischaracterized him too this is all he does he doesn't like people so he
mischaracterizes them because he's not intelligent enough to actually make an
act a valid argument I would say that I didn't agree with everything you said
when you're making those points but if I wanted to respond to them I would
actually address the points you were making rather than pretending you didn't
have any it's a this is the problem outside of the problem is that this is
a very complicated subject so what we're addressing is the the actual
relevance of the argument Eric's claiming it doesn't exist and then
portrays in a different way how bad or good the argument is would be a second
discussion I mean I would argue if I were to argue against this and I haven't
put a huge amount of thought into this because it's not an issue I really
invest much in but if I were to argue against what you're saying it would
probably say something in line along the lines of yeah you know they were going
for diversity but you don't know that that's the reason it's got any flaws in
its writing it could just be you know essentially a coincidence that they were
going for both and there's you can't really prove a cause and effect
relationship there is what I would say what would be a definitive proof for you
would it be the author saying I chose to have a diverse cast I was more focused
on that than writing whatever the character was I would say it would be I
mean first of all if you've got like a studio forcing stuff on a writer that
they clearly don't want it would be much easier to argue that that is taking away
from the writing but when it's like JJ wants the diverse cast I feel like you
it would be more difficult to argue that that's then ruining what he's all I'm
highlighting is do you accept it's theoretically possible to prove force
diversity I mean yeah I mean that's all that's all wolf is really riding on here
and Erica said it you can't I would say that if JJ wanted it I would not
consider that personally to be force diversity because the person who was
actually making the art well he literally said that he hired people
because of diversity not because of their acting talent yeah and it needed
to be a female lead people in the world like I'm writing stuff that's got you
know a female lead that's like a lot of well sure but when every single
character in the entire film is hired because of their diversity and not
because of their talent or because it was the specific vision that the person
had in mind that's not quite the same yeah I mean to me the forced it away
force diversity could result in good content that's not actually the argument
it's more to do with is it happening which is it's so unbelievably rare I
haven't got an example for you but a time where they have prioritized
diversity instead of allowing diversity to be the result of prioritizing talent
that would be the formula I don't see the diversity should be the result of
like who's most talented it but it should like when it can be if you don't
care about the race of a character if that's not relevant to a story or gender
of a character if that's not a relevant thing then just you know hire the best
people for the job but if you're right something where you know race or gender
is somehow relevant to the story I literally could not remember what point
I was making when I started probably the there are times where it would be a
valid thing to force a black person into a black role like you wouldn't hire a
white guy for blade that would make everyone insane there are enough like
you know talented actors of every you know race and gender or whatever that
you can the fact that you're looking for someone of a specific race or gender or
whatever that shouldn't result in someone less talented because you can
find someone talented from pretty much anywhere to play something and if you've
if you're saying that they hired Daisy Ridley and she's not talented I'm not
saying that's necessarily true I don't really have much I don't really think
much of it she doesn't show it here that's the point if you think that like
I'm not sure if you could argue that the reason that they picked her rather than
some more talented is because they were looking for someone female since there
are so many you know very clearly talented female actors oh you're saying
that if they were to force the main character to be female they still could
have ended up with a talented actress but they they didn't yeah that that
wouldn't be a counter exactly I would just I'd be like that's true Jay they
should have looked harder but they didn't are you saying that if they
didn't force you know her to be a female character if she was a great actress it
would still be forced diversity because they were like the main character has to
be female and you're like why she has to be female okay but it could result in
good work as in you hire an amazing actress and you give her amazing
character writing but as wolves laid out right when you describe Ray as a
character beyond the fact that she is a human being and she is female and she
has all of these amazing talents the characteristics are basically at null
but she celebrated for being an amazing female character and you're like why
does everyone keep saying an amazing female character and it's like oh wait
there's a lot I would like examples of that but you know no we don't need to do
that like as long as this as long as one person saying it which I'm sure you'd
agree has probably happened oh yeah I'm sure that lots of people have said lots
of fucking things right yeah sure I mean that that's not the best way to phrase
that argument because one person more than one person has said that the earth
is flat oh well it's yeah no it's of course I was just saying it would be in
response to that's all you just need to prove that one person has said it to be
responding to it yeah no this is a really interesting topic I think there's
loads to discuss but Eric has pretended the all wolf has said is that uh the
force awakens is poorly written and there's no connections to force of
diversity when you can tell that these arguments are very much related to the
ideas of diversity and this stuff to be explored here like there are ways to
possibly dismantle or counter the arguments but he's just pretended they
don't exist I would not be surprised if I found out like something like Bojack
Horseman had its cast chosen for their like you know their race and their gender
and that I would very much not be surprised because the philosophy of that
show did you see what rags posted it's a good show I do Ray strong female
character stronger than Luke strong as Jedi stronger than Kylo stronger than
any other people googling that could be why are they good for more games well
it's why you know he's right though again we're only arguing for existence
and that should that should be enough to probably convince you that it exists
right yeah I'm happy to agree that it exists and so the question becomes like
what in the hell are they basing her being strong female character on it's
like oh she's just female and also really strong in terms of the force for
no reason it's like oh what a terrible character you can't argue that she's not
strong and also female what oh I get it we're not saying that she's not strong I
think he was memeing oh are you memeing that entirely up to interpretation
here's the thing you have Disney you have ryan johnson you have JJ Abrams who
make it very clear and very explicit that diversity is an extremely important
thing to them and like more important on and on about it like they wear like
Kathleen Kennedy's and where is the cool the force is female it's the foundation
so now it's forced it was never there's never gonna be a result of the the story
being written with character first and you'd be like well how do you not have
it forced and so like you will we're against quotas I don't know if you are
so this could verge into politics now but the idea that um you create a story
and then you go through your selection of actors and you're like yeah I'm
hiring this guy's the best and it's like but he's gay and black why would you do
that I don't care that he's gay and black my literal my literally completely
uninformed in any way opinion is that a problem exists but quotas aren't the
good aren't a good solution to it based on literally nothing that's just the
conclusion I think it's no I agree it's a fair position to take it's a
complicated subject and I've heard arguments where they say forced diversity
slash quotas are bad but they're the best solution we have right now that's
something again that could be explored but that's a whole other things we're
gonna have to draw back the key thing is that generally quotas are an opposition
to most people say is meritocracy all the record we're against them both ways
and the example I gave before was a film about a sorority of women and the
director says to the writer you have to have a black man and a Hispanic man in
the cast so figure out a way that they're in the sorority and then they're
like well they can't be a sorority the best I can do is like a headmaster or
whatever the visits and like no they have to be in the sorority so the
writers like that doesn't doesn't make sense and they're just forced in and
then we watching this movie like why the hell is these two guys in this all
female that's weird and then you find out it's like well it's to be diverse
and I'd be like oh but that's not that's not the story like it's and you know
then you get into the whole relevance to history or realism to history and then
demographics or geographic locations what the demographics actually are in
real life and you're trying to stick to them this is going to be relevant in a
moment because obviously Eric's position we could we could watch it again but
I've got the quotes he said wolf's video doesn't define what false diversity is
beyond diversity is present in the things he doesn't like that's what Eric
thinks wolf's position is and he said oh you get your second point out of the
way and then oh the second one these are the two points the second one was they
were no arguments to respond to and I do want to mention because I seen that a
couple times in the chat the whole argument that good writing would destroy
our argument the problem is that we're not saying it is a rule that force
diversity never results in a good product I am perfectly willing to accept
that there may be something out there that did force diversity someone
actually mentioned the Shawshank Redemption Morgan Freeman's character in
the book is actually white so that is an example of force diversity that did
work but that's not the argument being made the argument being made is that it
almost never like ninety nine point nine percent of the time never results
in a quality product and we present wolf and we were trying to present the
symptoms of forcing diversity that are negative and that is they often forget
to make a fucking character because they've just said this is this is just
talking about like the principle of forcing something because of a person's
gender or their race or whatever it's yeah it's just a really stupid precedent
to set the Dark Tower for example the main character in the book is definitely
not black but they made him black in the movie and granted I even said in my
video on the Dark Tower that I thought that that was like the least of the
film's problems because that movie was so just wildly retarded in every way but
the act the problem is that we shouldn't be setting that precedent because it's
really stupid and just discourages good writing and most of the time it
results in like terrible things so just just as a rule we shouldn't do that
and I don't know if you guys feel we should play it again just to get Eric's
points out about wolf or we should just go to the source material for wolf
yeah we can go to the source material okey-dokey like I said the oh wow my
chat window just went black those scary the is it's back so it's fine so yeah
the points were there were no arguments presented animals position is that he
just doesn't like bad media and he's blaming diversity and the ones that have
diverse casts in them so in today's political what Eric did I believe was
play a selection from the like two or three minutes at the beginning ish and
then he played a clip near around likes I can't exactly remember the exact
things and then jumps around he leaves out the vast majority of the video is
what you really need to understand but let's let's all remember everyone Eric
said specifically I did not make an argument we already did actually holds
true nor did you define what force diversity is so and you if you want to
write down a notepad so you know because this is gonna be probably one of the
longest stretches of video watching we've ever had on this on this show but
there's gonna be another few of them later too we're going till 1056 from 709
you guys ready for this alrighty poor writing now a badly written enacted
character is one thing but does that necessarily mean that it's forced no not
always but the reason why Ray is forced is because she has nothing going for her
the fact that she's a female should not be nearly as relevant as it is but both
the force awakens and the last Jedi go to absurd lengths to make sure you know
she's a woman and because of that she can be strong all on her own being a
strong female character isn't a bad thing but when you're written to be a
strong female character then you're generally going to be the exact opposite
and that there is the crux of the issue having a strong female lead isn't a bad
thing the problem is that the writers are going specifically out of their way
to make some kind of specific character without taking into account what makes a
good character in the first place it's fine it's you mainly to listen to what
wolf said the visuals were yeah the visuals aren't exactly important but
they were halo guys it's okay it was just halo gameplay guys strong female
character that's just what she evolved into they focused on character first and
made the female aspect a natural characteristic of who she is is a person
Ray on the other hand was never written with any characteristic beyond being
strong actually thinking about it you might want to put that efap logo back out
because I think I got my video claimed for some of the footage I use hmm okay
makes sense all right the covers your eyes covers going on for reasons now
people so when you start saying more or take it off it's on for a reason male
characters written that way nowadays to the point that they act like total cunts
for no justifiable reason I genuinely believe that the reason for this is a
total misinterpretation of what they perceive to be a strong male equivalent
Marcus from Gears of War isn't exactly a nice guy but there's an actual reason
behind that there's history there's development before and after what I've
come to find from many female characters nowadays is that they try to replicate
the same thing that male characters do in many circumstances without actually
adding in the history and nuance required to understand why they're that
way in the first place if a character is a dick for no reason it doesn't matter
if they're male or female villain or protagonist no one is going to like them
so just shoehorning in some half-assed character written to be a man doesn't
tend to work out too well this goes for virtually all characters that are forced
in for no justifiable reason remember when Ubisoft decided to shove a
transgender character into Assassin's Creed you know the character that no one
cared about and had no reason to be in the game how about the transgender
character from Mass Effect Andromeda who's first line to introduce herself
is hi I used to be a guy but then I took scissors to my dick and made myself an
origami vagina please refer to me by my new name stupid cunt when writing a
character there's obvious things that you need to keep in mind about who he or
she is you can't just take Luke Skywalker and make him a totally
different irredeemable character that isn't even close to being the same
person he was in the original three move yeah I'm still salty about that
unfortunately a lot of people just don't seem to get this there are reasons why
characters are the way they are fantasy stories are typically dominated by white
people because the majority of fantasy stories are based around medieval Europe
which is predominantly white even more so back in those times sure you don't
have to base it off that but that's where most fantasy stories come from
inserting a bunch of black people in the Lord of the Rings would simply never
work because it's based around that area in time period but nowadays you're
shamed if your artistic direction isn't diverse enough the developer of the game
Kingdom Come Deliverance has been criticized for not putting enough black
people in the game even have the utterly brain-dead idiots from the guys at Fun
Hoss who tall this line but not you Lawrence you know what's up
despite this game trying to be historically accurate it's been
criticized to hell for something as arbitrary as not putting in enough black
characters as if that's something that's even remotely relevant on any level I'm
sorry maybe my whiteness is preventing me from seeing the bigger picture but
wouldn't you feel kind of shitty for being the guy that's put in the movie
just because they need a black guy when you prefer to have a character written
specifically for you that has legitimate depth and intrigue forcing this shit
because you feel some kind of ethical obligation to include everyone you
possibly can find doesn't add to your story it breaks it I don't care if you
have a black guy in your game or movie but give him an actual reason to be
there beyond well we need a black guy sure put in some gay characters I'm all
for it but make that a natural part of who they are don't focus solely on the I
like to take it up the ass part look wonderful place to stop also Jack is
apparently in chat be nice as best you can the last thing we need is everybody
in the chat ripping into him be nice make your own videos Jack drop the spare
and so yeah there's a reason why I like Wolf's channel and it's because he's
pretty efficient with like how many points he makes in the amount of time he
has and obviously his delivery is pretty passionate so that's fun to listen to his
entertainment and the fact that I actually think that this is a strong
video would probably tell you that I do actually like some videos that are short
because this is one focused topic and he talks about it for 20 minutes maybe
some people would feel that that's too long or whatever I don't really care it's
like yeah four minutes went by those four minutes and there was 15 points so
that's pretty good I think or at least depending on the quality of the points
right so I'm just gonna run through them so a badly written character does not
mean a forced character Ray being female is pushed on the audience for no
narrative reason she it's it's it's what she is and that's it there's
nothing that distinguishes her outside of her being female and strong female
characters are good however if a strong female character is the goal from the
beginning likely gonna fail because you're misunderstanding what makes a
strong female character it's not the fact that they're female so this is
because writers are putting the cart before the horse that that would be the
an analogy for that I suppose Ripley being female was additional to who she
is as a character it wasn't the focus it wasn't they went we need a female lead
in alien she was a character that worked whether or not she was female it wasn't
wasn't the it wasn't the diverse if you call that diverse it wasn't the diverse
part of her that was intrinsic to her there was those things about her that
are completely relatable to any human being on this planet you don't have to
be female the aspect is it's important to to know that a lot of it has to do
with the intention behind it not necessarily just because someone's a
woman just because someone's trying to cast somebody as a woman please keep in
mind it is very important why the why is very important and here's the thing with
force diversity it's usually telegraphed to us because the people that force it
in are like proud of the fact they put that they forced it in yeah like Disney
JJ Abrams and Ryan Johnson as Wolf has already clarified force diversity isn't
definitively bad there is theoretically and we've gotten the one example we've
just mentioned where it could it could work to create something good or it
wouldn't get in the way of something being good we're talking about
qualification of it and be a negative tendency so and I was gonna say to
clarify again if you have a character that deals with female issues
specifically because that's obviously possible that doesn't definitively make
them a force diverse bad character you still make that work as in a character
that's I don't know it's a movie about a woman exploring what it means to be
pregnant and have a child like the other kind of things that it'd be assuming
medical medical science hasn't gotten to this point I don't know if men can do
that yet so yeah so that that's up to Ripley's female was additional to who
she is so that the problem would be explained by writers misunderstanding
what a strong character is they'll often have like a female female
characters perform similar things that male characters are celebrated for like
their payoff moments or the biggest action-packed things and then they fail
to realize like the reason that the payoff works so well is because of all
the writing that came before and led there so they just do that thing and
they're like see we've got strong female characters too and it's like oh no no
you you haven't got a character and so the reason they were there in the first
place was it was just it would be bad if they were male too but we're
highlighting that in this case they were there because of this force diversity
aspect and then wolf gave examples of Assassin's Creed and Andromeda was it
yeah Assassin's Creed Andromeda and Kingdom Come Deliverance although there
wasn't any force diversity in there it was people complaining about yeah they
were complaining that there wasn't in Kingdom Come Deliverance and remember
audience and I apparently Eric is in the chat using a different account I
don't know if that's true but Eric if you are in the chat and you are listening
to this I want to just point out in your video where you showed about a couple
minutes of my 18 minute video none of the past three almost four minutes of
this video of my video where my argument is actually made you happen to just not
include it and then you said I didn't make an argument almost like you're
just disingenuous and you're a liar so then white people are typically dominant
in representation for certain time periods and geographic locations due to
representing realistic demographics in those regions and you'll get shit this is
this is a quote from wolf you'll get shamed for that attitude and then he
provides example of Kingdom Come then he said isn't it insulting to be inserted
because you're black rather than suiting a character of death beyond the
surface to top it off he says I'm all for diversity and make it a part of the
character not them as a whole he's in favor of representation but don't force
it tying right back into the title of the video again 14 points in was that
four minutes or I think I said 15 in four minutes so to answer Eric
specifically with the source being wolf's video forcing diversity would be
defined as creating a character that is only discernible by their gender race or
sexuality and this is referenceable from the perspective of the audience and by
the character themselves within the universe and that would just be bonus
points if you've got production evidence where they've said yes we did this
specifically because we have to get Asians in there we have to get women in
there it's the most like it's cringe as fuck but again we've already said it
doesn't definitively lead to a drop but it can and when it does we'll have the
smoking gun if you will so the argument is hinged on examples in in this section
as well as all the explanations and examples of what she conveniently just
never showed yeah so like yeah Eric didn't use anything from this portion
and so that's what we were addressing in the fap and then a lot of people were
talking to Eric on Twitter I suppose without I don't know I'm trying to
assume the best here so I'm just gonna say that they all fucked up and they all
didn't provide Eric this this time stamp so this is it this is the section where
I'd say the that answers the two concerns that you have and the fact that
they're not in your video makes your video incompetence it's not just I'm
not going with the incompetence thing because I do not believe that I believe
it was only malicious yeah Eric taxon seems like a right proper cunt apparently
he just deleted the tweets really well can't stand by what you say mate which
tweets the tweets he made about not I guess he didn't you tell me that he made
tweets asking like for the arguments and people will if someone says he just
deleted the tweets I could refer to anything right well I'm pretty sure that
would be referring specifically to that since sure yeah either way I'm not like
I want to get through the entire thing before providing like commentary I just
want everyone to see what's happening here and how annoying it is for us and
so that's like more than four very significant errors that are made in a
manner that would imply that they're deliberately avoiding context and if you
think that's an unfair assessment I don't know I mean I really think I mean
if the shots right and he really did just delete all those tweets that really
says a lot about Eric as a person I think that's just a detail tacked on to
this nonsense I mean and first off here's the thing when when somebody walks
into a video and they say outright you know I couldn't be wrong he said his
video was perfect I don't think I've ever said one of my videos is perfect I
strive to improve on my stuff and I'm especially in the video I'm making now
I'm pretty clear that you can try to change my mind on things good luck on
some of them because they are the results of a long time and a lot of
thought a lot of thought and a lot of you know processing but when someone
enters into a conversation with the attitude of there's just no way I could
be wrong I'm perfect my point is perfect it's it's impenetrable then I mean I
think he said it tongue-in-cheek a little bit but it's still it's it's still
publicly presented that he thinks there's no counter argument and that he
did not take wolf out of context yeah I mean we were really thorough going
through Eric's video I mean it took us what two hours I think it might have been
longer than that I can't remember I mean we were really thorough if you didn't
pick up anything from that after even taking wolves video out of context and
just dishonestly not including the exact examples of things that would prove you
wrong in an instant I don't know man that's a pretty slimy scummy thing to do
but whatever makes you feel like you make good content Oh interesting Jack
four hours actually Jack tweeted seven minutes ago we still don't know why
forced diversity is bad beyond the fact that bad writing is bad they're not
listening at this point so yeah you're not listening I'm sorry I don't know
what to say other than you're just although if we give them a little bit of
leeway we don't know how long they've actually been listening to this stream
maybe so I mean if they only just came in they've been responding live on
Twitter I guess oh then they really said maulers fans genuinely don't understand
time up using long and complicated words like tactile it's not long and
complicated Jack we want to know what you mean by tactile yes how do you use
it in relationship to what you're referring to not a good look dude like
on this Twitter how about you stop being a coward and actually well come to us
the problem is that a lot of people gonna say like have him on and it's like
well we'll have him on after we're done here that's fine true what more can we
say I mean you will of course but it's like like stop taking us out of context
you disingenuous little shits how I don't have any like hold on hold on I have no
tolerance for lying misrepresenting and taking people out of context you are a
scum fuck if you do that and I don't respect you I don't think anyone should
respect you if you do that you took them all you're out of context you took me
out of context people have taken rags out of context numerous times in the
past I mean I'm just done with this shit I think you're a fucking scum shit if
you do this so one of the tweets he's got is I wonder if they noticed that we
were mocking the fact that wolf was unable to say for himself why it's a
problem that Ray was forced diversity and then played a clip of the mauler it
way away then they played a clip of mauler and rags arguing it for him so
Jack like I'll make this really simple for you because this is clearly hard we
were playing a clip for context of the clip that you provided of efap to
correct the context of the efap clip and then as we've just done played wolf's
argument in full the false diversity and then explained it to you we can't do
anything else at this point if you don't understand wolf talk we let him
talk for three minutes two minute that was wolf that was not me and rags after
that we corrected context on one clip and then another one hold on I think he
might be mentioning the the clip that they used specifically the one where you
know rags joked she has the force the one that we went back and yeah we
watched but the first thing is the implication of the clip which is that we
didn't know what to say yes that's clearly exactly what you're trying to do
don't play stupid yeah but here's the thing I do not I know for a fact and you
can look at any live stream I've ever been in I do not talk very well on the
fly like I need to really sit down and like think through everything I want to
talk about on a topic and really have time to write it out I'm terrible
talking live I like doing live streams but I know for a fact that I'm bad
talking live unless I'm like really fired up about something which is very
very rare like that that's the in a lot of people like that that's a separate
skill that has nothing to do with your the ideas that you have it's how do you
form those ideas in a way that you can communicate those other people and like
a separate skill in and of itself that's it thing people haven't and even just
aside from that I mean I stumble over my words a lot I have like a I don't it's
not a stutter I think it's called a stammer like every now and again I'll
like just trip over my words and people have seen it and pretty much every stream
I've ever been in it's just because I don't talk well live they weren't making
my arguments for me because I literally didn't know what I was talking about
it's because I know this is a very simplistic concept that you just
couldn't understand I don't talk well live so they were helping because it's
the three of us this is how the show goes yeah and a lot of people are like
that that's a very big yeah very big me and rags have a lot of experience with
live in the moment public speaking and debate so we're relatively better at it
but the thing is wolf had all of his arguments available they were all right
there and you already made they had already been made so yes it's fine if
you want to disagree but actually disagree with the things being said is I
think the long and short of it right absolutely and I mean I think it's fair
to say wolf got very passionately into that for a moment there because this is
going beyond you know like they make a diatribe about how it's very cruel to
use a childish playground insults right we may get into that when they bring it
up but um I don't know where your morality skews but I think it's much
worse to character assassinate somebody than to say they're stupid or ugly or
annoying absolutely there there are some things that are just insulting and
aren't very substantive for instance Erin's ugly ass Eric's ugly ass face
however there are things that are very substantive like you're slimy and
disingenuous and you're dishonest and you're lying because you're trying to
push your point or a narrative instead of relying on what the truth is and what
the facts actually are like those are different I it is I don't care if someone
calls me you know a faggot I don't care if somebody calls me or we call
ourselves that yeah all the time it I I would much rather people call me those
things than call me something that has to do with my character like a liar you
know something like that because that speaks to who you are as a person and
the behaviors that you actually do and also I'm not 12 and he said tactile
means some how something feels to play how something feels to play I still want
what the fuck does that mean Jack yeah you're still you're still gonna have to
clarify tactile doesn't tactile means feel in a physical sense like on your
actual fingers it's a feeling and he's and he's actually said as well for
anyone wondering why we're not bringing him on he's actually said himself he's
not gonna want to do a four-on-one so yeah it doesn't matter both parties are
not willing as it stands we will sort something out in the future more than
likely but we've got so much more to get through anyway so also it's not an
comment the interesting fact of America's most common fears the first one
is public speaking what was your point sorry I could never do public yeah
public speaking is the most common fear in America it's not even really that I
would fear it it's just that I don't think I could actually do it yeah that's
definitely a part of it I mean I can't even go like a normal conversation with
my friends at work without stumbling over myself it's like I don't have that
ability no it is it is a skill oratory in skill and being able to you know be
eloquent on the flying get your points across without having any time to think
about them that is a difficult thing to do that yeah if I can do if imagine if I
wrote the way I spoke hundred trillion ums between every other word or so yeah
and that's why I have to write things out when I make a script I need to
script everything out otherwise I can't do things on the fly not very well at
least and I guess to be clear about the tactile thing because there's some
people talking about it in chat when you say that a game has tactile qualities or
you relate to a video game like tactile means how it like feels on your fingers
it relates to the not like a feeling like like a vibe or a sensation I mean
actual you know we can say like you know say black ops 4 feels better than
fallout 76 because of the controls I think that might be what he's getting it
maybe but feel feel is such a it's a very very ambiguous I mean honestly I
don't even really remember what the point was that he was trying to make
well that's the thing because I don't know what he was trying to say I that's
what I'm saying it's a strange word that could mean multiple things it could
be interpreted in multiple ways also I'm just want to say Jack said that's the
conversation was agreed upon was Jack and Eric verse me and wolf and the says
there that rag said he didn't want to that's not true at all so if he's saying
I said that I didn't if I've ever said that that's never something I meant to
say but if he's saying rags I said it I can know I can tell you for a fact
rags has never said that yeah I definitely never said that you're happy
to come on but I'm not gonna leave we're not going to kick off a member of the
show because it makes you feel uncomfortable
grow some balls come on especially for you especially not for you guys of all
people we will address that when they address us with it which I think is in
the last few minutes but we'll we'll definitely get there so now we're gonna
we've responded to all of this action we're about to cover which gonna watch
it again just so you guys get how bullshit it is take it from here and
discuss the last Jedi and maulers problem doesn't show most of my video and
basis is argument off of something that's just should we skip this part and
just already pretty much ran over all this because we can skip the a little
bit about wolf skip and but slower and worse now in that video I say that I
don't give a shit about Star Wars because at that point I had only seen
those four and five and it was too far back well so what I will I'll throw
Erica bone here so if someone says movies with characters who eat apples
are always bad you just be and then my evidence is this movie where their
character eats an apple is bad the the example is in that sense yeah the
example would be irrelevant the argument would be something you can address
whether or not the example is true Molly gotta take down the logo already have
got a call sorry I'm sorry folks back up let's go remember this was on purpose I
delayed watching any Star Wars media consciously because I wanted to make it
clear that it doesn't really matter whether wolf is correct about the things
he's criticizing oh so the important reason why wolf has examples is just
proofs that it's happened in real life the results have been seen and I think
the most like potent one would be the the kingdom come deliverance one and you
know it doesn't matter if I don't have examples that the earth is flat because
Eric is wrong it's flat I know because I said so I would say that if he was this
is gonna sound really dumb as soon as I start saying it but if he was right he
would be right as an if he was right about his overall point he would be
right that the examples don't make it better yeah when you make a general
point the fact that you've got examples doesn't mean your general point is true
I feel that's what he believes but like that's what he's trying to say here to
again hopefully throw an additional bone like if Eric is listening to this what I
think that you think you've done is listen to wolf fully and decided he
never made an argument even if the argument is presented and it's bad you've
decided that if the argument is presented as bad it's not worth
responding to and thus you haven't shown it but anyone can do that to anyone and
then claim they're not taking out a context as in you know Jay makes a huge
argument for exactly why Thanos did what he does in Infinity War and then I just
read my response to him is showing his opening where he says I'm gonna make a
lot of arguments for thousand I go he doesn't really make any good arguments
it's all pretty bad to be perfectly honest with you and that's it and it's
it's unfair is at the very least you you should be able to sort of agree please
that it's just unfair to not present the bad argument if you think it's a
bad argument you can tell me it's a bad argument I mean you're wrong but you can
say that it's when you say that I don't have an argument when I factually
demonstrably do that we have an issue yeah hopefully that makes more sense a
lot of people in the chat seem concerned about me apparently I sound like I'm
dying you do sound a little ill okay I am ill I was hoping people wouldn't
notice but apparently they have I've just taken painkillers so hopefully it
will get better soon people are also saying that now that Eric's on screen they
want you to bring the logo back up because he's he's wrong no matter what
his is the premise of his art he's wrong no matter what well he's decided the
force diversity isn't a thing the wolf can't even be right that's what I said
earlier if you walk in saying that the other person is wrong no matter what
intrinsically like what why even like honestly why even have a discussion with
you I guess maybe for the benefit of the people watching and it's like it would
pretty much be it because I don't think Eric or Jack would agree with this but I
imagine you guys would like principles of argumentation if someone says to you
I'm gonna present my arguments for why all white people need to be killed as a
white person I would be against that but I would be like let's hear the argument
oh I would love to hear the argument but I wouldn't then say you're wrong
from the get-go therefore you don't have an argument because that's not true yeah
you can have an argument and it could be a bad one you could still have an
argument if I were to give him the benefit of the doubt here I would say
that what he is trying to say is that examples don't matter if for a gen like
for generalization if if I wanted to say you know oh yeah we've already we've
even then if it's one general if there's one tendency against another then a lot
of it will come down to how prevalent are the example yeah because the amount
of examples make it a you know make it general they make it the tendency it's
good to have examples but you don't have to wait like debunk every individual
example to make a point about to disagree with a general point I'm just
highlighted I forgot to put since in this channel description I'm sorting
that out you guys talk about something so yeah no it's good that's the end of
the road no matter what no we're good oh shut up we're gonna have this debate
about what I'm just gonna deny that made any
arguments at the end of it and then claim I'm right and that will be how the
debate will go and I will win based on my superior logic and facts beautiful
and your rhino milk and my rhino milk all right then he never defines forced
diversity as anything more narrow than diversity present in things he doesn't
like how do you know what I like and do not like I was gonna say do you actually
I'm trying to think of how you could counter that statement with just one
reference so the Shawshank Redemption yeah there's diversity in that film and
wolf likes it so that's how I love I mean it's one of the best films ever
made so it is the Shawshank Redemption oh yeah absolutely I was gonna say
Freeman if we're doing black in the book but he is in the movie and I love
Morgan Freeman and I love that movie benefit of the doubt he doesn't know
that you like that and that would be considered for diversity but that does
break no I'm not gonna give him benefit of the doubt because he's making I'm not
gonna give him that because he's making an assumption based on something that he
doesn't understand and he doesn't know anything about that yeah you wouldn't
say goes both ways he's made a definitive statement where he should he
doesn't have enough information to do so that's just a disingenuous claim such
as wolf doesn't like Beatles the cat and then I go wolf hates all cats Beatles
but it was fucking no tickles it's like it's Georgie Georgie yeah safe George
hashtag safe Georgie because I ain't surprised that you of course you have a
cat I have a cat yeah of course you have a cat I don't consider cats horribly
worthless I just preferred I do what no you're objectively wrong I had a cat for
19 years and she was my favorite pet ever I currently have a cat I like
enough you will never you were never be right I love that cat yeah I remember
all the time I go around and I see all the seeing eye cats and bomb sniffing
cats and paramedic cats and yeah I never said they were particularly useful and
they were useful I just said they're nice pets the only animal that can do
that doesn't mean that literally yeah what about rhinos rags they can't do
that and they still provide delicious right you can ride rhinos and first off
you can milk rhinos we've established this second off you can't come milk a
dog rhinos they just send rhinos and technically you can ride you can ride
rhinos into battle I saw it in the Black Panther movie that is wakanada is a
place in Africa right it's real it's all real isn't he a Jedi wakanada mm-hmm
probably I don't know sorry Eric we'll come we're coming back to you sorry
onto the entire video point-by-point you have to you have to make arguments
yeah I zoomed into my face that means I'm right it's funny it's H bomber guy
does this a lot I think Jay you probably use this style a little bit right oh yeah
I totally do that but when I do it I think oh my god I'm telling the truth
someone in the chat said holy shit is this Chris Chan's brother so mean to
Chris Chan and Eric I'm not no I'm not mean to Chris Chan I'm okay with well
I'm not exactly okay with Chris Chan Chris it is more of an insult to Chris
Chan to Christians contribution to Shrek retold was inhumane was the yeah that
was the best part of the whole I laughed my ass off when I came on I had no idea
what was happening well it's Chris Chan you never know exactly what's happening
that's true but hey now that I've made my eyes I can watch every single Star
Wars movie which I did I watched every mainline Star Wars film episodes one
through eight and I actually like them a lot I'm sorry I dissed them in the video
they're actually pretty good so the best one wonder if he means all of them are
pretty good by that or not because even I like said they're all I'm suggesting is
it's you're welcome to like sequels you welcome to like OT welcome to like
prequels I find it rare that someone would like all of them because they're
so different you know there are plenty of people who like all of them like I
said rare I'm not saying it's impossible it most people have an opinion on which
would be the best set and which would be the worst set you know I mean yeah I
mean there are people who just like pretty much anything like my dad with
movies he likes basically just every movie he goes to a movie he's probably
that's fair enough I'm good I guess yeah all I'm asking is Eric did you like all
of them because I think he puts Phantom Menaces I'm curious if you like that
one the second best was episode three revenge oh sorry I skipped ahead or at
least it jumped for me yeah sorry I dissed them in the video they're actually
wait he's not allowed to like last Jedi that's a no-no yeah your arguments are
invalid because you like last Jedi Eric that's something that we do and say here
yeah apparently one was the last Jedi obviously but the second best was so
happy three revenge of the Sith I like that one a lot and then the entire
original trilogy comes next like I had very similar feelings for all three of
them but return of the Jedi was my favorite it's closely followed by a new
hope and then Empire Strikes Back didn't like it's interesting isn't it
this one comes last I'd like to talk to Eric about this lineup like how he look
I am almost positive that he did that just to spite everyone that says that
the Empire Strikes Back is the best one yeah because I can't I cannot know what
now I will say return of the Jedi for me is my favorite in the whole saga above
Empire but Empire is an objectively better made movie I don't care if it's
I don't believe in that yeah that's bullshit so I don't really care about
the placement itself but the fact that he put the last Jedi and revenge of the
Sith two of the most hated films well revenge of the Sith in in retrospect not
what's strange is that he has eight at the top and then we have to go that far
to get to seven oh he justifies why that is yeah I think he's about to
explain it followed by a new hope and then Empire Strikes Back didn't like
the force awakens all that much that one that one comes last and then the
remaining two prequels are below that so two is the worst and yeah I'm just
curious if he still likes to like you had good ideas but just critical
critical pacing issues just made them a slog to get through so I can speak I
like that pacing is his biggest problem not everything else well I like the
idea the biggest problem is the pacing yet he loves the last Jedi yeah I was
about to say like interesting it's fine to like the last Jedi but it
definitely doesn't have the best pacing well now you have to talk about what is
pacing how do we objectively decide what is good pacing is a bad pacing as a
whole and again he doesn't subscribe to that well you know I'm not gonna make
entirely objective arguments here but I would say it would be very easy to
argue that if you have something that feels very climactic and then you have
falling action and then rising action again that's definitely strange pacing
at the least and I would sure but if I'm Eric and I can say you think that's
strange pacing I think it's perfect pacing I mean maybe that would be his
response I am just I mean it's fine if he thinks that that if that pacing work
well we know how good Eric is at identifying arguments so just to make it
perfectly clear myself and Eric agree to be on for a discussion with wolf and
mauler thereby making it an even discussion that is not the nature of this
show all I will say in response to that is how would you what would your
response be to me and rags or rags and wolf with you too is it the same or do
you have something against rags that's the important part they do have something
against right of course I'm leading those questions because Eric has
literally deliberately said in the past that he doesn't like rags he also
included you in that but I got I got booted out of that unfortunately this is
no there's no we're not going to concede that this the nature of the show is it's
the three of us and then a guest or two we're not going to kick off one of our
I suppose unless they provide very very rational reason for why rags can't be
here which I think is going to be impossible considering the playground
insults does not trump out of context mischaracterizations so even if I
consider that a leg to stand on it's already been lost by doing something
worse to us back so you can't come up with a reasonable reason for why rags
shouldn't be here and then my olive branch will be that you can choose who
you would prefer to remain as silent as they can as in like you say we want to
be addressing you know mauler only wolf only you're not going to choose rags but
if you did rags only the others we'd prefer they stay out of the conversation
unless absolutely relevant I will give you that even then I don't like that I
don't like I will even and I don't know if wolf and rags will agree with this
but I would even extend to you that I would not use a singular swear word or
insult if you would desperately demanding it not that I would definitely
use swearing yeah I can go without insults to what I'm trying to say is we
will accommodate you to an extent but we're not you don't control this
yourselves I mean honestly I'm maybe you two should man up I know that's a
little difficult since neither of you seem to know what gender you are but
maybe stop being cowards and trying to kick off a member of the show just come
on since you've both made videos utterly misrepresenting us taking us out of
context and deliberately lying about us stick by what you say don't try to pussy
out of it because you don't want to stand by your own words get Jared yeah
we'll get Jared Jared could be the other media's every 10 seconds you'll be like
anyways guys I like the idea that you bring him on for the debate and he
literally controls everything everything he says to be done like he's he's in
charge of it I want to see what would happen I want Jared to debate them one
or two maybe Jared would assassinate them they will get Jared to mediate the
the arrival debate but what does the film mean guys you talk about that so I
can speak as someone who only recently wonder if James Ralph is pointed with
these works by the way what is it with people who make responses to us and the
guests they bring along is the worst part of it I don't know I gotta be
honest with you I prefer Eric's parts to even though I think that they're both
erroneous this is totally subjective I feel like Eric is more genuine than Jack
we do have 43 minutes to go yeah well yeah I'll give my take on that at the
end I still this key you just call me naive I'm fine with it I still think
that there's good people inside them and they actually they did try they've just
monumentally failed like I know Eric doesn't recognize how shitty he is so I
think you're right there also someone in chat said that way don't it has it
interesting that you say claim playground insults and then you say the
cowards and make fun of the gender playground insults was referring to us
but we will get to the morality of that if you really are curious on why it's
okay to use playground insults I don't believe I'm saying I'm perfectly fine
with making fun of their gender or black this is so very interesting your
critic this guy in chat says you're criticizing both of them they're
criticizing both of you rags is irrelevant and you're using you you guys
are using me as a shield to avoid discussing with them we've literally
offered them to be on the show I don't know I think this is just like look
really just exemplifies the low intelligence of both these people and
their idiot audiences rags could be literally muted for the I'm not saying
he should be I wouldn't be okay with it what I'm saying is in the scenario in
which rags was here but muted that would be more acceptable because I don't like
it it doesn't sit well with me that he's being forced out for no reason that I
don't like it if you want me to argue like from a I don't know he's my friend
like it he's a member of the podcast there's no reason why I should do that
it is absolutely asinine to expect that we are going to kick off one of the
hosts of the podcast because you don't want him to be there and you don't have
any valid reason for it beyond I mean did he have mentioned him in this video
I haven't seen the whole video well well they've already they've already used me
as a way to dishonestly imply that we can't articulate the reasons why we say
the things we do all that rags is you sure cuz wolf can't articulate see guys
I'm enjoying being I'm enjoying being here it's great right but I feel like
you guys are all too talking a lot too much it's making me really uncomfortable
so can you I prefer it if I was just on the stream by myself you can debate
Jay I'll debate myself all along sins wasn't a guest he's actually the owner
he's a majority stakeholder in the efap company jay is technically our he's our
business manager he gets us really yeah the three of us are
diversity hires that's true yes mass people are underrepresented I used to
have a gas mask avatar when I was 12 when I was one
got you because I ironically my gas mask avatar was in a fedora anyway I made
loads of mistakes way before that I'm not gonna imagine I'm just gonna say
that makes sense that's all I'm saying I was four years old I yell dick across the
street without knowing what it meant someone said where is wolf well listen
wolf couldn't be here today because we needed someone from the intellectual
gaming community to represent can't own old look captain toned look beautiful so
I can speak as someone who only recently became acquainted with these works that
the Star Wars films are actually good they are hashtag Eric tax unapproved
however that to me there was another motive to me finally watching these
films see our old pal mauler has a five hour long critique of the last Jedi on
his channel and and I wanted to give him a fair shake so you didn't watch the
whole thing so there you go mauler someone actually watched one of your
critiques I don't I don't believe that at all I don't I don't I don't believe
that he's done it later I'm happy to believe that he has he still makes the
same mistakes that he makes with wolf but I'm mistakes in quotation marks I'm
being as best nice as I can look said we might call you naive you welcome to
honestly hell I'll call myself naive it's just so that we it's it's so that
it's said it's not like they can prove that they haven't been malicious and we
can't prove that we kind of can I don't at face value I don't trust Eric he
has this feel familiar guys do you remember anyone else who did shit like
this a certain individual situation but yeah so it's a joke it's fine the the
the part where he says hey mauler someone actually watched your video but
you didn't expect that to happen but um I have to highlight a bit of a funny he's
almost like accidentally implied that I wouldn't expect my critics to watch the
video and he's saying I actually did and I'm like Eric that's like the base
requirement so it's funny Eric I agree like it's a nice little delivery there
but it undercuts itself when you really think about what you've just said individual
situation people think I'm talking about Quinn but you are aren't you I thought
you were no Brett keen we've never covered Brett keen oh I thought that was
what you were referencing no no I'm referencing how we've seen this before on
efap well we've also seen this on DP the whole like I only want to talk to the
amazing atheist yeah the argument that we'll gang up on them or whatever it's
just I don't know come on guys really like it's something that I kind of you
could say is admirable about certain people like there's let's say it was
Eric Jack H bomber guy Shawn and seven other people Lindsay Alice and Dan
Olsen all of them in a chat and then they said okay mauler mister you can
objectively judge a movie come into this chat I'd be like sure I just don't know
how much I'd be able to get in with that many people there I mean I would give it
a shot so yeah come on we have a precedent of letting people on who we've
disagreed with and they've been outnumbered yeah check out the TRO
video I guess check out the since since video and check out the person in the
call with us right now yeah I mean he's a majority shareholder in efap industries
now so look at that you guys do gag up on your guests I'm just gonna go for a
minute I will be right back okay so if if by gang up on your guests you mean
we've provided points all backed up a fellow point it's just like sure but my
definition of gang up is a little bit more specific and harsher than that I
mean like the fact that having three people here is automatically a gang up
if if there's less than three on the other side like I don't know what to
tell you at that point that's just not how I would define it myself anyway
let's carry on hopefully he's able to hear it see our old pal mauler someone in
the chest pointed out at least just right had the guts to take on both you
and me like on the fly like we didn't even expect that he was going to watch
that stream absolutely and he would be in rags but he said about you and
fallout 76 I don't know what he said about me in fallout 76 I mean I mean can
we imagine how bad I don't know I mean I think I think my video is pretty good
for a first time first one of its kind so it's doing pretty good too yes doing
pretty good hello another motive to me finally watching these films see our old
pal mauler has said I like our long six you said what sorry who said I liked
fallout 76 what that's an that is a hard towered that is an odd takeaway for
somebody to think that I liked fallout 76 I would yeah I personally wouldn't
assume that from your video personal eyes tell me sweet little eyes I can't
get over that video I love that oh he was joking okay okay at this point we
have to make sure yeah yeah make sure it's kind of gone beyond the pale with
this week we don't know what's a joke and what seriously we actually do yeah
see our old pal mauler has a five-hour long critique of the last Jedi on his
channel and and I wanted to give him a fair shake so I watched the whole thing
so there you go mauler someone actually watched one of your critiques all the
way through someone seems like a couple like a million or so people might have
done that now they just clicked on and off
audience retention how many people finished it that's just audience lies you
mean YouTube analytics are just lies jays you know that lies and slander I'll
admit it I'll admit it I was all 1 million views all right so assuming that
people went from first to second to third they didn't just skip to the third
that means 980 people watch them well that's so that's how many that's the
third word three has he was making a funny he's like haha no watch it I mean
he's not gonna empathize with somebody who enjoys it that's very clear so from
his perspective why would anyone watch it and then he's like why is there a
million views on it no this makes sense and then they're like aha it's because
maul is tricking people into thinking he's an in-depth critic which is the
point of this video maul are you buying views are you sub botting literally
buying the bots from rags and the views from jay so why are you guys are you
paying people to write nice comments on your videos no that's just that's me it
is through accounts yeah he pays me to make like 15 new accounts a day it was
every video all right it was concise media will give you a little rundown of
the plot of the film they're talking about before they start really delving
into the into the minutia larger picture like Dan Olson on folding ideas has a
wonderful video called the art of storytelling and the book of Henry just
had a curiosity who is Dan Olson I saw he made a video I would actually
recommend everyone watch on Suicide Squad he explains all of the reasons why
Suicide Squad is really poorly edited it's really a strong video he's not a
fan of me because he saw my videos on h bomber guy who he's a friend of and he
got very flustered when I said that fun is subjective and that you shouldn't be
arguing that it's something that is absolutely gained in certain scenarios
for gameplay so like my argument being h bomber guy was like if you make dark
souls less challenging by changing this thing it'll be less fun as a result and
I was like that's not necessarily and so he was he put out a tweet saying
something like fucking out this guy is telling me that fun is subjective it's
like well yeah and there were a couple of other problems he seemed to have with
it but he didn't watch much of part one from what I remember of his tweets and
he just he's not a fan I still think he makes some good videos from what I've
seen and I'm totally okay with him I don't think he's gonna interact with me
anytime I don't know why he was just mentioned like three times in this video so far
yeah I get it anyway
Nusha of the larger picture like Dan Olson oh yeah and people are gonna be
commenting about his politics he's probably got politics that people don't
folding ideas has a wonderful video called the art of storytelling and the
book of Henry where he spends like 10 minutes of a 40 minute video just giving
a play-by-play of the plot maulers video also has this it's just it lasts four
hours and I'd like to say that's 20 yeah but 10 minutes summary out of a 40
minute video this 25% that's a fourth of the video is talking about what happens
just a plot summary that's a lot so like this is gonna be a recurring theme
of their criticisms that I do too much plot summary I don't know when to
address it as a whole I think we'll let them make the criticism a few more times
just so it sets in as to what exactly they're saying cuz I've I've spoken to
Jay about it yesterday I think but calling what I do plot summary to me
feels a little bit just just like over simplistic a little bit yeah like I
wish I was given a bit more benefit of not the doubt benefit of the text I
don't know just just look at what I do when I'm doing a plot summary and if all
you can draw from it is something that you feel you could get from Wikipedia I
I guess that's fine as interpretation but I'll explain the purpose of it when
we get some more of the criticisms for anyone curious as to what he has to say
you can skip like halfway into part three of the analysis and you'll miss
nothing like really I wow so like the one of the parts I'm really proud of is
the end of part one breaking down what they did to Luke and he's suggesting you
skip over it as much as I understand that he is saying skip the plot summary
and go to the summary which is a lot of people might want to do that with my
videos that's fine I would personally say even if you want to do that it's
worth checking out the Luke bit and then if you know if you hate the way it's
written Eric and you think you should be skipped anyway that's fine I'm just
saying that there's so much in there there's a lot there was so much in there
it's like the majority of the five hours and if you go to one hour eight minutes
of part three you find the part where me and mauler became friends a beautiful
time capsule as far as I'm concerned and I've not seen the critique in a
while so it could be wrong on this but if you want proof for everything you're
saying which the first four hours and if you just want the conclusions watch the
rest as yes my take the the summary I'll be saying things that on their own would
require proof but they assume that you've seen the previous four hours so
I mean he's right insofar as if you literally just want to know what you
think then you'll get a lot of it from just the last part I mean I've watched
the videos multiple times because I know in a single viewing I can't glean
everything that there there's just so much there's so much that's being talked
about so many things that are discussed and compared with one another so many
justifications for the scenes the idea that if you just skip to forfeits of the
way through and you won't miss anything that's just of course disagree with that
like what in what universe the analysis and you'll miss nothing like he's
spending that entire first four hours just giving a excruciatingly slow how
about all the points where he like said this is what they could have done to
make this scene better yeah like this is insanely disingenuous I don't even
have I don't have to play to counter his point because I just don't think his
point holds any weight at all I mean I know what to say it's that Eric is
terrible person that my objective way is for four hours you just described
literally just what happens in the movie there's nothing else there's no
thoughts there's no ideas there's no criticisms lib facts the only highlighted
because he's seen this video he was like it's weird that he says you've
essentially summarized the two and a half hour movie in four hours he was
like how does he think that you do that without people noticing like you must
have put something else in there right like how would people fall for that an
extended vision of what you saw in the film like that would be ridiculous so I
have to have something in there surely be the one I would reference for anybody
curious right so the the Luke part at the end of part one at the beginning of
part one near the beginning I present my take on what could happen if you had
talking talking to Poe instead of Hux and how you might deal with it from a
dialogue perspective is a part where I talk about what it means to subvert and
how you could do it well or not I think I use the departed as a counter example
the problem with Snoke I think I do have a whole section on that beyond
what's happening in the film what do you what it means for the rest series like
there's a lot of little little pieces of mini analysis and I think Eric's missed
them like what I mean like in chat said the Tarkin speech thing the Tarkin
thing like how do you I was like there's so many what do you even say to that
yeah so you know there's not much to do the other than just say okay that's his
take I guess okay I hope you like like being a compulsive liar I this is I
think this is lying this the idea that you can listen to four hours of
something and just say it's just a summary of a movie I go to assume that
the way you would cover his ass on this is the that was his take on it something
of course he would he will do anything to weasel out of any situation he's
called out on because he is that disingenuous I hope that all of his
fans like really close attention to their response to this is oh so we've
taken you out of context have we typical Mueller and I'm like okay but when I
provide this moment from the video that you said is only X thing and I'm showing
its Y thing does this matter to you and they're like no and I'm like why am I
speaking to you what's the point if there's no discussion okay yeah of the
analysis if that's in the related videos on that screenshot interesting parts of
of your video I think might be my favorite part is how you talk about the
what they could have done with Poe's character in the canto bite scene with
good and evil and him developing and learning about the morality and how it
might be complicated and all that stuff I thought it was really really well done
really liked it and I think that to just glean all over that stuff and say that
it's essentially to say that doesn't that didn't even exist is I mean I see
me seriously if you look at oh yeah Finn I'm sorry sir but if you look at them
because it was at the beginning of part two it was at the beginning of one of
them I forget it's all it's all kind of a blur because they're all so long but
I mean the good way though no it's fine they're designed to be rewatched
hopefully like in a year's time you go hey I might watch it again because
there's it's supposed to be dense with content and I know that you'd be like
wow that's vain mauler but I'm like oh well I was trying to design it that way
I'm not saying it's absolutely true I mean you did what a lot of other
reviewers like wouldn't be able to do which is go in depth and even give
examples of what could be done to improve the movie not just say this is
what's wrong and then leaving it that well like what wolf said if you if you
are like an Eric taxon fan like if I was a fan of Eric and I watched this and I
had watched your video what do you even think of him at that point like what at
what point do the gear start turning about the kind of person that he is
that's up for everybody to interpret it to each his own to teach his own that you
can mull about at your leisure just to those speaking out loud tire first four
hours just giving a excruciatingly slow play-by-play of the movie but here's the
thing mauler makes objective critique some of them and what this means is that
every every qualitative judgment that he makes on the film is based off of what
is provable which might seem fine but what this result I'd like that it just
might seem fine it's like it is fine Eric yeah that would be fine but he has
his opinions in there and yeah there is so you can see the way we'd we'd heading
it's like we're starting in the same position and then they veer off
immediately so they're like mauler does a objective critiques like careful is
objective criticisms in the critique and I usually try and make an objective
conclusion based on the objective criticisms while simultaneously letting
the audience know how I felt about the content and that is the critiques that
is not the rages which is another problem this video has to but we will
get there screw sheeting we slow play-by-play of the movie but here's the
thing mauler makes objective critiques and what this means is that every every
qualitative judgment that he makes on the film is based off of what is provable
which might seem fine but what this results in is it just the entire critique
is just a endless string of observations that I thought it was just a plot
summary it's basically so it's interesting they said that they're an
endless string of observations that you can just see let's say for example the
disappearing knife did everyone see the disappearing knife when they first run
through no I know I know I mean my first run through I thought that the that
scene was the one of the only few parts of the movie that were good and then it
was like oh yeah I was gonna say the proof of this is you go to my TLJ rage
and I say the scene is awesome then you go to my TLJ critique and I say okay
it's okay there's lots of problems if you ask me now like it's a fucking mess
yeah it's pretty terrible now choreography errors everywhere and you'd
be like well so it's based on how much you notice I'm like that's true and the
thing is when someone watches observations they notice X amount the
next person notices X the next person notices X and Eric if you notice every
single thing that I present in the video like you'd already know it that's
fantastic but there's a lot of people who don't yeah and the difference between
those is doesn't matter how much you personally notice it doesn't change
what's actually there like there there is a there's an amount of frames in the
film right those don't change based on what you do or don't notice they're
always gonna be there and we can look at those and we can analyze those
this fascination with first viewing is strange to me but like it it's I don't
know if these said it's intrinsically bad to do a plot summary yet but uh I'm
saying that there is value to presenting observations even if there are things
that you just know already because that's all I'm doing anyway it's doing
things that anyone else could do I'm not a god I'm demigod close but
you know unfortunately everyone knows that Simpsons is Yahweh mm-hmm sorry
you're Yahweh right I'm sure what you were born again weren't you oh no no no
yes once just are you are you trying to tell me that are you trying to tell me
that I've been following a false god my whole life oh we did it we did it Jack
on Twitter said at the current rate moles response covered by 53 minute
video is going to be over just over 12 and a half hours long I wish I was
kidding well done you've good job you've pointed out what he fap is
congratulations Jack a show that's called every frame of pause will be long
good job you're a bright one excellent so smart Jack you got it we've been
dismantled we've complete dismiss that almost like like heals the heartbreak I
know feel knowing that since it wasn't actually God how how the opposite ends
look at it though because we're like okay so we need to be very explicit we
need to have references you just show you where they've been stumbled I'm
gonna use that word where they've stumbled and how they've stumbled and
then their reaction is you're taking too long but they're right it would
definitely be better if you just said no this is wrong and then moved on yes
that would be objectively better it would be shorter so it would be shorter
I'm glad they go on with our lives people clapping mention that you've had
this long before you I will agree with them on that actually you know what I'm
saying and putting out there if app is objectively long long is not relative
okay we all agree unless we're talking about I think longs relative shit
argument because we agree on everything exactly no we don't actually cats but
yeah go ahead Eric take the stage but what this results in is it just the
entire critique is just a endless string of observations that like you can just
see it's basically just watching the movie again but slower and with a guy
yammering in your ear about how much he hates it a mass is displayed to them on
some kind of 360 video call which isn't explained in any way but why bother at
this point also interestingly with that point I actually kind of I would
criticize it myself I'll be like I didn't necessarily explain why I made
that statement because I thought it was obvious but that's my bad so what I'm
referring to is Maz is in the middle of like a civil war is what she says or
or something some it's not the Civil War Union disagreement I think she says
and she's actively getting shot at and yet she has a camera that allows her to
be displayed in 360 while she's like jumping and jet-packing around and I was
like yeah the hologram just happens to change angles and she ran the moments
which no other hologram has ever done in the history of Star Wars and she has
this setup the moment that they call her like it's just like okay that's a thing
now and again how did how was Poe the one that called her when he wasn't the
one that met her horse awakens and how did she even get there because the last
time we saw her was in that castle thing destroyed we have to do a lot of
assumptions like she must have another home and the Union dispute might be over
the fact that the place got destroyed and her workers are not happy and she
got she has this cool thing ready whenever someone calls her I guess and
you're just like all right then see I understood that's what you're going for
but have you considered that this is a nitpick which means your entire critique
is oh yeah well this is the irony right so I'm making a small nitpick there is
technically what I'm doing I'm mainly just asking a question of like how the
hell does any of that work but fine we'll move on you're saying it's
essentially it's strange it's an odd thing to and so like Quentin they've
taken this and have been like look what molar does and I'm like you're nitpicking
me that's not all that I do this is and just like how I nitpick the film it's
not all the film offers but I do cover what the film fucking offers I don't
know I do that we're not gonna say their whole video is really bad because they
just said this one thing it's just a pile of piling up yeah there's some
things I said we've agreed with already yeah I mean I mean a very simplistic
statements but still yeah I mean do you want every do you want every statement
in a critique to be about an extremely important like there are people out
there who don't think that the who don't think that you know why the death star
why the first-order death stars don't just light speed ahead of the raddest
there are people who don't think that's a big deal when the basically the whole
plot of the movie revolves around that I think that's a colossal failure of the
story and some people don't think it matters at all so even if you have them
even if you were to have mauler only talk about the big things what the big
things are is I mean that's just gonna be its own issue yeah it's gonna be a
nitpick some people like Billy the fridge he didn't think that was he they
literally said oh you're just nitpicking your ticket too seriously I
like that Billy the fridge jab you made in your video by the way he calls
himself it's not so much a jab he does call himself Billy the fridge I know it's
just funny like I said I'm giving Eric a point for how I did not explain what I
was trying to talk about there but negative point for implying that you
know there's just not much else in the video which is already done but hey
whatever it gets worse all which isn't explained in any way but why bother at
this point also see 3PO no longer has a red arm there is no reason for this we
seen all three parts so he's seen the part where I amend that and I don't know
he might have just gotten a clip from people exam I I don't trust Eric at
basically anything he says at this point I really don't like anyone in chat
remember where I amended that because it was a mistake yes you did that's indeed
you did yeah I think you start off with part 3 saying that yeah literally I'm
like oh I've made a couple mistakes and a few things I forgot to mention yeah
yeah let's go back with some edits and things people pointed out so there you
go so oh yeah and for anybody who's may not remember it's not a problem that
see 3PO has a golden arm back because he gets it back in the force awakens right
at the end and it's easy to miss because he's just in a crowd of people or at
least I missed it that's that's my point and so when people highlighted to me
that I'm making I'm raising something that's not even an issue I was like oh
shit you're right that's I fucked up and so this is people are like mold doesn't
take criticism I use that as a citation then they're like no you accept small
errors sure you don't accept that you make videos that are way too long they're
bloated and they counter the main points you're actually making and I'm like you
have to prove those things beyond that that's how you feel about my videos and
that's what this video is supposed to be and this is partially you know reason
for why we're responding this this is supposed to stand now as my response to
an in-depth vision of that claim I guess it turns out Jack and Erica willing
to go on the stream with you guys he's not going because he said that rack
being disrespectful I give as I get was that I'm sorry but that's it was in the
stream and stream chat somebody mentioned that but you don't get to say
the things you say and then bitch out because the other person is being
disrespectful yeah you don't get to say that we're being disrespectful when
I'm sorry yeah like I can't take that seriously after the what we've seen so
far and what's to come you've kind of you've thrown that away you've you've
lost that you you don't you can't be afforded that charity guys we've been
like discussing Eric for quite a while now don't forget that Jack does the same
thing oh he's coming back and he said I felt like he did worse than Eric in this
video so yeah just so all the Jack and Eric fans that happen to be watching
this either live or on the recorded one on the mooler channel don't forget that
both of these people are making these really disingenuous claims and I want
you to really pay attention to these people and if you're a fan of them I
think you should really evaluate reevaluate why you're a fan and if you
should even stay subscribed because this is this is ridiculous I wanted to
mention by the way that um even you know shinobi even he when yes he was
going to address wolf's more offensive comments in his Forza all-in-kingdom
review shinobi actually put a disclaimer saying that between the time of editing
his video and releasing it wolf had released a video explaining that he
feels slightly different on potential past things that he'd said in videos
shinobi put that in the video as if to say like wolf has actually commented on
this from here on I want that to be known shinobi had more integrity than
these two shinobi went ballistic after that stream but even then at least he
had apparently a more integrity than these two so let's let's push on mr.
it's just a endless string of observations that like you can just see it's basically just
watching the movie again but slower and with a guy yammering in your ear about how much he hates
it maz is displayed to them on some kind of 360 video call which isn't explained in any way but
why bother at this point also c3po no longer has a red arm there is no reason for this
the acts of watching all three of these parts all the way through actually sorry i forgot as
well um i actually move on to why i think that's an issue um because you could be like why is it
changing color an issue and i said that it uh it can represent the merchandise issue yeah uh yeah
it'll give a tell for why they would have done in the first place if there's absolutely no plot
reason for it which is in another you know like forced diversity forced merchandising would be
another thing yeah and as we know if uh a movie tries to sell merchandise it's objectively bad
mauler if that if you read all of the comics then you'll know why it happens which means it's good
that's true uh for anybody who didn't know for anybody who criticized the last jedi unfairly
you can get the dlc in a lego game and you can get a c3po novel that explains the red arm
okay just stop complaining who is a uniquely unpleasant experience uh he speaks so much and
yet run away georgie we need to get away from pennywise he's he's he said he speaks so much
and says so little i was like oh man let's just hang on to that point and like the tragic thing
is that he does have points in amongst all of the observations like he does have actual
grievances with with the film it's just like it's so padded out that that i appreciate
the fact that he managed to say that he at least was able to say there are points made jeez
round of applause thank you for at least saying that that must have been so difficult to do
well just not that you were not that you were even right or correct but that you just made
points chat i want to see you all type g for georgie we need g for georgie we need to respect
that this cat is a true survivor he's like a navy seal of felines g for georgie everyone
with with the film it's just like it's so padded out that that it becomes meaningless i don't think
so i think it's full of content we'll see that so if uh if this wasn't about me i and let's say i
was eric's best friend and he asked me to look at the scripts i'd be like eric what do you mean by
meaningless though like are you saying that you find it meaningless or that nobody should be
finding meaning in it and like and he's like i just want to say there's i find it meaningless i'm like
okay there's not much the guy's gonna do with that though because like if you just say that
it's meaningless you know there's nothing he's just gonna be like okay yeah it's like feel you
know it's it's one of those words that could be very like what do you mean it's what do you mean
it's meaningless i feel like this is one of those videos it's great if you go into it not knowing
the situation or if you already agree with yeah this is like the tro video it's so good for people
who already hate us it's like yes beat the shit out of them do it yeah he said yeah that it becomes
meaningless georgie run while you have the chance what you're doing so georgie's the mvp of this
video by the way i prefer georgie's arguments and i think georgie's structure is much more um i
literally prefer georgie's arguments basically what's happened here is that mauler uh doesn't
know how to edit his shit and now he thinks oh my god you do not ever get to say that someone
doesn't know how to edit yeah after you make a close up of the cat jumping down off the little
table thing there i just don't oh i wasn't even talking about that i was talking about his video
on where it went into a fifth dimension with like six different things playing over top of it with
like neon lights yeah but wolf you're addressing it objectively not thinking about the theme
that was applicable to that moment the theme of having an epileptic seizure got it i'm glad that's
interesting you uh but yeah the i don't know i'm still learning as an editor i don't think i'm a
great editor uh but my goal as an editor is to have a visual that's relevant to what i'm saying
i don't nail that at all times but uh yeah like that's what i tried to do with my fallout video
and i hadn't really done i mean it's kind of the first of his kind for me but i did try to do that
and it takes time i don't know if it takes time to work maybe he's referring more so to the
script i don't know why i wouldn't have just said writer in that case but um yeah uh i tell people
this it doesn't matter because the the people who think this way are not going to listen to this
this perspective anyway but uh i read over just sit in front of your webcam and talk i read over
my scripts and i'm like am i repeating myself here when i say this no this is the reason i'm
saying this i do it a lot and i'm just i'm fine with the idea that i've done it i think that i
have done it it's just that it's a fine line sometimes in the scripting process where i'm
like will this be necessary um there's gonna be a line uh in part five i think it is where i
re-explain the problems with uh the stormtroopers in the first order and i actually say i've
explained this in part one but since that was more than 10 hours ago i'm gonna explain it again
because it might be lost on you at this point and that's fair that's fine um just just running
over a few details so if you're like you repeat yourself there be like i did just to make sure
that uh people are hearing it but you know what i'll throw in a skip option now knowing
how people feel about listening to a thing they've heard already
yep this is the pattern that underlies all of mauler's content an illusion of deep analysis
until you really give it any critical thought on near on every occasion three quarters of the
video are taken up by a bloated wikipedia summary interrupted very occasionally with a
shallow observation about something mauler does or does not like i think i found it i think that's
demonstrably untrue i found it insulting that he used the words critical thought while saying that
sentence um you've not said anything jack you've just stated as a fact so you gotta have some
references but i think if i think if we went to those videos of yours and we tallied up
the time you spend just saying all right here's what the scene is and then compare that to here's
what i think about it here's where it's wrong here's where they could have done instead
i think it would be incredibly bloated towards the latter where once we hit 1420 which is soon
we're gonna have a little experiment as to exploring jack's points about my videos and
we're gonna see how valid they are it's gonna be exciting but for now i'm just gonna say
mauler doesn't say anything deep but he's pretending to be deep he just summarizes and
then says something shallow that attains to how he doesn't like or dislike the thing it's like
okay jack prove it okay this fucking annoying droid lives matter piece of shit is apparently
in all of the episodes that feature the fucking falcon i didn't even think you could ruin a ship
but you found a way disney you fucking found a way so now i'm confused because i thought we were
talking about the critique videos but now we're jumping to the rage videos
and uh is this claim that i've just said what i don't like after doing plot summary and i'd be
like sure someone said georgie lives matter um so if you want me to explain it to you uh the
the ranting in the video is obviously scripted it's for entertainment purposes but it does represent
how the movie can or may have made me feel um so it could be amplified by that i really like
the millennium falcon personally and when i found out that l337 is the millennium falcon
that annoys me can't say that i was thrilled so that's what that little sequence is it's supposed
to make you laugh while also feeling a little bit like yeah that's kind of how i feel about it too
entertainment is the primary focus of the rage videos now will i ever make an objective argument
in a rage video uh i don't see why not if especially if it bolsters an argument but will
i make a more subjective probably claims in in a rage video compared to a critique probably
it's it's supposed to be a passionate rant i thought the title would help yeah it has the
word rage in it unbridled rage which doesn't apply to deep studied criticism i've got his take on this
if you want i had a discussion with him about this in the comments oh i would love it i've snapped
confronting the rages i've snapped his first comment from that we're gonna do comments at
the end but we'll uh all right we will get jack jack will reconcile this contradiction um in a
comment we're going to address it at the end but so we're just presenting the counter argument to
the video first also i need to lose so discuss amongst yourselves um so uh the the bet what is
the best kind of tree the best kind of tree oh i get it he's a dog um volverith said it's for
people who didn't watch your videos so it's fine that's the quotes are out of place um the the
the other aspect of this is that um taking that one piece of my solo rage video which is i believe
over 40 minutes over 45 i can't remember specifically it's interesting because it's like
would you like someone who is a huge fan of this channel do you believe that he's represented
the video correctly if he's taken one seven second clip at most out of what is nearly an hour
potentially like for me personally again if i was jack's friend i'd be like i don't know dude like
i haven't seen that video is it really mainly that like sure you could at least get three examples
in a row uh i don't know i might check out the video just to make sure and then you watch and
you're like oh he talks about how Han Solo has been fucked up in the film and is also
contradictive while behaving strangely in terms of like goes through a similar arc to uh the fourth
one and you hope all star wars depending on how you'd like to refer to it uh the the climax is
beyond confusing for what everybody's doing in that room and why they planned for what they did
in terms of what their goals are like i break all that down talking about how they've spent
extreme amounts of money on the movie and it's all in um the practical effects and sets and you can
be like what's wrong with that and i'm like oh well my theory is that uh what people are complaining
about with the prequels a lot was that the everything was cgi quote unquote while the
ot was everything was practical quote unquote so you'd be like hmm let's have practical practical
to the fucking crank that shit to 11 and you're like oh and they did and it's it's shown in their
bleeding budget along with the reshoots um what else did i say like i'm just trying to remember
the more substantive points that go beyond me just ranting and making funny jokes sort of thing
that's that's kind of what i'm getting at here and i just feel like it's a little bit unfair
to say that that's what's going on in these videos more so than anything else
yes that's that's my contribution here yes i think we need to get jared's input personally
i think you'd say i did it okay the way i did it
why are people spamming tree emojis in the chat i've seen like three now i think
uh rags peen on a tree tree milk can you milk any tree it's called sap why would you ask why
instead of knowing you should know what can and cannot be milked this is a plot hole yeah i can
ruin everything um jay i need to ask you something sure is it about a film i have i haven't seen
or should i answer that question i mean answer it by going on with what it is you have to ask me
well there's there's some things that some people have seen that you may not have i just wanted to
know if perhaps you have or have not seen them sure let's let's do this moon i actually saw the
first half of it then realized i was alone in a dark room where the lights didn't work and thought
maybe not now because it seems kind of creepy uh that doesn't count x machina yes her i love it

oh my god monty python in the holy grail yes gattaca no what huh do you want to do you want
to put that on course until we find another possible break no we have to go over everything
this is why the stream is going to be 12 hours i'm literally going over every movie that i own
beginning in 1829 do you like me to just record a clip of me saying i haven't seen that and then i
can leave for the duration of this part and you can just play that on loop oh my god there's so
many movie suggestions and um all right space balls chat kitch i've not seen twilight why would
you ask me that have you seen thumb where's the phantom cuticle i've not seen twilight new moon
stop asking me twilight films i just cannot fathom how you have not seen stand by me i mean even it
that was like one of the kid one of the movies i watched as a kid like over and over and over
i love that movie sandlot i'm still a child oh god he hasn't seen the sandlot come on
bubble boy said is there a film that you think is objectively bad but you really enjoy
and think is subjectively good or well just you like subjectively the room
yeah the room yeah yeah my batman and robin i always say annihilation
um um what i meant to say is well i mean that's fine um the the this clip that um
the jack used by the way i do go on to explain uh why it's an issue as well that and how it happened
and what doing that to the falcon is doing you know like things that this this uh introduction
introduces this is the funny rage part and then i'm like by the way this is the actual
reasons why this sucks i do in the predator video as well but it's like leave those bits out
those pesky what is it in that pesky context off remember to turn off that pesky context
it was matt a piece of shit is apparently in all of the episodes that feature the fucking falcon
i didn't even think you could ruin a ship but you found a way disney you fucking found i stand by
that statement how the hell do you ruin a ship but it's like you did it all it has to do is move
people around and you fucked it hey rarely with any real thrust to his arguments hey jack what does
it mean to have thrust to your argument also what direction is the thrust going in that's very
important what position is it a downward thrust it's a downward yeah i like it i like it
is total look involved donald would approve of jack's videos is apparently in the episodes that
feature the fucking falcon i didn't even think you could ruin a ship but you found a way disney
you fucking found a way rarely with any real thrust to his arguments rarely elaborated on
as he sacrifices depth for breadth and as you hurl towards the conclusion after i don't think
yes he's saying i do that's it i that's an interesting opinion you have there people on
their team if you will for this actually consider that criticism where they just go
like for example all wolf's videos are blue screens and noise i've said it so that's criticism now
and well it's just like that's uh this is just nothing in relation to my stuff and it's like
yeah but it's criticism though so you're fucked five hour long rant rant you know little more
about the film than what happens in it well this is just a 53 minute rant and i'd actually
argue there's a bit of a ramble on eric's part because he does seem i think he may have had a
script and then he's sort of going off script selectively that yeah just man just sit in front
of your webcam and just talk with a few errors and oh wait sorry let's go back a bit rarely
elaborated on as he sacrifices depth for breadth and as you hurl towards the conclusion after a
two to five hour long rant you know little more about the film than what happens in it
with a few errors and whether some guy on the internet personally enjoyed it how what what
else is there that wouldn't come under those two things because a theme would happen in the film
so what the errors would also happen in the he's like what happens in the film and what the guy
thought of it it's like what statement can you make about a movie and a review that wouldn't
come under those two one of those two things yeah name a movie reviewer who doesn't do that
because he's talking about like what i drew from the last jedi was that in my life you know i
failed several times and i realized that those failures are precisely what brought me to my
success and so i i really am you know i really connect with the last jedi's lesson i'd be like
okay and that's that's fine and that's in the movie so he's still talking about what is in the
movie and then what he got from it you know so i don't understand like because he's he's they're
always arguing for depth meaning stuff like talking about themes which i do so i don't
even know why they're saying that but whatever fans of course objecting to this assessment as
they believe he digs into something more it might be a problem for someone else right but
it's a problem in their subjective lens it doesn't make it objective that not talking about people
on that it is a problem factually some defenders of mullah style of a nap see so what was wrong
with that yeah so jack's accused me of um he's going to at one point in this video but i think
you may have done it already where i'll just state a thing but i don't actually explore why
it's bad and he's just done it there for me yeah that's so keep that in mind folks yeah
oh how did i know that he was going to bring sargon i just knew it not talking about people
it is a problem factually some defenders of mullah style of analysis assert that maulay that's not
by the way that quote that's not to say that any objective floor is a factual flaw it's the specific
one we were discussing in that conversation which again context that pesky fucker is getting in the
way but sorry it's a bit more than just don't include it uses multiple lenses of critical
analysis to see the work from as many sides as possible and that's what justifies this from there
so uh sargon did make a video in defense of me and i actually quite liked a lot of it there's
one point where sargon says the maulah is trying to reach an objective take by exploring all takes
and figuring out what each of the individual ones are lacking and then sort of combine them into a
cohesive whole um as much as i appreciate uh you know trying to make sense of it instead of just
fucking straw manning me like a lot of people like to do i don't i don't do that um i'm just
trying my criteria is just what's there what's provable and they even say this in the video at
one point that that's kind of what i'm going for um and when you come to provable there are things
that i will miss there's always gonna be things i'll miss because i'm human then people would
be like aha so it's subjective and i'll be like no that means i made a mistake for fuck's sake like
so you know you could call that a world view thing or whatever but yeah i don't uh i don't
come at the last jedi from the mind of um every race every sexuality every political position every
walk of life even different species you know i don't even know that it's possible to do that
um and i don't claim to try to do that uh so sargon may have the wrong impression he'd be
interested to maybe see what he uh what he thinks about my sort of response to that regardless
someone said bring v on then kick v uh regardless unfortunately for jack he's gonna take this
uh argument and argue against it but it's never something i've said so but it's so easy to just
yeah like if just find someone like if i just find if i pay a guy to say rags always loves
murdering people on a tuesday that he'd be like rags this is tomorrow's the day guys tomorrow's
the day buckle up it's gonna be some kind of analysis assert that mauler uses multiple lenses
of critical analysis to see the work from as many sides as possible and that's what just justifies
this format nope you could maybe argue mauler briefly touches on the feminist aspect of a work
i don't touch on the feminist aspects of a work i don't think i don't know why i think i i'm not
saying i've never mentioned it i'm saying to say that i touch on the feminist aspect is pretty
generous to me you know when you mention that some people have a feminist aspect of it um i'm more
the one that mentions that yeah uh so i know for a fact that i say that um in ds2 you can't choose
your gender from the get-go you spawn as a man and then you can choose your gender in about
i don't know five minutes from there and so i find it interesting that when h bomber guy is
summary summing up all the the game i'm surprised he doesn't have any issue with that as a feminist
that's all i said like i i didn't declare that i'm in favor or against feminism i literally just
pointed out that it's interesting as a feminist that you wouldn't have an issue with a game that's
previously allowed you to choose what gender you spawn in with that it's forcing you to be male
immediately and you could be like well that's just a nitpick and i'd be like no sure that's
fine that's fine i i found it interesting that it's not something that would bother him at all
so someone said oh go ahead i was just gonna say the if someone said like see you you do explore
it from the family i'd be like that's i think a bit of an over exaggeration but i mean i wouldn't
even consider it a criticism i'd just be like okay if that's how you think i do it fine
somebody who liked the idea of an apolitical review i mean you're pretty much that
i try to be he's not really criticizing you at this point he's criticizing what sargon said
about you he's saying that sargon is wrong not you well and a lot of people are mentioning in
the chat that of course they talk about sargon because he's on the other side politically than
um sorry j don't you think it's a little bit cheap to take a point that i don't hold
and counter it's cheap but this isn't yeah i'm just saying this is not an issue with this is not
your fault none of this is like something anything you've done wrong the fact that someone has said
your work has this merit or this this quality and it's not something that you even try to put in
your work really is is like you know that's not a problem that you have that's something
why did you even why is this even in the video you know yeah like how many people are really
saying that i approach media criticism from every lens possible like is there a lot of people saying
that about my work because i don't i've never heard that before myself hey mostly just to accuse
female characters of being mary sues but characters okay so let's let's just do that again to see the
work from as many sides as possible and that's what justifies this format nope you could maybe
argue mala briefly touches on the feminist aspect of a work mostly just to accuse female characters
of being mary sues so the implication there is the i believe that i need i need to use feminism
to excuse pointing out a character is a mary i'm not entirely sure of what he thinks mary mary sue
i mean there are male equivalents to that well i was about to say so a mary sue has nothing
intrinsically to do with feminism it couldn't be the result of a feminist creating content
but um it could happen the origin of a mary sues is someone writing a fan fiction they insert
themselves so could be the result of a diversity hire yeah like just leveling with you jack mary
sue and feminists are not intrinsically connected and i don't think i've ever said they are
that's a strange point i mean i mean it's very easy to argue the flip side and say that a mary
sue would make a feminist upset because it's a a very poorly constructed character that makes
females look bad on the screen to see the one yeah a lot of people was obviously saying gary stu
but um people even refer to some male characters as mary sues as if to say a mary sue isn't tied
specifically to a female but but there's this discussion to be had about that either way uh
certain people believe mary sue can be applied to a man and if not it would be called a gary stu
anyway i would recommend the trope talks video on mary sues i think it covers the topic really well
the channel is overly sarcastic productions if you want an overview of what a mary sue is
i would recommend that video by the way is ironic that we're spending so much time with context and
explaining all the how these points are bullshit and the biggest response we'll get to this is too
long it's too long well if i make a video about words are bad and you use words to counter me
then huh long man bad right yeah i was right long man worked from as many sides as possible and
that's what justifies this format nope you could maybe argue more briefly touching the feminist
aspect of a work he's gonna accuse me of that just to accuse female characters of being mary sues
but for much else psychoanalysis post-colonialism why the fuck do i no i don't look at the last
jet i threw post-colonialism you're right what about queer theory queer theory that's the important one
marxism marvel we're spending free we just call it query and save time that's true i'm a fan of
this is why we have jay here you should tell that to just write see if he's like wow
the problem is we spend more time discussing the way that he saves us time than time was
actually saved but but i don't think we're i think we really need to like focus um post-colonialism
what if you don't know what it is wolf that's your fault okay yeah i know what it is i want
to know how exactly he thinks that applies to anything that we do or say his point is that i
don't look at the movie through that lens and so i don't therefore i don't look at it through all
lenses which is not a position i hold anyway but but instead of going through like there could be
a discussion there about what sargon said about looking at a movie through how do we stay you know
true to those particular lenses if we don't necessarily agree with them how do we make sure
our views on those issues aren't necessarily skewed but he just says nope and gets kind of it
and he he lists examples of the lenses but he doesn't really give us any information on how
we could how that might change the way a scene is portrayed or how it might make a scene better or
how the lens that maybe a director sees the world through could influence the final product
none of that stuff is discussed maybe he does later i guess we'll see yeah it's true psycho
analysis post-colonialism queer theory marxism marvel at maul are spending three minutes of his
last gen i analysis saying i don't like to get political but film thinks war profiteering bad
and child slavery bad and that is bad because what yeah that's nowhere near what you said oh wow
so we're gonna go on an adventure folks we're gonna check out my part of the video that he's
referencing because he's just summed up my portion on canto bite as child slavery bad uh animal
cruelty bad and this is bad because disney sorry what was this whole thing makes money
disney makes money there you go so um we're gonna rush over to my video and i apologize for this
but we're going to be watching five minutes of my video um somebody that's too long it's it is long
i know that that's two going going dramatically far uh so 6 15 god can't you summarize this in
under five minutes is a planet you're right that's it's my bad quote i would really prefer to view
these five minutes through a post-colonial lens uh we're gonna we're gonna keep in mind what what
jack has said and we're also gonna keep in mind that eric said i this is part of the section of
i speak so much yet i say so little so here comes a five minute section i suppose it filled with
massive over-the-top security likely because the place makes a massive amount of money this means
that all those animals that her and fin have released will be captured and put back to work
this is obvious as what else would happen when that many centuries are all chasing the targets
when they've been shown to have weaponry they aren't shooting because they're trying to catch
the animals and it's only a matter of time before they do which is dumb in itself by the way as they
cause more damage to the world and grief to the guests than i'm sure they're worth but whatever
what rose has said here is akin to a child's outlook on animal cruelty just free them all
let them return to their homes it is very likely that they can't even survive in the wild that
they've been born and raised in captivity none of this is handled with a lick of realism and
considering this series is being looked at as children's content despite the incredibly deep
themes and the violence what is it that you think this teaches children exactly free animals no
matter what stop mean things from happening if anything this will simply give children the wrong
ideas moving on to fin he is mostly along for rose's ride but he does comment on the destruction
of the casino as a sort of revenge against the people who run the planet the rich war profiteers
now this is actually childlike writing again a glossed view of the world with the bad guy loses
because we broke his toys fin accomplished the destruction of many areas of canto bites
scaring and injuring citizens or tourists while labeling them all as evils he trampled through
without any specific information on any of them only to claim the revenge he apparently sought
what a great character an easy comparison for this is the sad realization that by destroying
the death that was that was one of my favorite parts of the series they did well thank you
death star luke may have killed many innocent stormtroopers conscripted for the sole reason
that they were unlucky and didn't believe in the empire at all who knows this is inevitably going
to happen in order to stop this planet killer from completing its goals here though he is just
rampaging through a random city on a planet under the justification that he doesn't like the people
who live here what about the good people who are here what about the slave labor that may be
serving these people as you trample through what about characters just like you and rose who are
here to find something it is so interesting that a character who's established as unable to stomach
human suffering is so blunderously carving through a complex filled with humans causing suffering it
is almost like there is no care taken with the characters in this film but that's ridiculous
right the carnage is apparently justified by some of these people having profited from war do you
understand what that means they didn't cause the war they simply profited from it they aren't even
strictly evil on the scale they're just opportunists besides that as a disgruntled sanitation worker
for the first order fin should know well and good that when something is damaged in the star killer
base or the supremacy the mess is not cleaned up by snoke or hux or kylo ren it would be sanitation
engineering plumbing or a specific section of people that work perhaps a slave group real
people like finn clean up the messes that he is making right now and he should know this not to
mention this may have no real effect on the rich horrible people of the world because they have
insurance but what does that matter we know they have slave labor so they're just going to use them
thanks to finn there's going to be months and months of whipping and ridicule also that he
could feel better about these evil men who rule this world people feel like this whole sequence
was a moment for finn to grow and learn in relation to the evils in the world while in reality it was
an embarrassing cavalcade of virtues being sprayed across a disconnected and clumsily constructed
plot line finn's new and idiotic attitude is the similar kind of attitude that many misguided
activists have in our world today freeing animals only to scare or hurt them or ultimately return
them to where they were found or they will destroy property in the name of hurting the
one who's at the top of the chain when in reality they only hurt the workers who fix it all this
whole mess on canto bite is the foreground to the theme of war profiteers getting richer and richer
while the young defenseless children of the world are used as free labor for the planet the rich
enjoy this is so unbelievably on the nose it's embarrassing why in star wars would they be using
child labor instead of droids when the droids would be cheaper stronger faster and far more
subservient this isn't tatooine a distant desert planet filled with those who multiply out of
poverty and engage in slavery from birth as a form of shelter and living but at least tatooine did
have droids too they were just low quality this is a luxury casino planet filled to the galaxy's
richest men and monsters why would they even bother with anything but the finest most efficient
technology i know why ryan johnson wanted you to know that these were very evil people oh my god
mark's poor face look at him he looks like he's about to strangle ryan children the heart coming
before her mind and what a surprise look who's scraping up the filth is it a human child i wish
overall so oh wait just nine second bite screams of a child's view of the world and its injustices
the simplistic look at everything wrong with the world and why we should all change our behavior
so that's my take on canto bite as a finisher right so that was like i said five minutes
i said the animals are going to be captured and put back choosing to not shoot the animals is also
interesting because they're probably dealing more damage than they're worth so that's another weird
thing very likely they can't survive out of being captured all of it was made worse when looking at
it as a message for children because it's so overt and contradictive and that's a point of irony
because people will claim that it's just for kids you know the thing but also claim that it has
incredibly deep themes that typically kids wouldn't even understand um fin comments on
the casino damage is like good because you know these are the bad guys despite having no idea
if these people are even evil and that's like intrinsic to the origin of his character so
contradiction again following up with um even if selling weapons to a war was true and bad
it doesn't make them reprehensible because the film itself tells us that they sell to the good
guys too so how do you even justify that and on top of it um canto bite is fine because of
insurance you wouldn't even consider that droids are cheaper than child labor uh faster than child
labor the most subservient than child labor like i said and um who knows what kind of punishment
the slaves are going to get because of this because they helped them all of it is a fucking mess
right so they're all on my points and that was over five minutes so eric says like i i say
nothing despite saying a lot and um jack summed this up with what you heard i don't even like
there is a comment in here somewhere i think i comment on the irony of um disney telling us that
the one percent of the problem when they're a huge massive multi-million dollar corporation with more
money than god it's it's actually insane and like he's got a response to that here i hope i can pause
mostly just to accuse female characters of being nurses but for much else yes what am i looking at
thump thump thump
hashtag thump everyone analysis post-colonialism queer theory marxism marvel at maul are spending
three minutes of his last jennai analysis saying i don't like to get political but film thinks war
profiteering bad and child slavery bad and that is bad because disney makes so can you see this
picture we should improve society yet you participate in society curious i am very intelligent
so he thinks that this is equivalent to me saying disney a contradictive to claim that
capitalism bad when they're the biggest profiteers from capitalism the reason this is not the same
thing jack this is a false equivalency is because that is a peasant potentially working hard to
survive and is thus involved in the society just like all of us are so criticizing society would
be the same but disney are at the peak as a result of the system in the society so for them to tell
us that we should stop this system it's just like what the fuck you guys don't donate the majority
of your money to other people who are struggling yeah it's like a how do you do fellow kids but
for a corporation so they're trying to fool us into something that they're not it reminds me of
when uh in youtube rewind 2018 they had that section to stop and talk about all of those like
essentially hot political issues that youtube youtube's actual actions go against like they
spoke about lgbt issues i believe when they systematically demonetize videos about lgbt
issues it's like you know actions speak not to mention i would i would say that is equivalent
not to mention they're aggressive advertising of what'll happen if article 13 goes through and
they're like all videos will be blank and then it's like you delete channels youtube you're doing
this already and if it was justified or at least they provided justification you'd be okay but they
arbitrarily fucking slash channels no consistency because channels who commit the same sins stay up
it's the same with patreon what i mean is i love youtube um please don't uh i worship the youtube
algorithm um youtube is great finally i love youtube too it's great it's amazing i have no
problems with the whatsoever over there it's a flawless platform i love it it's great i hope
nothing changes i really like susan she's my favorite okay she's my favorite person whoever
personed um so yeah the the shit that's presented in the film flies in the face of disney as a
company and their choices as a company because let's be honest disney are not known for giving
away 70 percent of their fucking earnings i'm pretty sure they're worth like 100 billion dollars
or something so they're the ones that can make a serious impact if they actually consider this a
societal issue and yet they're just telling us that they think it should be if i consider that
a contradiction versus the peasant who is attempting to survive and this little twat says
yet you participate in society not the same thing um but i appreciate the joke i guess so yeah just
another standard straw man it's like mauler thinks that it's bad that they have these politics
because disney am makes money it's just like yeah that's a great way to summarize the whole sequence
which i think you guys would agree right it's more way more focused on the actual consistencies in
the film i don't actually comment on i don't even i can't remember if i say in the video but
my intention is not to confirm whether or not child slavery is a bad thing obviously i
personally think is a bad thing but i'm not interested if that's i don't believe you
it's about how it's executed um if you tell me child slavery is bad and the whole film is about
how beneficial child slavery is i'd be like seems a bit at odds with yourself there movie
okay how many child slaves do you have 17 but that's one down from austria so
it depends on the dates you're trying to give it up constantly buying and selling new ones so
the number of changes a little bit over it depends how you define child it depends on
how you define slave define define define define anyway the point is this video is a joke so far
and it's demonstrably untrue oh they've changed their requirements rags can be on but he has to
be muted the whole time oh well that's that's a distinction without a difference in it i mean i
was going to say like um i wish i could agree but the idea is that if rags has something important
to say then you should be allowed to say it what is it because rags could just be in the audience
at that point if he's not allowed to say anything but he's allowed to be in the call that just makes
it so that he's able to hear the conversation a couple of seconds before everyone else like
what difference why are you such cowards that's literally like saying i'm going to kill you and
then someone i don't want you to kill me okay that's fine you don't i won't kill you so long
as you kill yourself i think that solves everything so i have a so if the video if
it's about who's the video who the video is about does that mean sargon can be in the call
hmm i guess dan alson and lindsay alan should be here too
let's just literally invite everyone who's ever done anything i guess i won't be there then but
still um just i mean i mean that that's just pathetic to me you two are pathetic you're sub
human honestly they're gonna love that comment oh yeah that'll be fucking sour clip quote quote
me on it i think you're both subhuman they're literally that's going to be their entire takeaway
from the stream is they're going to take that quote and so and present that as your entire
argument against what they've said congratulations wolf they're gonna they're gonna take you out of
content well they'll they'll misrepresent your position that's what that'll be yeah oh well
there'll be no reason for you to have said that but i mean he cares about the facts he said i was
gonna say this whole stream is about how they don't do that anyway so why would that be a surprise
like why would i care enough to even give them the benefit of the doubt for anything why would i
care enough to be nice to them when they are so i mean they crossed that line like i really don't
care what they have to say because we can see what they say is just it's just like like you're just
terrible i can't i i i haven't seen this level of just disingenuous bad faith arguments possibly ever
i mean this is like such a low bar i actually i i like want to hug quinton and be like you're
at least not as bad as these two at least you're not as bad as eric jackson and yeah you're like
third worst uh so i think it's worth highlighting by the way is you know that whole sequence for
like five minutes you can argue i am doing a plot summary of canto bite or something like that i
i'm saying you can i'd saying it would be inaccurate wait is that within the part they call
your plot summary no i'm not suggesting i'm not suggesting they've explicitly said that but uh
eric did say that the first was it forward something hours is essentially just excruciatingly
explaining the plot and what i just showed you is in that four hours yeah so i was asking so
if they do think that it's plus me and like this sounds so condescending but guys if i'm still
talking about canto if i'm talking about canto bite and i explain one reason why i don't like
canto bite and then your reaction is okay move on then i go here's the second reason then they're
like oh he's still on canto bite here's a third reason until they hit five minutes and i've done
the 15 reasons or 10 or whatever and then they're like he just cannot move on from canto bite this
is insane i would be like guys you know that's not that's not that how the video is working
um just because i'm still on the topic of canto bite does not mean i have not moved on
from the previous point i don't know how else to say that yeah just if they're counting this as
plot summary that is incredibly reductive and um i guess he does say it's plot summary with
a guy telling you why he doesn't like it i guess that technically is what it is there is but i
didn't say it when i say that uh finn's character is being contradicted i could like that for all
someone knows you know i could also dislike it i didn't even tell you if i liked it or not
that's true that's but that comes into the subjective objective argument which i
still don't necessarily know exactly how they stand on that um anyway let's go back a little bit
marvellous of the screen because it's darker than it was when we started spending three minutes of
its last jedi analysis saying i don't like to get political but film thinks war profiteering bad and
child slavery bad and that is bad because disney makes money as it goes mauler is almost scared to
bring up any wider context from which to view you don't get to call anyone else scared when you
can't even come to a call where there's three people in it this is a point with evidence his
point is that i'm scared to bring up a wider context and he's going to play a clip for it
this is interesting to me disney makes money as it goes mauler is almost scared to bring up any
wider context from which to view a film he gets rather flustered when she implies that the
artifacts were discovered and corrects her these things were not paid for by this woman's ancestors
they were stolen just like they stole everything else the only lens smaller so um he thinks that
that's me saying i'm too scared to uh present my perspective on whether or not uh kill monger is
right i suppose in that he's saying that white people have stolen everything they have that's
from artifacts and stuff um precisely the point of my channel it doesn't matter if i think he's
right or wrong i am saying with that clip it is really awkward to shove that into your character
into your movie um it's it's almost like you're trying to make some kind of meta commentary
i'm not 100 sure of what the film wants to do with that there's a lot of those lines it's really
awkward to listen to as someone who would find it it's to explain this to you jack um it's like
watching someone review a film and they go on a trump rant randomly it's you you just you're like
okay that just happened so when i have a character being like
white people fucking stole everything that they got i'm like okay moving on um sure so it's not
about me being scared to address these things whether or not he's accurate is irrelevant
it's really awkward to hear from the film because it's supposed to be a fucking movie
like are they trying to say that you're not getting political enough in your videos
possibly well you know if he was political in the if he was political in the opposite direction
yeah yeah it's good to be political in my direction but
it'll be political in the way i don't like yeah there's so many ways to go about this but
apparently i'm scared to go into a wider uh lens or something like that i think that's what he said
which again it's just like sure jack whatever you say man plays with the artifact that's what
we discovered and corrects here these things were not paid for by this woman's ancestors
they were stolen just like they stole everything else the only lens smaller really cast and that's
a recurring joke by the way because there's a lot of lines the colonist colonizer that's the one
right that's another thing that happens in the movie that's just like oh okay it's just weird
considering what condo wasn't ever colonized it doesn't even make sense in universe woman's
ancestors they were stolen just like they saw the you know the rest of what what that would
have been colonized places near wakanda surely oh you're suggesting that she would be able to draw
the ross is american and the original americans would have colonized the native americans
but the original wakandans what what i'm just excited for him to say wakanda because i don't
we're nearly there oh it's infinity war fist no no this is the fuck i can't remember apparently
jack is waiting for me to explain how my subhuman joke doesn't make me mad wait you don't you don't
make me mad you don't seem mad oh i'm i mean is he asking for you to justify the claim or
i don't know i don't know if i mean i'll give i don't really want to get rid of the doubt
matter if you're mad or not
i mean honestly we already he has huge issues with any of the insults or or whatever you use
oh grow up well no what i was gonna get at is like jack like you gotta understand fundamentally
wolf thinks you've done something much much worse so it doesn't really matter to him because i'm
an adult i stopped caring about insults back in the eighth grade what's his twitter handle i
haven't haven't got um jack saint i think or lacking saint at stupid cunt you can't say that
that's an insult and that makes people feel bad uh oh i'll give as i get you know i don't care
if you say insults because mauler i mean the first time that i ever spoke to mauler
he insulted me and that's how we became friends i don't care about insults i care when you lie
about people when you are very disingenuous about them you misrepresent and misrepresent them and
take them out of context that is much worse that is infinitely worse than calling someone stupid
or subhuman or retard grow up you would he would apply the exact same criticism back to you would
say you need to grow up and stop using those insults oh come on it's a word well this is the
thing this would be the it would get to a discussion about ethics and morals and they're not gonna win
because they've done something much worse nobody's gonna say that calling you stupid is worse than
misrepresenting you to an audience it's like hey chat way more damaging chat what's worse
um insulting someone or lying about someone yeah i mean i think everyone over 12 would probably
say that it's it's worse to lie about somebody because that's something that's a substantive
thing god i want to put them in like one of those call of duty modern warfare 2 lobbies where all
like the eight-year-old british kids are like swearing at them i want to i want to see like i
want to see how long it takes for them to like break down and start crying so i just want to say
the fact that you have insulted them is just it feels like they're using it as a way to like weasel
out of responding to the arguments you've made like of course because they don't actually have
an argument they're saying yeah they're saying mean things about us why should we listen to the
things they're saying you don't have you don't have to listen to the insult you can however you
can listen to like the proof that we've demonstrated live that the things that you say are
misrepresentations of positions you could respond to that in some way but i'm not gonna hold my
breath on that so let's uh we'll cut back in context from which to view a film he gets rather
flustered when she implies that the artifacts were discovered and corrects her these things
paid for by this woman's ancestors they were stolen just like they stole everything else
the only lens smaller really cares to explore is his own what he calls the objective analysis
i would say it's two lenses objective and then my own personal lens and i'm not sure that you can
consider an objective lens a lens but whatever i think lens in this scenario is kind of a way of
seeing things or how you look at something i guess yeah um and i've stood by this for a while
anyone is capable of being objective and it's not beholden to anyone as in someone claiming
something is objective doesn't mean it's specifically absolutely objective it depends
on what they've said but everyone is capable of making objective statements and that again could
be a difference in how we approach quote unquote world views but yeah but you can do it
or the robot it's kind of like structuralism except more that just takes it on assumption
that whatever he observes as bad when he mentions the robot if nobody watched that stream i don't
think they'd really know what he'd be talking about here yeah um unfortunately i regret using
the robot as an example because uh so many people who disagree with me have misused what i intended
for it um the purpose of the robot was to try and help just right understand the concept of being
objective so as far as he's concerned right a human cannot make an objective claim or opinion
let's say so what i tried to say to him was you're saying it's by them being human intrinsically
prevents it so let's create a non-human entity that can respond to these questions so that when
they come out with an answer and you say okay that is an objective opinion because that person
is not human and i'm like so what if i said that exact same thing as he did that was going to be
the conclusion it's like thinking of hypothetical people to criticize your work in order to improve
it yeah you would use the hypothetical robot to make sure that a story was airtight or that
and instead of understanding that people like jack eric and whoever else have taken it as
mauler thinks that the robot represents a formula for judging film and that we all put the film
through the robot and it's not mauler when mauler doesn't realize that the robot was him all along
and i'm like that's not even close to what the purpose of that was but nice try you're
confused that's my conclusion of this video really i just want to say that out of everyone
that we have ever talked to or discussed or criticized these two are by far and away the
worst i'm getting that vibe we're not even the other way through worse than movie bob
worse than downward thrust worse than patrick worse than cinema sins worse than major lee worse
than shinobi worse than joseph anderson worse than that guy on discord like about him i'd say
they're better than me i was gonna say it's above j level come on well you're you're an ally now we
don't need to include you um just drawing back a little bit like man this woman this makes me
almost like want to apologize patrick sester's we were stolen patrick we're so sorry we thought
that you were that bad you are but we had no idea the scale that we would be dealing with into the
future and just like they stole everything else the only lens mauler really cares to explore
is his own what he calls the objective analysis or the robot it's kind of like structuralism
except mauler just takes it on assumption that whatever he observes as bad is factually and
objectively bad with no deeper consideration well like oh let's see if he has an example we don't
care about how we feel about these things we're talking about what they are and what they do
and if not that the viewer can oh that's not a very that didn't help wow that doesn't
what did that have to do with what he said yeah let's try that again let's let's give him another
shot ever done corrects here these things were not paid for by this woman's ancestors they were
stolen just like they stole everything else the only lens mauler really cares to explore is
his own what he calls the objective analysis or the robot it's kind of like structuralism
except mauler just takes it on assumption that whether he let me look up structuralism
it's when you don't like structures be careful they're gonna tweet about how you don't know
what that is off the top if all your entire argument is invalid yeah so structuralism
uh a method of interpretation and analysis of aspects of human cognition behavior culture
and experience that focuses on relationships of contrast between elements in a conceptual system
that reflects patterns underlying a superficial diversity the doctrine that structure is more
important than function diversity it's come full circle um i mean he didn't elaborate on it so i
guess it's irrelevant anyway effective analysis or the robot it's kind of like structuralism
except mauler just takes on assumption that whether he observes as bad is yeah he just told
us i wonder how many people in his audience knew what he was referring to when he said structuralism
i would have had to bet that it's like 10 at most yeah it's like if i don't know what the word is i'll
google it and find out what the word is i think even people who've heard of structuralism would
still be like i wonder exactly what he means by that but he just skips over it and you could be
like oh mauler typical mauler asking for the video to be longer and i'm like i think it would
have benefited the video to be a bit longer he wants us to define words most people probably
don't know but that would be he's gonna he's gonna tweet about that the fact that you've just said
that any snipe is possible i'm the only one he hasn't sniped specifically yet on twitter i think
that is a pretty clear conclusion that i'm the best you're the objective um yes now they're
gonna by the way um uh jack right the i'm reading through your twitter right and it's fine for you
to disagree of course you're gonna disagree with someone criticizing you that's only natural but
it doesn't seem like you really into like doesn't seem like you're really getting the points that
are trying to be put across is my impression of what you're tweeting wow jack just kind of
understanding something you're just kind of surprised sniping at random little bits without
looking at you know the overall arguments being made um it's it's it's people are only gonna see
this as an argument if they already agree with you i uh don't have anything to add to that so
let's yeah i mean the point i'm making about structuralism is that i it's fine to when you
use words like that it just generally helps your point if you let us know what it is you know i
wouldn't assume that people knew what structuralism is yeah it'd be nice in case in case you're
sort of using it for a specific purpose you could at least let us know what it is like
if you ask jack what do you mean by structuralism then he explains a thing that lasts just about
a paragraph i'd be like do you mind putting that in the script that paragraph instead of saying it's
like structuralism or just have it again i don't know he's not gonna listen to me if i suggest you
make the video longer because that's like acid to him he should be more he should be more erudite
someone said um j is like jar jar binks everyone thinks it's the worst addition but he's actually
behind it all he doesn't own the show analysis no please don't say jj pinks don't jj pinks don't do
that jj pinks jj jj pinks so sorry dude that art is gonna come you've got your face off screen
someone's making you into jj pinks they're just gonna have your face but with those weird eyes and
they're just gonna have your face but with those weird eyes and then they move his eyes to the top
of his head this is literally more offensive to me than uh any playground insult that could have
been thrown at me oh i'm just looking out for bayou and i know that he's gonna he's gonna hop
on this it's kind of like structuralism except more that just takes it on assumption that whatever
he observes as good this this fan art i don't actually yeah i don't i don't know enough about
structuralism to be like oh so you have to know what it is you have to have heard of it and you
have to understand it and you have to contrast that with something else like i don't most people
pry not just i find it amusing exists he says it takes it on assumption that um
that what i've what i've blah blah is objective and it'd be like okay so the system is
i look at the scene and i detect the things that are in the scene i present them to an audience the
audience say yeah that was in the scene the conclusion is completely coherent or someone
goes but you missed the red arm thing in tfa and then i look at that i run the information again
and i'm like fuck i was wrong or yep that criticism stands the test of time which the
majority of the stuff in my tlj stuff does um the idea that i nitpick a movie when you're telling
me that i missed the fucking fact that there's a red arm as the biggest criticism like breakdown
of my tlj because he doesn't talk about the tlj critique again it's only eric i think that talks
about it now it blows my mind how much self-awareness you do not have someone said
if somebody did explain structuralism to you then you'd probably just ignore it as being silly
and political um no okay um i will say odd but no i don't think it's silly i just never heard of it
misa won a rhino milk
jack your twitter avatar is great um change your content and keep that avatar i agree i like his
twitter avatar analysis or the robot it's kind of like structuralism except mala just takes it on
assumption that whether he observes as bad is factually and objectively bad with no deeper
consideration we don't care about how we feel about these things we're talking about what they
are and what they do that that example specifically goes against this point that's that's what we're
saying here he's removing his feelings from the equation he's trying to find the truth essentially
yeah he says oh mala only cares about what he feels and then plays a clip of mala saying
i don't actually care about how i feel it's about that is interesting yeah and is that the
best example he could find to prove this i think i think he thinks that that clip proves that i'm
delusional well uh okay as if to say what i've just said isn't even possible to talk about it
without my feelings or whatever maybe i'm giving you as much benefit of the doubt as i can at this
point uh the other the other interesting sort of aspect is that uh i don't know the idea that i
can be wrong is something i often and loudly proclaim but like he's there's no element of
that here that uh he's letting in and because there's this thing that goes around that objective
means 100 undeniably correct um and so if you conflate that impression with what i'm saying
you'll get i hate everything's impression of me where he was like fucking hell it's really
childish and pretentious and condescending to assume that you've got the best take on a thing
and then i'm like i hate everything where did you even get this from and he's like well i haven't
seen any videos and i was like so where did you get it from he's like quitting it's like oh
that makes sense how does it feel knowing that there are people out there who actually exist
whose entire impression of you is what quinton has said about you is it not a testament to why
we have to respond to these tismi videos i mean it is but still oh don't don't put jar jar milk in
the chat you can't give them you can't like tell them don't do it squeeze the titties i tried to i
tried to save them from looking up xenomorphs on google images and i still didn't do i know i did
that and it i did not find anything bad until like i found something slightly dodgy and i was
incredibly disappointed by how i'm gonna go to xenomorph images um did you spell xenomorph
correctly probably not but no of course i did because if if i didn't google would have picked
up on it hmm i mean um there's nothing really there's bite man batman bite man there's batman
fighting a uh xenomorph um hr geiger pictures um i don't think that's what i was being looked for
we don't care about how we feel about these things we're talking about what they are and
what they do uh-huh and if not that the viewer can immediately distinguish between his opinions
and his objective analysis between his opinions and his objective analysis it's all opinions
some of them are objective went over this in the tfa video he even knows how um how i define all
these words and he's like not not approaching this honestly he's not like okay samala refers to this
as objective this is that and this is why he's wrong because these contradictions and then moves
on he's just immediately like that mola sees himself as as making um objective criticism
versus opinions to imply you know because it obviously leads into the idea that the audience
would be like this is fucking all his opinion like i don't know would have been nice if you
threw that in because i know he's seen the video and if not that the viewer can immediately
distinguish between his opinions and his objective analysis but why am i chattering on when there's
cases to study let's have a look at infinity war
so we got i like this part of the video length of video 52 minutes time spent summarizing infinity
war 36 minutes time spent summarizing previous marvel films 10 minutes time spent drawing actual
conclusions about infinity war six minutes um and then he's got comments that are basically
saying wow this is just a plot summary this is all just a plot summary plot summary plot summary
um so this is probably a good time to sort of talk about the whole idea of plot summary but
let's let him talk a little bit i guess all right everyone uh chat go to jay's channel
and find bayo and some references of jay's face so he knows what to draw and post them in i guess
this is in your discord mauler uh is it efap podcast no no no post it in uh to my twitter
just at me on twitter with it i post them in the um the discord after usually no no bayo is trying
to get a reference for him oh is the efap podcast talk in your discord oh yeah yeah yeah so so
everyone go to jay's channel like open up a new tab i'll just change my avatar to a very real
picture of me a very real very real is it gonna be really real is it gonna be very real though
yes are you sure it's not going to be thrump is it it's already thrump i wouldn't have to change
it if it was there's so many different styles of thrump though thrump thrump see i was gonna make
a joke here but i i'm not sure what it's gonna be yet so just just give me some time and i will
decide what it is i really am on the inside and make that my avatar yeah people just go to jay's
channel and put the if you're in maulers then put the j pictures in the efap chat and then bayo and
we'll make jj banks there you go um so i'm uh i'm gonna let this i mean it's infinity war all those
fans have probably already seen it and no those last so wait so he can't make a video if his fans
have already seen it i'm actually in favor of people having watched the movie before watching
my videos on them anyway so were you saying a plot i think you're saying a plot summary is
unnecessary because we've already seen it yeah which clearly me and him have different ideas
on what the purpose of a plot summary is yeah and there's a lot of people who like might be
interested in knowing about the movie or who want to get caught up or maybe they just don't
have the time or they're not that interested and you know going to the theater and all remember
scenes the way that they are exactly the disappearing knife who noticed that the first
time what percentage of people yeah so like it's just we'll we're gonna jump into that in a moment
it's infinity war all those fans have probably already seen that and no those last six minutes
really don't go anywhere what there's not even an argument what is this we'll just so keep keep it
in the end the last six minutes don't go anywhere sad bits made him by the way the sad bits made
him sad the funny bits made him long and concludes that the film is objectively good because it's
good at elaborating on stuff from previous marvel film interestingly i never say objectively in the
video i do in my critiques because i'm more serious about the analysis on that uh appraise
as commented on in the video so i know you've seen it is um an assessment that doesn't cover
any flaws just like how a rage is an assessment that doesn't cover any uh positives i suppose you
could say um uh jay someone described what you looked like in the chat this would be flattering
right yes um he looks like a lacking saint so don't worry well he he said um he looks like
garth from wayne's world but born with cerebral palsy
that's a playground insult which means i can't talk to you anymore
wolf you fucked it up um your face i've changed my avatar to a very real picture of me this is
what i don't insult my manager this is this is what i feel like on the inside what you feel like
and what you are are two different things bounty ball studio said molly you actually say that it
was biased so in the video i say this video is biased so um just fyi for uh you know it'll be
relevant all of this is going to be relevant that's a mark of objective quality by the way
sucks if you wanted to enjoy it as its own movie so uh the suggestion that infinity war is keeping
in consistency and developing the films that came before it is a mark of objective quality and he
said pity if you wanted to just see it on its as its own movie i don't know what he thinks
that he's saying absolutely i mean um what what absolute idiot goes into infinity war without
watching the other movies and thinking it's going to make sense this guy with magic flatmate did
that i mean come on that is that's retarded he watched a marvel summary of all the other movies
first um i'm not sure why that's how he decided to do it i mean that he liked it i mean
go and watch uh captain america winner and try and tell me it makes sense without watching
the first captain america or iron man 2 or thor 3 civil war or literally any sequel to anything
ever people come on i'm objectively gay are you um you are it's not there's three of us now
are you serious all three of you are bi i'm the minority so are you saying you're the diversity
i'm wolf and j and mauler are gay what yes wow that's incredible i can't believe i'm the only
straight person in the room this is kind of awkward normally i don't this doesn't normally
happen but i i had no idea this whole gay is implied i had no idea this whole is what i heard
there right anyway so yeah let's just play this out because we're going to be jumping over to my
infinity wall video and then comparing his statements that's a mark of objective quality
by the way sucks if you wanted to enjoy it as its own movie now as i said before it's not the length
of all this content in and of itself wait sorry i think we've probably gone far enough actually
so yeah he summarized it as um sad bits make me sad the funny bits make me lol and the film is
objectively good because it's good at elaborating on stuff from previous model movies and the
majority of it is either summarizing plot or summarizing plot from previous films that's his
take i'm not necessarily suggesting at this very moment that it's an inaccurate take because it
could be down to semantics but we're going to check out uh six minutes of my video on infinity
um because he'd specified six minutes and it's going from the moment the plot summary ends
um well sorry it's confusing to what he's referring to because the final section
goes from 34 minutes onwards and he said six minutes so i don't exactly know what he's talking
about so i'm assuming it's the part i don't know what the the section i'm showing you
it's gonna be relevant in terms of um what i assume he's trying to say but yeah this feels
embarrassing sometimes because i'm just like showing my video but the point is to sort of
explain why he's uh got a bad take on it not just to be like guys watch my video um so here goes uh
according to my timestamp it ends at 50 50 so it's the longest take it's horrific the powerful
intelligent and heroic vision dies as a man but perhaps the most impactful moment goes to a
particularly powerful road being drawn to its close tony stark has been through a lot in his
series of films finding that he must balance his urge to protect earth while living the life of a
man well what if i didn't if you didn't you mean when you finished leading him to protect his power
nuke his power automate his power submit his power and finally to keep it as insurance to
maintain a safety net if ever he or his loved ones were attacked but never in pursuit once he knows
that this coming attack is what he's been waiting for for six years what sent him into anxiety
attacks what has consumed him since he saw his vision he fights it to the point of leaving earth
solar system and to the realization that pepper the person he loves the most will never come
between him and his will to prevent the suffering on a universal scale this is very much the
reflection of thanos himself with all that happening it's tough to realize that tony has
also dealt with the fact that his dad didn't love him as much as his work his mother or himself
hell he loved cap more tony then sees the tape in iron man 2 that tells him his dad considered him
his greatest achievement and his work was all intended to be left to him his dad absolutely
tony couldn't share any real moments of closure or love with his father despite his desperation
because they were killed by hydra an attempt to steal his formula this destroyed what made tony
so callous as a man in the first place he needed to reevaluate the man he'd become moving on to
civil war he treats peter as his surrogate son brings him in only to tell him to leave the second
he is visibly hurt tony is looking to ignite that lost flame to get that relationship he's pined
for his whole life taking a positive step in that direction in homecoming he keeps him in what is
essentially a box despite spider-man's raw strength he only wants him fighting low life
criminals because it's safe and he's a child mr parker got a sec uh i'm actually at school no
you're not nice work in dc my dad never really gave me a lot of support and i'm just trying to
break the cycle i'm kind of in the middle of something right don't cut me off when i'm
complimenting you great things are about that what is that uh i'm at band practice that's odd happy
told me you quit band six weeks ago when peter succeeds he congratulates him shares with him that
he always wanted this kind of relationship with his father that he's proud of what he's doing
but then to subvert tony's security he lies while trying to get involved in something tony told him
to stay away from peter wanted to go behind tony's back and avoid what was essentially his protection
his care i'll tell you to stay away from this instead you hacked a multi-million dollar suit
so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing i told you not to do those weapons
were out there and i try to tell you about it but you didn't listen none of this would have happened
if you would just listen to me do you know that i was the only one who believed in you everyone else
said i was crazy to recruit a 14 year old kid he was furious and he took the gear back peter didn't
deserve to have it if he wanted to thrill-seek but peter saves the day and iron man's actual
equipment from vulture without a suit and reasserting that he only wants to do good lying
was the way that he saw an opportunity for it and that's why he did it peter is reinstated and their
relationship is strong once again in infinity war he decides to help because he can despite iron
man's attempt to stop him he even goes on what can be assumed as a one-way trip because he wants to
help people what if somebody had died tonight different story right because that's on you and
if you died i feel like that's on me i don't need that on my conscience tony wants him gone
because the last thing he can bear is watching the kid get hurt and so echoing the dream he has in
the opening about a child with a woman he loves called morgan taken away in a moment tony has to
watch as peter is slowly turned to ash in his arms begging to stay with him all in a handful of
seconds tony loses one of his avengers he sees an innocent boy trying to save lives perish but most
importantly he has that new and loving fatherly connection severed again and there was nothing
he could do to stop it but it falls on him everything falls on tony stark's conscience
as he was alive to stop it and he couldn't tony now loses the son he never had the team he built
to protect the world and the universe itself nothing he could build or prepare could prevent
it after six years of it festering in his head his nightmare has broken through tony is frozen
unable to emote he couldn't accept it before and now it's real everything has fallen apart
this is it pair all of this with tom holland's heart-wrenching performance selling a peter
parker that has begun to feel death coming after watching all the people he just saved turn to ash
i don't feel so good
you're all right i don't i don't know what's happening i don't want to go
you don't want to go sir please please i don't want to go i don't want to go
he begs tony not to let him go again and again while failing to stand
fading away in his arms the scene was incredible the film itself was a culmination of many running
stories and characters dealing with very human grief and disturbing events reaching conclusions
simultaneously that could rival any kind of television series finale covering strong patterns
of family love sacrifice and death characters giving into the destruction of the universe to
save the suffering of their brothers or sisters families coming to save the day only to be torn
to shreds many characters having to sacrifice what they have come to love for the greater good
and the death the rampant cold death of so many beloved characters the credits of this film play
like an obituary the audience was dead silent a respectful end to a defeating story that still
has more to come this began with iron man but the original avengers revealed the potential of this
series those avengers are a large portion of what remains for the heroes each dealing with
their own issues while being set up to save the day to pass over the marvel mantle to the new
heroes that have been lost this isn't just a celebration of one film and its achievement to
bring together so many of the properties with weight behind them this is a celebration of what
has been accomplished with 10 years of character writing 10 years of trying to create something
that people could become enamored with this spans completely different personality types
completely different plots completely different settings completely different worlds directors
having this style blasted through with writing having space and quality to shine incredible
performances combined with special effects to support this comic book world's realism all of
this took talent time effort and passion marvel should be fucking proud of themselves drama and
comedy are a tough balance but throughout marvel series they have shown they're going to shift it
in one way or the other with infinity war being no exception this is not an entirely morbid affair
and it does benefit from that i'm peter by the way thoughts are strange oh i'm using your made up
names then i am spider-man you said we are going to open wakanda to the rest of the world this is
not what i imagined what did you imagine the olympics maybe even a starbucks cool so cool
we have rabbit trees squidwood blanket of death kick names and take ass i am steve rogers the baby
of a pirate and an angel what was she doing up there the whole time i'm gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off and who could forget this film was an event a triumph each of the crew and cast
involved deserve a pat on the back for bringing a 10-year path to an incredible peak i can't even
tell you about all of the amazing details this film has aside from what i've already discussed
nor will i share any flaws i don't know if you noticed but this assessment is extremely biased
in one specific direction to complement my other recent work in and there we go
apparently jack's uh getting a little bent out of shape by the fact that we just watched all that
yeah he's he's tweeted apparently that apparently not all of that was actual conclusions apparently
apparently he meant six minutes to spread across the whole video
okay okay that's what he's tweeted whatever jack uh so the what do you think the overall point
um what how do you think what is your take on what you've just seen my take is that i'd like
you to narrate audio please my i think the way you're trying to get across here is that i think
you almost said it i might just be re-quoting you because you kind of say it yourself this is a
culmination of previously established events and if you don't bring those events you know to the
forefront if you don't tell people this is what's happened this is what happened here it took us 10
years to get here and this is the result of all those things happening this is the payoff for all
the setup for all the development so it is extremely important that all of that stuff that
happened before is taken along with this i don't know if anyone else wants anything because i was
just going to say like uh the idea because that's just one of the sections i do a character
assessment for all of the strongest ones in the film from my perspective which are Thanos, Thor,
Iron Man, Vision um and not necessarily because of Vision's relationship with Wanda but Vision
as a character himself what he's gone through from Age of Ultron up to now um and they were all
basically you could argue that i am recanting plot from previous films you can do that but i
think it's dishonest because there's a reason i'm presenting all of these specific events in a row
because they tell a very strong story that's been what you could call in the subtext because of all
of these events taking place and these is over because that conversation that Tony's having with
Peter when he's on the barge it's almost funny but then when you actually listen to the words
where he says my relationship with my dad like he's going on about that it's like that's extremely
important but um and it informs so much of the arc that's happening so it's if you've missed it
i am presenting it again and i'm explaining why it's important that's the purpose of all of this
that's what the plot summary is doing it's presenting this stuff to you and then i explain
to you why it's important that's always been my goal i'm not saying i nail it that is the purpose
um uh is this the twitling this is uh this isn't the drawing it's like a preview though
oh my god oh my jesus dear lord what just just imagine when baewin's done
it'll be even better what a palette cleanser that was from what we just watched
um wow that is um that you are your head is made out of ice cream i'd say
i i think you uh which is good because you don't have any bones
oh yeah it's true ice cream doesn't have bones neither do ears or eyes you can't say that ice
cream doesn't have bones that's a generalization no i'll qualify that no ice cream that i've ever
eaten has had bones in it and i had ice cream well clear if if there was a bone in my ice cream i
would be surprised i would have questions have you ever had everybody you down uh you like the bone
in the ice cream i know the way to the bone ice cream yeah if you do not like it then you know the
way to the dcby dentistry so um again by the way he said that it doesn't really have any overall
point like that i thought the point was very clear it was explicit yeah you all you pretty
much say it verbatim and to be honest i haven't actually watched your unbridled praise video yet
that was the first time of me watching that you're not a true fan oh here's the thing that was
like that made me i i'm sentimental deep down and that made me get kind of misty-eyed
oh rags that's a compliment no like that really like thinking about the characters and
that was really really good um everyone type everyone give rags a hug in the chat everyone
everyone press f for my happiness i'm gonna throw wait hashtag happy rags
but no i i don't i don't watch uh there's a lot of videos i just don't watch that's just one of
them that i just haven't seen but i am i am a sensitive soul actually i'm very sentimental
so am i um i mean i would argue i am too but most people think that i don't have a subjective side
to my fucking videos so this objective robot made me teary-eyed yeah i mean yeah you can see me when
i watch the lord of the rings trilogy back to back or when i or when i play ori in the blind forest
it's like oh man i feel like i need to punch somebody to feel like a man again oh man that's
toxic masculinity feelings was i being ironic was i not you decide
uh so yeah we'll we'll kick on i think i've gone drawn it back enough so we can hear his points
again now having seen uh that context he observes as bad is factually and objectively bad with no
deeper consideration we don't care about how we feel about what they are it's made him sad the
funny business has probably already seen it and no those last six minutes really don't go anywhere
he said last six minutes so he's clearly not talking about a collective six minutes
that's true actually you can't sorry jack you can't change the past
says the sad bits made him sad you can't change the past you can kill it if you have to
someone said he looks like a skinny tj kirk oh that's so i mean i kind of see it yeah if you
make it i can see that i can see that you just see that yeah get him blonde hair that's insulting
to tj i don't know because it's like over the side of his glasses and then he's got the bun thingy up
in the back going on yeah it's a it's a strange hairdo it is a strange hairdo it is unusual don't
sully tj's name okay i think it's a lot better than his argument i think it's interesting i think
his hair is i think his hair is actually better than his arguments not that that's a high bar
but my lack of hair is better than his argument um yeah um sorry do you do your creamy creamy
sheave he just said hey baller and wolf i loved your fallout 76 video here's money because you
both deserve it for all the hard work love your boy creamy sheave is he in on the meme at that point
because that was in the clip i'm sure he's a great guy and you guys really deserve it
so back to bald people uh which i am matthew just said he made a list of times he interpreted your
content that's what the six minutes is referring to i think at least he said he just said the last
six minutes like we'll we'll play it again it's infinity war all those fans have probably already
seen it and no those last six minutes really don't go anywhere mauler says and look what the visuals
are that's the shit i showed you guys right they don't go anywhere while you're talking about how
the characters are affected across 10 different movies yeah this is what i mean i was proud of my
infinity war video because it's a lot of passion because i i am a mcu fanboy uh despite the fact
that i will absolutely tear the shit into the ones i don't like i literally despise iron man 3 like
but um i i i get totally invested in civil war is the peak for me i i i was so invested in the in
that final fight and i'll try and make a video eventually to explain why i think it's so well
put together but um this was something i took seriously the infinity war video i was like i
want to really make sure i explain why i think these are so amazing in terms of uh arcs that go
over so much time um but yeah this is his take on on that probably already seen it and no those
last six minutes really don't go anywhere mauler says the sad bits made him sad the funny bits made
him lol and concludes that the film is objectively good because it's good at elaborating on stuff
from previous marvel films that's a mark of i'm so i am so so sorry jack that that's what you took
away from this i am i am legit i legitimately pity you i'm so sorry that that's that's how
what you took away from that i'm only sorry that he has such a dense fucking brain i mean holy shit
how do you come away from that last six minutes thinking that there was nothing there
i mean i i feel like i would have to like shoot myself in the head to be on par with
jack at this point not a rooster's right i'm sick of jack and eric let's just watch mauler's video
yes
wait sorry him lol and concludes that the film is objectively good because it's good at elaborating
on stuff from previous marvel films that's a mark of objective quality by the way
sucks if you wanted to enjoy it as its own movie now as i said before it's not the length
yeah you can you can i don't know what you're talking about jack like yeah you can
consistency for character is objectively good craftsmanship for storytelling if you're not
following this like whatever yeah you can enjoy it regardless even if you even if we never agreed
on the objective quality of alluding to previous things was that has no impact on whether or not
you can enjoy it do you think that every person who went to see infinity war who liked it
had seen all of those movies beforehand
plus that's even if he's right that's not a counter to anything you've said exactly they're
two different things oh yeah well i liked it for mauler's content in and of itself that's the
problem in fact maybe it isn't a problem if mauler just wants to use this for that it's up to him
it might be incredibly tedious for it's generous of him to give you that yeah elite yeah jack gave
you the green light to you your own format thanks jack i chose it thanks dad wanted to enjoy it as
its own movie now as i said before it's not the length of mauler's content in and of itself
that's the problem in fact maybe it isn't a problem jack saved the father of straw bed
it's like a whole field of straw bed with these i shall build my enemies
problem if mauler just wants to use this for that it's up to him it might be incredibly
tedious for me but certainly many people may like it many people may like it it seems like
he agrees with the whole subjective objective thing doesn't he yeah some people may like it
um you know some people is in like about 70 000 more subs than you have well here's the thing
he can't say it or else he'll lose all of his friends he'll turn into enemies now you can't
you can't make this about numbers especially since he has more subs than me i like i like what
carry how wait how big who is well what probably doesn't mean i never heard him before 42k oh how
i haven't seen these other videos uh or erics like i said i don't know the quality of their
channels i'm just not impressed with what i've seen yeah maybe they just hit 42k so who knows
i literally just hit 42k in the process of this dream remember this is this guy subscribed i just
want to remind everyone this guy made a half hour video about why he doesn't like the npc meme
oh oh okay i like the npc mean i find it funny thanks for kind of helping the point of a meme
by making a video devoted on why you don't like it it's kind of the same things when h bomber guy
was like you know the soy boy meme it's not even accurate it's like oh that's you don't
you don't need i mean i'll admit his point about uh paul joseph watson was really funny but
don't you mean paul joseph there were people making or joe paul's if watson
it's like it's kind of a meme that the left doesn't get memes but
prove a meme wrong factually and then the meme dies and it's like that's not what happens
literally every political orientation says other political orientations don't get memes i'm not
no i actually i think that the left it is mean from what i've understood it's more said that
the left don't but it's not like the right to never fucking have a moment where they
misunderstand a meme like obviously that's going to happen too yeah the left can't mean
but like the npc meme as i understood it is applied to anybody who barks like a political
or a response that that's usually in a political conversation it could apply to someone on the
right or the left but the left got super offended by it and it's like oh so it's implying that they
they're like this is already about us that's how i always understood it i was like but it's on the
right as well because they they can do it you know the right say sjw sjw that would be the npc
vision tim paul's done some good videos on memes and how they spread on the internet and the left
and it's it's interesting but i think there's a lot of truth to the generalization imagine making
an entire video about why you don't like a fucking meme well maybe it's a good video we haven't seen
it you don't know well oh my god if this video is indicative of everything i don't think i want to
in fact maybe it isn't a problem if maula just wants to use this for that it's up to him it
might be incredibly tedious for me but also don't fret uh this video is going to get much faster
because um eric's uh once eric comes back on a lot of the stuff that he says is very agreeable
quickly a quick two approach do you have the sensors ready don't spoil anything i gotta make
sure you remember we gotta protect our it's not mine to write off as an artistic choice as the
format from which to hang the argument for your case the interesting part of arguing about art
not so much at least not the way this time is utilized thanks for qualifying that
oh that's just fantastic i believe this is the qualification
yeah but this is not okay i'll have to explain why this isn't a qualification let me play it in
full so it's not said that we didn't from which to hang the argument for your case the interesting
part of arguing about art not so much at least not the way this time is utilized
that's just fantastic
dude embarrassing me from the wizards that's just a fantastic comedic line
uh he's from space he came here to steal a necklace from a wizard brilliant so funny
so uh you say something good three times that means the video's bad um you may or may not know
in my rage videos i usually have a portion where i say that's just silly at least four times
around that in a row i go yeah i state a thing and i say that's just silly and um someone could
be like but mauler you're not qualifying why they're silly you're just saying they're silly
i'd be like oh yeah i think that they're so silly that i don't need to qualify and it's
a part of the entertainment uh factor so i understand that you have a valid perspective
on that but again these um these are unbridled rages they're supposed to be entertainment first
running through a several several sort of perspective so me asking questions in a funny
manner is actually a part of the entertainment value he was the one who made the sky highest
fascist video i haven't seen that um okay i've heard of it so in the praise video when i was
constructing the praise video i was like how can i make it an inverse of rage in more ways than one
and i was like well you know the parts where i say that's just silly what can i say instead and i was
like what about that's just fantastic you know just just declaring that the thing is good without
explaining it and now unfortunately for jack he's probably not aware of that being a structural
element so he's assumed that that's me trying to explain my point you know and i'm declaring
something's fantastic the irony being that he's already done this to my videos in this video he's
shown a clip and just said that's bad moving on and it's just like okay nope but um the the more
important part that um it's a joke i'm saying that's fantastic as if to imply i'm i'm just
laughing at that that's funny as rags uh pointed out but the important parts so characters
going on long arcs and experiencing thematically relevant journeys i explain all of that explicitly
i don't explain the joke to you that's true i don't explain why a joke is funny because that
could be tough sometimes it's just yeah it's a little explaining why you find things funny
but this is another problem why you find things like sexually attractive it's just
if either you hate my channel or you haven't seen my channel and you watch this you're like
guys do you you watch that mauler guy and they go yeah he's great and you go
he literally like says oh this thing is bad and then moves on and when it comes to films he likes
he just says this is good and moves on then the person you're talking to will be like no he doesn't
though and he'll be like you need to see jack saint's video and then they go you need to see
jack saint's video being responded to and that's the process i like i like that someone put in
jack saint in the chat with a bunch of npc style um yeah this is again the reoccurring theme of
this video is that he's mixed up rages and critiques and uh we'll get to his response
to that at the end like i said doesn't doesn't the fact it's got themes make it good
i agree with you actually this video has themes therefore it's
irrecritable that's so weird now it means you can't criticize it everything that i make into
the future by the way will have a theme even if i don't mention it or if it seems like the theme
of inaccuracy no the best way to convey a theme is to literally just say the theme in the movie
i've always liked that because i don't like to think it annoys me
someone's gonna get that context fuck kids kids are annoying damn them uh yeah let's keep going
infinity war is admittedly a kind of unfair example maula really does phone this one in
it's just running through the film seen by oh damn so like this is a genuine response to this
jack kindly fuck you simple as that uh i worked really hard on that video
and it's something that i consider a little closer to me for media than a lot of
standard pieces of media i don't know i really care about tony stark's uh journey and so the
portion i showed you was like what i consider to be the crown jewel of of the part of the film that
i really enjoyed and then i move into talking about it as a whole and he's just like he phoned
it in it's like thanks man so you can phone in and make better content than he can try it i would
never i guess is that what the theme of that statement was i guess what else can we draw let's
go to the worst fucking benefit of the doubt possible and do back to him what he likes to do
with our work right why not saying the bits he liked i guess maybe he thought the more of his
video was taken up by summary the more objective the critique was nope the purpose is so that
people follow along when they're watching whether or not they've seen the film whether or not they
remember the film and i really like it when people do that i like to know we're moving to this scene
and then this scene happens and then we're here now because when i watch a movie i can't remember
every scene in chronological order in every event that takes place well him and him and eric have
basically said that you're you don't exist rags because they're like uh i'm watching this video
i've seen the movie mauler what are you doing it's like i saw it too but i want i want to be
reminded of everything that happened so that i don't forget about something and by the way i'm
not saying that every single portion of my plot summary was absolutely intrinsic to the video
there's probably some things i could have cut and the video would have survived i'm simply suggesting
the reasoning for why it's there i'm very aware of why uh you might find it clunky and unnecessary
but you are not everyone that's basically the lesson you should learn here i mean watch if
you want a perfect example of why his notion of objective critique is so flawed in the first
place as he largely skips over what he has elsewhere acknowledged as clear and fundamental
holes in the filmmaking so his point here is that i've accepted publicly that infinity war has flaws
and it's not in the infinity war video a video in which i say i am not going to talk about the flaws
it's worse than that dude it's worse than that i say it explicitly after the section he was
referring to as being without point well at least it's like when cinema wins he talks about film i
mean you know what he's going for from the outset like he explicitly states these these are great
things about this movie i just i'm gonna focus on the great things about it that's fine that
comment chat jack come on now look jack come on yeah this is uh come with you up music so he's
about to play a clip that proves that i think infinity war is flawed and that that's proof
that i never mentioned it in the video and he thinks that proves something but look how smug
he gets about this the impression that mauler was denoting some things as important and oh wait
have we gone past it um so apparently jack's wife is uh getting salty on twitter too
jack's wife you married that brilliant all right infinity war is admittedly a kind of unfair
yeah don't send jack saint any hate whatsoever people leave him alone all it's gonna do is give
him ammo to say that we're the worst channel ever we're racist bigots and we go out we bully smaller
channels leave him alone he's he's worse than shinobi with this shit he's inventing even more
and more he changes the past and invents context it doesn't exist just to go after people leave
him alone do you think that shinobi is his son trapped in a basement with his toys
this all makes sense now what's his wife's what handle do not harass jack saint
yeah just like he's really not worth your time what about jack's wife's son
music meme um cuckoldry memes offend me mauler really does phone this one in it's
just running through the film scene by scene and saying the bits he liked i guess maybe he
thought the more of his video was taken up by summary the more objective the critique wouldn't
that be true though i mean i mean if it was just a plot summary would would that be make it more
objective though yes but i don't i don't know what his take is on that he just declares it
like okay he uses little quote fingers but that's like you know but unironically yeah it kind of
would be pretty much this happens and then this person does this he declares it as a bad thing
moves on it's like isn't that the thing you accused me of doing it was bad okay if you want
a perfect example of why his notion of objective critique is so flawed in the first place as he
largely skips over what he has elsewhere acknowledged as clear and fundamental holes
in the filmmaking something like that had almost give the impression that mauler was denoting
some things as important and some as not important based on his own biases and so literally described
my video as biased yeah like yeah if only you'd mentioned something about this in the video if
only this is what i mean this is why this stream when i was preparing these citations i was just
like this is going to be easy jack has made this so fucking easy he's he's literally using words
that i have in my videos like what do you want me to do jack just in the discussion i had with him
in the comment uh the way he justified uh conflicting this is like it's you know i say
clearly the intention is different you can tell it's made very obvious and he says but the content
in them is the same and like that that is super surprise his justification for conflating the
praises the rages and the critiques is that the content is apparently the same he's literally
criticizing this one specific video for being biased while ignoring other videos he's not
saying that videos so on on that note let me read the description of mauler's unbridled praise video
is the description of the video that's open instantly i have no idea what this thing says
right now yeah so i figured since i make a lot of content that is negative about film i had an idea
to try and create a sister series to my unbridled rages the idea is to try and praise the film for
the things i thought were great while leaving the flaws out of the analysis basically the complete
inverse of what you often see on the channel i'll pick this back up with other films if you guys
enjoy it i really tried to nail the editing in the script though i wanted to get it out quick to cover
the topic marvel really did pull something amazing off here a flawed series but an unprecedented
one nonetheless let me know how you feel about the video wait so what you're saying is you're just
a rip-off of cinema wins that's that's quite amusing isn't it that's because the rage and praises are
technically cinnamuses and cinnabar wins in what they try to do question mark i mean it's not as if
those channels came up with those concepts of sure one thing to talk about another thing
but but yeah no i think it's a fair comparison i just think that i'm more consistent than
cinema sins and cinema wins from what i've seen but that's you know not not too declarative i'm
just uh i've only made one praise after all it's so far incredibly different approaches to you is
what i would say since i've seen most of your content most of their content as well actually
i've never seen a cinema since video i don't know i mean watch if you want a perfect example of why
his notion of objective critique is so flawed in the first place as he largely skips over what he
has elsewhere acknowledged as clear and fundamental holes in the filmmaking something like that
had almost give the impression that mauler was denoting some things as important and some as not
important it's just right in the description man the description in the video and technically in
the title because of what praise means but i'm sure jack i mean it's right fucking there you
didn't even have to watch the video the description is available from the first second that the video
plays his own biases and so his critique is unstructured in two different ways
his critique see he thinks it's a critique it's not how i describe it at all but okay
well let's see if that panther clears things up there are several highly advanced he's about to
pronounce Wakanda that's true we're new there but let's see these these all in a row
so long well let's see if that panther clears things up there are several highly advanced
pieces of technology and architecture everywhere but actually they have thatch style huts embedded
into the structures what is with the location and everyone's outfits and the weird war paint
stuffs i mean guys seriously why the fuck do you use spears by taking the flower power back and
burying yourself in large amounts of sand you are able to speak to your father through dreamland
i guess how exactly did tony and his father not find out about the properties of vibranium people
getting stabbed and slit to shit but absolutely no blood can't even go with the red lines and the
bodies come on guys this film doesn't even explain why he's called the black panther so first glaring
point um the concept of cherry picking but let's assume that all those points are awful for the
sake of the argument it's not really fair considering the representation of the whole video
and he does account for that in a moment he says something like um he agrees with me that the
opening isn't very well written and i'm like i'm just sitting here like really jack like uh
what about the villain making no sense at all in terms of his origin and his plan being based on
luck and uh to charlotte not doing much of anything in the movie making lots of confusing
decisions there's a lot of um fundamental criticisms i have right in and amongst ones like
uh less significant ones however i don't actually think that the criticisms i raised are actually
insignificant and some of them he's going to assume are objective plot holes like that
selection you'll just anything that i bring up he will label as a plot hole and it's like it's
embarrassing for me as as someone who gets accused of being so amateur it's like you realize there's
more to flaws in film than plot holes yeah like whether or not we learn his name is black panther
or not that doesn't mean it's a plot hole it's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about how
every single superhero is tied like they have a real name and then they get given their superhero
name and you're like okay i'm curious as to how that would occur because everyone gets a natural
name and then each of the movies will give us context for it while black panther it's just the
way it is and you're like okay again not a plot hole it's just like okay then you do you want us
any like what's the problem why are you asking the question it's like i was curious about it and i
don't know why they didn't why can't i ask why can't i ask what's wrong with just asking i'm
asking and then he's like you do kind of like pronoun the way you say it does kind of sound
like you consider it to be a flaw do i that's it's a good question do i consider it to be a flaw
um but the thing is like as i've been over in the video that he's also seen the the car in the
background lord of the rings that is a flaw okay but it's like its relevance is so low but i still
mentioned it in that video you get it like it is a thing and you could be like uh the car is a flaw
because if you really want it to be explained you'd be like cars don't exist in lord of rings
universe therefore it can't be there like that would be the the argument i suppose the continuity
issue i guess i'd categorize that consistency with the world yeah i'm not even sure of how i
would categorize that but um just the slip up that they didn't catch the black that didn't really
an editor it's just that um they didn't notice it until the movie was already yeah it's like
it's an in universe mistake and an out of universe mistake and in fairness i the only reason i know
noticed it is because someone else pointed it out to me because it's such a blink and you miss it
thing yeah it's the same for me yeah i guess the point i'm making is i throw those in the video too
but if you collect any and all nitpicks i've ever made and then say that this is all i do
like quinton did and like jack's doing yeah you can definitely make that argument
it's just the context will kill the argument which is the crux of the stream basically um but hey
you know let's see his take on it dabbed and slit to shit but absolutely no blood can't even
go with the red lines on the bodies come on guys this film doesn't even explain why he's called
the black panther you know cinema sins yeah this is just cinema sins what do you mean jay
why would you say that i've never heard of them i don't know who they are this is someone just
running through a movie point by point occasionally calling out things they consider bad plot holes
occasionally it's the whole video yeah it's the whole video the construction of the video is
supposed to be that i provide i'm talking about all the floors and i give you enough plot summary
to be able to understand the context of the floor and he's just described it as bad plot holes this
is what i mean about how jack seems to think that anything and everything i talk about equals a bad
plot hole it's like it could be anything there's loads inconsistencies and conveniences are like
extremely different to start but they could both be categorized as plot holes by jack i suppose
editing errors are not plot holes um the film is complicated i i feel so condescending explaining
this it's like there's just so many ways of like a like a child you know it's not just plot holes
that's the i guess what i'm trying to say about really commenting on how it fits within the
narrative or making so you said i don't comment with how it fits within the narrative jay you
didn't like my black panther video that much but do you remember me mentioning how any of the
criticisms are relevant because of how it fits in with the mcu i'll be real i've blacked most of
that out of my memory at this point okay okay um the the one i use is that um the weaponry and
armor and their abilities and the metal and all that stuff by the end of black panther they're
they're telling us that they're introducing it into the world and so i'm like what prevents them now
from if they're going to share this kind of shit like isn't it going to spread and and the arguments
of um i would have the same argument for tony's nano uh machine technology and the same uh for a
couple of different things it's just like this is undeniably incredible technology and the world is
facing a threat start mass producing those black panther suits if you know what i mean nope only
for black panther so that is a highlight of an issue when the world is at stake
isolationism isn't really going to be a reason for why you won't let people have weaponry
if you know what i mean um and they're not even isolationist at the end of the movie so
what i'm suggesting is what i'm suggesting is that it'll be an issue or um uh the the
world and he's just said like i never explain how it'll be relevant to anything else i'm like i'm
pretty sure i do that in the black panther video yeah this is all just cinema sins this is someone
just running through a movie point by point occasionally calling out things they consider
bad plot holes without really commenting on how it fits within the narrative or making an argument
for why these things actually matter so the argument i make for why it matters like i just
need to pick one and he's wrong so like um why it matters that they kept a secret for killmonger
instead of just taking the child back with them to wakanda or instead of letting the people in
wakanda know that this was a thing that even happened they don't tell us why they don't
there's no reason for it they do keep referring to it as the secret they had to keep and i actually
think considering i think it was wolfa told me there's supposed to be some kind of three-hour
cut for black panther it might be i think it was i think it was much longer than three hours
i think it's in there probably because you just need a couple lines to actually connect the dots
for why they would be motivated to keep it a secret but they never actually have a moment
in the film to do it and i think it was just missed but it creates massive problems for
understanding um the motivations of the king and the wakanda itself i'm sure you'd all love to
watch black panther but for three hours right yeah that sounds like something you would all enjoy
definitely yeah both of those claims can be countered with context just just reoccurring
theme folks why these things actually matter to the text matter to them or should matter to you
just as infinity war was a point by point summary occasionally pointing out good plot things across
this video maula makes constant references to things like it being counterintuitive that only
one person in wakonda gets access to feel that case yeah wakonda wakonda wakonda i've been
building up to this for ages and oh is it everything you ever hoped and dreamed it would be it was more
than that oh it's a payoff for past my expectations like a mini-insinity war in your heart
the only one person in wakonda gets access to a special plant that makes you superhuman
usually the king or how even though wakonda is technologically advanced they fall back to fairly
archaic things like rustic looking market trial by combat having strict traditions don't mention that
people using spears he's presenting my arguments here so we got nothing to respond to yeah he's
going to counter them in a moment but he's snarkily presenting them as if they're just
wrong inherently but he is going to provide a counter argument logically advanced society
to use fucking spears sincerely why does anyone use anything if so that's a weird question to ask
why does anyone use anything um i think what he wants to present here is that i could ask questions
like why would winter soldier use a machine gun instead of a gun that could be better in that
scenario you know and depending on the context these questions are actually relevant and he's
about to provide an example from infinity war as if to show that i don't have any criticisms of
infinity war which we've already been over as a mistake on his part that he thinks it should have
been in my video when it was never intended to be in the video but he assumes that i don't share this
criticism so cure it out guardians why on earth would they make mjolnir a small hammer and not a
because it's based on mythology you dunce i mean well that's not a plot reason though uh it is an
adaption right so we can still argue that they've adapted it with it if you want to tear the as
guardian culture down i think you could do it in terms of um assessing how a lot of it's inconsistent
into the odin and thor clearly very very powerful and hella or hell i never remember who it is in
the fucking movie um compared to all the other as guardians who seem to be kind of shit
uh other than heimdall who seems like decent and then a lot of the citizens are just terrible to
the point where they literally like defenseless and you're like okay so how does the power dynamic
work here because like you know how thor can take getting stabbed and beaten and thrown and exploded
and stuff like those citizens look like they could die from you know just a bullet wound
while thor can't be shot by bullets question mark normal human ones right or am i i can't remember
if that happens in the movie um either way god don't make me have to defend thor it's confusing
he survived being punched by the hulk and like those massive deterrent ships can't survive that
he's a super weapon on legs essentially and so like i don't really know exactly what the
power levels of as guardians are or how that works and then there's like their armor which
almost seems useless against um hella in the movie and maybe that's because she's hella but
this is like wouldn't wouldn't the wolves make like amazing armor it's like no let's just assume
they don't do that and you're like okay uh then then there's the weaponry which you know the the
why why not i don't know there's a couple of things like how does any of this really function
why wouldn't the greatest weapon of all time the um stormbreaker thing not be the weapon that odin
has or maybe thor already is i don't i don't i don't get how any of it really works and um
jack's assuming i don't have any of these criticisms for as guard like i do for wakanda
but i've not made a video on thor criticizing thor specifically but oh man could you yeah um
there's a lot more to thor that i have a problem with outside of the world building
just like black panther their own special meone gun to help protect as guard with
plot hole not a plot hole jack you don't know what a plot hole is you need to watch um
videos on plot holes protect well no the videos he's probably watching
patrick williams williams williams yeah and i guess he doesn't know shit about plot holes then
as guard with plot hole how come the u.s military has had the research notes on cap super serum for
so many decades yet most soldiers are just regular dudes and not thousands of captains so this is a
is a trap because it's obviously blatantly explained in the movie that erskine is the
only one that can make the formula and then the winter soldier ones are made uh in winter well
we've shown that the winter soldier ones are made and that it makes them uncontrollable so
captain america's formula is lost to time and died with erskine um but he is going to argue
that it's explaining captain america just like it is in uh black panther but it's not
it's explained the black panther comics i know that from the amount of people who told me it
but it's not explained in the movie research notes on cap super serum for so many decades yet
most soldiers are just regular dudes and not thousands of captain americas away they actually
address that in the fiction kind of like how they address why only one person gets the black
panthers ability in the fiction of no they don't they don't and the importantly don't importantly
why uh which is my argument in the video that he's just not going to bring up here or counter
is that um your goal is to protect the king and the king is the the black panther blah blah blah
he gets the power in the suit because he's he's top of the pyramid okay so why does he have body
guards it's like to protect him obviously and you're like oh from what why don't well that's
another good question but why don't why do the body guards not have this stuff too to make them
literally the best at their job that they could possibly be you know because they just don't
okay why don't the body guards have the black panther suit since that technology alone would
make you pretty much immune to damage it's it's bulletproof and again you'll be like they just
don't you know like okay um someone made the argument that their fabric is made of vibranium
and that was like the their whole heads are fucking available to a bullet like that would
be the important part that maybe that we want to cover so black panther suits for all and then we
find out that they're literal necklaces that can form around you and sure he could obviously
mass produce them with the amount of vibranium she has mined frequently each day so just like
this is really awkward for you to show me and then i argue that um the entire population of
wakanda could be given these flower things and it'll improve their biology as in they will be
faster more agile heal better be more immune be stronger like you could give this to your whole
population and you'd be like a super race but instead you're like no just for black panther
and the reasoning that he's going to present i believe is that it's like a cultural thing like
they only let the one guy have it but this is not in the movie it's just they just presented that
they have flower power and then they just they give it and you're like okay do they ever explain how
they even mine vibranium i mean we don't need an explanation for like that surely we don't need to
well i guess the logic would be how do you mine steel as a caveman it's like well you have to do
the thing in terraria right you use a lower material to mine a stronger one then use that
mined material to mine a stronger one and then mine a stronger that's what i'm saying but it's
like it's one of those things where you can it's about how deep you want to go with it if the whole
thing about wakanda is that they're super amazing because they have vibranium like well
but if how did how did they turn just vibranium chunks in the earth into some kind of usable
material that gives them yeah because it's implied that the vibranium propelled them past the stone
age yeah and i want to know how how does we like we found this chunky thing in the ground and it's
really really you can't break it we can't i don't even know how we got it out of the ground honestly
but it's just like we've got it so how does that make them super super smart and super combat
effective because if we had if we had adamantium as in just the strongest metal that isn't our
strongest metal currently it doesn't push us into like they just argue that titanium can just do
everything it's like the best technology thing but britain can be used as fuel you can like burn it
and get energy pretty much say it can just be used as everything can be used as little golf balls
that you can put in wounds and then they won't die and you could be like that's internal logic
so it's okay and i'd be like it is internal logic but it's also the most convenient fucking material
that's ever been a fucking storyline it is a maguffin my god i just realized seeing this infinity
war scene and thinking the little balls like what if tachala just pulled out like a bag from his
pocket and he started like shoving balls all across do you remember i made the argument that
if the dad still had the flower power which they would have to remove from him instead of just
letting him keep then uh he would have survived this and you know jay's counter was the you don't
know that that could make him survive and black panther survived it my counter also this is the
one i'd stand by more i'm not really sure like how i've again blocked a lot of that out um i i
haven't really gone back to it very much but my counter that i was more pleased with was
essentially you imply heavily that they like have to get him to give up the power um and my
assumption would be that based on i'm sure he volunteers him as a character yeah that he would
volunteer yeah no i'm sure he would too i'm saying it's dumb though yeah it doesn't and the i mean
in plus what about all the kings who came before he's he's literally the their representative
like isn't it important to keep him in a good state when you're isolationist and you're trying
to protect yourself from the will he knows exactly how to talk about wakanda keep him alive he's very
useful i don't know man okay a lot of it doesn't make any sense but we'll respond mode um we've
hit the five hour mark by the way we have that's too long we have to be quicker how much longer
do you plan on going let's have a look um
could you do an hour yeah could you do more than an hour i don't know if i could do more than an
hour i don't know um we'll try and speed it up but um i really would like to get through the
whole thing because the there's a small addressing of rags at the end um hopefully like i said when
we get to we're nearly to eric i think and eric's one is mostly smooth so we'll just let's go away
they actually address that in the fiction kind of like how they address why only one person gets
the black panther's ability in the fiction of black panther you might not like the explanation
but beyond telling us this is a thing that exists you haven't given an argument for why
it really matters here for everything you simply call out in black panther and then from your
intonation we assume as so he's doing this throughout his whole video by the way he like
through his intonation after throwing clips on screen we're supposed to assume that they're bad
intrinsically there's a couple of them some of them get commentary but in the same way that i do
that in my videos some of the things i just i just snarkily say and then some of the things i
actually explain but i usually do that with the things that are much more significant that's
usually how i roll in the rage videos but again the rage videos are more for entertainment so um
he's guilty the thing he's accusing me of and the thing he's accusing me of is actually by design
they're the two defenders i think um i think it's pretty evident the tone's different but um i guess
some people didn't pick up on that even though it was written out in the description not girlfriend
kills a guy with a shoe i could look back to your infinity war video and find see there's
no context for why that's a bad criticism yeah i mean it seems odd but he's just declared that
it's bad by showing it so there you go jackie guilty of it too similar if not almost the exact
same quote unquote also sorry we should probably say i don't feel i should i feel it's condescending
to explain why someone killing someone with a shoe is embarrassing um and i wouldn't put it in
my movie unless it was a parody like fucking austin powers kills a guy with a shoe i could
look back to your infinity war video she should have just punched the guy why the hell would you
hit him with a fucking yeah don't don't do anything to me while i'm getting my shoe off even uh the
world's end had a better fight scene than that and that was a comedy and find similar if not
almost the exact same quote unquote problems why are there literally two people from dr
stranger's sect protecting the time stone weren't all of the dr strange sect people wiped out
by kycelius outside of morbo or whatever his name is morden i haven't seen black panther i couldn't
but um if that's a if i check dr strange and that comes out true that's a fair criticism
didn't he reverse time at the end to prevent that from happening and that he was sucked in with
he didn't manage to complete it though so i don't know if he managed to save anybody from the last
area if you know what i mean the thing is this doesn't counter any of your points it's like you
didn't mention the criticisms of infinity war that exist when you weren't criticized this just comes
back to how explicit i was about not mentioning the flaws it's literally spelled out for you but
i guess that wasn't enough to spell it out for you single most important thing to these people
look at how bringing in his eric tax and editing here too what do you mean with these people are
we seriously ignoring that they could portal in like he defended this to me when i called him out
on it in the comments by saying oh yeah but the content in the critiques isn't is pretty much the
same as what's in the rages and the praises no well then why don't you use the critiques as
an example since that was you know what you're fucking talking about i agree like a dozen more
of these guys and likely stomp the two people Thanos sends down to grab it just the two way
so even though Thanos has been roving around the galaxy for decades picking up recruits
he only had like five people on hand for infinity war and wait a second and they were his trusted
soldiers he did hire a couple more people and they betrayed him so yeah they had like a like
an army of those like yeah the chitauri army a bit of a weird comment jack but okay
you know so already knows he's planning on using the stones to snap away half of all life
why does he rove around for so long halving populations right up to the start of the film
isn't he at that point just cutting all life by hang on a second um but we don't know when he
discovered the infinity gauntlet thing was a possibility has it has it been do you know he's
cutting populations in half after he discovers it because he does that to thor and his people
that is true and um it would for me it's not a contradiction i don't know if you'd agree with
that it's more of a i'd love to see what he'd have to say about that i imagine he just doesn't like
it's just it's tiny numbers in a grand scheme or something like that it's not a contradiction i
would say it makes less i would i would say it would make sense i wish it would be interesting
if it was in the movie that when he's attacking them to get the stone and he kills half of them
he's essentially saying like it's beyond me i'm killing you sure but it's beyond me because it's
this is the rule it has to be half of you and you'd be like well you're gonna half them anyway so
isn't this just this is a sort of reveal that he kind of enjoys it anyway um but that's not in the
movie either that or yeah i mean you could say that he's doing it manually because he doesn't
he's not certain he can get all the infinities yeah it would be cool to have a line of dialogue
i don't i don't disagree that that could get a bit of extra explanation
free quote i made a video on infinity war and people commented saying that you know previously
they thought it was okay but i have to see in this they were like wow you know it's actually
i was trying to be as objective as possible in explaining how the characters move from x y to z
and why that film is of quality and the robot's analysis of infinity war for example would
probably be that it's like a six or five out of ten i think this film okay so he thinks that's a
contradiction how uh by presenting these clips he thinks that it's a contradiction but like it's the
crux of my argument that i'm presenting only the positives and that if you were to be objective
about infinity war it would probably reach some form of a par because of the amount of inconsistencies
but that shows that you know that there are flaws with it this is the thing it's a film that you
literally spell out that there are flaws but you're not going to talk about them because that's not
the point of the video he's on he's seemingly blissfully unaware of these several attempts
to telling him it's a biased assessment it's amazing how like you literally in that in that
in that debate with just right said um that it was subjectively you love the movie but objectively
not objectively it's not as uh great as uh you know you feel it is and he still manages to miss
that tended for traditional reviewers and they will be throwing out logic as much as possible
since traditional reviewers are the only people who appreciate a lack of logic so this is in regards
to um tlj and it's just a little snarky comment that i think that uh it's dumb that patrick
willams only appreciates the traditional reviewers but they also all happen to love the
last jedi and so my my conclusion is the traditional reviewers just love a complete
lack of logic and so jack is applying this criticism to me saying well you like you you
consider uh infinity war lack of logic and you love it and it's like no jack uh tlj is basically
without logic it's like a one out of ten fucking objective scale if you want me to really go there
while um infinity war it's got logic throughout all of the most important elements being the
characters their journeys what they did how they grew what they learned the themes
those things are consistent it's the wheel building and the the story itself there's
there's issues there's holes uh while with the last jedi there's holes in every fucking respect
so false equivalency is the conclusion there uh oh i think so i don't personally care about
these things because i accept for instance that the first fight in new york would feel
completely different if both sides had hundreds of unnamed fighters causing chaos all around the
city and with the context of the film's escalation of tension potentially throw things off see that's
my argument for why i like that early on the fights in infinity war are only between a few
people i don't know what he means by c this doesn't contradict anything i've said yeah it's
like that's fine you can like it for whatever reasons you want that's different yeah it makes
the massive wakonda fight feel more as if it's been led up it's wackenada the actual name
just another exhausting massive clash mauler jabbing at black panther because it's too dark
to see him well in the opening fight scene is ultimately meaningless he's just saying he doesn't
want you to see so um we could that's another video we could jump we could jump to the other
this other video i was going to do it to show context but trust me just go to two thirty my
black panther video if you want to see me say it i say that um i'm describing the events in this
part of the plot to set up my criticisms of it and i say at least that's what i think happens
because despite being the center of my cinema with a full screen i couldn't see a fucking thing
now that's a statement that is inherently subjective because i just told you i couldn't
see a fucking thing you it's it's it's the fact that i can't see and now he's trying to address
it in a way that i'm saying the film is too dark like like as if the i'm wrong for saying
it's too dark when all i've said is i couldn't fucking see so like it's a bit of extrapolation
on his part and how he counters this argument is hilarious black panther because it's too dark to
see him well in the opening fight scene is ultimately meaningless because he doesn't argue
why this is a problem for the film in alien the xenomorph is in darkness most of the film
yet you'd probably so um does anyone want to crack it this this counter well well you see when it's
too dark to tell what's happening that's an editing mistake that's a lighting mistake
if you can't tell what's happening how are you supposed to be enjoying the scene but this talking
alien you could do that intentionally alien didn't have sad lighting exactly you could do it
intentionally for a reason like in a horror film and even then i don't think alien had bad lighting
you tell what's happening i was gonna say it's interesting something is is like difficult to see
then yeah show it in a way that's you can't tell what's happening but yeah difficult to see for
the characters that are experiencing it in the film and the audience those are two different
yeah to compare an action scene with a horror scene is incredibly ridiculous because an action
scene you inherently need to understand the progression of events while a horror scene
it could very well and this is the thing i use this example in the tfa video which he admits
he's seen at one point so it's interesting to me that he's trying to provide the same counter that
i did to the point in the force awakens flickering lights thing and i talk about how flickering
lights an alien makes it harder for the viewer to discern exactly what the creature is we can see it
but we're still like what what is that what the hell is that and that's by design because they
want you to remain as unaware of exactly what it is for as long as they can it's fucking horror
it's trying to create suspense while in black panther you need to argue from a position of action
if i can't fucking understand who's even hurting or what's happening i'm just sitting there waiting
for the scene to conclude and they go yeah he won by the way i'll be like thanks i was so on the edge
of my seat so yeah the if i made the criticism it would be that it's badly as we'll put it lit or
edited but all i said was i couldn't see it so he's taking a subjective argument and arguing it
against it objectively who have you heard say that about us regularly yeah well fuck you for
not being able to see i mean that was a trick question because it's like everyone accuses that
of us it's just funny when they do it to us it happens all the time it happens all the time
people are constantly guilty of the things that they say that we do all the time yeah let's let's
hear him explain why it's fine to have a dark action scene because horror do it argue why this
is a problem for the film in alien the xenomorph is in darkness most of the film yet you'd probably
huff if you heard me blithely criticize the film because i couldn't see it most of the time
because you understand it matches with the film's desire to create tension and a sense of the
unknown black panther with the fact that it switches much of the perspective to the guards
who are scared of him also appears to be riding on this idea it also again plays into the notion
of escalating tension as we're building the audience's excitement at later seeing him show
off his full capabilities in a daylight setting you can counter this by saying we already saw him
you can tell there's an audio change here and an editing change because he hasn't got
visuals of him doing it he realized that his own argument has a flaw being that he said that um
they show him in darkness first because a great buildup to seeing him fight in light and it's like
we already saw him fight in light in civil war so but uh this is his counter for that assumed
argument full capabilities in a daylight setting you can counter this by saying we already saw him
fight in civil war i can counter by asking to what extent filmmakers are beholden to the
assumption audiences saw the previous work in the series and look it's a whole conversation about
how we each interpret and judge art so he's on the team of you can only interpret it as a sequel
if you interpret it as a sequel wow okay all right um it's like my favorite and new hope is
i mean you could think that uh the empire strikes back you could interpret that as a sequel to a new
hope it could be maybe if you feel that way not set in stone though there's no jesus christ these
people that's like a that's like something that's like a meme answer that people would make up but
they believe it unironically you know someone just someone just posted something in the chat that
like reflects exactly how i feel and they said my brain is sore that's exactly how my head feels i
like feel like i want to smash my face into a wall i want to sleep for like six years and interestingly
uh lonewall from the chat says predator did this they hide the threat while showing the action
clearly yeah we can follow the events just fine even though we barely see the predator i'll give
them the benefit of the doubt um and say that it is possible to have a sequel where you still build
to revealing a thing that the audience has seen before my example would be like rogue one they
clearly build up to you seeing darth vader because they know that's something you want
oh i wouldn't i don't think his point it would be inaccurate um it's just that it doesn't defend
the idea of poor lighting and it doesn't contradict what i said in the video there's so many layers
to why this is a piss pull counter yeah see him in the dark at the start i've got nothing it's
the same i know you've got nothing jack i know that's your whole video see him in the dark at
the start i've got nothing it's the same kind of vague contextless criticism as pointing out
wakonda is an advanced society with old-fashioned design elements which are true not only of many
first world nations today that's a nice counter my friend but you don't see half a building of steel
and half a building of thatched housing it's not a thing it's a really bad attempt at trying to
combine two potentially conflicting ideas within a culture i'm not saying it's impossible i'm saying
the way they did it was hilarious hey but almost all sci-fi settings based on the progress of
technology and medicine and protection in general would allow the strongest person to rule rather
than the smartest are generally looking at the best um you okay those were sirens
i'm guessing they were just finished he's turning gay wow that is that is that is hideous
oh it's gotta be your profile picture now yeah i'm i'm already on it
oh my god one day someone's gonna find this like someone who has no idea about like any of this
context is gonna find this image and ask me about it oh lord my eyes baelyn you're the best i love
you oh jesus how do i delete somebody else's pose oh i i'm curious though how he defends the
trial by combat thing i'm interested to see that let's check it out why not i remember it being
one of the weaker parts of the video well gj yeah did oh did you i did yeah okay maybe what
condoms don't look at intelligence the same way we do wow that's so fucking racist
how's that for subverting your expectations oh that's averted my expectations it's the same way
we do because iq is a pretty contentious topic even in societies it's established in and being
smart doesn't objectively make you a better leader wait maybe being smart doesn't make you
an objectively better leader what a strange statement couldn't you just flip that and say
being strong doesn't objectively make you a better leader which then highlights the issue
which we're raising is that it's a system that does not account for what is best and he's like
yeah well that's the way they do it it's like well that's my problem obviously when you're
gonna choose the dictator of your pacifist society you want to use trial by combat to find out who
is the strongest warrior who's going to be the dictator of your pacifist society especially the
the the fact that he's bringing up or being smart doesn't necessarily mean you'll be a better leader
implies that the alternative to trial by combat is like trial by a trivia quiz try trial by a leader
we used democracy like yeah like this is the only metric that they use who killed getting more votes
doesn't mean you're smarter i mean look at history ha ha wow that's racist i believe that
human being and fish can maybe wakonda separate from its technological development is an extremely
patriotic nation that heavily discourages anything to suggest a change from the established
traditions of the state if only there was criticizing them for that jesus yeah something in
the text to also that clip has no relevance to what you're talking about that is literally
tochalla saying you fucked up when you kept the secret of killmonger jack watch the movie i
remember it better than you and i haven't seen it in wow i can't even remember i'd rather not
oh he watched it in preparation for talking jay that first time oh sure yeah that's probably
i want to say two three months ago when did we remember seeing it three months ago there you go
i watched it three months ago and it was a nightmare i still remember um how excited you
said because we watched it together and i remember how excited you were when you were like
where's my favorite building you know when it was panning over the city
oh the the thatch steel building
see looks like it's rain tonight so too bad for the johnson's on the west wing
johnson's are you mean the shook weakens shook weakens on the
anything to suggest a change from the established traditions of the state
if only there was something in the text to establish i i like that i'm just gonna imagine
to charlotte's talking to him see i don't know yeah i actually don't know what he's trying to
say here well he's he's saying that i'm i'm misunderstanding that it's a part of their
culture when he's misunderstanding that i'm criticizing their culture yeah did he think
that you were being like yeah this is a great thing for society to do well i think the problem
is that he thinks that i think the excuse they're doing it therefore they're doing it is something
i missed i'm like yeah no jack i know they're doing it that's that's the premise of my argument
yeah we think it's dumb elements mauler has dinged past as objective flaws like that he refers to
them as me dinging past them do you know i hate to use this term i hate it i'm so sorry to use
this term but he's actually dog whistling to people who think that i'm like cinema sins
i'm not like cinema sins that term is basically like um he's saying something without saying it
to get the audience that would agree with him to go nod like they nod they go no
and through interpretation dog whistling sibling he used for political stuff i am trying to just
use it in its actual definition i'm not trying to make a political statement when i say dog
whistling there this is actually so this is literally the most political thing that's ever
happened and if you don't know that you're wrong somebody in chat said he looks like uh steve the
pirate uh from dodgeball oh yeah i still it's a combination of things he's a very unique man
um he can have that if that is considered a compliment suggest ways it contributes to the
film storytelling how it immediately establishes wakonda strict traditionalism as a contrast to its
technological progress my point here is pretty shallow it's part of my video yeah good job yeah
we think that's bad we you'd but i'm at least actually making one as opposed to rolling through
an entire film even the parts where sorry but every time you've accused me of that you've been
wrong so i'm just not going to take your word for it anymore you don't actually have anything to
comment on stopping for a few seconds occasionally to eye roll at something so that the viewers can
just intuit it's a bad thing what's this video i was about to say listen listen to what he just
said again but in the context that he's referring to himself about my work and listen to what he
says an entire film even the parts where i don't actually have anything to comment on
stopping for a few seconds occasionally to eye roll at something so that the viewers can just
intuit it's a bad thing he fucked what he does with my videos that is that's a him to a t
so i just the self-awareness explosion in farms rhinos why in the goddamn hell is he
farming rhinos ah jesus christ the balancing on that ding um also yeah uh
i do do we need to say anything about farming rhinos or is that covered technically already
i think we should go into it um the birth of a meme it's yeah i just i just like it's delivered
to be entertaining i could have just said it is strange that they farm rhinos next point but
instead i was like nah i'm going to make my character the delivery and the unbridled rage
get flustered at the idea that they're doing that and then these people are like this guy's
actually getting really fucking angry just because there's a rhino on screen i'm just like
oh right you're the okay i have to explain this to you in a shocking twist we get the exact same
criticism brought up again regarding why wakonda only wants there to be one black panther and it's
just man how are you showing clips of iron man and captain america while making this criticism
and not seeing a contradiction why don't the tibetan monks teach everyone the mystic arts
they're very very selective about that it's in the movie
it takes a while for dr strange to get a chance at learning it you just bring back up at this
point the part where he acts all on his high horse about saying oh oh yeah this was explained in the
text of the film yes so jack you might want to rewatch dr strange um they're protective as fuck
about all of their information because they think it's considered power that people shouldn't hold
or at least people who are trained shouldn't hold the film he was talking about there was black
panther i would say dr strange has a better explanation of why a few only a few people have
the gift than black panther does yeah and you had to explain it for starters and dr strange is
irrespective of the person's origins in any way shape or form while black panther you can the best
you can say is they don't like people outside of black panther doing tisms when you're like okay
but dr strange is just it's we'll move on to the next one why doesn't spider-man tell ozcorpo
whatever about the spider things why doesn't spider-man tell ozcorp about the radioactive spider
things this is a legitimate question he's asking guys is there anything you'd like to say
wow um wait who runs ozcorp again the bad guys okay maybe he's trying to say that at the beginning
when peter parker didn't wait which which universe is this in i guess we're going to use the mcu so
we don't have any of the answers oh yeah with the mcu i'm not as familiar with how do you
what is he gonna do i was bitten by a spider in a building um everyone should go do that because
what it did for me is amazing a radioactive spider aren't they specifically studying their
effects on humans so surely they will find that out if yeah it's we're not given the origin in
the mcu so we don't have to assume from the fact that they haven't given us that origin
what we're getting is a result of what was possible so multiple people in chat are asking
if ozcorp exists in the mcu that's a good question actually i don't even know i don't know if it's
been mentioned i imagine i don't think it's been mentioned i will imagine i imagine they'll bring
it up eventually yeah oh that's actually it's actually a question that autofills on google
um let me how ozcorp could possibly work in the mcu who bought avengers tower and spider-man home
coming um oh yeah i've heard it implied before that ozcorp uh are gonna take the avengers tower
that's a theory yeah there's a lot of there there's a lot of videos here talking about how to
introduce norman ozborne and ozcorp into the mcu and yeah so to conclude here uh i don't think
that we have an issue right now in the narrative um but even if they were that doesn't mean that
i don't agree with jack on this he just assumes that i wouldn't yeah and the thing is we i don't
think that ozcorp exists in the mcu anyway to tell currently i'd have to control f ozcorp in
all mcu scripts i guess i was just one of those instances we have no information on it so asking
the question is kind of pointless because it could literally be anything yeah we don't have so there
can be more spider-men to protect the earth maybe there's a fear there that if they don't consolidate
this strength and use it sparingly the wakandans risk a lot more so his argument's going to counter
why the wakandans don't expand outside of wakanda when my main argument was the people of wakanda
and then specifically the bodyguards of wakanda that was my biggest argument he's ignoring both
of those and he's instead addressing why wakanda wouldn't give it to the world
not necessarily even the bigger part of my argument and i i haven't even rewatched my video
powerful people with bad intentions and no easy mechanism to stop them you know how iron man has
to specifically pick peter out to give any kind of super suit and even then it's with heavy heavy
restrictions and only allowed to be used in a very specific context yeah maybe it could be a similar
kind of oh whatever dean he gives up because there's no actual citation uh you've got loads
of references for iron man and why he won't give away his suits that's in the stories wakanda doesn't
really have shittle for explaining why they don't give their bodyguards highest tech and flower power
he stops there and i'm wondering yeah go on oh he's stopping oh well he thinks the point's obvious
and he's accused me of not extrapolating what i mean by by points that's a bad thing so it's
like jack you're doing it too buddy i'm at this point as well i've seen this one so much i i
imagine you guys will agree that it is say oh this thing isn't a problem because it could also be a
problem in these other movies what oh it was the what about this thing yeah that's the one i see
the last jedi a lot oh yeah yeah well this other movie yeah well we're not talking about another
movie yeah and it's like well they're not as bad in the other movie is not relevant right now
yeah my god we're not even a quarter of the way through the film yet
now does more the stumble upon something we're about to get the first jack compliment that
like seems partially legitimate like i said eric is much nicer to me than jack is but check this
out hooray now does more the stumble upon some points i found strong in this 45 minute rant
absolutely i also found the writing in that first scene between the dad and the uncle contrived
this is followed up by a lengthy diatribe about how shuri being a prodigal genius inventor is
because well did you notice that the other prodigal genius inventors are guys jay was the
one who actually highlighted this to me because i missed it on my first watch through what do you
think he's saying when he says this shuri being a prodigal genius inventor type is apparently a
problem for her and not the other prodigal genius inventors because no don't worry mate
i'll go there because she's a woman uh i i think it's because she's black oh really um oh i think
poor jack is so sucked into the insanity of his politics he just automatically assumes
my issues with shuria because she's black really i was gonna get you see i don't i don't even know
i assumed it was i did it yeah i assumed it was an identity politics related piece of garbage but
like literally if she was 40 i would not have cared at all same here's the thing here's the thing um
if you this when he says uh when he makes his argument saying why is it a problem for shuri to
be a uh a prodigy and a an inventor uh but not these people he adds just the words not these
people like you never say that you never didn't you never say that you never specify it's a problem
for this person not for these people i mean it works both ways because he showed two white males
this is black female yeah so it could be either black or female either way jack and this is clear
in the video i just i'm sorry you've let your politics get way too far into the into the
assessment um i think it's bad because she's so young and there's no senior members even though
wakanda has had a piece for like ever since the stowed age right there's been a consistent
the clan has always uh to charlotte's clan has always been king i can't remember if that's in
the movie or not but i'm implying that there's been no problems for the science division and
the medical division and yet this 16 year old girl who is apparently the smartest person in wakanda
is the lead person for that area to the point where she's helping the king on his missions
it's a little bit ridiculous yeah i mean look at what uh spider-man did he made a terrible suit
in a thing that shoots webs and that fails all the time spider-man homecoming is full of fails
if if uh the lead scientist in wakanda was like old but a white dude you would probably have
questions why the fuck is the leading scientist in this isolationist nation
in africa fucking white that wouldn't make sense that would be an issue you know when
we watched uh infinity war last i even pointed out there's like this one shot where there's
some random white um wakandan and i was like what is he doing here well they open up their
borders wolf it makes complete sense it could um why would he be dressed to like them and armed
like them it could be just the opposite of tanning no it you can it could be a genetic
like defense genetic defect i know i mean yeah yeah yeah um he could be albino if his parents
are both black he could have like albinism he was clearly just a white guy no no he he was um
he was like um he was a white guy no he just spent a lot of time indoors he was uh starcraft pro
that makes complete sense to me yeah because what else are you gonna do in a super pacifist society
where nothing happens then make what are those memes that's that's what i would do yeah exactly
he's michael jackson made a terrible accident involving a commercial like if jack is not aware
of this um what he just did was walk down a corridor point to a room and say this room does
not exist and carries on walking and so i'm like oh that that's an existing room it's like he's
he's highlighting the issue while saying it's not an issue that he's going to discuss and it's like
you would have just cut that out if that's what your goal was but you clearly kept it in because
you wanted it said see arguably another dog whistle too but uh i don't know you know you
get into the point where it's just like you expect anything better not really nope not really
really happening here in mauler's own words just another bloody stupid detail as we reach
the 30 minute mark mauler is still just summarizing the film making occasional digs as we've already
established he doesn't understand what's happening when i summarize so um not really gonna take that
with a grain it'll take that with a giant silo of salt i think is what i'm whatever he says
regarding um summaries i can't you can't trust him he's shown himself to be an unreliable source
of information that maybe half the time aren't easily shrugged off and it begins to feel a whole
whole lot like this is just a guy digging things off the top of his head with no real thrust beyond
the fact that there it is again thrust again that downward thrust made him feel bad without this
elaboration it's no here's the great thing we didn't feel bad the only feeling here is coming
from you and your we go by facts i know that's a little bit of a difficult thing for you to grasp
since you don't live in the real world you live in a little fantasy land where you think but don't
but don't let him twist that into uh see wolf admits he doesn't have any subjectivity involved
in his videos and so when you find an example you've proven him wrong it's like no no and i clearly
do but here but not in infinity war no real yes they do what's the criticism of you literally
played the clip of when mauler said bam he just said of infinity war is only like a six from the
robot of the film miss it he said though there's no real delineation of what's the criticism of the
film versus the characters let's hear that again here but not in infinity war no real delineation
between what's the criticism of the film or the characters what is it hard for you to understand
a character criticism or do you need me to explain when i'm making a character criticism
so when i say fin is inconsistent in tfa do you need me to say this is a character criticism
surely you can yeah tell the difference by listening to the words that's what i was assuming yeah
like if it's about that was a comeback by the way just in case you needed me to explain that to you
it's like i have to kneel down like i'm talking to a child try to get on their level so i don't
feel like i'm too imposing and say if i'm talking if my criticism is about the character sweetie
so it's a character criticism as bum luxe just highlighted the characters are part of the film
that's a meaningless distinction that's true if you criticize the character and someone asks you
did the film had any issues you could say yeah this character yeah mauler thinks of as objective
flaws versus just things he personally didn't like just the challenges wait what was he criticizing
that he didn't explain shocking that's a good point that's the film don't procreate jack
is that made him feel bad i mean he without this elaboration it's hard to really get why
these contrivances matter here but not his wife's boyfriend will no real divinity war
there's nothing wrong with no one's ever said they don't shut up stop it man he can
go bad faith we do it okay that was a long simile that's an argument i actually didn't catch that
let me tell you as someone who has been dissected on efap learn from it right you won't you don't
have to agree with literally everything they say but listen to the things they're saying
as an open mind okay jay you have to you can't just tell people that you don't agree with us
and things yeah jay can you start with the indian things you broke character jay you're the worst
boss ever oh you're not my real dad i don't even believe that you are jay jay binks anymore
that fucking picture though it's amazing my god the film made choices that bailin's too good at
what he does because i'm gonna feel really bad if i like have been calling him he's one letter
away from aowans so just switch with every passing sentence between and a couple letters
away from say it is so and a couple letters away from talented why would i have eyebrows on my
nose in this picture i have two distinct eyebrows like above my nose i don't get it i think it's
supposed to be a breakthrough with the glasses connect and it may not my glasses connect with
eyebrows some of quinton's monobrow i apologize in advance bailin if i've accidentally been
misgendering you you see this is this goes to show we don't give a shit what your gender is
you could be talented either way chase face said uh apparently jack's done with watching this
because he wants to go watch uu haku show dude must have felt really embarrassed by how lazy his
video turned out to be a little bit yeah i i would be embarrassed if i made this i would be pretty
embarrassed i'd be pretty ashamed myself why these contrivances matter here but not in infinity war
the infinity war video is not presenting errors jack how many times no real delineation it is
literally spelled out literally spelled out when people are like they've clearly made a mistake
like this is why we get confused because they're just like surely that's bad faith because i make
it explicit in the clip he's referring to in that section so how could he have missed that
and what you could say is that if he actually mentioned it in this video he goes he says he's
not going to talk about errors but that's hypocritical because and then makes an argument
for why i should that would be different but he's not even referenced it it's bad criticism
just say things have people who want to hate you piece it in on their own
maybe between what's the criticism of the film or the characters what mauler thinks of as
objective flaws versus just things he personally didn't like mauler just agrees to it like the way
they frame this scene is that he has the opportunity to deny this shit and yet he gambles himself
a powerless suitless techless wakandan warrior against a professionally trained cia kill count
record breaking psychopath with a vengeance obsession directed at your bloodline what a
dumbass move you're about to hand your whole land and people to this monster because he has
the correct right this guy makes a good point it's to challenge i like this guy the fact is
mauler doesn't seem to understand tradition as being a very overt team edit the black bars off
i i know it's it's a pet peeve no get rid of them i have a choice why would you think they're
ugly get them away are you saying black isn't beautiful jay the african-american bars jay
twisting my words this is these bars this is completely unfair why would you insinuate that
i'm a racist when that's clearly not my intention anyone who does that is clearly just that's your
opinion it's pretty easy to understand disney super hero film or it's just irrelevant to him
because he doesn't frame his criticisms around notions of theme what the film may be trying to
communicate how an objective aspect of the film such as the fact that tachala lets kill monger
fire even if it might mean him gaining the throne does not an objective form make uh it does i'm
highlighting that the mother says in the scene don't as in don't accept the challenge as in you
actually have the ability to do said thing and tachala's like nah i'm gonna do it and so i'm
sitting there like tachala if you win great if you lose your entire society and the world is
going to get destroyed why risk that when you can choose no you rem and this guy's response is you
don't understand that it's a part of the theme is a theme being fucking stupid it's like a meme
it's like it's like it's not a criticism if it's related to the theme it's my argument about the
theme clashing with the narrative they address this later and they just do not understand the
argument simply because you personally wouldn't make that choice it's not about if i would make
it it's about tachala not making it humans are not logical you can't expect characters to behave
logically or else a film just couldn't exist no you guys there would be no conflict if everyone
behaved logically just as with the infinity war video mauler exposes how his video is bloated
length is a consequence only of the fact that he constantly repeats himself discusses things that
have so he showed one example of me mentioning the spear more than once and that means i constantly
repeat myself well and jack you did it nothing to do with his analysis of the work thoughtlessly
calls out as criticisms parts of said work which are perfectly in line with the narrative and logic
of that we'll just explain how that one isn't and how every fucking thing you said in this video
is like not applicable to that statement but okay cold or straight up makes up plot holes and
so he's referring to me not getting black panther's name and i don't ever call that a
plot hole i simply ask i simply state that we never find out why he's called black panther
yeah there's like a break from tradition essentially but he's like you think that's
a plot hole it's like no that didn't affect the plot at all actually
oh chase face on twitter someone added him and said anyone defending this mauler person
is embarrassing themselves for the whole world to see you guys are amazing we are amazing who's
saying that um i don't know that it's because i can only see it in discord it's from perry
ronaldo single terry jr so take that as you will i agree uh we are awesome we are grissa we're
thank you perry thank you i accept the compliment happily we are the tits i agree with that statement
too yeah i like these things i'm not defending mauler i'm just here to promote my own channel
at the end and not because it's offering him the chance of a deeper analysis once again
we get what is deep jack shallow reading in which a man on the internet angrily it's shallow
okay i get it these things in a film that may or not be bad may or may not come with an argument
as to why they're bad but certainly if you listen to the tone of his voice we know how he feels
all of that can be applied to this video and it's so much worse because at least i'm attacking a movie
and that i'm using references that are provable from the movie while you you've taken another
person's work out of context to prove something about them that's not true this is why wolf was
doing the whole subhuman thing probably it's not cool to do this to another person it's it's
actually mean it is indicative of one's character and their principle it's not just mean it's like
i don't respect you as a person if you do that i can't fuck what the fuck you dumb ass movie
it's just oh here's a long boring summary of what happens in movie and i pick out things in
this that make it bad it's really important they ride rhinos in wakonda movie loses points for that
i don't think i ever said movie loses points for that i just point out i don't do a conclusion
other than ranting that i think the movie is fucking terrible i'm pretty sure but uh
fuck we don't need to get into the rhino criticism i mean i would say when you criticize something
that is something that you consider the movie well he's implying the cinema sins thing again
arbitrary numbers adding up to something and for me i'm more just pointing out all the things that
i think are wrong or bad or inconsistent or whatever hang on i'm sorry i'm sorry did you
just say that i'm not cinema sins i'm just pointing out all the things i think are wrong
when the video series is literally called everything wrong with well i don't i don't
do i said they don't count mauler mauler i don't do numbers long man bad no please
so someone said um subhuman doesn't seem accurate because no animal or mentally handicapped person
would do something like this that literally implies that mentally handicapped people are
subhuman couldn't it couldn't it be argued medically that they'd be subhuman as in they
are i i don't want to go down this route i think i think uh digits are subhuman because they're
lower and i think they're subhuman because they live in the ground they live in the ground um
live in their hobbit holes uh well well do we can we like make an exception for peter dinklage peter
dinklage peter dinklage peter dinklage peter he was very he was very big in infinity that's true
that is very true he is he's big if you like lay down right and mauler don't go there dude
you'll lose your channel for sure yeah uh it's it's literally about how you define sub or below
or uh less than the standard you know healthy but subhuman is typically used as an insult to be like
you're below the respect of a human so i understand i take it back pointing out rags you're a doggo
listen obviously listen i choose to be down here actually so i can be uh more aware of my
surroundings secondly um i was joking about the dwarves i have many many good friends who are
dwarves and they're wonderful people my best friend is a dwarf yeah shout out to all my um
all my dwarf friends i love dwarves i love dwarves because i used to take a train that had a dwarf
now wait a minute mauler no hey dwarves take up less space on the train there's that's good to
have dwarves around i say i say more dwarves look i know dwarves dwarves are my favorite no one loves
dwarves more than me um uh i'm gonna say hideaway has pointed this out uh so far the video is mostly
about mauler's rant videos why when people having problems with mauler's critique series the actual
long videos yeah because the rage ones and the praise ones are both lower than an hour
yeah he doesn't go after what you what the example should be if he's trying to make his
point as coherently as possible um he's going after well eric is targeting the critique series
that's the interesting part we're coming back to eric in a second and he has more relevant things
to say someone said uh rags name the dwarf is with name the dwarf name the dwarf oh listen uh
no i feel like i i don't want to do that to him he's a nice guy he likes to lay low so i i don't
want to you know i don't want to really put him out there like that that's a load that's a low
blow rag it's a low joke i hate to be so short with this kind of stuff i just feel like it needs
to be said important they ride rhinos in wakonda movie loses points for that in this movie doesn't
matter if the villain's motivations are entirely inconsistent they're not can you can you justify
that yeah justify that claim go for it yeah please justify that claim i'm curious good
thing bad i really like people who are definitive how can he criticize you for saying thing bad
at this point oh man that's tough that's tough also so this is going to be a quote where um i
i'm talking to wolf about how i like it when there's references for things and you fully
explain yourself to me that's gold and obviously the contradiction would be you don't do that in
your rage and praise videos and i'd be like you're right i don't yeah that's why they're rage and
praise videos that they have their own names their own thing yep i really like people who are
definitive and they have strong evidence that shit's gold it's like yes you put in the work
instead i just go in well if you look at this over here from this angle in this way and then
look at this part in the film as well then it's pretty good right it's like hmm we can insult
maulers content all we like you can try but i don't really see that much value in just dunking
on someone like there has to be at least a bit of insight so with that in mind i'd like to bring
your attention to a certain time stamp it's 52 minutes and 20 seconds into part three of maulers
i like to remind you guys i i i'm already feeling better with eric on screen and i know
that sounds ridiculous it's just because his take is just so much less retarded than jack's is that
eric's baby photo on his uh should i say buyer's market buyer's mark buyer's mark mark market
buyer's mark i i got nothing i want to buy someone said you slot his back
everyone's referencing you will try of maulers critique of the last jedi i mentioned this part
because that's when he's done explaining the entire film in excruciating detail but you might
be wondering how does he continue talking for an hour after that and he when he's done explaining
the movie well as it turns out like that's the good part like the the first four hours was just
a massive lumbering preamble this portion starting at 52 sorry we're gonna we're gonna let that one
we've addressed him talking about that i'm gonna let that one pass eric because he's trying to
compliment me here and i appreciate it two minutes and 20 seconds into part three of maulers the last
jedi critique is truly a masterwork it's i think he's being facetious there but i actually do think
that he thinks that it's actually good stuff in that part so we can take that folks thumbs up
yay it's such a condensed buyer's market sequence of spicy cakes that it makes the first bit seem
like it's just you seem confused what to do with your hands a little bit yeah um so like he doesn't
see the value in having the bits at the beginning when i'm gonna do the summary anyway and i
understand how you reach that point but as me and i think jay were talking about at the beginning of
the stream or near it the purpose of the stuff before the summary is is evidence and there's
explanations in there too and it's it's definitely not just a summary this calling it just a summary
would be i would say incredibly bad faith because i mean even if you disagree with the points you're
making during that time there are clearly points being made like he's weeding out all the casuals
now that i've told you that you can just know i think your videos are very approachable
we to count the casuals okay the useless garbage and get to the stuff that matters and i recommend
you do because it provides a lot of insight into how mauler views his craft but also we don't have
all day so i'll give you the short version if there's one thing that can be taken away from
this it's that mauler sees airtight storytelling as the the absolute most important thing to strive
for when you're when you're making a movie if say you ever had to make a choice between logical
consistency or bolstering some other aspect of the of the work yeah see i just need you to be
more specific with that claim i'd be like when are those two things opposed to each other
instead of working together i would be i just need him you know but like i'll let him go for
that one i would say that you're not saying you're not saying don't do this do that you're
saying do both yes 100 you ever had to make a choice between logical consistency or bolstering
some other aspect of the of the work you always always always choose logical consistency
for an example of this uh if let sure you go it's the last jedi by saying that it has a strong theme
of failure and progression that would be a motif thing go back to bill george a theme
can be defined as a motif um it gets in that it gets into semantics though and i don't know if we
want to go there i'll just get down off my high horse well the problem is people will tell you
you don't know what a theme means and then you check the definition then they go that's not what
a theme means and you're like oh my god help my brain do you mean by theme argumentative misfire
because in his words the themes go against the logical consistency like like some logical
consistency had to be sacrificed in order to include it i wouldn't put it that way logical
consistency was sacrificed for the theme i would say that um the way in which they execute their
story they didn't realize that they were sending conflicting messages um the theme is made very
clear by yoda so we know what it is we have the statement failure the best teacher is or whatever
it is um and then you're like look at the events in the film and you have characters that are not
failing and we're being told that they are and then they learn lessons that put them in worse
positions and so it's just confusing um it's apparently applicable that ray failed to convert
kylo to the light side it's like what do you mean she just went there she for some reason
thought that that he was a good guy and then it turns out he was a neutral guy
which is better than bad but then her refusing to hang out with him
makes him evil again it's so like what are you trying to say film what do i say to this
well most if not all plot lines and character developments we just went over for the last four
hours don't make sense they weren't supported by the previous films nor were they well executed
they simply happened the best example being pose he didn't fail throughout the movie when
you actually consider his actions finn only failed because the writer decided that a bb unit saw his
team nazi things like this forced me to come to the conclusion that yes why did he just throw me
in there because i said forced forced diversity get it oh okay oh yeah most video was good and
yours was shit eric i don't know why i don't know why you want to remind people about that but all
right and that yes ryan johnson wanted this theme and he shoehorned events to make it happen but
this makes the writing even worse he put a theme over the characters over the plot to force the
characters around the theme to make you think about it on your own personal i guess i did kind
of say that is i just need to qualify what i what i say there in case anybody's not getting it it's
it's just that um the idea of theme comes above everything else and makes the movie perfect even
if nothing makes sense in relation to the theme when themes are especially the nature of themes
can be so broad and poorly defined and they can pretty much be kind of just summoned into
existence by the way you want to interpret things like anything could be the theme or anything might
not be because it's just so ethereal in a way um i don't particularly hold themes myself to be
like up there in terms of a movie's importance because of that um i just think it's a really low
sort of bar uh i like talking about themes once once all the things that are great about the movie
have sort of been made clear and then the theme is like the icing on the cake in terms of look at
how all this connects when you really step back look at the lesson that the film is trying to tell
us through all of these events while other people would be like as long as there's a good theme the
movie was good it's icing not cake it's think you can have a good theme and like a logically
coherent plot those two things are exclusive to appear more intellectual although he seems to
think that a theme is just noticing that a thing happens a lot which is an odd way of looking at
it like like there's a part in the video where he just completely shoots down the entire idea of
interpreting themes by by picking a word from a so it's the my point is to shoot down the entire
idea it's that um the theme is so arbitrary in the last jedi in terms of how you apply it you can
apply anything to it and that's not the case for every movie it's not the case for every story but
the last jedi people are desperate to apply themes to it in order to defend it and i try to prove
that and i would say if that's not what he thinks themes are tell us what themes are yeah it'd be
nice to know what he considers to be themes if he's yeah see you gotta keep them ethereal and
floaty and out there but i mean if like if i was doing a video response to somebody now and they
said you are this or you are not that this is not that and i would be like okay well you're gonna
have to tell me what you mean then or just at least explain where i've where i've misstepped
maybe i'm on point but i've missed a certain detail of interpreting themes by by picking a
word from a hat uh for for his example it was resurrection and then pointing out all the times
that some someone or something resurrects during the film like aha this is equally arbitrary
therefore themes are bullshit yeah nearly there see you so close equally arbitrary therefore is
bullshit in this movie but themes in general i love themes and they can be measured mechanically
and emotionally for what it does for you personally um that you get an example would
just be like uh some guy who's like heavy into how capitalism is destroying the world whatever
there's a movie where a guy is wearing two boots and he's and they're very worn and he goes so
that's tying into the theme because it's worn workman shoes is to try and imply that the working
man is kind of beaten down by the one percent having benefited off it while he can't even afford
new shoes and then you find out that that character is actually not working and that those
shoes are ones that he just casually put on they belong to his dad or something and you're like
well this doesn't really really apply what you just said is more interpretation more subjective
it's got no mechanical reference and that's how i look at themes and i consider it both important
you tell me that you've drawn something out of a text that i don't even think is there mechanically
it doesn't matter if it's a subjective argument if you're talking about what it means to you
because i'm not i can't take that away from you and i wouldn't want to
that is my take
kylo allows the dark side in him to falter and resurrect part of the light poe resurrects the
part of him that wants to maintain the cause rather than trying to be a hero leah is resurrected by
the force i don't know i like the the whole failure thing wasn't just people pointing out
that characters fail like i i thought a pretty big part of it was that kylo ren doesn't learn
from his mistakes like like the mistakes that he made in the force awakens and i think you have to
try really hard to staple that into the theme because kylo is so confusing when you try and
look at him consistently in terms of his choices he's not on a he's not on a path he's zigzagging
all around who knows what he'll be film again our our thing you're not allowed to vote for kylo
in our thing because he's going to be the most inconsistent pretty much as a guarantee we have
to boot him out just continues to fail while everyone else just moves on i don't know it's
worth talking about though so um i talk about it in the video a lot yeah and he said it's with
talking about though i agree with you eric and i feel like i did oh yeah i'm already
sure how you came to that conclusion but okay anyways uh the same argument is used to to discredit
people who say that the visual splendor of the last jedi is a selling point uh the term style
over substance is used next up would be the phrase style over substance this is of course in reference
to the idea that you put your eye candy before your writing films like speed racer enter the void
transformers 300 and avatar are also used as examples in this sort of genre if you can call
it that some of those examples are far worse than others but you get the point the last jedi has a
strong pattern of style over substance let's go through a few so you know what i'm talking about
phasma disappears and then reappears in smoke making no sense but it looks imposing the
hyperspace jump makes no sense in universe but it looks incredible the destruction of the bridge on
the radis makes no sense but it looks impactful the bomber ships make no sense but they reference
world war two bombers which looks reference people um this is in my summary so you if you
were disagreed with any of my takes on these all of my evidence and and breakdown is in the plot
summary part for all of these yep that is the purpose of it yeah east of those things just
talked about individually yeah striking phasma falling into a sudden pit of fiery death makes
no sense but it looks intense and furthermore he i i don't understand how he can watch that and
come to the conclusion that you're saying the visuals don't matter like you spoiled it jay
but no you're right uh so yeah point being writing is sacrificed in favor of creating uh
engaging visuals or i don't know well-composed impactful imagery i guess you could have good
writing and striking imagery don't sacrifice either of those things to add to the other
yeah you can you can just try for both that uh and along with all this uh he claims that
stuff like visual splendor doesn't even matter it doesn't matter compared to the when talking
about writing all right and i think he's about to show a clip of this just listen to what i say
because it's just gonna age and it takes money to generate imagine what the end result of this film
would have been without the money behind it to fund the actors the set pieces and the cgi these
things don't matter in the grand scheme not even the assets poached from star wars as a franchise
they do not matter to the writing the effects will age the shots will age every choice will age
writing and storytelling is timeless i agree he says doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things
it doesn't matter compared to the writing so yeah the if i i don't disagree that there's room to
interpret that i'm saying that our visuals don't matter i think that's just a poor take
when i've said that and that the more likely take would be that i'm saying that these things don't
matter to writing quality which is intrinsic in that writing is writing and those things are
visuals but visuals do matter in films i would never have said that visuals do not matter i think
that's a pretty stupid thing to say this is honestly just a bewildering way of looking at
film like like i know there's a lot of online media critics who really value logical consistency
perhaps a little too much but too much i haven't seen anyone else say that it is like straight up
the only thing that can ever make a film good and everything else is just because i haven't said it
either you've still not heard anyone say it it's a distraction you know you can just read a book
right like how can visuals be neutral in a visual medium are they are they are they neutral or do
they not matter what about books with pictures in them eric also i was just about to say that
medium when you read them i um i kind i mostly agree with his counter argument to the strawman
he created down strawman you go you were a bad argument and it's an especially strange critique
to level at star wars of all things which is this as far as i can tell is a series that is mostly
known for its imagery that's why i like them no no no imagery and visuals aren't necessarily
the same thing at all um i would say it's more known for its characters um or known everywhere
complicated question but i would say that star wars is is fucking amazing because of
great characters and an incredible use of special effects for its time it's i'd say it's iconic just
for like everything in it isn't it pretty much kind of a few parts of the mute the soundtrack
of star wars is incredibly iconic the the world building is like for now it is amazing world
building the characters visually and other considered you know incredibly iconic characters
i know i phrase that really well you know i i i agree with you but um first and foremost of what
i think makes the that makes it strong would be the characters but i mean what is it best known
for it's a complicated question darth vader you could immediately recognize from just a silhouette
and like a single line of his dialogue he is iconic for basically everything or just his breathing
you don't need to have him talking off he's iconic like with the things he says the sounds he makes
and the way he looks neutral essentially trifecta someone said what about comics um so every medium
has different standards it's every craft right comic book writing would be different compared
to script writing even though i think they would share a lot of similar things considering even
then i mean i've read some really great comics with really great writing um yeah berserk i mean
i know it's a whatever manga like it's still a comic his counter is like so it's great
his counters like i'm looking at movies as if they're just books or something and i'm just
like no there would be different standards but he's this is the thing i can see how he got here
and it sucks that he got here because i think that he was like seconds away from understanding what
i was actually saying well in a visual medium and it's an especially strange critique to level at
star wars of all things which as far as i can tell is a series that is mostly known for its imagery
that's why i like yeah i can't say it's mostly known for its imagery i'll be like it's mostly
known for darth vader and luke skywalker probably at the peak i'd say the most i collect
things from star wars as far as i'm as far as like you know my understanding would be
i am your father that is i don't know what do you guys think of
that alone true oh yeah that's like one of the most recognizable musical compositions ever
so yeah yeah it complicated but i mean we'll let him go for that
like i saw them without any nostalgic goggles and i thought they were great like i i had a really
good time with with the imagery i thought it looked and felt really nice it had an ambience to it and
it also had huge ass emotional set pieces and i loved it all and that's also why i didn't really
like the force awakens because you like the last jedi in themes the cold the last jedi does have
striking imagery and huge emotional set pieces you can't say it doesn't have yeah we've i think
i've spoken to someone else about this i was like to say it has an emotional set piece i'd be like
sure if that is your standard then i can understand why you would feel that way about the film yeah
whether or not it's a strong emotional set piece or a week one that's another conversation i mean
they i guess they tried the things again that you have to for some people the fact that there
are writing errors won't crack from the emotion they feel when they're watching the scene
i don't personally empathize with that but clearly there are people
clearly there are people clearly there are people okay clearly there are people
you like the force away it's like cut out there is that yeah we know what you said though
i agree some people will clap at anything comparison it felt very standard it didn't
it didn't have beyond beyonds and in turn that's why i liked the last jedi because
there are some shots in that movie that are gonna be remembered alongside like genuine question
doesn't this feel a little bit more like he's actually trying to share how he feels as opposed
to manipulate something yes and i'm like for a moment that's why i'm like more pulled into
this because i'm like you're not trying to fuck with me thank you you just actually just talking
for a bit and it's not to say that eric hasn't fucked up previously because he absolutely has
it's just that this is so refreshing in this video this portion it's just like oh thank christ
does um what does um what does jack think about the last jedi does he like it probably dude
because yeah the fact he said probably i'm thinking
is there a way that eric could have come out and said that he thought it was terrible and awful
now into the the double sunset in a new hope like there there's just so much emotional content in
some of the events that happen in that movie some of the the images that are sewn on screen
and that that might explain why i didn't mind so much that the bombers were designed in practically
but here's the skinny mauler has heard all of this in a critique of the last jedi part three
mauler implies that that argument and arguments like it are an attempt to shield the film from
criticism like he makes up a hypothetical episode nine where like just would you say the way he made
it there was attempting to shield the film from criticism no he was making subjective arguments
yeah he he said he acknowledged that this could be considered a flaw
and then goes on to say but i liked it because i don't prioritize things like that
personally i don't know if he knows that that's fine with me yeah but we we have encountered
people and we constantly do who make nonsensical arguments in order to defend the film
like there are people who will say that same thing and then go see the film isn't
fucking bad and you're like well no you just stitch that on the end like you can still
objectively qualify loads of things in the movie that are flawed you can't just say
but i don't care about those and then say the movie is good because of that
a hypothetical episode nine where like everything is like completely off the wall like all all the
threads are dropped it's hilarious honestly all right it's time once and for all to destroy this
argument what if the ninth episode of the series opens with luke saying lol i'm sleepy i guess and
he jumps wearing only a nappy into space he chops every last death star star destroyer etc in half
and kicks the supremacy he then stands on the sun and says kylo you must return to the jedi
because they are actually okay and really cool and so kylo does would that be something you
consider bad because if you did if you said to me that this is terrible writing do you know what
i'd say back to you you don't search for logic in a star wars movie a movie full of laser weapons
noisy explosions in space and little muppets running around you need to remember that this
is a movie first with visual it's practically an argument from principle it's like pretty much yeah
well it's it's it's trying to find people's limits yeah once they admit yeah once there's that line
that's established well now they have to qualify the line and they can't it's not based on principle
it's based on feeling exactly that's the point metaphor and not a documentary about real things
happening in space and really this just speaks to maulers utter narrow-minded are you gonna answer
the question you're not even gonna answer the question are you eric you call me narrow-minded
that counts rags you're not even gonna answer the question are you eric and really this just speaks
to maulers utter narrow-mindedness when it comes to art like the only way a film can be good or
bad is based on how airtight the script is and if you apply that there are other ways to to judge a
film then he says you just don't have standards at all oh that's a good straw man like come on eric
wow oof why did he just answer the question eric if it was my video i would have answered maulers
question so like i've yours everyone has a standard that they use called this is the subjective one
where you go this movie is something i like and i based that on how much i liked it that's all
that is a standard um so for me to say you don't have any standards if you tell me i just i don't
know i just kind of like the movie and i based that on how much i enjoyed it i'd be like yeah
that's fine but if you say i don't know i think the movie is uh very well crafted in terms of a
film because i liked it i'd be like that's a non-sequencer someone said georgie's trying to
kill himself to escape this living hell yeah but it's okay to think that a movie is well crafted
because you like it but argument you can assume that because you like something it was probably
well made like that's a reasonable assumption uh you can assume it but if you state it it's
different but you can yeah you shouldn't estate state that definitively based on that evidence
but if you can't show it i think it was probably
like if i were to say oh he's addressing us if i was to mention like a movie in passing
and say uh just oh uh i think it was probably quite good objective because i well i really
liked it so i assume that means it's good and then i wasn't trying to make any real points
about it i would say that would be fine i will agree with arco that georgie has the best
arguments in this video consistently the best arguments wolf and rags too oh that jumped ahead
a little bit oh oh and rags ways to to judge a film way friend way friend he says you just
don't have standards at all hi mauler and probably wolf and rags too if you're watching didn't say
hi to jay then i have a couple of uh film recommendations that i'd like to give you
because oh god oh boy i'd like to have a discussion about these things i do not want to
do it exclusively in reference to the last jedi i hope you understand yeah you can't win that one
mate he said he's not exclusively implying that he would be willing to so just on the docket is
a film called funny games uh any of you guys seen this no no what do you think i've seen it
and uh i thought it was all right but if he wants me to see it again to have like a coherent thing
to say about it i guess i could watch it again but um um i've got nothing to say about it
definitively right now i just what i remember is that it's like neighbors when two people are moving
in i think tune out to like capture them and put the like arrest them into their house and then
weird things happen um but i that's my memory cut completely i'd have to watch the film again
assure to to get the american version like usually remakes are worse but this is a
director remaking his own work and actually improving on it in a lot of ways second is a
film called sorry to bother you came out um i've not seen that i've never heard of it never heard
of it last year now and the last film i'd like you to check out is called under the skin
have you guys seen that i've never heard of it nope i've seen it and i really like it um
but i can guess why he's chosen it it could be argued as an arthouse film
or an artsy film uh that's all you need but i got a couple artsy films for eric well i was
gonna say that does artsy mean cannot be quantified objectively in which i would disagree
vehemently i have some very objective arguments for why under the skin is good
yeah no these are just recommendations you don't know why he's doing this but my assumption is
that he's gonna enjoy trying to listen to me break these films down objectively perhaps i'm
not sure but under the skin is more than possible and i quite like that movie it's a it's creepy and
strange but it made sense yes i am in fact giving you homework but um if you want to you can you can
give us some film recommendations too if you like we've already been doing homework for the past seven
hours um i would like to give you loads of film recommendations teeth black panther um catwoman
2004 uh the emoji movie uh um teeth is genuinely the best movie ever made a bardemic and bardemic
too um watch them out of order because it makes more sense that way right um what are some more
amazing movies for them to watch i actually got three unironic examples um pan's labyrinth the
gray and the road three of my favorite movies ever i liked the gray and i liked the road i was
gonna say i like all three of them but uh um i mean legitimately if he wants movie recommendations
from me the problem is like i i need to know the criteria am i just recommending a film i like
or am i recommending a film that's supposed to assist in some form of an argument
um full the dark world yeah full the dark
think are underrated that we haven't seen that would help your points
underrated that i think they may not have seen that would help my points
the last jedi is all i need to prove my points the post and saying spirited away in the chat
is objectively correct um because the points it's a theoretical statement right so if my points
work with the last jedi the idea is that they work within how movies function all that all the
standards so there is no movie it can't apply to and you might be like well i i just don't see how
that could apply to and then names a movie and i'd be like so you need me to watch that movie and
then have a conversation with you of how it would be broken down i guess and it's like i don't know
that it's do you know what i mean like it's it's like why would it be fair for me to do that for
someone just on the the assumption that they just want to understand how the system works
when i'm trying to imply that you should be able to grasp it from just how broken down the last
jedi so i don't know that it would ever be something you would grasp you know i mean
it's kind of like a isn't that a useless endeavor for me um i'm happy to talk about movies with
responsibilities something like that i'm happy to discuss movies with with eric but um the
criteria there that i need to pick one that'll prove my points whatever i'm like every movie
works so i i'll just pick i'll watch yours i suppose but this is this is assuming they even
want to talk to us which is a questionable thing considering i don't understand sorry just i was
going to say considering um how this video is gone like how dreadful this is and how we felt about it
so i don't know what's going to happen oh jay i need to ask something um no no no yes they should
watch do you not do you not agree with me that they should watch they should watch what
well no the problem is that they think it would be good because they have terrible opinions on
everything um jay i need to ask you something how in the hell have you seen spirited away
but you haven't seen literally anything else um because it's one of my uh friends favorite
childhood films and she recommended it to me adam you've you've seen spirited away but you haven't
seen stand by me the shausing redemption degree he needs to see um gladiator the last samurai you
know i think this book cost is missing is more lists of films i haven't seen i think that um
yeah should i should i pull up the the rest of movies that i have so that i can ask you warren
eric okay the point is eric you should watch god's not dead that's the one that it that is the one
that's the one it's the only movie you need honestly it'll it'll do stuff for your magic spirit
all right um so if i come on to east i'm going to turns out oh oh oh oh sorry let's let's make
sure we get the full quote here okay if i come on to efap and it turns out you haven't seen any
of these uh i'm just gonna step right the fuck all right then you have to watch the grade the
road in pairs under rifle i'm also gonna step out of rags is there i'm also gonna step out of rags
is there that's what he said um well as you're aware that they've now agreed so you could be
here and if you're silent and we're not taking that either yeah it's fucking retarded um tree
rags like a human being please and you could be like you don't do that for us like why would we
yeah we we absolutely after this video why would we have any inclination to yeah so the the standards
will be uh you me and wolf will be the primary people talking and rags will cut it when he feels
he wishes to but it's not like if you want it to be that it's you're addressing me and wolf
specifically then rags can be here and rags can cut in if he feels like he has something relevant
to say like that that would be uh would you guys be okay with that i mean i'll be here and speak
when i have something to say but that's i know this is ridiculous but rags will speak when he
wants to speak if that's if that's unacceptable i don't know what to tell you yeah um then you
need to grow up is what you need to do why would you treat rags as a human being when he literally
that's true and the reason i self-identify is that it's because um i am one down on every level
including physical please please don't humanize rags don't humanize me how fucking dare you dare
you um but yeah i will make the barking meme noises i still i will because it's still kind
of liked his section so much more than jack's because it's just he was saying that's not what
we said and we still did that because he's got another section coming uh just for clarification
speaking of that that section yeah it's it's coming up on an hour and a half since we said
an hour ago we're gonna keep going or i'm gonna i want to nail this in one stream but i don't
expect you guys to to stay um obviously that would be applicable to jay as well because i got up
and i hopped on the stream so i need to eat and such i'll tell you i honestly have a headache
after all of this it's all good uh what i will do is put out some feelers to see who can
act as replacements i think we'll have at least another hour to go on this bring in fring daddy
g if i um oh i'll go ahead and i'll just mute myself because when i'm done i can hop back in
i just i can't i need to eat i gotta get something in me yeah maybe i'll do that too i really just
need to eat and like stand up walk around because i i pretty much woke up and it's a nice toasty
three degrees outside i can maybe stick my bald head in the snow and maybe that'll looks like it
will be death's bullshit and smud boy potentially which are the two that came on together before
oh chase face is offering as well so that's three potential fill-ins um well i will i'll
hop i'll leave the call i'll still be in the room though so you could always message me here
okay doggy and do you want to do this i'll just beat myself i was going to say the thing is if we
have a potential two or three people join it's going to stack up the visual gotcha okay are you
saying that visuals are more important than um the actual content yeah the content of our character
yeah that's not i don't consider you people are you a structuralist is that what you are
my god mauler and it is martin luther king jr day how dare you no it's not not for me it's
gone now well it is in america the only country so it's only let me see what the time is
i i can't believe it is fucking 8 52 pm that's incorrect factually 9 52 for me oh boy 52
you shut up counted uh j what's your plans um well i literally had to um and this may sound
confusing uh set an alarm to get up early for this stream despite the fact in my time zone it started
at 8 pm i can understand that uh but what what is your longevity uh expected to be i can essentially
go as long as i need to since all right um i literally don't need to sleep for a good 10 hours
which means it would be me j i i can't i don't want it to be five people so it's chase smud or
death bullshit um how do i choose pull names out of a hat chat chat if you want uh mud boy wait
chase is one uh smud boys two and death bullshit is three chat can vote and we'll go by what j
thinks is there the the most by what j thinks is there the most i've seen a lot of jareds
that's that's just a lot of numbers man that is hard to figure out isn't it
type j for jared i saw a lot of twos you can make a straw i'm just doing control
left to see what that is the most you know i can't do a straw poll yeah it'll take just
a second to set one up that's the most threes i feel so inhumane doing this
but i mean i can't think of any fairer way to choose we've got a negative
jay for jared jay
wait jay's already here georgie
all right um my offer is they can come on efap but only if georgie is there
georgie can be their third one uh fine
okay so this is gonna work right yeah okay all right the poll is going well vote on the
poll wolf god why do i have to vote put stroll poll in description not chat that's a clever
idea person who said that yeah because it's scrolling too fast for me to go there it is
now in description once you scroll up once you scroll up it doesn't scroll anymore yeah you'll
be fine once you do that and it'll only be for a moment so everybody vote on who you want in you
can it's multiple choice i'm gonna vote for all three and then look at the results okay uh jay
before i leave um swiss army man no blades of glory no hancock yes i robot yes napoleon dynamite
no have you not are there any will smith films you haven't seen wanted to stop there are a lot
of will smith films what about night crawler oh damn i mean i haven't i definitely haven't seen
after earth that's that's okay that's okay that's racist uh galaxy quest yes the way way back no
school of rock actually jane have you seen um have you seen tombstone no no okay i like it too
king's men the secret service i have seen both of them phantom boys no robin hood men in tights no
the perfect storm no cinderella man no things in new york no all right have you lips no jaws no
the ring no chindler's list no the future wait what really that wasn't like required i mean i
watched that bike in high school apparently no i had to watch the dead poet society i went to high
school okay uh the fugitive uh no hook no cast away no you've already asked me that one guys
the vote right so smud boy is absolutely in the lead but the other two are like neck and neck
like literally one vote between them oh boy it's close they're both at 30 percent okay oh okay what
you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to say like all right in 20 seconds voting's done
and then you just pause it and i'll just take a screenshot and then i'll let you know all right
all right that's fair enough so we're close i'm gonna post it one more time we are closing the
voting in 2019 put the results on the screen 17 all right j red dawn 15 no the truman show
no that's really happening i've seen all three i think seven six seven five five oh no
pan's labyrinth no that's way all right we have all right we have here are the results
shut your pie hole all right so number one is smud boy with 184 votes number two uh
no i don't have anything to beat uh well i mean i'm looking at it right now no it's a das
bullshit is number two and he only won he has 150 he has 146 votes and he only won by four votes
yeah and those two keep telling so um the constellation prize will be i'll totally
bring uh chase face on to an efap at some point in the future because i feel bad that he came so close
but i just don't want it to be too stacked up he's just sitting in bed right now like oh he's
crying i really wanted to come on tonight all right let me ask one more before i guess i didn't
get a really old jay one last one before i go all right my friend is asking me if you have seen
no country for old men i have
wait did it did you bring oh never mind i was about to say it's like you brought everybody after all
well see this is the thing was ragged a tonaled loke go we'll have four yeah we'll have four and
it's just that if we bring in chase as well uh we'll have five and i don't know does everyone
think that could work i haven't heard his expectations bring a bit we did five once
and it was because doomcork was only available for a small amount of time but things got confused
in scheduling we had five people for like an hour i think right so i think we should bring on
um no bullshit no no it's my audio okay by the way i know we had a problem earlier
uh there's a load of people as a joke you know i can't think of anyone else that is the link
that you may require oh thank you well i shall be leaving very well sir so so much and i i wanted
to say thanks to rags but he's gone already so i'll just have to keep him in later but uh thanks
for hanging out for um you know six hours and 41 minutes yeah so jay is gonna beat that record the
second you leave hey i was done that eight hour stream with um that's true that's true also before
the stream started i was i always say before you so uh yeah there's all these different tiebreaker
things hey hey i'm the better friend he calls me for movies like three times a week well
i don't have to come back to that i just said well exactly all right see ya doodles bye
um jay you're the overseer could we survive five people or not uh sure i don't see why not
okay that's not an overseer thing to say you have to be definitive um yeah no god damn it yes
like my guilt is getting to me i kind of want chase to be it out just because the fact that
he came so close that it's just about to bring him in like that was a nail biter dude i'm gonna
bring his ass in we can't we can survive it but uh if it goes wrong then we can't okay so just
just to be clear i'm all for this unless it goes badly unless it goes bad that makes sense i mean
we had this number during the major league thing we did but it was a little bit chaotic like there
was a bit of like everyone wants to speak on something it's tough with five boys hey you
are very quiet hello i'm probably not gonna say a ton because i'm not um intimately acquainted
with mauler's original video but i will be here for psycho analysis can you boost the microphone
of his videos yeah you're very soft is this better that's slightly better find a way to fix it way
too quiet because you're on 200 for me weird uh if i do it anymore i'll kind of be peaking is that
okay go back down like just just slowly turn it while talking and then i'll tell you when to start
i'm talking and i'm going a little bit down i'm going down incrementally and right there
that should be okay cool i'll just change it if i need to and then yeah so that's fine that's the
link we are 39 minutes into this debauchery what do you think of it uh people who've just arrived
so uh i guess go from left to right uh uh dash posture what do you think well um i'm actually
surprised you're still doing it because um i was watching it like i came in late so i had to just
kind of watch it as it was going and i was pretty sure by the time uh i was done that it was going
to be over but we're still here it's pretty awesome um but anyway on the subject of the
actual videos yeah this is frustrating this is very frustrating and i love to be a part of this
all right smud you next up oh jeez i wanted to be in this from the start i actually messaged you
as soon as i woke up i was like i gotta get into this because i saw you guys just streaming i was
gonna be thursday i was like what are you doing i actually missed that pm for a while you saw it
as of looking for extra guests because i never look at pm once i've started streaming um it's
my it's my era uh but you you've been watching since it started have you oh well i took a break
for uh for dinner and whatnot but uh jeez it was i was like it was driving me nuts i was rewatching
it uh last night we were talking about it yesterday too i was like i'm gonna do a video
about this and i kept listening to it's like no this is really specific to you and rags i'm like
oh if i do this i'm gonna be like kind of defending you you don't need me to defend you you're totally
fine doing it yourself and it would just be a waste really so that's why i want to go i've just been
i've just been bickering with uh what was the name jack on twitter because the way he
goes about his very smug points is just kind of embarrassing he was really he was really digging
in his feet and i was just trying to ask him okay why don't you want rags to be there and he's like
because it wouldn't be even and i said okay well are you saying that they wouldn't be respectful
of you and that they would just like be a bunch of hype men as he put it and start like ragging on
you no pun intended and uh he just he just kept kind of repeating himself and i was just like well
i don't really think it's a good look to just keep taking like these cheap immature pot shots on
twitter like well how does that make you look good just makes you look really fucking unreasonable
and plus the people who aren't watching they're probably missing a lot of context and wondering
what the hell he's talking about well yeah this this stream is going to be four as a as a definitive
take and you might be like oh they're more goes taking a 15 minute video into however long this
ends up being i'll just be like well yeah people keep people keep falling back on the lazy oh his
response video is going to be five hours like that's as easy as he would say that's not an argument
yeah and it's like so um yeah that's also wrong because it's going to be like 12
well i think anyone who talks to him directly like anyone who uses objective observations and
talks about objectivity versus subjectivity we're going to give him every reasonable doubt
whatever he wants to say and we're going to evaluate his facts and that's it for anyone
would do that rags would do that i would do that anyone here would yeah exactly i'm not
interested in attacking him or anything like that i just think if you make a lazy video that
misrepresents somebody i think it's fair to dispute that so if he's watching and he remembers me as
the annoying cunt from twitter jack i don't hate you i just think you're really fucking annoying
and uh i wanted to uh i i really do want him to come on and talk to you guys because i i
genuinely think it would be a very enlightening exchange but he seems uh hell bent on refusing uh
you know doing anything he can to avoid that for some reason which i suspect is because he
thinks maybe he'll be humiliated on a live stream well this entire video this this entire video is
one of the most aggravating things to watch like we saw another two-hour video that someone made
which the arguments were so bad and in the whole title of this video is
it's long and not deep like that's the exact example of something that's long and just not
even worthwhile to watch so this kind of video is is like part truth and part misconstruing and
out of context you just it's very aggravating that mauler whomever made this long video to explain
things in detail and to not derive any sort of meaning out of that is like are you are you
listening to those words and then when they literally cut video clips out of context you're
like okay now i know you're not listening to his words you're just saying this for the sake of
arguments and that's not how you should form an argument that's not how you should talk to someone
it's like if i was mauler i'd be kind of like jesus this has got to be addressed and
boy that's why i got the references ahead of time and it seems to have really dispelled it
like showing the clips as they were originally and then showing what they came away with
is telling as fuck and also you know you get to the point where it's really hard to say like
so this was just uh an accident right they made a mistake it's like hmm
i don't know i have to be generous to say it but i mean uh not out of the realm of possibility
they had an editor if they had a third opinion or i don't know someone else who was like hey who
actually liked your your stuff and said and there were some guys in the comments who said hey this
isn't a good this is probably the best attempt i'm like yeah i guess it is but it's still pretty
bad so um i mean it's a pity that wolf and rags on you to answer this question but it's just like
is this better or worse than tro's video and i probably be like i think it's worse
um there's more misrepresentations in this than there is in the tro one because tro is uh banking
on the space in rags's responses to interpret so it's like he's actually going from the text and
then using it while quinton makes a couple of blatantly bad takes on something but then one
would be an outright lie while here like it feels to me that jack has done his very best to find any
way of uh cherry picking and straw manning like it's like he's classically trained in that
yeah if he had actual facts that you pointed that were false and he would attack you on that
that'd be great that's that'd be a great example because you're not perfect there are flaws for
sure but i didn't see any of those and you even admitted to the some of them it's like well why
didn't you just attack those that would be totally fine and instead we have just so much dismissal
not to derail us but uh jack was accusing people uh who were you know basically calling him a coward
for just sort of tucking his tail between his legs and doing everything he could to not to join you
in any sort of discussion he he said those people were uh he's like is this one of the strawmen i
heard so much about and i was just like oh you're so smug you're so smug how is that anyway strawman
i don't get that well i don't know what can we assume about his take on one of strawman even is
i don't know really clearly doesn't understand a lot about him well even with the other gentleman
they weren't defining their terms again and they keep talking about how important themes are and
you're like what is a theme please tell us so we can understand you and they never got that it's as
if it's universally assumed this nebulous term is just everyone knows the first definition is true
what is it you know defining terms uh this is there's like two angles to it it's like um to
ignore the terms that i've defined and then to also not even give your own defined terms it's
like they they do both of those things regularly so it makes it really hard to understand what
they're even trying to say yeah and i was i was uh in the comment section of the original video
still typing i think you actually have to comment in one of the the comment chains to at least three
other people and they're trying to tell me about formal logic and informal logic and they're trying
to define logic it's like listen he uses logic do you understand the various flavors of logic because
i don't i just know the one flavor and it's the one that a follows b and b follows c and therefore
a is equal to or you know basic stuff i was like well i teach logic it's like i don't care he's not
trying to teach someone logic he's trying to explain what happens in a movie and why there's
a problem that's all he's doing and it was just like this bizarre back and forth and then someone
was talking about the climate change i'm like okay this is going into politics now it's bizarre
these people who are trying to attack us or attack you specifically about objectivity when it's just
yeah it's a tool we use it's very effective and we use it and we have facts and we look at the facts
and we talk about it in favor of clarity just so that we get to the point but when you argue a
thing and i'm like is that just how you feel or is that an actual thing like that is an actual
thing like okay cool i can actually check it yep exactly and they don't seem to enjoy that more
than the visual experience like yep that's certainly part of the experience of watching
a movie or reading a book there's there are visuals there are descriptions it's not the
be all it's certainly a part but there's also dialogue there's there's narration there's all
sorts of other things make sure the video is actually working for everybody is that can you
see eric right now yes we can yep beautiful um weirdly the chat for me like it's working for
stream because it's embedded but um the chat for me is broken i can't actually see it's not working
right now i'm waiting for it to update and my live dashboard on the other monitor is just gone
like it's a white screen on the browser neither of these things are reassuring but the fact that the
stream is still functioning and everyone can hear you guys and the video still works i guess i can
carry on and just hope that it fixes itself while we uh continue yeah chat's working and everything
um but don't worry about super chats folks they will still be um i can still access them even
if the live dashboard fucks up and we'll just do every one of them at the end and obviously
anybody who wants to stay is welcome to stay for any of that and um as for descriptions for
channels that are people that are here i'll sort that all out at the very least in post but if i
can i'll update the description i think when i updated with the straw poll it like killed
the live dashboard i don't know why um so yes uh that was there was the just the additional
section for america oh sorry i must have skipped ahead to yeah okay if i come on to
efap and it turns out you haven't seen any of these uh i'm just gonna step right the fuck back out
sorry i'm also gonna step out of rags is there oh shit this is a recent review of 2018's predator
reboot is incidentally marked with all the same issues we've seen in the last jedi review the
black panther review and every other extended critique a tedious summary wavering between
superficial digs at things you don't like because it makes you sigh and say what the fuck and
literally just saying things that happen with no real reason to remark on it and i'm not fucking
kidding here guys she ends up shooting herself with the tranquilizer in her own fucking foot
god really a strong female character making mistakes can't have that in today's holy wood
what a take right oh yes it's a woman that's your only reason oh i hate just like the concept of
women an actual woman yeah never mind going line by line oh my god what were you thinking
so uh for context because i don't need to show these i can just tell you guys at this point
because the other references have shown how much of a i was gonna say liar let's just say how much
of an incompetent person jack is um so they need the there's so much about the film the predator
that is fucking awful in terms of storytelling and um obviously they need the girl to be knocked out
so that the team of heroes that we're with can take her back and like when she wakes up she's
like what the fuck why am i here and then they break it down then she works with them so they
needed to get her out of the action situation but on board with them that's your writing problem
so you go how do we do this like we'll get her unconscious and then they'll pick her up to help
her and then she's with them how do we do that well we could have her like you know fall off the
van that she's currently on and hit her head vaguely and just knock around she's like no no
she's holding a tranq gun have her shoot herself in the foot it's like what you know like she just
shoots herself with the fuck i don't know you know like so she's sitting on the van with her legs in
front of her trying to aim at something and they hit like a rock with the car and the van
and she accidentally shoots herself wow okay yeah we'll go with that that was a fifth and so
my rage videos are supposed to be me and like utter disbelief at some of these things and you
be like you didn't explain why that's bad and i'm like oh well yeah you got me i i just thought that
was stupid intrinsically but like sure and the irony is that he's been doing it throughout this
whole video with a lot of quotes and clips of mine but he like doesn't appreciate it when i do
it about a movie as opposed to him doing it about my character it's like cool the standards are very
interesting um but yeah and then his take that how dare a woman make a mistake yeah and it's
weird too because it's all like he's immediately equated it to a strong female character doing
it as if that's supposed to be normal like are women supposed to fuck up that hard and you expect
that i think he's just trying to be tongue in cheek because i literally sorry go ahead i
literally don't understand what kind of point he's trying to make because it seems to go against
previous points he's been making if he is suggesting that you think she should be stronger than this
as a female character if that's the insinuation like i find myself thinking about this statement
a lot with his video but i'm like what do you think you're saying jack because i i'm not getting
that's basically the question i would have from at this point what does he think he said
what point does he just think he made give it to me again in between the rage and the praise
videos as you go line by line that's the same thing everything else is like well you're going
to be gushing about one thing you're going to be hating on something so that's a pretty clear
distinction he's not i don't think he actually made that distinction between your type as you
described throughout the the show he just wasn't catching on to the fact that oh he's really praising
something here or in this video it's all hated or it's all criticism it's like okay
can can is there a different style he's using perhaps is he there's a reason why he's doing that
either way let's continue with the tranquilizer in her own fucking foot god really a strong female
character making mistakes can't have that in today's Hollywood with all that said i think i'm
getting it now writing this with Eric combing through the archives i get why Mueller and those
who follow him have convinced themselves that this is the same as a real in-depth nitty-gritty
critique real in-depth nitty-gritty what the hell do any of those mean does he want like dramatic
structure like what does he want what is the definition what uh why don't you write a book
like a an essay and like publish it like what does he want well i mean he's he's telling me
that there are no such things like an objective standard that i can adhere to or have presented
and then he's like i am not adhering to standards that he he apparently has that i a nebulous to
it's just like god this is just so confusing to follow but sure is that the first time you've
taken that out this video well the problem is that um it's all horrible and i don't know which i'm
trying to think of which part the thing was with the notepad what i've just put down is in
has already been from other videos the real thing in-depth and nitty-gritty i guess i can keep but
i've already planned to put real into the thing it's just funny to keep referring to the thing
you're describing as real it's not i've never done it before it's just that come on jack real
and in-depth what is a real critique what does that even mean yeah what would he define as one
what do you think you're saying jack clearly he's saying this in cont and in uh you know
he's saying it in a very sarcastic way so it's like okay so he's he's is he suggesting that
it's fake so what do you suggest is real and um yeah real first by the way they're just
placeholders because he can't actually figure out what he's actually trying to tell me
like does he mean inaccurate that's a different word altogether you know yeah
you have an area unexamined in your mind and that's where the combination of conscious and
unconscious impulses that make you feel certain ways about certain things lie you've built a
system a conc there's no such thing as being aware of your unconscious mind and that's called the
subconscious if you want to be correct but yes but you wouldn't be aware of your unconscious
during that time you'd be asleep in in beta mode or whatever i'm assuming he's making the argument
here that what i'm referring to as objective criticism is just a part of my mind that i'm not
quite aware of uh you use both you see that's bizarre i don't i would never want to guesstimate
his mental state or yours but if you listen to any of your videos whether it's the rage or the
praise videos you do use objective observation and then you have a lot of emotion behind it so
it's not really half and half but there is a difference pretty clear jack just said he's
still up for chat with maula but nothing other than a one-on-one at this stage
at least he's conceding that i personally i would do it just to see how it goes down because i feel
like or to just be he he has to leave at one point then i bring on wolf and rags again well
here's here's the thing he's not going to fucking he's not going to work with you unless you
strictly adhere to his rules so that's pretty much the only way you're going to get him to talk to
you is by you know letting him throw his tantrum and just believe you know just going by his terms
and i would say just do it just this once it'll clearly show that you're like the bigger person
because i i understand not throwing rags out that makes perfect sense
but if he's going to concede that he's at least willing to have a conversation i would be interested
in hearing it it's just so weird what is the animosity towards rags it looked like he was going
to elaborate on that and then they just because he just wanted it to be two on two he wanted to be
him and eric i i don't know he will he once eric once said after he completed his video on wolf
that uh he's happy to talk to wolf about it personally but not me and rags and i asked him
why and he said because me and rags are two of the most toxic youtubers on the platform
i was like okay interesting but if he's willing to talk to me now
sorry it comes down to i don't really want him at my birthday party kind of yeah um obviously
because we've addressed this now is this like um the whole he called me a schoolyard insult
i have this the reaction of it's a schoolyard insult i'm confused why you're taking it so
seriously if it's you would you agree that it's something that shouldn't even matter um and i've
seen you be very very polite uh everyone that disagrees with you whenever they come on your
you know in your show like i know you'd be just an h bomber guy we're talking about rags though
uh from what rags is like i don't know what would you describe him as rough or brutal
rough i get it sure um none of these are qualities that i actually have any problem
with with rags i like how uh clear he is with the person he has an issue with
uh but there's an element that you might find him too intimidating to want to um
i don't know be engaged with maybe they don't provide us a reason to assume one
jack has also just said your crowd led to the mass harassment of star wars crew members
okay yeah that's not true jack uh orchestrated many abuse campaigns in several countries
including australia and germany if i say it it's just true that's how this works
repeat the lie enough right also i want to say i like rags a lot i think he's really cool i always
enjoy listening to him and i left this comment on his newest video about uh fall at 76 but holy
shit somebody give him more royalty free music to use because after an hour of that one lo-fi
hip-hop song being used i wanted to shoot myself in the mouth again i really like rags that was
miserable same one point like the music just ended like for the last like 45 minutes or so
there was like nothing left there was no music at all i would take no music over that same song
for an hour i do agree that as i do switch it up a little bit how can you say that this is the kind
of thing that results in the harassment the casting crew when there's literally a part of
the dream where you tell people not to harass him it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter um i've
had other people address this before they'd be like maul what do you say the fact that
your critiques would give people the sense that they are right to go after the cast and crew members
whether or not you intended that i'm like what do you want me to say to that and they're like
i want you to admit that you're responsible for cast and crew harassment and i'm like i'm not
there's this weird like i don't know if it's like an ideology thing but like if you read a book on
fishing and then decide to kill your parents it's like you can't blame the fishing book it's sort
of a guilt by association thing honestly it's a very weak argument like your your followers
are adults they're going to do what they want i disagreed with jack on twitter about some stuff
and maybe i got a little bit nasty at first just seeing the way that he was approaching things
really irked me because it was very insincere and very immature but you know i i tried my best not
to attack him or anything like that i just think that people conflate the two very frequently
um but yeah anyway let's kick on you give us everything you got jack create coherent system
that has made it easier for you to identify what things specifically you don't like mostly
somewhere along the way you convinced yourself that these things being objectively a part of
the text arguably makes your feelings on them also objective no arguably arguably even if
everything he said here was coherent and true um all i have to do to prove him wrong is give him
a film that i think is objectively bad that i enjoy uh therefore meaning my feelings uh
contradictive to the what i would consider the objective assessment because his his revelation
here for me is to be like mauler don't you understand all of your feelings on films happen
just so happen to line up with all your objective assessments on films and i'd be like
but they don't though then he's like oh what i'm like yeah so like the room i think it's
fucking awful but i really enjoy it batman robin's fucking awful but i really enjoy it um
there there are movies like infinity war i think it's really flawed but i think
like i enjoy it to a level that's far beyond how flawed i consider it to be objectively
do you do zero i'm going oh yeah for sure is the rest of this video is just going to be a
10 minutes of pseudo psycho analysis followed by a three-minute patron crawl i'm going to be pissed
a little bit i'm just gonna hop out for a minute i'm gonna go grab a snack and then
i'll just meet myself for like probably 10 minutes all good man these things being objectively a
part of the text arguably makes your feelings on them also objective and now you've decided
without a lick of real study into how most of this stuff could or should be measured
that you're simply on another level to other critics you've seen the code now you can spread
the word by giving really long summaries of things and going this good this bad this good this bad
hell if you do it enough it's just like a real analysis fucking nailed it shit nails wow that's
that's exactly what you do this is the cuntiest misrepresentation i've ever heard of your content
this good this bad long man bad he keeps long man bad that's that's the meme that's a new one
right there we're using that i really like it long man how do you measure things
like objectively like you just you just look at it it's just there it's right in front of your
face that's it that's all we're doing what's weird is he keeps referring to the unbridled
rages where it's just like quick and mostly entertaining and you you flat out said like
it's not facts i just realized um we're at seven hours nine minutes and there's no way we're
finishing within an hour i don't think especially super chest we read out apparently youtube
streaming has a limit of eight hours oh start another well i was gonna say i can start another
but that's like we're not stopping for anyone should i do you think i should stop and start
now so it's chunkier on the other end of it or yeah i would say so i think that makes sense
so uh yeah this is gonna be a two-part two-part two-part efap and we will just i'll take the
break for about five minutes i suppose to make sure they separate out um and then we will return
and i can just redo the thumbnail because it'll be a different cast that makes enough sense and we
will address the rest of this video and then all the super chats after doing sort of conclusion
it's gonna be great too far too farter let's go so yes uh goodbye chat we will return give us
five to ten minutes donate to my patreon
