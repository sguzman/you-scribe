It's always reassuring that before it even says that the broadcast is completed the chat
starts coming in.
It's like, Oh, we just got a really, really good chat chat is from the future.
Late man bad.
I, I am outraged that I am the late one quote unquote, I shan't throw anyone under the
proverbial bus, but metal was the late one.
Wait, I was the first one in the call.
I was the first in the call.
How dare you know your mother started the call.
No, you can't.
No, no, mom.
She cannot help you now.
Oh, yes, hello, Chad.
How do you do?
Hello.
Hello.
I get this chat on screen before everyone reads.
I just realized there's a pop out chat for YouTube.
That's way better.
Yes.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Pop out.
Are we live though?
Do we have people?
We got people.
We got people.
We got people.
Oh my God.
Hello, everyone.
Hello, everybody.
Everyone.
That chat is on the screen looking fine, looking sexy.
So let's see.
Yeah.
Yep.
Everything's looking good.
Thumbnails.
Thumbnails up and up.
Yes, everything's fine.
We can just discuss things now.
How is life, Frank?
Life is going well.
Life's going well.
Things are great.
Everything's magical.
All's good.
All's right in the world.
Fun to view it.
Oh, here.
I'm having a great time.
I'm having fun.
I'm having fun.
We're going to cover some videos.
Talk about talking about Joker.
How's life, Mel?
Good.
Good.
Don't lie to me.
Okay.
Okay.
Never mind then.
I cannot lie to you.
And welcome our guest for episode 70, Mr. Literature Devil.
How do you do, sir?
I'm doing fine.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for having me.
Appreciate it.
I messaged you a long time ago about availability, which I've done with a lot of people and
a lot of those people are like, so, you know, a year ago when you said, like, shut up.
I'm kidding.
We were supposed to have an additional guest, but they are either running late or not running
at all.
We shall, we shall see about that, you know, just in case anyone else ends up coming on.
But for now, it is just us four and we'll be talking about what's that, what's that
film about a clown or whatever you guys heard about that?
Batman?
No, Batman.
Batman versus clown starring Jack Nicholson, starring Danny DeVito, starring Danny DeVito
as clown.
Men who stare at clowns is a weird film.
It's an underappreciated film project that he did before he was a man we know him as
today.
Yeah, we we got Mr. Ralph, the movie maker, made a video on Joker.
And apparently it's it's real, like it's not a joke.
And I know how that sounds like.
Oh, very funny.
It's like, no, seriously, like a lot of people were like, it's a joke.
And so me and Rags were like, oh, OK, you check out the video and there's there's a
hint of it.
Like, we'll go over this.
Like, there's there's some stuff in there like, oh, this must be a joke.
But apparently it's real.
Ralph has stood by it.
And that's fine.
There'll be plenty of opinions to go over and it's going to be entertaining.
But you know, in the time that we were waiting to discover whether or not this was 100 percent
a realism, we did our our movie homework.
Did we not Rags?
We did do our movie homework.
We did.
We spent many hours with our homework.
We watched some movies.
We watched we watched all the movies that people say that the Joker is just a rip off
of.
I guess.
Do you want to go through them?
We start with Taxi Driver.
Right.
Yeah, we started off with Taxi Driver.
Wouldn't all that good?
It was it was kind of, I guess, I mean, definitely not definitely one of the weaker ones we watched.
It was certainly my least favorite of all the ones we watched.
Didn't think it was all that great.
We should probably try and do it.
I mean, we've got time.
We could do a bit of detail if you want.
So yeah.
Oh, I thought the pacing was really bad.
I thought that there were a bunch of redundant scenes that simply weren't necessary or didn't
serve much of a purpose.
The writing was really clunky and a lot of parts.
I think the protagonist's motivations were very, very lacking.
He didn't even seem like a real person.
In fact, they just did really didn't really didn't care for it.
I'm going to piss off so many people.
No, I know it's funny.
That's all like.
So my issues with Taxi Driver, I think it drags at parts and that I really don't like
Travis Bickle.
And I know that that's not as like, like, who cares if you like when I was like, oh,
well, I mean, I had anything with him.
I guess.
Yeah.
What I'm what I guess I'm referring to is strictly my my engagement with the the story
of being that I I struggle to empathize this situation because he's kind of an ass and
a bit of an idiot as well.
Like you might you might be like, how does this not apply to Joker?
It's like, oh, I guess we have to get into all of these these little interesting tidbits
tidbits.
But his I guess the film is about him trying to find motivation as in to do he doesn't
know what he wants to do specifically.
He wants to do something and bouncing between lots of different things because the representation
of what it's like to be a man a man with with plenty of drive, but nowhere to I guess direct
it.
And so, like, there's the influence, there's the approach with the nightlife, the he describes
the world as like scum.
I guess he's referring to pimps and the I guess there's some I don't even I can't remember
specifically what he says that prostitutes seem sexual and drug related.
He's got.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And he wants Palatine to be the one to to clean it up until I guess because this is
the thing is there's lots of bits that I guess you have to watch some video essays to be
clearer on.
But that didn't seem to work out for us.
And so we watch them and they just weren't really they weren't really well reasoned.
But it's just we the way that it describes why he does the thing that he does and the
way that it tries to elaborate on his motivations is really poor to the point where I was I
was really wondering in a way that I never had to do with Joker.
I was wondering why is he doing any of this?
This seems to be in fact counter to what you would expect him to do or what he seems like
he would do.
Just not.
Yeah, I might say I guess I take a softer stance to you, though.
I actually think it's pretty well made.
I just don't like it that much.
Well, it's well made in the sense that.
Well, you talked about like shots and cinematography and execution of everything or.
Well, even even he is a character being this this this essentially a dare I say creature
that's just looking to find something to work with.
He's bouncing between lots of different ideas.
There's this shaky ground in terms of understanding exactly what drives into each position.
But like, you know, looking at even discussions and reviews, people argue to this day about
exactly why he does everything he does in that movie.
Story here, I quite find I find the idea that he was looking to.
Commit to what could be considered like a terrorist type plan with with pound time being
redirected into.
Attacking that the pimps being considered a hugely heroic act by a general audience when
it wasn't necessarily exactly what would have happened had he been successful with pound
time is quite an interesting, I guess, look at the situation of how different things can
happen and the implication being that he's like a ticking time bomb and that this is
only going to happen again because he's he's so lost in terms of what he's supposed to
do with his life.
I don't know. There's there's there's elements to it that I do find interesting and performances
the as as put lots of different direct directorial elements.
I just my issue is such a difficulty in connecting with Travis Bickle.
I just don't like him. I'm sorry. He's an ass.
Yeah, really, really tough to grasp his thought process and why he does the things he does.
Not terrible.
It's also I just I just thought someone said you're not supposed to like him.
How many video assets did we watch where they said he was relatable?
He's relatable, understandable and the end him.
Us liking him is what like drives us.
They would argue that liking him is a big part of why the film is well written, is that it makes a horrible
piece and likable or something.
I was just like, oh, I think at least two of the video essays that we watched said pretty much that
you're supposed to really connect with him.
He was so empathetic and you could just level with him.
It's like you could see yourself in his shoes.
But if that was the case, they failed miserably.
He didn't even like a human being very blank, distant.
He had no real he didn't seem like a human being.
And I think they were trying to translate that through a lot of his dialogues.
Well, he struggles to maintain a lot of conversations in a especially with the girl in the coffee shop with even
with Palentine, he's blank for a lot of it until the end part.
Yeah, Palentine seems to be sort of like giving him some looks like you're a weirdo.
But sure, that sort of thing.
Even when he's with the other cabbies, he's just there like he couldn't communicate very well.
He didn't seem to have any interests, film, music, literature.
There was just nothing that he just didn't.
He just seemed empty, you know, almost like he was representative of something instead of a character, a person.
Yeah, out of all of the protags of all of the films we watched, he would be my my least understandable and likable for me.
Oh, I couldn't. I didn't like him at all.
There was nothing to like about him.
There was nothing to grasp onto, nothing to relate to him with, really.
But well, I was just going to say, because Mel, you've seen it as well.
What's it? Do you have any thoughts about Taxi Driver?
Well, it's been a while now that I watched it.
That's why I actually asked yesterday if I want to, if I should rewatch it.
Now I kind of feel bad that I didn't.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't think it's super good as well.
It's like I'm happy I watched it just for comparison, but it's nothing I would watch ever again, to be honest.
Yeah, I wouldn't.
Doesn't he have like this this
romantic thing going on with the girl and the
whatever they do, the the political stuff?
Yeah, yeah, he does.
And that's just miserably when he tries to get her into like a porn cinema.
Yeah. Like, oh, yeah.
Which is like clearly not not right, right.
Minds. I think it's supposed to just be a representation of how his brain works,
because at first he's like, she's a normal people.
She's an angel. No one can touch her.
Yay. And then the second that it goes wrong with her, he's like, she's like all the rest.
Yeah, exactly.
So it's more like it's that one is more of an incel movie than the Joker.
Are they about the same?
I would say I guess Taxi Driver would be by default
because I don't even see how Joker is in any way.
It's quite clear with how Joker is an incel movie.
It's about a guy.
Oh, got it.
I just find it funny that incel movie should be a genre like, oh, yeah,
shit on Netflix and all this required is male protagonist
that we don't see have sex at any point.
Oh, sweet.
Crazy and violent, too.
Yes. Diehard incel movie.
He doesn't have sex in the movie.
OK, psychological thriller, action thriller, incel thriller.
There we go. That's what we want to see.
Incel thriller.
So which which was next?
Is it falling down?
Falling down was the one that we watch next, and I enjoyed it much more.
I don't even know what much that one is.
So the falling down is about
the main main character has.
Let's just say you.
I'm going to describe this and you'll be like, oh,
I can see how this is considered related to Joker.
So it's character who's lost his job.
His mother is well, I was about to say overbearing,
but I guess we don't get to know a lot about that, but lives with his mother.
His mother is an overbearing.
I would say that it's kind of the opposite.
And it seems to be afraid of him.
She seemed the mother seemed to be afraid of him.
Like she knew that he was prone to just snapping.
She displayed to the detectives, to the police officers there.
She displayed a real sense of fear that they were there.
A lot of apprehension when they went into his room, she said,
you know, don't tell him I let you in here and all that sort of stuff.
So she clearly was had had a had a level of fear about him.
He sort of dominated that.
So what a chat said in cell doesn't mean what you think it means.
Well, it's like involuntary cell of it.
I'm joking that all you need to do to be labeled an in cell movie now
is to have a male character who's not having sex at the time of seeing them
in the movie, that seems to be all that, you know, but but maybe there's more to it
because because the effect that he imagines a girlfriend and Joker,
that's enough to be like, see itself.
It's like, OK, OK. All right. All right.
And someone said I have a bad take on joke, a taxi driver.
I'm just like, I'm not really bothered.
Nothing I said was untrue. Neither of us.
Yeah, neither of us.
I mean, we could back up what we said.
I watched it.
I paid a lot of attention.
Kind of feel like my time was wasted.
We even watched three guides to the movie.
Yeah. And we've been awkward because they got a couple of facts wrong
several times, but hey, like we had to correct the video essays about them
because they were just objectively making wrong statements about it.
I just didn't my chalk.
Just didn't didn't like it.
But I know I could tell when I watched it.
Yep, I can see why this is one of the sacred cows.
But oh, well, that's that's the one thing that I recognize, much like
the Godzilla fan base or certain certain other events of a history
to criticize taxi drivers.
You're not allowed to do that, but we don't really care.
Like we'll just happily move on.
We're just like, oh, well, that was that.
Falling Down doesn't have that kind of like, like defensive shield.
As far as I know, it's especially because it's a Joel Schumacher film,
which he's nowhere near as respected as Scorsese.
But I prefer falling down.
I actually very much understood everything pretty much definitively.
And you can tell that there's a lot in that movie that's littered
into trying to just represent everyday life for the,
I guess, living the American dream, quote unquote.
But the I think I think it could work with
American beauty as another film of just being like,
it's supposed to be working, but it's not that sort of thing.
And just all of the the issues you'll discover over time
in your lives that can be related to the one that I just I just really like
was the because they're all good, I think, to a degree.
But the the construction workers, just the immediate
like you guys are wasting time and you waste time
because you need to waste time to get better contracts in future.
If you take longer and need more money to do X, Y and Z,
then they'll give you more in future or maintain the same.
And so all of this is just bullshit.
And you're making everybody late and you're cutting off good roads.
He just has an RPG or bazooka or whatever.
And he just there's a lot of obviously he's reckless as hell.
But the movie ramps up with every scenario
starting out quite calmly with traffic.
Yeah, it starts off with traffic.
Very relatable moves over towards overpriced items
in a little supermarket, a little corner store.
Very, very relatable stuff.
And then it just goes up and up and up.
He's certainly a lot more empathetic,
certainly a lot more relatable than Travis Bickle is.
And we'll see.
I think that a lot of people would consider the difference between those two
as ones a film, the other ones more of an art film.
Taxi Driver is more of a much higher tier of movie.
It's much more respected.
Falling Down is much more of a casual movie
that has a lot of casual traits, I suppose.
But I have been seeing a lot of
strong feelings for falling down.
A lot of people seem to like it, which is interesting.
I've just seen the character before.
I just Google it really quickly.
I've definitely seen that
character somewhere before.
I mean, it's a it's a nice, it's a tragic little story.
I think I think what brings it all together is the when he looks
at his tapes of himself with his family and how he can see himself
being overtaken by temper that's brought on.
The implication is that it's brought on by all of the little things
in life, everything, just getting to him slowly and that
he uses the small amounts of money that he has to support his family
to buy things and provide for them.
And if they if they aren't enjoying it or using it,
it's making him more and more frustrated because that's how
everything's supposed to work, that sort of thing.
And so you could just, I don't know, understand his frustration.
And you get a B plot of of understanding the cop
that takes him down the whole time as well.
Yeah, they mesh really well together.
I I thought that the the the cop and
the protagonist, I thought they I thought both their stories
kind of running parallel was done really well and both well acted.
And you're glad that things kind of turn out the way that they do.
And wraps everything is wrapped up fairly neatly.
But the dude in the the the the
was the store called the the type of store.
The the Nazi, the Nazi dude.
Oh, like army surplus.
That was the one. Yeah, he was he was a bit weird.
Yeah, kind of kind of weird, kind of a weirdo guy.
But yeah, he did all get sorted out.
So there was that one then then
King of Comedies after that, right?
After that, we watched King of Comedy, which I liked quite a bit.
I really like King of Comedy.
I guess to be simplified, King of Comedy is about a an aspiring comedian
who idolizes a talk show host
and he's trying to find any way he can to break out.
And I don't know who lived the dream of being a successful comedian.
And the film sort of he tries a lot in the film,
leading ultimately up to kidnapping, said the host.
And the movie starts off with with him
really wanting to willing to start off the bottom sort of.
He starts off the bottom.
He's wants to get into the show business with his name.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry Lewis. Yeah, Jerry Lewis.
Well, in real life, in the film is Jerry Langford, I think.
Yeah, Jerry Langford, that's it.
And then he tries to get in with him, tries to get he gets obsessive.
And you get to see Jerry Langford's his lament about being famous.
He's always being troubled and assaulted and all that good stuff.
But the thing is, he doesn't.
The main character does get what he wants in the end.
His his kidnapping play works.
After that, he he writes a book, gets a million dollars.
It's it's kind of the opposite with the kind of like a dark version
or the inverse version of your traditional American dream
where you how you work, you we work hard and you work diligently.
And then you achieve your dreams.
He just kind of skipped to the top and committed a crime,
lazily committed a crime and then got rewarded with everything he wanted.
I find that interesting movie.
One of the most subversive parts of that movie is the fact that his set
isn't too bad, like the jokes he actually delivers once he gets on there.
It's like, oh, pretty good.
Yeah, you expect it to be terrible and horrible and cringy and awful.
But the jokes are actually pretty good.
He's he kills it on stage.
Everyone laughs. Everyone loves him.
And I thought that was going to turn out to be one of those
those elaborate fantasies he has.
But as opposed to Arthur Fleck, he actually is in control of his fantasies.
He knows when he's doing them.
So it turned out to be actually real, which was interesting.
I did not see that one coming.
That one actually successfully severed my expectations.
I didn't expect it either.
It caught me off guard.
I was like, oh, wow.
And then when we watched it again, it was the when we watched it today.
That was the second time I'd seen it.
So all of that stuff is recontextualized and we picked up a lot of, you know,
how the dialogue was very interesting now that we knew that, you know,
it was on his head and stuff like that.
It it it owes itself to a second viewing that I think is really well written.
Oh, I recommend it.
And because they built up the entire movie that he's going to be this.
He's this guy who thinks he's a big shot.
The very first thing we see him say
or one of the first things we see him say is that I know I'm dynamite.
I know I'm really good.
And, you know, we we have the same vision of him
as probably the comedian character, the Jerry character.
And that, oh, yeah, he just thinks he's good.
He's not really that good. He's an amateur.
He's just starting out.
He needs to start at the bottom, work at the comedy clubs.
And then he turns in his video tape or not video tape, but his tape of his set.
And they said, yeah, you got some good things in there, but it's polishing.
So obviously, by the very end, by the time he gets on the stage,
it's you're you're kind of set and ready to hear his cringy jokes.
But he kills it. He's really good.
And it's he succeeds.
It's worth mentioning, though, that with that film and Taxi Driver and Joker,
there's still discussion to this day, despite what the creators say.
About each film that whether or not the endings are all real or not.
And now Taxi Driver,
I believe the producer Robert De Niro and Scorsese have all said it's real,
but people still say that it's a it's a fantasy at the end because he actually
died or that he's actually in jail and that he sees himself as the hero.
And that's why he's imagining it for Joker.
It's it's the Joker.
It's take any selection of the movie and it could be real, could be not.
The whole thing could be real, could be not like a lot of people running with that.
And then with King of Comedy, it's that he never
I guess he's like he may never have left jail and that he was never successful.
And that there are there are visual cues to imply that he may very well
still be in jail or that it is real.
It's it's very it's you know, it's interesting to talk about
in terms of what the references may or may not show.
But I don't I don't find it useful to just be like, was it all a dream?
I don't know. Moving on.
You're like, OK, I personally dislike that whole it was all a dream.
I prefer it to be to be real if I can if it can be argued that the whole thing was real.
But within the case of of Putton, I think that is his name.
He has keep forgetting his name.
But the the main character, Putton, he is he we get to see him.
He has a very vivid imagination.
He has a very vivid imagination.
He has very vivid fantasies.
And we get to see him are kind of playing one out as if
he and the comedian character, the Jerry character, were friends and colleagues.
And he gets so into it that he kind of disregards real life.
So it could be argued on that note that the very end, all of that,
all of his success, his million dollar book deal, his him having his own
comedy set and people introducing him and people loving him in his red suit.
That's that could be yet another elaborate fantasy that is actually foreshadowed
in the beginning of the movie.
So it could be argued that it's real.
It could be argued that it's not real.
It's what could be plausible.
And I would say that of the three, the most ambiguous ending,
like if you were going to say of all the three, if the three endings were a dream
or a hallucination or whatever, I think King of Comedy is the one you could most
justify with it. Yeah.
You're a taxi driver.
I don't think you really could much at all for Joker.
I don't think you could either, especially when it pulls away from his perspective
to Thomas and Thomas, his wife, the Waynes getting killed.
Yeah, he I don't think he would.
He certainly wouldn't imagine her getting killed.
He wouldn't want that.
We see him sparing people who are nice to him.
That's kind of his whole deal.
He has a system, his structure.
Now, but with King of Comedy, you're like, oh, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe this is
just I like the I think it's it could happen.
I think that if someone managed to bother their way onto a thing with like
kidnapping or blackmail away or whatever, that if they had a good enough set
that they'd have enough fans to pull them back into the spotlight.
OK. Possible.
And yeah, Rupa Kupkin is his name and Kupkin's name, Rupa Kupkin.
That's it. They pronounce it wrong throughout the film.
It's a good running joke.
Rupa Kupkin is here, Rupa Kupkin, yeah.
And Pipkin and stuff like that is like one thing I really liked about his
character, Rupert Pumpkins character, was that he'd never changed his demeanor,
really, but he went from a guy you saw as a normal enthusiastic guy who was really
energetic, really passionate about his his chosen path of comedy, being a comedian
like the like Jerry.
And without him changing his demeanor, he goes from a guy you might see
as just endearingly enthusiastic, endearingly passionate to someone who is
insane by the time he does the kidnapping portion of it.
He's the part that really like sells the up in has
problems to me is when because I think one of the first illusions we see
is like reasons to imagine that it might actually be happening,
but it's a bit confusing.
But then once you discover it's like, oh, none of these are happening,
like they're very vivid.
And I think that so the first.
So him getting in the car with him, that is, I understand, supposed to be real.
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
That's the interaction that he uses with his obsessive mind
to base everything else on.
He hangs on to it.
And it essentially is the the spark that starts everything
becoming just worse and worse.
And you get the one where he's like talking to him about how he should come
to his house and stuff, and then he actually turns up there with it
with a girl who's who's not in all the delusions.
So she's like, wait, what?
Yeah, it's cool.
You're friends with this very famous person.
And all of a sudden, no, he's not really.
They're calling the cops.
And he's like, you know, you're just like all the rest.
You're a terrible person immediately turns on him instead of him being like a hero.
Um, yeah.
And that's when it gets cranked up to kidnapping, which.
Is she carries out with like, like a literature devil said,
his demeanor doesn't really change for the whole thing.
He has this very cool, collected kind of aloofness.
He it's almost just like, well, I guess the next step is kidnapping.
And he is very logical, kind of.
He's sure that he's good.
So he just needs his break.
That's that's all this is.
He's he's just certain that as long as he gets people to listen to his jokes,
give him a chance that he'll be successful.
And it turns out he was.
And I think the fact that his routine that's shown at the end being so good,
it kind of indicates him in a way where you feel like, OK,
Rupert has he actually is good.
And maybe that's part of it that really frustrates him.
Like he he has an act of all these guys.
He really does have an understanding of good comedy.
And that's one of the reasons why he feels so frustrated,
why he feels like he needs to go to these extreme lengths
because he knows in his head that my stuff really is good.
He's not just being denied for the for the black.
It is simultaneously a bit of a crazy person as in for what we see.
He's like, yeah, it's a bit crazy as well.
That's what mixes it.
Yeah, no, it's why I do like that movie quite a bit.
Some very interesting idea to the whole film focused around
just a character who wants to be a successful TV host like.
And I think when I'd first seen it, I didn't expect him to freaking kidnap him.
I was like, whoa, no, yeah, because he seems kind of meek.
You know, he doesn't seem like he doesn't seem too confrontational,
at least not to that degree.
But he never comes across as malicious.
If anything comes across as desperate.
And he doesn't want to hurt anybody.
He just really feels like this is the the last option for him
to see his dream happen.
And then you were never really there.
That was the the other one.
That was the other one.
Yeah, I say that's probably the most art film out of the four, actually.
If we're going to get that genre as ill defined as it is.
Yeah, so that's a movie about an ex veteran
who takes what you could call like wet work jobs to try and rescue.
Slash, it's complicated because we don't know exactly, but we see him.
The job that we see in the film is he's trying to rescue a little girl
from being like essentially sex trafficked, I think.
And, you know, throughout the film, you discover more and more of his
his past that brought him to where he is more about himself.
And there's a bit of a subversion
in terms of there's like a final fight, but it doesn't end the way you'd expect.
Because the the girl in question, I don't know how much I should say.
I don't know how many people have seen it, but.
The reason why it's relevant is it's a film with Joaquin Phoenix
with mental illness, a mental illness, and he lives with his mother like that
is the the connective issue to Joker, I imagine.
But again, I don't know if we've specified this yet,
but these films are all extremely different from Joker.
Yeah. Which would you say is the closest to Joker?
Um. It's not.
This is the thing, I suppose you can pull pieces out of all of them.
Yeah, there's pieces in all of them.
I would say that the king of comedy is the closest to Joker,
but that's not saying a lot because it's not to say that's very different.
There are several, several parallels between team comedy
and the story of our Arthur Flick and the Joker.
I mean, the Rupert Pumpkin lives.
I mean, he kind of he lives with his mom.
It's very clear.
He goes that he has these elaborate fantasies.
He wants to actually.
Is it clear that he really lives with his mom?
Well, he hears her voice.
We don't ever actually hear her voice.
He might. And you know, there is that
there is a fact that he made that joke during his set.
That, you know, he's been dead for nine years.
So she might be dead in his mind.
She might be an illusion.
But his mother is a factor in there like a
she's somewhere in his mind somewhere.
So there's the mother factor that she's still with him.
And then there is a fact that he wants to.
He has an obsession over a talk show host,
stand up comedian sort of character.
But their motivations are different.
Their goals are different.
But I could see a lot of parallels between the two characters
and their two characters journeys.
Yeah, I think there's the closest.
It's closest there. Yeah.
But man, are they different, though?
Like very good.
First of all, just just go as far as being like jokers
clearly on a a more murderous path.
Let's put it that way, because the conclusion for both characters
is dramatic, dramatically different.
The world they're living in is dramatically different.
The motivation is both similar and different,
as in both aspiring comedians.
But that is and that stays
Rupert's motivation and conclusion with the film.
But but jokers evolves.
So I think Rupert Pumpkins, his goal, his entire goal
is to become famous so that all the dreams you see him have can come true.
He wants he has a very, very vivid imagination.
We can see vividly all the things he wants to happen.
He wants to become famous.
He wants all the people who disliked him or wronged him
to just come back and apologize, to acknowledge to him
that they were wrong for doubting him to marry the woman of his dreams.
All the good stuff. Joker, Arthur Fleck, on the other hand,
he's not really looking for fame specifically.
He is looking for meaning in his life, some sort of identity.
And that plays into the main themes of the Joker movie.
Yeah. And I get.
Well, I was going to say, I didn't mean to skip over.
You were never really there. But that is
I just I don't know.
It feels like out of the out of the four that we've got over,
that's probably what the people haven't seen the most.
And so I just I just figure that it's probably better not to say
to put a beat on.
It's a it's rather non-linear.
And the interesting thing that I found was that it was almost recommended.
Right. By several people.
But if you look at the reviews for it, that that film has been quite
beaten, let's say, like people like it, people are very unhappy like it.
Yeah. I didn't dislike it, though.
No, I didn't dislike it.
I was actually quite hooked for a while, too. Yeah.
And Joaquin does does fantastically in it.
Or trying this because a lot of the film is very focused on on abuse
and what it does to a person.
It's very clear in the protagonist and the
the the girl in question, the girl attempted to be saved.
Again, I'm just trying to avoid going any further than that.
But it was check it out, people.
It's going to it's going to pop up from what I know,
because these are the films that are all referenced by Ralph.
Be instead, we can we can talk more about them as we get there.
Also, it's called You Were Never Really Here.
I think I may have said they were.
I don't even remember what the name of it was.
It's the shout out to I conquer in the chat.
He said, actually, Bugs Life is just a were seven samurai.
There you go.
Never really thought about that way, but I guess you could make that argument.
Yeah, well, I suppose that'll bring us nicely into the next topic
that we should probably go over, which is what is the difference
between referencing something, being an homage to something,
being inspired by something and ripping off something?
Apparently, if you hate something, it's ripped.
They ripped it off. If you like something, it was inspired by it.
Yeah, it's a perfect next question.
And depending on how broad you are, you can start to connect basically anything like
what film am I describing?
A group of individuals work together to go on an adventure
to prevent a dark force from essentially
tightening its stranglehold over the world.
Oh, Lord of the Rings.
Nope. Star Wars.
Every movie ever.
And obviously, you might be like, that's way too broad.
And I'm like, well, I don't know, it feels like people get very broad
when it comes to blaming ripoffery for a lot of stuff.
Captain Marvel.
Yes, I described Captain Marvel, the the team, our Captain Marvel and Fury.
And the dark force is what's his name, Jude Law.
He's the kind of Jude Law stranglehold over the world.
Blue Bloodman.
Someone said Incredibles.
The Warriors, Ghostbusters, Avengers, Suicide Squad.
I think Lord of the Rings is probably the most the thing you'd expect,
especially because it's because I said dark.
I think most people will be like, oh, Mordor.
Oh, that's what I was thinking.
You said a group of individuals, also known as a group.
Yes. Yeah, that was almost misdirection.
I was just like trying to extend it.
Like imagine multiple individuals,
many of them more than one of varying heights.
So, yeah, I guess the question becomes because there are a couple of videos
that believe Joker is blatantly stolen from Scorsese.
Others feel that it's simply inspired and taking from great works,
you know, just moving.
And that's what a lot of people, whenever you do an analysis of Star Wars,
people always want to mention the the Flash Gordon serials
or the influences from Japanese movies,
plus a combination with Western iconography and stuff like this.
And do you like did you rip those things off?
You're like, no, no, no, no.
They never say that in a derogatory way.
They say it was inspired by. Right.
Well, and that's the interesting thing, because we agree that ripoffs are a thing.
Right. So what movies are ripoffs?
And I assume one of the first things people are going to want to reference
is like Lion King to the White Wolf or whatever, or the.
Yeah, as far as I haven't seen Kimba.
But I hear it's a ripoff.
Yes. I keep hearing.
Yeah, I've heard the same thing.
Is you never hear it was it was a an homage.
You never hear that it's a or even a retelling.
It's just like, no, I ripped it off.
I guess a classic example, probably be a new Hope versus Force Awakens.
Was awakened depending on where you stand on that, I suppose,
because a lot of people are like, no, it's just trying to tell the same story
but to a newer audience and then other people are like, no, it ripped it off
and it ripped it off poorly.
You can tell the same story without just copy and pasting
all the major plot points, but poorly over to your new movie.
And so I guess a big or laser.
Our task today is to figure out what what Joker has done
and to address and and clarify these these perspectives
from a certain Ralph, the movie maker to see if they live in water.
People are saying that Kimba and Lion King are vastly different.
So if that is the case, I'm ready to believe it.
I just I just yeah, this is going strictly from what I've heard.
I have not looked into it.
I think I looked into it a long time ago.
This a little bit.
I didn't actually watch any of it.
I just read about what the synopsis was.
And I think the Kimba, the White Lion actually goes to the real world
that the the human world and hangs out over there for a while.
Simba doesn't do that.
So I'm not really sure what the series is about, but distinctly remember
that Kimba, the White Lion somehow makes his way to to the human world
and stays with them.
So that's not what Simba does.
So it doesn't seem like a ripoff at that moment.
So I don't know. I'm not really sure.
But I'm absolutely ready to believe that YMS talked about it on his stream
and said examples used to say that Lion King was a ripoff as super cherry picked.
I can see that. Oh, yeah.
I mean, oh, apparently YMS is actually going to go through it.
All right. Yeah, I'll I'll check that out.
If he does, that'd be interesting.
Someone saying Willow and Lord of the Rings.
I mean, there are there are things for sure.
Yeah, I think it was actually an inspiration.
Lord of the Rings was actually an inspiration for Willow,
because I think George Lucas wanted to make his own Lord of the Rings.
He did. Well, yeah, he wanted the rights to Lord of the Rings
to make them into movies. He couldn't get them.
And so that's how the story goes is he was like, fine, I'll make my own.
It's like, all right. Well, I mean, I've seen I know Lord of the Rings
and Willow pretty well, and I don't really like Willow that much.
But I don't know.
I don't think I would be comfortable calling it a ripoff of Lord of the Rings.
It depends on your definition.
Like if someone was like, he's clearly trying to be Lord of the Rings.
I'd be like, I mean, I guess there's a lot of differences.
One of the weird things to me is that there is a fellowship,
but they disband like in the first, I want to say 20 minutes of their adventure.
They just they all go back home.
And Willow's like, OK, I need to carry on.
But he meets up with Val Kilmer's character and Val Kilmer's character
is the one that a lot of people will say, like, saves the film
in terms of entertainment value in a lot of ways.
Willow was a good movie.
I like I wouldn't say it's a good movie, but in my opinion,
I really like that movie.
I mean, I haven't seen Willow yet.
It's it's interesting.
We could check that out sometime if you want to.
But I've heard it's interesting.
And I've heard that some people really love it.
And I've heard some people think it's terrible.
So one of these days we got to add it to the list.
Go ahead and add it to the list of movies we got to watch.
It's I guess that's it for the the movies
that we had to watch for Homework, right?
Because then we watched the other things we've been watching
and more just Oscar nominated films that we need to catch up on
in terms of what's good that came out.
I don't know if we want to talk about that or not.
We probably save it for another time.
But yeah, we could save it for another time or we could just briefly
just a brief. We saw this and we thought this.
Maybe just give people a little little updates.
Let me actually go through our downloads,
let's see all the stuff that we've been watching.
I think forever my download, I need to clear out my downloads folder.
Oh, well, from memory.
I mean, we can stay vague, but yeah, we saw Jojo Rabbit and it was really good.
Give it a give it a big thumbs up.
Big thumbs up for Jojo Rabbit.
I know what you saw in the 1970s literature devil,
which one was first off, first off, literature devil.
OK, your name is six syllables.
So we're going to have to do some about that.
What? What do you what do you normally go by?
If you were shorting it down to Lit Dev, Lit Dev.
Mm hmm.
Oh, you devil.
Fucking devil.
Can we call you Satan already of darkness?
The Lord of Lies.
No, we found out from infinite isms.
The devil never welches on a deal or whatever.
OK, then he can't.
Then let's make a deal.
Satan, you tell I'll ask you a question and you answer it.
So did you see Jojo Rabbit?
Did you like it?
I have not seen Jojo Rabbit.
No. All right.
We saw The Lighthouse.
Yes, I liked it.
I like it, too.
I liked it.
It's it's not a conventional movie in any means.
No, it's kind of it's like it's artsy, but in like a good way,
like legitimately actually a good way.
I was really, really, really.
And holy shit, Willem Dafoe.
Holy shit, man.
The fact that he was not nominated for some award is a crime.
I don't understand how that happened either.
You watch him with that film, but he is that character.
Willem Dafoe is God.
He's just this the old man.
Very well, he did very well.
Did you see The Lighthouse, Satan?
No, I haven't seen that one either.
Well, maybe you saw the other movie that we watched.
This actually in reverse order.
I'm going because I'm coming from left to right.
I'm a download folder.
We saw Parasite.
Yes. Parasite was good.
Are you and I the only ones who've seen that here?
I think so. I don't know what the fuck that is.
OK, well, yes.
Parasite was very good.
Yes. The just just every every filmmaking element was was was popping.
And a really, really cool story that I felt I hadn't really seen before.
And it's it was only after the when when the like to remain vague
when the brother begins to bring the sister in there, I was like, wait a minute.
Yeah, what's happening here?
I think the end was a bit tismy.
There's some tisms there. Sure.
But man, still absolutely worth watching.
Go watch Parasite.
Go watch The Lighthouse.
Go watch Jojo Rabbit 1917.
Go watch 1917.
Oh, yeah, I watched that yesterday in the cinema.
It was very good.
Go watch it again again. Good shit.
It was very, very good.
We can we can probably elaborate on them as time goes on.
But obviously we've already we're coming up to an hour long intro here.
So yeah, just a quickie little quickie little, you know, just looking at the
look like the films. Mm hmm.
Brushing up on our I don't know if we're going to do it.
I don't know if we're going to if we're officially going to do the fappies.
But we're the only reason why I'm against it is because of how we haven't seen.
Like, how would it work?
How do we nominate? How do we vote? How does and I know it's all for fun.
So who cares? But I'm like, I don't know.
We can what we can do is we can have personal fappies together.
Oh, no, not again.
We we can do.
I just like the idea that we nominated the chat get to vote on which wins.
I would legitimately be curious to see if we did line them all up,
what the chat would go for.
And then we could measure that against like what the professional award
giver people are at the Oscars or the Oscars if you're in Canada.
Judging from chat, I think Parasite would win.
People are very positive about that one.
Well, I know I have my list of movies
for next week when I'm on the train again for movies that with Parasite,
I wouldn't agree it's the best, but I can certainly see why people think that
because I really liked watching Parasite.
Yes, I don't know if mine is Joker or 1917.
Because I love both of those.
They would be my top two for the year.
Yeah, those would be top two.
I would like to watch 1917 again because Joker's fresh, doubly fresh.
So well, yeah, I guess naturally,
I think that brings us into today's topic, which is I did sort of introduce it
earlier, but Ralph the movie maker made a video and the second he made this
thing, fucking I got obliterated with DMS on Twitter and Discord.
It's like, have you seen this?
You see, okay.
So somebody said that Parasite is a movie about Jay and Eiffel.
We have been parasitic to his channel.
It's true.
Well, I should go for the toilet quickly.
I shall be right back.
Yeah, well, I'm going to go to the toilet before we start.
Fine. I'll do all of the procedural introductionatisms.
Fine. I'm OK with that. Hey, Satan.
Hello. Satan's friendly.
Civil. What do I need?
Yeah, so so I got set this video.
I was like, what the world's going on?
It's just like it's a bad take baller.
It's terrible.
Then I was just like, oh, it's probably not like, you know, that bad.
You check the percentage on it as in the for lack of a better term,
the approval rating, the ratio.
And it was like, I think 70 percent after a few hours.
And I was like, whoa, like whenever that happens,
that means your own fan base is upset.
And it's like, damn.
And I haven't watched this video yet, so I have no idea.
I started it. I didn't finish it.
Is it? I've heard it's really that bad.
Well, you're that bad.
We've got I've got I picked up a selection of comments from his own fan base
after after seeing me and ranks watch six minutes of it.
And we decided, OK, OK, enough.
Like this is we have to talk about this because,
you know, the idea that there are ways to write stories
is enough of an issue for people, as in a lot of people like, no, they're not.
You just do whatever you want.
But the idea that there are ways to write reviews.
Oh, my goodness, we're stepping into very controversial territory.
But I just I don't know.
There's going to be a lot of things he does in this video
that I would very much recommend against.
Why are you being so racist, right?
Yum. So are they going from
people are going from you're watching movies
wrong to writing reviews of movies wrong?
Well, I think that they're both crafts, you know, like
and you can like, first of all, bloody hell.
I get your details right.
That would be very accurate.
Also, I realize that that was an inside joke, so I probably should have done it.
But I called you Literature Angel, the description with your link
of people like, why did you do that?
I'm like, oh, yeah, that wasn't live.
I'll call it devil.
I don't need to explain that.
But it was it was funny.
OK, chat. Jeez.
You wouldn't get it.
It isn't funny, though.
I didn't laugh.
Why? Why must you shout?
Why must why must you be such a belligerent?
No, I may.
We didn't do nothing.
My head is the fridge right now.
Searching for beer.
German and abuse.
What do you mean, search for beer?
Where don't you just isn't it just in your fridge?
That was piled on food, below food.
I know where mine is.
In my belly.
In my belly.
Well, I got Austin Powers.
That's a trilogy I need to rewatch.
I'd like to watch that about every two years or so.
Austin Powers. Yes.
No, I've heard.
I've heard 1917.
It's also a really good move.
And it just involves a bunch of men and more.
So is that also an incel movie?
Yes.
They do not have sex in the movie.
OK, there was no fucking in this fucking.
Like the whole army, all incels out of them knew it
with their wives and children at home, fucking incels.
Oh, I guess we could talk about that really quickly.
But the criticism of 1970 for not having enough women in it, it was like,
what are you?
Come on.
Yeah, it's true to the time.
But I mean, we move past that we move past truth and facts.
We need to be more woke these days.
And there was like, like the argument was obviously
that the counter argument is obviously, but that's accurate.
And then the response is like, how much do we need to?
Like, this is not me saying this.
This is from a tweet.
How much do we need to talk about the world wars?
Like, haven't we done this enough now?
Like, can't we talk about something else?
Can we make stories about other things?
Many, too many movies about these world wars.
Can you imagine?
I mean, what were they anyway?
I mean, just something happened a long time ago.
Who even knows?
Old shit.
Some some guys fire in little pistols and stuff.
Silly.
Some people had disagreements
and some somebody got in the fight.
They had guns, whatever.
I mean, it's a long time ago.
Yeah, sorry, back on track.
So yes, this video.
And so we were told by several other sources
that this video's point is to trap things
like a fap or whatever.
And I was like, huh?
And it's like, there's references at the end
that are almost meta in relation to responding to critics.
And so the theory goes that this video
is presenting poor arguments on purpose
to be like, ha, got you.
Then why block?
Why block?
Well, I was gonna say,
we will not be showing the original on stream today
because we can't.
Ralph has disabled playback
on anything but YouTube with his video.
And this is like the only video he's done that with.
I can't imagine why.
There's no reason I could possibly imagine
why he would do that.
What a mystery.
But of course, people have already,
well, funnily enough, people, I think, re-uploaded it
because he took it down temporarily
to deal with a copyright issue.
And so someone was like,
oh, well, I just have a copy anyway.
So we can play it and watch together.
Yeah, so someone sent us a link.
You know who you are.
Thank you very much for doing that.
Yep.
Because we discovered,
we discovered,
because originally we could watch it.
And then after he,
I guess when he re-uploaded it,
there was some time there around
disabled it for replay on external sites,
which is something that you could do with your videos.
Something that he chose to do.
So, yeah.
Again, I'm not gonna ascribe motivation.
Who knows why he would do that?
There's a myriad of reasons.
And-
Is he scared of,
is he scared?
Is he protecting something?
Is he, I don't know, maybe his hand's slipping.
He just doesn't want people playing it on other sites.
He wants people to be watching on YouTube.
Makes complete sense.
Yeah, he's just protecting the brand, you know?
And so, yeah, it looks like you're all in.
I guess there's nothing else to say other than, yeah.
So we'll check it out.
And if we've been tricked
and this whole thing is a trick, that's fine.
We'll just pretend that some people took
the arguments very seriously,
or think that they're good arguments
and we'll respond to them anyway.
And that, you know, if it's all bullshit,
then that's fine too.
But, you know, we'll see from the tone of the video
if you guys think there's even a hint of that or not.
We'll see.
Yeah, anything else anyone wants to say
before we get started?
Cheers.
I-
Alki.
I think we're good.
Okay then, I'm excited.
Let me pull that cover off.
This is the introduction.
Yeah, okay, so just in case I don't miss it,
it says introduction on screen.
This is, this is it.
So, you know, I don't like to be serious,
but we lost a legend and it's very sad.
In 2016, universally acclaimed actor Jared Leto
took on the role of the Joker
and he gave one of the most memorable performances
of all time.
You want no beef?
You don't want no beef?
You don't want no beef?
You know,
we've talked about,
because me and Rags mentioned it, we were watching Joker.
It's so great that Waki managed to strike it out on his own
and make this new,
or just a different Joker character
while also being in the same zeitgeist
as Heath Ledger's Joker.
But maybe this Joker made it easier
because it's like, oh God, please, anything but this.
Lower the bar, set that bar way lower.
It's as bad as that last guy.
It's amazing how much this Joker was hated,
even though he was just in like a little bit
in Suicide Squad.
Yeah, they, he was very upset, Jared Leto,
that his parts were cut significantly.
In Suicide Squad?
Yeah, yeah.
Apparently he had way more scenes
and it's just interesting to me
because it's like, oh man, I don't know.
Maybe that was for the best.
The editor says, oh, this is his Joker.
We'll have to cut him out.
He's gonna downsize this guy.
I'm an idea.
Please stop it.
Well, I have to say his portrayal of the Joker
was fairly memorable.
That part might be.
Sure, sure.
Have you, wait, have you seen Suicide Squad ranks?
I have not.
It's such a.
I've heard terrible, terrible, terrible.
That's one of the things we watched
when I was first over at Mars.
Yeah, when you first came to visit,
we watched that with alcohol.
It was such an experience.
It's such a tism movie.
We watched Suicide Squad and the Ghostbusters movie.
Oh, but yeah, good stuff, good stuff.
So anyway, it has nothing to do with Ralph's video.
I just, it's just interesting to think about.
Yeah.
You don't like me?
We're gonna miss you, Jared.
I have a very cynical opinion of Joker.
It's so cynical and you can tell I'm annoyed
that I have to watch the movie.
You guys could kind of tell with the Aquaman video.
Oh, they're really running out of ideas, aren't they?
But you could really tell with the Joker.
Are they?
I guess in reference to DC,
I don't know the Aquaman.
That's not what I would have said about Aquaman
after watching it really running out of ideas.
It's just, it's such a fucking crazy rollercoaster,
that movie.
That was added in posts.
That looks like CGI, come on.
That looks like CGI.
I never noticed.
I don't think it looks like CGI.
When I watched this the first time,
I didn't think it was CGI.
Didn't even occur to me.
I mean, yeah, I didn't notice that it was CGI, personally.
I can tell you now it's CGI.
Yeah, even if you, when we first watched this,
we just, we screened this for the first little bit
of this video.
When he said this, I still can't see it.
Maybe I'm, nah.
Yeah, maybe there's telltale elements of CGI
that would give it away, but to me, it looks really good.
Yeah, it looks pretty good to me, proper.
One way or another, nothing wrong with it.
And I'll say that if you are,
I guess if you're covering the Joker
and you know that it's really beloved by a lot of people
and you're gonna take the position
that it's like not good and stuff like that,
I feel like you could have better examples than this.
Well, so strategy, right?
So let's say Rags is making his Joker video
because he fucking hates it, right?
He fucking hates it.
Fucking hate it.
Then he goes, he shows me the video before he's releasing
and he's like, what do you think?
And I go, ooh, ooh, ooh, ouch, oof.
Don't start with this, Rags.
If you wanna say this, move it to way later
because this is gonna give a really bad impression
immediately as to what you're doing with this video.
And then you're like, what do you mean, mewbshlee?
And I'm like, uh, so like, even if this was like hard CGI,
let's just pretend that for a second, like.
So, I think it's just, you know.
This is really your best first step forward.
Yeah, like, I'm not even saying,
because this is me we're talking about, right?
So I'm okay with you bringing this up as a discussion,
but maybe not the first thing,
just especially with a movie like this,
this is one of those divisive ones
that people are testy about,
which is that there's a lot of those.
I have had experience with such things
and maybe I could have been better in terms of strategy
for how I approach a lot of my movie criticism,
but I don't know why you'd open with this.
It's a strange strategy.
Somebody in chat mentioned it could be sugar glass
and I've never heard of that, so I googled it.
And apparently you can,
it's a brittle, transparent form of sugar
used to simulate glass in movies.
Never heard of this.
So that's really interesting.
Well, something else that glib facsimile,
the guy was talking about Blade Runner on episode New Year's Eve.
I can't remember what that was.
He was telling me about how on sets you can have,
it's like a double frame of glass,
as in the first one is not to be broken,
but also not gonna be damaging against the actor's head
while the second pane behind it
is one that's prepared to break
with like a switch or pulley or something like that.
As in, there's a lot of movie making strategies
you can do to it.
And CGI is obviously an option too.
I don't know which of the ones they used.
I can't tell.
So, you know, that's not really the issue.
I think the point overall is, it looks convincing to me.
It's an odd criticism to levy
right at the front of your video.
Yeah, no, that's all, that's all.
I think that if you're gonna put it in,
you might wanna aim for a different time.
Also, the third person of Ralph's commentary.
Yeah, that's a strange format.
Strange format.
And again, this is, I just think it's odd.
I just think it's odd.
So he does, I don't actually know this,
but I'm assuming he does audio commentaries he releases
and he's just clipping out pieces to the show.
Sure.
Yeah.
With the Joker one.
That was added in posts that looks like CGI.
Come on, that looks like CGI.
Was that even necessary?
Some producers are like,
oh, you gotta make it more dramatic.
He's gotta crack them.
Yes, it was necessary.
It really drives home how angry and frustrated he is
at that moment.
I think that at that moment, he just lost his job,
which was basically the one thing that gave Arthofleck
an identifiable identity at the moment.
Yeah, there were two things.
Yeah, he got fired and he learned that his buddy
quasi-set him up to the old man.
Kind of ratted him out.
Yeah.
He hit it.
People are saying that there's spam in chat.
I think that they're making the same mistake I did because-
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Look how much terror is.
I mean, what do you mean?
Um, like, it's got a lot of emojis,
but it's not actually spam.
Well, because they're saying things.
That's kind of why I'm like-
Scroll up a bit.
There's a lot of the same thing,
but it's all different accounts,
so you can't actually block it at once.
Well, they're not, but they're not spam though.
It's just that they stand out a lot more
because they're using the emojis.
Do you think it's supposed to be a clever form of spam?
I don't know.
If anyone wants xxx amateur sex videos, click here,
then there you go.
But they're actually making comments about CGI.
Yeah, some people have really bad takes about CGI,
so that seems like a real comment.
I'm one of them just added you, Rex.
I don't know.
Watch a Jackie Chan movie.
It's everywhere.
There you go.
I don't know.
But I guess-
One of them said his world was cracking around him.
There you go.
That's an insightful kind of thing
that somebody who makes video essays would say.
It's supposed to represent how his world is.
Oh, someone just said they steal comments
from chat to evade spam.
Is that true?
Really?
By having actual messages?
Let's see.
All right, well, let's kick them in.
Well, I was gonna say metal.
Are you able to keep an eye?
Someone is doing something, Rex.
Very clever.
Very clever.
Yeah, sorry.
I mean, this is the thing.
I'm learning.
Bots change all the time.
So if that's what they're doing, that's pretty clever.
Very, very, very clever.
Yeah, I have to admit it is clever, but annoying.
Clever, but annoying.
Clever, but annoying.
They're even copying Rhino Milk emoji.
Oh my God.
Oh my goodness.
They're cloning the toxic brew.
They're learning.
By the way, there was a obvious,
I've been told by some very,
for people who know what they're talking about,
that the Rhino scene,
the scene where Luke drinks the milk,
the best scene in the entirety of Star Wars.
Very good authority.
So I've been told.
Patrick Willems loved it.
He was one of his favorites.
Also, if you don't like that scene,
then you were a bigot and all that stuff.
That's really fascinating though,
the arc of these bots,
as in I went from thinking they were spam,
to not spam, to spam.
One of them said rags, it's spam.
No, I've been betrayed by my own tent.
Curse you, me.
All right.
Well, I was going to say, I think,
yeah, Dustbullshit and Metal and possibly a few others,
they should be here if you'll do a,
just knock them out casually
while we're checking this.
Yeah, just give them the old.
We don't, I don't like chat to be disturbed.
I'm sorry, chat.
I do try to keep you guys in good health.
I know we're burning up precious, precious time.
Yeah, how many fucking comes are they?
I know, right?
Fucking hell, Dustbull.
I picture the chat with like a cancerous tuba.
That was the character I noticed.
Like, argh.
We try to remove the tuba.
Maybe I can, can I block via account names
versus what they say?
Well, you can,
you can like hide user on the channel, so.
Yeah, it's just this one at a time.
Hopefully, I mean,
because I hate to essentially put mods
through the fucking.
Yeah.
This is why, this is why you are given the wrench.
Yes.
This is why, this is your holy duty.
I like that the chat's trying to counter with Rhino Milk.
It's like, fight back.
It's not helping.
Spam them right now.
We'll use our spam to fight their spam.
Spam all good for now.
Yeah, I mean, just, just,
if whoever mods are around, if you can just stay on it,
that'd be, thank you, thank you very much.
Sorry, xxx amateur sex videos.
Also, I like how, I like how in the super chat stream,
it's like, oh no, that's not actually a spam bot.
And I was like.
Yeah, I was thinking,
since we were supposed to be five men today,
and since this person has actually name dropped
in text in this video,
we could go ahead and add a mystery fifth guest
instead of our standard.
Oh my God, it's Ronald Reagan.
Why not Jeff?
Ronald Reagan wore a beanie in it.
Someone just emailed, someone just texted me.
I won't tell you who.
Do you get Honeycrisp or Gala apples?
What?
Neither?
I don't know, I just,
someone just texted me that.
I like the fucking Jay just said in chat,
hey, I answered your DM.
It's like, you're in the.
He had his chance, kick him.
He's weird.
He set his Discord notifications to like less than zero.
Like he just is completely unaware.
Less than zero.
Someone calls someone Discord and something else goes off.
Well, Jay, you can get in if you want to.
That is my position on this, okay.
All right.
They're really running out of ideas, aren't they?
But you can really tell what the Joker won.
That was added in posts that looks like CGI, come on.
Also, I know we're really, really harping on this,
but that seems like an odd,
this seems like a really odd comment to make
after the Aquaman, oh, they're running out of ideas
and they chose this.
Like the idea.
Maybe that was the end of a point
and this is the beginning of a new point.
Hello.
Jay, what do you think about Taxi Driver?
I think I've not seen it.
What do you think?
What did you think about falling down?
I've not seen that either.
Fuck, what do you think about Parasite?
I've not seen any of these films.
Fuck, what do you think about Tris?
1917 is the only one you're talking about that I've seen.
Rex didn't say 1970, you've broken the tone.
I was gonna, so at least he would understand
the depth of my disappointment.
I'll tell you what happened there, by the way,
is that I was on my PC when I sent the Discord message
and then I didn't think you'd seen it at all.
So I turned off my PC and I was on my laptop
and then you added me to the call and I was like,
oh God, I'm not ready.
And I hurriedly turned on my PC.
I wasn't ready.
You're incompetent and that is the way I love you, okay?
I wouldn't want it any other way.
There is a link you can find in the chat
to the watch together, Mr. J.
What if I don't wanna click it?
You don't have to, but it's gonna be confusing
to stay abreast of the situation.
Yeah.
That looks like CGI.
It's got me at the beginning.
We're talking about CGI, potentially CGI glass.
Let's play this part another time.
Hell yeah, CGI glass.
Oh my God, CGI.
In posts, that looks like CGI.
Come on, that looks like CGI.
Was that even necessary?
Some producers are like, I need to make it more dramatic.
He's got his crack.
Yeah, in case, my take,
I think you guys can imagine this,
but that's how hard he hit it.
Yes.
That's the point.
He's, this man is coming to the end of his rope.
Yes, he is very, very aggravated.
People are so like defensive.
No, here's the thing, like explain to us, Ralph,
why would it be better if the glass was unbroken?
I think it would have been worse, actually,
because that was supposed to be a dramatic moment.
And imagine how much drama would have been taken away.
How much seriousness would have been taken away
to hit his head on the glass and boom, ow.
The bounces.
He's like, ow.
He's not like Kyler Reinhardt in a meeting scene.
Oh God, yeah, true.
Ow.
Ow.
Well, we're in those last words.
Yeah, famous last words from supervillain Kyler Rein.
Ow.
He actually doesn't get to say anything
in that final scene, fuck.
Yep.
I mean, I think it might be on the same level
as Captain Kirk in that Star Trek movie
where his last words were, oh my, oh my.
You say that like those epic last words.
Hey, listen, well, hey,
what were Kylo Ren's last words?
Well, where have you been?
Ouch.
That's what we were just saying.
That's like the whole.
His last words were ouch.
That was a whole conversation.
Fuck.
To be fair, ouch is the really appropriate last words.
Well, I think the idea is that it sums up his character,
doesn't it?
Ouch.
I would argue that his last words
actually sum up the entire sequel series.
Ouch.
Ouch.
Yeah.
It's just the summary's a misstep.
They stood on a Lego where they were like, ah.
Oh, geez.
Captain.
All right, anyway, let's roll him back.
Let's get the full context for the next point.
No.
It would have been better if it just didn't do that.
People are so defensive about it
because it's a comic book movie.
I wish this movie was about insult.
Oh, because it's a comic book movie.
Wait, what's that?
All right.
Stop, stop, stop.
People are very defensive about it
because it's a comic book movie.
Here's what he said.
It's not really good.
The Joker is a comic book character.
It's the most un-comic book movie comic book movie
I've ever seen.
I mean, yeah, if we're gonna talk about
the sort of trope source or elements of comic book movies
we're so used to, this movie kind of isn't really
gunning for those at all.
It breaks away.
First being R-rated.
How many comic book R-rated are there now?
It's Deadpool, Logan, and this.
Is that it?
I guess.
Is Suicide Squad R-rated?
That doesn't count.
I don't even think it is, actually.
I'm not sure.
Is Blade?
Blade was pretty violent.
Squad rating.
It was rated PG-13, which means it's rated pretty good
by 13 people.
Well, I'm wondering why.
Next on our list is Blade.
Blade, not Blade Runner.
We're talking Blade, Black Blade, Wesley Snack.
When was the first one?
When did it come out?
I wanna say early 19s.
19, it'll autofill.
98, thank you, Little Rock.
Oh, late 90s.
It was a long time ago.
It was rated...
Fuck.
I'll let you find the rating.
Fuck.
That's an interesting rating, I think.
It's rated F for fuck vampires.
Well, it's 18 in Germany, at least.
Oh, it was, apparently, Watchmen was R-rated as well.
Oh, yeah, that's gotta be R-rated.
Definitely R-rated.
Yeah, all I was saying with that is that,
first of all, it puts it into a very small tier list
of even movies that are even allowed to...
Like, obviously, blood is typically avoided
in a lot of comic book movies,
because being a comic book movie means
that they kind of want to appeal to a large audience.
And I'm not going the Patrick Willems route.
He looks like an N64 bottle.
Oh, my God.
Hey, man, Blade is awesome.
How dare you?
Oh, look at his face.
Look at his face.
He looks...
He legit looks like he's...
I can see what you mean by that.
Looks like he's from Tomb Raider 2.
Steve and Dolph.
The CGI in that movie.
I'm here to raid your tomb.
You gotta see Blade.
Put it on the list.
We gotta see Blade.
Oh, the list is getting too big.
It's terrifying.
The power of an immortal.
The soul of a human.
The heart of a hero.
Wesley Snipes.
That sounds pretty gay.
Yeah, I mean, I'm on board.
Stephen Dolph.
So...
Stephen Dolph, where's that?
It's on the poster.
If we're going pragmatically, though,
it is a comic book movie in that it is an adaptation
of a comic book character from a comic book, right?
So...
Yeah, Jad saying he looks like Black JC Denton.
He does.
Maybe you should get a job.
But I wanna highlight, by the way,
that being defensive because comic book,
I mean, don't people like openly despise
a lot of comic book movies?
Like Suicide Squad?
Yeah.
Captain Marvel.
Captain Marvel.
A lot of disdain toward Marvel in general.
Like, I know you guys must have seen comments
like, ugh, Marvel movies.
Well, yeah, people make it all the time.
And we got upset at them for making those comments
because they love them all together
like they're all the same thing.
But it's like...
Crisis Infinite Earth, now it's like that.
Even shit that's like, TLJ Defenders,
I don't think you'd catch us saying,
oh, people only defend it because it's a Star Wars movie.
Like, no, they have like reasons that they're wrong.
Yeah, well, I mean, I don't think there is a person
who defends it because it's Star Wars
because Star Wars is such a crazy collection
of all these different things at this point.
Like, there's gonna be people,
but that's almost impossible now.
Like, it usually sits in with one of the many factions,
sequels, prequels, OT, or Clone Wars,
or Mandalorian now, you know, lots of different things
and what actually makes a Star Wars movie
a Star Wars movie.
But yeah, people are over to the defensive
because it's comic book.
I'd be like, that's pretty vague, but all right.
It's like, if you can find the one person
who is saying, is making that argument,
that's not representative.
There are lots of people who have reasons
they actually like this film,
and it's pretty shitty to just dismiss them all like that.
Well, so yeah, and again about strategy
in terms of video essays,
like starting out with accounting
for people who would disagree with you immediately.
Like, you can do it, I think, feasibly.
It's just that it will give a strong impression
to a lot of people already.
Like, wow, you're like pre-bitter
about how people are gonna live.
Hmm, well, it depends how you do it.
Yeah, that's what I was saying.
And a lot of people have told me
that context for this is apparently he was like
partially hounded by his own fan base
to make a Joker video
because of the fact that he has
untraditional views on it, which makes sense, I think.
Like, if we were to come out and say,
I don't know, the same thing.
Like, the Joker was this garbaged, awful movie
that people would be like,
can you tell us why specifically in detail or whatever?
And I guess this was his response.
And so he felt like he had to account
for the fact that people are gonna be pissed at him.
He knew that, but I don't know his strategy
in putting that in his video managed to translate well.
Let's put it that way.
Let's kick on, shall we?
Better if it just didn't do that.
People are so defensive about it
because it's a comic book movie.
I wish this movie was about incels.
At least it wouldn't be so boring.
That cut, though, that cut bugs me.
It bugs me.
It bugs me.
Was the cut like that because all of those clips
were for his audio commentary?
I mean, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna get a little from it, sorry.
Well, no, before it he had a weird audio inconsistency too.
But if you're going like from a tactical perspective,
if you're making a movie talk about how a Joker's
not very good then insulting your audience,
probably not that like, for instance,
we're gonna have a Mandalorian eFap
and after the Mandalorian eFap,
I'm gonna make a Mandalorian video
telling people how terrible the writing is.
I'm not gonna insult people and tell them that they're bad and horrible and that well right bad for liking doo-doo
We haven't gone to that yet
But yeah
Maybe he'll say something that cuz at this point. It's like it's like shaky ground
It's like this is great, but I have it's fine. It's fine. We'll see how it progresses
Oh like defensive about it because it's a comic book movie
I wish this movie was about ourselves at least it wouldn't be so boring at least then I could have related to the film
It's such a shame. No one can give honest opinion of this movie without having a bunch of children on the internet gang up on
Listen listen
Don't frame it like this don't frame the other side is like if you want to yeah
I know you're taking an unpopular position
so we do is less of this and more of
Because of this that happens because of this scene because of these words in the script because of this reference I can prove
With confidence that this is actually a bad film. You don't want to poison the well essentially and make people hate your face
All right the beginning so if I'm willing about what a minute and 17 seconds in and he's already done the same exact
made the same exact arguments and points as many of these TLJ defenders do with it, it's true because I say it is and
It is if you are if you'd like this movie or just like this movie
If you disagree with me
With your thoughts I was paying attention. Yes
The main argument is that usually if you disagree with them you are defective in some way and he's already done that
It's already been a minute and 17 seconds. So this is already fairly promising
Well, he's he's already assumed the reason why we like it. It's not we don't just like it
We like it because it's a comic book movie
But you're all man babies and fans and DC fans or whatever. You always re-like the Joker. There's no real defense
It's just but but he thinks it's bad because he says it's bad
Yeah, well, I take more issue with just the the like people like being mean to you because you talk about this thing
It's like dude. What does that not apply to outside of like ubiquitously agreed upon?
Perspectives on movies. So for example, I come out with a video saying Suicide Squad sucks
I don't even expect to see a comment that says nah, this film was a masterpiece
I might be lucky and see it randomly. But if I was to come out and be like, I don't know
What's what's like a movie that doesn't typically get criticized that is calling the prestige?
Oh, why would I why would I do that to myself? Okay, like come over the video called the prestigious is a disaster trash fire
I would expect a lot of comments be it like you're off base on this one. This is a bad take
I don't see even if they hadn't seen the video just because it's like yeah, that's that's that's gonna be that's what's gonna happen
It's YouTube
And I think that's
Children that so and so I would I would I would be okay with someone having like a disclaimer beginning because like I know people
Like to have it and I maybe even I would in a long form. I say long form. I mean longer than my rage and praise
Video where I might go like please just give my arguments a chance before you tell me I've been saying that's all
Yeah, like I'm not trying to be antagonistic
I'm not trying to shit all over your hopes and dreams as of a movie
I just I really do think that I'm correct. And here's all of my arguments for why and
Then you make the video you don't this isn't what you open with. We got 23 minutes to go Ralph
So someone said you're wasting time. We've got 11 hours
We'll be able to make it through don't worry
Whoever said that. Mmm
also
It wouldn't be as bad if not for he refers to those children. It's like oh, yeah
And it's like, okay there are
What if I went to my fucking comment section now, there would be some guy going why are you such a fucking loser talking about?
Star Wars film bad. It's like yeah, they're children, but not because of their perspective because they're twats
It's like yeah
and then the other I guess the other issue is just like who you referred to Ralph just like asshole idiots or like people being like
I think that your take-out Joker is inaccurate compared to the film of child
Silas child one thing that's interesting too. Is is that he couldn't even say something like
like people are just defending it because they really
sympathize with the character or the movie tries to convince them to
This that and the other thing like it can't even give us the benefit of the doubt
It is they give us such child like really gives very very childish
You'll protect the brand kind of kind of motivation basically just dismissing the people who disagree with him
He's dismissing their opinions as nothing but childish notions
Someone said the illusionist is better than no it
I saw the illusionist with John Adams in it and yeah, no no
His name the actor's name
What Paul Giamatti I forget his name all the time. I like you calling him John Adams. I'm okay with that. I
Really like the illusionist, but the prestige is better than the illusionist
JB singing in the chat
so I saw the illusionist soon after I saw the prestige and I was so disappointed because for some reason I was retarded and I
Thought I was gonna get a movie like prestige is it like as good as well written. I was like, wait, why did I think that?
The illusionist was one of those movies that I told my mom is like mom you should watch the illusionist you'll like it
It's it's she cuz she watches the it's like a Hallmark movie. It's just a step above a Hallmark movie, right with
Oh
Liking Iron Man 3 over prestige. No
Oh, yeah, I made I forced I strapped Jay down and forced him to watch prestige Jay. What did you think of prestige?
The next day on a stream I was asked hey have you seen this cool movie the prestige no
Oh
Yeah, fuck I forgot to mention cuz like if you remember rags we did the I doubt you forgot we did the the copyright meme
Recording we've done that now
We've looked at all the meme videos that had copyrights in them with with with wolf and one of the memes had
When wolf is asking you what films you've seen and he asked you if you've seen prestige and you say no, that's inaccurate now
Yeah
Yes, that information is now officially out of date
One film at a time. That's why you gotta keep up with the faps cuz we're always pulling a fast one on you
You can't go by the old info
Anyway
Let's kick on
Shame. No one can give her honest opinion of this movie without having a bunch of children on the internet
Hey, I hate these us. No one can give that honest opinion of this film like
I
Will Ralph be
If you said talk shit about it, he'd be really showing his hand but you know, no one can
Absolutely. No one can give their honest opinion. So if you would like this movie
That means he's kind of implying that if you say you like this movie, you're lying. Well, I I actually do think
I
Think he thinks that a lot of people don't realize that they're sort of they're being biased towards Batman content
When we put content and they're not realizing that this film isn't actually that good
So they're not like capable of being honest with themselves. I suppose
It's hard to interpret that in a good way
It's not a great. Is that why am is that why suicide squad is universally defended?
By the five stars
Yes, it's what has Joker in it has Batman in it
Justice Justice League has Batman and Superman fighting
Yes, two monster like it's just you gotta people thought that was garbage
Well, I think I think that's the universal opinion for the most part, right? There's some people who really like
Oh
That's neat
I don't like it. You know metal rags say
Animated French film I
Doubt it, but if they are then
Asterisk on all the things that I've just said
All right, let's
Such a shame no one can give their honest opinion of this movie without having a bunch of children on the internet
Gang up on you and like people like harass me guys you realize we're a bunch of children ganging up on him, right?
I
Mean we've fallen for the fucking
Give their honest opinion this movie without having a bunch of children on the internet gang up on you and like people like harass me
About these
So I don't want to even discuss it so don't
Almost getting parity by it from this if that's the thing there are there are moments where you can be like this is a joke video
Right, but I'm almost I don't want to say it's true because I'm not in his head
But because I follow him on Twitter and I've seen him, you know promoting this video
I'm pretty sure he he considers this video like, you know good shit. He believes in what he says in this
It's like if you don't eat if you think that you're gonna get harassed for giving your
Honest opinion about it. You don't have to do it. You don't have to talk about Joker
You can make movies about other movies make videos make your video movies
You if you do the rest for making for sharing a perspective. You can do it in more pragmatic ways
Yes, then well, I don't want to fucking talk about this because we'll
Idiots the thing. I don't know how
Children see things like I do if you like this you're a child. What are the troops?
Like all we needed was this to be the opening the sigh and then didn't want to make this video
Just make something else
The use of the word these use of the word harassment really makes it feel like he's lampooning the people who this complaining cry about this stuff
He said
You guys just a bunch of children
The Joker is good because it's a comic book movie that's why it's good
But at the same time I recorded all this audio about Joker, you know, cuz it's like a commentary track
Sure, no fucking head. It's like yeah, I did. Of course I did what what was gonna what else was gonna happen with him?
What were they gonna? Okay, okay, so
The whole movie he pretends to kill himself and the auditions killing himself and he practices killing himself
Yeah, and he's like, oh, I'm gonna tell this joke and I'm gonna shoot myself in the face
and even in the dressing room right before he gets on right after
Right after Oldman and his friend leave the dressing room place Murray right after Murray and the other guy leave his preparation room
I don't know what it's called. I'm not in the biz he
The preparation age room
what he does is
He he pretends one last time to shoot himself right before he goes out
And then right before he goes out as they're getting ready to introduce Joker
They replay all of the clips where Murray's making fun of him and all that stuff
So you're like, oh which way which way is he gonna go?
Is he gonna shoot Murray or is he gonna go through with the plan that he's had? What do you mean? They replay the clip to this
Yeah, they they do the audio
Do they I completely forget? Yeah, like yeah, cuz cuz when he's behind the curtain, right?
Smoking and he's waiting for his time to go out. You can hear the audio of them playing the segment
Okay, this guy and then they they're playing the audio
We don't see it because this is the Joker's perspective behind the curtain before he goes out. They're playing it. There's scenes
So I know when I watched it, I was like, what's he gonna do? What's he gonna do?
No, no, I didn't know I didn't know I was gonna shoot zero. It's gonna shoot himself. I don't know what else gonna happen
I got I got got I got two two golden counters
All right first of my I'm gonna crack open the golden egg and bring out a counter. So first one is
If you just jumped on a shot DeNiro would have been like, whoa
That's not the the character we've been we've been learning about through this whole movie
like his whole thing is that he's supposed to knock out people who are who are awful and
He's definitely got a reason to dislike Murray at that point, but he he makes clear that he's like
Happy to be brought on the show cuz it's a dream of his and so there's a lot going on in Joker's head at this
Point so we need a scene him to unravel and focus and that's what happens in that scene
Combined with all of the efforts from not only the people on the couch DeNiro and the audience
essentially like
jabbing and
belittling as he's trying to kill himself like he's trying to deliver his payoff and he's like fucking hell like
I can't even do this
That he goes on his rant. So then he's like, you know what? Nah, I'm gonna kill you
Cuz you're awful. That's that's that's how he justifies it. Secondly, um, I care a lot more about the the execution than
whether or not I know a
Vaguely or all strictly where it's going
The there's a lot of movies I would say that this would surely apply to that are considered classics or greats that we know
We can tell what's probably more than likely going to happen, but we're in it to see how it all comes together
For example, I don't think the Emperor was gonna win in Star Wars
And yet I was hooked. I I don't know that
Exactly how but that ring is is probably gonna get booped just saying like Jay hasn't seen the two Lord rings
Hey, I'm saying it probably will get boobs. There's no I don't know. I don't know
and as
Go ahead. Yeah. So what I was gonna say was that I think that being predictable or
Boring in your in your monotonous in your approach
It's just like there's more to the argument. Surely it's not just did you know or did you not know what was gonna happen in this payoff?
Did you know did you did you think it seems to only apply to him?
Cuz I didn't know I it was a possibility, but I didn't know and as some of the
Yeah, I was a stupid child likes comic book movies
Someone chap pointed out that while when he pulled out his notebook, right and he's looking through the notebook pages on the couch
What what do we see? He says I hope my death makes more sense than my life
So like oh, maybe he's gonna kill himself. Oh knows and so I mentioned Titanic
No, no that ship's going down I would love it if that film it just it just didn't
It's like they find you like wait
Say what's gonna happen at the end well and and that highlights the I guess the final argument which is
Are you able to rewatch films or no?
Because yeah, you can in fact, I think what the Titanic has gone down in history as one of the classics you
Can watch over and over?
But you also, I mean you have Shakespeare's stories people play them over and over again
They keep producing these plays over and over again. I'm pretty sure you know what happens by now
pretty sure that you know Romeo and Juliet kill themselves at the end and
I'm pretty sure we most people know that they fall in love during the play
Mm-hmm people still like it people still like it and it's the thing is it's not really about being predictable or
Subverting your expectations or being unexpected. That's always nice
but it's the quality of a twist the quality of
What with the event that comes in is it good?
Is there a good twist people always bring in the sixth sense that well, we didn't see that coming
Well, you know what happens now. It's still a watchable movie. It's still people still rewatch it because it's really good twist
It's about the quality of the twist the quality of the storytelling
Not so much as I did I get a few seconds of excitement cool Satan
Have you considered that you're a child who likes?
I didn't I never consider that I know I know it's true already. So
damn you
I've been counted. So yeah, see and so I'm pretty sure he doesn't develop this point or at least
I can't remember that he that he does or doesn't but I would be like this this could be a point
It depends on where he takes it because this is on its own. It's just not much to work with
Yeah, I did of course I did what was gonna what else was gonna happen with him
Thing that he auditioned the entire movie and
Movie to do and say that he was gonna do the whole time
Especially nowadays with movies who knows what's gonna happen. We're all so used to being surprised
You know what it's easy to say after the fact, yeah, I knew it all along
He's like, did you did you really you kind of vibe where he's kind one of those guys who watches a magician do his trick
He's I know how that happened. I want you to explain his trick. It was like shut the fuck up. He's like, oh
Talk it out. Oh, yeah, Joker. Let's talk it out. That's what you wanted to happen, right? No, it's an obvious
Cheap ending. He fucking shoots cheap ending cheap ending
He's going to kill himself
He's going to make a big big show about himself
No killing himself to prove his point and then obviously he changes plans
At the last second, it's easy to see that he changed plans at the last second and shoots Murray instead
Yeah, I would say it's very informed that that exchange in on Murray's show, especially with us knowing how unhinged he is with a gun
It's very tense. At least I found it very tense. I was like, yes
I was kind of personally hoping that he would pull a dark knight returns and kill everyone in the audience
But I guess just killing my
So you just blows up you just keep shooting never reloads he just has Dante clips
Oh, yeah, Joker, let's talk it out. That's what you wanted to happen, right? No, it's an obvious
Ending shoots obvious cheap ending. Okay, I'll be sheep ending
One dimensional characters every character aside from Arthur only serves to enforce the message that society is bad
They don't have any qualities of their own. The only two likable people Arthur knows that a woman of color and a dwarf great
Right. Why is that?
Why oh
Why is that?
Why is that?
Why is that?
Why is that?
Why is that?
Why oh my goodness
Why why would you why did you phrase that that way?
The only two likable people Arthur knows are a woman of color and a dwarf
Why not say his therapist and the character's name the co-worker and well, it's it's the imaginary
It has to be dismissive about it has to be
Dismissive way so it can sound worse. There are two ways to interpret this
I think the women of color and dwarfs aren't supposed to be likable
I'd love it. It says great writing after it
Writing is writing is capitalized. Like why is writing capital? Let's see this again people be like, oh
Surely his parody is like well
The
The awkward thing is that like this poor guy if he made this fully
Intending to supply some strong criticism that he's like everyone's like good joke Ralph. He's probably like fuck off
If you're gonna try and convince people that they're wrong about a movie and you're right
You did nothing in that whole introduction or first segment
To explain why any of this was wrong. You were just like go. I knew it
I'm right. I understood because i'm right. I'm right and it is
Rex did you just say sigmund?
Sigmund is that is that Freudian's first name? No sigmund Freudian
Sigmund Freudian
Also, what else is he what else is he expecting?
Is he supposed to is every character in the film supposed to be this three-dimensional character with his own foot right
I guess yeah, so let's let's assault this criticism then
So it's giving me stronger parody vibes
Is there anyone who is more than one dimensional in this film outside of joker be like so let's just try a first reference
The guy who's his friend and colleague who is like look after yourself. Here's a gun
but turns out he backstabs him in an attempt to uh
Obviously force out more clowns of the actual agency that I imagine gets you more
Jobs for the rest of the clowns that are there naturally it's spread it's red thinner. So
Surely that's multi-layered right or does that not count? I don't I don't I don't know
Specifically how one-dimensional versus two-dimensional is classified, but I always assumed it was about um, they're shown to have more than one
interest or purpose or motivation like a character that's
More interesting than being there for one intention
I think we're that guy is actually just a human thing. I would I would guess like in the beginning. He just wanted to make
Actually, I'm starting some money. I'm starting easy sort of thing
I'm just like there's that guy like he's he's a character everyone agree
Like I think it goes slightly beyond one-dimensional like, okay, cool. Uh, the social worker that's uh, giving him let's call it
limited therapy
Um, yeah, so she's giving him all this
The wahmen of well, I don't know which one he's referring to when he says that because it could be the imaginary girlfriend
Who's nice to him on the elevator, right?
I guess he's just like woman of color, you know all of them that are the same
Um, okay. Thanks. Ralph. So she uh
Simultaneously is the standard sort of trope therapist character being like, how are you? What have you written in your journal?
What are your thoughts like that sort of thing?
But then you find out later which I thought was interesting that
She's very unhappy about the situation. She thinks she's being treated like shit. She's not one of the ones that's victimizing him
she's victimized as well and that um
I suppose he's countering that ahead of time by saying that
These two that i've mentioned so far the one that's kind of a backstab to a degree and the other one that's uh saying
She's that he's not the only one that's been beaten down. They both represent society bad
which makes them
Non-layered, uh would be the argument here. I suppose
Um
But but I I don't think that's fair
at all
Think about the joker the joker movie though is that isn't it's more or less a character piece like a character study of arthur fleck as he
Just spirals down into this journey of madness and insanity and all these characters are supposed to be there
So that they can help highlight
His changes and how he reacts to the world
We need to see how he reacts to the world at the beginning of the movie and how he does so by the end
And these other characters don't really need to be fleshed out. They're basically just there to help flesh out arthur fleck himself
Well, yeah, and exactly they're not on screen for very long
But I I even take issue with the idea that they're one-dimensional. I'm like, I don't know
I think they're shown as relatively fleshed out though. Some people
Are mentioning murray. It's like yeah
I actually quite like the details in in how murray speaks to to joker especially the uh, you don't know me
as a as a big counter to
What a lot of people do in this film mainly being thomas and uh, arthur they they broadly paint
um an entire group of people
or um in joker's case, it would just be society as a whole a horrible and then um,
obviously
uh murray comes back with first like he's because he's like you're awful specifically and most people are just horrible in general and
He's like one they're not too. You don't even know me like you can't even conclude that about me
um
And you know combine that with with his uh tv show style host sort of character
I don't know. I just think that there's there's clearly more going on there than than one dimension. I think it's unfair to say that about the
The characters in this film despite the fact that they don't necessarily need to operate further than that because this entire film
Is what you call a character study. He's it's entirely about arthur
Yeah, it's it's all it's um
This is reminding me of uh, you know that you know that guy on the death star who pushed the leader that blew up alder on
He's a bad character. Is that 10 grineet teen grineet something like that?
Green tea rant. Yeah, we need to see his uh, his entire household and his his likes and hobbies
So that we can fully have a three-dimensional character who pulls a lever that destroys everything from the death star
And if we're seeing pretty much all of this is from kind of his perspective, right?
How much do you really know?
Your co-workers. How much do you really know your shitty therapist?
How much do you really know just the random people you meet around and about like how?
like you think about a lot of the people that you sort of know of and know but
You don't like know them are those three-dimensional characters in your story movie life?
They're probably not
So describing the only two likable people does he mean
The people who are liked by arthur or does he mean just likable characters in general?
I like the dwarf his dwarves are funny
I mean because i'm just gonna say I liked uh, I like murray
I like yeah murray seems like a nice guy sort of i like this character too
Um, not a bad person. I wouldn't have concluded. He was a bad person. He just uh, he's not a bad person
He just does something that's kind of means that's mean-spirited to arthur. He's a comedian. He mocks things. That's his job
That's what he does for a living. Well. Yeah, I was gonna say people who play other people's content to make fun of it
Uh, they're evil people
Satan is that what he's doing. It's you're calling satan evil really
I'm asking satan if murray went to hell. How dare you
Oh, yeah, did murray go to hell we can confirm if he was a good guy or a bad guy
Or did he go to purgatory?
Why did you say that like you were making a pun
Like purgatory like a cat thing. I think he was I think he's just referencing infinitisms. I think that's what that was
I'm referencing like a crisis
Episode
Where they go to purgatory and then they rescue
Archer from the from the being dead
But then another man shows up and says no come with me and then he does
No, we're getting off top no
Fuck the what's this buried hell or a shitty cgi purgatory?
You need to couple damn it satan
But I suppose he is he is accurate in the those if he's referring to the two people that arthur
Likes the girl in the elevator and the dwarf. Okay
And I think uh one thing that really helps flesh out characters is conflict
And if you the guy that gives that gives artifact the gun, okay
The guy that gives him the gun in the first place
He is set up to be this um, you know guy who maybe maybe was looking out for him in the first place
And then he turns kind of turns into the jerk co-worker and that if he was one dimensional
That's all he would have been but if you remember in the later half of the movie
He actually comes back comes back to um, arthur's apartment after they had this big conflict after arthur flexes went into the um
no clown changing room and
Through that tantrum and blamed him for giving him the guns out of him and they had a big falling out with each other
And he came by to check on arthur flick anyway, uh towards the end of the movie. He ended up getting killed for it
But uh, that's not something a one-dimensional character would do
A motion one-dimensional character in his case the jerk co-worker would remain just a jerk co-worker and that's all he would ever be
Yeah, good point. Well put
Can I just say that this text is too far down the screen? It should be it's not I agree
Well, you'd be no
That's that's this is how you do it. Okay when you're sent to your fucking text
Also this the text is wrong
Yeah, no, I agree with that too yeah the the the mess not only is it too low
It is incorrect. Well, look at that statement in the middle. They don't have any qualities of their own. What nonsense is that?
Like of course they do there's those are like
Elements to each of these people that you can pull out
Like uh easily from any of these scenes. There's but give me a character and i'll tell you uh a quality
Then you go. All right. Okay, murray murray
Uh clearly tries to make a joke out of mostly everything keeps the everything light. He's he's interested in making people laugh. He seems to be um
That's that's his goal as a person
I would say before when murray's in the dressing room with arthur. He's actually really nice to him and he and he
Asses to his request
He adapts in in his show
You can clearly tell that if if arthur could have taken it any way he wanted to
Arthur could have been like really down to earth and friendly to him and I think he would have been friendly back but
The second he says like
Fucking I killed those three people. It's like you could tell like murray's immediately
Like that's almost a challenge in terms of control over the the show
Like uh, I think I think murray recognizes like he's trying to celebrate himself
Be like I killed those people and it felt great and then he's like, you know
You think that's good?
You think it's good to kill people because even as producers like this is fucked up and then murray's like no
I got this I got control of this
Just didn't expect him to have a gun. Obviously that kind of changes the power dynamic. But uh
Yeah, um
And then you'd be like, no, he's just a representation of society bad. I'd be like, oh
Can you just make this argument for like any character ever?
Murray doesn't seem like that bad of a guy
He doesn't
Seems like a nice man
Even I think that if um, he does nice things
I think if joker had said to him when he met him that it really upset him seeing that uh video on his show
Yeah, that uh, he would have apologized. Yeah, he proven like, you know, that's not that's not what the show was about
It's not supposed to be that we're just trying to have a bit of fun and that um, you know
I'm, sorry that it did that. I I could totally see him doing that
Just it's just pilots on to his already
Persistent issues that he has and then his idol is just like oh look at that goofy fucker
He's so stupid
So for him it's like a matter of perspective for him
It's like super evil right now because he fucked him over like his idol hates him and just ridiculed him
Yeah
After he learns that his mother might be you know, messing with his entire life
He sees the broadcast of them making fun of
Him and he's like, oh now the person who I in some way
See as my father figure
Now he's turned on me too. Both of them have turned on me
He's turned on
He's turned on
Looks like a flashlight in the dark
But yes, um, let let us venture further into this video
Yes
Todd phillips has always been a comedy director and some of the character writing and scenarios in this film feel so simplistic
It's like out of a comedy joker is in the subway and three guys
So I don't I don't think he knows what comedy means. I was about to say I don't like the
The loaded statement there that implies that comedy means you have simple setups
Yeah, that's that's stupid. Uh, you get all kinds of setups in comedy
Well, not even I think that you can make great comedy out of simple and complex setups. It's the same with drama. Yes
I mean, yeah people rub their jerks on subways
Allegedly
Allegedly. I just back me up on here subwayman. It's just a straight like, um
I disagree with your premise that he's like moving on to another point and i'm like, but he didn't even have to
Narios in this film feel so simplistic. It's like out of a comedy joker is in the subway and three guys are there
And they're bullying a lady and then the guys bully him. I think sounds simple when you say it like that
I was gonna say
Well, hey look i'm not being uh condescending here. He he's he's pointing this out. So I have to reply like this
Humans take the subway regularly. It's a it's like a faster way of traveling. Um
During the night time. It's very common for people who have been drinking to use public travel because they can't be relied to drive themselves
Joker's they're late. He's uh
It's after he's been fired. He's down in the dumps. He's taking the subway home
um, we see we saw him take the subway home before there's somebody does partially regularly and uh, three dudes are there they're drunk and they're um
They're fucking with somebody this this is a common occurrence in many places
But this is one of the worst cities in the country as far as I can tell with what this movie is trying to portray
Gotham's a shithole. So uh, yeah rough urban
Environment so does that all make sense and i'm just like makes sense to me. I don't see
What movie is he watching that has all the every scene is complex in some way
No, listen arthur fleck
He is he finds himself aboard an airship
a zeppelin if you will
After the failed jewel heist he has to escape the country while the heat dies down and he meets captain
yo hansen the third
famed dog trainer and secret nazi
And then
Secret communist nazi. That's no that's not a comedy. That's a very complicated setup
So it's a don't call it a subway. It's a great iron web
The great iron
Yeah, uh as jay pointed out first, uh, you could do this with everything ever um
Oh, okay a bunch of people go to a place to do a thing. Okay
Oh, there's a guy and he likes there's another guy who kind of looks like him great setup
Uh, gemno, man
face off
Not applicable
Is in the subway and three guys are there and they're bullying a lady and then the guys bully him
They hit him with the sign they beat him up. All these bad things happen to him all at once
Oh stop stop stop stop
You can do this to anything. Okay
Oh, this happens and this happens
Why did he just weirdly combine the the first seed to one of the
Latest scene in the movie. I take grand issue with saying these all happen at once
Wow, well, that's just fantastic. Are you sure there's not a parody?
So he simultaneously while at work has a sign stolen as he has his mother
suffers a heart attack and he sneaks into a movie theater it all happens at once
It's all it's all one one scene
So, um, I think jenny, uh, sorry jebby made this point as well that it the all of it happens too quickly and all together
And it's just like all random
um
I think some people fail to realize how connected a lot of these sequences are as in the
The nature is like why does he get fired from his job because he has a gun while he's doing his work
Why does he have a gun? It's like a friend offered it to him as a result of being beaten up and you're like my kids
It's like oh, so those events are directly connected and it's like why was he given no chances after the gun was found as well?
It's like well because he'd lost he'd already had a warning after the sign
And that was directly connected with being beaten up as well
Like the the nature in these events to be like oh soldiers, you know, he walked down the street
Some guy punched him. He kept walking down. Some other guy just punched him. It's like no, let's stop what happened. Is it?
Because of this shot someone in the head of live tv. It's like whoa
Stop. Yeah, these are all connected. It goes from one one event to the next everything is flows evenly because of because he got beaten up
Uh, he lost the sign because he got lost the sign
He got in trouble at work because he got in trouble working beaten up
He got his friend gave him a gun before because he got a gun, you know, and so on so forth
Every single main event in this movie is connected. It's not random
It's not just all thrown together at at well at random. It's not it's all connected to well paced
Oh, yeah, you know, how does he shoot those guys on the subway? Where'd he get the gun from?
He was he just pulled out either. Oh my god
Oh my god, and it all starts with a bunch of little fucking jerky kids taking the man's sign
And it all just begins in avalanche and it's almost to argue
Why would kids take a sign as I think um kids you fucking idiot
What they do they do dumb stuff for this there was a there was a fucking love signs
There was a post on reddit, uh of it was just called kids are assholes
And it's just a guy recording from his phone
There's like six kids that are just trying to pick up and turn over a car. It's just on the street
It's just parked and they do it and the second it topples over they just sprint away. It's like wow
Thanks a fucking lot
I was like, of course kids do shit like that the last day of school when I was in the eighth grade eighth grade, right?
so here in america
Uh, that's the grade before you go to high school, right?
so
Eighth grade last day of school was a kid in my class. His name was hunter
Right and he he pisses on the outside of the school building, right?
And and they could tell because cameras exist
But also because there's this big old wet spot on the side of the building where someone had clearly pissed on it
Last day of school. He's fucking idiot
He had one more day to go and he was scott fucking free, but he pissed on the building. Why because kids are dumb
Kids are dumb and they'll do anything for a laugh or a giggle
Or something. I got my car. Someone said they're teenagers not kids
What say they back so kids so when we say kids so once you turn 13 you are a mature adult
And you don't do anything childlike at all. That's a good argument. I hope you feel glad that you made it one time
Some kids keyed my car. My car was just sitting there as they do and they were walking down the road
And one of the kids saw it and they walked a little bit further. You know, look back
They went and he made a bunch of key car marks on over the hood and he ran away
Why because he's just I don't know because kids are fucking assholes
Ralph
Hey, ralph didn't say that
I know you're fucking 12 years old or whatever ralph. Geez, you know this shit
Kids do dumb things. You know what you've taken it too far
We've been assaulting someone who doesn't even
Like it was it was jeppy. He said that right?
Why would kids take a sign?
Well, the fucking guy in the movie said that as well the guy what guy in the movie?
Oh, yeah, the boss man. The point being
And then he's like, why would you believe that I would take the side?
He's like it doesn't fucking matter. The sign's gone. I think it doesn't matter where the side is
I don't know why people do the things they do. He says that because I don't know why they do people do things. I don't know
Why do people do anything? This is the thing if you're going to appeal to no
Nobody would do nobody would do something so horrible as to hit another human i'd be like oh, man
Yes, anyway
And then the guys bully him they hit him with the sign
They beat him up all these bad things happen to him all at once the king of
All at once how would you say something and he just moved on to say the king of comedy is so much more subtle
I'm very, uh curious. Yeah, tell me about this. Tell me about the subtlety of the king of comedy, please
Tell me about that movie. I like the king of comedy. I do. I really legitimately like it. I think I think mr
Pipkin
Is a good relatable protagonist man
It's not subtle. I wouldn't describe it as subtle. It's not subtle the most subtle movie that we saw was
They were never really here
Was that you were never really there I think that's what it is
I'm questioning my
It's not actually present most of the time. I was never not here
That's it. That's 100
Yeah, but that was subtler almost subtle to the point of where we were going like what? Yeah, sure. Um, you know
Yeah, it's very well i'm curious what in what way is he saying it's subtle that's all that's all I want to know
Some bad things. Hey, hey, hey, you know, guess what? You know, the b in subtle is subtle
Oh
I just fucking shit myself. Oh my god
So subtle I shit like just stare at the ceiling tonight where you can't get to sleep and think of that gem
That movie was never really titled ladies on your next date with that one
I
Want once the king of comedy is far more subtle and how it portrays a character like this
All the main characters are really they're really exaggerated it's not subtle
He's uh, like like so what comes to mind immediately is the shot where he is, uh
Standing at like a giant poster of hands like clapping and waving. I think it is
He's just standing in front of it like as if they're all for him
Then there's obviously the shot where he's with um, but what does it mean mauler?
Again again, i'm gonna do what rags just did
I actually really like king of comedy and I don't think that I would say a flaw of the film is that it's not subtle
I'd be like, no, no, it's just yeah because miss arthur rupor
pup pipkin
He's not a son of a guy. He wouldn't
While he's last name is
Living out shop while he's living out his fantasies
He has no reason to be subtle. It makes sense in the narrative that it wouldn't be subtle
Yeah in this conversation
That rupert is having with the lady that he likes. I forget her name. Her name is carla for this analogy
He's not subtle here either in fact
She is annoyed at how much he goes on and on and on about it
It's like he didn't watch this movie, but he did a long long time ago and he thinks he remembers it, right? But he doesn't
So speak with me
I just I think the film is very very clear about the kind of character rupert is and uh,
The subtlety is so i'm just going from the fact that you just he said that they're very subtle about the characterization
Yeah, he's not pumpkin isn't even an only one
It's uh that fangirl that fangirl character
They could have um, they could have had her just be a another because they had other
examples of fangirls around
The jerry character and they just they they hang on him and everything but the other one was crazy
And she was the main fangirl because pupkin and she know each other and she was far exaggerated
She's the worst of worst aspect of every delusional deranged ralo-esque fangirl you could ever encounter
Yeah, I would actually I would describe her as uh one-dimensional
Yeah, she's pretty she plays a crazy person. She's obsessed. She's the obsessive fangirl. That's all she is
He's just she's just a crazy person. Yeah that movie shit because she's not a three-dimensional character who's super fleshed out
Yeah, because I could be like she represents that
Idealizing idealizing celebrity is bad
Like she she represents the negatives of that and that's all the characters do in king of comedy that aren't
Rupert but that would be a disservice to a lot of the characters in king of comedy
Uh, like jerry jerry's a very interesting character. You get to learn a lot about him
Okay
Sure, we'll do it which yes
They beat him up all these which nations happen to him all at once the king of comedy is far more subtle in how it
King of comedy
Title drop pumpkin is a guy raised by he calls him pumpkin
It's weird how many people do it?
Pumpkin, but that's the joke is that he's names pippkin. What if what if he's what about if he's 3d?
Master chasing us right now and that's the joke is that he's getting his name wrong. Yeah, think about it
We fell for his 3d chess
Literally literally all of the 3d chess works because normally chess is only 2d
Mm-hmm
1d chess
1d chess
17 d chess. It's like one of those shitty flash games on e-bombs world. Oh my god. Remember e-bombs work
everybody
demonic defense to an ass hunter
Oh my god, I remember there's a flash i'm sorry, it's a little bit of an ass hunter but
The point is that his name is not pumpkin. It's pippkin
Maybe it's pumpkin
Trying to say the word pumpkin, oh my god it is
It's pumpkin
Pumpkin, it's okay. I really wasn't I was really not expecting to find a real game, but it is one
What you want to play some ass hunter?
Yeah, i'm not making this shit up. I'm still making sense. I'm still in control of my faculties
Ass hunter was a game where the gay people were trying to hump you but you had to shoot them and kill them first
And demonic defense too was a game where you had a castle and you had to click on enemies to kill them before they got
to your castle
Everyone's like goods you're ancient. It's like no i'm not I just remember this
A lot of people just don't remember e-bombs
I'm gonna play i'm gonna play ass hunter now
You're gonna play ass hunter? That is how to correctly spend your life
Stop letting me allow wait, let me run flash
Flash was blocked to this page. Let me not do that. Oh, there's gonna be flash in an ass hunter
You bet your bottom dollar there is
That was in the shirt regs
Let this poor man speak against
King of comedy
Rupert pumpkin is a guy raised by television. He's only used to watching artificial human behavior on talk shows very subtle
Yeah, no, yeah
Lincoln you miss fucking is recreating an entire tv set in his fucking house
In the scene that you're showing with your visuals ralph. It's so
subtle
What does it mean ralph? What doesn't even notice that he is almost painstakingly in an unhealthy way recreated a movie set
in his house
Ralph it's so subtle
What does it mean?
He doesn't actually interact with human beings because he doesn't have friends it works out for him. Well, I mean
I mean, I don't know that I would conclude that about him. He's pretty good at interacting with humans
It's only when he doesn't get what he wants
starts to crack
Yeah, when he when he goes into the television office place
He's normal. Like that's the thing about him. That's what's kind of so interesting
Is that he's totally normal when he's interacting with people even
Even on his date, right? He's he's kind of normal in the way that he talks
he's just but it's that one thing he obsesses over that
Really makes him stand out from a normal man, right?
Yeah, besides we don't know like how does he make money? There's so much of his life. We don't know
How does he pay the bills? Is his mom even?
a
Real is she even lives a figment of his imagination?
We don't even know there's so much we don't know about him, but he seems to be a normal well-adjusted person
Asterisk and this film is about that asterisk at the end of it
and
Yeah, he's like he's patient too. He's like willing to always sit down wait very calm very civil
It's just the with every conversation he has as it progresses. Like there's just this underlying like
You're not like a crazy person, right?
Yeah, and obviously we get insight into his head that he he has these crazy vivid imagination moments
Also, fuck me about subtlety
He gets he has his marriage on tv
Like he imagines his marriage taking place as a surprise on a tv show
That's the clip that ralph is playing. That's what that's what I mean. That's why it just hit me. I was like, it's not subtle
Come on. He's doing this. He's
Doing all of this while
While the guy he hated one of the guys he apparently hated who had enemies
Came up to him and says I would like to apologize to you and throw him the entire world. Yeah
Doing the wedding the guy who's doing the wedding it's like on how all of us who doubted you were so sorry, please accept our condolences
It's like ralph back to back plays like the two scenes that are the most non-subtle things
He does and it's like yeah, this room is great because it's so subtle. I just didn't understand what what did did did ralph pippkin?
Did ruper pippkin did he what does he really want in life? I'm just i'm baffled. What does he really want?
Bring in this movie the king of subtlety by this play. Come on
It's not a problem. I just find it fascinating you describe this as subtle. It's like, all right
How can you argue this move? This is good. This is a good movie
But how can you argue it has it's filled with all of this subtlety and not?
Put it put that argument in a parody video
again
That's that's a that's a digger for the like is this a parody video?
Survey says yes, but pretty sure it's not supposed to be
This is the most blatant of like all the movies we watch. I don't know is which is more
Which is more subtle?
This movie or falling down?
Um, we see this movie
So if the question is which one gives away what is going on inside the character's head more overtly? I would say it's this one
um
What I like I said about falling down
At first I think you could be convinced that he is your average guy who's just fed up with the world
But then you get all the the little bits and bobs about how he came to that point
Um, this is a little bit more complex and how he definitely at the end of the film
Regrets what he does
Like this probably wasn't the best course of action and that all he wants is to be with his family
That's he's desperate to just be with his daughter and his boy
I feel sad for him at the end like you legitimately feel like
You're like, oh man, this dude
Like something's going on and it's really fucked with him. I mean, that's too bad. I hope he doesn't
Yeah, wild pumpkin. I mean hope he doesn't get fucking shot off of pier. Yeah, that would be unfortunate if that happened
That would be tragic for this gentleman
But uh, yeah, all right. All right. Let's uh, yeah, let's keep going if you're on talk shows
He doesn't actually interact with human beings because he doesn't have friends
It works out for him with rita and you understand why she likes him. It works out for him with rita
It's not from with rita. No, it doesn't it calls it home at all. That's the fucking lie. Is he referring only to their date?
their first date
Because it doesn't really go it goes. Okay, like okay. Listen if if you
If she says do you want to come inside after you drop her off at your house? Your date's gone pretty good
All right. That's a success, right?
You've already done good, but like he but she thinks he's a psycho and a weirdo when he goes to
when he goes to um
TV man's house
um
Jerry yeah, it doesn't work out for him at all
Why does he not?
Why does he say that maybe well, so my quick take would be that he made a statement earlier saying that he doesn't have friends
He can't interact with people properly
And he knows that he does that very quickly in the movie when we meet him with rita and with jerry in the car
He's actually very capable of this and so he's probably maybe this is a form of backpedaling like yeah
Yeah, it works with rita. Okay, but that no because
Like I just don't think it was a particularly strong point in general
It doesn't like it sort of works with rita
but
Well, they go they're going off the fact that they knew each other in high school. I believe right she says
That's that's the only reason why she's giving him the time of day. She's like, oh, I know you hey something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
Yeah
Beings because he doesn't have friends it works out for him with rita and you understand why she likes him
You don't understand what a shot on language means
That's coast to coast national tv a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a whole lifetime
What are they eating? That was pretty deceptive. I mean he said it works out with rita showing a picture
Uh scene with him marrying her which is not actually occurring. It's a fantasy
If you hadn't seen the movie you might be tricked into thinking the
ends up marrying here
It's like that's not what happens in this movie
I'm getting more and more convinced that this is a parody and this can't be real
This can't be well, we can we can conclude that by the end if you want there'll be pieces of evidence to go
Yeah, both ways. The scenes are showing here is when they're like most getting along
Like this is like kind of the high point. It's beginning of the movie almost. Yeah. Yeah, sort of
um
But the reason I paused
Because I don't know what are they eating?
Like I can't I can't nail it down like it's food rags cheese american psycho-esque dishes
I feel like in the middle we have odd setup where you have like the raised plate with stuff in it
But like is this some kind of like like an indian place or something? It's a cling on delicacy. Yeah
Oh my god
All of this was more believable and interesting than what they do in this movie
you remember ralph when he has a a whole radio station and
Set up in his room and he pretends to run commercial breaks for himself being
Invited to a show that isn't real. You know how subtle that is
So subtle. I don't know what it means. Yes. Well, i'm glad i'm glad you managed to pick it up. You picked it up
I I had no idea I
Basically just added in because there's literally no other female characters in the movie that are interesting or fleshed out in any way
There's the joker's mother which is basically an exact copy
What his mother has with his mother in you were never really no, so that's a fucking lie
All right, because I saw you were never really here
And that's not true at all
Uh for context for those who have not seen that movie he does live with his mother and we will try and avoid
Spoilers, I suppose but um
She's in the movie for what I would say is about two minutes very little very little
She's not in the movie much very much a situation where she relies on walking phoenix and um, she's not all together there
uh in her head
But that's basically all we know
And he's almost like he's like resentful that he has to take care of her. Well, there is the aspect that uh
She and he were both, uh abused by the the father
And that may have caused like whatever whoever know like there's there's a lot to be um interpreted from details in that film but uh
It's much I find like this is the thing I feel like i'm it's almost like you're like, oh you're just trying to contradict it
Like the word I would use for joker's relationship with his mother is that it's much more fleshed out
Yeah, I mean just going by the time by the time times
He just gave us like two minutes and in joker the mother's like an integral part of the movie
And a big part of why he goes fucking insane in the end
Yeah, so the the plot goes the way it goes for her in um
uh
Joker is that she worked for
um the wane family
she adopted
uh
Arthur
she was
booted
from service from the wanes because of
Her mental faculties faculties, I believe i'd have to rewatch the specific scenes something along those lines and she
Got a boyfriend slash husband slash whatever partner that um was extremely abusive to arthur
and uh here
And uh the police were involved she got uh committed
He he was eventually committed. I don't know if that was from that age or once he was much older
And then once they were out, uh, they were still together
Uh, that's like the their history is is extremely important and then you see from the movie in present day
He's actually quite dismissive of him as well as she's like a combo of dismissive and loving depending on um
Different different parts to her the fact that she just says like you're not going to be a good comedian because you're not funny
She's kind of a jerk to arthur. She's kind of a and she's delusional, uh, or at least clinically delusional as the papers say
Yes
As we discover
Film progresses even though it takes place all at once
Eventually, we discover that she is
And so yeah
I would just conclude i'd be like there's so much more to her character than there is for this character in
You would never really there assuming I keep forgetting if I've got that name, right?
It's too hard for my brain to keep track of which of the ways i'm supposed to use
I'm gonna get reminded in chat every time I do this and i'm sorry, but it's uh, yeah, you were never really here
That's your opinion
Just staying or fleshed out anyway
also, he says that
There are no
Leshed out female characters. Um, and obviously the first one you would reference would be his mother probably and that's why he immediately says
Eh, just a clone of uh, the other movie. Didn't he say there are no fleshed out characters except for the joker seems kind of a
Oh like redundant thing to say
Yeah, I mean, I think you guys would agree right if you were to say a character is one-dimensional
They're not very
Characters there were none of them more wamans
I suppose I suppose you could be a flat. Can you be a fleshed out one-dimensional character?
No flesh out a women character
What uh was was the mother in the other movie was she flushed out
No, no
Would you call her flesh down? He's certainly less of a character than in joker
I I think that
I I hate to assign motivations to people
I kind of feel like
I feel like it's just blatantly not true because i've seen both these movies
mauler i'm just calling it mauler rags, but i'm
Thanks
Just stop drinking for a little bit you're never really here
and the mother in that
Is not at all like the mother in joker. No completely different
But if you're being broad if you're being nice and broad, she is a mother. She has mental issues and she
is old
If you're gonna but at the point at this point we're like broad to the point of uselessness
Well, that's how I feel about the comparisons. I always felt that that's just too broad. It's like
A condenser
I know right
There's literally no other female characters in the movie that are interesting or fleshed out in any way
There's also interesting when it goes to female exactly
satan
He talks about female characters. Why why is gabby female characters? Why he focuses on female characters?
What about just characters fleshed out female characters in 1917?
That is true
Yeah, women didn't exist back then
Physically just added in because there's literally no other female characters in the movie that are interesting or fleshed out in any way
There's that doesn't even make sense
Because there are no other female characters that that's not
That's not how that works
Like a fem an interesting female character was placed into the film because there are no other interesting female characters you'd be like
That's the reason why she's here. That's not even that's not anything
This film only has its one interesting plot because without it, that wouldn't be an interesting plot. Oh my god
Oh
Can't really do anything with that. It's like all right
Jerry is only in the king of comedy to give you know, the main characters some motivation
Gold. Oh, what is that? It's cheap. Oh
The camera's only running some scenes can happen
Oh, yeah, it's so often
Comedy is just about a guy who's obsessed with a celebrity. I mean who wants to watch that?
It's really cheap and dumb. You know what I mean
The movie that are interesting or fleshed out in any way there's the joker's mother
Which is basically an exact copy of the relationship he has with his mother in you were never really here except the
I mean, uh, I I don't want to say too much for the sake of spoilers
But let's just say their relationship all of you very different chat. You've seen these movies. You know, that's wrong and
You will see these movies and as you do you will be like, you know what?
That thing Ralph said that one time
How's the fucking lie?
Rags how many beers have you had?
One is it one? No, it's not one
Two
One half
In the room and she's oh my oh my god, it's the guy from next door
And right there
It's obvious what happened. Oh he imagined the relation. Yeah. Yeah, so that's the point
Reveal
We all know where this is going this is one of the most parroted criticisms of joker that uh
They show you this and a smart person figures this out
But a dumb person may not and so they show flashbacks to all the scenes that she was in where she's not in them anymore
And that that means the film is bad because that's a whole
Six seconds that could have been cut from the film
But they didn't when when they're blowing up alderon
They're like fire the weapon at alderon and then you see alderon blow up
Man a waste of time
So, yeah, I guess that kind of highlights the counter because i'm assuming that's where he's going I could be
Totally off base, but I just that's what I remember
um
the the idea they're being like
If though if there was an hour spent with characters talking about how she was an illusion like there's just an hour
They're like she's not real. She's not real. No, she's not everything she was in not really there
Flashback flashback loads of papers saying used to talk about how she was there
But she's not flashback and then another character getting saying how was that relationship going turns out she's not real
Oh my god, I'd be like jesus christ. I get it
Okay, but this we're literally so I was actually surprised on the rewatch, uh with the flashbacks
Because i've seen so many videos talking about how excessive it is and then it lasts
I want to say six seconds. I could be underestimated. Let's just say 10 for the sake of argument. That is even a tiny portion of the film
It's ridiculous again. I agree. I think if you thought the flashbacks the film would be stronger but like
It's six seconds of runtime. This is the one criticism that you like that is fair. You did it
I kind of I like I don't know that it's definitive
Yeah, I I like them because when they happen
It's kind of it follows right after you learn
That she's just like she's been hallucinated by arthur, right?
So right after you get that and you're still kind of riding that high of the reveal
It's it's kind of showing you that she wasn't ever really there. I think it works and it doesn't like
anything and it's a big signal that he's realizing it too
And um, it gives us a little bit more time to sit with the actual fact of it, which um
Is more important than maybe realized?
uh, that I I would say in terms of um
You you have to think about those scenes for a moment and what she says in each of them to him
And about the events because it's actually him that's saying all of it
It's actually like so just just off the top of my head, right?
Like she says that uh, she she tells him he's funny when when they first meet
So now we know that that's him telling himself that
And uh, his mother ad was confirmed to have narcissistic tendencies or or personality disorders was just like oh god
It's clearly translating
Uh to him as well in the scene with looking at the paper
She describes what he did as kind of like heroic and awesome because he there's three less
Three less assholes in the world. I think she says that's clearly what he thinks
That he he doesn't feel guilt for killing them. He feels good about it
I find that very interesting in terms of a recontextualizing
Of the of the dialogue. It's like it's no longer her perspective. It's his
Um, and so yeah, I just think that it's it's a moment that could be like you can give it time to breathe just a little bit
It's kind of like seeing that that scene in fight club where you find out tyler durden is spoiler alert
The same guy is edward norton, right? But that's a film that you're not allowed to criticize. So people say it's okay
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's okay. It's okay there. It's okay when fight club did it. Yeah, and for the record
I like it in both of them. But uh, oh, yeah
Fantastic author. He's my one of my favorites
Anyway
She shipped with her I guess that makes sense because he's a weirdo but then because no he's not a yes, but that's kind of reductive
I
Feel like it's kind of
This movie is made for the 14 year olds who thought batman versus superman was a ground and then because this movie was made
so
What?
We're in trouble now because he just described this movie was made 14 year olds like oh 14 year olds. What?
14 year olds. Okay, so if you like this movie in any way you're you're just an immature 14 year old
He said it was made 14 year olds
Your opinion is meaningless, I guess that's what he's trying to get at
Again again, you're you're another your opinion is meaningless argument. Fantastic
Gosh, why I can't imagine why so many people didn't like this video
Maybe it's because because he calls him 14 year olds if they like I think it's because that fucking stupid children
They are stupid children. That's that's what it is. This would be a throws popcorn moment at this video
Someone is asking what I'm eating. I will answer you because
Because it's up. So this i'm having
A london broil, right? That's sick. I would like to think i'd like to thank mauler and his people
for making london broil
I think it's just a cut of the animal. It was very good. It's very cheap. It's you can do a lot with it
It's like right. It's like the the rice of meat
Right do a lot with it
I made all of it at once and I whatever I didn't have
I cut up the whole thing. Yeah, put it in the fridge so I can have it later
There you go. Chat. We made it for you. Right me and my people it's so good though. Could you do anything with it?
Occasionally I have no people check it in the fridge and just chill it and just have a little bite here and there
Is that your last name?
Go ahead. Oh my god
Thank you mauler. My last name is soylo. Yes. Soylo
mauler is well
Pronounced wailish, but yeah, yeah world. He's a weird world
Because this movie is made for the 14 year olds who thought batman versus superman
Was a grump and then because this movie was made for the same demo as the people smooth video so bitter
He's so angry and upset
Like 10 minutes
Like ralph
Ralph is angry that people really like this ralph when he was googling the news
And he can't he he heard that joker's getting all these
Awards, he's googling news switched to
And he was fine. He found out that joker got all these awards. He was pissed. He was mad
He must have been super upset
That oh, I just can't believe it
You have some spaghetti. I don't know how mad he was when that joker made like a what a billion dollars
Oh, well, no, it goes further than that the oscar nominations people went nuts. They were like fuck this this movie is a
Child nominatid idiot nonsense meaningless boo
That uh, the 11 nominations gave me life. It was fantastic
Also a couple people saying in chan I think it's fair to bring it up at this point his audio is strange in this video
Yes
What's wrong with it? Just um different it feels like different parts of it recording at different times in different ways
A lot of them are cut harshly
There's a couple of pops like uh, he's he's usually pretty good with audio
That's that's the thing. I think people the reason why people bringing it up want to cut ralph harshly. Oh my god
No, I that was
I mean in a video game
Uh, I think I should leave
You're spooking satan rags
Opinions of rags do not reflect the opinions of the other
No, nor do they reflect the opinions of satan
Plicing sarcasm the words of rags do not affect the opinions of rags the words of rags do not affect the opinions
As if you want to know why I re-recorded so much of my first video that i'm doing right now
This is basically how it sounded at some places. So i'm like different person. Wow
Record it. Look at melby. Look i'm better than ralph the movie maker. Yeah, okay. All right, buddy. Yeah
Seeing this i'm pretty confident to be honest
However many subscribers he has you're a subscriber of life i'm not well
I don't like life's newsletter. You don't oh, they're great, dude. They have like
Yeah, they talk about like things loads of it all of the fuck. I love those
You know, what's really weird about the batman suit there?
Is that if you're gonna make a big batman armor suit, why did you not have anything over your mouth?
Why are you not covering that up? Maybe there's something retractable that can come over it
Just someone could just shoot you in the oil and shoot you in the mouth and all that armor ain't worth shit now
Is it how would superman know that he's frowning if he had something over his mouth, right?
There's also you could draw a little frown on there with a pen what
There's also no cover over his butthole. Oh my god
So he just poops inside you're supposed to pipe with that suit on you need a butthole
He has a bat flap at the bottom and that cod piece he's got there just lifts up
Anyway
Because this movie was made for the same demo as the people who liked batman versus superman
We need to cut to flashbacks that show that she wasn't actually there and spell it out to the audience
Oh my god, this guy I think is so bad
So what is bad about it? So you got a guy being like he's being nice to you that look at the guy
I'd look it back. Um
They're all drunk. They're all drunk. So
It's like it's fine
Yeah, are you gonna criticize?
My writing this video reminds me of when like people realized they could get a million views for saying anything bad about brie larson
So it was like wow look at this interview footage of brie larson
Next next to her chris hamsworth raises his eyebrow clearly. This means she's committed genocide
I knew it
That is true though. She did probably haven't been in a video game
Like don't happen we all
Yeah, we did establish that bad about this writing in the senior. Tell
Tell me why I need to know
I was gonna say like
These points not only are they very thin, but they're not even qualified
Like what do you mean in comparison to what like why that's just like it's just bad. It's just bad
Oh my god, the acting is so bad don't ignore me he's being nice like
cartoon characters
That's the thing with the tone of this film. Is it trying to be realistic?
It feels like it's set in like some grand kind of dceu
But if you're trying to make a real film
What is it? No, it is. What is it?
Not that is not what they're going for at all. You mean what when silver can't follow
Tell her who's about to think
Well does anyone we can replay that if you want more because
I think we all disagree
He's just the guy's acting is bad
But he doesn't really point out why it's bad like what he could have done this or he his inflection was wrong
Is it he just he just mocks him in a goofy fashion? That's that's all his criticism. Oh my god
This criticism is so bad. I'm not acting so bad
Ralph you're acting is bad in this video. Ralph. Yes
Ralph pretend pretend that you are the director and you're on the site scene
side
You're on set set you're on set
And all of the characters and actors are doing their thing and you yell cut cut cut cut cut and everyone stops because you're a director
and then you say
You did a bad job, right? You didn't do good
What Ralph if you were in the director shoes?
Tell us right? What would you?
Tell the actors if you wanted them to do better. You wouldn't just tell the actors. No, no that would shit do it again
It's like no
like
Tell your actors why?
Tell him what your vision is. Tell him I guess he thinks it's obvious want them to do I I guess he does
But here's the thing. It's not
Any idea what he's talking about?
Right, obviously you go up to the actor and then just mock what they just said in a goofy fashion
But they said oh he's messing with you. Oh, he's messing with you do it better. That's what you do
They fly now
Obviously flying out it feels like it's set in like some grand kind of dceu
But if you're trying to make a weird thing is I didn't I thought he knew this but this film was actually designed to be standalone
standalone
What evidence did he did he see that gives him the impression that it's supposed to be part of a grand dceu?
We saw that video by spring crush. Oh my god, that that's it all fits together. That video appears in this video. It's all yeah
Wait what yes
so there's a video that I responded to
where
someone makes the argument that
Joker is clearly a part of the dceu. It's a really bad video
And my video responding to that is in this video
So it all links together. Oh my god, it's a real
It's the youtube cinematic universe. I want to clarify he said a real film you describe
Is it not film is a real film?
Like taxi driver red guy in the back seat of the taxi
Just goes on and on and on to some random stranger about how he's going to murder his wife with a 44 magnum
and in stuff
Yeah, like a real film
But if you're trying to make a real film like an art film
Then throwing in these connections to like an art film and having these cartoonish characters. Why would you say that say dumb
cartoon, they're very drunk
They're young they're young men who are
Like have you ever gone out
Have you ever been with people like having fun time?
Have you ever gone outside? Have you ever?
Not been with your dog at your fireplace at christmas
Have you ever like done stuff? This is a very realistic scene
This is how people can be people can be silly and sometimes they can be a little bit aggressive
They can come on a bit too strong
Sometimes they are not very self-aware about how they're behaving in front of other people
I understand
That irony could be applied to that but this is how people are this is very relatable in a realistic scene
This is how people are they speak in a vulgar way not like rude
But like vulgar and like from latin volga, you know, like in the common tongue colloquially, right?
This is very relatable scene. It's not wrong with this. This is how people actually behave, bro
Yeah
I mean get off social media for a little bit where they don't we they don't have filters anymore
And listen to how actual people speak and not only these people are are they young and drunk?
They're also rich
They have a lot of money to spend and they have all the time in the world on their hands
Yeah, they call what are they I can't remember if they were called like investment bankers or something like that
They they do say in the phone for Wayne
We're for Wayne some they win enterprises. Yes
Um, and yeah, I just want to highlight elvic in chat said Warner Brothers didn't even finance the entire film themselves
It was low low budget comparatively. It wasn't changed for china. It's r-rated
There's no merch ralph is completely off base about it being like, you know designed to be interconnected or whatever
Yeah, well he was asking is this film supposed to be sorry that's too deep for rel
Is this film supposed to be realistic?
And i'm thinking what's like what's unrealistic about it? Like that's the thing. He says it
This is a claim and it's pretty it's a pretty big one, too. Is like is film trying to be realistic?
What was unrealistic about it? Tell me
I because I think it's fairly grounded believable kind of film
And dialogue like is something funny
It takes me a dump dialogue is something funny asshole
A lot of people will say that verbatim. Okay. Yes
If someone is laughing at you, would you say the words is something funny asshole absolutely when you're drunk
I can vouch for this people have said this to me a lot
People actually say this
Yeah, if you go out in public and start laughing
Around or at a bunch of people a bunch of guys in a group who have been drinking a bit. They're gonna ask
Something funny asshole
It's just like a normal thing. It's a really normal piece of dialogue. Yeah, it's a staple hostile phrase. Okay
Ralph tell us what they should have said that wasn't clunky. Tell them if you were a director
If if they said something funny asshole
And you would say cut cut cut cut and they stopped the director
What would you have said? No, no, you need to say this. This is what people say
It's not that tell me ralph. Don't just tell me it's wrong. Now. Don't tell me why just too much of
you
Sir
Create itself
By northern end of a southern bound swine
There was a suggestion chat you have it a laugh bruv. That's what he should have said
Real life isn't sanitized. Okay, it's not so they're gonna get banned real life. Dude real life isn't well written
It's not sanitized it's real life is ribbed for your pleasure. Okay, that's what real life. Oh my god
But even satan said that so
You know, it's true movie completely it's not realistic if you want to be like metaphorical with this stuff
Why would you say that why would you say
It's not realistic if you want to be
Metaphorical he's like which do you want ralph? Well, he I think he's saying he's he's
Uh, he's drawn out that it it's not realistic
So therefore it can only be metaphorical and if you want to be metaphorical, I think that's his through line. He just sort of
Took over it. But uh, I I'm I'm I'm bothered by the
Asshole is a metaphor. They're not actually an asshole. I'm bothered by the skipping over
Because a hole isn't even anything
You're like, what is a hole? It's like it's more like a like a gap in something really
I don't think he's specifically referring to that line as a metaphor
But like i'm still blocked all the way back at like why is he canceled out that this could be realistic?
What was what made it so that it had to be defined people don't say the word asshole or ask if things are funny
Yeah, i'm i'm lost i'm stuck all the way back at that
Like I said, tell us what they should have said ralph. You are a movie maker
After all tell us what they should have can't believe he can say this without it as being a parody
This is over and over again
He fooled us
It's like no I was only pretending to be retarded
Yeah, if just turned out to be parody that is uh, that would be the case
Yeah, well, like I said, we don't lose because we're countering these arguments as if they're real anyway
Because a lot of people do make these arguments. So it's all good. All of this is but I actually I think the reality is much more
Depressing for him in that his audience are trying to defend it would be like it's parody and he's like
I mean
I guess his audience didn't get it if this is parody. It's
That's the thing. In fact, it was too subtle in his parody. I yeah, I should clarify that that's kind of
Unfeared because a lot of his audience did not actually feel that this was a parody. A lot of them were very upset with this video
And the new thing to do now
Wait, wait, it's click if if the if this is just supposed to be a parody
The why disabled people watching it on outside of youtube?
Why why disabled we play on external sites if it's just parody, right? Or a bait or something
Kind of weird kind of weird
Yes strange
Strange movie completely. It's not realistic if you want to be like
Metaphorical with this stuff like you got to be more subtle and the new thing to do now. Yeah, subtle
King of comedy. Yeah, king of comedy subtle. Okay
When someone gives an opinion you don't like is to say oh well, yeah get called out jay
Yeah
Joker review
The thing to do now when someone has an opinion that you don't like is to say they're wrong
Yeah, this this falls back on him immediately. Doesn't it? He's like this is just dumb that you're doing this
Like well, is that what you're doing?
Isn't he rejecting the notion of a bad take right? Like is he saying those are impossible?
Well, then just surely by that logic
He's saying your take is bad to have a take that says another take is bad, right?
No, shut up
Like what i'm saying is this this cascades because you can't say I can just I could this is why it works forever
I should be like it's just my opinion about your opinion
So you can't say that my opinion is I can't have an opinion on your opinion being a bad opinion because that's my opinion
So infinite if you go to joker on youtube movies
how come
Joker ends in quotation marks, but doesn't have one in the beginning of it
What oh, yeah, what is that a oh, that's weird. He's making typo on their own movie. Yeah, I think that's a typo
Oh my god, hopefully they've uh, they'll oh don't they well, they obviously watch our show. So now they know there you go guys
That's out of character youtube wouldn't make a mistake. No
Fun fun idea fun fact the the quotation mark used to be there and then youtube released a helpful update where they removed it
Oh, that is yeah, that sounds like youtube. We removed a thing. That was correct
also, I think uh now it's been revealed that the title of the stream may have been influenced by uh,
Ralph the movie maker has a bad take on the joker
Who's talking about right?
Uh, so makin is one of his characters. I believe this is what someone told me
And that this is a fake obviously upload fake video. He's pretending to have done on himself with his like parody character
But we're now making it a reality and 12 minutes and 47 seconds. That is weak sauce
I'm genuinely curious if this is supposed to be a shot at me or not because like i'm doing the thing that he's bitching about
Right. I I mean it has to be right. Like I don't I don't think it was
Deliberately aimed at you. He just searched for that and then
Is there no, I mean you personally more so the idea you're just the one that was there, you know
So like i'm sure this shot is aimed at all all five of us
For example, like not just you if you type in bad take joker review j your video is on top
Yeah, I just want to clarify this video also comes up as one of the first results
I want to clarify that j is the problem not us
You see j is the one that's been making giving if have a bad name as as ralph has just pointed out
He is the bad tism i'm glad we've uh
We've highlighted this
Yes
The movie maker. He has a bad take his take. It's just a bad take. I want to delve into the metaphors
Yeah, it is a bad take. Well, yeah
I would like to have him on here and I would ask him
Is it possible to have a quote unquote bad take and if he says no
Then i'd start giving what I would assume a ubiquitous bad takes and just see how long it takes for him to define. Okay
Yeah, okay. Fine that and what does he have room to stand on this?
I mean this entire video so far even if it's only been four minutes has been him going over and saying
You see this acting that's bad acting moving on
See this class moving on cgi. It's bad. Let's just do an example, right? So it's bad
Uh rags rags, let's play this out. All right, so, um, I don't like joker
Find out why I don't like joker
Um, ask me why ask me what what am I playing you're playing yourself. Fuck it. Am I playing if i'm playing me?
Yeah, you're playing
Fine play ralph and you don't believe there's such a thing as a bad take
Okay
So ask me why
Okay, oh, all right because I just thought was ralph believe in that
um
What am I supposed to ask you so i'm saying?
I think joker is a bad don't ask me why
Why do you think joker's why do you think joker's are bad?
Well because the a lot of the marketing showed the working phoenix was in the movie
He's barely in it like most of the film is about robert deniro's stupid show or about his mother or about
All these tertiary characters like you see him for what like five minutes in total
Like I really didn't even get to know him at all and it's like oh, yeah, it's all character study. That's nonsense
He's barely in it. Plus you can tell where the cuts are
Who's j playing?
Your conscience I suppose
Oh my conscience in this case. I don't even know
The point is that ralph would be like, okay
No, that is a bad take and then you go why and he's like because you could definitively prove that
Joker is walking phoenix is in most of the movie and i'd be like, ooh
So we can prove stuff, huh?
I almost died here fucking that's the shittiest role play I ever did
Yeah, you you tried what I was supposed to do after after I asked you what's so bad about it
I don't even know what I was supposed to do. We were improv. I guess there was no script. I'm sorry
I'm supposed to say well
That's not well
That's the thing if i'm trying to get some mind of ralph
I guess ralph would say like are you sure you're talking about the right movie?
Because I think you could be mistaken
And then you would say something along the lines of oh
But I did see the right movie joker 2019 walking phoenix that one
So are you saying that there is such thing as a bad take and then you would then force?
Ralph to take either the position that bad takes do exist
But that would mean that what he said earlier was not correct or for the sake of
Consistency he would have to adhere to his previously stated bad position and then agree
That it's not a bad take for you to say that walking phoenix was only in five minutes of the movie
Even though it can be objectively proven that he was in the movie. What's longer than that nailed it. See
I don't think he believes that there's no such thing as a bad take
I just don't think that he thinks he has like he thinks that he just has an opinion and that there's nothing that you can
Say, but no about
Um, okay. Yeah, I think he thinks that what he's doing is equivalent to saying no, I just didn't like it very much
Well, I don't think that he thinks he has a bad take
Right, like no one thinks they have a bad take or they would have another take probably. Yeah
Yeah, but it's more like the capability of him having a bad take like it's it's kind of
Uncurt like he can't believe that he could have a bad take on joker because to him
So clear right like when he made this movie and he put it film video
when he made this
Video i'm sorry. I do this all the time
Someone's youtube video and I call it like a movie or a film. I don't mean to
When joker made this video, okay
It's at least my sins
um when
Ralph made this I think that he thought this would be well received. I guess is it hubris? I disagree the amount of
Comments he's put in this video
Like he he may as well have said in this video. This will not be well received
Like he kind of does in other words, but it's like then why do it like if he knew it well
No, you bring him a good point
And uh, I just heard the next part of this and I remember this line
Just just watch this clip we're about to we're about to get to because I remember this
I want to delve into the metaphors and allegories of parasite you call joker
so
He's saying as like an exhaustive sort of point about doing all of this. I would rather be talking about parasite and it's like
Go talk about it and do it
Yeah, talk about parasite. That's a great movie. Go talk about a film that you you know about
Yeah, you're passionate about
and so say
This is the thing like it
Feels to me like he forced himself to make this video
And that's why it's come out so wonky because he's like never try to force it out or you'll end up with shit
Oh, oh, yeah, you know jay knows about that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I shut myself earlier on this stream exactly and
Probably recently again, you never know
Oh, yeah
You know, it's hard to tell if it's the same shit as before if there are if there's more than there was earlier
Yeah, also he says that by the way and you expect him to go on but it just cuts
Well, it feels like it's a harsh audio cut to the next point
It's very look at what I mean about the strange sort of structure
Ligori is a parasite. That's great. You call joker corny. Meanwhile, you watch mr
Robot, which is way cornier, you know, mr. Robot has like dimensional characters in it. That's psychiatrist character. Mr. Robot
I like
Mr. Robot, so I haven't watched it. I like the label dimensional characters as in characters with either between one or more dimensions
It takes a genius to make a character with one more dimension
I can't even know there can be a character without at least one
Krista and mr. Robot. She actually like does things in the plot. She has a life outside of our main characters
So without having all these people have lives without having watched mr. Robot, that is a tv show
Uh tv show they get a lot more time than a movie
You can dedicate entire episode to a tertiary character if you wanted to
Don't just have that luxury. It's a movie
And there are pragmatic realities you have to account for and he needs to
Highlight which of the characters needed to be more than what they were in joker
And then you need to clarify why they needed to be more like, uh, tell me which and why
Story that one is an equivalent criticism to just saying oh, there were no spaceships
Well, I I think it's a legitimate criticism that the guy who pulled the lever and pressed the buttons to activate the death star
Was not giving more character. Who wrote that song who wrote it? Tell I did it was me
Why super mode super mode? They're the ones who made that song
Tell me why tell me why is the song because someone said tell me why and then I think I said
In that I was thinking of the song
And I was like who made the fucking song because the album has the um, it has the motorcycle helmet on the front
The red one like who makes that fucking song? It's super mode. They made the song. Tell me why
So thank you rags. Thank you. Let's proceed
Krista and mr. Robot. She actually does things in the plot. She has a life outside of our main character's story
She has a personality in this movie. What does the psychiatrist character do? Oh, she just regurgitates what the themes of the movie are
They don't give a shit about people like you are there. No, she only does it because she's brought to a breaking point
She is a therapist. She's not motivated about what she does
She is clearly going through the same problems that he is to a different degree
Maybe she's not a lot of money. She's living in gotham too
As the the first scene in the film is arthur fleck and he's sitting down and he's applying his makeup, right?
And the radio man he's talking about he's setting up this stuff for later, right?
He's talking about how the trash is impacting everybody rich and poor. Everybody's getting affected by the trash. So that's her
She's living in gotham. She's got to go through all these problems and then once she's go
She's going to get fired. Anyway, she just flat out says it to him. She has hit her point
She's like a little it's weird
She's like a little mini joker right where she's got all the problems and bad stuff happens to her
And she this is like a little breaking point for her, right?
She's been fired they cut the funding and she just outright says it arthur. They don't give shit about you
Give a shit about me
She's being honest with him and I think that's a really kind of human thing to do. Dare. I say it
It adds a bit of dimension to her character
I know I said I was gonna say she's not someone I would highlight a single dimension when she you can
You can tell she's she's she's listening to him and she's like this guy thinks that like everyone's out to get him
Does he know that all of us are going through shit right now? Yeah, man
Oh like there are scenes
In the movie also the the highlight
About this stuff man
The highlight we have from the other podcast where someone's like she's not actually like a uh, professional therapist
She's a social worker filling in for the job or the role like she has that badge to show that they're stretched thin
So like she may not even be qualified for the job that she's necessarily having to perform or least completely. I think the whole point was that she wasn't
So yeah, like there's a lot of the whole point she he like arthur wasn't
Getting the help and support that he needed and it was taken away despite
And it was taken away. Yeah, the whole fucking argument here is so terrible
It's literally just the therapist character isn't as fleshed out as another therapist
You know what that therapist probably isn't as fleshed out as another therapist from somewhere else
There was only one most fleshed out therapist
Chat the chat said but we'd need a scene of her at the supermarket, right?
It's true
It's what the themes of the movie are they don't give a shit about people like you arthur
And they really don't give a shit about people like me
Society doesn't care about you. Society doesn't care about me. Uh, blah blah blah blah blah
If every character was this just a very skilled
That was a very mature way to explain to me how uh, the film is failing
You think you would think that being a 14 year old?
I would find that very funny
Very uninsightful, I feel like you could do it was better insightful
Full of unsightliness
Asshole for no reason that I wouldn't watch the show. Oh ralph. You just don't get it
I mean for no reason higher ending was a dream. That's like the go-to
How was that response to anything you just said what does that have to do with what he was talking about?
The therapist is the therapist doesn't have enough character. You don't get it. The ending was a dream
What
Did your wisdom video missing between those two points?
I don't yeah, i'm not sure how to respond to that textbook fan theory when a movie's over
It's like joker had dreamlike logic even though every movie has dreamlike logic
Thomas does it well does every every movie have maybe what does he mean by dreamlike logic?
Yeah, like do you mean it's like to in to some degree romanticized like a th white novel
Anyone jay satan mel. What does he mean by dreamlike logic usually dreamlike is like surrealism, isn't it?
So like something happening that shouldn't necessarily be possible
And we get to like alice kind of like a tangible version of that might be some alice and wonderland stuff
But this really happened with joker. He's more like it goes from real world to psychotic breaks
It is there's no dreamlike logic throughout the movie. Why did he show him get into the fridge? Is he trying to say that like that's not?
awesome
He might still be clinging on to our hallucination thing that he
Imagined the whole relation thingy. It's like oh, that's all the dream
If you if you were doing dreamlike logic surely you would use a different reference than him getting into a fridge
Yeah, well don't get into a fridge in real life. You only get to
Maybe ralph always just dreams of being inside fridges. The fridge
The fridge is too cold. You can't get in there. Stop it
What I feel like what happened is he's like, oh there was people that said that said it's all the dream
So let me get those weird scenes out of the movie. See that's dreamlike
Some people just drown themselves at the bottom of a bottle. Ralph just freezes himself inside of that
I don't think that joker was a dream at the end and here's why
so
So at the end, right we see the scene of the clown
Man, not joker the other clown but the writer man
He shoots
Thomas way spoiler alert. He shoots
The spam is a back metal killed him and then
Amateur sex video. I prefer amateur sex videos. Actually. I like them when they're I like that. I don't they seem so fake
Like they're not even really into it if they're professional. They just don't
The spammers said society doesn't care about jews fact
I don't know. I don't know about that. I couldn't fix that mods kill those
people
But the ending of joker isn't a dream because the writer
She shoots thomas wayne
But he kills the wife too
If this was all a dream by arthur fleck, why would the man kill thomas wayne's wife?
She hadn't done anything bad. She hadn't done anything to joker
She hadn't done anything and we have multiple instances
Of him sparing people because they were nice to him and they hadn't offended him or wronged him in any way
So why would he all of a sudden randomly break from this consistent rule that he'd be following?
It doesn't make any sense. You see it doesn't make any sense, right?
so
There you go
People putting little dog and bear emojis in the chat. Oh, you also said false. Dun dun dun
Oh my god
What what parts false? I don't actually i'm not sure
Maybe um, but also the fact that we even see that happening
He's like why would that be part of the dream sequence if he wasn't even there to this seems weird. I don't know kind of odd
But I think in any case how about your sex videos?
Yeah
Those are great. Just put one in the watch together
Yeah, because I don't know about you
But like the ones that look really really professional where the chick is like obviously a super
Mega hot person and the guy's like this
Stud it's just like that's not real. That's all fast food commercials where you're like, you know
It's not actually going to look like that like in falling down. It's dream logic. Oh my god
We're referencing falling down which is putting the amateur porn video in the watch together. We appreciate the subtlety of the storytelling
Dude railing some chick right
That's subtle. It's that subtle is the king of comedy the way the jizz catches the qualities of the light when it streams. Oh, yes
Is it flows to the air as it's being shot when he says something about ugly people the way the jizz refracts the quality of the moonlight
Oh, no
Logic even though every movie has dreamlike logic thomas wayne. I mean bruce wayne's father
Who's just a cartoonish dickhead punch a joker in the face?
He's not a cartoonish cartoonish. You remember what happened. Oh boy. All right
Okay, he's pretty frustrated by that point the fucking randy starts laughing at you
At that point we just put his fingers in your child's mouth and strangling your butler
Have just played hands on his son
And almost threatened to actually he started choking out for the death
He just let go because he realized what he was doing
And then you suddenly see this man who assaulted your butler and your son in the bathroom with you daddy
Yeah
Yeah, he says like you're my dad don't lie to me
And he actually shouts it up at one point and then he starts overtly laughing at him and obviously thomas wayne doesn't know that's a condition
Yeah, um, and I want to I want to clarify
That me and rag's a bit more than aware of this argument from lots of videos and uh upon rewatching something. I completely forgot
After he punches him as he leaves the room. He says don't ever lay hands on my son ever again
Yeah, yeah, he says basically if you ever touch my son again, i'll kill you. Yeah
It's a father
Protecting his son from a creepy
Weirdo of his son. Well, you don't like what an asshole just putting their body parts in your child's mouth. What a cartoon
And like I have to say
That like i'm willing to bet it's just incompetence but come on ralph like
You cut the before and after away like
Not cool, dude
And why is he doing this he's gonna prop up king of comedy
He's gonna say king of comedy did this but better after creating a straw man out of joker's characters. It's like not cool bad
hit with newspaper
Who's just a cartoonish dickhead punch a joker in the face jerry langford was way more
Of realistic and how he dealt with rupert jerry
But these are different characters
And different characters with different contexts and different exactly these are in the films for different amount of time
I don't remember a pumpkin ever like
Laying on his son. I don't remember a pumpkin ever laying hands and on
Jerry's son and I don't remember a pumpkin ever strangling his his secretary or something
No, because those things don't happen
And you know what's funny is at one point pumpkin gets what you could call violently thrown out of the building
Yeah, kind of
Yeah in the security they they do forcibly removing from the build
Right so the only thing that these two things I mean they're two
Males wearing clothes speaking in english to each other
Are we getting broad again are we getting broad
I just feel like one's not
I mean it's basically a rip off of one another because when the two males speaking english on the planet are talked to each other
No, it like never happens ever and however not once never happened. Well, it happened in king of comedy and in joker
I don't know that rip off. Yeah
but for those of you
For those of you who have not seen king of comedy the king of comedy
The king of comedy
This is not anything like the bathroom scene in joker
at all in the bathroom
Not even in a bathroom
I mean
I say the world's your bathroom. I'm a dog
Also, this also this is the beginning scene like the first time they meet they're actually
Good there because he helps him get into his car and they talked a little bit
I mean the the the talk show guy was a little bit annoyed, but at the end it's like yeah, sure
Whatever get us some tapes or whatever. Thanks
Wouldn't it be great if in the bathroom scene just like as it was getting really intense in the background you heard
Yeah, no. Yeah, that's better than what I was going to say
Just pull out their dicks start pissing on each other. I love
You just like me
Well, I got some people waiting for me I really don't know what my schedule is maybe we can okay
Take it go ahead. Take it. Yeah, this is uh
When he's faced and it's when he starts to first get impressions that rupert isn't entirely normal because he keeps pushing him
So it's it's good scene because I like this movie. It's very it's very well put together. I enjoy this joke consider it a gift
It'll work for you
I will nothing you need to help
Jerry seriously, you ever want lunch my treat
We keep pausing for the safety of the string. It's all good. So yes. All right, you never know copy tisms
Also, yeah ralph got hit with copyright on this video at some point so i'm just gonna be extra careful because I don't know
Yeah, this seems like a pretty long scene I can could imagine that this
Okay, okay
Okay, jerry who's getting pissed on metal?
Oh, sorry
Yeah
Jerry
Jerry reveals later that he's like the only reason that he was being nice to him is because he wanted him to fuck off
Basically, it's just like yep, you definitely get that impression
Meanwhile, oh, well, that's fair. Look at that comparison
Wow
This isn't a sleazy edit in any way whatsoever these scenes are exactly alike
Same
Show the beginning of a you didn't even show their conversation
Yeah
We show the beginning of of their relationship in king of comedy to this where it's already escalated. It's like oh cool. Yeah, good job
Yeah, how about if I what have I showed?
Punching people in the face. What I should do is show a clip of joker and him having it back and forth
Like arguing about the situation saying like see this is a really great character
And then look at king of comedy and I show a pupkin getting thrown out of the building and i'm like, oh, yeah
Okay, that's it. Cool
Yeah
And then like I cut to another piece of like jerry shouting at him in his house being like why are you in my house?
I'd be like see terrible
But then how is joker supposed to look bad if he does that?
Oh shit, fuck
It's almost like fucking bullshit
Okay, remember
I just did
Just continue. I'll say something mean
You wouldn't know
I'm listening. He talked to my son through an iron gate jokers. Yeah, talk to us because he talks to my son through an iron gate
I just said I was gonna say something mean
God damn it ralph you piece of shit
Listen like this is being a fucking liar
Oh, yeah, ralph lying to you. This is ralph. Lying at this point is the charitable interpretation
This is ralph
Lying to you. This is ralph being very very deceptive
Very very deceptive ralph doesn't show the fact that this stranger just walked up to the gate and put his fingers in my son's mouth
He didn't show the part where this weirdo dude. He just put his fingers in my son's mouth started strangling my butler
Don't show that don't show that
Say something play a clip of something semi-relevant and then just go to the next scene
Just go to the next scene. Just don't even talk about it. Fuck you. Ralph. You're a liar
Apparently according to ralph if someone puts his fingers in your son's mouth and you punch him out
That's being a cartoonish dickhead. Yeah, I almost am like if you didn't punch this guy
Like arguably being a piece of shit if you didn't punch a guy putting his fingers
There are lots of acceptable reactions to it. If you don't try to stop him, then yeah, you're being a piece of shit. Yeah, uh
People get very protective of their children. I don't know why that is. I can't figure it out myself
No idea why would you want to protect your kin child huff spring
cartoonish asshole ralph told me because only silly cartoonish assholes protect their children
Ralph's are calling written ralph is a poorly written character. I don't believe that any real person would be this stupid
Yeah, that's why I keep getting the parody vibes a cartoon
These are these arguments are only convincing if you haven't seen either of these movies. Oh, yeah
That's that's the other really big problem with this is
This is really great to appeal to people who've either not seen the movie or don't remember it very well because they'll be like
Yeah, I guess that is how it went ralph's right
This is just ralph is fucking what you mean like lying to your face
I would say like ralph, but he watched the movie in order to make this video
It's over that too. That's what he had to get the clips. He saw the films ralph is lying to you
Yeah, I'm gonna let him get away with it some poor man because he talked to my son through an iron gate
Talked to his son. That is so
Talked to his son. He's had a chat. He's like, hi little kid. What's up?
Let me put my fucking fingers in your mouth
It sounds like people trying to defend captain marvel and not to mention by the way
But uh all thomas would have been told was all from
Alfred and alfred is not gonna have a good position
Like you'll probably be like this guy was trying to tempt your son outside of the gate. He was touching him
He's putting his fingers in his mouth. Yeah, and this is the guy
This is the guy who is the son of the delusional lady who tried to you know, like this is
Just all bad
This is uh, this is really bad this guy bad news
You just cut that out of there alph
Wasn't a restraining order or something taken out on arthur flex mother
By thomas wayne or something possibly
I think took legal action in the do you mean in like the set of files or do you because I can't remember if anyone mentioned it
I forgot but I think there was something I can't remember correctly
Yeah, um, you know a lot of people like lie or incompetence
lie
What do you what's the vote of the of the of the table? What do you guys think it's a lie because you can't no
Fuck jay. God damn it. Listen
Jay, he had to go and get the scenes. He watched the film. He knew what happened in that scene
He knew this is jay. This is a scene where arthur
strangles a man
And ralph just said I talked to a scene. He talked to his son through a gate. No jay
No, you eventually
Yes, and jay. I'm gonna tell you about being a man, right?
You can't let people walk all over you like this
But even worse
Is that you can't let people walk all over you you can't let people make make you a victim
You've got to stand up for yourself. You gotta call this stuff out when it happens
Okay
Okay, jay. You gotta stand up and grow a spine bone. Don't let people do this to you. I'm gonna
I'm gonna take the
Strange middle road, uh, i'll be quick. I swear uh pack said deliberate mischaracterization for sure
I think that he felt that this was just a bending of the truth like there's some extra details that don't matter
I think that's what he would probably argue
He'd be like a lot of people have been echoing the whole he's clearly mentally ill
It doesn't matter if he did those things because you don't treat mentally ill people this way that sort of argument
It's like those details are irrelevant. He's clearly unhinged. You need to help him
You don't need to hurt him like that
Like I think that would be his rationalization
But then you could be like but you are leaving details out and he'd be like those details
Whatever
I think that's probably so it's like a mix of the two
no
This is look
That's it it's either parody or a lie it can't
There's no honesty here. Okay. I agree. I agree with satan
There's no honesty here
When satan says you're a liar
This man is a liar he's a
Terrible terrible liar
It could at least have been a good liar, but he's just a terrible obvious liar
Okay, be a better liar next time
Well, I mean that's the the four tier beef happens that we try and watch these things before watching the videos so that we can
Be like hey detail, but it looks like this. We didn't even need to see the movie for this like even chat like furious
Poor man because he talked to my son through an iron gate
joker's other supposed father figure which is
Robert De Niro and the only way this ending is able to happen is through this completely unrealistic
Can you please?
Which ones are unrealistic exactly satan what parts of this are unrealistic?
Can you point to the parts that are unrealistic?
It actually kind of seems like it all follows
I'm assuming you should do in the the because this is a common criticism the whole like there would be no candid camera
shit in this time
They'd never put someone's tape on a show
Which apparently is untrue?
Like I don't have the specifics on that but I don't even need them
Uh, because this is a fictional universe. All we need to know is that it's possible. It is possible
It is
It's logically possible and I think that they
Set it up. Well, it's all the scenes happen is through this completely unrealistic set of circumstances
So robert de Niro has a bit on his show where he's watching
the joker's stand-up
You can say that again pal, I don't know man if I saw this on tv, I probably laugh I'd be like damn that guy sucks
That's kind of his job
Because the arthur flex stand-up his stand-up routine is bizarre. It is out of this world bizarre
uh, if you if my job were to be a stand-up comedian talk show host kind of guy to show this sort of stuff to
Make you laugh a set up this bizarre and unusual would be on my top of my list
Yeah, like I don't know a lot of people like this is the thing the biggest arguments like it's unrealistic it's like hmm
I want you to to people who say that
Let's just transpose this to a more modern example
We got youtube we got the internet think of all the crazy people
Compilations and videos go viral. What's yeah, that's the future rags not the past
Remember hide your kids hide your wife all that stuff. Remember? Uh, I I ran for my life
All those oh, you mean on like news reports and stuff. Exactly. Yeah, these people just they go viral, right?
This is the this is the the quote unquote internet of that time is the tv
Tuned into it is a big deal
It's totally realistic that someone could get put up like that and then they could kind of become somewhat of a sensation, right?
Especially in a city like autumn, right?
It's kind of self-contained in a way
Feel free to elaborate on that if you wish gentlemen
No, I think you covered it perfectly ranks
I wasn't last night did a good job
right
you're fired
I talked to your manager
I don't have one of those. Oh, you're unaware of your own bad
I'm not gonna say who it is. I don't I don't want to dox them me in a wig
Stand up
You
Can say that again pal robert deniro starred in both tax driver and king of comedy
Oh my god, it's influences on its sleeve and then he gets probably why he's not he's probably why he's in this movie
I was gonna say like
I was I was saying this to rags. It's like isn't it cool?
The the person he looks up to is the same actor who played the character who looked up to a tv show host like
Anything has a cool connection. It's like no rip-off. You're like, oh
I think that's really cool
I
I kind of I like that
It's almost like you got I when we were watching that earlier
I almost called your ex when we were watching that earlier mauler
I was saying, you know, if you kind of change the timeline and the name
Just a little bit this could be in the same universe as king of or uh, yeah king of comedy
Maybe he just looks like an amazing 60 year old in king of comedy
And then he changed his name
That he like went on a drug bed dirt. It'll just well, it just came to murray murray's estate
So I want to clarify as well. I wasn't saying that ralph is saying it's a rip-off
I don't think he's used those words yet. It's just that that seems to be the general sentiment
It's like robert deniro's in it. It was pretty clear. He was ripping it off. It's like that's not
It's not a through line. That is not a through line
You can say that again pal robert deniro starred in both tax driver and king of comedy
The film wears its influences on its sleeve
And then he gets a phone call that tells him to come on robert deniro's show
Because he wants him to talk to him on the couch
And of course this same guy also happens to be famous for killing the three people on the subway. Hang on
Nobody knows that until he's on the couch
That's where he reveals that he was the one who killed him like ralph is gonna
This is just a coincidence that the murderer happened to be called up
Oh is he is he just saying like wow?
What are the odds of the guy who was doing all of this is also the guy who's getting called on to this show
Guy who has a really crazy bizarre setup. I think so
Logically possible and that's kind of the idea of the whole movie is that there could be a
Remember also knows this isn't called the joker. It's called joker, right? There could be more they're out there
All it takes is to have all these things people off the edge. The right amount of is like there's like hundreds of them
There's a lot right amount of stuff happening to the right person at the right time creates joker
Let's just let's just replay that to make sure that's what he says, which even though it's a rant. Sorry, let me play
He gets a phone call that tells him to come on robert deniro's show
Because he wants him to talk to him on the couch
And of course this same guy also happens to be famous for killing the three people on the subway
Which even though it's a random killing has become a beacon for this movement to take out the richer class
And of course this comes up on the show. Wow. I'm glad that all worked out
um
it's not like so so it's relevant because of
So this was set up like from rumor this the first scene
Of the film
We hear on the radio
Voice in the radio is saying trash stuff and how the heating bills are happening. It's affecting the rich. It's affecting the poor
It's affecting everybody
It instantly sets the tone of what's happening in gotham and throughout the whole movie
We see this stuff as well
We see its impacts on people and how they deal with it personally
We see the state of the streets and the cities like this is all set up really really well
I don't get why you don't see this. It's actually it's like it's set up in an obvious way
How does ralph miss it? I mean he's suggesting it's contrived for the person to have done those killings to have also been
The person who was seen in that stand-up shot to be brought on this show, but the problem is that both of those events
Draw back to uh specific character traits, right? So like
the
the the gun being
something that was on his person was something that lost him his job was something that uh
happened because of his insecurity slash paranoia slash being manipulated by
co-workers because of getting beaten and the um the intention to become a
comedian to to write jokes the aspiring career and his um
Appreciation of this talk show host like these are things that are this like there's like different
Plot lines that are all being developed from character traits going forward
Yes, they can they can coincide like there's there's no you have to highlight where it is that it it breaks
Uh some kind of ridiculous likelihood
um
But but I I don't think any of it does and the idea that it comes up in the conversation that he's killed these people
It's like he intends to kill himself on this show. He's not got anything. He says i've got nothing to lose
So why not admit to the world? I'm the guy who did it
Remember this he wants attention like that's one of the biggest things in this film is he wants admiration
He wants people to look to him
And at this point no matter what he does with his plan. This is like the point in no return, right?
He's not planning on going back to a normal life after this. This is where he
He soldiers forth with his plan, whatever it may be either. He's dead or he's killed somebody
Either way, he's basically
He's crossed over the point of no return. Why not admit it before all this even before even before he shot murray in the head
He had already murdered that guy who gave him the gun in the first place. He killed his own mother
He he made a big I don't know big
Like ruckus over there at the arkham asylum
He's already pretty much. He's pretty in deep already by the time he gets to the talk show
So he's already said on his course
Yeah, I don't I don't think it's contrived that he brings that up. I think that's a weird comment
I mean he gets chased by the police when he's going into the talk show, right? He had to escape the police
on this way to talk show
and to all
I'm gonna okay, so imagine being a police and then you see that
Like you're chasing a dude and you're like, oh fuck lost him. Well time to turn on a favorite show
Okay for all the people this is ralph saying this he said a few times
For all the people who say this is an incredible coincidence that all of this could actually happen, right?
Then again, it's all logically possible. But remember right when we talk about coincidences
Everything that is happening in your life you you is if you you watching this right now you
Everything that got you to where you are
Is the product of a million?
billion crazy coincidences
Which are only insanely unlikely in like hindsight, you know
Like when we look back we say that's an insane coincidence that could have never happened
But to us that's how things happen. That is the reality of what happened
So don't worry about it too much when people say like oh, that's an insane coincidence
Right, like you are where you are because of a gajillion coincidences lining up just right
So it's okay
What I would say is that we've got we you just have fundamental traits that uh
Then all lead to the events in this film
Like why does he shoot those guys like a combo of his character traits plus the world building?
Um, I guess to a degree plus the plot. Why does he end up on murray's show?
It's like it's almost entirely
His character plus plot as in he wanted his aspiration was to be a comedian. That was fundamental from the get-go
It's like
What would what would one do if one was trying to become a comedian?
It's like I don't know probably tried delivering their material in like a stand-up circuit and stuff and it's like uh-huh
Is it possible that could be recorded and seen by other people? It's like yeah, why not?
It's it's pretty much done at that point
This is joker. You could that's the thing that's what's so great about joker
Is that you look at the end of the film and you're like, okay
Let's say you're like a film detective, you know, like oh, I guess you happen in the cinema, right?
you could trace
everything back step
By step by step and there's never a step there where you go. That's not that doesn't make any sense
you never have to say that because there's always a logic logical like uh
Like a progression from one event to the next and you can trace it back and trace it back
To a bunch of little fucking punk kids taking a man's sign
Right, and he keep going and going and going look it all ends up lines up. It never breaks the rule of
The progression from one step to the next step
Is illogical and insane and it doesn't follow through and that's one of the reasons I really really
Like joker and I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of people are like, yeah
Like arthur fleck is kind of like me in a way. There's a little bit of arthur fleck in all of us
because
It's it's all logical progression. It could happen. It could be me and some crazy alternate
Right, you look at the uh, the pixar formula
The famous pixar formula where where they use the um, you know one day there was a man named martha fleck
He every day he was a clown and got beat up on the street and all that stuff one day
he got beat up and he got a sign a sign stolen and
He was blamed for it and then because of that this happened because of that this happened
And because of that he got a gun because of that, you know, it goes on and on and on to the very end
Until finally he shoots murray in the head. Uh, it's all step by step progress one one thing leads to the next
That's how you write a story. I mean, that's why that's how you write a cohesive plot
That's kind of what I meant about drawing it back to what the fundamental start of all of it is as you as you just said
He's like a he's a he's a guy with a clown job. It's like, okay, we take that we don't need an explanation for that
We just like that's it. Right? So what happens next?
It's like is there a possibility that someone could steal his sign to fuck with him in his day-to-day?
It's like absolutely then what happens then what happens then what happens and you just keep going and you have that one running at the same
Time as you have his interest in being a comedian running that's your base. Then you go then what happens then what happens
Everything runs nice and logically and those two things coincide with the show with murray
Yeah, he fucking shoots him
Class and of course this comes up on the show. Well, i'm glad that all worked out. You think that killing those guys is funny
I do
What a coincidence. I guess it's some of that dream like logic, right? They would just invite. No. No, I I gotta
Ralph I gotta like
everything like I said
Everything when you take what it is what happened and then you look back
You can say literally everything that happens is a series of insane
coincidences
Right
How is it that I met you
Uh well before I'd met basically any of the youtubers we managed to start up efap very soon after all the tlj stuff happened
What are the odds of me meeting you and wolf?
Well, you just so happened to have made just that one video that I just so happened to have watched because I just so happened
To have been recommended it you decided to send a message that I happened to catch because it was a youtube message
Which is unlikely to catch
Everything is the product of a
trillion
different incredible coincidences when you look back but
Something had to have happened, right? Yeah, and that's what that's what i'd be getting at
It's like well, there's logics like I did make that video
Is there a chance that rags would have seen it's like it makes sense that rags would have seen it
Does it make sense? The rags would have been so interested in it to send me a message to just hang out at some point
It's like why not? Why would that not happen? You know, it's like exactly
Gotta chill out with these
It's not the same as um
Fucking Han Solo turns up to the millennium falcon five minutes after it's moved away from jakku that happened to be the exact same place
As palpatine's fucking daughter in a junkyard like fuck off. It's way too contrived
But that's just the sequel trilogy as a whole it's uh
galactic coincidences
What the sequel trilogy is a whole
Yes, the whole the whole point is that is what happened is like from getting from step one to step two is that logical?
Step two to step three. Is that like a reasonable thing that would have actually happened. Yes. Okay, keep going keep going
That's the thing. That's the link between the steps
You need to keep so is that is molar extremely gay now what?
What?
Some of that dreamlike logic, right they would just invite this random guy on there to no, he's not a random guy
He's very specifically
The person from the video. Yeah, I don't know why you'd say random guy
They didn't just pick a random person to show up from the audience or something. No
Well, no, so what would have exactly what would have happened is that uh, that video was so bad
Murray would have been told about it, right
right
So
Have we got an example?
Anytime recently of a really bad video coming out and then a host being told about it by several people and then showing it
I don't know
I don't know. Yeah, that's uh, interesting. This real life is poorly written
Couch should not check him for weapons. Your son's been hit. So, uh
This is actually something that I find fascinating as a criticism. Why didn't they check him for weapons?
It's like why would this is what the 19? When was this based 1970s 80s?
78 I think so. This is this is before a lot of significant
Crackdowns on security happened. This is that's before 9-11
1981 is one joke and if kibble has taught me anything you can before 9-11
You could even take the katanas on the on the plane next to you
so
Yeah, like a lot changed after a certain events and um
You can see how how rather low security this whole thing is, of course, and he's got it in his ankle as well
It's um, not obvious or at least it's not obvious to someone who's uh, not familiar with guns
Um, no, they didn't they didn't fully pat him down. I don't think that that was standard back then at all
Um, yeah guy on there to talk on the couch and not check him for weapons
Your son's been hit by a drunk driver. He's dead
Yeah, they yeah, they didn't they didn't check anyone for bombs on airplanes either
Right. That was just that was a different time
All right, that was a different time
Oh, no, no, no, no, you cannot joke about that. Yeah, that's not funny
Oh ralph, you just don't get it. The whole ending was just a dream stop saying that
Bring the dream. No, I hate no, I think it was real
So
Well, for the sake of criticism, let's just treat it as real ralph
I don't need you to keep saying like it was a dream their full criticism invalid. No, no, no, we're not we're not gonna do that
That's fine. Yeah
Every character in the movie is just an asshole and a liar
And ignores joker deceives joker
So what about the ones who arm assholes and don't deceive him like I can say someone in this video is an asshole
Um
The dwarf and well, they're the ones that he mentioned earlier. So how is he saying this now?
Like you can't tell like this is the beam where you go all of them are mean except the ones who aren't it's like, okay
There are there are there's more than one mean character
There are at least three like it's a really boring criticism like come on man even you counted your own argument here
And a liar
And ignores joker deceives joker steers joker down the wrong path
Because it has to reinforce this message that society is bad. Society is bad. Yep. The movie I don't know the part
Yeah, I was gonna say I don't think the movie's trying to make it that clear cut though. It's just all of society sucks boo
it's more
If you are bad, then bad things will happen, but to those who are good and kind
Good things can happen. There are loads of flawed elements of society
No matter the political system I imagine and there's uh always going to be flawed people
He happened to be one of the people who experiences all of the worst parts in a row
And if anything the scene the scene is shown here like she
And her own way is also a victim, right?
You know, like we're in like listen, arthur you and me we're on this together, right?
I'm not a bad person. I'm a product of circumstances
right
There are there are villain there are
There are people who impact him who are not necessarily
Doing it for malicious reasons, right? Like this chick here
She's not like a bad person or anything one of the qualifiers he had was like ignores joker apparently
I guess she would come under that but not even necessarily that
Yeah
Because she does give him quite a what you would call a down-to-earth response to
What he's rambling about or well complaining about
Um
Like I wouldn't agree that she's ignoring him is what kind of what i'm getting at
But even still like it's just uh, I don't know
I just think that it's a very poor read on the film to just be like society bad moving on it's like whoa
hang on
He's a little bit more complicated than that
We had a huge budget you can tell because any artistic integrity or originality is completely removed from this film
Taxi driver and king of comedy are so tight. They aren't bogged down in scenes that need to extend. No
No, do not tell me
Do not tell me that taxi driver is not bogged down in scenes that we don't need
All right. I get it. He's fucking around with his guns in his apartment. I got it the third fucking time
I get it. I promise you. I understand. Okay, don't tell me that about taxi driver
The scene when we mauler and I watch this again
Every scene has got a little something everything tells us about him in some way it
Illustrates how he thinks about things how he acts his thought process and how it changes over time
From one thing to the next it all shows us how this one guy becomes
Joker, right?
Yeah, um, i'd like to highlight how incoherent that series of statements were that was he he like says
Uh low it's really high budget. He moves into creativity has been sapped out
He moves into there's no redundant scenes in taxi driver. Unlike this movie
You know, I mean like those three things. It's just like, huh?
I feel like a few sentences are missed between those that connect them together a bit stronger because this feels weird
He's bad, yep, the movie had a huge budget you can tell because any artistic integrity or originality is completely removed from this film
Yeah, because big budgets can't have that. Yeah, I was gonna say it's like do you really want to make that statement?
Artistic integrity is not a thing for big budget films
Yeah, that's a it's wrong
But be like
So like tell me ralph. What are the scenes and joker?
That are redundant that we don't need that don't tell us something
That don't make a statement or tell us or inform us
There's 10 seconds of flashbacks. Don't need to oh my god
I want to highlight as well. Uh, some of the people have been discussing this in chat and
The common criticism applied to jokers is about nothing but simultaneously it's too on the nose about what it's about
What
Sometimes life be like that. Yeah, bob says doesn't care
No, i'm not saying i'm saying this is the general view though. A lot of people parrot. It's interesting
I'm not saying I haven't heard any one person provide both of those statements. I'm just saying it's an interesting thought
I'm not hearing any disagreements. I must be jesus jay bev. Well, let's ask satan
Hmm
Ity's bad
Yep
The movie had a huge budget you can tell because any artistic integrity or originality is completely removed from this film
Taxi driver and king of comedy are so tight. They aren't bogged down in scenes that need to extend the universe of the film
Travis and oh
I can't even tell you
Let's let's check that that criticism out specifically for seconds film taxi driver and king of comedy are so tight
They aren't bogged down in scenes that need to extend the universe of the film extend the universe of the film
Wait, what is he trying to say?
Is that his way of saying world building so this is my no
So he's saying that like uh, it's like a dceu film bullshit where it's so the joke is walking down the street
And uh, he he sees a guy he bumps into a guy and a guy goes hey out of my way
And then he's like who are you man? He goes i'm aquaman out of my way
And then and then you're like, oh my god aquaman film
So, you know like oh so clunky when they just do that universal stuff
So my mother who knows nothing about comic books or batman or anything else saw joker loved it
And I asked her about
This the wayne family and stuff and she was like, what about it?
I was just like, what do you think about like the storyline the plot line?
Did you understand it all and she was she even went on to talk about how interesting it was that the um
the child was left alone as a result of
All of this which is a a reflection of joker i'm not gonna get into that right now because I really like thinking about it
But we'll do it if it comes if it comes relevant, but it becomes relevant
But a lot of people who know about batman see this as some kind of universe baiting. Uh shoehorn thing
When it actually you can swap all of their names to instead of bruce wayne
It's just bob wagner and his butler and it all works bill
You don't need it to be bruce wayne and this is proof
That they function in the story without having to rely on the extended universe quote unquote. This film was stand alone
They did not intend to make a sequel
Yeah, arthur fleck's journey in this in this movie is
is uh intimately tied in to the wayne family because
They he thinks at one point he is the son the abandoned son of thomas wayne
Which actually plays into what arthur fleck is looking for some sort of identity some sort of uh, something to call
Himself like like I said in that one line
He didn't know he really existed until you know that the whole event in the subway happened
So arthur fleck is really focused on getting something that makes him feel alive something that makes him feel like he exists
and this revelation
That he might be thomas wayne's son
Is something he can really grasp on to and the fact that it might not be true
And the fact that he was rejected wholeheartedly by the man who might be his father
It really crushes him and that's important to how to where he goes was at the end of the movie and why he goes there
satan's
I don't like yeah this criticism yms has this criticism as well. He's like, oh the waynes shoehorn did
I'm just like present your argument because it's weak
Because you have this film you could rename
It could be anybody which means if you want in it's like no
no
If you told me that this movie wasn't even intended to be a dc movie about joker
It was just some guy and then they were like, oh wait, this could be like a batman movie
Then they reworked some details. I don't believe you
I'll believe you because it works and this is the thing that's why I use the example
What would be forced is if there's lots of I don't know
posters of some kind of other superhero that's around and everyone's like
Like the superman's already around and he and then like at one point joker looks up and he flies over
And then he's like, I wonder what his life is like and then it just says it's super bad coming soon
This is always really you know and talk about shoehorned references people always bring up the rogue one one where um
The the characters are walking through like that area and they bump into the two people from the bar in a new hope
Like how you why is that shoehorned? Well because the likelihood of that is staggeringly low. That is insane
like well
Nothing for the story either. Yeah, there's no reason they're there they just bump into them
You're just in there
It'd be one thing if thomas wayne and
Ralphred and ruse wayne were just in the movie just to be in the movie. Did you say ralphred?
Ralphred
He puts the button butler
But they're in the movie for a reason
Okay, they're central to arthur flex journey. Okay, they're not just in there to say oh, look it's a batman movie
And then they're never seen again
And it was pretty cool to have uh thomas wayne talk about how people wear masks because they're cowards when his son is going to grow
up to be batman
Oh my god, exactly and also on an off note, this does nothing really do with with this criticism
but I really like the fact that um
Thomas wayne is kind of portrayed as you know
He says that you know, he looks down on poor people. At least that's what he looks like on tv
and so he's not but uh
The metanarrative is you know outside this movie
We know that his son bruce wayne grows up to be batman
And he idolizes his father as this patron saint of what it is to be good and right and truthful
And I really like this idea because it really builds and feeds into heroism the idea of heroism and romanticism
And how much bruce wayne did I idealize his father?
But you see the real thomas wayne here in arthur flex journey was he's just human. He's kind of a jerk
And yeah, not exactly perfect like calling everyone clowns
Uh, yeah calling everyone an asshole move
Yeah, that was that's pretty does a jerk move. I really I kind of like that personally and there's nothing to do with the actual criticism of that
Yeah, no, I know you mean like um
the pov, uh
Because I can totally believe that a growing up bruce wayne would have thought his father was a hero
I love that part
It's all functional and it doesn't have to have a sequel to be functional like it's not like we're like
Well, why did you why did you bump into aquaman? Why did you see bruce wayne?
Like you need to know I need these other movies
And they do that by the way, and you know, they do that in the movie
Well, I I think they've announced it. Um
I think they will rags and I were talking about that and we're very it's just concerning the
I will watch it the likelihood of a joker sequel being as good as this film is
Very very low. Yeah, it's very low. Is it the same team behind it?
Apparently well, we got the director and writer which is very important, but we don't uh, Joaquin Phoenix isn't confirmed yet. I'm not sure
What the plan would be without him
I love it. There are things you can do but I don't think I would do it. This is the history of it. I guess
listen, I
specifically said to mauler earlier
That it might be better
If they don't have joker and they instead
Tell the tale of like a different character or something or exactly
They perceive the events of the joker and how it maybe influences them
That's actually a a theory that I really I really enjoyed this
Joaquin Phoenix's joker is not the joker that batman would face
But he's like the inspiration for the joker that batman would eventually face. Well, yeah
Remember and I happen to know that in the comics there are three jokers according to the supercomputer or whatever. Oh my god
Yes
Oh my god
Taxi driver and king of comedy are so tight
They aren't bogged down in scenes that need to extend the universe of the film
Travis and rupert comedy's type in the stories
It's rupert's and travis's character and actions that cause them to spiral joker
Um, so it's joker's choice to take the gun
Yeah
Yeah, I mean he definitely makes choices
I mean we could talk about how affirmatively each of them
Like push the other push the other plot. Yeah. Yeah, but but they're definitely
I mean, I think that's one of the weaknesses a taxi driver is showing us the progression of how he got to the point
where he's in
But with joker, it's so solidly explained along the way how he does
solidly solidly, yeah, yeah, I agree, uh
Is it was clearly joker's choice to kill robert denier? I don't think anyone's gonna be uh debating that
Yes, like like in real life it's a combination of choices he made and things that just happen to him
Anyway, I if ralph was citing like, you know, it wasn't entirely his choice to shoot the guys on the subway
Out of self-defense i'd be like I I can see a conversation there
But it was absolutely his choice to fucking execute the last guy, wasn't it?
Yeah
Like the idea that you you quick react. It's absolutely a choice. You can choose not to shoot. No, no, no
I'm saying there's a conversation to be had there because the idea that you like of reflexes or
Responding to the idea that you're about to be killed is is less of it's less of a choice to make it's still a choice
It's just but but I would say that it doesn't matter because he fucking hunts down and kills the last dude
So
Yeah, I don't know. Let's see. Let's see if he uh qualifies this
Travis's character and actions that cause them to spiral joker
Gets beat up a lot. It's not your fault. Your life sucks. It's the fault of society
everyone so
Um, there's loads of things to talk about as to exactly how joker became joker
And I just don't like I don't want to spend a million years talking about this film as if nobody here has seen it
Because the whole point of this review is that he did see it but to broadly say like because society
It's like
He gets beat up by poor people in the beginning and then he gets beat up again by rich people they're in the subway
Okay, it's it's it's society. It's it is ironically speaking. It is society. Okay, I know it's uh,
I really need to say by now. I know it's a meme
But yeah, it's society. It's not the poor people who are bad. It's not the rich people who are bad. It's
The general society of gotham city at that moment. That's full of toxicity
Yeah, all unrest and disappointment anger bitterness. It's all over the place. It's like some kind of breed. Oh my god
I returned
One around you is just a jerk and beats you up. So the solution is to shoot dinero in the head
What everyone come on man
This is weak toes
That's not true fucking taxi driver
I don't know what to do with my life. So i'm just gonna kill people. What is this all
Is this all he does like
Oh, we have text driver does this this this this a joke is like he just shoots people in the head. Okay, let's move on
It's only nine minutes like he just he just leaves out all of the movie
every happens joker just like this is the conclusion because he
Is signed or stolen? It's like oh, okay cool
reduced taxi driver and say
Oh
Travis bickel. He just thinks all the world's problems are going to shoot the politician in the head that one time
like
what
What indeed fair?
Society, sorry everyone around you is just a jerk and beats you up. So the solution is to shoot dinero in the head
Oh
Are you having some psychological issues your notebook looks like a crazy person's note
Yeah, that's it. He doesn't have good handwriting because of his upbringing not being focused on education. Obviously
It's actually part of graphology too. Crazy people tend to write
Read like crazy people their their lettering and their syntax is erratic
Are you saying that there's a difference between crazy people and normal people and honestly, I know a novel idea. I know
What is um, what is uh, his handwriting quality is not anywhere near as interesting as what he's writing down
Yeah
Come on ralph
But his uh, his disturbing jokes that those are those are really good insight into his kind of disturbed mentality
He wants to be a stand-up comedian
But his jokes are really disturbing and a really good look into what he's actually thinking you do well today
Also, okay
So, uh joker has many redeeming qualities walk in phoenix is a good actor and he saves this film
The cinematography is decent. Wow
Shame i'm a 14 year old for liking it. I hope this isn't the complete list of redeeming qualities
Oh gosh, well you got two i don't think he knows what the word many means
More than
Couple of good qualities the cinematography is decent
Many redeeming qualities here are all two of them. I very much like the cinematography and joker
I'm not gonna I'm gonna fucking say it's the masterpiece but decent is not the word I would use
I mean this and can we uh, this really highlights how well walking phoenix plays the joker part because even ralph ridd
Has to say it's a good his acting is a great quality
a lot of people uh
Don't deny that but they also want to like asterisk it
The one i've been seeing a lot lately is like he kind of just went crazy though
Like he's just an actor who did well, uh, there's there's tweets i've been telling you guys about where they're like
He broke his foot kicking the dumpster idiot. Do you know what acting is you're not supposed to actually break your foot?
I'm saying the same thing about jango when uh, yeah, and uh,
It hits its hand on the actual glass
Yeah, well, um, I was gonna say the more apt example I imagine is the one-to-one with vigor mortinson in lord the rings
He kicked the helmet. He broke his toe or his foot whatever. Um, I guess he's a bad actor now
And this by the way, this has nothing to do with ralph. This is a tweet from somebody that said that and it was really annoying
Yeah, that's why he shouted in that one instance. Isn't it a tweet from ralph? No the uh,
Wigo mortinson. Yeah, he yells he kicks the helmet and he yells in frustration. That's actually because he broke his foot
Yeah
Its influence is on its sleeve. It's not really subtle at all
That doesn't mean it doesn't have good elements because it certainly does
Phoenix's performance is terrific. It was a nice change of pace to see a superhero film that looked like
Why is he a superhero? Why is this a superhero film? Why are you saying those words in your mouth?
He thinks he means comic book film. He must mean comic book film
No, I think that he is calling a superhero because
I guess in his mind, they're just like one in the same. Yeah, it's like the genre. It's like
So it's a superhero movie called batman is a superhero therefore
Portman this film is about this is a superhero film, you know all the superpowers and super
Stuff that happens in this film because he's established. It's definitely not realistic
My favorite part of this film is when joker flies up to the sun
Punches parallax with the giant green fist and deep balls in the sun. That was awesome. That was pretty awesome
Yeah, I just I just be like ralph took on a superhero movie. Come on
Have good elements because it certainly does
Phoenix's performance is terrific. It was a nice change of the audio
Wasn't infested with cgi the lighting wasn't all flat and boring. I just overall think it's pretty mediocre
And I really wanted to delve into like the themes and explore this film a bit because maybe there's something a bit more to it
But I honestly am just not even interested
Because I don't like the movie that much
You don't say yeah. I I mean I I gleaned that from the video
He's been very subtle about it. I think it was very
I could barely tell you don't like the movie. Thanks
And it comes from a place that I think is a bit artistically bankrupt, it's not a jonathan glazer film it's not stop
Everyone else you handle this because i'm like i'm just going to go off on this guy if I have to explain how it's
Not artistically bankrupt. It's well, that's that's the problem, right?
So people are always like i'm freaking efab takes like a million years to respond to any point
Do you see what he just did in like two seconds?
He said the film is artistically bankrupt. You know how long we can take to respond to that
That was a terrible point to make awful
Absolutely
I'm picturing like a guy with a bowl of poop and he just throws it into the center room
Smashes poop everywhere and then we have a mop and it's like well
This will take just as long as it took for him to throw it, right?
I want to respond to it too. I want to respond to it too. Do it. No, it's not
No, it's not nailed it
Good job. Oh man
Something I actually want to explore. It's a by the numbers
Copycat studio movie. There we go. Copycat. He said it now
How was the joker in any way by the numbers I was at a copycat
What is it copycatting and don't say taxi driver without fucking qualifying it explain it explain it to someone
As if they haven't seen taxi driver because I had to watch taxi driver for the first time
Because people kept saying jokers like taxi driver jokers like taxi driver. Now watch taxi driver. It's not fucking anything like taxi driver
Like that's insane that people say that I think a lot of people they hear that and they're like, oh, yeah
Because at its most its most flat its most basic
Most like absurdly simplistic level it shares a similarity in a very very broad way
But like it's nothing
Like we said at the beginning it's like which of the the four movies that we mentioned is it most like it's like
Well, you know what there's parts to all of them that you can connect to joker
But I think you can say that about literally everything like you can connect parts of movies to other movies to other movies to other movies
Trying to defeat an evil force or a protagonist who has to overcome adversity to do a thing that he wants
Oh, what's that the matrix? Well, that's just fucking the chronicles of riddick, isn't it?
No artistic integrity no artistic value to this movie apparently I guess the joker didn't take enough bananas to walls
What what is he was?
Good reference talk about
About the bananas
Jay, you don't know about the banana. No, I don't know that oh my god. I'm about to be
And like you got points today wasn't it?
1917 and no just lost them all again. Wasn't uh, wasn't it sold for three hundred thousand dollars?
Yeah, it's a banana. So someone I guess an actual artist
I don't know how else to describe them. They taped
They taped a banana to a wall and it was like a set piece in a gallery and someone paid 300 000 for it
And then some guy tore it off the wall and ate it some laundering
Yeah, that sounds like money laundering to me and then didn't someone write in like blood on the wall Epstein didn't kill himself
Now that is art, okay
Some good some some good red. Wow, you said the same thing I did you copy cat film. Wow
Yeah, one of the brothers in the past has just been trying to copy marvel. Okay, let's copy scorsese character studies from the 1970s and 80s
How can you say okay, this is definitely a parody how do you say this with a straight face and does not be a parody
Who is this?
It's made to panda to teen and fuck off
What does a gay face look like?
You know, he probably should explain to people who haven't seen these movies because this video is made seemingly specifically for people who have never ever
Hardly even heard of these movies, let alone seen them
Um, can we read what else what's on the we we can I was just gonna say the structure of this video is a nightmare
like
all over the fucking place
studios
Well only green light comic book movies now
Joker is an attempt to make an adult superhero drama
Does not stand on its own you don't fucking put an apostrophe when you make the possessive form of it
That's a double
You can't just add fucking apostrophes something else. It's not how this language works you make films
Even okay
It's exactly even joe knows that
Yeah, it does not even join those
But it does not stand on its own as a drama if the what the fuck is that?
If the batman joker brand was not attached
attached attached attached
attached to ched
Wait, did they actually spell that wrong? Yes
Yes, we're at two fuckups now. That's about one every two lines. Don't understand. It's a tad of chad
That's how you're supposed to pronounce that
If joker brand was not attached to the film it wouldn't have
That's right, isn't it? It would not have been yeah, that's right
I know i'm just
It wouldn't have have it would not have been successful
And most likely would not have even been made
It's made to pander to teenagers
Well, he's consistent. He's at least he's consistent in his message. He's continuously consistently lying
He said 14 year olds earlier and 14 is in fact a teenage year. So
Nice is still the overall also a big gigantic lie. This is dishonest and
Misleading well, we could take one line at a time. Oh, no studios every line only greenlight comic book movies now
1970
That's just a stupid thing to say
That out ralph were you not like, oh, yeah, that's right. If he was here, I guarantee you'd say like no, not all films
i'm saying like mostly
Oh, but that's so wrong. That's an irrelevant point. Yeah. Well my response to be
To him would be like oh, well, that's not the point i'm responding to responding to the point you made in your video
Well, no, he doesn't even matter most or most films of comic book movies now, you know
Like a lot of movies get made therefore another one existing
Joker is an attempt to make an adult superhero drama not a superhero movie
I agree that it's adults. Uh, what is what are you highlighting as the problem? Show me the superhero that's in this movie
Yeah, clearly batman. He's just young
Young bortman
It doesn't stand on its own as a drama
so
Tell me ralph
What does it need?
To really be a drama. What does this movie lack?
That if otherwise it possessed would make it a drama. It lacks the supreme subtlety of the king of comedy
Oh my god
Do you mean the one where the protagonist says the title of the film?
Yeah, that one
That's the that's the on-point subtlety you need in the joker so that it can be an actual drama
The attachett attached all right
It doesn't stand as a drama if the batman joker brand was not attached to the film
it wouldn't
have been successful and most likely
Wouldn't have even been made probably wouldn't have been as successful now and it probably wouldn't have been made as it stands because it's
But it's joker. So if joker didn't exist, it would have to be called something else. I mean you would have to exist differently
Laughter, um, maybe he wouldn't have gotten the funding if he couldn't attach it
like I just
Like I think with some of these points
I'll just be like meaning what and i'm waiting for him to conclude that's a bad where i'd be like how is that a bad?
the man in the portals definitively, um
And it's made a panda to teenagers. I would say
It's red dollar
That comment is frustrated. What does the r stand for?
Restricted rape restricted rape. What is that?
That's not what I was expecting
Rhino rhino restricted rated rhino rated r for rhino
All right, let's enjoy this section then full frontal milking
Joker isn't the first r rated superhero film recently
It's different in a way because it is I guess more mature
I hesitate to use that word mature, but I guess it is
Because we'll think back to dead pole, right which is clearly a comedy
It is an adult r rated film with a juvenile comedy
and the maturity
not dichotomous
Do not say that they are as incredible. I don't think he said they were did he? He said it was juvenile
He's trying yeah, but I think rags got that from him saying like it's
Joker's more mature because and then dead pool is and then declared a couple things then said comedy and it's like
Um
But oh no, I fucked up i'm so sorry. I was not where my mouse click was
Why did it cut all the way back to a fucking clip of jared lee does joker like really
I fucked up. I fucked up. Well looks like you could have showed us. I want some you want some beef
Honey, it's over again. It accidentally was a little bit high, but my pointer was on the thing. I saw it was on the thing
I believe we were like was it nine minutes ish. Yeah, this is where we copy scorsese character studies from the 1970s and 80s
A corporate product joker isn't the first r rated superhero film recently
It's different in a way because it is I guess more mature is different
In a way in a way
I didn't realize that
As in a way it's different the dead pool if you want comedy
Stay but they have the other places
Pupkins meeting with jerry was different than
Arthur flex meeting with thomas wayne same sort of difference there. Well, I mean you have both male protagonists. So just saying
Remember when all the grasshoppers at a bug's life were talking underneath the sombrero hat in the desert
I remember that yeah
It's similar to like it's it's different in a way from the d-day scene in saving private ryan
Just it just the details though
Oh
Right kind of the details ralph ralph gave 1917 three and a half stars
What are you?
Out of what out of what well the the I guess the way to install
It was six out of ten is what no seven out of ten is when he gave it. I guess
3.3 point five out of five. Yeah. Yeah
Bullshit
Don't you imagine he gave it 3.5 out of 10 that would be fucking insane
What surprised me though with this garbage we're watching now
Apparently he makes good stuff
It's just I haven't seen enough of him. I think i've seen people think cosmonaut variety now makes good stuff. Yeah
Yeah
Well, yeah
It's not like everybody is cosmonaut variety. All right, like fuck. Oh my god, that would be a world to live
Not everyone's that retarded
So and so, uh, I remember watching his game of thrones one outside of a few points
I thought it was pretty good. Like he said that stannis was well handled in game of thrones and it hit my soul
um
Need to use that word mature, but I guess it is
Because we'll think back to Deadpool, right? Which is clearly a comedy
It is an adult r-rated film with a juvenile sense of humor. It's violence is cartoonish and funny
Logan is a film that tried to push boundaries more in this respect and joker is do you see that in the bottom left?
Uh, no, I did not find joker. Logan is a film that you think joker wanted to be like this film much
Fucking don't that's an odd sentence. That is that is an odd sentence
Do you you think joker wanted to be like this film much?
Uh, no
How do you okay
We've been dealing with the taxi driver and the king of comedy and like logan
We're what's give me the connections because I have a face like male protagonist
All right
I personally like logan, but it's nothing like the joker at all. It's two totally different journeys. Oh, he means because it's good
No, I think so. That might be it. That's the only way it's like logan both good films joker and logan are both excellent
That's how it ripped it off
trying to be
Joking the idea of being good from logan that logan film was good. Let's rip that off
Which which part you want to rip off like it'd be good. Why would you put that there?
You just try to piss people off like why would you do this?
Why are you the way that you are?
And he just seems really angry about this like the fact that people like this film. He seems like
Like I understand it's like when something is really bad and loads of people like it and you're like fucking really though
No, it's like stop
Like like when everyone's telling to him how brilliant something is and it's terrible. It really does wear you down
So I understand why he feels his way, but he's wrong
He like throws the gun down instead of shooting murray opens up his wolverine claws and just stab, stab, stab, stab, stab
and we're like, whoa
That would support my expectations more in this respect and joker is the final form of that
The final form of like adult or mature quote unquote comic book movies
Good film. What is him happening in his video right now?
I guess he's just saying the joker makes sense that it happened because
The the way was paved by logan and that was paved by deadpool, which I don't even necessarily disagree with that
Is it just a good one? Yeah
I'm more like asking why why does he have this on screen right now? Like is joker a good film?
Like oh god, we're only half. We're less than halfway through. Yes
It is a good film. Well, let's let's all five of us answer that question before he does i'm gonna go with yes
Yes, yes, absolutely. All right
Nailed it. So what are the five of us 14 year olds?
And everyone knows how democracy works if he says no we still win because there's more of us
Yeah, three of us one of him get fucked. So I want a podcast on that on that podcast
I said joker was a good movie. I think I said joker is a good movie before. Yeah, so i'm gonna explain why
Why i'm an idiot. Oh, it's okay. We already know
But you were right before you were right before
We discovered it organically
I see now now he said that. Oh, no, he was an idiot before
Okay, so you think that have someone having a would he would you think that would you say that you had a bad take before?
Ralph? Oh, no
No, he just changed his opinion. What's wrong with that? That's not how fucking dare you jay?
Gay you've been ruined since you hung out with that efap guy. You think he changed his opinion, but he was right both times
It's pronounced electronic fat
Well, I did pronounce it that way just anagramically
I read them. That's a lie anatomically
That's an a
I'm gonna go i'm gonna go p. Ew
Normally it's fap then p god. Yeah p fap sounds like it means something else
I wonder i've never actually like masturbated while I was peeing
Is it is is that sounds like it's functionally possible. I don't know how it works mechanically
Science teach you when I was 14 told me that you couldn't do that
What are they what do they know
I mean, I guess you can't simultaneously ejaculate while you're peeing
He told the whole class that it's impossible to pee while you're having sex
Boy boy, did I prove him wrong? Oh no, so pissed right on his face
Yeah
You give him a piss direct to me. Oh my goodness
Oh
Oh, that's the old mexican halloween
God damn it Martha. Piss direct on me. Haha you
Please okay
Love movies. I love going to the movies. So i'm sitting down in theater
I'm watching a joker movie and I enjoyed it
You know, I was enjoying it because it i'm sitting down in a movie theater watching a movie
But there's a more to a film than your initial. There's a motor film. What there's a more
That's a more
But there's a more to a film than your
Impression of a film than when you see it agreed. There is more to a film than your initial impression
I agree. That's why I fucking despise the last jedi now and when I walked out of the theater. I was just confused
There is so much more going on in a film like when you watch
Citizen kane for the first time I gotta admit like i'm sure his point is valid
but whatever citizen kane gets brought up in a video essay, it's just like
I'm gonna get to watch that movie these days because well in case you don't like it
Are you worried?
I've never seen it. I don't know if I even care about it
Like it's so old. It's the movie if you haven't seen it. You're not a film critic. So
Like imagine how jay feels he's not a film critic to like the nth degree
But he didn't he didn't see anything. No, he's still prestige. That's good enough. Okay
If you're a moron you go that's boring that's a boring movie. Whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is getting confusing now
You know what? I want you to watch film that's just paint dry literally paint drying
This is my film about paint. Well, no, see we've applied the coat of paint and now it's drying
You're an idiot if you think that's boring. He would say that's fair. Probably he's saying you're not allowed to find citizen kane boring specifically
What? Oh, no, it's not
Why is he
Twine mauler, why is he trying?
Sorry
tying
Why is he tying boring finding things boring to intelligence? I don't I don't know like
It does it that's not a strict through line because this is the thing like my if someone watched prestige and told me they found it
Boring i'd be like, yeah, I mean I could I could see how it's possible. Uh, what did you find boring?
Like and then you can explore their reasoning. You can't just say if you find it boring you're a moron
It's like yeah, some people watching football and
Television is boring. Some people think that my favorite book, right? My favorite book is account of Monte Cristo, right? Love it
Alexandre Dumas, he's a black man and he wrote this book. It's amazing. It's fucking stellar. It's my favorite book ever
Guess what if someone said you know what this film's sorry
It's fucked this book's really boring then i'd be like, yeah, I can actually I could see why you think it's boring
It's it's yeah, absolutely
That doesn't mean they're stupid. This means that they found it boring. This means that the one's exciting to them
It's the peak of subjective. There's a reason so like it's kind of our job
well, some of us who have it as like their main sort of income right now, like I guess it would apply to uh
A lot of people in general who don't even have it as a main income actually, but it's kind of the job to
Go further than boring or fun the idea being I like this film. It was fun. I don't like this film
It was boring. It's like it's our job to go further. It's like we can't just say that
We're supposed to explain why and why things do stuff to our feeling tisms
so
What i'm getting at is the like I think we did this on an efap before or stream but boring
Is irrefutable because it's describing how you felt but then if they say it's boring
Because and then for example joker wasn't in joker enough. He's in it for like five minutes
You'd be like, okay, that's stupid
Apparently you would even watching
Jay listen to this. Okay, you ready?
Like when you watch citizen kane for the first time if you're a moron you go that's boring that's a boring no
wow
Find it boring like you could you could recognize
All of the things and the themes and the scenes and the subtleties and all that you could recognize all that
But also be like, you know what?
I was bored
Guess what movie I was when I watched taxi driver
I was bored for a lot of it, but I get it. I understand all this stuff
I paid attention still kind of bored. All right, doesn't mean you're stupid because you find something boring
I just I just think that's really unfair. No one of people
Pissed this video. It's like what the hell man
because for reference, um
I've heard quotes about this but this is well past what me and rags had seen at this point
So with a lot of these movies, uh, if they're good people tend to have you know
They might like it they might dislike it and then but if they're good movies and they're well structured
You can see the value in it even after me months after you watch the initial viewing
You can think about what you saw you can watch it again
Maybe you can find more points more points of value now with bad movies
You can't really you don't really have that it's just it's just bad. Okay, maybe I liked it before before
Maybe you find it
All right when I watched the first time then on our second viewing or we could think back on it like wow
That was awful. I really want to see it again. I don't even think about it
I'd like to highlight that like ralph. Can I just say this about?
Everything like if anyone ever says boring about anything's book and then he's like no citizen Kane's difference is deep and intellectual
I'd be like, yeah, so is telly-tubby's. Fuck you
Ralph is literally being the straw man version of objectivity that people like to turn to this
Yeah
We have to be the subjective people here. We have to be like, hey guys, he's wrong because this is entirely up to you
It's not something that can be definitive about boring is super subjective
And you can find things boring but still appreciate them
And like, you know what? Like how many times are you bored? Like let's take school. Let's say you're at school
And you're in a classroom and you're learning about stuff
It's like and you're soaking up all the information and you're learning stuff
But you're bored that doesn't mean you're stupid because you find it boring because you don't understand that it's exciting that
The fucking mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell
And that's why they look to find as many different ways as they can to teach people stuff because boredom is like the biggest killer of
Being able to absorb information. They're like we've got to find more interesting ways of delivering it
Yeah
I hate being bored boring boring sucks
Been boring watch
Citizen cane for the first time if you're a moron you go that's boring. That's a boring movie without actually reading about citizen cane
And yeah, you have to read about it. You can't just watch it. You got to read the books about citizen cane
I was gonna say
Let's choose classes and you have to watch all my videos. You have to donate to my patreon. Oh no, hang on
You know pallets of cash directly to my house. I know that reference
Well, it's because we watch it at the same time
good
interference
Breaking film and its impact on cinema and the same thing with you can have a film that was impactful on cinema and it still be boring
Yeah 2001 if someone said 2001 is boring. I'd be like, I mean i've heard a lot of people describe 2001 is boring
Boring me for example. I watched it. Yeah pretty recently. I was like, what the fuck let's let's let's do a test in chat one
One for 2001 being boring two for it being exciting. I'm making a false dichotomy deal with it
Vote
Exciting even if you didn't think it's boring. It's not exciting read the book. Wait, you're saying it's definitively not exciting
no
Okay, well i'm curious how chat will react let's see if we get some more ones or we get some more twos
Yeah, 1.5. Damn you ruined my false dichotomy
Yeah, let's just say press two if you're a fucking idiot. Yeah, if you're a moron press
the wrong one
If you're smart what if you're smart
I'm seeing a lot of ones
Guys do you know how moronic you are, you know, I see a 69 I see a 1.2
I see trees of green red roses, too. Oh, that's that's nice
That's a reference to that uh that film madagasca
That's a reference to good morning vietnam
So, yeah, uh, it's a common relatively common for people to say
Uh, I just i've heard from a lot of people that 2001 is boring i'm, sorry
Yeah, I read a little bit about it after I watched it and apparently
Even back in the day people were like invited about this like some people were like this is amazing and uh, we were like, yeah
very reasonable because
2001 has a lot of uh atmospheric shots
It still holds up very well. Yeah, it still holds it very well. Very impressed with the visuals. I was like wow
That's it still looks pretty fucking amazing
The ending is stupid. That's your opinion and you're you're a moron
Okay, I have it on good authority that you're a moron
Because you don't like space, baby
Ralph would explain it very clearly that you are a moron
2001 the same thing with any other film that you can listen that's people say are boring
Meanwhile you think jokers are great. Did you just say any film you can list the people say are boring what?
That's that's that's like all
So if you say any films
Okay, so the straw man rags came up with slightly. There was any of the sort of one has now been sorry
I was wrong. He has said it
God damn it
Is this a parody?
Come on, ralph read the description. I'm gonna read the description of his
View it and he's like haha. I totally fooled you guys with my stupid dumb shit
This is definitely oh my god
He's just said category film and animation
If you took the link from here, that's a it's a re-upload it so we can finish it. No, no, it's uh, it's the original
I'm looking at oh my god. He is stupid
Oh, no. Well, yeah, you know what? I found his description boring circus. I'm a dummy
This video, you know what? No, i'm not gonna say this video is boring i'm not gonna go that far
Video it's entertaining in the same way suicide squad is entertaining
There's definitely one of them. I was
Breaking film and its impact on cinema and the same thing with
Guys boring thing with any other film that you can list
Haven't seen any of them. They all look boring
Well, they think joker's a great movie because they sit down in the theater and they watch it once and they go wow
That was a good movie. What the fuck are you saying?
What is this?
It's just like him lashing out against the normal the girls cinema. They watch the movie and they say it's good
This is some elitist bullshit
Yeah, definitely get it better than you because I don't think citizen kane's boring and I don't think 2001 space odyssey's boring
And but I joker's dumb and if you like it you're dumb because I didn't think it's boring people walking out of movies
Instead of watching this can we watch jay longburn reacting to this?
He is gatekeeping like i'm just picturing this big old gate and he is he is moving it
He's making it very thick and he's preventing any of us from moving past it. He's like nope
Not allowed just because we're too stupid to understand good cinema
Well according to ralph if the 100 of people like 100 of movies when they first see it
That's why people like the joker
Is this this statement here is so
Because it's people joker's presented in a way that normal people can understand it and it's really
It's not like simple, but it is simple, but it's not like simple like a fucking episode of jay day the jet plane
Yeah sharing's caring but with the joker it's just it's easily digestible
Anyone could watch the joker and be like oh, okay. I get it. I understand it. Let me be pretentious for a second
It's it's impacted cinema to a degree. It's isn't it the most successful. I rated film in history now. Yes
And it's shown that uh comic book movies quote unquote can absolutely be profitable when not marketed to a wide audience
That's going to change things. I don't know. You could be like deadpool and logan proved that and it's like
Well, three's a pattern, right? So we got a definitive now and this is the biggest success they've had out of the three
um
So the idea like if we're going from you said it was boring, but it changed syllabus like all right
Well, you know is there can I argue with this change cinema and you found it boring?
Well, I did he say I found it boring. I can't remember
I was just I was just laughing because when you when you uh, search on youtube bad take joker review
The two that come up with this one and jenny nickels one
They both go really bad takes on this movie, okay
It's a good job that ralph isn't a wahman. So we don't be oh god, we'd be dead
though there may be some backlash for this because
Well, I was actually going to go with like this is the first time we've covered ralph and ralph is definitely
Ralph is in this this tier list. I would put of youtubers where it's like, hey
They're good and it's like yeah, no i'm sure like they they're great and everything
It's just that this is not a good take and and the this isn't us saying you should never watch this person. Okay
like you just
I don't know
Some some people have blind spots is all I can say about this like we all we all fuck up
Look at look at mel. I'm crying right now. I've literally never made a bad video
Crying in
All right guys
People say are boring
Meanwhile, they think joker is a great movie because they sit down in the theater and they watch it once and they go wow
That was a good movie and they don't think about it at all
When you actually take a second to think about the film you just watched it's a completely unoriginal bland superhero movie
That takes from tax driver and when you actually think about the joker, but it's okay. You realize it's a
movie
I don't need to do is to cut a little bit here cut a little bit there
And it's fucking terrible name the superhero then
Who's the superhero in joker ralph? Tell me point out clearly. It's moray
Murray super charismatic
He's super a program show clearly no one here who likes the joker has ever
Reflected on the movie or watched it again or I thought about it a second time
I'll just watch the theater. That was good. And then we own here just defending the joker. Is that what does that what happened?
This video is hoes mad
Like ralph is just like outright say we're halfway through he hasn't he hasn't actually told us white shit yet
He's just oh, I think no he did. He did. He said that thomas wayne punched him for no reason
Oh, he said the movie's bad because the movie's bad
Yeah, idiots morons like he's just outright being like he's upset he's angry people like this
This is like people like video
He's upset people like this film. Do you think he has like personal beef with someone who worked on it?
Because that's my explanation right now
Walking phoenix fucking garrick a movie with shit. No one likes you
Like the cabaret guy like beat him when he was younger
One time ralph the movie maker
He was at a comedy club and he gave stand-up and it was like this video. It wasn't funny at all
So people laughed at him like we're doing
And then they played it on television and this reminds him of that so he hates it. It makes sense rex
Can you say thought thought?
No
Say it how you normally say it thought
Yeah, thought thought hey rags. No, what say sentence?
sentence
No, no say it like you normally say it
sentence no
Sentence you say sentence
sentence
Yeah, because you have you have an n you have an n and then there's a t after it. I got shit to do
Fucking shit too
I'm not gonna say sentence. I'm gonna say sentence. It's a subtle t rags. Say horror horror. No, not whole here. Say horror
horror
Horror
Anyway
Act to lee
Akachoo. I will pronounce every
syllable sentence
Aluminum why would I say it like that? Wow, that's that was way off man. Aluminum
Doesn't even start with a y aluminum
Aluminum
Al you human them think about the aluminum, you know, why you know why people in america say aluminum
Um, i've heard this I have no idea what the source is so it could be
Not true
That it was originally a typo that was mass printed on something and then it was read as aluminum because that's how they spelled it
And now that's just how the word is there now. Oh my god j. Are you insinuating that all work?
Oh
I
I'm sorry. Your hands needed a little bit of a freedom touch
The americans just took it took the word and made it correct. Well, let me say correctly. They're freedomized it
Al you medium
To this conversation oh
Germany has been kicked from chat. Oh man. Stop invading places. It's fruit
It's mites now
Let's listen to the funny man calls a moron
Actually take a second to think about the film you just watched it's a completely
Unoriginal bland superhero movie that takes from taxi driver and king of comedy. It was it was pretty good. It was a pretty good movie
What if you've not seen, you know one of those films then you're ignorant
I mean I hadn't at the time and you're obviously an uncultured swine
I haven't seen those movies when I first watched this movie and I thought this movie was good
I thought this movie was good and then I watched these other ones and then they weren't as good as this one
So I don't know what to say
You're just ignorant. You're ignorant morons if you haven't seen the movies it's stealing from
That's okay. My mama loves me. Oh
What I say against me so let's look at my initial impressions of joker from the podcast
I guess that's why this is useful. It was a lot like king of comedy. Yeah, I see why you guys
Wait, but doesn't this explain everything
So he said it was good on his podcast. He changed his mind soon after and people are holding him his feet to the fire over it
Because he's he's actually like pulling this up in his video
Yeah, like he's like with himself. Did you like listen to him present this he's very bitter about this
Initial impressions of joker from the podcast. I guess that's why this is useful. It was a lot like
Yeah, I see why you guys
Mentioned it. You can already tell i'm more hopeful in this episode than I am but you're wrong
It wasn't a lot like of course you're more hopeful like tax drivers. It's fucking wrong wet sock in this video
I mean this video has a lot better likes just like race show and this one does
So it isn't us who went to the movie theater and
To say that was a good movie because we saw it once in a movie theater. It's him
It's it's him who did that he did that just picture like the six of us
Well, actually all of sardonic cast and all of us we're all sitting watching that movie
We all go. That's pretty good. And then he stands up an hour later and goes. I am enlightened. It was bad
Explain thy self peasant
Right
I really just got beaten down by society and the first half of this film is really sad right now and dour
And I like that about it all of it. See I just liked it because it was sad, but like upon watch
Criticizing your own argumentation. Have you seen this video?
I liked it because it was sad
And it fucking reminded me may I remind you it's his job to explain and analyze films I liked it because it was sad
So I could tell you idiot for thinking things are boring
What's the matter having this person money and they're like who's
Well, I mean it's not so bad
Let's say you enjoyed joker and you gave him money to explain what's wrong with it
And he called you a moron for finding a citizen came boring. That's an interesting experience
I I think man delorean is really poorly written. I think it's bad. I think it's bad
You're not a i'm not you're not an idiot for liking it
You're not stupid. Wait, why do you think i'm an idiot for liking it? What the fuck? You're not an idiot for liking it
It's fine to like you like it. Why aren't you being the crazy straw man version of yourself that people think you yeah
Already make those I don't have to be that anymore because they make them up themselves
I was just like there's things that are probably really stupid. First off. There's probably stuff. That's really really bad
That I like and I don't want to put myself in the corner of like being a hypocrite for starters
I'll be dumb a hypocrite a hypocrite
hypocrite
Cryptism
I like batman and robin sue me. Yes. I like batman and robin. I like I like alien versus predator
Fuck you. I like sucker punch suck my cock
Rags right you have the right you have the right to like like a punch
Okay, next time someone tells me they like sucker punch and they're actually in the room. I'm gonna be like
You gotta suck right stick
I cannot I cannot simultaneously
Have the position that I like sucker punch, but it's also fucking garbage
And then it's like I can't be just I can't what's the word? I can't be just
In what's the?
inconsistent with myself
Like I can recognize that's growing
It's ryan john san ryan john san
I don't know why we're bringing him up with racism. We're bringing him up because we're talking about bad movies
No, because we were talking about inconsistency
Oh, yeah
It's okay to like bad stuff
No, it's not okay
You're not like stupid
Because he didn't like the right thing. That's thing with like taxi drivers. Like I think I could pretty well substantiate the reasons
Why I don't like it and why I think it has failings in areas
You know, but like you can't crucify people because they don't like a thing
Especially the approved list of things you can like you can't where have you been rags? That's how it works
like citizen kane
sacred cow, it's like taxi driver and I don't know some other artsy fartsy bullshit movie that only
Three people watched in france that one time you can't not
Cheese movie the cheese movie film the cheese
What do you mean you didn't like
He does that indie fudge film about a cook he's getting his way through the life
You do that enjoys the feed
Just a murdering psychopath
Kills people by choking them to death with a big slice of brie
He just shoves the shoves the cheese down
There's a different kind of cheese and he's working his way through the kinds of my boss my boss is a big slice of stinky
Uh stinky looned burger cheese
But my wife she is a lovely slice of cheddar
Yeah
Except it's not coming to any theaters unless you live in le pense de few in france
The only place in the world it has been
Does in the middle that's half an hour of a completely black screen where nothing happens?
It is
very symbolic
I like the indie french film ratatouille. It is filmed from inside
Is left homage man
better
You've not experienced cinema until you've seen like so much the themes in ratatouille are better
They talk about how being a critic is correct and you should hate everything
Well, like I hate everything yes
He knew what was up he knew what was up
His name is just like i'm a good critic. Yes, thanks to ratatouille
I just liked it because it was sad but like
Multiple times it's like was there anything deeper going on in those parts? Not really?
It's a surface level scene. Oh, you're down on writing sympathy trick 101 just happened to be beaten up a bunch
Well, can you just say this about anything?
God damn it
I'm forgetting that writing sympathy for any character or bad things happen to him because well things happen to you
Just take like well
He's about a guy who's loses sled left for lunch
Oh something bad happened to you. So we're supposed to pity you. What do I look like human? Uh, the Incredibles. That's a great film
Uh the Incredibles is about a guy who this works out and becomes a
Just going back to his old life
Wants to be superhero. What kind of movie is that?
Normally when I see people getting beat up. I'm like, man, that's shit
That's not good. Well, yeah, but that's what he's saying. It's like ha ha that's the they've tricked you into feeling sympathy
Because that's the easy way to do it
I just don't like that logic
I'm okay with taking this seriously as like a character study
But then when you do to help more into the well, basically the dumb shit when the dumb shit starts what dumb shit
Citation needed. Maybe he will
Okay, stop being h-bomb again. Fuck
He's allowed to do that do what say claim that you need citations what no
You stole it boo to jay
No, that's fucking scientific jealous of me because of my cameo. It was invented by earl philosopher back in
1982
You are a hunk of stinky limber
Yeah, he said citation needed to his student and the student was so shocked they died, but I am a beautiful white slice
This is beautiful white or beautiful white yes
I mean, I mean i'm sorry. I mean, I mean we
Yeah, that's better
Seriously, it's like a character study
But then when you do to help more into the well, basically the dumb shit when the dumb shit starts then it's like well
This tonally isn't really working for me because now i'm thinking about killer croc in the penguin
Whoa, what what explain the scene?
What leads you to that what yes
Explain what you know this killer crocodile man
How can I not just apply this to the dark night?
Like people treat the dark night as the best superhero movie of all time
Surely they do as well. I'd be like, how could I take it seriously would kill a croc in the universe?
That's not fair
Well, let's let's listen to it again, let's make sure don't want to be taking anybody's tisms out of lizards
Well, basically the dumb shit when the dumb shit starts then it's like well
This tonally isn't really working for me because now i'm thinking about killer croc in the penguin and toothpaste and all this
Like this this is very strange to me
Killer crocodile and combat wombat and bullshit like that
Like this is a very grounded realistic simple movie and if you're thinking about killer anthropomorphic crocodiles
It's a kind of I don't know what say well
I would love to know what scene makes me think about killer crocodile. It's in the ip. So there
Yo
What are you saying? Are you saying that you're applying meta knowledge to your interpretations of film?
He couldn't take it seriously because he knows about killer croc
Oh
Well, at least this guy doesn't make fucking movie reviews on youtube living because that'd be fucking rags. He does
Oh my god, it's that's strange because I wouldn't have guessed that based on the things he said here
Well, you know you're moron. So
Uh, well, i'm 14 years old. I got a lot of time to develop
Easy way to tell if you're intelligent or not
boring
I'm, sorry you cut out. I don't understand the question and I don't want an easy way to find out if you're intelligent or not
Right. Have you ever found a film boring?
uh moron
Um
The fact that he's not even sure means he's a moron
I don't even know have you when you watched left from large. Did you think it was boring? No left from range
It was deep as my soul
At the pit of the marion the stretch
Hot
It was actually very cold
No, it's quite warm there. Don't you?
My love has a lift me
My heart is good. You just touched jace. That was an unrelated screen
That makes it worse actually
Okay
The scream was incidental to rex touching with me. Yeah, I just wanted to clarify
This is very strange to me can I tell you a theory my mom had what for this film go ahead
So there's a little person in this film
Yes, and and her theory once she once the movie's over. She called me and said I think that guy in the sequel
Is going to become the penguin?
So here's the thing I know the route's a liar now so who knows if that's true
But like is that what you're gonna be?
Is that what you're gonna base everything off?
Okay
But why is that in here
The argument leads you to you cannot have
Character studies in superhero universes because then you just talk you can imagine all the other characters in universe. It doesn't hold up
Okay, it's it's not
It's not a good argument to make king that's straight. Although there's going to be the riddler
I'm just sure murray would be the vulture way. That's a different ip
The guy selling the hot dogs who has a limp. That's the riddler. That's that's the riddler
Oh my no, that's the hot that's the hot dog
That's the hot dog
Fucking point out a hot dog. It's me. There's no no worse villain in the batman roster than the hot dog
I
Don't tell me that's first off don't tell me that stupid when you have killer croc and the penguin don't forget steamboat
Yep
Do you think the midget will become the hot dog
I couldn't buy this film. It made me think hot dog
It's over she called me and said I think that guy in the sequel is going to become a penguin
Your mom doesn't call you to the violins telling you how sad you're supposed to feel
Oh
This is not a sad scene
This joker being happy you have a 10 year or two
Let's go
What is what is the criticism?
The music is telling me to feel a certain emotion
It's like what what else is music meant to do in a film? Is this supposed to accentuate the tone slash experience of the scene?
The music is supposed to supposed to be like random songs and you're like
You had to be suicide squad where they just play the radio in the background of the film
No, the music is so you don't get bored. Oh shit. I saw it
Like if you don't actually enjoy the film in the pictures and close your eyes and enjoy the soothing tunes of our
Soundtracks
Also, holy shit, like you can't go for the soundtrack of joker like that shit was great. So good. Yeah
So sad and melancholy. It was done by Hilda
Cooling appropriate
Guten tag lays off the idea of the instability of his mind with the cords that resonate
With the pogs the poor no, I didn't support cords. No, it would have been perfect
The joker did his dancing thing to bohemian rhapsody
They have harmonic dissonance
Ah such a lame criticism you got to develop it. Let's see if he does
Film video
Also, we've got to be really careful because music is like even three seconds of detection and we're done so
All right, this maybe this is what got him hit with copyright actually
Okay
Then there's a cutaway to him in the asylum and he hits his head against the door
It's his head against the door
Oh
That was corny this is it whoa, what whoa, what i'm i'm sorry what he never backs anything up
Let's just give him the benefit of that. What does corny get to find us?
Try dude, what the fuck
What is what okay jump i'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, i'm sorry
I was being assassinated and my teammate was right there
Why are you playing video games?
Hey you racers
Or are you mar? What are you googling? I'm googling. So the definition of corny got trite banal or morkishly sentimental
How come it's not pronounced banal
maynal
All right
I don't know which of these he's referring to and I don't know how he defines each of them like give me a give me a
Fucking rope. I need to help ralph. Help me. Oh, don't hang yourself. Not over there
No, I meant like a rope to help me climb out of something
Man I was so fucking ready. This is a dead fucking genre
Where is super I was so fucking ready for there to be
Le fromage fan art and then someone said hot dog. I was like, oh, that's where it's going. I am
liraga is the hot dog layer
That is that is inappropriate for this child friendly christian stream stream we're 14 year olds
Yeah, we are they might as well as christian. Why can't we be like, uh, uh,
Worman buddhist stream. We are the progressive muslim stream
Protestant stream. Ah
That's still christian. Wait, can we be unitologists piece be a bunny? What's the unitologist? Is that the study of united states?
Study of unitologists are the Scientologists from space
That was corny. This is a dead fucking genre the superhero genre you're doing
It's not a fucking superhero in it
It's not the name of the superhero. What do you mean dead genre? There's so many different kinds of superhero
But especially if he fucking classifies this as superhero. Yeah
Fucking anything will be super film
I just we did this because yms was on um efap and we would like we get this criticism. I'm just like
You know what?
What are the how do you see guardians of the galaxy as the same as thor ragnarok as the same as iron man one?
As the same as homecoming as this and you just go on and on logan. Obviously we're in the same genre
Fucking king of comedy and taxi driver the same it's a character who's like how can you argue that it's a dead genre though?
It's going so strong at the moment. Maybe I guess he means dead creatively. I don't know
well, that's giving some charity, I guess I have to because
This video is rambling nonsense. I have to make something out of it
He's being a silly sausage. Well, we could actually have a discussion if I steal about him
Okay within your best most of the valuable superhero ip is owned by disney
And they're not going to do anything. What do you mean valuable superhero ip?
Like well, that's clearly not the fucking case now, is it?
Right, so you got well
Man made a shit ton of money suicide squad made a lot of money joker made a lot of money batman versus
Super person may have money
If by valuable he's referring solely to um, how much money they can potentially make
Then uh dc still put a dent into what marble can make like dc like hey, we're still here. You haven't beaten us
Um, secondly if he means valuable just by like they've owned all the people who're gonna make money
So it's like damn way to fucking just be like well give up if you're not dc or marvel
Well in this case give up if you're not marvel
Yeah, if you ain't disney then just go fucking kill yourself
Interesting with it they put it through the same process they do with any everything else the pixar movies
The animated how the fuck are you relating this to joker?
Like I I have no idea. They do our movies
They put it through the same process. What do you mean?
Is that what is that the words that you just made with your mouth?
Yeah
On a way so he's not comparing this to joker. We'll be comparing it to everything disney does in general
So, how do you compare this to something like endgame?
Um, it has characters in it that's not good enough
Wait, is your address to the live-action movies like the lad? Oh
What is this point right now? What is this boy? The new stars movies it's all straight out of the printer
Oh my god, that's very blessed like as big as a fishy
It's all straight out of the printer and that's warner brothers competition
Um
No, no, no, no, no
Good damn it. Okay. Keep keep your fucking video game commentary to yourself. You absolute disgusting creature
You're fucking camping pieces. I I can't i'm too important
Um, so this isn't really like some masterful art film. It's a studio piece of crap
So that's that's that's that's an ad hominin. All right, ad hominem argument about a film. So that was
He's completed the argument so he set up that all of the
This is how the argument went your valuable ip's in relation to comics being made into movies. That's disney
Disney do with them what they do with everything like their animated movies and their remakes whatever
Meaning that they're all printed. They're all like soulless copy printed out. That's what they all the comic book movies are
That is warner brothers competition. Therefore warner brothers have to do that to be able to compete. Therefore joker is
creatively bankrupt
That's an ad hominem argument
It's a fucking ridiculous argument
You could even say that it's almost like the opposite where you have to be creative if someone says all right
We need to make a movie about this topic or this universe or something
But you gotta make it good. So that's where the creativity comes in
How do I work within these certain constraints to make something that's really good? No, sorry
I don't remember you being this noisy when I played halo with you. Yeah
That's because i'm playing headhunter. It's really intense. I lost a load of heads before I died. You're in a tent
After I died when I died and then that's the only noise I made it was entirely restrained
You know lots of play games on your job. You know that yes
I am
Point was I don't like this argument. Okay, I agree
It was competition
So this isn't really like some masterful art film. It's a studio piece of crap
Disguised as a thoughtful character study like a like a transformer
Like a transformer
Are you I am mad
Actual artistic film disguised as a studio piece of crap well, yeah, hang on a second Oscar bait in disguise
Oscar Oscar bait in disguise Oscar bait more than skies more than you so but the whole point of being bait is that
You're not in disguise. You want to catch the Oscar, but you're you're not you look like you're trying to catch the Oscar
But you really want to make a good film. Okay, I think I get where he's going
Was his point that they're just gunning for the Oscar, but they're trying to make it look like they're not gunning for the Oscar
Yeah, it's like we want to get a bunch of oscars. We're not really we actually made a shit movie
How we fooled them?
Just fucking leave if you're gonna do that Jesus Christ
Jay, this is important. We're talking about joker. Um, I'm gonna do my best not to do that again. So like
the uh
The criticism that it's like creative bank of photocopied Oscar bait film. I just be like, hmm. Okay. What's your evidence?
Like oh shit. We've gone through that part
I didn't realize like oh god, it was so bad study. It's like a like a transformer
Oscar bait in disguise
Joker is not a good movie
Unsubscribed lover is not a good movie. Mike's still claws. Yeah, fuck you bag. It's fucking mouth
What's your fucking mouth it's true, you know, I said something that was wrong on the internet people are
You're edgy. I probably made all those people on 4chan upset
The movie maker should be at the bottom of every list
So this is the part where you just come here people give him anyone anyone notice anything?
I just have a post date post date post date
Sunday 25th of june 2017 by a second
What year did joker come off your piece of shit again, why did you why did you dig this up?
Did you save this when this when this first happened those many years ago
Kept this in your catalog screen shot at it
Like if I ever need to show a picture of someone saying something bad about me on the internet
I can always pull up this one screenshot
Maybe like see this one fucking anonymous guy on the 4chan reddit
He said that you know, I always should be at the bottom of every list search for chan for his own name and then produced
wait
He's gone from attacking attacking the audience and fans and and things all those people
Just throwing jabs at them throughout the review. I was just directly doing it
Found like a random comment from an add-on a three year ago 4chan thread like what the fuck?
This is weird
Proves it how did he get here? Was this like setup to be that it's about joker?
Get it. You're edgy. Did he write all those people on 4chan upset? Did ralph write this himself?
He write his own
Disparaging comment so just so he could screenshot it. He's playing the long game
He's been waiting on that for a long time
Wait, I want to I want to close this one commenter on 4chan
He was so smart. He knew that my joker take would be so shit
Insightful commenter very insightful
You got these comments say why this is pretty good, but take shit too serious
No, I like how seriously take stuff
Uh, I like listening stuff watching to double toasted and brad jones midnight screenings. Okay, uh from the few ralph videos i've said
Oh, no, it skipped
Go back
Boom from the few ralph videos i've seen he's probably one of the worst he pretty much
He's pretty much movies brought to life. I don't know what that means
I don't know what that means either
Also, this is I don't want some movies to be brought to life like duress and park because there'll be dinosaurs everywhere
tuckman greater than john's greater than rlm really
Why would you call him cuckman and say he's better than those two
Maybe he's talking about stuckman
I mean that's that's what I mean. Okay, the new figure should be at the bottom of every list
Literally no substance. I mean, it's not like this video had substance so far
Yeah, explain to me why it doesn't you have to give
An example of a part of the movie where people say wow, this is really deep. This is really meaningful
And then you have to explain no, this is why that is bad. God damn it
I don't want your amateur sex videos
Wait, you make your own
No, I could I I don't but like if I wanted amateur sex videos, I go to the six trillion that are already on the internet
Are you sure that number's correct? No, it's not correct. I'm definitely low balling it
That doesn't mean it's a great film it doesn't stand on its own
What do you mean by that? What do you mean?
On its own what is it?
I thought we proved that when is he saying that like it wouldn't have made a million without being called joker
I'd be like that doesn't mean it doesn't stand on its own as a story
Yeah, how much money does it have to make in dollars to stand on its own?
13. Oh my god, it's dead on its own a lot
Um artistic intent
In my opinion the film didn't feel like it was crafted with a clear artistic intent
It felt like phoenix saved a sub-par script and production
The studio really wanted him and were willing to budge on his demands
Todd phillips didn't bring much to the story. Wow shot composition lighting and scene direction were all standard
Thanks internet man
You know, this reminds me of when jay from red light media said that uh, tod phillips isn't a real filmmaker
Oh god, what a fucking retarded thing to say like jay gets so far up his own asshole sometime. I can't believe I did that
Well, I was just gonna say like it's uh, it's the same energy like ralph
You gotta you gotta climb you gotta claw your way back out of your asshole. You're stuck in there. Yeah
Come frolic in the sunshine with the rest of it
He's trying to but he's just stuck in his ass. He's in the field like help
I hope I can't like things
Wait rags, what was the one that game you were talking about earlier like butt fucker or something?
Ass hunter that's the one
Close enough I suppose
There's butt fucking an ash hunter
Yeah, thank you. I found it. I played it and I tried it and I couldn't figure out was it you
You shoot the homosexuals in the woods
That's where they spawn
That's where they breed with mushrooms
The homosexual consumes the mushroom and gives birth to upwards of 17 new homosexuals spawn from spores
We must eradicate the homosexual problem
Oh, no
Gave this crew a lot of leeway to make this film especially
And I think that's why this film turned out as good as it did of course, I don't know what
As good as it did I thought you hate the movie I guess when he says as good as it did he's referring to like
I guess that's why it's a five out of ten and not a zero or something like that. I don't know
Fucking say the things you mean and don't make it so cryptic. Yeah, you gotta you gotta interpret because yeah, this script
Gotta be subtle
Script is leaking. I don't know what's from the script what's improvised scene by scene
But I have a feeling all of the worst stuff in this film is the stuff that came from the script and all of the moments
That were interesting and unique mainly came from phoenix himself
You can't just say that wow just wow
So I didn't like that probably they had they deserve no credit
What is he gonna elaborate or is this literally him just being like, what do you think?
Established information about ralph the movie maker. He just said before this that he can't know for sure. But this is his assumption
Oh, if he said he doesn't really know that makes it okay. Yeah
Um ralph, I don't think that you wrote any of your videos. I think you've got a ghost writer that does all of it
That's giving him too much credit. Yeah, all the good parts are just well
Yeah, all the shitty parts are you anything that was ever done good on your channel rags ralph the movie maker
Uh, you had a ghost creator there you had a ghost creator that did all of it
Ghost youtuber according to him. There were some really radical changes made to the film from script to set that whole fridge scene was improvised
How much of okay improvising that i'm sorry. I'm imagining just improvising that where someone's like, that's not the script
Someone's like watching what are you doing filming filming camera roll?
That's just what he does normally
On set
A trailer he just lives in the fridge. Oh, apparently he gave this a four out of ten by the way
out of
What?
Ralph
Well, that that's your opinion. You you utter that is a fact. You can't say that word unless you're a gamer
Yes, I am because I am one. No, you're not I disapprove. Well, you are white so kind of cancels out
Black persons who say the n-word then I can say the f-word and I can say retard. That's correct
I like it. Yes
This is purposeful because when I do see taxi driver and king of comedy every scene feels purposeful and you said this already
It's fucking lie this phone you have a really corny bad scene the whole batman connection. What the fuck was that?
What just happened? That was not all right
I'm steering at the timer and i'm gonna watch it and if it skips over in seconds
I will tell the audience because that I don't think was me
Purposeful and in this film you have a really corny bad scene the whole batman
This film was totally pointless if we're going to go with the whole
Wait, yeah, sorry now now i'll actually listen to his point
So I was distracted by his shitty audio and in this film you have a really corny bad scene
The whole batman connection in this film was totally pointless. There is no batman connection. There's no batman in this film
Not at all. No batman whatsoever. He's not even mentioned
Why would he be?
Wouldn't make any sense. It's like a kid. It just zooms into the kid. He's go. I'll be batman
listen son
As as thomas swain later dying
Blood pulling around him. He reached out to his son. He said son
I hope you dress up as a bat one day
You know what they should have had is uh when when joker came up to him
He was playing with a little toy bat. He was like i'd like to be a bat one day
The joker's like, oh, that's so cute. Oh look aquaman's over there
Yes, like I would like to criticize you
But it's up to the clown for a living so I get a little room too
If we're going to go with the whole theory that everything after the fridge is a dream
Then why the hell would joker imagine that bruce swain's parents would be killed. I don't care about your stupid dream argument
Yeah, why would we think that that's the thing that could happen if the scenes in the film are watched? Yeah
Also, someone asked if this would be the that that would have been a result of him having to trim the music
Uh, this was this was copied before he trimmed the video. Um
So as far as i'm aware there is no trim in this one and that we would we've just been careful with copyright
It's such a specific thing to imagine
Like for example now i'm gonna pause
Um, what do you mean a specific thing to imagine?
What why would joker it like let's just go with it for a second that someone said this was something he imagined and now ralph is saying
General like he couldn't have imagined this that's that's stupid. It's like couldn't have imagined that uh
the wane child that could have is living the life the joker feels that he could have had if
That you know thomas wane was actually his dad and that
Yeah, that's kind of why I think he finds it funny he's like why couldn't he imagine this I don't understand
And that also happens to tie in with batman
You keep seeing batman
Funny is it is this guy supposed to be alfred? No, he is alfred
This guy is supposed to be alfred maybe it's alfred's brother fucking idiot trying to be alfred
What is what is this criticism?
Is halloween trick-or-treating is alfred
But like genuinely how does he what is he delivering with this like he's fucking alfred. What is this?
Well, it's not funny is it is this guy supposed to be alfred you shouldn't be speaking to his that's it like
I actually thought we'd cut him off
That's it
Supposed to be alfred all right moving on is this supposed to be an ambulance
What is this?
Who else is he supposed to be he's supposed to be?
He doesn't look like a crazy guy
The other crazy guy who wanted to like take advantage of bruce wayne joker just kind of stepped on his game
He just said bruce grows up to be alfred
He's like man being rich gets you killed i'm just gonna be a fucking butler
I'm just trying to make him a smile, but it's not funny. Is it is this guy supposed to be alfred?
You shouldn't be speaking to his son for the first 25 minutes of this film. You know, it's supposed to be gotham
I kind of want to cut now
You wait, what I just want to use that little cut
This guy's supposed to be alfred
That might be the most bizarre part of this whole video
Is this guy supposed to be alfred?
I don't get it. What's going on? Is this guy alfred?
Am I supposed to be murray?
Are you supposed to be joker? This is supposed to be gotham
Is walking phoenix a joker?
Oh, I should I haven't been gedelbing anywhere near enough in this one. I feel bad
This guy supposed to be alfred
I'll never know. We'll never know that guy's alfred. I feel like that might become a meme
Is this guy supposed to be alfred?
I want that clip. This guy's supposed to be alfred?
Is this alfred?
Somebody's gonna make that video just from a series of clips of just not alfred. Is this guy supposed to be alfred?
Is this guy supposed to be alfred?
I was like, yes
That's why he's named alfred and he's the butler for the way in family. They're alfred now. They're alfred now
I don't even like get it. He's supposed to be alfred
Oh, what a good funneling moment in this general the general of the continent alarming first president of the us
Is this supposed to be george?
Is this supposed to be batman?
You shouldn't be speaking to his son for the first 25 minutes of this film. You don't even know. Was that alfred?
Oh my god
What what why do you need to know it's gotham five minutes?
They must be terrible imagine learning something late in the film that you didn't know
What did he say? I will I will I will play it again
Is this guy supposed to be alfred
You shouldn't be speaking to his son for the first 25 minutes of the film you don't even know it's supposed to be gotham
it's just a city and I
Funny thing to say for him because he complains constantly result all started universe so bad. Oh, we don't know. It's gotham
The first 25 is alfred. You can't you can't bitch that something is so obvious and then bitch that all we don't know
What is gotham in the first 25 minutes gotham? Is this the joker?
Is this alfred supposed to be gotham?
This guy is a building. He's like is this supposed to be alfred?
Jay logbo said are those stairs supposed to be alfred
Every single step is alfred
I walk up and down alfred every day. No, this is bad. I walk down alfred to work and I walk up alfred
Supposed to be alfred
About the same set of characters again
It wasn't like oh harley quinn is gonna show up now
And then they're gonna fight killer croc just because I have negative things to say about the film
I'm, sorry. What just happened? I need to I don't even know what happened
I need to repeat that because I would go all the way back to the great quote. I mean, I hate the film
Oh wait shit
Shit go back to the quote I need it
Oh, I went really far back. Whoops
It's too far, but it's not funny is it is this guy supposed to be alfred
For the first 25 minutes of this film you don't even know it's supposed to be gotham
It's just a city and I like that aspect of it
It wasn't about the same set of characters again. It wasn't like oh harley quinn is gonna show up now
Oh and then they're gonna fight killer croc just because I have so good. He said that was a good thing. Okay. Yeah
All right. Yeah fine. Okay. It's weird to just throw that in
It's like, I don't know. It's
Gotham the first 25 minutes. That's great. It's quite a strange thing to put in this video
Talking about is this person alfred?
To say about the film does not mean I hate the film okay does not mean I think it's a worthless
I just don't think it's perfect. I don't think it okay. Okay. Let's be honest. You're going way further than saying it's not perfect. Yeah
You're talking about how shallow and empty it is and how it's made for 14 year olds, okay
That honestly that to me kind of feels a bit like backpedaling because he's he's late in the script now
He's like, hey look i'm just saying it's not perfect. All right, it's like you what after everything you just said
Instead of going
And if you think that i'm wrong, then you're a bad you're a 14 year old
You moron sounds like a real late. Imo card to be honest. Yeah, like go try this a little earlier probably
Deserves the golden lion. I don't think it's a masterpiece
Oh, wow, he actually fucking shows that clip
I would have changed my vote to lie. Okay
It's a lie in this direction he's being willfully mis willfully dishonest. It's a lie actually
Put the clip in how do you fucking do this?
It's all his opinion. All right, fuck
Oh, no, he's showing me he slapped through it. Oh you
His dog is giving him the eye. He's like man. You better not come near my ass
This is a parody. This is a parody. This has been a complete lie
I just like the idea that the dog is like this skit isn't funny. I'm, sorry
It's like mate's dog is that tissues under his couch what the fuck like cotton
Why is there loads of cotton under his couch? I don't want to know could be
He secretes his cotton
That's what he secretes. Do you not?
Uh, not on not on thursday's and not on the floor because you're not a dirty animal
No, I do it in my face savage
That's not like I don't i'm not saying the movie is terrible. I don't hate the movie and then this shows
Like okay, yeah, I believe you well wouldn't surely this counts for saying it's boring
Yeah
So does that mean he's a moron? I guess that means he's a moron
Let go let that do what sounds do you make with someone straggling you
I go
That's the noise of me I go please stop sir, I do not appreciate losing access to my windpipe
Um, I well, what depends what what's the safe word in the situation boonga?
Uh, then I don't say that. Oh, all right. Yeah
God this one is boring, isn't it?
You've said it twice
So now I am wondering if this is a parody
I got a bit it man. Let the dog go. The dog does not want to be hugged, right?
It's so boring. Oh, no
It's based on my favorite comic book character. You can't follow me
Dude that that dog is uncomfortable. Let's say look how small my peepee is. Yes. Yes you did. All right. Okay
Wait, I got on the comment section of my show you have the gall to criticize a movie like joker. Fuck you
I think he cut some uh, that's a little bit. Let's look at the full comment. I guess
That's quite a good joke
All the criticism of like joker after giving it price previously
I'm going to go back on your own portfolio with cheaply made schlock like this
I think you should refocus your directional style acting cinematography
Realize me your series sucks. Is this all like this is clearly he's like this is a fabricated comment, right?
I don't know
I could believe this comment exists
Okay. Yes
Um, you know, you're right actually wait, how could you because this this would be posted
No, it can't be a comment on the video that's it's been posted in yeah, um
What would this be posted on if it's about critic because he was
He was friendly to joker in the podcast one, right? Unless this is on the podcast one. I don't know
The gall to criticize a movie like joker fuck you the gross
Overreaction to this film is hysterical. I I know look at your video. It's kind of crazy
At least he was as honest and covering that comment as he is
As he was honest covering the joker. Yeah
All consistent yet. It's an amalgamation of things you liked from when you were six years old
You like the joker cartoons you like the joker comic book
But really it's just an okay movie as far as the cinematography is concerned. I guess it's shot. Well, but it's not
Structure is garbage. Also you already liked it because you liked stuff from when he was six
It's like damn that age just keeps getting lower. Don't it? Yeah
I didn't I didn't want to watch the joker when it first came out, but then I learned that it was
Doing something all on its own and then I wanted to watch it
Yeah, I checked it out because I like the trailer a lot I was like this looks cool
It looked like it was his own thing. That's just because it was the joker
It's not precise. There were better looking movies this year joke. Okay
There are better looking movies this year, okay guys
moving on
So if it's not the best it's just not worth celebrating
No, it's garbage
Walker's an exceptional movie. Okay, what's the exceptional part? This is exceptional
I'm sorry. What what just happened? Is that supposed to be alfred?
I'll just show clips out of context is it oh
Oh
What do you think you're achieving with that montage
What what's not even Joaquin phoenix's best performance we're still talking why are you saying this?
I don't why why are we back to it has to be the best in order to celebrate? What's
That's my noise, oh man about batman we've made batman movies for fucking 60 years
Can we talk about a film that's original, please? You had you could talk about whatever you want
We've been talking about the joker for so long because people keep them
There's different jokers, okay, there's different jokers different iterations from batman and
Identities to the joker. That's why people that's why he survived for so long
I'm starting to actually be like is is this a joke because there's so much tism in this
Do their joke is just really you really bitter with himself
Because he liked the movie and now he for some reason he hates the movie for strange reasons
Is this video supposed to be alfred? That's the answer
That's right
The beginning of this movie is boring as hell something bad happens to joker. I thought we weren't allowed to say stuff is boring
I don't understand the rules. I think he said that I think he said like good films
You're not allowed to say boring. That's fine. Because it's no because he said
Apply this to any film that people say is boring
But I think the implication of that was good films that people say. Yeah. Well, it's not what he said, is it jay?
I think it was implicit in the subtext. I think that you're implicit in the subtext of lies
I think you're alfred. Well
Can we verify it rags you alive by the way
Rags
Bronkdoll go down
Man down man down
They play some sad violin music rinse and repeat it gets a little better when joker's making faces with this kid
But then joker starts having a laughing fit and has a card with his condition. What's wrong with that? Yeah
Okay, that part was okay
But then they have to play the sad violin music to remind you that this is a sad scene instead of just fitting music
With a scene fitting the emotionally doesn't like violins violins bad. I don't know
Violins are bad. You know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna play him the world's smallest violin. No, he doesn't like them stop
That's my way of punishing him him
Those violins are a mistake. Give me a break. I like
Do you actually think those violins are a mistake? No can't have a
Your main the main character of your movie could never have their own theme
It can't have a musical cue when they come on stage. It's that's ridiculous. No good movie does that apparently
Holy shit, we're nearly through it. Yeah, we're actually this has been quite a long stream
There's no way it's not even half over, but hey
Wait, what do you mean? It's not it's just like this video one of two. No, no, it's super chaz. Oh
Oh, right. Yeah that hat exists. Yeah break with I like deniro and I get what people like about this character
It's a cartoonish tv host, but there's nothing more to it
He just serves to be a father figure metaphor. He's not cartoonish at all. He's like considering his screen time
He's quite well fleshed out as a person. Yeah, what he what he he's more complex believes than being a cartoon
He's not like i'm gonna humiliate you you fucking idiot. That's not
We've already we've already covered this
Yeah, we actually yeah, we did he's when he said there was only one dimensional character
It's like nope joker's story and that's it. He doesn't actually have a character. See that by the way folks
So he made a 24 minute video my video on joker if I ever make it it's probably gonna be like two hours
And so it's like so ralph is more concise than you and i'd be like no
Actually, there's a good chance he repeated his points more than I will in that two hours
Hmm, um goodness will happen. You don't have structure. He's talked about this. He's talking about it again
He's repeated himself a whole bunch of times in this video
Wow maula takes opportunity to say his work is good. Wow
I think anybody who doesn't repeat themselves is someone who doesn't repeat themselves
Say that again. That's true. I can't it's against the law
Say that again, it's illegal
Or wants desires does he have a family like
It's a parody. It's like recco him for a dream. So everybody's heard about the super rats that are in guys
Super rats, you know fellas
Oh, he did a silly impression of his voice
What are we supposed to do with that? It's it's been a bulk of his critique. There's doing silly impressions of what people say
Well, like when he played the music and he was going blah blah blah
Oh, you're nailing it dude. That's been the bulk of his critique just big
Repeat
This is just this film has made me angry, but it's irrational. So i'm just gonna have to make an irrationally active video
Makes complete sense
Chokes that are ironically bad instead of actually writing jokes. That would be funny
You know what I mean folks these super rats you ready for this it's still funnier than jimmy kimmel
Why did we cut to a shot behind him that's rotating around him? Did james wan direct this?
I'm sorry
What?
What's what's happening on screen right now because i'm not looking
Is it is it is it was a shot behind a niro?
The shot behind a niro and it cycles around him as he's talking
Apparently that's bad
That is bad
It's terrible. We cut to a shot behind him. That's rotating around him. Did james wan direct this i'm sorry. I think it's boring
I mean even rocky doesn't seem interested
Is he described as boring three times after saying the boring thing? It's interesting three four times already, you know
I think he meant something else by them. I think we are being an autism by taking it literally
I think you'll be way too kind to not hold him accountable for the statements he makes
But I think the subtext was quite implicit and we've already had this discussion you're wrong
You're wrong you're wrong i've said it twice, which means i've repeated myself and I lose
This movie is bad, but i'm not saying it's bad
When jared leto heard that warner brothers was greenlighting a joker film starring guacine phoenix and not him
He was reportedly upset by it. But here's the thing. Jared leto you're acting
What are you
Where do you live
Oh god that film she said or some way it's a combination of his acting
Make it so bad
Man that's what a bad film are supposed to be alfred
Looks kind of like alfred
And there was apparently like enough footage to give this guy his own movie and they edited it down to five minutes
And all that was left
I wonder if he's gonna say that because he's zooming in on the damaged tattoo
So was this buffoon with tattoos on his forehead, you know, some of the criticism is is so
Uh
Over the top vitriolic, but I bet if jared leto had a full film to flesh out this character
It would have been better. Maybe maybe sure
Actually, I completely take that back. The truth is no one I mean, I don't think anyone tonight it would be better
In terms of a stadium, right?
I think more of it is what I think more of that is just bad
It depends what criteria we're working with here in terms of like bringing a more cohesive understanding of this character
Like I don't know
Yeah, but I think to have more cohesive understanding of that character would be worst. Yeah
Doesn't doesn't ralph like this joker better because he plays it but he is about as subtle as the king of comedy
He has word damage right on his forehead
Oh, well, that is subtle. It's subtle. It's the king of comedy level of subtlety
So that's good, right would be able to stand this version of joker for more than five minutes
Any resonant as it wants to be oh
Muddled themes and execution muddled themes
I thought he said that the theme was too obvious and singular society bad
Right truth is no one would be able to stand this version of joker for more than five minutes
So there you go. Muddled themes and execution led to a confused third act
Just you haven't proven that I don't know. Maybe he will the moment where arthur commits a murder on television was pretty good
Well, he said he hated that because he was too obvious
Yeah
Maybe maybe no, okay. Okay
Everything everything after that didn't make clear if I was
If I was supposed to be against or rooting for arthur
Maybe he wants to film to tell him how to feel does he yes, there wasn't enough music in those sections
You can also write off the entire finale as a dream sequence in arthur's head which deflates the conclusion entirely
He really is really he really wants that to be true. I feel like that dream sequence thing. He's running with that hardcore
It's so weird
This talented crew is able to bring some life into it
But when you remove them and you look at the script and the story
And the heart of what this movie is trying to say. Yeah, it is good. He's right. I'm assuming he's about to say it's good
Right. Yeah, yeah, he's about to say it's good. That's why we agree with him. Cool
I think it's a lot of ideas kind of meshed together
And something is made of it and it's definitely entertaining
But it's ultimately a combination of a bunch of other different movies, but it doesn't really come my god
I don't even want to think about writing out that sentence. He just made
It's such a gobble
Oh, I don't care if he scripted it or not. We don't speak that way when we're not scripted
We don't go it's a movie about several things that kind of come to it's like a movie
It's good. It's just lots of people involved
Well, okay, speak for yourself then
That's what I said. I said I agreed. I said, okay speak for something
It's nothing civil about it
Oh, I see what you did. Oh, yeah nailed it
Come together and it doesn't really have a vision that that oh my god. What is it? The hell just happened? What just happened?
What just happened?
A combination of a vision that cock gonna keep keep gonna keep my eye on the timer
See if we're skipping or she's skipping different movies, but it doesn't really come together and it doesn't really have a vision that that
Oh my god
He doesn't have a vision that cock
What?
Very valid point there. He doesn't have a vision that cock
Like maybe you want to fix that I don't know
It's a parody
It's not a good parody either like do you take a parody or lie and you take your choice? I suppose
It's fucking i'm sorry. I want to have an anomaly of a video
It doesn't have a vision that cock
Maybe he's testing out like this new ai that writes like that he puts all of his
Videos into and it uses like
I can't believe this was made by an ai. Yeah
Yeah, that's supposed to be aliford. I think so
