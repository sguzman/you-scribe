do do do do do do i'm just waiting on spyro i'm excited for that did you did you hear about by the
way uh rags actually showed me the the tweet about it but apparently that would thrust like
what it was new videos oh whichever video he like ripped off the script it's from like august or
something apparently from like they ripped off the script from what some like i don't even know i
guess like a guy wrote an article or something i didn't look too far into it um it was let me
i i've actually got it right here that was august 7th um the the video uh this video by the channel
downward thrust ripped entire paragraphs from my book on final fantasy seven they eventually cited
me after i complained i guess the writer thought nobody had read the book he's not far from the
mark but one of my 12 fans alerted me oh he says it was mostly verbatim copying wow see and this
is what i mean i can't remember how long ago or what podcast it was on but i'm pretty sure me and
wolf talked about um downward thrust's whole thing is he looks and threads and articles and he finds
what it is what what you're supposed to say about the topic what's what's the current leading
perspective on it and then you'll just say that because um he just doesn't have his own fucking
feelings about stuff obviously he's a bit of a robot as we've also gone over but today is not
about downward thrust unfortunately um hello everyone how how do you do i see a couple people
have already flown right in how wonderful um we're we're we're well i guess we should we'll we'll
mention first that as of the the last podcast with cinema sin sins um a couple people we're
frustrated with the fact that we in any way discuss politics being that of the latest
controversy with um i don't even know is it is it senator kavanagh or brett kavanagh um judge
kavanagh what yeah now judge kavanagh the way i guess it was just before but now he's a bigger judge
um so the old judge this really shouldn't even be a partisan issue yeah so i wanted to clarify i
didn't know it was partisan i thought we were just discussing a concept being well it shouldn't be a
partisan yeah that's the thing the concept is it revolves around the idea of you're not guilty
until someone can prove you're guilty and that um you need to have evidence or you need to have
corroboration with your testimony in order to you know give your accusation some weight especially
if you wait 36 years and can't remember when it happened where it happened or how you got there
or how you got back or anything like this um and yeah i would think that both republican democrat
libertarian everyone with a brain yeah would be like oh yeah the presumption of innocence as
a concept is very important and we can't let random accusations ruin people's lives
but apparently that was less partisan than we thought and it's certainly not an apology it's
just uh just an observation i have made and yes so to clarify uh i'm not sure if we ever said it
but um i can't promise the podcast will be 100 politics free because it's not i don't even think
that's possible like whenever you cover anything you'll randomly might slip in a thought or an idea
that to some people will come across as um of a particular party and against another so you know
as much as i appreciate people there's some people out there who are watching this podcast to be
specifically like i want no politics and i like that this podcast does not do that it's like we
cannot promise that i was talking to wolf earlier about how like my goal of my videos is to prevent
any politics from getting in but even then uh some some get in here and there and there's people
who got annoyed at me for saying that um the last jet i was clearly left leaning they were like it's
it may be left leaning but it's terrible so why ever bring that up but i was just like but it i
don't know it is like you know you realize like there's uh not much you can do about it but as for
this circumstance i i read into more of the um the people who are against his i don't know or believe
believe the fact that he's a horrible person and they were like there's a lot of stories that
weren't read or in the investigation certain sources weren't listened to and thus uh guilty
elements of it were ignored so that's their perspective and um as far as i was concerned
was it was that there was nowhere near enough evidence and that's all i knew about it wasn't
even a left or right thing yeah keep in mind it doesn't matter yeah and keep in mind the only
reason this was brought up is because i was explaining why i was banned from twitter that's
the other thing it wasn't because we wanted to tell all of you how it should go down it was
literally just explaining that wolf got booted off twitter in relation to discussing that topic
yeah i literally kavanaugh would not have even come up probably if it wasn't for the fact that
i got banned and people were wondering about it and if kavanaugh was a was a was a democrat
uh a total regressive lefty liberal type then i would say the exact same thing absolutely doesn't
has nothing to do with what is because i i disagree with a lot of the things that he thinks um he's
definitely not my ideal guy but yeah it doesn't matter that that's absolutely nothing his political
leaning has absolutely nothing to do with oh yeah i mean like just the fact that he's right wing
means that he probably uh has a lot of stances that i would personally disagree with i don't
know much about him i'd never heard of him before this situation um but i still defended him uh no
matter what party because she had no evidence to back up any of her claims and that's bullshit i
don't think we should be destroying people's lives based off of shitty evidence or lack of
evidence in general i saw a tweet and uh this is definitely paraphrasing and i'm not going to say
you know what just for the sake of it this could be totally made up because i can't remember it
exactly but i believe billy the fridge tweeted out that um he would rather a world where people
are accused of something when they're innocent instead of letting guilty people get away with
things and it's like that i don't think that was the issue really it's more about ruining someone's
life as you kind of just went over there but again this is um i would agree that it's actually
getting into the sort of the dissemination of politics at that point instead of uh commenting
on a political angle of the media that we're covering is this kind of it's really not even
politics that's in question it's the social aspect of you know guilt and innocence so the
political leanings either way don't really have anything to do with it as v put it rather well
it was social justice versus justice yeah and again we didn't necessarily even see the fact
that this was the left versus right thing and i think it's going to come up uh in future there's
going to be things that me wolf or rags will say and you guys will be like what the fuck that's
totally a politics thing and then we'll be like oh it was okay um and that's just about perspective
so all the point of us talking about this is to uh say there is not going to be zero politics on
on the podcast and i'm not sure that any podcast can basically get away with that even especially
ones that are really long and off the cuff and cover basically everybody on the political spectrum
it's gonna come up um and hopefully that's okay because uh ultimately who cares about politics
right we just want to talk about media which um speaking of which uh we did mention last time but
wolf twitter got banned and one of the last things he got to say on there extremely
controversially was that he decided that out of killing marrying and would you want to tell this
story wolf yeah um well first off uh i saw a couple people mention in the chat that my mic
was loud i turned it down a bit is it spiking on your end or it looks okay for me but i can turn
you down to match rags whatever i just want it to be okay yeah actually keep talking a second i'll
just change it as you talk okay i'm talking about things i'm gonna read off the chat long as i can
listen while i draw this works for me can't imagine henry cap okay there we go okay okay
um so yeah jared good old jared he made a video because he thinks he thinks that me and rags hate
him for some reason i don't i don't hate jared i could never hate jared i am in love with jared
it wouldn't be right someone should flip this little bit to let jared know that everything is
fine and that he doesn't need to be upset jared jared i love you there you go no home kind of
homo but not not totally so anyway he he made a there was a point in the video that i laughed
my ass off at he um he said that he was really hurt by something that i said on twitter because
someone asked me on twitter fuck mary kill er tommy yzo jerry genesis now obviously this is a
this is a partisan issue beyond all why are you why are you being political
what i'm sorry i if you marry one of them you endorse their politics
exactly which is why i married er because i'm an alt right nazi of course and i chose to
fuck tommy because tommy's kind of like he's kind of like yahweh i mean if you you can't
pass up fucking yahweh and jared's like jesus he's just too too precious and pure yeah i mean
if you kill jesus he's gonna come back anyway so i figured you know same thing with jared so
he said jared jesus has had experience dying anyway oh yeah exactly that's why i chose jared
because i firmly believe that after three days he will rise from the grave and transcend
transcend all alphas and become a higher form of life exactly so jared no we don't dislike you
it's all good you're always fun so um and yeah and so today's a lot of people concerned they
think we're responding from 42 minutes onwards no we just put it here so that you have something
to look at that's not just like a singular color so don't worry we'll start from the beginning
because there's a whole bunch to go through this could be the longest efap in history uh yeah you
get to we just wanted to make sure that you got to spend a long time looking at quinton's incredibly
punchable face so that your anger could bubble and rise throughout the course is that a cult of
violence wolf was that a cult of violence maybe i don't know so i hope i'm not violent against
myself the history and this stretches back so fucking far like this is yeah this was like at
the beginning of the year kind of like april or may so i released the critiques on star wars
then literally when i released the second one an hour after that because i always remember
because i got a huge influx of comments just saying i hate everything's made a video what
the fuck i hate it just loads of comments but i hate everything and i was like okay
i watched his video and as many of you may know i hate everything's video on star wars is like
dreadful the last jedi it's a video that just has no through line it makes no sense he's he's trying
to say that everybody's being too angry which is just like at certain points but then he's also
defending the film and arguing that it's better than people are saying it is and then he goes
back to saying like you see people have arguments like it lacks the willhelm scream or has it it's
just like what the fuck you doing and so the video is really bad and me and rags admit at that point
and i i don't know if rags got sent it by me or someone else where he found on his own but he
decided to make a response to it and it was uh i thought it was really good and um i thought it was
all right in in the response he links my video which was very kind of you by the way because i
got a big sub boost from that it was it was very very friendly and it seems we may have ruffled
feathers all that long ago and the connections are that tro the right opinion as he's called
actually proofread um i i hit everything's video which to this day we will still can't laugh at
like not laugh at because it's just i think we addressed that with him in the actual conversation
and tro correct you do realize yeah well let's let's start though let's mention that you guys
had a conversation with him and i well that's that is in the timeline we're not quite there yet
because um that comes after tro's video he um yeah okay i'll save it for that conversation
then because like like he makes his video and it's like well you can see it's two hours long
and um i remember watching some of it and just like the initial feeling was uh he's like
going going extreme going to extreme lengths to try and prove that rags was being too cruel to
why i hate everything that's like the perspective i got like the leave i hate everything alone he's
just sharing his opinions but obviously i don't yeah i mean i i think that the idea that you can
stretch it to where i hate i hate everything is is that's i don't hate i hate everything i basically
don't know anything about him other than he's a huge hypocrite when he reviews things oh yes
extremely inconsistent especially when it came to the last jedi yeah i mean the last i mean star
wars has clearly his um it's very much at least the last jedi more specifically is kind of in his
blind spot it's it's his special pleading case and that's not like i'm not saying that that's
some sort of a mark on his character that he's a bad person it's just that his video on the last
jedi was really shitty yeah and then uh we send sends video on you is really shitty but that
doesn't mean he's a bad person no i'd say he's a good guy seems very friendly and uh i was glad to
have nice conversations with him which did happen with i hate everything so there was a lot of
controversial shit in the comment section and i threw uh what you could call i guess you could
call it a mean comment that i hate everything but the fact is it started with i hate everything
saying that anybody who thinks that like you can objectively analyze is childish condescending and
something else and obviously i was just like wow you're obviously just referring to me then
because like that's i was in the crux of the video throughout that and rags obviously um
and i responded that like i used to actually like i hate everything a lot and i would actually
consider him a sort of inspiration and i was just like well so much for that some of his videos have
been really good that's that's the thing you know like his destiny 2 video was amazing yeah it was
really well researched so you went you went really far with it it was very passionate um
and so he sent me a pm on twitter saying like fine you know if you're so sure that objective
objectivity exists in art and the uh the arse jedi is objectively bad prove it and i remember wolf
just happened to be available that night i believe and he just yeah i just got off work and you were
you said something to the effect of want to talk to i hate everything with me and i was like yes
i was out the time because i remember getting your discord message for it
yeah because uh i was like this is this is a pretty important conversation it's going to be
the proof of whether or not i hate everything accepts objectivity and arts uh yeah i had my
phone and i was checking notifications at the table but i was out and about but i remember that
yeah so jeez it was five hours i believe the entire at least from the moment me and tiara
started talking to the end of the whole conversation i think it was five hours until um and it went
ridiculously well like me and wolf was surprised by how easy it was we used very few references
and a few logical loopholes to just make i had everything come across to the idea that
objectivity obviously exists in art like that was the first thing and then he said okay but
it's case by case and then we were like well obviously it's case by case and then we were like
so uh the last jedi and um it got we we did example after example after example we kept
going through the plot and picking all of the biggest things the only thing we didn't get him
on was luke he wouldn't agree that luke was uh badly handled um we brought contradictions
but he kept like saying that um you know like like the typical arguments you hear in response
right like uh luke threw his lightsaber in the other film too luke has always been tempted by
the dark side and that's why you do blah blah blah so that didn't work out too well but we got
him on loads of other topics like the the hyperdrive or yoda's lightning or whatever else like all the
different things that contradict law or the films and he we eventually it was almost a surprise i
believe wolf he sort of just went oh fuck okay fine the last jedi is pretty shit we were just like
oh okay like it sort of came out of no way we were just like fine uh now what sort of sort of
we won yeah and then um correct me if i'm wrong because i haven't listened to it since it was
recorded so i've got very vague memories but i believe he said that he wished he'd never made
his video on the last jedi yeah he said he did so into that effect yeah and he also said that um
uh that he kind of he would have liked to have talked to us before because he hadn't heard any
good arguments against the film uh-huh sure and that was fine and then i think it was like three
days later he went on sardonic cast and said that he's still not heard a single argument against uh
the last jedi now to be honest if it was if it was that close maybe he uh he recorded it before
he spoke to us but i sent him a pm to confirm and he was like yeah my mind's been changed
because uh he well he he watched a video from someone else about the last jedi i think it was
what he said to me and i was like we should talk about it sometime and he was like no i don't want
to talk about star wars anymore and i was like yeah i'd be really surprised how you could talk
with him for five hours get him to admit the movie was pretty shit and then all of a sudden
he flips and then is there a reason why this conversation isn't public yeah oh obviously yeah
so uh wolf was gonna make it public but then i had everything said he'd prefer not to and um yeah i
asked if uh because i think you brought up like him you know making a tweet about it or something
like trying to admit publicly that it happened and of course he didn't and i was like well i
had it recording anyway so i can just release the full stream and people can see it and he was
like no i don't want you to do that and so there's like throughout all of this there's loads of
moments where it's like could respond to this video or could see if we could sort it out first
in some way shape or form and um it just sort of never happened and then there was gonna be like
we're gonna you know potential to to respond to this in a full video but it's kind of ridiculously
long so it's it would be like a full series and it's like makes more sense doing a stream
and then uh by the time we organized when we would do it uh rags his streaming abilities
basically got nuked for reasons we figured out i currently for reasons i do not know and youtube
has been unable to help me with at the moment i can't stream uh this isn't because my channel's
been restricted or because it's been struck uh or i've broken the rules in any way my channel's
in perfect standing in all regards this seems to be an issue with youtube and how it interacts
with my computer specifically i believe but i will i will try new things as i am able to and hopefully
i'll be able to get streaming back up and running but that's the reason why we're not streaming this
on my channel right now and why you haven't seen a stream in a while yeah like it seems ridiculous
but there are reasons why it's taken this long to respond to this video it's like a series of loads
of different things going on in fact we tried to do this like a month ago yeah and uh i have been
speaking to tiaro as well and i would go as far as saying he's a friend of mine uh but the problem is
i don't know he he's a bit indecisive about this whole thing he's i've made him aware that we're
responding to this today so he's gonna get uh messages about it and that i have no intention
of uh holding back punches in response to punches because the fact is he made this before he knew me
so and it's still up so obviously he's uh he's gonna have to own it at this point and um it's
gonna take several shots at rags from from what i remember too um but he i have i spoke to him for
a while and he was open to the idea of uh chopping out lots of this video that's inaccurate
but um he's decided that that would give the impression that he's walking back on his
perspective as a whole and so he would rather not do that and instead leave the whole thing
and so we respond to potentially the whole thing and then it's it's you know potentially done the
fact is like after this is done there's a good chance you know maybe who knows what will happen
that tiaro could come on to the next podcast and maybe we could uh sort out bad blood if there is
some um and i think it's the quinton aspect really lends itself a lot yeah i can say now
quinton's in trouble with me like i've told tiaro this i was like i've offered so many
fucking times to build a bridge with quinton and he just keeps refusing and then keeps uh sniping
and he's he really uh pissed me off in this video like i've seen main sections i've already
written out my response to him for my uh the end of my tfa critique but obviously here today we'll
be able to do a full response which i'll probably link when i eventually do that series as well which
is on its way i swear so anyway that is the history we're caught right up and as you guys
know it takes us often like an hour to get through 10 minutes of content on youtube so
we're gonna try our best until we just are fucking bored i've already i already mentioned
it to mauler i ordered pizza and timed it for two hours from now so yeah or no actually it's
gonna be an hour from now that's what i before we got on i told mauler i'm gonna eat like a big ass
lunch because we're gonna be here for a while oh and of course a long long while for anyone who's
like this is stupid like this is old this blah blah like like seriously just there'll be it
there'll be an efap next week it'll be back to normal you could just give this one a skip
if it's not your thing obviously and also if it's i don't know when you ask people what's old
on the internet some people will say a week is old some people say a month is old three months
a year if it's still up and you still believe it then it doesn't matter when it came out
honestly absolutely um maybe if you go back years and years and years yeah sure but this ain't this
ain't like that um unfortunately i need to take a quick rest and take a quick quick pay go for it
wolf is anything you want to do go for it i'll read out some super chats and then we'll pretty
much just go yeah i'll just stick right here but wamen don't lie about rape ever right guys
i mean there's the thing uh there's actual proven stories about uh women who've actually
haven't they gone some of them gone to jail for um falsely accusing i believe this i read some
articles about that like that's actually happened so precedent exists i suppose of that sort of thing
yeah i can't think of any case but i you know i would expect that to happen wasn't there the
one with the rolling stone magazine that ran a story that ended up being false from a lady
claiming that i believe uh it doesn't i'm not really familiar with that story uh nice to see
the fairies abducting the skull again shame i can't catch this live more often it's all right
they'll all be uh what do you call it archived guys netflix uh netflix witcher casting thoughts
i don't even know what the casting is beyond a few things that wolf has said what are your comments
wolf uh don't like henry caval is garold uh i haven't really been paying much attention after
they're like let's just hire anyone that is not white for this character that is white and i was
like okay well i don't care about the witcher show anymore then i mean you're still probably
gonna watch it though right uh i'm i might just like i don't know i'm gonna hate it
and the um and then they had the whole thing with uh the refugee thing
the what what like refugees aren't illegal or something like that all the writers have that
picture on twitter that they posted oh i remember oh that one yeah like people aren't illegal or
some shit like that uh big fan mall keep doing you're doing fans of wolf and rags as well although
wolf does sound like he's on the verge of dying in all of his videos i am thank you uh you guys
might want to check out the jar of genesis wiki somebody added a new segment you guys find may
find interesting especially rags and wolf i wonder if it's like something to do with the video he made
i don't know i hope not i hope it's nice i hope he's nice and he i hope all as well i love every
time you guys use a drunken peasants meme thanks for the awesome streams there's a thing me and wolf
used to watch uh a lot of drunken peasants i never watched drunken peasants so any memes you get for
me will be purely coincidental it's funny because uh mauler we were talking about like uh
that we were their stream we were both watching that live but we didn't know each other then
yeah yeah it's crazy to think about there's some fucking epic moments on the drunken peasants in
the in their heyday or pry but oh yes back when they were still a thing uh this is where the fun
begins have you heard of doom cock his channel is called overlord dvd he's a fan of mauler into
sauna wolf and wants to do a podcast with the two of you i have good news i am currently in dms with
him to sort out him coming on this podcast so we uh you'll you'll be seeing him and apparently he
wants to be on his channel as well so there you go dude i looked up the jar of genesis wiki and all
i had to do was type in jared jen and it auto uh filmed in genesis wiki good let's see i want to
see what this new entry is also can't stand people like just right saying movies aren't bad if they
like them that makes every movie good then that's his logic pretty much he said that like yeah it's
it's so strange that somebody who's supposed to be analyzing what good writing is and praising good
writing is like oh yeah if it makes you feel good excuse anything's fine fuck it everything's great
it's all magical uh take my shackles now release the hide everything debate people are gonna keep
saying it uh the the there there are some people like you keep referencing it it's like it's like
mean to hide everything it's like if it's in the context we need to explain it to to explain a
question or a history hopefully after this it's just done and me and wolf won't even need to
reference it ever again yeah um but that's the thing it's like one of those things you keep in
your back pocket depending on how someone behaves i mean you know you could definitely look at it
as like a it's a safety it's like yeah it's like if some if they go out and say something that just
isn't true then you have the proof and uh i didn't know it was recorded myself but i'm absolutely
okay with it being released i don't know i don't know if there's any law we should be considered
with with it because it's a combination of three different countries at the same time so again
it's a complicated thing but again we we don't mean to bring it up to keep shitting on i hate
everything i still actually think the guy is he's a nice guy from from the conversation i had with
him he's just a little bit i don't know easy to change his mind it seems like that's the only
thing i could get from it if me and wolf was surprised by how quickly he changed his mind
i need to change it back again it's just like okay um he seemed friendly you know i'd be interested
to see the uh the argument that apparently changed his mind back that would be interesting
i can't remember what video it was but we could cover it on efap sometime if i could yeah if you
have it yeah absolutely if i check my dm history with him i should be able to find it so uh maybe
we'll set that up for next time yeah because everyone we've looked at is awful how is it the
wolf gets banned from twitter but ben shapira still has his account he pisses off way more
people daily yeah but hate speech or something wolf said hate speech he's the r-word didn't you
yeah wolf you didn't well i did oh you did oh yeah yeah that's the thing when i make tweets now
i know like don't say retard don't say certain words because they'll just yeah those things
will get picked up and then that's all it takes you lose your right to uh interact on twitter
which you know that's the way it is i suppose which is lame which is lame uh love you wolf
maulen rags and there we go are you folks ready to start this epic abortion yes i'll say as well
have you guys watched tro videos at all no so i watched a couple of them but i think i told you
like it was the first yeah the editing kind of got to the point where it was overbearing and i
it's sporadic and inconsistent because he hires different editors sometimes up to like he hires
uh well hires i don't know i don't know if he pays them i can't remember if he pays them but
there'll be like five editors on one video late labor it's i think it's like a friend deal i
think he said in one of his videos recently that he plans to basically promote them all once he's
popular and that'll be you know sort of but obviously they're not forced to it's it's their
choice and he's good friends with them all but the thing is it does make his videos a little
uh jarring bobby oh he does this is the thing about you know this is clearly a style choice
for tro but man does he talk too fast and the verbiage is a bit um how should i put this what's
the opposite of a layman um pretentious oh right he's already already throwing punches hey i know
you just asked for a word i just i was throwing the word out i don't know very well i appreciate
it i just some of his videos i've genuinely watched finished and thought you know what i've
actually learned a lot about that subject and i think that was well constructed like he did one
recently on the animation story time community thing and like i had no idea what was going on
with that and then i watched it i was like shit man that was a great breakdown but then there are
some videos where i i struggle to grasp what the point of the video was overall the first time i
ever heard of him was at the end of the i had everything video when he was like this was proof
read by this guy and i'm like so what proof read this he did oh so that's something that i mentioned
he clarified would be a wolf he didn't proof read it in that he didn't make sure the arguments
were solid he proof read it in that the made the grammar correct i believe is what he said
oh so it's like okay it's still a bit funny to have like the right opinion part i guess all right
yeah yeah yeah yeah anyway i had i have that's thing i had nothing against uh the right opinion
i just thought it was kind of funny that you got a guy named i hate our um uh the right opinion to
proof read for you i thought that was kind of like but maybe he took it personally yeah um
just two more and i'll get two super chats out of the way just in case uh they get a pile up while
we try and respond to this but you guys familiar with the lawful masses channel you just did a
video about a high schooler who is suing a group of girls who destroyed his life with false claims
of sexual assault never heard good good yeah uh if yeah good stuff shouldn't be tolerated i know
that's a partisan issue apparently well that's yeah that's the interesting thing it's like of
course that sounds like justice trying and attempting to be saved there but there are some
people who might i don't know feel frustrated at that comment so who knows we'll find out in the
comment section male is political well these are the people who say that everything is political
so i know it would probably never happen but what would an efap sardonic ass crossover look like i
don't even know that you can have a coherent podcast with six people at once one of them
are welcome to come whenever they wish to efap absolutely will i would love to have yms or
anybody come on that'd be great we'll have a gay old time yeah especially because yms was in the
chat and everything when we were going over the video by um patrick williams it was it was patrick
yeah the plot hole one i think um and yeah and any three of us would probably i imagine happily
go on on their podcast but again i can't really see a six-person podcast working yeah that's a lot
uh rags wolf's thoughts on maulers sona being a fox skeleton i've seen all the movies y'all
have famously not seen but all seen the fifth element i have no i love the fifth element
fox gallon oh that's the the fan art they're talking about i don't even know if you guys
have seen that the fox skeleton no i think that's what they're talking about actually i'm not
you gotta pick your uh pick your spirit animal but i have seen fifth element have you guys seen it
yes very good movie i have not seen it no oh man it is so good we'll watch it later
i was waiting for rags to be like how could you not see it i was like rags don't don't
that would have been strange i'm surprised but oh it'll be great you'll love it it's so good
you know i i saw a comment in the chat mauler i showed you like a bunch of the comments this
guy made on the last defap where he was like sue he really really does not like me he's convinced
i'm racist okay he's in the chat and he made a comment uh wolf makes a video in support of
the racists at charlottesville but he claims he's not a racist i think he needs a racist because
i i don't think that people it's like you go on twitter and you say i don't think that people
left to right should be oppressed for their opinions and i get called like you're not
i i just think it's funny because he he clearly did not listen to that video because i at no
point said oh yeah these racists are great guys it's like no i i don't think you watch that video
but it's just funny it's funny to see like how much he really really hates me like genuinely
all three of us you'll see it in the videos because the chat's gonna be in in all the videos
there's people who really hate either rags wolf or me singularly and they'll come to these streams
just to i'm not gonna say just to hate but just to try and leave comments where they're like that'll
sting that'll yeah so it's like it brings me joy it brings me joy oh fucking hell you know everyone
over the dab planet claims wolf is racist this is like a fight whatever it's like okay i'm just
gonna say it if you think i'm racist you're fucking retarded you don't know what racism is
it's kind of embarrassing isn't it you know how they do guilt by association you'd be like
wait wolf voted for bernie sanders does that mean racists support bernie sanders now
no it means that wolf doesn't think white people know what it's like to be poor
which is drifted into politics thanks to the chat now it's not even our fault you brought
you brought up bernie sanders that's true but it was supposed to be in defense of uh of uh wolf
oh that racist that racist yeah so anyway we're doing good for
oh by the way 35 minutes and we've not started the video
we laid the foundation for great great stuff we gotta you know we gotta start it up because
we're gonna be here all day all right all right here we go here we go
hello ladies and gentlemen welcome to the right opinion the home of a twat with too much
free time and it's been a while yes i've been busy understandably so so you got this segment
edited by koleo is cooled so that's why it'll like each section is going to be a bit different
from the next sort of thing okay this video was quite the undertaking but i wanted to give it
some sort of waste and i hope i do a while back i hate everything made a video on star wars i
won't say much more because we're going to be addressing a lot of that very soon it was one of
his more controversial releases for many reasons and ready to dispute it was a youtube by the name
of rags now that appears to be a creator who talks about a mix of media and politics particularly
with the leaning into the entertainment industry which is an interesting genre without a doubt
going on a show i like dogs and i like dildos so practically best mates at this point all joking
aside i'd only heard of rags once before the video will we speak him out today i'm a bit more out of
the loop of the political community than i let on but it was when he had a twitter account and some
artists refused to work for him because of a couple of people he was associated with although
it's perfectly reasonable to say that it's the artist prerogative of who they want to do the
work for it's still very personal and indicative of the state of the political community that we
really have that much passionate distaste for someone we'd rather not serve them because of
their friends or opinions i think uh video solid so far that sounds about right i'm glad he didn't
go the whole route of so because some people took that tweet of that i said they weren't allowed to
do art for me when i was like no i was just pointing out how fucking ridiculous it was and
petty so i'm i'm glad he got the the right opinion there we've got to criticize rags maybe
pretty harshly i would still offer him the time of day because to me content does not define the
person but and that's why the right opinion is actually a friend if you will and uh him and rags
may very well get to have a conversation someday but obviously this is the kind of thing where
my dms have always been open like tro doesn't have any connection to me or rags before making
this video so he uh you could argue that the some mistakes may not have been made had that
been the case so it's it's a it's a small reprieve but it's still gonna have to deal with what he
says as i said that was my only experience with him so i went into the video with a fairly fresh
mind on rags obviously i had my opinions on the film i thought it was okay i'm probably someone
who fell in the middle of the consensus i liked some elements and hated others i felt it was a
prospectively great film that fucked up too much impressive but frustrating so it understandably
provoked strong feelings and a lot of viewers particularly ones who fell on either side because
it definitely took risks but i don't consider it bad by any means especially considering mike in the
back huh i don't like this music in the back i am you know the idea is like a film takes risks
i've always just been like what does that even mean it's like film takes risks would it be that
would it is force awakens considered safe is that the difference like either it takes risks or it's
i guess the thing is that man yeah the force awakens is safe the last jedi i don't even
think it was risk because i think it was it's almost like saying that it took a risk was one
of those post hoc sorts of things i mean like oh it was taking risks my perspective on this whole
thing is like if it was a movie about a poop that got farted out whatever pooped out would that be
a risky film would you be able to say hey man it took risks it's like to basically guess the
point where it's like what is taking risks really matter if that's if that's what gets you into that
you know category yeah i mean i i can i can in a way i can sympathize with the sincerity of being
original yeah but i don't know a risk to me is more like um will people sit through a film
that is three scientists in in a room working on something and that's the entire film i'd be like
hmm like what do they do yeah you know what i mean it's like that does seem characters what
are they doing what's the like you could you maybe you could say that's risky because audiences
won't really respond to something like that typically like i could see that conversation
but i don't know last jedi is a risk i think that like i think that kind of bothers me about like
the whole risk argument is like they come at it whenever they bring up like oh it took risks they
always say that as though that's inherently a good thing like is it defense the film in some way
yeah it's like i don't care if it took risks if the risks it took were like shitty and led to the
movie being terrible then the risks don't mean anything that doesn't that's not a point of
endearment if you're yeah you could you can say we ruined look skywalker as a character that was
a risk we just said that was a risk that that doesn't that doesn't exactly that's not an excuse
to cushion the criticism yes oh if we because it was a risk if all we got to do is say yes it did
take risks and fine it doesn't it's not a point of quality at all for me though yeah i mean just he
took the risk of giving the last jedi over to a really inexperienced writer and filmmaker who's
made like one kind of decent movie and that's all the guys to his name don't confuse controversy
with just risk taking i mean you know jackass as a series they're all taking risks you can't
accept that even if it is like drinking whole semen is risky yeah i mean and there are risks
that were good like um uh the lord of the rings uh peter jackson was known for like
little crazy horror movies with zombies and shit and he was given the rights to make the movie to
adapt the what is one of the best books ever written and you don't find people saying you
know why lord of the rings is good because it was a risk is like no you just talk about how good it
is you don't need to say that it's a risk yeah they took a risk and he made a great movie and
we appreciate the movie because it's so great we don't appreciate it because peter jackson was the
one that got the reins yeah maybe it has to do something with somebody going into something
knowing that what they're going to do could be controversial but doing it any way yeah like
really having a clear understanding of how it will be received instead of choosing something
they know would make money they choose something that could potentially damage their own career
but so just just making um just making something original does not count as a risk
yeah it's a complicated thing i don't even consider the last jedi that risky i don't think
you can't really make as long as it just has some of the things that people can connect to
it's gonna make money because it's the sequel to force awakens it has the word star wars on it
there was a remember there was a point in time where you could put star wars on something and
people didn't go uh that was a year ago thank you solo you helped that environment so much uh
in the anime that star wars rebel show or whatever it is oh god yeah a lot of people have been very
upset with resistances oh it looks yeah it looks fucking awful yeah it's a cute show that plays at
10 p.m on sunday yeah boy such a strange uh i don't even know what you call it like the time
slots yeah anyway uh we should probably head back to tarot for the amish is it again like a
general standards of cinema in i ate everything's video as i h e testified i'd conducted a comb
through for any syntactic issues and made some amendments with the grass structure i don't touch
the points he actually makes but the content didn't jump out to me as particularly provocative
and it didn't when i watched the video either my only feedback to him at the time was that the
delivery was a bit subdued apart from the rather over the top segment at the end nonetheless i
thought it was mostly fine not my favorite but it didn't irritate me others clearly felt otherwise
rags being one of them from now i will be responding to rags points and trying to make
sense of how such points have arisen i will disagree with rags at multiple times throughout
this video as you will see soon and as i actually had no plans to respond himself i thought i'd have
a crack so without further ado let's get to it you've made a bad video rags piece of shit you
know right opinions voice should exist i'm pretty sure my fingers are falling off one of the
editors computer person claims so we all have a strong disdain for rags's voice oh um well there
we go so there shouldn't be i don't know if there should be an apostrophe yes after me uh but there
should be one oh yeah pretty sure in opinions how english works right opinions you know right
opinion apostrophe yes since you know since some tactic errors or hey man tro can't catch all of
them he's only he's only so good he opens announcing that i hate everything made a really
bad video and i'm gonna respond to it because it's a really bad video however before this he
precurses it with the fact that he doesn't watch much i hate everything at all but he does introduce
destiny too which he will not be showing any clips from but will bring the general topic up
to make a similar point a fair few times throughout this video after a few light-hearted jokes and
what i assume is the intro he gets into the idea yeah there was a reason i did that with the um
i'm pretty sure he's gonna get to it okay rags initiates by calling ihga star wars
apologist oh is that what you call yourself you call yourself a star wars fan no no no you're not
what i'd call a star wars fan i'd call you a star wars apologist now this is bathed in the sardonic
tone pertained by a lot of these commentators and look the avatar is pulling his glasses down so
it's not to be taken too seriously it's the whole video like this well this is the thing like i'm
sure is this is this going to be the whole video this is the problem i've watched the whole video
and yeah it gets it gets much worse when um what's his fucking stupid ass name um quinton is it
quinton yeah it gets much worse when he comes in so so so uh just just you know relish this moment
of somewhat sanity because he understands that an apologist is like a fan plus is like a christian
apologist is a fan of christianity it's just being more specific about the way that they carry
themselves and the arguments that they make i think yeah that's the thing we all know what an
apologist is and it's like oh you called him that without him agreeing to that label just like yeah
but he's like i don't need him to yeah but i was gonna say the reason this for me the whole video
doesn't work properly is um when i responded to h bomber guy he made a video essay in that he
structured it into segments he had evidence and he had references so i could do that back to him i
can take his references and just you know disseminate how exactly they were constructed and figure out
what parts he's left out blah blah blah what's happened here is i hit everything rambled onto
a microsoft weird document and then he put visuals to it because there's no way he spent more than
i want to say two scripts on that thing because i i hate everything admitted the video itself
doesn't really have a like you just set a flow it's it's not it's very confused it's it's him
sharing his feelings on style so then rags responds with his feelings on i hate everything's feelings
and now we've got someone who's taking an extremely analytical approach to feelings about feelings
yeah that's one of the reasons that i like doing responses to people is because it kind of comes
with a pre-built structure even if what you're responding to isn't really structured in and of
itself it's you have a base to work off of and you pretty much just respond to whatever is happening
on that other video the other video could be about 10 different random topics with no segues
no good connections but you can still do a response to it because that is still for you
the structure of what the video is you're making and it's not for the original it's not that we
can't take what rags says and uh find out if it's truly accurate in in whatever context but
you're gonna get stuff like this where he's like you have claimed that he's an apologist when in
the initial statement he said he was a fan and now so he's probably going to go on because i'm
pretty i did see the opening half an hour so but that was like half a year ago so i'm pretty sure
he goes on like does he say like what defines a fan and then what defines an apologist and it's
just like it was a bit of a throwaway comment and you've already agreed that rags is using
a form of his avatar that implies you're you're being coy almost so it's not like you're making
a declarative statement in a courtroom yeah i mean i think what he needs to understand is
that an apologist is somebody who just basically offers arguments in defense of something
i mean that's that's just what it is it's really not that much of a
i mean the word can carry baggage depending on how it's applied
but all it is is a person who offers arguments in defense of something
and that's that's it so it's really like i'm an apologist for pc gaming
i'm an apologist for liberal values is apologist is it like the actual definition of x i've never
actually looked is it like here let me look is it a negative connotations it can because um
there's like apologetics for religion and things like that a person offers an argument in defense
of something controversial yeah that's not even a bad word then like if i would count myself as
an apologist for many things yeah we're all apologists for things now apologetics is it kind
of has a negative connotation because of a lot of like christian or muslim or a lot of basically
religious apologetics because i was just going to say like um i'm an apologist for the last
jedi being awful and rags uh i hate everything it's the other side of the aisle yeah this just
seems like a strange point to get a strange start yeah however this sets the president for a
particular narrative throughout the rest of this video so to respond to this point quickly i h e
did not enjoy the prequels so to imply that he is simply in love with everything star wars feels
inaccurate after some back and forth um there i i guess that's arguably fair but i i suppose
do you need rags to clarify that he's an apologist for new star wars yeah the last
i didn't even think about like prequels when i said that the last people came out in 2005
i believe yeah i i have no idea what i hate everything feels about any other star wars film
other than the last jedi really and honestly that doesn't matter because when he was defending the
last jedi he was being an apologist for star wars if you want me to be more specific at star wars
the last jedi but whatever he's got you there rags both between he's a prime stamp where specific
rags and i g do not say anything particularly of value other than rags sarcastically and planting
the expectation that i g must have really hated the last jedi i really adore the original trilogy
warts and all oh so if you really like the original trilogy then you must have really
hated the last jedi right we get this very curious comment films like i don't know 2001 a space odyssey
and the deer hunter are excellent well-made movies but to me at least they're not the kind
of thing that i'd throw on on a cold sunday afternoon for a bit of fun light-hearted
entertainment is that what you see the last jedi is fun light-hearted entertainment that's fine if
you do there's nothing wrong with you considering it that it just strikes me as odd that you would
open this video by praising the original trilogy when one of the huge reasons that people hate the
last jedi so much is how disrespectfully it treats and tries to emulate the original trilogy when i
g is talking about the yeah i was gonna say i'm following along so far everything's fine yeah i
don't um yeah i think what i said was pretty reasonable like i don't like the music in the
background yeah the music's not only too loud but seems a little bit inappropriate but hey that's
just me yeah i mean i even say pretty blank pretty upfront that it's fine if you feel that way about
the movie tries to emulate the original trilogy when i g is talking about the old star wars movies
he threw on a sunday afternoon rak suddenly translates this to a comment about the last jedi
and cuts him with numerous yeah the the connection is if you enjoy and unlike the originals it's
it's interesting to consider that because the new ones actively contradicts a bit yeah yeah it's not
because of the prequels that we hate episode eight it's because of the originals that we hate episode
eight yeah yeah it's very strange i think that yeah i think the connections between the last jedi
and how it relates to the original should be pretty clear i know that later on certainly
he's like why'd you have to bring in the last jedi when he's talking about the originals that
seems like unnecessary it's like well i mean this this the video he's responding to is about loving
the last or defending the last jedi and he's opening with i love the originals it's like i
think it's relevant isn't it yeah it seems really relevant i don't know what his issue is actually
hey i mean i just uh just to say it uh this is the fastest we've ever gotten through four
minutes and 21 seconds i think you were right wolf the fact that he's gonna play clips for me
and rags it'll make it much easier because we can just be like yep okay this is like an immediate
response first time i may understand why someone would do that because we don't know if i h e is
going to talk about the last jedi in respect to the old movies again in the video however in this
instance i h e does and i assume rags has watched this before because he opens it up declaring it
as a bad video he states that he would be surprised if i h e would like it as fun light-hearted
so to clarify he's saying that if you'd watched the whole video you would know that i hate
everything liking the originals is like i can't remember what he just said is it relevant or not
relevant to the conversation that that should have changed whether or not you just said what you said
so i just want to catch that again what is this evidence and one of the huge reasons that people
hate the last jedi so much is how disrespectfully it treats and tries to emulate the original trilogy
when i g is talking about the old star wars movies he throw on on sunday afternoon rags
suddenly translates this to a comment about the last jedi and cuts him with numerous arguments
now when someone's doing an immediate response first time yeah yeah because this video is about
the last jedi wait he's he's he's halfway through he's about to explain why it is that you shouldn't
relate the original trilogy when i g is talking about the old star wars movies he throw on sunday
and that's the parlor i'm interested afternoon rags suddenly translates this to a comment about
the last jedi and cuts him with numerous arguments now when someone's doing an immediate response
first time i may understand why someone would do that because we don't know if i h e is going to
talk about the last jedi in respect to the old movies again in the video however in this instance
i h e does and i assume rags if i have anything does then what rags said was relevant yeah i don't
i don't see exactly i'm not following the point is yeah what's this before because he
following either opens it up declaring it as a bad video he states that he would be surprised if i h e
would like it as fun light-hearted entertainment given a lot of the fan response and then references
the audience score on rotten tomatoes and draws an inductive no he references the fact that
audiences were that's evidence the audiences did not like it more so than any other star wars film
and then the reasoning rags provided was spitting on the originals yeah you get an audience score
for 184 000 ratings and it's at a 48 that's a pretty divisive movie and like you know it's not
it's not a it's not an argument for the the film being terrible it's an argument for the film being
divisive yeah and and well you you you qualified what you said you you that's proof people didn't
like it and then you provided reasoning which was spitting on the originals which is relevant to i
hit everything saying he loves the originals and yet he loves the new one that's that's your
question for him yeah and that yeah i'm pretty much just saying it's curious all of that follows
to me this is a big sense to me yeah i'm confused exactly what the point is conclusion for why
people didn't enjoy it it just strikes me as odd that you would open this video by praising the
original trilogy when one of the huge reasons that people hate the last jedi so much is how
disrespectfully it treats the fact that you've you've covered your ass as well you said it strikes
me as odd you didn't say yeah i think that is odd and that's the thing you haven't said this is
definitively incorrect i hate everything you've literally said i find it odd yeah i mean don't
there's a feeling that you find it odd tro like wouldn't that wouldn't someone who says like i
really love terminator too also i really love terminator genesis it wouldn't even matter if
he didn't because you've you've let you've let him know with that language that this is something
you feel this is how it comes across to you yeah and what's he gonna do prove that you don't feel
it i think no i guess beats and tries to emulate the original trilogy or just straight up copy it
i'll address this point in the near future he then does the exact same thing again because at
this point i actually is talking about star wars as a premise and rags is assigning this as i h e's
opinion only last year by before he's even stated his opinion i h e refers to star wars as a general
concept not as specific movies because but he just admitted that if rags has seen the whole video
then you would be able to respond to it as such and you just established that rags has seen the
whole video therefore any statement i hate everything makes at the beginning rags can
comment in relation to the conclusion which is i hate everything likes last Jedi yeah no i can't
remember what my order was generally for videos i can't remember whether each specific video was
made after i've watched the whole thing or i've watched a certain amount and there's enough to go
by with just what i've watched generally a lot of times videos are made over a period of days and
days but i don't know i don't know i don't exactly know what his point is he then does the
exact same thing again because at this point i actually is talking about star wars as a premise
and rags is assigning this as i h e's opinion only last Jedi before he's even stated his opinion i h e
refers to star wars as a general concept not as specific movies because as stated earlier he hates
the prequel so this run of responses just seems like a waste of time and yes he does go on to say
that he likes the last Jedi but it wouldn't criticize rags for wasting time i don't think
we should be in that position yeah to a viewer who's never watched the source material they would
not understand this and because you show all the source material i assume you're trying to make
this appeal to all audiences whether they've watched the i h e video or not rags then points
out no i'm not when i make videos i don't try to appeal to a particular audience i just i just get
in front of a microphone and say stuff that i feel and then the audience comes afterwards crazy
right that you you play the whole video crazy crazy idea that is i don't i mean some people
do that and it's fine to like target a specific demographic but i don't do that no it's just the
audience that comes is the audience that comes i think it's part of the reason why me and you
get along really well as we both sort of approach it that way we like to sort of keep the entire
context and respond to it piece by piece in a way and a lot of people will be like you take the one
point that you have and respond to it that's how you make a video and it's like that's not how i
make a video yeah but i just want to clarify what he said that didn't sound right to you star wars
as a general concept not a specific movies because as stated earlier he hates the prequel so this run
of responses just seems like a waste of time and yes he does go on to say that he likes the last
Jedi but to a viewer who's never watched the source material they would not understand this
i think most people knew the lot of the i hate everything people who are watching rags's video
the majority of them are going to have seen i hate everything's video because that's why they
would have been watching it rags's audience were very aware of the star wars stuff anyway
and as you stated earlier rags has already started treating this analysis as if he knows that he likes
the last Jedi because he does know it's very strange because that's i hate everything's video
so yeah it's a bit gonna kind of both that it's it's my bad for not clarifying what the other
person's position is beforehand i guess he wants you to treat it as though we haven't discovered
whether or not i hear everything likes the film yet even though we all know that and that's part
of the reason why you wanted to respond to the video was that he took liking it into defending
it as good okay but yeah i don't know it's a bit weird because you show all the source material i
assume you're trying to make this appeal to all audiences whether they've watched the itv video
or not i mean i wouldn't even make it appeal to all audiences anyway no yeah i mean i i just want
to i just want to show everything so it's there and the link to the originals there so that i
mean it just i just respond to the whole video i just kept going i mean i think a lot of the
times when people make videos and they have people edit this and they right because i don't
this this video isn't scripted i don't script no you don't know i'm just i'm just like i just
respond to something that happens and i think a lot of the times maybe people i'm not saying this
is what tiro is doing but it's a possibility that when people do have a very structured
uh way of going about videos they assume other people do too like i like they assume that i've
watched the whole video and then i've scripted it out and then i've proofread it and then i've gone
over it again and i've looked at these points but no it's i mean all this stuff is pretty much
just off the cuff that's kind of what i was getting at like he's breaking you down very
analytically when you've i don't know i'm not sure if he's maybe he's unaware that you did this off
the cuff maybe i don't know i mean you do you do well off the cuff ragsus maybe that's a part of
your curse people will assume that you scripted it and researched it well people do um people all
the time ask me about scripting can i tell them i don't script and they're kind of shocked
but no i don't i don't really script no never for stuff like this rags then points out rightfully
ih's comment about the death threats is unsubstantiated so why is it that i'm still getting death
threats and hate coming oh fuck oh i hate it when people ever use it it's so annoying me rags and
wolf get death threats just if anybody was wondering on the internet gets death threats
everybody on the internet gets mean comments everybody on the internet who's a big name
who has a lot of who is a big audience who has opinions they get they ruffle feathers
that's just the nature of it and it has been that way since the beginning of perpetuity itself
and if you i that's that's that's he's probably going to go into it in a second but the whole
reason that i bring this up is because i'm like i hate everything you are a huge channel and you've
been on the internet for long enough to know that this is how the internet is so don't give me that
boo-hoo bullshit yeah sorry mr sarcasian but i'm not i'm not gonna hang on to your little pity
party here he's like upset that people want him to die because he likes the force awakens it's
like people get upset if you say you should die if you didn't like the force awakens what does it
matter yeah i mean jesus i mean i was just you gotta show a bit of tough skin here it's just
you're talking about a movie and obviously anonymous people on the internet are gonna say
mean things about you it's like so what being an adult jeez i'm pretty sure you you respond this
way so let's see how he responds to your response and then we'll respond to his response to your
response to i hate everything to to the movie that it'll completely make sense tell us in the
comments how you feel the force awakens yeah i remember my first week on the internet really
sorry to hear about those totally credible death threats that you got sent anita although it's
likely that you get a few when you pull that many views but that is assumed anyway and ig should
have elaborated more on this it's understood not anything exceptional but then reg refers to ig as
anita this is obviously talking about serial victim anita sakizian and this is an important
point that we shall hold on to although it just seems throw away at this moment he then attacks
ig as pulling the boohoo woe is me card i was gonna throw my hat into the ravenous never-ending
black hole that his opinions on the last jedi long before this but for too long i just felt too beat
down and disappointed to say i'm sorry i can't listen to that not go oh yeah that's that's him
going boo hoo absolutely it is ih he's going um i'm not even sure what the purpose of him saying
it is i guess he's just trying to explain why he was so late to the party yeah but that absolutely
he is absolutely he is say anything gosh we're pulling the boo hoo woe is me card pretty quick
don't you think especially for a channel called i hate everything when really i just felt that
ih was expressing his own problems and why he hadn't reviewed it sooner if that's how he felt
that's how he felt he's not asking for your sympathy not everyone said we're not asking for
your approval of our feelings on his feelings yeah sorry but you can't play that card for i
hit everything and not rags that's that's another problem with this video it works both ways it
works both ways rags gets to say what he thinks about that yeah and when you're ihe and you say
some of you are gonna love me and some of you are gonna hate me it's like fuck off grow up
i know it's like come on get on with it it's just like yes yeah you can literally say that
water is a drink and there's gonna be someone out there like that's fucking stupid no it's
a fluid it takes the shape of exactly it's just like yeah you can't this and star wars of course
is going to be maybe a more corrosive subject because of the fact that it's a huge fan base
with completely shifting ideas all the time but again this doesn't not happen in star trek or
fucking lord of the rings especially with the new series it's going to come out um
i'm just i was going to say like this pretty much applies to just every franchise
that's big yeah it's just inevitable people people fight over this stuff because that's what
happens this is the thing is like i it's i don't know much about ihe's content but the feeling
that i get from it is that he doesn't often he spends a lot of time going after easy targets
so when he goes after something that's really divisive
like he's really bracing himself or something some people might think you're being unfair to
say that but like room that's the impression i get he he's he went after big mouth which is
typically looked at as terrible he went after love island which is one of the like most
shitty tv shows that are like reality tv shows in britain i was even surprised he took that on
then he got um the destiny two the destiny destiny two thing destiny two was getting
shat on significantly well even the first one was getting a huge amount of flack i mean they
both were i mean those were pretty easy targets to make and then i mean and this is without looking
at his channel this video thinking that i wouldn't get a lot of flack for it of course i knew i would
oh i know he's made a video on um what's that depression show um oh
13 reasons why yeah yeah and that's generally by most people looked at as a good show
it's not a good show and he goes through all the reasons why it's a shit show
i think he has 13 reasons why doesn't he it's like the way that i ate everything went into
this video and the stuff that he said in the way that he said it absolutely gave me the impression
that he was trying to temper what would all what he already knew was coming and that he almost was
ready he almost had a foot out of the door already like it's just my opinion and that means
don't you don't some of you're gonna hate me is like i um i was gonna say evil Loch Ness it's like
my favorite uh commenter he's he's like the heckler of he called you racist a bit ago rags but uh
he just came in with we take 30 minutes to talk about five minutes of video and yet we say get
on with it people yes um i i guess i should explain we're doing a podcast and uh this is a
video from someone who is scripted and it's an analysis we're doing a podcast video
pre-scripted and and we're the pot we talk about stuff as friends right it's a different
it's a little bit different but i can understand the confusion is okay but it's in bed i'm not a
racist but i do need to pull this water bottle so i need to defend my non-racistness well i like
laughed randomly earlier and it was because i just read a quote where he was like i don't watch i
haven't seen this video because of rags as a racist i was just like what okay it's such a
friend and it's like you know i get it from rags and wolf all the time um it still happens for me
because i criticize black panther but it's just so it's so indicative of the internet like yeah i
mean come on we're we're friends with fringy he's green yeah that is true and we talked to
apobend apobend promised us that things would be different after he came on yeah he gave us his
brown seal of approval exactly his own problems and why he hadn't reviewed it sooner if that's
how he felt that's how he felt he's not asking for your sympathy not everyone's saying that
they've been feeling down it's immediately doing that especially when it's embedded within reasonable
context and the context in this is why he hasn't made a video sooner it is a youtube who wears his
heart and asleep it's not unusual of him to admit that he's emotionally vulnerable i don't think
anything rags says contradicts what you just said rags is simply saying the pointing it out
this is hang on a second he's not it's not like i hate everything said i've been anxious about
this and i've got personal things to deal with and that's why i couldn't release the video he
literally said that like oh it's just so i mean we could go back to the clip but i'm pretty sure
he basically goes over how star wars is an environment where this it's just like you don't
want to get into that sort of thing like it's just like oh man i i was gonna do it but man that is a
that is a toxic environment and this is a little bit of inference that rags wouldn't even be able
to have reference for because rags has admitted that he doesn't actually watch i had everything's
channel he's responding to this video so to be like you see he's made a video on anxiety so you
should realize that he's talking in reference to that it's like well then he probably should have
mentioned that like if i had everything said i suffer from anxiety and that's been pulling me
away from being able to make this video because i don't want to deal with what comes next would be
like that would be and the thing is i made a video that kind of had the that had a similar
similar tone to a boogie and uh it's unlisted right now yeah didn't you uh for special reasons
didn't you stream with boogie and like yeah it was actually on the the scroll bar at the
beginning of the the video when he was going through my videos but yeah i did uh but yeah
i had a really good stream with him and talks to him and i like to think that we're on good terms
uh but yeah uh there's a way to go about that and i mean i stand by what i said in that video
at the time especially but it's unlisted right now for some special reasons but there's a way
to go about that uh i hate everything is his word it's horrible he's done this before in his
depression video for example my body literally cannot take it anymore and i feel that making
a video essay explaining how anxiety affects me will not only help why you rags there's no
reference for this and it's not referenced in the actual video this is i i was like i'm not gonna
give i'm not gonna listen whenever i respond to somebody i'm not going to go into their
psychological issues or their anxiety issues i'm not going to give them a physical
if they say things then i don't if they say a thing in a video i don't care what their
physical ailment is i will respond to the thing that they said in their video yeah and i'm not
even sure what are you trying to say here it's like you see he suffers from anxiety that means
talking about how he doesn't want to get involved with star wars makes sense and it's like well
that could be anything that proves my point it's just for a reason i wasn't aware of but it still
means i'm right yeah i don't i don't i'm just not following this and again like no reference as you
already know rags does not know about this so why even bring it up me cope and deal with it but
it may even help other people out there come to terms or relate or empathize on just what it can
do to a person now we begin a section that i probably disliked the most out of rags's video
i think the reaction and response to the last jedi is quite frankly embarrassing i think the
reaction and the response to destiny 2 is quite oh this is like one of my favorite bits from your
video oh really i thought this was like the most the watertight part that i've got yeah obviously
implying that i hate everything's reaction to destiny 2 is precisely i hate everything's
problem with people reacting to the last jedi um other than the death threat stuff but even then
there's going to be people in the in the destiny 2 community that have been throwing death threats
the fucking devs because people are crazy and that's something that happens frankly rather
embarrassing there are a lot of people who should be ashamed for the things they've said because of
a star wars movie there's a lot of people who should be ashamed for the things they said about
a video game what kind of world are we living in where it's normal for people to send a direct to
hate messages because they didn't like the movie they made this our world this is what happens all
the time we live in yeah i don't know why this is just discovered the internet yeah that's the
thing is like i know this i don't remember my first week on the internet but i mean come on man
you're just gonna especially someone as big as i hate everything is like that's how that's how
random people on the internet are that's how that's how the internet is then there's nothing you can
do to change that yeah like even the most like innocent and smooth movies that have like nothing
controversial happening in it people will be like fuck you for making that just be like okay
fine really is this your first week on the internet you know this happens for basically
everything that has a fan base right i think it's strange that you've attached yourself to star wars
in this way that you treat it like it's some sort of a special example when really these kinds of
things are everyday commonplace trivialities he makes this nout of equivalence towards iit's
response to destiny during iit's report on how he viewed the last jedi response not only is this
accompanied by no clips whatsoever from the destiny video you can need
clips and besides it's a response to i it everything i it everything knows what's in
that video yeah he knows what he made and like i do understand that it could benefit with clips
you could like have direct oh yeah i could be more i could you could always be more specific
but yeah but like yeah it's there it's the it's more in concept if anything else the fact that
i mean look at the fucking title i hate at destiny 2 i know that that's a part of his channel
memes but he really does rip into that game and yeah i mean i love this this i hate destiny
2 video was really good even this new destiny 2 video was good yeah it's like i really like that
video that's why his the last jedi video just was like a shocker to me because i'm like this is
are you the same person and yeah and i believe it's a slam dunk when he says that um it's so
interesting that people are so you know angry and evil about a show a a fiction that is about
finding the light or whatever it's like how is this not the same as destiny exactly that's the
whole point that i brought up yeah so i look forward to him responding to that bit yeah video
but just an image of this video within a large description if you watched it's video on destiny
which rags claims at the end of the video he has you'll know that in spite of his criticisms he's
perfectly respectful right he's perfectly respectful that's subjective you can say it's
incredibly disrespectful if he ever says anything about the design if you for example if he says
that um the story makes no fucking sense there's a guy who wrote that so you've clearly disrespected
him yeah you just said his story was nonsensical and to clarify i'm not saying you shouldn't ever
disrespect somebody because ultimately ryan johnson disrespected the ot so of course i could
disrespect him but um to imply that i hate everything is nothing but respectful to bungee
in his analysis of yes destiny too that's ridiculous and he sure as hell's like respectful
to star a lot of people appeal in like star wars in this movie rags assumes that i h g is talking
about any negative response rather than the brand of negative response that oh yeah right rags is
obviously misunderstood i hate everything i hate everything was only referring to psychopaths
saying that you need to die if you made the last jedi it's like come on man why even make that video
at that point why would why would i hate everything say you know anybody who's saying they're going to
kill people over a film that they're not good people i hate everything is lumping far more
than just people who are saying the film isn't uh the film isn't good they full kill yeah that's
why i said that this that i hate i hate everything's video basically he's talking to people like me
and mauler and wolf he's talking about us he's not just talking about um he's he separates them
but he talks about both he talks about the crazy ones he talks about pretty much everybody if you
didn't like this film it's because xyz and we'll get into those reasons later i assume but yeah
the i felt like one of the reasons i i wanted to do a response to this video is because he was
talking to people like me and i think that fundamentally all rags is doing is mirroring
i hate everything's argument onto uh i think he's not necessarily i don't think rags is outwardly
claiming that i hate everything is 100 hypocritical here it's it's almost just like think about this
think about the fact that i had everything saying all of this despite the fact that he did this
and when we brought that to um uh just right if you remember in the in the debate he was like yeah
you know i kind of regret that now you know like making videos that are negative and uh if you
remember in i hate everything's video here towards the end he says that he's sad that he's
contributed to negative criticism okay and so do you understand how that proves rags right
i hate everything saying i'm a part of the problem rags references a video from i hate everything
do you get it the the connection there i hate everything himself is admitting
that he is part of the people he's criticizing in this video yeah i don't i really don't get i
thought this was like one of those really kind of obvious things but i guess maybe i'll try to
specify more because there are people like the right opinion who don't get it well i mean this
is the problem of this shit man because it'll go from i hate everything saying you didn't quite get
what he was saying to uh you saying tiaro didn't quite get what you were saying to tiaro get is
saying that we didn't quite get what he was saying you know and then we might respond to him no you
didn't get what we were saying it's just like being explicit is helpful i suppose immediately
after and this is what confuses me because i h e qualifies these two statements in the sentence
with the third completing his narrative tripling by state yeah oh it's also interesting that he
plays this clip as he's saying that because the clip that he's talking about in the lore in the
wiki and the grim wars right is the exact same defense of destiny two's lore and the lack thereof
as is given for a lot of the problems with the last jedi well in these books well it's explained
elsewhere yeah or in this wiki it's it's like why you're proving my point also do you hear him say
that i hate everything completes his narrative tripling it's like tiaro knows that he's learned
about this in whatever course and he's like there's no way there's no way a layman would
understand what i just said but it doesn't matter because it sounds intelligent and again i'm
friends with tiaro but i would say this to his face why the fuck did you just say
that i hate everything completed a narrative tripling what the fuck does that even mean
wait let's say narrative well let it let me play it again so you just you get it for definitely
respectful rags assumes that i h e is talking about any negative response rather than the
brand of negative response that i h e is referring to which is clarified immediately after and this
is what confuses me because i h e qualifies these two statements in the sentence with the third
completing his narrative tripling by stating that what's a narrative tripling so uh
i i i'm i've googled narrative tripling and i i'm getting like rule of threes
um it's but i i'm almost certain there's this precedent for it because oh yeah um he's like
complete a course in literature or something and i'm certain that's where it comes from
but the fact it's not on the first um well youtube is a platform for for everyone so
like why would you use language that like 90 of the audience is going to be like what
i'm i'm gonna i'm on page three and narrative tripling hasn't popped up yet um but the i mean
maybe he's talking maybe that's like an allusion to uh the rule of threes uh that's right that's
suggest that things that come in threes are inherently funnier more satisfying or more
effective than other numbers or things i doubt he's going to qualify at the listing
response that i h e is referring to which is clarified immediately after and this is what
confuses me because i h e qualifies these two statements in the sentence with the third
completing his narrative tripling by stating that these people are the sorts of individuals that
send the direct to hate messages not anything that would be endorsed by the destiny of you
now although rags his point about anything with a fan base being subject to hate messages is true
on principle there's still definitely been an exceptional vitriol to do with the last jedi
it's literally tied to just how many people are in the fan base and you can extrapolate that into
how many hate messages there'll be yeah like especially when the creators of the last jedi
have been so vitriolic in response like the predator fan base was vitriolic about the new
film but they're so small by comparison to star wars that you really would have heard about it
yes that's just how it works let me get my fridge here it's being loud
the many fans can empathize with when i h e expresses this although i h e should have
worded his point better at this moment to emphasize the magnitude of the response over
the existence i don't think there's much debate over the point that those involved with the last
jedi have probably received significantly more hatred than most films with a fan base
i don't think star wars is it has a huge audience you didn't disagree with that though
you didn't say that star wars isn't getting slightly more or uh let's just say in ratio
more you're saying everyone gets it so why are we bringing it up and it's like because
star wars gets more and you're like okay and it's explained dramatically by compare star
wars fan base to literally every other fan base it's like you'll find something interesting out
it's it's very interesting like this is a point of contention like he invents the idea i just i
don't know you see and i think people understood the brand of individuals he was referring to here
now in light of this rags follows this by making a similar point grow up you pathetic children i
just think it's kind of sad that such rampant negativity can be spawned from a franchise
that is all about never allowing the darkness to win holding onto hope at all costs i mean that is
so cringe worthy to listen to how did he make that point like what are you doing i hate everything
point that those involved with the last jedi have probably received significantly more hatred
than most films with a fan base and i think people understood the brand of individuals he
was referring to here now in light of this rags follows this by making a similar point
children i just think it's kind of sad that such rampant negativity can be spawned from a franchise
that is all about never allowing the darkness to win and holding onto it's sad the negativity
comes from a story about never letting the darkness win what nonsense is that in the in
the thing that makes it so good we'll let it play just a little further kazoo hope at all costs i
mean look i just think it's kind of sad that such rampant negativity can be spawned from a series
that's supposed to be about protecting the light and holding onto hope at all costs you see what
i'm doing here i know very simple yeah that's a good that's a good not only that and not only
that it's doubly good because the the space magic that you use in destiny 2 is called the light
and the bad guy or like the ultimate badness in the destiny 2 game is called the darkness
and his video is called i hate destiny 2 i'm done like is anybody gonna just just that's a
bit negative would you say would you say that yeah it seems a bit negative the video was good
because it was very negative absolutely it had a lot of criticisms about it but i was like how
could you be the point how could you be negative about destiny 2 when it should be when it's about
holding on to the light and fighting against the darkness at all costs how could you how could you
hate destiny 2 uh although ih's point was definitely overly sentimental there's no crossover
between that and his video there is absolutely crossover you're so fucking wrong it is absolutely
a direct parallel between the two well you're flat out wrong on this they're the exact same
thing he said it was overly sentimental like as well that's not even a defense it's like if i
make a statement that's just wrong and then i go yeah but it was sentimental it was prompted by
my feelings i don't know if he's defending it saying it's sentimental it's it's almost like
tiro's rolling his eyes a little at how sentimental it said but it's just wrong it's just wrong
it doesn't it's silly it's a silly statement and you need it to sort of slip past because it's just
like wait what did you just say the exact same thing applies to both of them equally and that's
the funny thing destiny 2 is a brilliant example because it's pretty much the same thing but like
take any fiction and you could probably skew it you'd be like lord of the rings to be negative
about a story that's all about trying to prevent the darkness from taking over persevering and
holding on to hope and doing what's right in the face of immense you know difficulty how could you
be negative about a story like that and the unbelievable irony that you're hearing this from
i hate everything it's like what what what this is oh man oof if this is his biggest problem with
my video and this is like the strongest most concrete salient point that i'm making oof
that's rough i expect honestly i've expected better well it's gonna we know it gets worse once
quinton comes in destiny 2 and even if rags his points about destiny 2 were as a general critique
of fan response i h e would not endorse that mentality either even though i would argue that
fan response to the last jet i have of course but he's propagated that same behavior he's condemning
yeah that's the whole thing he even admits it at the end of the video
and that's precisely what rags is pointing out he's a hypocrite has been significantly more
volatile than that to be a stormtrooper hey man that is a stretchy stretchy hoodie it's an
interact to destiny 2 yeah i thought it sucked and i want everyone involved to die horribly he
then tries to deconstruct i h e's title on destiny what do you mean you're done with destiny 2
whatever happened to holding on to hope at all costs whatever happened to protecting the life
which i assume is mental i haven't heard that in a while i haven't watched my video since i made it
it's so why can't you hold on to hope why do you have to say you're done
rags is deconstructing the title it's like i'm just reading the words i'm done and taking them
literally it's like this is what i mean it's like do we need to actually put out there the saying i
hate everything i hate destiny 2 i've done that these things are negative or are we supposed to
take that as sentimentality to be humorous because of all the equivalences that aren't taken into
account the difference in fan base difference in response to difference in his matter yeah this is
the thing rags could be saying that too i hate everything all rags is done this is the thing rags
doesn't actually agree that you should not hate on things if they're about positivity he's saying
i hate everything doesn't make any sense making this comment that's it yes the the idea that you
should like things because you should hold on to the idea that you should hold on to light at all
costs and everything like that and be you know to have perseverance with you know your positivity
i guess is what he's saying yeah like you can apply that to anything like this is not amazing
to me how this flies right over his head and he doesn't see that these are the he rags is making
the same exact analogy just changing titles to clarify if the new lord of the rings tv show
comes out and then wolf and me watch episode one and then wolf's like man that was shit and then i
go well i you know do you need to do that this this is a fiction about the positives of life yeah
if you don't like it the orcs win like wolf and rags would be like more what the fuck are you
talking about i'd be like oh shit yeah that doesn't make any sense considering my entire history
if somebody said that the predator was a great movie because you have to hold on to autism at
all costs that's not a that's not a defense that is pure emotion that has nothing to do
with the film itself get out of here with that that is that's like a mean answer
something that people say ironically but he said it unironically here which was sad
taken into account the difference in fan base difference in response the difference in history
the difference in narrative ensued by the products there is a unique sentimentality about
the old star wars films in particular around hope and such they've not been portrayed in the death
and games and what what now he's making the point he's making the same fucking point
what are you saying destiny unlike star wars isn't really about hope as much from me i shouldn't
have made this same mistake that i hate everything did you should have learned something by my video
gotta gotta see that again the products there is a unique sentimentality about the old star wars
films in particular around hope and such they've not been portrayed in the destiny games and once
again he's not what are you talking that's insane about have you ever played destiny of course that's
the thing i haven't played it but i know that destiny has strong themes about like overcoming
this the stress and the the spread of humanity to remain hopeful like what are you talking about
destiny's got a big audience and it's the second game the game has a history
it has the theme of hope oh my god oh you dropped the ball just like i h e did i expect better
i don't even understand he's like this is you should be making this point because i had
everything's clearly talking about blah blah blah but anyway also he's right you're like
what no he's not yes we're not the last show as a film right now he's talking about what he
perceives as the rancor within the tone of certain and we're commenting on it being completely
hypocritical we understand what he's saying it was very simple you shouldn't be so negative
about something that's all about being anti-negative which isn't even true by the way
like star wars is the constant fight between uh you know good and bad good people refraining
from doing bad things you can't have one without the other if everything was good then nothing
would be good would it it's like if i was going to make a video on why something was bad or why
something was good i wouldn't scour the internet to find the the post with no upvotes or two
upvotes after two hours and that that are self-censored and ridiculous and try to prop those
up as examples of things it's ridiculous you would you shouldn't be so negative about a movie as
incredible as the room for how happy it makes everyone when they watch it really it's about
family because i'm within the response to it in a minute response alone hey i mean we can't
have consistency i mean star wars is oh and look rags makes his point very clear it's all about how
i hate everything is inconsistent that's it it doesn't need to go any further than that
but there we are special brand you could say it about destiny but you you can't say it about star
wars it's totally different guys and once again i do not think that it is excusing the brand but
there has been a response to the last jedi and yeah he's just doubled down on the same point
the the last jedi gets more hate which i would happily agree with but i don't think should it
be said that 100 hate messages is more important to discuss than your average 90 hate messages
i don't know it just i don't even think about things like that it's just one of those
it's irrelevant to us in terms of thinkers but even a content creator with 100 subscribers will
get a death threat more than likely yeah absolutely i'm i'm sure and it's one of those things like
why are we even really talking about all i was doing was pointing out he there's a there's
apparently this is either this is in his blind spot or he's not he's not being i even say it
he's not being consistent he's not being consistent between well but i hate everything isn't being
consistent between what he said about the last jedi and hey his defense of the last jedi
specifically with the point of holding on to hope at all costs right and there are reasonable
responses too no one's saying that they don't exist it's just as i h g implied earlier the
vocal minority it seems a lot more vocal this time round yeah but by talking about the vocal
minority you give them a voice not only that but there's a vocal that's how they are vocal because
a guy with 1.6 million subs clips him and puts him on the front of his youtube video that's how
they become vocal because they get broadcasted out like that it's it's so and to me i'm just
like are you really going to die on this hill that it should be talked about with the last jedi
because it's it's more so than the average thing when i don't even think that's necessarily true
like what was the look at ghostbusters 2016 i believe that was uh i believe pulphy got more
hate than ryan johnson probably did like genuinely because it was political or more so political
than it was uh just about ruining franchise i think there was there was less defense of
ghostbusters yeah pizza so two hours already there's no way there's an hour and a half
oh they were early yeah but they're there yeah when it comes to ghostbusters there there were
way less defenders for ghostbusters to the point where i don't remember seeing any review of it
that was in defense i'm sure they know for a fact if i had everything in code that film he would
have shown it yeah but i would have just asked why aren't you holding on to hope at all costs
the theme is about defeating otherworldly evil saving what you love why are you being so negative
and giving into that see that's the thing it could be about any movie but then but unfortunately i
need to use the loo again go for it because i'm just like fucking like a turnstile of water yes
i'll read out some super chats hate will only make them stronger so true yo guys i'd like to
recommend an animator rags and wolf called gundam iron blooded orphans the full series sub and dub
free on youtube by the studio who owns it the channel is gundam info i will keep i'll copy the
name and i will put it in my in my notes for this video i will drop it right there so i can
let them know probably once we finish the stream or whatever see about it um originally probably
been completely copied ending from escape from la oh i did see that yeah uh king slayer dynamically
i saw the video comparing it was quite interesting so glad i made it to a stream love you guys
appreciate it man uh will rags make e-cumsicles once he's done e-fapping you know there's no real
specific rule on that so i can't say it's a yes or a no uh not releasing i hate everything debate
is a crime against humanity i mean hopefully we can just i want to set up a conversation with
him live just just that it'll be nice you know that that would work woof woof uh and thus
everything is cyclical and it never ends i just wanted to say thanks more for speaking a clear
analytical manner about art and articulating what it means makes a good script i've learned
to appreciate good movies much more thank you uh that genuinely is very encouraging to hear from
anybody um you get a lot of the reverse stuff which we'll actually get to this video where
i'm a blight on film criticism rather than helping uh i think we have four levels deep
in commentary here are there anything to rags to tro to us there's some inception level shit how
much deeper could we go maybe tro will respond to this video who knows it'll be difficult considering
it's probably gonna be like 10 hours long but hey uh rags is only a canine supremacist
and just looked up half sheeb half corgi it's so cute absolutely uh thank you all for the donations
um i'm is either of you here right now i got my pizza i'm happy now well scott is pizza rags is
peeing we're 10 minutes and 48 seconds in i think we've done pretty well so far considering our uh
track record yep just another hour and 46 minutes left which means another 10 hours of stream
this doesn't let's take it all bets is that will we finish the video it's like hmm
um we might not finish the video we'll definitely get to uh you know fuck face but
i wouldn't call mauler a blight on cinema just a bigoted right winger okay um mauler can't even
get into narrative tripleting you ever heard of that shit wolf i've never heard of that term in
my life it's like to just to me i just wonder if he's just a little bit out of touch writing
that down you must be like how many people do you think you're going to understand what you're
saying when you say that uh yeah i can't even imagine anyone actually understanding that
narrative tripling that doesn't even make sense at all it's very confusing to me
also my hand is better by the way i injured it and it feels like i need like two days before i can
get on with some strong editing again i need to do a patreon post today i should have done that
before the stream because now i'm going to be over midnight but i will do it after the stream to give
updates on uh the good old tfa critique that's still coming along level you guys's work as star
wars fans i wanted to recommend the kotor aperion project for you guys to check out fair enough oh
yeah another thing that was recommended if you're both here was uh gundam iron-blooded orphans on
youtube someone sent in a super chat saying they would like uh they think you should check it out
basically both of you iron-blooded orphans i believe that's what it was iron-blooded orphans
i think we need an orphan holocaust personally what are you killmonger who was correct i'm told
who was correct he's gonna throw that in uh anyway let's continue harry's it's points saying
that he doesn't care if you liked or disliked the vast july by saying that this whole video is him
whinging at people who disliked it wait you understand this video is you whinging right
that's what this video is it's never pretty much and then saying that this wasn't even his biggest
problem it was more his tone and that he should have covered the last show as a film rather than
what he viewed as the irrelevant shit we've pretty much gone over we used that word already
we've gone over why it's irrelevant it fucking happens all over the place it'd be like me
complaining about oh man i opened the door today and i got a gust of wind what's that about it's
like doesn't that usually happen whatever you go outside no okay no it's particularly windy today
and you're like oh okay so anyway get on with your point question buck what's the point yeah
fair though that's not even really my big contention with i hate everything's video
about the last jedi is that it takes the absolute worst possible way to defend something and it
makes them come across as a huge hypocrite maybe if you spent more time and effort actually defending
the film in your video instead of lashing out against people because they had criticisms of it
ignoring the big glaring problems that yeah which by the way for the record me and wolf didn't
really believe when i hear everything was like i've never heard these arguments before it was like
there's no way every video i don't believe it the shit's on the film most if most if not all
cover holdo being retarded like that's that's one of the most typical complaints yeah the day after
i went and saw this with my father i it was late so i slept and then i got up i started watching
people's videos of it like the next day i was like yeah that's yeah okay yeah that's a problem
that's a problem and then the list just kept going as people thought more and more about it
the idea that you had all the time to make this video to edit it all together that you watched it
as he said like three times he watched it and you never heard of a criticism against it like
come on dude i don't believe you yeah and this and this thing he he went back to saying it after
speaking to me and wolf was just like oh so you just ignore them then like that's pretty much
the way you do this okay yeah and that makes me think so little of ihe when you can sit down with
him for that long and tell him all the problems and he can agree the movie's bad and then
completely flip and say he's never heard any good arguments against it well it makes you wonder
doesn't there's a lot of respect for him especially since you know me and mauler were the ones that
were talking to him for five fucking hours i'm telling ihe that was really a scummy thing he
did man that's something i doubt i doubt you'll ever see this but fair enough i that was oh
people did have with the film and instead spotlighting the tiny irrelevant shit that
no one cares about this is something that confuses me rags takes issue with the fact that i hate
everything has not made this star wars video how rags would like him to make it i don't think
no okay so let me clarify what was not even close to correct what was the name of i everything's
video on the last jedi by the way um is it literally just star wars the last jedi dash ihe okay
um yeah correct me well you know you go first rags because this is he's criticizing you
yeah that's that's just that's just not what i'm saying if that's what you took from it man
oh i don't know i think i'm pretty clear about you know the the way that i criticize what he's
saying because i never i never say you should have done this so much as i'm saying it's interesting
that in your defense of this film which he actually gets into later you spend so much time
on what pretty much any normal everyday internet user in these spheres would be like yeah that
doesn't this is pointless why are you doing this yeah like i would actually have the same
reaction to literally any fucking subject if it opened with you know this is getting
a lot of hate from people who're saying you should just go die and that's bad it's like yeah okay
yeah okay and you you see it as a preamble you're like so you're gonna make a point right
because like this is just so standard at this point and that's why it's so strange coming from
i hate everything much like he's he's been on the internet longer than me rags and wolf i think
probably yeah at least making videos longer than all of us so it's just like how do you not know
about this is essentially him criticizing i h e from an idealistic standpoint he made a video
more focused on bad fan response than the other video focus is no no i wouldn't at all say that
i h e's video was focused also ideological differences i don't think i don't even know
what i h e's ideology is i i know i let me go say i have no idea what i h e's political leanings are
as i say this if i knew in the past then i have forgotten between then in the moment that i'm
saying this i have no idea if he is more liberal or conservative i have no idea what party he
supports or who he voted for i have no idea as i say this and if i knew in the past i have forgotten
i have no idea what his ideology is i you know for me my political ideology is uh if you put pineapple
on pizza i don't believe you deserve to live that's pretty solid i thought you were gonna say
i don't believe you're real i don't know that's how far you go with it well you know i know they're
real i don't want to accept it but i know it but at least we have the option of gas chambers for
those people so you know there we go i'm just waiting for the the response where they're like
wolf said that and he sounded like he may have been sarcastic but i'm pretty sure he was threatening
to kill a very large portion of humanity yeah he's racist press p for uh pineapple for pineapple
gas chambers genocide yeah pineapple genocide press p for it everyone probably specifics more
well that's i h e's prerogative he can talk about what he bloody well wants to yeah and rags can
talk about what he bloody well wants to yeah yeah asshole i can talk about whatever i want to you're
not entitled to me making the video that you wanted to make yeah how'd you like them fucking
you may be i had everything's british friend but rags has one of those too and i can say bloody
well too yeah it's not hard never did i ever say that he had to make the video that i wanted him to
make yeah and it's like it's almost like you're policing rags and saying rags should be uh making
a specific video according to you yeah why why are you criticizing my video why are i should
why do you feel entitled to a video that you wanted why can't you let me make the content i
want i want yeah yeah very very unclear point there i would just go as far as saying i think
what he was going for was he took a quote that doesn't exist rags saying i had everything you
should say what i wish for you to say and then he was like that's not how it works rags like but
that's not what happened so sorry he's just going off what he has seen and experienced rags slots
in this painting criticisms with broad strokes point painting with far too broad a stroke people
who didn't like something that you like for no other reason than it and that will be it was true
when i said it in the video and it will become even more true as the video plays on yeah you
he's provided no substantiation onto anywhere in this video where i h e paints people with such
in fact well why haven't you uh have you watched the whole video yes your criticism yeah i believe
one of your your comments was about whether or not i had watched the whole video and uh clearly
at this point you haven't watched my entire video because it is explicitly elaborated upon later
very strange i i sense a little projection very unusual it attempts to separate these
comments throughout the video at this point it just seems like an attempt to position himself
where he can make it look like an unpleasant person almost how could rags not say the exact
same about you yeah like a total substantiating evidence so he can rain down the rags hellfire
he probably goes out with the other less tolerant people i assume he criticizes on his channel he
then equivocates backlash with criticism perfectly within your right to feel however you want but
do you not think that the backlash is kind of clashes hang on yeah let me just check because
i'm curious what does backlash actually mean a strong negative reaction by a large number of
people especially social or political strong negative reaction what i made in my video could
absolutely be considered backlash yeah the backlash against last jedi is absolutely people
being critical without a doubt rags did read into that that's what that word means it's not like you
just wow did you see what i mean like tro is supposed to be to the core analytical and it's
just like i didn't even confirm before i looked up the word because i was like from what i know
backlash is just literally negative response but i could be wrong and it's like nope it means a
strong negative reaction that's it's right there wow like this is like is this it and it gets worse
from here god yeah man massively over exaggerated and unnecessary massively over exaggerated and
unnecessary it's like do you think that's what i hate everything is describing death threats as
he's of course look what he's he's he's dead to rights look at these look at these screenshots
you got um so deeply disappointed right now i clearly wanted to love i can't ideally screen
oh wait i'll let it play for a bit uh no oh wait hang on yeah go go because it it kind of passed
down a different thing that the backlash is kind of massively over exaggerated and unnecessary
when when saying backlash he shows a comment that says so deeply disappointed right now
i dearly wanted to love this movie i remember emerging from the theater stunned saddened the
reasons are so well documented by many here i never imagined signing up to rotten tomatoes but
such was my disappointment at this film i felt compelled to have my little rant backlash that
so sorry tro but that person is precisely who rags is trying to defend by saying that you're
doing a broad stroke yeah especially with what i he says later on i mean this is whoever mike a
is he'd said nothing unreasonable i believe it's in my ds2 response video but i say like it's like
the first rule of youtube where whenever you're looking at like an analytical video they will
often prove themselves wrong in in their actual like you know like tro is like he's not saying
that about them and then plays a clip that proves himself wrong and it's just like okay it's strange
it's like people don't pay enough attention to the background footage and you you can leave with
that with an avatar maybe they should do the same thing i've pointed out in the past this happening
before like there was a there was a guy who said that i was like racist and stuff and so he he
played a bun he he had a bunch of tweets of mine in the background that show how egalitarian i am
and it's just one of those strange sort of you're saying one thing but what you're showing
defeats your point in my case the russian ball existing well look paul a is obviously
much more reasonable than mike a i can't even see his comment can you see it no i just see paul a
i don't i only yeah i just know it cuts okay it cuts but both of them are russian bots we know
that oh yeah the last jedi was garbage as are we every ounce of i am clearly abrasion and once
again that's just rather nonsensical now backlash includes much more broader fields than just
chris's whoa you can't just fling the definition across the screen like that no one can fucking
read that what's the point it's like you have to time that and you have to clip it or is that
your video magic to make it no aspect and then you have to get the time right i know what it
takes to make a thing slide across the screen like that why bother if nobody can read it
that i h e has emotionally attached himself i i can't i can't remember where i come if i don't
know if i skipped over too much or something there hang on this point with a point about
mischaracterization no i've gone too far i could have sworn it was something 55 so i'm assuming it
was 14 55 which either makes a joke believed or not through a boy no i guess i'm too far ahead again
aggressive would say but i h e is no regressive and he would oh god regressive how does that come
into it we have to go further was brad did it not occur to you that maybe it would be far more must
be 13 55 i guess says that if people went into this movie expecting to hate it then oh 12 55
someone just said okay my bad just rather nonsensical now backlash includes not here really
i'm by the way i'm going to try and pause on that definition broader field
oh yeah so this is the definition i read off
and it counted tro so i'm interested to see what he's going to say about this
just rather nonsensical now backlash includes much more broader fields than just criticism
then there's the use of the always exactly oh okay so his argument is rags it's not just about
people criticizing the film i hate everything's involving people who are doing death threats
well rags his whole point was it's not just people who are death threats that are involved
in the backlash and you're broad painting too broad of a stroke he's like i don't know how
to explain this the easiest way possible but uh i hate everything makes a statement saying you know
in the world there is only a planet and then rags is like was a lot more on the planet
and then uh tro comes back with uh it's not just everything but the planet rags yeah i that does
not make sense the the definition of backlash supports me absolutely why would you go through
the trouble like this is this is unprecedented levels of pedantry right this is the kind of
shit that i'm built for because i go this far with some of this stuff but this is even surprising me
i hate everything says the backlash is completely ridiculous rags says no it's not like a lot of it
is deserved that tro is like he's talking about the people trying to kill everyone rags it's like no
he's not though that's not what backlash means simple as that like this is ridiculous oh boy
oh all this worked to fucking shoot yourself in the foot don't hear about it just because it has
the word star wars slapped on the cover of it it then says comes across as if a large majority
oh look how negative paul a is the last star wars that i'll ever see kind of reminds me of
jar reminds me of destiny too i'm done yeah yeah what is paul a done with destiny why isn't
paul a holding on to the light at all costs fuck you paul a russian the darkness wins paul i totally
take it back paul a is not reasonable my gay is a way better guy i'm a comrade m that's that's
almost comrade so gotta be yeah communist propaganda yeah definitely a russian part oh yeah
it's con it's comrade musk the waste of time like like waste of time is like a it's like a section
of the body waste of time i am a hero and this is my waste of time into these movies with the
sole intention of hating them how oh do you do you see that last bit i love this it's just proving
it wrong completely the um the word star wars the the comment that just said i want to try and
pause if it's kind of out of sync for us just trying like there okay so if that's enough that
was built up in the previous movie is the character of luke is just ignored the character
of luke is a completely different person than what we have seen the main character is not
believable at all in terms of what she can do hint to movie creators flawless character something
yeah yeah so that's included into the ridiculous backlash it's like come on tro it was a bad video
that he made it didn't make sense when you make a video it takes a level of um you have to make a
conscious effort to put in background footage right and so when you select things specifically
as you are talking over it and saying things specifically the things that you say in the back
if they contradict what you are saying that's a problem very much so and i just don't i don't
understand how it's a waste of time it's on screen for for tro and yet he extrapolates
sees talking about all the people who are talking about murdering the director you're like it's on
the screen man surely you saw that when you were editing this movie i saw it went in my video i
mean is why didn't you see it when you were editing yours was this i hope this was a part
of the video that you actually did how could you pop oh that's the thing it might not be
because tro does the audio he sends it to editors and then they edit up the footage so
he has to approve it but this could explain why there's such a disjointed element to his
videos in which like the visuals don't always you know match up i suppose yeah maybe that's
a thing you should stop doing then well you know he proof proof watches these videos i assume so
i mean ultimately it's on him it's in the video and he's going to upload it but it's just very
strange that he would contradict himself so blatantly possibly know that or is that shit
you're just making up as an excuse to avoid actual criticisms that people make but he doesn't know
that i'm asking i'm asking yeah that was a question yeah that's the question that i'm asking
so his statement was premised with the fact that he doesn't know it we're taking it too seriously
or we're nitpicking or we just went in wanting to hate it how something comes across is not
knowledge it is perception he really really likes mike a pulley and conrad muskovich
conrad muskovich uh he just he just explained what rags did and he's trying to sell it as a
contradiction but it's not all right yeah knowledge is uh knowledge is facts information
and skills acquired by a person through experience or education the theoretical or practical
understanding of a subject so yeah it is knowledge not just that but he was like
it's perception it's like this whole video is rags his perception of course it's it's a
awareness or familiarity gained by experience of a fact or situation so yeah i don't know why you'd
go through all the trouble to be wrong damn the dictionary is a lot of people's kryptonite on
youtube isn't it look i just like you just google this shit this is why i talk in pretty
lay terms same you know same same reason i do that talk to people especially because you can
you don't dumb what i can say to rags is there's a beginning a middle and an end
or i could say to rags there is an additive tripling you see you're like what so there's
like three narratives or like rags didn't you take the literature course i recommended or is
that like a style of music and what we'll follow is an explanation of why he perceives that to
give him the vitriol we then go back to the avoid quizzes and part which bit of a jump but all right
mate and then there is this 40 seconds so but it was a i just wanted it was a question he said
bit of a jump this coming from the guy who was like trying to jump all over the place when you
were saying like when you compared his statements about the last jedi to destiny two and then he
jumped to you're completely talking about a different thing and yeah and there's no real
element of hope in destiny not like there isn't stalled so that's such a bizarre statement to be
still explanation of why he perceives that do you know what do you know what i think i'm putting my
tim foil hat on for this one i reckon this screenshot was taken by i hate everything as
a search for um like lowest reviews or something because like half star half star half star do you
think he's trying to say that to give the film a half star is ridiculous maybe i mean he kind of
he does give that impression in his video i forget if he explicitly states it because it's been so
long but he kind of said he kind of said it to me and wolf where he was when we compared it to the
room and he was like but the room is bad it's like this film is bad he's like no though it's like it's
not fake i'll say that it definitely comes across as a sacred cow sort of thing it's just weird like
yeah i can i can ever any movie i could go to citizen kane and filter by reviews and there
will be half star reviews of it and i could screenshot that absolutely and yeah again like
i said tinfoil hat i have no no reason to assume it left or right i just i just it seems interesting
to me like that may be the message he was going for with this because the top and bottom comments
from brian v and mike a the russian bots they both provided pretty strong arguments or at least um
quick arguments you know like distilled ones from something you could turn into a video
and it's like there's nothing hyperbolic about them that you could have that in reverse someone
going you know i'm so happy right now i love this movie it was so engaged i mean mike a mike a here
that's basically just he's just giving his feelings about it and who are you to tell mike that his
feelings are wrong yeah that's given the vitriol we then go back to the avoid criticism part which
bit of a jump but all right mate and then there is this 40 second segment where they're clearly
arguing different points it says that if people went into this movie expecting to hate it then
no he didn't say if he didn't say if people went in he said that was the reason people went into
this movie expecting to hate it or wanting to hate it which is why i hung onto it so much because
he's assuming people's intentions he's assuming that the people who didn't like this were people
who went into the theater expecting to hate it or who had already decided to hate it you sound
pretty definitive saying that like obviously to definitively prove it we're gonna have to hope he
plays the clip because we can't dance between videos but i'm going to assume that you're uh
you're very definitive on that because you know that's what he said but we'll see
but yeah i could be i guess i could be mistaken i guess we'll find out well yeah we'll see if he
plays it really childish rakston says that i h e has emotionally attached himself tro you yourself
said that he was being sentimental yeah he has emotionally attached himself to the film yeah he
has even he said that's me and wolf really sentimental he's like why do i like this film
so much more like there's you know subjectivity for you i guess it's a complicated thing but
emotions feels condescending to actually explain that you can be emotionally attached to something
and that will be a huge reason for why you can't look at it critically so that that's like just
normal that happens is induced from his previous arguments but as i disagree with a few of his
previous arguments i don't see the final conclusion here as particularly as i said i h e has been more
than ready to criticize the prequels which is a fair proportion of the we we aren't talking about
the prequels yeah no we're talking about the last jedi stop this what about ism star wars brand did
it not occur to you that maybe it would be far more wise to not instantly assume that people
went into this movie expecting to hate it and that maybe they have some serious legitimate
criticisms that you should listen to and take to heart kind of like the ones you showed in that
screenshot but also yeah i i'm i don't wonder what i said that was unreasonable i guess we'll find
out this is where the neater thing comes back i do not believe rags is purposely being misleading
here but it seems he's so used to people actually behaving like that but he seems to have forgotten
what okay so to clarify rags do you believe that i hate everything believes that anyone who didn't
like the last jedi went into the film wanting to hate it um no but that's what he put across
there's hardly anybody who would but if he makes the statement what's rags gonna do
yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna play off what i what yeah i'm not gonna try to dig into people's
heads too much but when you say something i'm more likely to go by what you say than what i think you
mean yeah rags hands were tied assuming that clip is what rag said it was obviously we can't
play it because i don't know why tro didn't play it considering it would have completely
counted the argument if it was accurate especially when he told me that playing clips would have
helped but yeah interesting stuff hg actually set and the point has recreated itself in his head
as some sort of thing that a regressive would say but it is no yeah it is yes because that's
what regressives do the thing that regressives do i'm not saying you're necessarily a regressive
i'm saying this is something that regressives do they will label and dismiss that is what they do
everyone is going like to say to go in hating it already it's like well yeah that's that's
basically bigotry that they're accusing people of yes you're accusing us of bigotry of a kind yes
and it's like because we have star wars it's not the same it's like oh you could be about anything
it doesn't really matter you're like they just went in wanting to hate the film that is labeling
and dismissing and that is they that is a key thing that regressives will do so and he would
never say anything like that he then follows this point well why don't you play the clip
if you never said anything like it just play the clip playing clips is only something that i have
to do yeah with a point about mischaracterization and we'll let the self-explanatory irony do the
magic there nah guys haters gonna hate that's it they're just they're all these haters it's all
they're doing they're just hating it then makes a joke believe it or not i don't understand yeah
i don't know i was gonna pause and respond but i was like i don't know i didn't catch what the
point was there i think the point is that he i don't know what his point is actually
well we well you can discuss it while i pee let's let's just rewind and give it a shot
aggressive would say but i actually is no repressive and he would never say anything like that
he then follows this point with a point about mischaracterization and we'll let the self-explanatory
irony do the magic there nah guys haters gonna hate that's it they're just they're
all these haters it's all they're doing they're just hating so that was mischaracterization and
assuming tiara was saying how cruel of rags to say that uh tiara i hate everything he's saying
hate is gonna hate when i hate everything said people are going into this movie with the intention
to hate it like that doesn't sound like a mischaracterization to me but hey all right what's
it what was his point really what i got from it is that he says that you you perform a bit of
mischaracterization and you take what he said and turn it into hate is gonna hate when no that's
what i'm saying that he's saying well that's i was gonna say it's like if if he if i hate
everything said people are going into this film hoping to hate it like are you saying hate is
gonna hate yeah that yeah it's pretty simple very lost it then makes a joke believed or not through
a voice juxtaposing the cute kid with the aggressive vitriol i think the response to the last jedi has
kind of left fans in a weird place yeah i thought it sucked and i want everyone involved to die
and rags then reflects ihg's point of view by voicing him i love the last jedi so much that
i think it's a good idea to instantly paint the people who didn't like it as a bunch yeah there
are extremes on both sides yes excellent point rags it's almost i wasn't i wasn't actually
mocking him i think my voice was pretty good yeah and uh so rags pastes a picture of i hate
everything on himself and he makes a silly voice and you're saying hey rags stop taking i hate
everything seriously when he's making a silly voice and it's like can't we just say that right
back to you that's the problem with this video it's so beyond like not self-aware because honestly
i got i got a lot of compliments on my ihg voice and and i and i thought i was all right considering
that i don't normally do voices but i thought it was pretty good i thought it was all right
bunch of haters which i didn't care for at first but this comes back later there are because that
makes a fair point i didn't care for it oh very well you didn't care never mind the point of what
i was getting at but okay she says that people hated the last jedi for some reason seems to me
that the accepted opinion is now that this film is really bad and it ruins style wow it's something
with two upvotes and and now we're this is why i hate everything's video is retarded it's like
wait so now he's talking about people saying that it's a bad film rather than people saying
directors need to be killed hey he got comrade and plus he very prominently displays the last
star wars movie that i'll ever see okay they didn't like the movie they don't want to yeah
how is that different than saying i'm done with destiny i'm yeah wolf was right he's he's thrown
in comrade moskovich in there for some reason and obviously ras correctly points out well if
that's the accepted opinion then maybe you should explore why people have that opinion
sounds pretty reasonable to me and you shouldn't say things like for some reason when the internet
is full of videos and chocked with reviews of people explaining why they feel that way
although i h e does finish his sentence with even though star wars was already ruined
three times prior implying that he's not suggesting whether i don't even think that's a
counter to what rag said yeah that's not that's not saying that oh you can't star wars was ruined
what 10 years 20 years ago already so like three bad star wars movies came out 20 years ago so star
wars as a brand was ruined it's too late you can't have a bad movie now once there's a bad movie i
can't get back it's not like me and wolf get progressively more depressed every time an alien
film comes out yeah i mean like there were a lot of people who saw rogue one and they like really
revitalized how they felt about star wars yeah and some people like some people said rogue one was
the death of star wars and then they'd be like no last jedi's revitalized uh solo's the death
solo revitalized it's all over the place is it is it that is that is it that unreasonable to say
that people's excitement for a series ebbs and flows yeah i mean you look at especially when
you look at games ask people you know how they feel about games like call of duty or assassin's
creed these series that have high moments and low moments and a lot of people like this game and
hate this game and ask 10 different people and you'll get 10 different answers so this is the
same way tro really not paying attention to i had everything's video how could you say such negative
things about a product that's all about positivity and then also exactly what do you mean he keeps
reestablishing that i hate everything shits on the prequels all the time it's like you realize
that's a part of the exact same series the series about keeping the darkness away go for the light
holding on to the light keeping away the darkness that's the thing man that's what i mean
such a hypocritical video but like tiara's doing his best to just try and ignore those bits i guess
star wars last jedi is a good or bad movie but he's emphasizing that the franchise will
likely be fine as a whole mostly independent from your opinions on the last jedi now if i was in
rags not what rags responded to yeah why are you talking about stuff that wasn't at all to do with
what rag said does jeez position i would also respond that the last jedi is in a very different
place from the prequels and that the prequels being bad films couldn't really have too much
implication on the established sequence that already been set up by the original trilogy
what in the fuck did he just say um you're gonna have to redo because i was about to pause and ask
the same thing i don't have any idea why they feel that way although it does finish his sentence with
even though star wars was already ruined three times prior implying that he's not suggesting
whether all that would say is that you can ruin it multiple times so it's not really ruined
that was weird make internet cut out for a second oh okay oh nothing nothing of substance was said
oh i didn't expect that wait is the video still up to date with you is it on 1545
uh it is now like like it cut out if you haven't if you haven't heard what he's about to say
and he's going to do the thing where he puts all the words on screen which by the way i don't like
to say this right i feel kind of mean saying it but i don't know about you guys do you watch
colossal is crazy at all no i don't know so i've been a big fan of colossal is crazy for a long
time i know tiaro and colossal is crazy of friends and colossal is tiaro feels like colossal
is crazy light as in he does he's very similar uh and that that little like words going boom boom
boom boom on the screen i could have sworn that started with colossal but i'm just it's bad
putting it out there don't do that it feels a lot like tiaro because this is the thing colossal did
he would cover specific people or like a topic something that's relevant he doesn't do it as
much anymore he just takes fucking ages to do anything but like tiaro seems to have sort of
taken over or he's trying to take over and he also happens to have the pompous british accent
which by the way i'm not saying it's a bad accent like it's what colossal has and i love colossal's
accent um but it's just there's a lot of little things where i'm like oh it's not really your
own thing there but hey and plus when people can listen to what you're saying and understands you
don't confuse it by having the words flash up like that just don't it's extra work just don't do
it well i mean i got my own issue with that i think that's just lazy editing because you're
like what else am i going to do i'll just flash the words on screen to make sure people are fully
asleep it's bizarre here's the worst way that i could do subtitles but to clarify i do actually
i'm okay with influence right like you can see a style of art and be like i want to try and do
that myself and that's fine i just uh there's just so many little things in tiaro's videos that are
like i've seen this before you know the one that keeps getting again you guys have no reference for
this so i apologize obviously but there's i don't know where they're getting it from but there's a
source where you know like it shows people you've never seen before in really clean environments
just walking around or doing a thing i saw that a lot and i ate everything's videos then i saw it a
lot in colossus crazy videos and now i'm seeing it in tiaro videos and they also do a thing where
you show a guy who's on his ipad and he's like sifting through things and there's a green screen
on the ipad that you can crop out with chroma here and then you put the video you're talking
about in it to make it look like this guy is watching that video and like that props up more
in tiaro videos now as well it's just interesting all these little connections again you can do it
it's fine it's just um i don't know i prefer it when you you you watch a video and you're like
this is completely their own style it's cool i guess you can't really do that for tiaro anyway
because he's got several editors so they all have different styles so maybe it's not even him maybe
the people who are editing have gotten well whoever did edit it just don't save yourself the
time don't have it be there oh yeah well here we go wolf do your best to understand what he's about
to say you ready for this yeah i am so ready a movie he's emphasizing that the franchise will
likely be fine as a whole mostly independent from your opinions on the last jedi now if i was in
ranks's position i would also respond that the last jedi is in a very different place from the
prequels and that the prequels being bad films couldn't really have too much implication on the
established sequence that already been set up by the original trilogy therefore so what did he say
pull out of bullshit i don't like a be genuine we've done this before with movie bob i'm not 100
sure of what that was what do you say yeah i'm gonna give it one more try and be yeah let's give
it genuinely as honest as i can trying to figure out last jedi is a good or bad movie but he's
emphasizing that the franchise will likely be fine as a whole mostly independent from your opinions
on the last jedi now if i was in ranks's position i would also respond that the last jedi is in a
very different place from the prequels and that the prequels being bad films couldn't really have
too much implication on the established sequence that already been set up by the original trilogy
so is he saying the prequels being bad doesn't really affect the ot because that's totally not
true um for example darth vader now has a full history so whenever you watch the originals you
can see anakin if you want that's something that a lot of people complain actually that's
something that i hate everything could play to us about remember wolf you said that the prequels
ruined darth vader and yoda oh yeah so so not even i hate everything agrees with you there
i was so young when the prequels came out i i can't really i don't know what the general
acceptance was of them i i don't know um i know what the acceptance of them now is but at the time
i don't know but i i still don't really understand what he's saying um if well some people in the
chat are saying that we've we've got it right in terms of what he's trying to say and my only
question is why did you say it like that like not only that fast not only with the editing style
but the choice of sentence structure like the the words you chose to explain it doesn't matter
how bad the prequels are because they don't affect what moves on from the originals like
that's pretty much what he's saying i think yeah i think that's what he's saying but then again
there's not as much as i feel like there's looking back i feel like there's more about the last jedi
that singularly goes against the ot than all of the prequels oh absolutely i that's actually a
debate that we had with um i had everything and like he said that seeing yoda with a lightsaber
is partially what ruins yoda in the original trilogy and i believe me a wolf actually
argued on the opposite of that i'm not sure where you stand on that wolf but for me
i don't see yoda with a lightsaber ruining yoda in the ot because i mean he's a jedi and jedi have
lightsabers so i don't see that that's a fucking problem i would have preferred that his lightsaber
was like there but he never used it but it doesn't ruin anything for me well i mean the fact that it's
present doesn't pose an issue a lot of people highlight the fact that yoda's very like you
know like i can't remember what his statement is but he's like never use the force to attack and
then they'll splice that with a scene of him going like against kamaduku and my perspective on that
is like yeah but that was before so yoda lost every one of his jedi he lost his temple he lost
everything it's like he might that might change him a bit he might have some interesting things
to say about the force and the jedi after that not to mention wasn't most of yoda's use of the
force in attack of the clones uh to keep duku from killing anakin and obi-wan who were you could
defend yeah he uses it to defend people that seems like a jedi thing to do
so yeah it's and i'm not saying he's definitive right now it's an interesting conversation to
have i'm merely pointing out that um i hate everything himself has declared that the
prequels have a residue that's attacked the ot so to say that it's they're separate from each
other just doesn't make sense really to me especially considering they're all sequels
it's all part of a through line so they all affect each other this this segment is he's
saying what i what he would have said in my place and you wouldn't have said this so
but the thing is didn't he criticize me for making the video all right yeah well this will
just be another one to count on that tro is saying how rags should say his video even though he said
rags shouldn't do that without everything's uh yeah that's all right it's fine this this video
feels like christmas lights where you're just trying to untangle all of it like i don't know
you just kind of want to shake it around hopefully that they're kind of loosening each other up
will we just shake it you throw it around therefore it's understandable the last
year i may feel like it had more of an effect on the future star wars films as a whole but
that's just my two cents but i don't know but we don't know what the future films will be
like what we do now but at the time we didn't know what the effects would be
well you said that's just my two cents that means you can't criticize him
yeah i mean i'm just what i'm saying is i have no idea what episode nine will be like
and i have this morbid curiosity about what they'll do you know oh you know what that just made me
someone just left in the comments well what i said could be extrapolated as a defense of yoda
uh there's a defense of luke saying that what yoda went through changed him um i said in my
videos luke could change to become the luke in the last jedi but we have to see the events
that would have done it we saw the events that would have like do you remember the scene
where yoda reacts to all of his jedi being murdered yeah and even then yoda and the way
that yoda treats luke and the way that luke treats ray yeah and and we get to see yoda in
the council what like eight times or something ridiculous we get to see him planning the war
we see him with the the wookiees he fights palpatine like we get loads of yoda stuff
for why he would have had it down for the first time yoda sees luke is he puts on the act as a way
to test luke yeah there's a lot there's a lot to work with there while luke gets gets one
flashback three times so you know yeah but canto we got canto bite we got canto bite that's that's
fair on that rax then says it took years and years and years for people to turn on the prequels and
basically i would cite plinkett's video was the the big uh culture shift for that one i was one
of many people who watched that and was like oh yeah the prequels aren't as great as i thought
like genuinely and i can't remember how old i was when that released i think it was 2009 because
it was the it was the plinkett reviews for me too and those have millions and millions and
millions of views and that in it it is cited today uh remember when um the last jedi video
when plinkett's last jedi video came out there were articles written about it and those articles
about the last jedi video plinkett did often referenced how impactful culturally the plinkett
reviews on the uh the fan of minis were yeah and this is the thing uh rags is not saying that
nobody hated the prequels when they came out because every there's always someone who hates
something that's just obvious this is standard what he's saying here because i know that this
is going to be twisted what rags is saying here is that like the hatred we're seeing for the last
jedi was nowhere near what the prequels got until many years later yeah but then that actually turned
into memes which was nice it took days it took week i mean it wasn't even months or weeks after
the last jedi that people were like ugh and it just got saying it kept getting worse it started
out bad and it kept getting worse and worse and worse yeah turn them into memes and although i
would not agree and i say many dislike the prequels on release as well as the fact the critic score
never really changed i would definitely agree they're more unpopular now than yeah but what
one thing that's important to note is that the professional critic review at the at the time
the internet wasn't like it is today um the way to back then the critic score was far more easy
to acquire and put out and relied upon so yeah i mean if we're gonna go by the scores too it's
like it's just it's objectively factual that it's got a lower audience score
than phantom menace than attack of the clones is historically isn't it the lowest rated star wars
film in history that's what i remember reading yes it is yeah um and it didn't take long for
that to happen and it i don't think it's gone up since and it took and it happened way quicker too
it got a lower score far far quicker hmm and then word then rags then however firstly uses rotten
tomatoes once again to state objectively the last jelly is the most unpopular star wars film
with audiences that would be a truth then wouldn't it yeah that seems to be uh yeah it's a true
statement and this is you've got to be so slow and careful with the words here because some people
like to twist it and be like how could it be objective if it's based on people's feelings
it's like no we're saying yeah that it has the lowest score look the objective result of the
overall mean uh review is this number compared with this number these are things that are
undisputable because they're on the site like that's the two different things rags not i'm glad
he didn't say rags he's trying to say that the film is definitely bad because people said it was
you know like nothing like that don't as long as he doesn't go that way the last jedi and by a
considerable margin is the worst rated by audience star wars film that has ever existed it took the
prequels many many many years for people to turn on them for the films that they really were despite
the fact that ron and tomahto is in no way necessarily actually reflects universal audience
that's not what rags said though yeah that's not what i said i knew he's gonna do that like i'm
saying it's the lowest score and i can i fucking put out tweets and shit with screenshots just
look at the numbers what number some numbers are higher than other numbers man it's meant on a film
particularly due to target demographics that are more likely to use this yeah there's a million
influences that go into the rotten tomatoes so to say to compare two films on rotten tomatoes would
be fair yeah i'm using i'm using the same metrics for both they're both looked at through the same
lens that's all you said is that it got the worst result i'm saying the score is lower i suppose
someone could argue that if the phantom menace was released today then maybe it would have had
the same response as that but you're not disputing that you literally just said factually this is the
lowest rated star wars film on rotten tomatoes by audience score and it is yeah and it is that's it
right and you can find other sites such as imdb that have the last jedi as more popular than
two i wasn't talking about imdb that's i mean i'm i'm sure you're right but i wasn't talking about
imdb so carrying on now this point would be irrelevant if the logic he followed with was
correct but he then goes on to say when the prequels came out people were at least lukewarm
about them or they thought higher of them but this is the last jedi after two months
what do you think it will be like in two years looking back what do you think it'll be like
five months from now well there are individual circumstances in which the strangely positive
responses you agree so so you agree and all ranks it was asked questions yeah i was like so you agree
i'm saying look at i'm just saying imagine i'm like i'm being like john leonier just imagine
prequels were cultivated in particular there were victims of their own hype and have dated
horribly rags could go into that if he wanted to but he didn't he literally just said
stop it you're over analyzing something that didn't even contradict what you're saying that's
that's the big issue here he's trying to counter you and you haven't said anything that wouldn't
necessarily follow with all of this too i'm just saying look at the scores imagine what it will be
like in the future it doesn't appear to have that and therefore it's unlikely that it will follow
the same route he then says that's kind of an odd defense of the last jedi saying oh yeah but guys
wait 15 years ago these other movies were bad and to that i'll refer you back to what i just said
it's involvement of the prequels is actually justified even if the context does not hold direct
compound a lot of fun casual debates help challenge your viewpoint and only benefit the
overall landscape but a lot of the discussions around this movie are just straight up malicious
and overly simplified rags thing the straight up malicious are overly simplified and they can be
i'm sure yeah there's a lot of stuff that i've watched i mean no they just didn't like the movie
and they criticize the movie it's like why can't i just i don't think the only one you could
possibly refer to is anyone saying i'm going to murder the people who made it it's like beyond
that if you get someone like for example my video my initial one ranting against the film i wonder
if he considers that malicious yeah man is like the what is malicious to you also it's weird he's
using that og but it's it's strange what is malicious exactly it's it's very what's malicious
to some isn't to others you know can you can you be malicious to in criticism of a movie like
intent to do harm it's like that seems a bit hyperbolic but fine let's see let's see where
they go with it and count this is by saying really you think so because i knew i was going
to do this video for quite a while and i watched a lot of star wars conversations about it i even
had my own stream and on that stream was mauler he ended up creating three extremely comprehensive
videos talking about criticisms regarding the last jedi now rag's point only worked if i
is denying the existence of a lot of reasonable discussions yeah but rag said really huh my
experience is this yeah i'm saying that i don't see the thing that you claim is around
i even set out by saying that's weird isn't that what i said i say that's weird or like that's
odd yeah and the only response tro can have to this is like well he's sharing his experience and
i hit everything he's shared his moving on yeah that's it i guess yeah which he isn't he was just
stating that they loaded these discussions appear unreasonable why is this playing in the background
it's a part of i hit everything's videos so the person editing right now thought it would be
see this is this is a very fundamental of editing right so in my videos if i reference
one of them when i'm talking about them and i show a clip in one of them that has a clip from
a movie that i was referencing in that video at the time it's very confusing for the viewer because
they think i'm now referencing the movie which is exactly what's happening here what they should
have shown was a picture of i hate everything's opinion disclaimer or is um his face you know
doing something not literally a clip from the deer hunter because now we're like wait is it
relevant to the deer hunter i have a lot of lately sorry i think this is the deer hunter one
and a lot of the other they're not mutually exclusive rags asks him you say a lot of the
discussion about this movie is straight up malicious and overly simplified can you point those out
listen the mass is not yeah that's fair why am i asking for some examples i mean i'm not saying
they don't exist i mean i would say that for the most part they don't i would say that the vast
majority of criticism isn't malicious in the way that he's trying to paint especially with the
beginning of i hate everything's video there's such an innocent reasonable here this is an
innocent response from rags here just being like i didn't experience this can you show some of your
examples and then yeah because i was just trying to like desperately rip into it last jedi response
videos i watched oh i can't even remember how many i can't i couldn't i could probably i watched so
many i could probably rewatch some and not know that i've watched them the first time it's just
you just soak it all up and i was never like man these are malicious people they're bad people
awesome you say a lot of the discussion about this movie is straight up malicious and i think this
was my video um yeah no this is some reason it sucked critical thinking uh ramp compilation
uh let's try is a horrible movie uh just a lot of thoughts and vlogs and i mean i just
it's like yeah there's a lot of an overly simplified can you point those out listen
the mass is not hard to find youtube videos are not the only media what do you mean rags literally
just said he's finding it hard to find and then you're like it's not hard to find it's
like if it's not so fucking hard to find why don't you show some examples jesus christ this is not
hard dim of the discussion let's pull up some of the examples that i gathered in around 10 minutes
so okay if these are examples these need to be examples of what was it malicious malicious
is it malicious criticism like just just malicious in general let's see the malicious
oh it's a comment it's not even a video it's a comment that has no a month old comment with
no thumbs up oh seriously oh wow it's gonna be comments yeah even though we've just been over
the getting death threats is so common on the internet that it's no there's no point in even
referencing it okay so oh jesus christ i guess my mistake was i went to the actual content
i went to videos of youtubers with the tens of thousands of views and all the subs and i got
to all the people who were involved in the community and i went to all of these videos
when i should have been going to the dredges of the comment section as people point out as well
even though he's gone to the comment section to get evidence saying you're an idiot and they've
killed star wars i hardly call that malicious or a threat that's a pretty yeah i should have known
that monk insane with three subscribers a month ago posted before this video was made he found
yes i'm certain that you can find malicious comments if you go to the fucking youtube
comment section i was going to the custom shit that matters i'm sure you could go on a video
about uh creating an omelette and there would be if it was a million views you might find
a comment that has the word interdimensional in it just because that's how crazy comments are
you'll just have everything in there yeah oh my god idiot the last jedi sucked balls they killed
star wars you're a hypocrite again malicious threats you're bar is so low you snowflake
medical idiot your opinion what he's laughing that's harmless you're laughing so harmless
what the fuck oh my god screw you screw you oh god screw you this is like i feel that this review
is biased is malicious screw you is malicious i love i'm sorry tro you were so smug about this
section like this took me seconds to find it's like this is not evidence at all awful you should
feel bad like i heard that tiro made a tweet where he was considering taking this video down
you should have it's a bit late now it's too late yeah it's too late now i i saved myself a copy
i feel that this i can't believe that's reference to malicious that's insane also i level these
these russian ball fucking profiles bug bug boosts that's the fucking russian if i ever see
subs and no character profile image review is biased i want to smash your head against the wall
there you go that's a malicious one you got me wow i hope you can castrate it just like this
oh so i'm on a different one to you guys yeah there you go idiot terrible plot thousands of
plot holes ruined all the main characters social justice for your bs terrible terrible movie
one of my mods just said is wolks wolf's bike dead it's like no he's just uh i guess he's
just fucking observing me and rags ripping into this well um actually um he's having pizza
well no i'm pretty sure he finished that like an hour ago um i'm actually gonna call it a day
um yeah so seen a lot of people in the chat post about it and you know mauler i've read
talked to you a lot about it rags talked a little bit about it uh yeah i'm gonna be
posting a video pretty soon i was planning tomorrow it might be tonight instead um
you know a lot of shit that's been going on for the past three months
uh a lot of accusations that are incorrect outright bullshit i guess medicare got some
comment on one of his streams about it so it's kind of all over the place now so
don't really feel like i can really add much to the stream at this point i got you so um
yeah i think you know it's gonna be a while before i'm back on efap we're back on youtube
in general just because i need time to you know fucking not deal with shit so probably
gonna post the video later this afternoon or tonight at some point but uh yeah it's just
got to i i don't think i can really add much you guys are more better with the critical analysis
of this cluster fuck of a video anyway so all right well yeah i mean me and rags can fucking
i think even just one of me and rags would have been able to run this stream with how much we talk
but like yeah um so don't be confused chat you shouldn't know much about this if you don't know
anything about it but wolf's going to release a video about some stuff that's been going on um
and from there is probably going to take a break for a bit uh so you'll be there's needless to say
there's a reason for like why i was so um passionate about the Kavanaugh case because
it's really reflective of shit i've been dealing with for months and yeah it's
it's kind of shitty when you see comments like it all the fucking time
every single day day in day out and uh yeah i feel like i'm not really
going to be able to add much to the stream so thinking you guys can uh you can always send us
some messages if you ever need anything you know absolutely and i'm sure you'll be missed on efap as
well so make sure you don't take too long yeah i don't know how long it'll be but um i love you too
um but yeah the video will go in depth in it because it's a pretty big fucking video i've been
working on it for a lot of weeks at this point so i got you yeah so the video will explain itself
and uh yeah i'm just gonna call it a day was uh fun how it lasted i hope you guys survive the
next hour and a half oh i'm sure we'll be fine plenty of material to destroy oh yeah yeah well
be well but take the break you need to yeah yeah we'll be around we always are
yeah well um you know i'll uh see you guys later yeah see you man
and yeah uh we'll probably just like when we get to the end of the stream i'll say something
again about what is sort of going on there but it is more for wolf to talk about and
there are people who i don't know if they're doing it as a joke or if they're doing it because
they think that there's there's like a strong case me there's podcasts especially the chat or
or my discord or even my youtube videos not really a place where i like to have um discussion on those
sorts of extremely personal topics so if you find comments being removed deleted or whatever it's
literally just because um it's it's against rules or terms of service as you put it we've got our
own rules set up in um our discord i'm sure rags is the same it's um proliferation of of what is
essentially pretty harmful content it's the ideas of uh as he said it's it's come up recently in the
political arena so you'll get all the context you need uh i don't know if wolf said it was tonight
or tomorrow but he'll be releasing a video for it in the meantime me and uh me and rags are going
to continue with tiaro's absolute slam dunk that there of course exists negative uh malicious
videos out there by referencing what was that like not even videos five well i was gonna say
by referencing five comments that weren't even malicious and to the kind of we're uh this is
like like you know i'll go as far as saying no they absolutely were but um again you could
you know what's really funny about this rags you could have told me these comments were on any video
and i'd believe you oh yeah that's just do you oh yeah well there's now if i went to the youtube
comment section and found some mean comments it's like yeah no shit
anyway do you find did you find anything that matters that's the thing if he showed a video
of some guy like in a vlog saying i'm gonna fucking kill ryan johnson it'd be like oh wow
like that that does seem like a little bit more credible than just you know a selection of words
in a comment on a random video that everyone gets on everything very strange just a plot
ruined all the main characters social justice warrior bullshit i mean the the in the the voices
that go well is to make them look even less reasonable ranks it's a very clever idea
i see it's a terrible terrible movie you can try to sound intelligent with your uh big words
but you're fucking dumb if you think the last jetty was good with its plot holes
blatant what about that was malicious is it is it malicious to call someone dumb
um f kingdom if you call someone dumb is okay but fucking dumb that's too far
the pushing and it's mary sue honestly honestly honestly you can just fuck off wow you're either
being paid by kathleen kennedy or your virtue signaling this was a horrible movie only humor
was to see more trashing of the last jedi this section proves that there are people who did not
like the last jedi i suppose yeah thanks for this you got me needed this i there are people out
there who didn't like it yeah that's that's what i was saying yep this is ruined but you
come off more of an antifa member with talking antifa member i don't know why they need to go
there but sure but that makes no sense this plot was garbage unless your iq was 17 and you're just
a moron help you drop a shit tone of subs you're an idiot if you can't criticize shit i like that
and say it's a good film why are people enjoying things i don't oh so was that the point of this
section i i guess i guess one it was to counter your point and prove that there are malicious
people making videos but whatever yeah i was i was kind of going for the shit that matters but
i guess he found so he found some mean comments on the on the youtube comment section so yeah all
right come on come on it's unlike every video wow come the whole movie is sjw propaganda there are
plenty of asian cast in hollywood yeah i agree and i'm sure the comments saying yeah i don't know
the whole movie is actually there are plenty of asians casted in hollywood you are out of line
i don't okay all right i'm not i'm just not going to read that you're offended by the political
message being noticed by people who are smart enough not to be indoctrinated by a hypocrite
woods agenda because you're already a sheeple shill but you just don't know it when you
say take away all the story pacing character tone physics lore etc problems then you have nothing
left not a movie just the most expensive toy commercial ever made and it didn't sell any toys
at xmas time all that was on the toy shelves were star wars toys epic fail as this video is pal as
is this video that's not that that bad yeah like i get it it's a little bit like you don't need the
political bit but even even with it's like not that bad it's weird though because when i was
saying i wasn't finding the stuff i noticed i showed like videos that people made but he went
like oh i'm not gonna i'm not gonna do the thing that he's looking for i'm gonna go somewhere
completely different i'm gonna look for it for a completely different kind of thing than what was
clearly displayed to me did he miss the part where you already admitted that you know this happens
for everything remember the yeah i yeah at the very very very beginning of the video i was like
yeah snap and say everything everything it is kind of i'm not reading this one either you can
see the irony uh-huh that reveal wait wait how was that ironic i guess if you call someone a racist
then it's clear that you're the racist i i guess i what i will give them the biggest benefit of
the doubt possible overly simple and assume that they they're going to be criticizing him for saying
it's good that they casted an asian person if he said that i don't even know and to to deny that
would be racist i assume that's that's what i'll go for whatever it doesn't really matter
because it wasn't even tro that said it it was some other guy uh i'm not sure best thing to come
out of this treasure trove of intelligence is idiot review wow so malicious what why so this
section turned into like a comedy bit i i guess i mean it was funny but supposed to be malicious
terrible horrible things but were like intended to laugh at them because they shouldn't be taken
seriously why did you bother me and rags could find you a list of the reverse people saying this
film is incredible you should just fucking die yeah they exist too so like it sounds like a boohoo
sort of thing to me hmm i'm like because i because when i said i couldn't find i didn't see any of
that maliciousness what i did was i showed a big list of youtube videos that were made
a lot of those by big names and he was like oh well instead since he showed youtube videos
instead i'll go somewhere completely different i'll go to the youtube comment section i'll find
comments like okay i was i was hoping that he could use videos i say that's a bit more than
a dozen and on top of that no it's not tro you didn't prove your point at all yeah
it's anything the whole section was fucked yeah you kind of downplayed anything malicious really
i have to i need him to be here right and say to him tioro whatever your name is do you think that
rags thinks there's not a single comment online that's malicious toward people about the last
jedi do you think that's what rags was saying and of course the answer is well obviously not because
rags isn't retarded like you would never say that there's not someone out there who threatened to
kill somebody because of how bad the last jedi is because it happens to everything and everyone
it's just this is like think for a fucking second that you didn't counter rags you counted a point
no one made good job in terms of people's takes and their opinions on the last jedi and to paint
them as overly malicious and simplistic is disingenuous from you when he never did that
anyway then we go back to the destiny point a lot of the discussions around this movie are just
straight up malicious and overly simplified you know i think that a lot of the discussion
surrounding destiny 2 was straight up which we've already dug into enough i yes you lost that was
that was a solid point that i made yeah i don't think we dug into it in a way that you you think
that it's been dug into for sure disagree with i h e that there is no middle ground because i'm
kind of on it but his statement is a hyperbole and as i said the film is full of very strong
sentiments which will push more people to one side or the other and often certain extremes can frame
it as there being no middle ground and this next point is something that arises from did i did it
did i say anything about that i was that that was what i h e said well the way he just framed that
was that he doesn't even agree that there's no middle ground if i'm assuming that you may have
said that there's absolutely middle ground and that no i i think he was saying that i h e made
the comment that is like it seems like there's no middle ground but i mean there's always middle
ground so i don't know let me use the loo real quick even with mama
you've dug into this yeah i don't think so let me rewind see if we can get some extra
just in simplistic is disingenuous from you when he never did that anyway then we go back to the
destiny point but a lot of the discussions around this movie are just sorry is that the way that's
edited at any way then we go back to the destiny point but a lot of the he cuts himself off he says
like point and then i think he's going to say point i want to see what rag said in this bit
intelligence is idiot review wow speechless really i just don't know i'm doing i say that's
a bit more than a dozen and on top of that raz claims but i watched a lot of content in terms
of people's takes and their opinions on the last jedi and to paint them as overly malicious
and simplistic is disingenuous from you when he never did that anyway yeah i guess it could be
extrapolated that uh you've you've assumed that i hate everything is referring to everyone that
way but that's tied into the whole broad strokes thing because i had everything's not just talking
about people who threaten murder he's also talking about people who are just critical of the film
you know the way that he lumps everything together and the immense amount of time he spends talking
about it and playing with it yeah and he's kind of fucked because of that one screenshot of the
perfectly reasonable accounts basically criticizing the film in the same way that i would
and therefore if those people are malicious and simplistic then i suppose i'm in that same
collective i have to be because i would be saying the same things as them like i don't think that's
too much of a jump from rags i think that's perfectly reasonable yeah i mean all right if
that's how you felt but you know i i got what i got wait then we go back to the destiny point but a
lot of the discussions around this movie are just straight up malicious and overly simplified you
know i think that a lot of the discussion surrounding destiny 2 was straight up which
we've already dug into enough yeah my point was pretty damn good yeah yeah i got no problem i still
understand his his counter to that agree with i h e that there is no middle ground because i'm kind
of on it but his statement is a hyperbole and as i said the film is full of very strong sentiments
which will push more people to one side or the other and often certain extremes can frame it as
there being no middle ground and this next point so he he justifies the fact that i hate everything
said there's no middle ground by saying with stuff like this it's it's easy to see there's no middle
ground it's like so you're saying that there is a middle ground and he misses that a lot of videos
were around well that's kind of what i'm getting at is like there is no middle ground but also i
guess that there is but i can see how someone would say there isn't it's just like okay it's
inaccurate but it's fair to say sure yeah it's something that arises as the comments are saying
here i h e is clearly inflating the malicious aspect of it in order to try and defend absolutely
yeah i mean that's part of why a lot of people made their videos the way they did right to try and
be less hyperbolic to try and have the opposite side listen you know because it's pretty clear
that if you shout at somebody it's rare that they'll actually take in what you're saying that's like
you could say there's there's almost a counterculture for that because i'm not the only
one who made like long assessments of the film there's there's a lot of people out there
so it's over the comment section it's over rags tiaro has the middle ground
why are you giving to people who say that any kind of attention well because they exist that's
part of the point oh fuck off you give them attention if they exist oh if people exist
they okay if people exist you give them attention there's no that's going to bite them in the ass
one day whenever whenever tiaro says why are you covering x just just have that prepared in your
own head does they exist does they exist that's good enough reason to cover it some somebody out
there who has the most ridiculous silly ridiculous trolly opinion that exists on the last jedi like
should you ignore them because there's nothing of merit no cover them because they exist you know
that person i referenced earlier on the on the the omelette video who mentions interdimensional
realities i cover them they exist yeah why not yeah of this video that those people seem
overrepresented in the car they they're only they seem over yeah sure yeah they're absolutely
circular if they seem overrepresented then how you don't overly represent them is you don't
represent them someone said tiaro is on point here he hasn't made sense for a while now
yeah this is pretty bad this is one of those circular sorts of things
like they're part of the discussion because they exist they said you keep pausing before he
finishes a fucking sentence mate he talks too fast you've got to slow him down and uh he's
made points as he goes he says that he covers them because they exist then he moves on to say
that um that it seems to be more negative towards uh like i'm guessing the last jedi obviously
because that's the topic and both of those points are wrong like it will not reason enough
the fucking idea to cover a comment literally because it exists you don't you think that's
that's a pretty that's like the that's literally the lowest standard you could possibly have let's
be fair rags let's play the comment again just to make sure certain extremes can frame it as
there being no middle ground and this next point is something that arises from that why are you
giving the people who say that any kind of attention well because they exist that's part
of the point of this that's a that's a point that's a that's a congealed sentence yes because
they exist and now he's moving on so is there anyone in chat who thinks that that's completely
reasonable as a reason to cover somebody because they exist like i'm not saying okay maybe it's
unclear it's like of course you can but it's not a reason to do something they exist someone's
saying why did you eat that mold well it exists it's bizarre to be like it because as uh as rags
just said it's like why not go for people with matter this is a common problem for i hit everything
by the way like his comment comeback videos he always picks the insane people and it's sad
because the man can actually have discussion it's possible so why not take the strong arguments
why not go with strong arguments instead of the insane ones yeah i mean some of these don't a lot
of these comments that he highly that he highlighted they're not even like they're not even
malicious first off but they're just insane and deranged like why even engage it yeah you know
it's just it's insane like um do you remember making a point i'm just using this an example
not like trying to be vain here but um my video where where i'm talking about the bombs dropping
i said that i looked all over online i found four arguments in total in favor of the bombs
dropping and i i think i disproved three of them and then one of them i said this is actually fair
reasoning and this could work i was like did you see like the conversation that completes there
it's like oh this is actually an interesting piece of reasoning for why this this thing would
work this way instead i could have just grabbed a bunch of comments that were like you don't think
bombs drop in space you should die bombs are made out of anti-gravity generating blueberry jam
it's like well and then it's like more why why are you covering the people who are saying you
should die if you think bombs can't be dropped in space and then i go well because they exist
they exist i mean really you have to cover every comment with that reasoning yeah at that point
shouldn't this video be filled with millions of comments i don't know
they exist this video that those people seem overrepresented in the current star wars
discuss i love that slippery language they seem over overrepresented like yeah i don't i don't
see it i don't see it that's exactly what rags already said and he's shown that rags like it
didn't seem that way to me here's my perception and he shows all the videos and the response is
look at these comments i've picked out of millions potentially billions yeah i mean like one of them
had like two upvotes after a month man and if your problem is that they seem overrepresented
then why did you spend so much time in your video putting them front and center yeah and laughing at
them and stuff which which is rightful you should be laughing a handful of them because they're silly
like the one that you know whatever like the as rags just said it's like you talk about how it's
like this overwhelming or at least it's a majority of some form but um you also show show comments
that have no support do you see do you see how that's interesting it's like if you for example
if you pulled a comment that said i ate everything should die and it has like a thousand upvotes that
would be a little bit worrying so there you go there's there's his spiel discussion and it's
nauseating and unreasonable a lot of content is built on responding to people who are being
unreasonable and ridiculous i'm sure rags has responded to people being unreasonable and
ridiculous as well he's not promising it oh yes me rags have responded to people being unreasonable
and ridiculous yes and we had a gay old time to say whether the last shy is good or bad he's just
trying to quell the outrage not really too because we you can take a bad example because these videos
that we talk about especially on efap they try to make points a lot of the times they might not be
very well stated they might be contradictory but they have methods of reasoning and there is some
sort of thing being said in these things it is usually they're coming to a very specific point
usually like for example the the thanos when we covered his specific point was the mcu of
endorsed abuse as love that was the the entire video was sort of in favor of that point uh
mackintosh's overall point was the the last jedi is about men learning to accept women as people
who can help you grow or something like that like these essays usually come to a point and
everything is in favor of it so we we go through each part and we judge how accurate to reality it
is yeah like the people i make videos to they don't speak gibberish in the truest sense of the
word like they make points they're trying to get across an idea a lot of the times they're articles
that are filled with thoughts that attempt to push a narrative or to try and convince us of something
it's not just a random call it's not a five-word comment on the internet that says
you are you're crazy or you're stupid or you're horrible because like what's to discuss about it
i'm going to say this is ridiculous but questioning if it's really something worth getting to the
powerful levels of anger that many have expressed and once again how would you be able to determine
that anyway exactly that's another thing that's a problem with i had everything's video telling
people they should or should not feel well maybe i should clarify that before someone takes me out
of context to say that someone shouldn't be x amount of angry about a film that's not a thing
yeah that's strange i don't know how you would be able to quantify that or apply that or
by what it was like what it said earlier on this video because saying it's a star wars movie like
yeah it is a star wars movie but that in and of itself doesn't mean that people can't be upset
about it to a degree and i wonder if you know you remember that video where patrick williams was
like i can't stop thinking about this film it's amazing would you be like dude can you chill down
like oh now like you get a bit of like you can't love it that much it's just a film you know like
love being the uh antonym to hate at this point in my in my assessment i'm saying if you're not
allowed to hate it that much surely you're not allowed to love it that much too yeah it's gotta
work both ways it's gotta work both ways you quantify anger with the amount of steam coming
from their head this is one of those things that people say that we do like we're trying to gate
keep how much you're supposed to feel about something yeah but this isn't really a point
that we make so much as it's a point that other people make in defense of it but people attribute
it to us for some reason it's telling ig what he should be talking about it's his fucking you're
doing that right now yeah but what is this video video all we know is that this is a video about
the last jedi then this inductive reason but you already established the rags would have seen it
so he knows exactly what the video is all about which one is it also this music's annoying
his name returns when i h e says i've seen the last jedi three times at the cinema now
i never see anything that many times
which you can absolutely say this you can say i never see a film more than whatever
so that it but to the audience we're saying they're like what the fuck does that mean
this is like okay because i kind of hate going to the cinema and suddenly ranks puts words into
his mouth holy shit he doesn't see anything that amount of times but but but but but the last jedi
was just so good he did he he did see it that's the implication of course i'm not even and he says
that i'm putting words in his mouth and i haven't yet i'm saying what he said well you you said
because did did you say because of how good it is so he could argue that you're saying that he's
saying he saw it because it's good but i'm pretty sure he argues that the film is good
oh yeah he argues it but yeah i'm not putting words in his mouth i'm just restating what he
said and not even from his perspective at many times i mean but it's clearly hyperbolic anyway
and he's used that defense in this video like rags his avatar is like his jaws dropped and he's
like whoa you watched it three times utilizing my fucking avatar right now yeah i mean he normally
dramatizing the side sense completely dramatizing it exactly exactly that's what rags is doing yeah
because ij isn't making a point like do you not understand it like i said the audience wonders
why is he just brought up that he saw it three times that's doesn't that's not indicative of
really anything and it's like i enjoyed it that much it's like okay you already know you enjoyed
uh in chat i h e says i went to see it three times rag says i h e went to say it three times tro says
stop putting words in his mouth instance from alex when as revealed he only watched it three times
today clear grasp on how he felt i h e then says collectively i've seen the film four different
people oh god i hate this bit levels of star wars fan and all of them enjoyed it two of these four
people never go on twitter or reddit so i found their reaction to be genuinely interesting and
rag says poor poor though those four friends so much for the other two it doesn't find you guys
genuinely interesting yeah fuck you too it's kind of weird i could have swore at the beginning of
this video you were criticizing people for wanting to confirm their biases which is a peculiar point
because i h e clearly didn't select his friends to go and watch the movie based on their opinions
on the movie that he would have put that in his video if they all didn't like the film yeah
yeah i i was gonna say i'm pretty sure that was the point you were making not
that i had everything selected his friends to see the film with if if these four friends
had walked into the movie and they thought the movie was bad there is no way he would have put
that in this in this film he made in this uh video he made as they had never seen the movie
when they went with him you see here's the thing here's the thing i can tell you all the times i
hit the bullseye that's the point i'm trying to say i don't have to tell you how many times i
miss the bullseye that i g made earlier of internet echo chambers is that people select
to surround them based on pre you select people that you want to watch based off of how they feel
that's a different conversation rags are saying i hate everything he's bringing these people into
his video and they also just so happen to like the film do you understand it's the same as um
h bomber guy goes on several rants about uh dark souls and he brings in this anecdote about a friend
of his who played dark souls one just didn't like it but then he plays dark souls two and he really
liked it it's like okay what about have you got any friends who felt the reverse it's like well
if he did they're not going to come up yeah and it's strange because however many of your friends
like the movie or not doesn't mean anything exactly that's kind of what you get the whole
thing is like this this doesn't matter like you could have brought a bus load of 100 people in
and they all could have loved the film and made a cult around it but doesn't mean anything knowing
what his friends would come out thinking so this point just doesn't hold up i g then speaks about
his seven fucking what does found that piece of art that's he they're there wow um but did they
research on your avatar apparently that's uh i think i've i've only posted that avatar once
on twitter i think unlike a long time ago that's interesting but um yeah the point is if they
yeah he you can so he can show everyone how many times you hit the full site
i have as value immediate experiences with the film the first viewing i was genuinely
unsure on my i'm sorry okay see if tro was here i have to i beg him do you not understand how
hilarious it is that he says on my third viewing i wasn't bored i can't wait where we get that bit
it's so funny sign me up it's just like what are you what kind of what if you weren't bored okay
feelings but had an overall positive outlook and vibe the second viewing i had a yeah it's like
there's so little to go by here well yeah this is surface level uh initial vague feelings and you
could be like that's what we're sharing you'd be like but why yeah this is like once you once you
walk out of the the theater here write your thoughts on this fortune cookie quick you're
like uh it's like a six on the emotional scale of happy and you're like okay good thank you
then you watch it again it's like a five now and then the third time you go you know i don't
use a number i was not bored it's like okay feelings had an overall positive outlook and
vibe the second viewing i had a much better time the third time i just had a good experience and
was never bored this vex this course this vexes rags how does this not vex you exactly it's such
a it's nothing that's nothing like what are we supposed to do with that rags who clearly
desires a more substantive argument and maybe he spent too much time around people who like mauler
do seem for seem reviews that is no discretion you don't need to okay if you're you've been brought
up you have been brought up but but he's he's saying like okay mauler he does it seem for
seem reviews uh i had everything he's sharing initial reactions but i had everything knows
how to be substantive he's done it before yeah and i'm not this is the typical quite frankly
stupid shit that i hate seeing is that oh you you wanted more than this extremely short vague thing
you must have wanted a scene for scene yeah review of the film as if there's no middle ground which
yeah there's no middle ground if i if i thought that the idea that you went in and on your third
viewing you said you weren't bored and i think that wasn't all that much and so your takeaway
from that is that i needed a scene for scene review of the film i swear seriously if you
watched a new film and i was like what do you think and all you told me was you went bored i'd be like
fucking go on that means the feeling is probably bad
saying i was not bored sounds like criticism it's like well i wasn't bored yeah it's like well i
mean what can i say i i wasn't bored make it to mauler this video is a very valued take and five
hours of detail is highly commendable but no one is entitled to that level of he thinks i'm entitled
to that he thinks that i'm entitled to mauler level reviews and this fuck off like this garbage
video i don't know how he extrapolated that from you that you were like i demand a mauler level
analysis from i hate everything it's like shit because if it's it's either a three word review
or it's mauler level there is nothing in between to give you an example because i'm subscribed to
i hate everything still and he released a video very recently like a couple days ago yeah
the quest for the best where he reviews five films in 27 minutes so let's break that up uh
what's what's 27 divided by five it's about five let's say about five minutes of film with some
intro and outro so he says more in those five minutes per film than he does in this entire 17
minute i think it was video for the last jedi rags his criticism is not that he did not uh speak
about what he wanted it was that he's wasting fucking time in this whole video yeah what if
you're trying to defend a film and you say on my third viewing i wasn't bored that isn't that's not
good he actually uses some arguments i'm not gonna say soon let's say eventually later i never he said
he he actually references real things that happen and says why they're good that's what we call
substance versus saying i wasn't bored okay hopefully we're clear on that now it's like a
child went into see star wars and wrote this down and then the third time i wasn't bored you're like
carlton you need to be more specific okay and he's like but i wasn't bored but i don't want to
make a five hour review i didn't i didn't say it it is just a selfless blessing and on top of that
some people don't want that sort of content we just okay stop with this tangent that's not what
rags are saying you don't want a world you're more than some just one quarter let me reference
me again as if rags was asking for five hours i hear a quick rundown and whether you want to
hear it or not other people i love how you've already referenced you watched what was it like
30 videos and some of them are gonna be like five minutes yeah which is shorter shorter than
i hate everything just want to hear someone casually expressing their opinions people are
criticizing what isn't there how is i'm sorry i wasn't bored is that like a is that a really
interesting opinion to to get across to people like genuinely it's subjective sure but what is
your take tiaro on someone saying i wasn't bored if you make a video and your defense of the film
because you're kind of starting to get into actually defending the film sort of and you
start off by saying kind of what you felt and stuff like that and so you say i watched it three times
first off that would give a lot of people reasonably the impression that you have some
you know you really know the film inside and out you saw it three times that's a lot that's
more than i've seen the film but i would also expect more than at the end of the third viewing
of this whole film i wasn't bored yeah and that's what it comes back to and you reasonably
think that that's a little lacking he's pushing this to like places where they talk about fucking
putting words you're putting words in i ate everything's mouth like what are you doing
jesus rather than what it's from an idealistic standpoint is all about once as she oh and yeah
so to clarify the sentence was i genuinely had a good time and i was never bored it's so it's not
just saying he wasn't bored but uh yeah it was another there was another meaningless thing
attached to it yes well yeah had a good time is like sure again this is so what i would call
placid it's just like but even then that doesn't have anything to do with the film's quality
i mean like that's why you can watch the room and have a good time again that would just be
questioning what what is supposed to be eating overall isn't it quality what what do you yeah
what exactly what part of quality are you looking for doomed expectation and this is something that
we'll talk about later with regards to the last Jedi i went into this video expecting i ate
everything to talk about the film at hand with some good production value and intriguing opinions
i got what i expected sure he plays me i didn't i was just as much a fan of him as you were tiara
on the response but the response was still relative to the last Jedi and the midsection
was still filled with his thoughts on it so i can't really complain on that behalf as a general
premise you draw these expectations from previous videos from the youtuber and videos as a concept
youtube is i don't need to know what kind of videos he makes to point out that what he says
in a video is lacking not only that what is tiara saying here it's like rags you have a standard
and just because he didn't reach that standard that does not mean that you should criticize
yeah i mean like my standard is not exactly high yeah i was gonna say now just i just wanted
something talk about something substantive that's it that's all rags wants yeah someone said are you
are we being told how to properly watch youtube now different people ih you may speak more about
the nitpicks but that doesn't make his points invalid especially as he acknowledges them as
nitpicks i don't think rags said his yeah thing was invalid he might do later on but he certainly
hasn't said it so far yeah he never declares there to be no reasonable criticism of the film
his implication is that there is a disproportionately high amount of people overreacting to
yes and he lumps in the people who are being very reasonable and calm in with the people who are
threatening death like that's that's the whole point that rags is making and this whole thing
is a fucking non sequitur exactly what has this got to do with what we were just covering
yeah this is just like words pictures things like this star wars films there may be reasons
that explain that mentality but it doesn't necessarily mean that there are reasons that
make that mentality right and ih is not inherently wrong to criticize it i'm not saying since when
did rice i'm not saying you're wrong to criticize it saying that it's wrong to criticize isn't the
same as your criticism specifically can be wrong also stop referencing this screenshot
this screenshot does not help you yeah stop using it uh incorrect in bud my standards aren't
high for this purpose right here obviously if i'm gonna like give me my standards for everything
aren't low but sometimes with like a youtube video my standards will be lower than you know
who i'm gonna marry or something like that everybody has different standards for everything
obviously gommerad muskovich is your platform to be angry that he's chosen to address that
it moves towards his puritan narrative but we say really really we're going okay i'm just gonna
ignore that one he should be doing rather than how well we're doing it and if he had implied that
we were somehow going to get something that we subsequently didn't then there may be cause for
complaint but he never this is an insane over analyzation of things that were never said
yeah like i feel like we're being forced to repeat ourselves because it's the same shit uh yeah like
rags did not say i hate everything was supposed to do x and he did why rags is criticizing what
i had everything put forward yeah i never said anything really about what i i'm not really
specific a lot of times about what i want because it's almost like what what you want oftentimes
is kind of like um a good analogy would be like you're at a buffet you don't know exactly how
much you're going to eat so you don't know exactly how much to put on the plate but once you've had
enough you know you're there yeah they gave you any promises this is just his opinion you're not
entitled to too much else it's just rags opinion yeah i don't think that his his three micro reviews
if you could call him that i thought they were hilarious because of how bad they were and how
much they didn't help his point that's where i'm at with those i feel like if tro if none of this
had happened and tro was just watching that video with me and i like pointed that out i feel like
he'd just agree he'd be like yeah that i don't know why he just said that that was weird but
like because this has been built up as a sort of war between these content creators it's like he's
having to defend even the stupidest stuff like if you guys ever catch me saying and you know what
i went to see venom for a third time and i wasn't bored in my review of venom i just feel like you
can ask me why i threw that in there and i could be like oh shit yeah i probably should have gotten
that out in a redraft because it just doesn't add anything to anything but again it's just his
opinion rags so you can't criticize him but then this is just your opinion so tro can't criticize
you but then that's just his opinion so we can't criticize his video i guess it just goes on forever
i guess we have to close the stream down especially when his feelings are based on
initial viewings you complain that his responses on his viewings are too casual but many people
don't yeah but this isn't this is i hate everything we're talking about we made a video when he like
edited it and he uploaded it and it was a time after it's like he's not actually walking out of
the theater here he's made it he made a youtube video come out of first viewings immediately with
notes taken he's expressing what he felt at the time because that's a part of his stuff okay i
don't care if other people enjoy it it was really not that good for his video it didn't help again
that's not really what rags was saying rags didn't say nobody enjoyed i hate everything's video
why would he but not every film is better on the second viewing and it's not a widely accepted
view as i h e says the second viewing i had a much better time it's widely accepted that
the film is a lot better the second time is it oh it's such a stupid myth and i swear it got
propagated just to give the fucking film more sales like what was it what is it the you know
like this film's like the prestige even ex machina there's a couple of others where um
watching it a second time allows you to understand more about the narrative or what's what's occurring
let's say even though it's a very Welsh saying uh what about the last Jedi makes more sense or
congeals better after a second viewing and i'm not saying that it's impossible to enjoy it more in
second viewing that's not what i'm saying i'm saying what what can you reference in the film
that functions better after you see it for the second time rather than the first yeah like if
you're trying to convince somebody that it is better on a second viewing what would you use
to convince somebody of that oh is is that a widely accepted thing i i had no idea honestly
but then somehow goes on to imply that i actually was somehow being dishonest as people who go and
watch it a second time must be only people who really like it i mean i would imagine that if
people realize that's a perfectly reasonable conclusion the people who are seeing it for a
second time probably liked it already yeah that is a very reasonable thing why would i go and pay
to see it again if i hated it like oh yeah of course it's like that's fucking common sense
if you hate the film why would you pay again especially without expensive movies are
to see it again to go through an experience that you hated plus fuck this loud ass music
really didn't like it at all they wouldn't go and pay to see it a second time the only people who
would see it multiple times are probably people who really liked it but okay i guess which is
weird considering i h e has said he just wanted a more concise view on his feelings of the film yeah
but he said that he liked it after his first viewing he said it's commonly accepted that the
film is better on a second viewing which is bullshit because it comes from people who probably
liked it already do you understand this point and remember i h e said he liked it after his
first viewing i h e said that i'm going by what he said did you not listen to the words coming out
of my car and there was no reason to contradict that statement whatsoever other than an attempt
to present him as he literally did say that i'm going by what he said tro this video is awful
why aren't you listening mood more biased than he actually is so we can rain down heavier criticism
on i h e ranks then disputes it was completely fair criticism from my perspective but there we
i h e's point that the last jedi isn't a remake of the empire by referencing an article that notes
it's similar plot points in both the last jedi and the empire strikes back we follow our heroes
on a single ship on the run through space from the empire first order's most powerful capital
ships meanwhile luke and rey are off on remote planets learning the ways of the force from jedi
masters who are pretty cagey about taking on new pupils at first both points are what comprise a
film i'm sorry is he playing your video alongside speaking was that what was just happening so we
have the loud ass music we have me talking and video talking over me oh like let's just get that
from an editing standpoint is like oof let's just get that i had a joy i paused i was like rags you
talking over the video nope then also you know also um i think in i h e's video he said that
there wasn't he said that there were similarities made between the last jedi plot and the plot of
the empire strikes back he said that wasn't true and so i just googled it yeah because there is
yeah there's a lot of visual references as well um the the like i think i said it on the stream
we did all the way back went about star wars where i was annoyed that when they go through
like the crystal cave bit and it's all like oh it's so close oh will they make it it's a complete
redo of the final run in uh return of the jedi and they play the same music as well and i was
like so it's it's blatant then they're doing the same thing and that's that's one of the
vega references the ones you're referencing are pretty much just one for one yeah i just
went to the nerdest is like you can explain this thing and it's the same scenes pupils at first
both viewpoints are what comprise a film alone and we can't believe he's got music his voice
on your voice at the same time what the fuck it's yeah i don't know man get better people edit
your stuff would agree that there were some similar matches that ran slightly too close
i certainly wouldn't say that it can be induced that the film was just a quote remake of the
other on wait did you say it was a remake of empire would you say it has i can't remember
but you know based on and plus he cut me off like i keep going like i'm with the similarities
like he didn't let he didn't let my thing finish because i keep going on and on from this article
about all the ways that they're similar he didn't let that play out probably because it would make
me look right we don't we don't need that getting in the way rags friends was in fact praising the
movie as staying true to the original themes i'm responding to criticism that it's too
hang on a minute the staying true to a theme literally ripping seeds and plot is the two
different things we could argue that the theme is the same in episodes four five and six but
they're not the same films yeah i mean look if you're trying to convince somebody that these
like if there there are two opposing sides of the argument that these two films are similar
in their structure yes or no and i come out saying all right here's a scene by scene comparison that
i found that i'm just going to give you the list from nerdist.com happens and this happens and this
happens in this and it has side by side pictures of the scenes and explanations and you're like oh
yeah well that's not everything dude look at the chat i realize how much themes is a trigger word
for our audiences themes well what different rags even acknowledge is that these i need to
pee i'll be right back talk about everyone in chat discuss themes beautiful wonderful themes that's
uh that's like three times rags going to toilet i haven't done it once yeah it looks like the
bladder power is over in britain compared to america that is confirmation should we talk about
the theme of bladders guys i feel like if you made a movie it was really bad but you had the theme
of blattery blood Icarus it's like a spell no i feel like that would save the movie personally
ripping off equals themes my themes narrative triplets
i love predators themes of weaponizing autism yeah see
they are different themes but they didn't even steal the same scenes
which is cringy more just right fans or disney marie su defenders uh i don't know you can get
all kinds of cringe on both elements including this probably cringy people in our own fan bases
you never know i'm here all right here we go roger is similar i mean the structure so we can't hold
this pee well i'm actually doing um in less than a month i'm going to the grand canyon to do a
room-to-room hike and so the i'm drinking a shit ton of water because it helps you prepare for the
elevation because i live in arkansas and we are not very high up and the grand canyon is very high up
well that explains the plot hole yeah everyone's like you must have a shit ton of water the bladder
of an like the size of an acorn and that just doesn't like like i'm telling you i i drink water
like a fish but um there you go it's good for you drink water my pee is like it comes in clear it
goes out clear man that's how it is beautiful but isn't this i yeah i've had that when you drink
shit tons of water it's just like wait like i don't even know if i need to flush or not that's the
thing yeah probably safe to just just give it the old flush you know just just in fact praise in the
movie are staying true to the original themes i'm responding to criticism that it's too different
rags even acknowledges that the structure is so it stays true to the original themes and it has
i think we're gonna have to go back because i'm lost already can ray are off on remote planets
learning the ways of the force from jedi masters who are pretty cagey about taking on new pupils at
first both luke points aren't what comprise a film alone and although i would agree that there
were some similar nash plot points don't comprise a film alone what rags is describing is the plot
this is a pretty titanic bit of a film is the plot and the chase that takes care of basically
everything up to crate and crate is a rip off of hoth and then luke story is a rip off of yoda's
that is the entire film except for canto bite
oh also them on the stomach supremacy or whatever it's pretty it's pretty tough to listen to all
that and be like yeah they weren't also yeah that's really cheap i'm gonna say it that's really
cheap uh rags goes on to basically throw out the entire story being a rip from the the article
and tiaros cut him off to say just taking up what points doesn't comprise a film
yeah for the first time he does like a fade out effect like he i could go i'd go on and on but he
doesn't let me the theme of plot which is around slightly too close i certainly wouldn't say that
the film was just a quote remake of the other he says a quote remake did you say remake because
obviously the last jedi isn't a complete remake because it's not a complete remake but shit man
that plot is really really skipping over the same beats and doing the same thing they're clearly
dancing to the same tune here on top of this the article he referenced was in fact praising the
movie as staying true to the original that doesn't matter if it was praising or castigating it
that would be like about me saying canto bites terrible listen to this account of it and you
see the account and then it turns out that was a part of a video where they said the film is great
apart from canto bite yeah it's like this doesn't matter whether you think it's good or not very odd
point to make themes i'm responding to criticism that it's too different rags even acknowledges
that the structure is similar i mean the structure is really really really similar but
the film doesn't require just structure to qualify as a remake but i'm still current did you say it
was a remake i can't i don't know it was months and months ago this entirely relies on the fact
that you just said that it's similar instead of saying it's exactly the same means to me you
probably didn't say it was a remake i mean it's really really really besides i don't know it feels
a little bit like pedantic to be like it's not a complete remake unless it's literally everything
is the same it's like of course no film is going to be the you know like uh psycho got remade in 2001
i think from 1960 something and it's a shot for shot remake but it still has stuff that's different
in it you know like there's there's a scene where something slightly different happens like like see
not a remake because it's not entirely the same i would be interested like at this point like
what really is the big differences between the two other than like just general competence
and like i don't know in microcosm this just seems to be you pointing out
that i hate everything is wrong to say that it's not ripping from the original
but if i ate everything's point was originally it's not a complete remake it would be like
well yeah but even then i could be like yeah but it's close oh it's close
like way to way to shove off criticism like you know force awakens it's not a complete remake of
episode four but everyone accepts that it's a complete fucking remake of episode four you know
what i mean yeah then there's just some pointless back and forth it says but at the very least you
have to admit this is something new for the franchise no one saw this story coming the
film gave us something different and rags takes advantage of the low hanging fruit to express his
disappointments with the film i mean people expected things to be done characters to be
expanded upon relationships to be made arcs to be developed rivalries to be fostered some cool
interesting information that maybe was a callback to something that we might have previously been
hinted about but no there was none of that and even if you hate the law that was low hanging fruit
that was low hanging fruit that's an that's an awfully that's not a very nice thing to say about
i hate everything yeah i was actually that was gonna be my first point outside of the fact that
i don't think it was low hanging fruit to actually refer to i hate everything's point as something
that's so easy to counter i don't know why mention how high this fruit is or not he said it
should i have ignored it also i don't know why he sped up your voice i guess because they did
comment on how they find your voice annoying to listen to at the beginning maybe that's what that
is i guess i don't know i don't know why that makes it any less annoying but it's weird that
you would bring up this point after saying well i mentioned those comments because they exist
so why does it matter how high the fruit is after all it exists it's a high claim there's
some more complaints from rags about how he hasn't spoken about the film yet for perspective we would
be four minutes into ih's video that's not a particularly long introduction segment for an
approximately 20 minute video it's just long when you interject in every fucking sentence
kind of like how you're doing right now yeah why is this supposed to yeah i didn't even agree with
him that you shouldn't interject but that's what he's doing i will interject whenever i have
something to say and first off why are you criticizing me for the film or for the video
that you wanted also implying that every not every sentence is important that he scripts and he's
like this is some of the shitty sentences you don't need to respond to them but yeah this is
silly coming from tro he's very usually meticulous especially with this video so don't yeah this was
very bad this rags is then annoyed that i h explained his cinema experience rather than a
formal review all right you said you were gonna talk no stop reframing what rags is doing it's
really getting tiresome it's like rags you're just upset that he's not doing exactly what you
want to do it's like no i hate everything opened with saying the response to the last jedi has been
what he's a malicious and overly simplistic and then references a bunch of people with legitimate
points in that little screenshot and then ties everyone together in it and then says he wasn't
bored while watching it it's it's an awful video
talk about your thoughts about the movie but you said so little what do you expect for us to take
away in spite of the fact that we're around four and a half minutes in and he will later embellish
these narratives so my question stands yeah the question stands the question stands like what are
we supposed to take away by from what you just said and he's he's qualified it as an intro that
four minutes what are we supposed to take nothing from an intro yeah why make him oh it'd be it's
just if he talked if he said something i mean normally when you say something you want people
to take something away from it so i'm like what did you want us to take away from what you said
clearly just your opinion there right i guess once again that's i h e's style i h e that it's
his style to say nothing it is introductions okay it's i i'd like to think i give i h e a little
more credit than trodas yeah and says i'd like to think people who genuinely hate star wars
wouldn't waste their time going to see it rags what the fuck why is it see it's immediately
like stop framing it like the people who hated it just hated it because they hate star wars that's
not and you could be like that's not what i had everything said you'd be like uh fine points out
this statement and seems to imply that this might contradict it but you clearly think that they did
based on what you said at the beginning of this video but it does not let's put the two sentences
together it comes across as if some people go into the movie expecting to hate it although
i would like to think the people who genuinely hate star wars wouldn't they're not contradictions
as they're both built on conditions i h e then expresses that he is a fan of movies first and a
fan of star wars secondly rags acknowledges this and expresses his own feelings on it well that
makes a little bit of sense i felt like ryan johnson was giving star wars the middle finger
seemingly positioning himself as a star wars fan first how is that putting myself as a star wars
fan first yeah no what rags is saying is that if you're a fan of films before star wars the last
jedi will be easier to consume yeah i have no idea how that is in any way a contradiction
yeah well he say that means that rags is a fan of star wars before uh films it's like no it's not
right to say that to say that ryan johnson treated the series disrespectfully means that i'm a star
wars fan before a movie fan that doesn't make any sense i h e then says i think this perspective is
important because i feel like i and many others are looking at this movie in a totally different
lens to a lot of other people and rags strawman's this on the basis of his earlier statements about
how i h e must have only liked the pretty visuals and nothing else you wanted to see pretty graphics
and it has star wars in it so it must be good i don't know the context of that so i i can't
say either way uh legitimate with him with him talking and stuff i don't know where one video
begins and one doesn't and if the two things are together that's the thing like that's why i like
my format so much better because it's so much more simple oh yeah just play video respond play
video respond but uh what i got from that is i hate everything says i went into this film with
a particular lens and then implying that's why he didn't hate it like compared to other people
and then you respond with oh yeah the lens of you want to see pretty visuals and blah blah blah blah
okay gotcha like it's obviously you're being coy again because you're implying that his point is
kind of worthless he said it would be like this film is being hated by people but if i go into it
i don't hate it because i'm looking at it through a particular lens it's like what even point you
making and you you filled in a blank that obviously you did i doubt if you would ask yourself in that
very moment did i hate everything say that he only likes it for the pretty visuals you'd be like
well no but it's like because it's universally pretty much agreed that things like the effects
and the cinematography are amazing across the spectrum yeah and those aren't exactly um
controversial things to say at this point which her in is the problem with this video self-awareness
he criticizes you for not giving i had everything enough benefit the doubt and putting things in his
mouth etc and it's like you're doing the exact same thing to rags yeah that's the thing i'm like
some people comments are in the in the chatter saying is like i don't it's hard to get a context
of what i'm saying to what because the editing is so confusingly done yeah i mean it's hard to tell
remember like the line his defenses have included i hate everything is being um hyperbolic he's
joking or he said uh what was the one uh sympathetic or something something to do with feelings
that's the one so sentimental joking and hyperbolic he's used those as defenses for
i had everything so how can we not apply them to everything you're saying
you were being hyperbolic in your response to him just then deliberately that's that would be
my assessment so i'm curious how tro would be able basically he sells as much benefit of the doubt to
i hate everything as he can and he takes as much as he can away from you clearly that's not me it's
pretty clear who's side who's on but we should know that because and i can i can see why the
right opinion have a hand to play in ihe's video yeah which is a video if you are a true star wars
fan you'd hate what this movie did i see so many comments exclaim yeah it's silly for people on
the internet to decide who and who isn't a true fan of something which once again rax question why
is this music so loud and what the hell is the tone of it like done done done yeah it's really
i'm not saying that's that's not an argument that he's wrong who isn't that's not an argument that's
wrong shit sorry there you go it's not i'm not saying it's an argument he's wrong i'm saying
this is annoying editing stop whoever edited this part stop leave for people on the internet to
decide who and who isn't a true fan of something again why are you finding these comments well by
what by what standard yeah obviously you fucking idiot if they're there it's because he chose to
put him there fucking stupid idiot as if rags is disputing that like yes i'm just yes i i couldn't
have figured out the right opinion i couldn't have figured out that the reason they're in your video
is because you put them in your video yeah fucking brilliant analysis it's not what i'm asking they
exist rags a doctored screenshot you know that video i released randomly of just a corpse rotting
on the road they're like why did you release that it exists because i decided to it exists
i uploaded the video that's why ah it's just not an argument it feels like rags is annoyed at having
to agree with him so he has to take issue even when there isn't one he no because this is a
repeat of before rags is commenting again on how i hate everything brings in these extremely
hyperbolic and stupid comments to respond to and then also be like negative response you see
negative response is ridiculous it's like no yes jeez and the the idea that you can
is that you can unironically say it's there because he decided to put them there no fucking
shit sherlock he then states which you yourself try to paint as irrelevant and not worthy of your
time when from my perspective it was just a joke there you go again it's oh well if he's okay well
if he is joking i wish i could joke i wish i wish rags would get that benefit yeah it would be nice
if rags got that every once in a while but never mind then claims even though you address these
kinds of things so much in this video instead of the actual critic yeah and rags is right he
simultaneously puts look how look how irrelevant this comment is he's put negative four million
votes on it then he's also saying this is everywhere this is the thing we need to respond to
yes like is he saying by putting negative four hundred thousand or whatever he's saying that
nobody agrees with it nobody ever would agree with it and how minuscule and pointless it is
like he himself through this edit he made is saying that it's ridiculous and it shouldn't
have attention paid to it but he's paying it so much attention and i'm like yeah when's the
criticism of like the film gonna start like you're gonna say anything that like matters or this
as if his video which is initiating discussion on a general topic and highlighting the toxicity of
debates is meant to address every single last criticism rags once again seems to think that
these comments no rags just wanted you to address the reasonable ones the ones with merit he made
that very clear he said the word merit fuck you as if rags wants you to fucking respond to every
single criticism that ever existed about this film i want you yeah obviously obviously i don't want
you to spend all of your time talking about this silly ridiculous comments that you yourself believe
are so silly and ridiculous you edit them to look so comments are either uncommon or non-existent
rags then says it's avoiding things that should be talked about you are clearly avoiding things
that should be talked about it's star wars not a fucking missile crisis who are you to decide what
should and should not be talked about depends on the context if you want to yes absolutely if you're
going to say let's talk about the quality of the last jedi okay well there's some subjects we
should cover and it's like who the fuck are you to say who someone should talk well you should talk
about like isn't it i would maybe i'm giving people like tro the the benefit of the doubt
maybe giving i'm giving them too much credit by thinking that we can come together and decide
what is valid criticism or not you know like some nobody on the internet with no subs who made a
comment months ago that hasn't gotten any attention exactly that doesn't have any substance to it
is that yeah can i think nor most people can agree that we can ignore that and instead move to things
like videos that talk about the plot issues or the character issues or the pacing issues or
the editing mistakes i guess i gave too much credit someone just said the guys lie he should
be responding to everything since they exist yeah that's true they do exist we'll talk about a film
more in depth then go and watch another video you can't dictate what their topic should be you can
discuss their execution all you want but there is a difference he has never declared this as an
in-depth review not i'm not gonna have to declare it when he's talking about the quality of the film
yeah what is this nonsense as well it's like he's just sharing his feelings rags you can't
criticize that oh this is like an obsession with uh the idea that rags just wants something specific
from the video when he can't stop highlighting uh the need for substantive arguments that's what
rags is actually doing also i think he's gone for something a sec who are you to choose who's
relative in this discussion but they exist do we exist does this chat exist oh tro t ro
it's a very misguided video like um it would be interesting to see how this video would have
looked if i was able to just talk to him for half an hour before it that's this all that would have
been required to dissolve most of this because i don't know why i don't know why you'd want to
choose this video from i had everything to defend as well it's just such this is a bad one this is
a bad one and everything the way he defends it he does on his channel is a review and not everyone
who has subscribed is subscribed for the reviews it's not what rags said anyway yeah i don't care
why people are subscribed to whatever anybody i don't it doesn't matter looking at recent releases
hunt down the framing was just a discussion youtube in the news that's not this is not relevant i don't
care about any of that stuff he's like rags is demanding things from the channel assuming stuff
based on this other video it's like no rags has already made it clear he's only seen this video
so i don't know what you're doing here as a thought piece the only things that are always actual views
are his search for the worst series and even then he doesn't discuss every element this channel
doesn't take doesn't counter anything rag said these topics too seriously the title suggests
that it's i ate everything and he talks about the last jedi that's pretty much what you got
i'm not expecting him i'm not expecting him to expect me to like it
it's ridiculous why why this long tangent that doesn't mean anything rags said he should talk
about specific things to do with the film the criticisms if he's going to be making statements
about the the film's quality and this is the thing like we've gone over plenty of this video
to imply that i hate everything is doing an assessment of sorts and we've already covered
as well he said that the people in that screenshot were being malicious and overly simple and it's
like you're not even addressing their arguments if you're going to say that they're overly simple
fucking address their arguments and explain how i would love to have some arguments about this
film be presented man instead of just shitting on all these people and then being like it's his
video rags he can do as he wishes god whether you like it or not if he presented this as an
in-depth critique maybe your qualms would be more just about as if as if he did that you'd still be
making this fucking video yeah you reach right but i beckon you to find where he premised that
rags then talks about this brand movie distinction in response to ihg's facetious claim that no one
hates star wars more than star wars fans referencing mauler's theory i guess it is true
that no one quite hates star wars as much as star wars fans mauler who i spoke of earlier
wrapped up his trilogy of criticism videos on the last jedi with this message it seems very
appropriate here ultimately star wars as a movie made people fall in love with a fictional world
and its characters as a byproduct they fell in love with a brand that brand lives on today
and now star wars as a brand is making people fall in love with the movies in a most shallow
and empty way it doesn't matter what it is anymore just as long as it's called star wars
which as a theory must i say is a damn interesting one but a theory nonetheless unless you present
oh jesus he wants me to he wants you to present irrefutable evidence that people
like star wars for shallow reasons in relation to the franchise being made into products and
merchandising go for it rags make that video man it's why don't you just take the theory and
like talk tell me what you think about it give me something give me instead of saying well unless
you can prove it empirically you're not gonna maybe he will say something about it but if he
doesn't i'm like man that's just so dismissive b however it doesn't seem particularly relevant
from my point of view as i said i do not think that ih is in love with the brand from what has
been witnessed and it being used in this way just he kind of admitted that to me and wolf he said
that he likes the film in spite of its poor quality that must be related to his love for star wars
it's like there you go yep yeah it's like one of those yeah straight from my eight everything's
mouth tro you are wrong well he's quinton says something later on like um if maula was to speak
to i ate everything all he would say is that's an interesting perspective you have that's your
opinion it's like but that's not what even happened when we had our conversations to get
fucked yeah it's like you guys just say wrong this stuff is wrong it's just not correct you say a
thing and it's like nope we've got it straight from the horse's mouth here you're just wrong
to gaslight his opinions before they've even been stated then ih uses a mark hamill quote
it's only a movie and if you think you're going to go into the movie and recapture your childhood
you're setting yourself up for disappointment which once again is summing up the message of
his video the sort of don't take it too seriously guys yeah that's an interesting take it's a very
interesting take when i when i saw that clip from mark hamill after seeing the film i was like oh
oh that's what that meant this poor broken man this poor poor man to take that as you know
you're just gonna take some risk gonna be an interesting film it's like hmm rax responds this
with an onslaught of mark hamill interviews where he expressed doubt oh you're gonna bring mark hamill
into this exactly man you're gonna bring mark hamill into it all right let's play some other
clips shall we yeah maybe this is like this is pretty uh this is pretty rough if you're gonna
bring up mark hamill in his opinions all right let's get into mark hamill in his opinions exactly
before you bow down to disney okay
no one can hear this nobody can fucking hear this shit what's the point in speeding up to
the point where you can't even hear it here's the thing i'm gonna give you some advice
so this right here is bullshit what you do in this video right now if you're gonna play something
then you play it to where it can be understood because if you don't that's slimy shit you
understand if you're gonna play stuff he might not have entered this though i know but he proved
he approved it no that you're right you're right about that yeah uh i'm more commenting
on how interesting that dynamic is it's like he doesn't even have control over the clips that
have even played well we assume maybe it's in the script maybe it's in the script a lot of
f's in the chat i'm guessing they're for mark hamill yeah um i'm telling you look if you're
gonna put this stuff in your video i don't it's it's just not it's it doesn't give the good
impression to the viewer that you're doing this from a good place i mean at least it's the one
one time but genuinely like let's let's just give this a small rewind can you understand this
no no idea
what's the fucking point in playing you may as well played one clip
clearly instead of well you might as well have just censored my video
because he can't understand him you're playing the clip but you sped it up to a point where
people can't understand what he's saying so as a result these are points that i'm this is
a point that i am making in my video this is a point that's supposed to have like substance
and merit to it as a response to ih e bringing up mark hamill and you're just going to play it
in your video where people can't hear my side that's scummy dude yeah i'm not sure i wouldn't
do that i think i wouldn't do that someone else like you could do it in your videos if you really
want to but i wouldn't do that to somebody else i think the goal here is going to be that he's
going to be like look at all these clips he's played in mark hamill fine but look at these
clips like everyone always uses the counter that mark has now said that the film is good
so if that's what he's going to do at least that has some form of design behind it but it's still
pretty shit to skip past these like why even show them if you're going to do this
oh man this is that's a great clip he says that it doesn't matter if the movie is good as long as
it makes money i know that clip but he just fucking skipped it yeah i know that clip too
remember kids if you get into hollywood it doesn't matter how good it is or what the quality is
well the only thing that matters is that if it makes money yeah and he's fucking
odd topic about transformers and comparing it to the force awakens which that's pretty heavy
coming from mark hamill someone saying that this is narrative tripling is when you triple the speed
and listen hamill's character missed the mark for me on premise however most of these interviews
followed through with context that hamill was actually quite happy with the final product
and that he did accept it you know prove it he didn't he didn't have a chance he had to accept
it that wasn't his decision to make whether he accepted it or not and besides the context that
i remember from a lot of those clips is he'll end it by saying but you know this is not luke's
story this is not my movie this is ryan's movie and i've there's even a clip where he says this
is i'm 100% ryan's movie so if it's good it's his fault if it's bad it's also his fault and the
thing is if you're gonna say that right after playing the clips but we can't understand them
i mean how much more of an impact would it have had if you could actually hear mark hamill in my
clips and then the right opinion said oh but he loves the film it's great yeah and talk about
effectiveness for editing you show the clip the rag shows then you go but how did that clip end
and you drag it from its source and show that immediately after mark goes but the film is
amazing and you'd be like why did you clip that out rags that would be something but what he did
here i don't even i'm not even following really like this is like oh man this is like scummy
narrative tripping like i look i'm i'm saying i you could make your videos however you want them
but i would never do this to somebody else and maybe that's the difference between you and me
the right opinion maybe that's the big difference between you and me you put more music in your
videos rags loud music and play someone else talking when you talk jesus even if he initially
objected to it and i think development of such is very interesting so to frame it is just hamill
unequivocally hating it is kind of undermining the actual no rag said it's interesting you're
playing some clips from mark hamill let's play some other ones i don't know if did you say mark
hamill hates the last jedi did you say that definitively i can't remember i don't know it's
even if you like choose between if i had to choose between he hates it or he loves it i'd say yeah he
hates it same but i suppose it's we can just say we're being hyperbolic can't we yeah we're being
hyperbolic tiaro in fact we're joking or uh we're being sentimental yeah one of those complexity in
his thoughts the interviews with him are very interesting we wouldn't know we we wouldn't know
because we couldn't hear him oh you know we got a new editor in part edited by happy craft tv like
the part coming up or the part that no idea dude i don't know well let me give you some editing
advice clarify that please ask if it's a mistake that you even if you said this part edited is
like you mean the upcoming part or is this part of the part displayed someone's brought up in
chat and again we did bring it up it could be the fault of the editors but it's like that's
you can't do that you have to accept that you're still responsible for the video
yeah it's on your channel if i let somebody edit my video and there's like full frontal nudity
halfway through it then i'm responsible because i didn't because i approved it yeah he must have
approved the video we have to assume that youtube search box fills to mark camel hates the last
jedi do you think it is a mistake for youtube's algorithm to go ahead and auto fill mark hamill
camel hates the last jedi but the search box is much more based on popular demand what people
think rather than what mark hamill thinks himself i don't think rag said that's what mark hamill
this that was based on what he thinks you just you just highlighted it's a very interesting thing
yeah yeah i'm basically saying this is a very interesting thing because there ain't one for
mark hamill loves the last jedi which makes you think hmm why are so many people interested in
mark hamill not loving the last jedi in the whole interviews that i've seen he genuinely seems
passionate about the movie and i think him stating his apprehensions just makes it seem more real and
it's a shame that he's had to apologize for something that he shouldn't apologize for well
at least we agree on that i mean you shouldn't have had to apologize for seeing the film betrays
jedi and luke yeah i'm all for that yeah i'll link lots of interviews in the description below
which have him expressing everything good to bad it's honestly really cool to see him be so upfront
and although i agree with rags that he is a gem i would not say that he hates it on top of that i
would not look that deeply into the clip that i hg plays other than to reflect the message
of i hg's video rather hard that's the problem i hate everything was like see we should listen
to mark hamill don't take it so seriously it's like should we also listen to mark hamill when
he says that it's like really bad for all these different reasons or should we ignore those bits
because those bits get in the way i don't know even the fact that mark hamill so conflicted
i mean even that in and of itself is like cause for concern or at least i think it should oh yeah
dude this clip where he like puts his head in his hand and he like shakes a bit that's a
fucking broken ass man and it's sad because everybody claps when he says that we're supposed
to ignore the fans it's like what the fuck is happening harmlessly it's not that deep
then rags turns i hg's narrative on him he encourages i hg to tell mark hamill what i hg
tells rags and those who dislike the film that a he's taking it too seriously we're taking it too
seriously i don't i don't get a context of this yeah talk about framing like i'm not is this what
rags says i i don't know what i'm responding to why couldn't show it i'm i'm legitimately
confused as to what he's saying here i'm going to assume that what you said this is the complete
assumption here i'm going to assume what you said was hey i hate everything why don't you tell mark
that he's taking the film too seriously when he says that you know luke is being completely
ruined or the the jedi as a whole above allah and i think that's relatively reasonable because
rags in this video is running with the the conclusion that the people i hate everything
is talking about are people like the screenshot i had everything showed where they're like i'm so
disappointed in this film it ruined x y and z it's like mark hamill has said similar things okay
do you understand how rags got from a to b to c because it makes sense to me
but apparently this is a complete jump and a reframing of of the reality again and that's
me assuming what happens in your video from from what i'm getting from this it's a very
very oddly edited i rewound it about 13 seconds so let's take a look turns ihc's narrative on him
encourages ihc to tell mark hamill what ihc tells rags and those who dislike the film that
a he's taking it too seriously we're taking it too seriously b he's nitpicking we're nitpicking c
he went in expecting to hate it or we just went in wanting to hate it and d that he should shut up
and enjoy the spectacle why can't you just shut up mark and enjoy the spectacle
easily argued that rags is being hyperbolic yeah obviously yeah i'm trying to i think what i'm
because the editing is very unusual here with way he phrases it you'd think that if he used
the script he'd be a lot more clear and concise it's normally the point yeah i find it fascinating
that he describes what you said and then like shows very quick clips instead of just playing
rags's clip entirely yeah um i think what i was doing because i haven't watched the video since
um i think what i was saying was why can't you apply the reasons that mark didn't like the movie
to the reasons that you gave to everyone else yeah i think that's what i was saying and that's
what i mean it's like a question it's a exploration if you will it's like hey i had everything would
you say this same stuff to mark hamill after what he said i think that i think that is what i said
and yeah it's interesting and he's like look at rags reframing it as if he's saying all of these
things to people like mark hamill who are simply sharing their opinion it's like whoa yeah i think
it's supposed to make me clearer and more concise same thing with a script so yeah and i stand by
if that's what i yeah i just stand by what i said i mean because i think that's a really
interesting point to make would you tell mark hamill after he said the things that he said not
that the right opinion showed that well he showed it but we couldn't understand him which is in and
of itself showed it for people who slow the fucking video down to 0.25 yeah it's why you
why is that not a um a good thing to explore because i think that's an interesting question
to ask yeah same you know if you can say it to us why can't you say it to him but unfortunately
view rags he's played a clip of a person looking confused or uncomfortable at what you said so get
fucked okay he's got okay game over there is a curbed fury to these lines that would provoke
a viewer however rags has employed a few tricks which i don't oh oh rags is employing tricks
that is interesting okay they get done out of naivety in this instance firstly he loads his
statement with the presupposition that i h is not again you're exploring hugely into rags just
commenting on how interesting it would be to turn i had everything's responses onto mark hamill
yeah it really it's really simple like he's gonna over analyze this like crazy so let's see how much
of this we can get through it was super simple i'm hoping it doesn't really need much exploration
yeah i was gonna say i'm hoping we can get through like a good half a minute or more with just
this is all going to be over analyzing what you said he's been telling him and those who
dislike the film the following statements which as we've addressed is not the case he's
addressing the toxic side of the debate yeah no we've addressed that that's not the case he's
shown screenshots of reasonable people too tiaro you showed it in your video several times you
need to watch the videos then gradually escalates each statement to the point that none of these
things are remotely applicable beyond the first one the one that mark hamill was saying himself
anyway and the last one being out not that we'd know we couldn't hear him right ridiculous he has
not once said that he should shut up and enjoy the spectacle do you think rags was saying that
i hate everything was saying that when he just says it wow that's a bit of a stretch that's a
bit of a jump there tiaro this is uh oh that's a bit of a reach this is what i mean he's he's
guilty of everything he's accusing you of like it's very strange our critics often do that though
does it take this long to make this kind of video and fuck up this much yeah it's very strange
because all i all i'm asking is you know wouldn't it be interesting you know would you would you
say to him what you basically say of everyone else that's all that's all i'm saying there's
no trick there's no trick no he said it was a trick and he showed a guy looking uncomfortable
at you you're done rags leave youtube what a joke rags then some you just said what a joke
about about your i'm sorry this is getting uh very just self-awardous levels have plummeted
to negative billions at this point yeah surprises his thoughts on a conceptual basis before pointing
us towards more as more in-depth video i will say that with the utmost confidence of all of the
criticisms reviews and commentaries that i've watched within the last two months span that
star wars the last jedi is one of the worst constructed films i have ever seen even though
it might not have been obvious right off the bat once more i cannot stress enough how informative
and in-depth the criticisms made by mauler are of this film there are so many if it took him four
and a half five hours to talk about them all there is no way i could possibly and realistically do
them just okay and there you go okay i mean that sounds pretty fucking straightforward to me i'm
like man there's so many criticisms i couldn't even begin to touch them but here's where you
can hear them that's not gonna be good enough though i think we're nearly there to where i
start getting lambasted instead of you so it's gonna be fun and plus i said that this was one of
the worst films i've ever seen how could he possibly say i'm wrong if that's what he's going
to say but i'm curious to value arguments media can be bad in subjective ways but it can be bad
in objective ways that can be measured discussed and explained and you can quote me on this because
i stand by it 110 percent the last jedi is an objectively poorly made film yes yes the objective
value audience was originally hypothesized in mauler's con hypothesis people keep saying
i've invented it i'm not the inventor of the idea of assessing something without emotional
influence that's not something i made okay it's ridiculous i absolutely stand by it yeah
yeah there's some pretty serious fucking objective issues with the last jedi and it's like mauler's
hypothesized that you could objectively judge i was like no so if rags can bring in a friend
so can i and let me tell you all right we're about to start the quinton section and a model
suggests i should try and get through a few of the super chairs to keep up with them let me use the
let me use the lu you do that okay um let uh let's see where we are
narrative tripling leonard church here saying sorry to bother rags on discord when he's gaming
i'm sure he's he's he's okay with that uh narrative tripling is when you listen to three
audiobooks at once which is kind of what we did in this uh do you guys like anime if so what are
your some of your favorites my favorite anime is fma brotherhood and one punch man they're my
favorites from what i have seen so you guys talked about yen and siri being cast what are your
thoughts wolf has said that he's very upset about basically all the casting of the witcher i'm
assuming that's related to the witcher uh could you guys upload the i hate everything debate and
just edit i hate everything out maybe get someone else to read his part he can't object if he's not
actually in it right i'm pretty sure he would object to that absolutely like he's not happy
to have it released at all uh what did wolf do to get banned from twitter again he called somebody a
retard i believe uh there may have been some other insults thrown and i think it was hate speech that
he got nuked for in more like can you do a video analysis on the series zombie milfs 3 the squirting
dead i i i'm gonna refrain from that one because i'm busy with star wars um i'm poor and can't donate
as much as i'd like but i really like to support what you do and have watched all your content
more what are your thoughts on sick hero you're gonna have to wait until it comes out uh it looks
interesting and if my like i'll be doing work on the tfa critique i think but if enough friends
recommend it then i'll probably jump on especially after seeing some more gameplay trailers but uh
thank you for uh support uh for the lore holds that is better than 10 guilty persons escape
than one innocent suffer from sir w blackstone moolah argumentation please i think that's in
relation to cabinar i'm assuming uh pumpkins it came out way before but um i agree yeah it's
better that we live in a system where the the the legal system isn't okay with innocent people being
incarcerated well it's it's kind of why i stand on a negative on the death penalty because i hate the
idea of innocent people getting murdered by the government because of laws they didn't even break
like that's fucked up what i my opinion on that is that i think there are crimes that are worthy
of the death penalty the problem is being that sure yes it's tough stuff um and it's just it's
not because i'm pretty sure there are a whole bunch of people who have been killed uh wrongly
on death row right like there's a whole history of it oh i'm sure i'm absolutely certain uh response
to a response to a response gotta go moolah have you seen the thanos vid with you yes and i'm
probably going to play that on the next efap because we can't i was going to do it on this one
but i was like this one's going to be way too long anyway what do you think of plinkett's criticisms
of it making no sense for there to be different sized lightsabers would a 16 foot tall creature
have a large lightsaber if so how would a fight be fair i mean it's probably just a he's probably
right i don't know if the films are ever going to go into the depth of how they construct lightsabers
the whole the whole point of a fight is that it's unfair in your favor um how dare tiara misuse
monokuma's theme this way i don't even know what monokuma is after watching your h bomb a guy
response i got inspired to play through all the souls games finished the trilogy bloodborne and
i'm working on neo ever tried neo thoughts rags wolf um i need to play neo have you played it rags
neo i have not played neo i've heard it's good though we will get to it uh eventually because
i've heard a lot of good things about it i watched this stream three times and was never bored
i'm so glad efap is a thing it's sated by desire for good podcasts it's the drunken peasants
breakup last year we wolf has actually mentioned we've got a lot of comments comparing us to the
drunken peasants it's quite interesting because it's really yeah it's i guess the format's similar
but the thing is like the drunken peasants would cover at least like a good four or five videos in
one two hour stream and obviously i'm not saying that they should do what we do but i was going to
say like ours is very different to that so we've gone for four hours but ours is very content rich
you could say it's very dense i guess we play content and try to create content at the same
time but um thank you because i you know i find the drunken peasants was quite entertaining um
sort of say that we're similar to them and that they were a good podcast thank you
yoda rejects luke because of his age going back to jedi council rules while luke just
rejects ray because kylo well yeah i mean understanding luke's perspective about jedi
and stuff in the last jedi is confusing as hell i would never expect someone with an aggressive
name like i hate everything to be such a bitch well maybe he wouldn't call himself that if he
was to rename it today i suppose i just want to say the last jedi battles are tiny compared to
real war single planet and the leaders don't seem to understand the cost of war compare them to real
battles and you'll see there's there's quite a few uh youtube videos that assess it from a
military perspective that are quite interesting um they're they don't come up in the last jedi's
favor let's put it that way i just want to give them the thing is too with um the last jedi it's
really tough to get a sense of scale of this conflict yeah i think it's really a failing of
the film i mean it's confusing as hell they have like the biggest enemy force in the history of
star wars and then also they're like wiped out in one move and you're like oh wow but then they're
also still a huge force to be dealt with um also they have a dreadnought that's one of several
according to lair it's you have no idea what this the stakes or scale is of everything really um i
just want to give mark hamill a big hug and say it's not your fault we're all there with you bad
um hello doggo wanted to become patron for a while but you know the saying shit happens
anyway keep up the awesome work i'm assuming that's directed at you rags well i appreciate
the sentiment either way i'm convinced that hamill's change in tone in his tweets that disney
came to him and said we can easily make your death look like an accident fucking hell uh we'll never
know for sure um i stand by the fact that i think mark hamill felt bad that he was being referenced
and used as a sort of linchpin in arguments and he was like no i just want to i just wanted to say
what i thought about the film i didn't want to cause you know that sort of thing but again i
don't know anything about what goes behind on behind doors in disney so who knows uh rags he
probably just what he just wanted to be unifying i think that's just the kind of person he is rags
given fallout 76 a try at all i don't know honestly i don't know maybe but um i don't
know what i've seen so far is that it looks like a fallout for dlc and he said wait my previous
donation not go through let me have a look for the black flame uh i read the one that you said
you wanted to recommend gundam iron-blooded orphans i don't know if there's any others i've missed
i'm afraid i'm pretty sure that's everybody in which case let's continue this is the reveal of the
well before we do uh the right opinion said will rags brought in a friend he's like no i just
mentioned someone who's yeah i'm not actually a guest of the video yeah i was like hey i'm just
gonna reference this guy you should watch his videos they're really great on this movie
so if i know you're gonna love who i'm about to introduce someone who although i disagree with
fairly clearly on the last july which disclaimer we're gonna disagree with in this following
section i consider a friend nonetheless who's always helped me out and involved me with his
writing process let's bring him in
hi i'm quinn reviews and this is a copy of citizen cane
oh my god i'm so sorry
okay some anyone want to guess what that's supposed to mean
um because i haven't seen this um uh i guess he guess he he doesn't
care about good films my only guess is that he thinks that there are people out there like me
and you who consider it sacrilegious to criticize citizen cane that's all i can get from that
assumption yeah because it's i don't exactly know what he's um actually i don't know
i i'm gonna need i don't know what he means yeah i was this is about to jump into the rabbit hole
with this maybe he doesn't like that movie for some reason a months ago i reviewed the last jedi on
my own channel and basically said that i thoroughly enjoyed it yeah we couldn't even finish it we
covered it on wolf's podcast we died after about five minutes i think that video quinton that
video was fucking dog shit really was awful i would feel ashamed if i had ever produced a video
like that you should delete it i'm not even rags go for it no mercy with uh with the shit quinton
comes up with soon after this i received a barrage of strangely personal comments from
people who hated the movie and more importantly hated people who liked the movie you see how
horrible these people are they hate you for liking stuff there's no one out there who will hate you
for not liking it that doesn't happen but you know what does happen if you like something
people hate you and that's wrong just just yeah because i've been i've been unironically called
fascist nazi white supremacist sexist bigoted for not liking the last jedi
yeah well that doesn't happen it only happens on this end of the aisle and that's why he's
justified in whatever choice he makes next and in response to this i decided to make a parody
video making fun of some of those a parody video that went down horrifically badly because nobody
understood what the hell you were trying to do with it is that video is still up uh he's
unlisted it but you can't access it oh that aged well yeah that aged well this is the thing he
he fucked it up half of his audience actually thought that he was giving good criticisms
to the citizen citizen cane there was comments like finally someone criticizes this shitty film
it was like uh oh that's not what his intention was his point as he explained on his video before
he had listed it because of how badly it went was supposed to be that you can always spin a narrative
like you can always convince an audience that a film is x or y through a video
and technically speaking he was right but none of his audience fucking understood it they were like
is this supposed to be criticizing mauler is this supposed to criticize the film is this parody
are you serious and it was just he just unlisted it because he had to explain it
over and over again it's just it's the biggest tell of whether or not a parody fails is when
people are just like don't know if it's parody what what is this that's why we can discuss to
this day whether l3 is a parody or not yeah because they fucked up the tone of it completely
references to the work of mauler i was then invited to a debate with mauler and random
yep i i said that his video was cheap but i'm happy to talk about the film with him
in preparation for this i decided to watch all five hours of his last jedi criticism video
and i found that experience to be heavily disagreeable not something that i found
any relation to whatsoever nothing in the entire five hours none of it shit all right damn okay
and the thing is i'm not sure that that's inherently that much of a bad thing
whether or not you agree with what i said isn't really a bad thing yeah i'm fine yeah i guess i
guess you know like it's whether or not it's a bad thing i don't know it that i would that would be
something i just wanted to elaborate on what do you mean a bad thing like that's the thing where
it's like bad they're very yeah i need them to develop that a little bit just what do you mean
by bad a review is nothing more than a description of an experience no it's not uh no um if i tell you
that uh i don't know star wars released in 1977 directed by george lucas starring mark hamill
harrison ford and carrie fisher and then someone says that's just your experience
and i'm like no well and that's a part of you there's no way you can well if you made a review
of star wars and all you did was it made me feel this and it made me feel this and it made me feel
this and that's my review yeah that's not it's not a review you can it's a review of your feelings
it's not a review of the film and to give you an example phone reviews typically go into all of the
technological aspects and most of it is undeniable he'll be like this is a blah blah blah blah
megapixel camera that's about functionality yeah what can it do how fast is it and don't tell me
a phone isn't a piece of art don't go there i'm not in the mood people phones and cars aren't art
it's fucking stupid yeah quinn's quinn's just wrong here when he says this well i mean
let's just for the sake of it it worked before right rags when we just look at the word so
define review go on google what do you got a formal assessment of something with the intention
of instituting change if necessary a critical appraisal of a book play or film published in a
newspaper or magazine assess something formally with the intention of instituting change if
necessary write a critical appraisal it's like you you we've got four definitions oh well two
definitions mainly here and he said it's like one specific thing it's just like let's be honest
review is just you you assess something basically mr soup in the comment said gotta love how rags
responds to bits of it instead of watching the whole thing what do you think we've been doing
for the last fucking like two and a half three hours how i never understand these people if me
and rags watched the one hour and 56 live and then we responded to it for like a half an hour
it would be almost just random thoughts like oh remember the bit where you said this
that's kind of how i feel about that as if we go through it slowly we can not only point out
patterns to you guys but we can actually address every point they make yeah and besides all of my
videos i watch the whole thing yeah i mean i mean i mean the whole thing's there like do you want
us that's the thing do you do they expect us to watch two hours worth of something and then just
talk out of memory of what we just experienced yeah i review what he said a review is simply a
description of an experience i believe i disagree he says it's it's describing how you felt
and i found that experience to be heavily disagreeable not something that i found any
relation to whatsoever and the thing is i'm not sure that that's inherently that much of a bad
thing a review is nothing more than a description of an experience no it's not this dates back all
the way to when a review spoke of plays and concerts instead of dvds and blu-rays and with
that doesn't assist your point at all yeah that doesn't help that doesn't help mate
this case it's only natural that from person to person the descriptions of these experiences
are going to be different yes all right but there's a part of that where they get so different
they're not useful yeah and have five reviews of something and they're all completely different
then you're like well yeah what what yeah how much real use can this be if there's no consistency
if there's no real way to tell that these reviews were about the same thing or described
in some way the same thing then that is going to have an impact on their usefulness
art is not a science there is no means to universally or factually prove worth
and arguably that is why art has any value in the first place so yeah this is just
he disagrees with objectivity versus objectivity but he's just blatantly wrong it's and i
everything disagrees with him by the way um it's it's an odd way to use the process of science
generally science doesn't isn't what we use to you know dissect the subjective you know if you
want to know something objectively you use the scientific process exactly and i think people get
very antsy about that they're like oh god you're talking about judging art as a science that's
antithetical to art yes science science is a process okay and that's the thing it's like no
no no we're not saying you can't get the point of like oh you know this is how it made me feel
it's that it's a separate conversation man it's almost as if they take what we say and say
they're trying to say you can judge feelings objectively it's like no you judge feelings and
you judge objectively those are two different things yeah you can have the you can have the
feeling and having the feeling can be objective because you can have the feeling regardless of
anyone's opinion on it but that's a different conversation there are different aspects that
you look at things and and conflating one with the other can you can maybe give someone the
impression that we mean things we don't and again check the definitions for these value has a
definition it's pretty much by by how a standard is satisfied right so then you're like okay so
what's a standard it's like a standard could be established in many different ways for example
what constitutes a planet and then you complete the standard and then you assess the fact that
pluto is always not a planet that's science by the way that's that's an actual science and for
you to be like yeah but that was a standard just created by people so it's not a definitive standard
you'd be like fine and this is what i got tro to agree with assessing art objectively is no more
accurate to reality than science is no more or no less so i'm happy to agree with that if that's how
quinton feels about it but i doubt it since he thinks that you can only get a value from art
subjectively there is nothing about the the technical standard in which it was it achieves
consistency or structure in any way shape or form if if you paint if you if you make a line if you
make a straight line on a piece of paper right we can all agree that this is yeah this is this is a
line but technically it's a line segment you know it depends on how exact you want to be but
if everybody that's why a lot of conversations begin with let's define our terms so that when
we all say words we know what is being meant right because words don't have meaning so much as they
have shared understandings yeah which is what the dictionary is basically for basically yes
and uh to piggyback your point let's say we're all in a class where they say you need to draw a
straight line and everyone's drawing this line and it's like just off just off just off and some
guy uses a ruler and it's a perfect line and they've achieved the highest standard of that particular
artwork at that point and you could be like yeah but i don't care for straight lines that doesn't
make me feel anything you're like okay but objectively that is a straight line which means
it's achieved the highest point of that standard in this class it's like someone's someone's already
asked how do you improve at art if there are no standards exactly and that was one thing that
was really kind of depressing about listening to just right absolutely like what is the after this
discussion how do you justify your channel existing well you recently released the video
saying that the writing and uh in ready player one the thumbnail said it was bad it's like
oh you must mean subjectively yeah what do you mean bad but here lies the issue the right opinion
and i would not be discussing rags's video if the issue at hand was just that he doesn't like the
last jedi and other people do the problem is that his thesis statement is essentially that other
people are not allowed to disagree with his bullshit yeah i don't think rag said that but go
ahead show me a clip show me a clip quinton because his opinion is on a higher playing field
than yeah this is why clinton this is this is why quinton's a fucking scumbag yeah he's a piece of
shit yeah quinton's a piece of shit this is the kind of thing that the piece of shit does
people like quinton they don't seek to understand um it's not a they don't value the pursuit of
knowledge in the same way to just to say that to say that i to say that that's my thesis statement
is absolutely ridiculous to say that nobody's allowed to enjoy it is absolutely ridiculous
right so remember how at the beginning of all efaps you're like this will be fun because you
guys get to hear my my perspective which is on a higher playing field than everyone else's
oh yeah you say that all the time that's why i always start them out like that because i i know
that my opinion is the objective standard by which we judge quality and anything that deviates
from my opinion is on the spectrum of incorrect and yeah so for people who are like this is a
really long stream it's like yeah well this video gets worse as you progress so this is this is part
of the uh the shit that needed to be responded to in terms of just fuck you quinton stop telling
people that this is what we actually do when it's not this is um oh yeah oh yeah and write the video
someone pointed out in chat at the beginning of the fucking video that this is the response to
i say it's okay if you liked it exactly but that doesn't count so no that counts even though i
specifically say something quinton can come in with his big ass brain and its compensation beard
and his yellow teeth and say that there's some i what i really mean is something that's completely
opposite to something that i stated yeah it's pretty frustrating because this is the thing this
is the core of what you could call me in rags is like uh the way we assess in general so like this
isn't just art or this is like our day to day we'll break up uh what what things are happening versus
how people are feeling about the things you know information's really important and then how people
feel about it's really important and so to just say rags and mauler they go about their lives
thinking that they're better than everyone else because they have better uh playing fields in
which they have a bit it's just like fuck you man and i and i guess we'll have to keep restating
it over and over because people like quinton will keep taking it out of context or they'll
just make shit up like he does here in a malicious way it is really easy to get it but we'll keep
saying it over and over you can feel however you want about anything you can feel whatever you want
to feel about the last jedi or the predator or jurassic world or freaking mary poppins it doesn't
matter you can feel however you want and we can never take that away from you and you're not wrong
for feeling a certain way everyone else's or to put it like he likes to his opinions are objective
no no let's be let's be honest rags an opinion can be objective it is possible and yeah an
opinion he yeah it's true it's not the way he means but yes an opinion can be objective
but it is not objective because it is someone's opinion if i say in my opinion the sun is a star
is that objective or is that my feelings how does that work yes it can be both i it is my opinion
that two plus two equals four that's objectively true but it's objectively true through mathematics
it's not objectively true because you feel it because i feel that way exactly yeah and that can
be overlap the simple deconstruction you're not going to catch me and rags saying in my opinion
the last jedi has inconsistencies because it's it's provable we don't need to say it's our opinion
we can demonstrate this irregard sorry irregardless in the word regardless of what our opinion is
it's just that our opinion happened to line up to something that we can objectively show and
demonstrate but what he's what he's selling here is that me and rags will literally like watch a film
go i didn't really enjoy that that much and then he's like oh so it's objectively a bad film and
we'll be like what what i'm not following all right frent for instance there's a you know
the movie space mutiny i don't but go on yeah it's an old crappy b movie um it was in one of
the best of the worst episodes of red litter media okay there is a scene in that movie where a
character dies she's shot she's killed and there's an editing mistake in which she appears alive and
well in the next scene just doing her job right it's like there there there can be objective
errors in films see just right would have argued that there may be a reason for that in canon like
she's able to clone herself or something like that like that's that's why he said it's never
objective because it could always change and it's just like jesus christ mate by that logic nothing
on this earth is objective and i i made this argument to wolf i said that um our understanding
of gravity might not actually be as objective as we think it turns out there's a demon on the other
side of the universe casting a spell that maintains gravity it has nothing to do with laws of the
universe oh irregardless isn't the dictionary now okie dokie oh neat i still i'm i'm a bit of a
purist in that sense yeah like i tried to use literally to mean literally instead of figuratively
even though the dictionary approves yeah i don't care if the dictionary approves of using the word
literally in the opposite way that it actually means i don't care and if you say it's right
because the dictionary says that's an appeal to authority fallacy because the dictionaries are not
prescriptive or descriptive there you go well i mean i would still say it's uh they're not
incorrect if they're going by the dictionary standard but they're not helping because there's
there is no reason that literally started to mean figuratively as well other than people being
hyperbolic that's how that word changed was people trying to use it in a hyperbolic way which is
bizarre yes that's because that's because people's usages of a word change and then the dictionary
changes to reflect it yeah the dictionary is just as best they can do of displaying to you how a word
is commonly used and what it means lee brown guy asks if the right opinion offered to debate me
um i guess honestly i don't know i never saw it i'm not going to say that he didn't make it
but i never got an email or a discord message as far as i know there is a chance we'll be able to
get them to talk to each other maybe on the next defab for all we know but yeah maybe if he wants
to talk about it at all tro's talk about it at all tro and rags obviously have lives and have been
getting up to a lot of things in between this so and i let tro know we were doing this and he
didn't express any interest in actually discussing it beforehand so i'm sure he's it's fine but we
might be able to get something he's talked about taking his video down yeah he's entertained the
thought which is like if he wants to drop it fine but um you know whatever whatever he wants to do
was fine with me i got things to do i don't get bogged down with stuff like that quinton's still
a piece of shit though of course those those are just subjective and you can quote me on this
because i stand by it 110 the last jedi is an objectively poorly made film before moving any
what's wrong with that yeah and that was not what you said it was quinton that's yeah very
different and yeah absolutely and we have continually continuously sorry demonstrated
this over many efaps and other streams across many different channels
uh before words we have to acknowledge something which might not be inherently obvious if you don't
know a lot about these two youtubers that being that most of this video created by rags is in fact
paraphrasing a video made by his apparent best friend mauler thus hey am i you're i'm your best
friend oh i guess we're best we'll be a best forever thanks thanks dude say quinton announced
it publicly for you but hey i'll accept it i do also i have to be honest the way you said that
the way you said that was as if to imply it's like
bring it in his best friend to do it he's in league with mauler he's just mauler's puppet
like i mean at this point um we we like how how was our relationship at this point in time
because this video came out a while ago at this point we had had spoken maybe like i want to say
like three or four times something like that um we certainly didn't have efap i found your video
after the last jedi came out so it was late december yes oh well i released them in february
the beginning of february oh okay so it was at least so we had basically just met our relationship
with still budding yes but you were obviously we were best friends we weren't as ready to tie the
knot as we are now of course of course but you know just to fully understand what rags is even
trying to say about the last jedi pretty ironic coming from the video that cuts context constantly
in order to understand anything that's going on here we need to watch all the other videos that
came before twat and also what he's trying to say about the nature of opinions we are going to have
i haven't really said anything about the nature of opinions no because for some reason
these people find it abrasive when we say there's a difference between fucking opinions and facts
about art they find that disgusting they're like how could you say that there's it's weird too
because they'll be the ones to say that we think our opinions are facts and then when we say no no
those two things are different they'll be like triggered by it it's very strange it's like when
it this is a this is a thing i get from a lot of people it's bad when we do it but they do it all
the fucking time sample brief clips from mauler's equivalent video discussing the exact same points
well i hate to break this to you my precious audience but if you watch my other work
i am one of the people on the internet who will tell you and simultaneously argue to the death
that there is such a thing as objective value to content media can be bad in subjective ways but
it can be bad all right that is not how you make the possessive form of my name my name is not rag
my name is how do you fuck up a four letter name rag is video rag is video this video is is not
belonging to rag rags it is four goddamn letters jesus in objective ways that can be measured
discussed and explained star wars the last jedi is objectively bad content it is provable this
is factual you love the themes that's nice but the film is still horribly written meaning that
the value you have defined from the project itself is simply for you it is not measurable or provable
now this is very important what happened before this clip was me deconstructing the
themes of the last jedi for about 10 minutes or so i go over all the themes of uh learning through
failure um but like like learning from your own mistakes is just just that stuff that's all in
the movie and i break down how people will cite poe even though he makes every decision correctly
in the film it's just a matter of him not having the information he requires so it's
completely unfair like you can't apply that theme but then contradictively we see that holdo and page
tico both sacrifice themselves where we are told that it was a mistake for fin to do it right and
so what i what i what i conclude is what you get from the themes is subjective because the actual
provable consistency is broken so the film's attempt to say what it's saying is fucked right
so objectively it's inconsistent objectively it farts on itself objectively it's bad that's
what i mean by that word right like i make that very clear and then i conclude objective i think
that a lot of people um confuse objective with absolute truth in a sense yeah which is not what
objective means so just just to be clear objective means it's irrespective of people's opinions like
the opinion that you have about something doesn't alter it essentially it is it is what
it is regardless of how you feel does so when i say that uh something is objective it does not
mean it's irrefutable sun and and and whatever else being defined objectively by standards
the standards can change yes 20 years ago pluto was objectively was a planet not anymore dwarf
planet now it is objectively no longer a planet the earth was uh flat one day a while ago that
changed well that's not a that's not a good example no well it's what i'm saying is we do
what we can with all the information we have like with the information we had it may have been
an objective assessment to us to take what we have in terms of the information and conclude
that the earth was flat i'm not 100 sure on that one it's not as good as the pluto example obviously
well well the way to phrase it would be objectively the earth was an oblate spheroid
before we knew it so if people said the earth was flat they would be wrong now if two different
people had an opinion of the shape of the earth one of them could have the correct opinion but it
wouldn't be the defining factor in whether or not it was correct here's the thing it's all in the
words that are being used so values are important value is the degree to which a standard is
achieved objective is without influence or emotion therefore objective value is the standard
being achieved without influence from emotion do you understand like is that clear like i guess we
need to say this more often because yeah because i guess what a lot of other people say objective
they think that we're appealing to truth yeah yeah like in an absolute extent and depending
on who you ask it's impossible to even ascertain absolute truth but it's but we're talking about
objective in the sense of it isn't defined your opinion doesn't have anything to do with it
it doesn't change based on people's opinions so the takeaway here though is that i've got all
this context explaining my position on themes and how they're inconsistent and so my conclusion is
if you're arguing that the themes are what make this film great for you that has to be subjective
because if you view them without emotion they're inconsistent and they fall apart the film sends
mixed messages so it doesn't it doesn't function but but you can still enjoy them whatever themes
you want to pull from the movie have at it man if you enjoy it then you can enjoy it and quinton
seemed the whole video as he stated and guess what he's gonna leave out of his assessment here
all of the context yeah man that's that's rough that's the opposite if we refer to logic and
argumentation for something to be objective one conclusion can only be drawn you can derive
objective that's not true no it's not true you can have multiple objective conclusions you can
have multiple conclusions yes and they can conflict yes you can you can draw if something
is a binary proposition uh let's use theism as an example you can draw the conclusion that there is
god you can draw the conclusion that there is not a god objectively only one of those things is true
you're gonna piss off a fucking fab base again well here's the thing i haven't said which one's
true or not true rags has not said which one of those statements is the objective one but
if we can relate it to something uh maybe this a little bit less testy for a lot of people um
how do you how do you get an assessment of something that could have two conflicting
objective results um you can take sample sizes of of like places with policies and conclude that
the policy was uh the thing that that got the the place to where it is but then you could also have
that that policy did not work in another place so you've got two results then you'll be like well
now we need more information to to figure out which one of these is less or more accurate because
they're both still objective but one of them clearly lacks information and one of them doesn't
or something like that like there's so i think i think the theism argument really is a really
good one um i was just gonna say this an argument that doesn't um that can appeal to people who are
religious still well i'm not that's the thing i'm not appealing to either one well explaining how
this works logically yeah it's like if you a an intelligent person can come to the conclusion
that there's a god an intelligent person can come to the conclusion there's no god right sure but
that is a binary proposition either there is or there isn't both of those things cannot exist
which means objectively one of those things is true but you can reach both conclusions until
it's proven i mean um we talked about pedantry earlier but like uh the ongoing there's an ongoing
conversation about finn's knowledge of the hyper drive right this all began with the obvious uh
scene where he goes hyperdrive blah blah blah is impossible and then 10 minutes later he's like i
know where it is so we can get there so people highlight objectively speaking that's an
inconsistency and then someone throws in some extra information who's on the defensive side
they say no because fin knew about the room once they found out that there was a hyperdrive tracker
he knew where the rooms were because all of the hyperdrive trackers are powered by this one room
so he knew where the room was he didn't know that that was powering a hyperdrive tracker
and you're like okay both of those were objective is there more information it's like well go back
to the attacking side and you find out that um there's dialogue in the film where they say
every single a-class process including hyperdrive tracking has its own breaker meaning that that
breaker in the room that finn's talking about is specifically designed for the hyperdrive tracker
meaning he had to have known it was a part of the hyperdrive tracker so you see like the
conversation with more information went one way then the other way and then finally ends on the
other way and it's like is there any more information to this it happened with um
just right when we were talking about holdo i attacked he defended i attacked he defended
i attacked and he ran out of arguments and then i argued for him and then attacked myself again
because i was like steel manning the opposition and it ends the conversation always comes to an
end because you basically run out of information there's only so much information but you can
achieve all of it objectively yeah and there's a spectrum of your ability to justify what your
conclusion is up until the point where there's enough evidence that you can say okay we can
have all these you know we can take all this information from all these sources put it together
and boom we know objectively based on everything that regardless of whose opinion it is it doesn't
change what the facts are yeah because ultimately um you could have five facts that bring you to a
conclusion but if you're unaware that two of them even exist you have no capacity to know that they
exist and your objective it's still an objective conclusion it's just based on three pieces of
information instead of the full five yes because remember all objective facts exist as objective
facts this is why what they're not you know it this is why this objective like me and wolf can
argue over a film while both assessing objectively because one of us lacks information that's
probably going to be the case like i highlight to him remember that scene where this happens then
he goes oh shit right okay um so was that objectively pluto was never a planet it was
merely assessed incorrectly no pluto was objectively a planet it was based off of yeah
based off of uh the definition that we created for planet though uh as we decided to change the
definition that's what made it objectively not a planet yeah and besides it's only we only need to
prove that it can happen we've done that with several other arguments now so even if you even
if someone said that about pluto would be like okay so what about all the other things we said
but anyway moving on wait yeah yeah and you in some instances where there are few conditions
and you realize that you can account for them however with a film for a statement to be objective
you must have counted for every single premise in existence to the point where you can listen
to every argument and still what do you mean every premise in existence how about logic for a premise
he's making the argument that unless you you're basically unless you're omniscient you can
access you cannot uh assess objectively you cannot assess whether or not something's objective
yeah well i mean film's a finite so we don't have to and now we're we're starting to bleed into the
realm of philosophy regarding truth and knowledge yeah which i've i've always said if you can't
agree that facts are a thing like if you think there is no such thing as a fact objectively
like there is no idea of being able to assess anything free of bias like we can't just say
that we we exist you can't even say that maybe this is something i need to discuss more at length
with like steve mccray and those guys on the non sequitur show but there has to be a point
where you accept certain presuppositions about the world yeah if you don't believe that anything
is factual or unbiased then we can't have a discussion because obviously it's then we can't
have a discussion it's completely contradictive ideologies so there's no point in dying yeah
all the same conclusions there are some things about film that may be objective but if you're
making a general statement on whether it is good or bad i do not like to say that is impossible
but you're pushing the limits there so it's possible no um here it's important just because
something has not been proven to be um well he's just he's admitted it's theoretically possible
well we don't he doesn't even know that that's the thing we don't know if it's possible
to objectively assess a film well i'm talking about like no i'm i'm talking about something
a little bit different i'm talking about whether or not something is is possible at all you don't
even know if anything you could imagine is possible right for instance we don't know if
it's possible that there could be a god we don't even know it's possible that yeah so when people
say well it's possible if there's a god but we don't actually know that so if you're saying
it's important for the right opinion to understand that you can't just say things are possible without
demonstrating that they're possible i mean i'm still of the this wasn't a contradiction to what
we said well he just said still sits in with what we said yeah when i'm yeah i'm just i'm just
clarifying that because it's something that does need to i i feel that often gets um kind of skipped
over people assume that just because they can imagine it it's possible but don't you think
it's interesting though because he's we've got a tag team right now of him and quinton quinton's
not saying this at all he's saying it's absolutely not possible while tiaro's saying well i guess it's
possible he said at worst he said you're stretching but it's possible yeah that's the thing quinton
doesn't have the information necessary to determine whether or not a prepositions or sorry propositions
possible in all quinton doesn't have the capacity for a lot of it doesn't have the capacity for a
lot of things as we've already seen but you know we'll just add that to the pile yeah even mauler's
in-depth five-hour video does not begin to account for the numerous conditions opinions
and further perception you wouldn't know that tiaro you haven't watched them
you can't say anything about what's in those videos sorry and even responses to its individual
points the best this theory can do is pedestal the opinions of those who look quick calling
objectivity of fucking theory what does it even yes is everything a theory by that logic then yes
it is a theory you have no reason to believe something is possible or true unless you can
justify your belief in it all right because every time you say well this could have happened
there is also in your mind an equally plausible outcome in which it couldn't have happened
and so you begin this ridiculous regress into the infinite possibilities of what may or may not
happen and you have to draw the line somewhere and i draw the line at is there anything that
we've been given that would justify us believing that a proposition can or cannot happen to clarify
for people uh tiaro did not watch my videos he had quinton watched them and respond to them
because he's a star wars fan and tiaro is not um at least that's my if if i'm completely wrong
on that that might be possible but as far as i know tiaro did not see my videos whatsoever
look to be backed up your conclusion may be that it is bad but that is based on your premises and
different people have different premises if my premises without emotion then it would be
objective because that's what that weird means the robot remember the robot no i don't like
the robot i like that he said that though because again that falls in line with what we're
saying he's like it's only bad by your premise it's like our premise is to assess it with consistency
irrelevant of emotion so we agree tiaro i'm glad we got to that point and it's what even is good
and bad they're good and bad there's there's a shit ton of definitions but i usually try and
talk about specifics so to be inconsistent is bad because it's lazy or it's contradictive
or it's there's loads of ways you can use and i absolutely agree that i should try and avoid
saying bad instead of using words like um uh instead of saying bad as a whole bad script
writing bad acting bad blah blah blah and then you go to specifics of what makes bad acting what makes
blah blah and that's why my videos are so long i try and qualify all this stuff and when you have a
discussion with somebody you can say all right let's start this off by coming to agree so that
our opinions don't get in the way like if we we can agree on something for this for the purposes
of this conversation let's agree on what objective acting oh and by the way as someone just pointed
out in chat and several people have said to make the statement there's no such thing as like
objectivity uh in art that's that's an objective statement correct that is a statement that
requires evidence that is that's making a positive claim vague subjective concepts in themselves you
would have to put yourself on every single little spectrum pertaining to an individual and explain
why it is bad on that spectrum no i wouldn't i go with my singular premise you've done is
explain why it is bad on your spectrum even if you're your spe- it's not my spectrum it doesn't
belong to me it's a fucking stupid why do people assume that i've invented objectivity yeah no one
has ever been objective in analysis ever where do you think i got it from that i just invented it
like come on yeah me and rags just invented it on our own and then wolf also did and then we met
each other that's what happened i just got i just got fucking sick of people's feelings feelings are
gay who needs them your logic is valid you have not proved it to be tautologists and thus
he's referring to a tautology and most people don't know what that is which means saying it
is it helpful to your audience the right opinion tautology is useless restatement or saying the
same thing twice using different words yes nobody is going to know anything if you yeah
tautologists i suppose so but well no but does this does that fit in his his sentence structure
does that actually make sense i don't know he used facetious incorrectly earlier so let's let's
i just want to hear this again to see if you use tautologists correctly different people have
different premises different emphasis on topics and different standards what even is good and bad
they're vague subjective concepts in themselves you would have to put yourself on every single
little spectrum pertaining to an individual and explain why it is bad on that spectrum all you've
done is explain why it is bad on your spectrum even if your logic is valid you have not proved
it to be tautologists that doesn't make sense it doesn't make sense i'm sorry tro but this shouldn't
be happening you're supposed to be like a literature expert or whatever i'm just a dude
but that's not what tautologist means i think what he was probably going for is
like it doesn't make it toed irrefutable i think he might be referring to like tautology in the
sense of logic where it's a formula or assertion that's true in every possible interpretation
that's probably what he means which is probably what he means in that sense but here's the thing
if he means it in that sense that's sort of correct yes if you you want to have a tautology
so it's true in every possible interpretation but then that gets us in then people are saying
what's the nature of truth blah blah blah blah we gotta we gotta cut the line somewhere yeah in
symbolic logic that word means correct in all situations which yeah that's probably what he
meant so here's the thing you say that word in a video two percent five percent of your audience
is gonna know what that is i only know it because i happen to hang out with some people and they
talk about and i just use google and look for the definition and then re-listen to what they said
and still end up confused it's just like i would is uh like don't use words like that people most
people won't know what you're talking about and that's not objective so the question if something
isn't tautologist that it's not objective it's like you're gonna need to change the word that's not
to clarify again so the word that he was using it to mean was what again
um how can a tautology not be necessarily true um in logic tautology is defined as a logical truth
of the propositional calculus if your preferred semantics of logical truth is true in all possible
worlds then yes a tautology is true in all possible worlds and hence necessarily true
all we need to do is condense what he said down into the words you're using are too subjective
to be objective that's what he said in in that process of about 30 seconds um i don't um because
the word bad is too subjective it's too vague he did use the word vague at one point so and this
is the thing it's like um bad has a definition which means it is possible for me to be objective
depending on what i meant by bad and the first fucking definition of bad is of poor quality
and then you're like okay but that's not um objective because what does quality mean and
it's like quality is by which a standard is achieved and a tautology isn't even necessarily
useful because you could say something like all all ten-legged lizards have ten legs
that's tautologically correct but it's not really helpful or really all that meaningful
sure yeah i mean yeah no benefit of the doubt for me once again but they do that to us
infinitely literally look at the first definitions of all the words i use and you'll have your answer
not like in this scenario obviously i'm not going to do that every time because i'm not
i'm not a god with words
well you know what if you uh took us up on a debate or if you sat mauler on his debate then
you would have your answer but instead uh you ran like a bitch and you refused to have a discussion
with him so um if you really wanted to if you were true in your pursuit of knowledge
you know what does he mean he asks in this video when he could just ask mauler what he means
he's this curious to find out what we mean by objective value and yet he fucking shies away
from every chance at having a debate because he doesn't believe that objective value for
our exists it's like why even ask us then you twat what it means it's as we've just explained
how a standard is achieved irrelevant of emotion how is that for you yet to run out of fucking
insults late brown guy asked again i don't know if he asked me to debate uh if the right opinion
asked me to debate him i'm not saying he didn't i'm just saying i didn't see where he did he didn't
as far as i know he hasn't emailed me he certainly didn't contact you before he made his video
i know that yeah i haven't been as far as i know i have not been contacted and if he did it on
twitter that's the worst way to do it especially because i didn't have twitter for pretty much
almost and more importantly what are subjective values and why are you think subjective values
are it's all based on how you feel about a thing what it makes you feel jeez it's not hard why are
you making this seem like it's some kind of 40 chess game they based on or influenced by
personal feelings oh rags did you catch that well i forgot he says there's such a
fucking asshole just listen to that listen to 30 seconds of it objective so the question becomes
to molar and rags what are objective values and more importantly what are subjective values
and why are they factually worse well why are they factually worse what does that even
find me making your why are you making your finger quotes like that's something we've said
exactly that's not something we've ever said he's implying that we say that the subjective
take on things is factually worse than the objective take on things not something me and
rags have ever fucking said okay maybe um i mean the only way that you could spin that is to say
that um uh you can show factually that the subjective is not objective but i'm stretching
so hard to make it what he said make sense the fact that he said worse it grinds my gears to it
like i'm not putting objective above subjective i'm drawing the line between them it's like two
sides of the road man they're just going to different places but they exist together oh
and look there's a choice for me quinton there's a difference between objective value and subjective
value i know you understand that whether you enjoy something is irrelevant when we're talking about
measurable mechanics within films or games and their quality i was told you shy away from
conversation with your dissenting peers which i was and that i shouldn't hold my breath breathe
i needed oh wait is that breath that is breath right i'll hold my that's breathe i think that's
i don't know goes to show why i may have misspelled that but i still figured i would give it a shot
your excuse is pretty damn sheepish maybe next time i guess yeah i stand by that 100 he said the
reason he doesn't want to have a discussion with me is because he can't be asked to explain to me
that objective value doesn't exist in in oh yeah it's breathe explain through numerous comments
and in numerous videos objective values are things that are measurable discussable and provable and
subjective feelings are discussable no thing things aren't objective because they're
discussable you can discuss subjective things where are you getting these definitions from
why can't he show it why can't he fucking show it that quote he just showed was not what he just
said god damn it i think it's a thing is not objective because you can discuss it with somebody
that doesn't mean it's not objective are things like qualifier if you like the themes or if the
movie looks see that straw man right there i didn't say if you like the theme i was like you
can't claim the themes are an objective of objective consistency that the film thoughts
on their own themes like i said but he's he's now turned it into oh yeah maula said if you like the
themes that's just subjective it's like no i went through the themes i went through the themes
so how much value they had in terms of consistency besides it's already a meme on my fucking channel
like you see people saying it already rushing to the themes to defend your film it's just like man
are you like out of arguments is all you got you just say themes themes it's like it's the
equivalent of god works in mysterious ways themes it's good because that costs money and basically
anything that he would call an opinion everything what i thought we just went over how i thought he
said that our opinion we say that our opinions are objective so we wouldn't call that an opinion
would we i've never said that no of course we've never said any of this fucking shit but he just
keeps saying that we did but yeah take me out of context again go on quinn and basically anything
that he would call an opinion everything positive said about the film is either about the superficial
elements that take money to generate the film is visually stunning and yes do you yeah do you think
amazing graphics just fucking grow on trees this is the thing uh there are i'm not denying
the talent that is in these cgi artists that is in uh what i'm gonna conclude on here is that you
can't buy script writing quality like 90 of the time all the people who are being bought from
let's say this script writers in this chat room right now who would be better at doing this than
ryan johnson in terms of a consistent script that was respectful there's two in this podcast
and how how much do you think they'd be paid compared to ryan johnson it's gonna be a hell
of a lot less even though ryan johnson and it's just because of the name recognition and it's
like that's that's the issue you can buy cgi you can buy you can even go as far as buying good
acting and i'm not going to say that there's no good acting in the film but the the script you
can't buy a script most of the time like it's it's really hard to get a consistently good writer
yes i think i don't think it's very i don't think it's very controversial to say that the last jedi
looks very expensive and that's the thing you get a lot like black panther despite having a lot of
money the cgi was a mess but it depends on what they spent the money on but if the script was
great the cgi wouldn't have mattered it'd have been like oh well it's just a bit of a blemish like
leave alone obviously and nobody would be saying the cgi artist did terrible because we'd all
assume that they were just rushed because most cgi films will get the job done if they get the
money they're supposed to get like especially this is such a high profile movie like this and
this is the thing it's a very this is a very long subject to discuss and it's a very interesting
one but let's just skip right over it and say that rags and mauler just think that if you like
the visuals or the the acting or the themes that all of that has nothing to do with reality or
measurements or anything it's just like yeah that's that's what we said fine yeah yeah the way that
you feel about it is subjective he has money all the subjective arguments that stem from themes
to interpretations to feelings the vast majority of my points aren't about perspective we are
talking about facts and if you don't agree with them then it will be difficult to have discussions
in the future because this is precisely how one creates a scale and moves on from it if you think
the last jedi is great good luck ever calling other films bad and there you go i'm talking
about an objective scale so if i was to say that the last jedi is amazing and then i watch a film
that's exactly the same as last jedi but let's just say in the drastic park universe and i go it's
terrible for all of these reasons and then someone's like but all those things are in the
last jedi and you said that was great i'm like well uh and that's what we call an objective
contradiction that that is just a literal is hypocrisy you've you've got two separate standards
and it's it's usually based on a bias like for example i love star wars i don't love
jurassic park simple as that uh subjectively though you of course could hold those two positions
you could be like i love this film despite its flaws or i hate this film because of its flaws
because feelings don't have to be justified by facts precisely how they kind of work obviously
they can be influenced by facts but um i i thought i was pretty specific in that little bit i was
like i think so because i every once in a while go back and i'll watch him and i i don't really
i mean really when you get down to it it's not that controversial to say that some there are some
things that you could measure based on facts and regardless of how you feel about them the things
that are in the film are in the film there's a finite amount of things that are in that film it
doesn't go on infinitely yeah and i i just coming down to the simple version uh a character knowing
something that they shouldn't is bad in this film and then another film you're watching you go it's
good well you can't say that because you you've just created a standard back there so now you
you gotta you gotta stick with it you guys are avoiding the real questions would rags kiss
quinton on the cheek no i like my bear smart oh come on look at that cheek i hope that you can
understand why this perspective which might initially seem unimpeded the perspective that
we actually have or the one that you made up the one that you made up porton oh and described in
a flat nature is the base issue with all six hours of rags and maulers videos about the last
they're amazing like and subscribe
state that your opinions which mostly come down to things like thoughts about the lore
and nitpicks about dialogue thoughts about the law and nicks about dialogue
congratulations quinton you're the king of fucking straw bed that's beautiful amazing
fucking amazing and but remember this is coming from the same guy whose last jedi video said
if you take away the script the characters and the plot was it yeah yeah he said in his first
video for anybody in the audience who does not know he said if you ignore the stuff about the
characters the the story of the plot of the universe that the film is actually pretty good
that's paraphrasing i will completely admit it's paraphrasing but it's hilarious this is the same
mouth same guy incredible quinton you don't want to be caught on camera saying that it's pretty
so it can never be objective facts that yeah it's a full sentence in there yeah described
in a flat nature is the base issue with all six hours of rags and maulers videos about the last
jedi to state that your opinions which mostly come down to things like and to be fair most of my
video wasn't really so much about the last jedi as it was about the things that ihe said yeah about
things surrounding the last jedi as for my videos uh i had shit tons of criticism about what i would
say the entire points of the film a lot of the playoffs i was ripping into how they don't even
make sense which is very important you don't want your the biggest emotional impacts of the film
being based on completely illogical and unrealistic scenarios that's not gonna help it's not good
thoughts about the lore and nitpicks about dialogue are objective facts that can never
be disputed by well some of them it's almost not all yeah not all of our problems with the film
are objective when some people say when you say nitpick you usually mean it's valid but it's tiny
right that's usually what it means a lot of people yeah no when people say it's a nitpick
that's normally that's normally because they don't have an argument against it yeah it's like they're
saying yes you're right but it doesn't fucking matter if gandalf yes you stabbed me but it didn't
really hurt that much well i'm more i'm actually going to go for a genuine nitpick here like um
the sun was an inch higher in this scene compared to the scene before it also and that doesn't match
how a sun would move and you'd be like yes obviously that's because the film is not
filmed in the way that you're kind of implying that it would be and you'd be like that's true
but it doesn't fucking matter in the slightest thus it usually gets considered to be a nitpick
now he said that this stuff concerns nitpicks about the lore and then it's like but to say
that those are objective and it's like but didn't you just agree that they may be valid but they're
tiny but also they're not objective oh so yeah it's it's a strange amalgamation of what is and
isn't reasonable in terms of a criticism it's very strange i don't also i don't like the way
that he he paints every issue that we have as being objective also someone just said rags tiro
said you declined his invitation to the debate unless you were in his video is this true or not
that was false that is not true at all whoever told you that is uh giving you bad info my dude
yeah i don't i have no reference for that yeah i never i never declined his invitation on that um
on those grounds no objective facts that can never be disputed by anyone is ridiculous some
things are objective facts that can't be disputed by anyone you dip shit that's how literally reality
works like he says it like this this monstrous thing that we've come up with yeah like science
has been a thing for hundreds and hundreds of years like man yet you're gonna have to accept
that there are objective we have to agree on objective facts about and that's why we have
processes to get ourselves closer to that you think tro said that himself on his discord
well if tro said that then tro's fucking lying yeah i don't i don't remember that ever happening
and i've i've often been the um sort of mediary between them but pushing on so so why do you hate
quid does so much it's like why do you think man like look what he's saying about our shit
yeah i don't i don't recall ever saying that to um the right opinion that doesn't sound like
something i'd say no i didn't like your video and i hated the last jedi he will at least be
sensible enough to tell you that's just a difference of opinion oh wait that's the thing i was talking
about earlier hang on i disagreed with your video i didn't hang on gotta go back a little bit further
the objective facts that can never be disputed by anyone is ridiculous let us compare and contrast
if you go to i hate everything and you tell him i disagreed with your video i didn't like your video
and i hated the last jedi he will at least be sensible enough to tell you that's just a
difference of opinion yeah no um we went to well i had everything came to us we had the long
conversation and then he agreed that um uh that the film was of poor quality he didn't say oh
that's your opinion guys he was like oh wow yeah so uh rip that i suppose yeah and it's only natural
for the right thing all those things and the thing is like you could have been a part of that
conversation maybe you know like i would have been there if i wasn't like away from you know my house
also high five to this comment can you see it let's take a look yeah um yeah things are fair
to criticize the film for if you truly feel this is the first video of yours that i've disliked i'm
not going to defend the artists harassing other people because you were right about their
ridiculous behavior you only focused on the morons though where are the legitimate critiques and
reviews by competent creators there are real issues with this film and you only wanted to
respond to the spurgs no yeah i mean that's what i said let's see is his response basically
feel that way i feel how i feel and you feel how you feel get over what's but if you
that will feel how you feel you feel you feel get over it's like okay that's that makes i h e
work look worse that makes him look worse dude because he's ignoring the question he ignored
the criticism yeah you're only looking at morons yeah someone was asking him a legit question why
are you not really going over the the the problems with the film how come you're focusing on the
little spurgs who don't mean anything and he dodged the question he dismissed the question
hey you know oh okay if i if you want to make i h e look worse good job quinn or rags and tell
them that you disagree with their videos and that you actually loved the last jedi you will get
comments like we're gonna do this so just to clarify before whatever the fuck he's about to show
uh if someone told us they love the last jedi what would you say to that rags
if someone said they love the last jedi yeah oh i'd ask why um in context like i oh like i
if they were a friend of mine i'd be like sure go for it but if it's just like some random of going
i love the last jedi as i was walking past them so they'd be like that's great yeah i see those
all the time on like twitter and stuff sometimes like well i like the last jedi he's like okay
yeah it's fine i don't even like say anything but i i would be you know why i'm curious why
they liked it but you said you wouldn't tell them they're wrong
you're saying you wouldn't say that hey your feelings are invalid is that not something you
say no no i wouldn't uh i don't know if i trust you rags i'm gonna have to go with quinton on
this one you have to get into the definition of invalid oh yeah that's true no because that's
the vast majority of my points i'm making a voice effective we are talking about facts
i am seriously doubting your capacity to understand so you did a really bad british
voice and then a nasal american voice but that the comment he read was i doubt your ability to
assess quality is like okay well this is the thing i didn't say anything about what people's
this isn't a response to someone saying i love the last jedi this is a response to someone saying
the last jedi is a great film like a consistent film a well-written film that's what my response
to that would be but remember there are people who write articles on websites and all sorts of stuff
and they call people who did not like the last jedi russian bots trolls racist sexist fascist
white supremacists bigots xenophobes unironically like this is what they do so i don't want to hear
your bullshit boo hooing about well if i say this on the internet people might make mean comments
they might say that i don't really you have the ability to assess quality like like you're gonna
have to grow the fuck up you're just gonna have to grow the fuck up man points you're a big boy
quinton i mean i i mean i know it's a conversation beard he's reading my comment with the silly voice
rags and you're not taking him seriously how could you what the fuck man he's this is this is this is
slam dunking us right now we got no fucking chance you got silly voice rags we fucked you
will get comments like this the vast majority of my points are not about perspective we are talking
that's literally by design i say a thing for example just um last jedi opens with a space
battle your comments huh are these your comments this is something i've said um oh because he
doesn't he he doesn't say that what do you mean no he doesn't say that these comments are yours
oh he said you'll get responses like this he's probably going to end this with saying that was
from maula by the way which proves he's an asshole or something like that i guess we'll see
about facts i am seriously doubting your capacity to understand quality and of course my personal
favorite if you like the last jedi good luck calling other films bad but fuck you you've removed
the context again you've already shown this clip and they're going to do it for a third time now
removing the context again i'm so proud of you you're such a good little editor man quinton's
shit the vast majority of my points aren't about perspective we're talking about facts
i am seriously doubting your capacity to understand quality oh hey that was me that was you
yes uh to clarify rags is probably referring to objective quality rather than whether or not
it made you feel good because rags can't actually disprove your feelings i might have just been
insulting him oh yeah either way oh you know what you might have been hyperbolic or oh yeah
melancholic or vitriolic or sympathetic or macularzolic you never know maybe he's judging
you wrong that's how that works yeah i think i um that it's weird that before because i haven't
seen this part of the video so he says that comment and before i even know that comment is
me because we can't remember everything we've ever said i was like that one doesn't seem all that
bad no it was like oh it's me um yeah cinema sin senses of the in the chat hello there hello
we're ripping into someone else who's criticized us today it's amazing the last jedi is great by
the oh by the way by the way cinema sin cinema sin sins is way better than quinton ever because
if we said quinton we want you to hop into efap with us and talk about this quinton would say no
and you'd say yes yeah i mean anybody who's up to actually defend their claims and respond to
criticism you you get a plus in my book hello this thesis statement in my subjective and it's
because it's not our thesis statement it belongs to us he's just like i'm declaring that this is
the thesis statement it's like no i don't have a thesis statement i made one that's ridiculous
jeez what a what a fucking joke he's just he's just pulling it out of his asshole
this is their thesis statement oh okay i guess don't ask when he plays the same point three times
over completely isolated from everything before and after it that's how you know that he's just
destroyed us it's done he made a silly voice rags it's done fucked his opinion isn't oh are we
yeah we're inherently toxic to uh i don't know i guess reviews or film culture or we're talking
we have discussions with people we say that you can feel however you want and that's just fine to
feel however you want to feel um we can disagree with you on video quality and we can still be
friends we're not gonna block you or refuse debates based off of offhand information that
we don't have um gosh what else i mean we're just not i guess we are kind of sorry talk about like
i'm not gonna say it's a dog whistle but using the word toxic when you refer to us it feels like
you're aiming somewhere to me like yes i mean but absolutely not saying that's the case but
that word has been a little bit it's been poisoned a little bit right toxic like a lot of people
don't even want to use it anymore because it keeps getting used in specific environments
don't you um didn't doesn't quit and think you're racist uh i can't remember who thinks i'm racist
i can't remember if he said i'm racist a lot of people said i'm racist though
because i heard that one of the reasons he won't debate you is because he heard you were racist
that could genuinely can't remember if not then i'd take it back but i think that's the thing you
actually heard from what i heard from because i had a couple conversations with tro about quinton he
basically said quinton doesn't want to speak to me at all not just because of the fact that he'd
have to explain what objective means to me but he'd also want to he wants to avoid internet
drama is what he said which is the most videos like this yeah no right like he makes a parody
video of me and he makes this video and he says he wants to avoid drama by because discussing this
with me would cause drama right that's how that works someone s is rag racist of course he is why
punk this is why fucking apostrophes are important i am not rag i'm ragu rag is video come on there
is no consistency to when an opinion is or is not measurable and overall i'm sorry what you just
imply that we don't actually bring a standard to the table because that's pretty much the opposite
of what we do but hey really i mean if you want to talk about our standard really what i'd say
is like in a nutshell our standard is consistency yeah uh logic is the baseline for a lot of the
objective criticisms because logic does not care about feelings it never has never will um i i
would say that in one word if i had if i'd use a single word i mean consistency almost bad this
thesis statement in my what's with this fucking body language what's with this calling that your
thesis statement subjective opinion is like you had sick you had five hours of video and he pulled
out this one thing from the five hours and like yeah it's this is inherently toxic there is no
logic to how this is constructed there there's no logic to how this is constructed that's the only
thing we ever fucking talk about is how like the foundation of everything we do and we won't shut
up about it i get bored talking about it myself i put myself to sleep talking about it because
you talk about it so much this this podcast will be an example oh fucking hell there's no logic to
what me and rags talk about yeah we never have references and we never show contradictions
that's not what we do there's no consistency to win no consistency opinion is or is not measurable
and overall is just a measly post all right so it's it's you can measure things as a binary
without measuring them as a quantity like i like saying you can measure that something
is there or not without saying that it is x amount you know yeah okay good i just i've never
i've never had anything like that before we're dealing with what is essentially an alien at this
point rags that's why that's why it's like you're gonna have to start saying things that are just
fundamental and it'll be like a revolution to quinton i was like i've never had to explain
this to people and so it's kind of strange sometimes to think of the words is like if
i have to tell is like measuring the tree you know it was like you can tell if there's a tree
there or not without knowing how exactly tall yeah to clarify when me and rags are talking about
logic it's not just about logic according to our universe if they have their own rules in the
fiction of course like it's the film's universe yes yeah the consistency is probably rags is
right is probably a better word for it it's consistent within its own rules or the logic
of our universe which is it's portraying you know yeah that's why both star wars and the
imaginary of dr parnassus can both be analyzed with the same level of consistency because as
long as the film is consistent with itself we're good yeah like if you watch a film that's based
as in like our world and then someone gets shot in the head and survives we're sitting there like
we lack information for this why are they alive as like generally that kills people maybe he got
lucky or what door is he doing who win an opinion is or is not measurable and overall is just a
measly podium constructed by these two to insist to their audience that their opinions are universally
better than everyone else's well you're we've never said that we've never ever said that do you want
us to conclude on what you're doing quinton because uh it's going to be a little bit more
brutal we're considering how much of a dirty little shit you you've taken on us basically
yeah here's the thing like this is this speaks to your character quinton that's the difference
it's like this what you're doing right here this says a lot about who you are as a person
the kind of things that you're willing to like i would never be comfortable doing that to somebody
else i would never i'd never do that to somebody else and if i did i'd feel terrible for it and
i'd take it back me and rags project from a podium that our opinions should be accepted as fact
that's all we do that's all we do now i can say that you should accept my opinion as fact but then
i will go through the motions to prove it and you're probably talking about a specific one
right yeah like you're not talking about all of your opinions i think that two plus two is four
and i think you should accept that as fact because bring in the cart full of reasons because here's
two things and here's another two things and i count things and others four things so you see
we can demonstrate we can share you can corroborate evidence with other people absolutely this might
seem blunt or crude but the ultimate issue to me is that mauler and rags believe that they are part
of a battlefield fighting their holy and protected beliefs what socially they what the fuck are you
on about quinton what the fuck we're fighting a war for our beliefs okay i mean that's that seems
a little excessive but how are you not doing the exact same thing yeah um it's strange though
i mean yes i mean you fight for what you believe in you know thing but this i don't know why it's
a holy i don't know what say what's holy about it i mean maybe if you hoist up a principle as
if it's holy or if you believe it's sacrosanct in some way but what a strange way to phrase it
i mean yeah we we just want to make this look kind of insane i'm guessing that's what this is
like look at look at rags and mauler fighting their war for movie opinions makes us feel culty
oh absolutely that's that it's that's definitely the impression i'm getting this is why i hate his
fucking parts in this video because the tro stuff there's more of a discussion to be had with this
this is just this is just literal attacks it's like quinton you're not making a good script here
you're literally being a dick and that's about it how long after they're going we are up to five
hours and 20 minutes jesus believe that they're part of the battle let's keep going a little bit
longer because i'm eventually i'm just gonna have to call it yeah as soon as you conk out man we'll
we'll cut it off there like just let me know let's try to get through the let's try to get through the
quinton bit fighting their holy and protected beliefs probably referred to it as holy and
protected beliefs the sir holy tech i don't know what he says by protected beliefs
it's like i will attempt to protect my beliefs based off of evidence and you know logic
it's also important to remember that remember kids you don't choose what you believe ding
socially they use their flood flood thesis or flood thesis maybe that's an actual phrase
let me look that up yeah you go ahead look it up that's going in my fucking april fool's day video
flood thesis no this is about flood damage assessment and hydrology their flood thesis
i'll call it the holy flood flood thesis the holy flood thesis get me just a second is there
a tripling narrative involved in that i wonder last thing i couldn't find narrative tripling either
flood feces um next time i see my brother uh because he um he's like an english major
i'll ask him if he's ever heard of narrative tripling and flood thesis this let's hear it
because i can get him when he can't just google it i'll i'll ask him if those are things believe
that they are part of a battlefield fighting their holy and protected beliefs socially they
use their flood thesis to justify that quick what are you doing so fucking loud how the fuck
did tiaro approve this this is by the way what i sent as tiaro in terms of what he should be
deleting from the video because it just outright false so tiaro once this part gone well he agreed
he was like yeah well he he said to me and i can go back and get the quote if it gets contested
he said to me that there are some things that he's going to want to discuss but there are
absolutely certain parts that he's gonna have to delete like via being inaccurate yeah like
fuck what part what what isn't that a part of in his section i mean jeez like everything he said is
how did you approve this tiaro yeah man how when you listen to this were you like yeah this comes
this comes across as a well-adjusted individual he hasn't taken two normal dudes on the internet
and turned them into fucking like cultist warriors fighting for the last jedi to be considered bad
what the hell the fact that they believe themselves to be warriors you two are not warriors
none of us are warriors we are geeks online to talk well no well so you can't say that here's
the thing quinson you can't change how you frame things if in one sentence you're gonna say that
we're fighting a battle then you also can't say we're not warriors i mean it's either one or the
other man not to mention because in a sense we never said it he put the words in our mouth and
then told us we were wrong for saying it like yeah i mean okay if i wouldn't describe myself
as a warrior but i mean if you want to say yeah you're a warrior fighting a culture war i'm like
yeah i mean i understand what you mean yeah i mean because i i do see aspects of it as a culture war
which makes one a warrior by kind of by that definition but man i don't i don't say in like
a glorified way well this is the thing once again quinton can't show a fucking quote can he
yes like because we never said this this is not something we say he's like you people are these
things but you know what you're not these things it's like yeah that sums up this video a little
bit doesn't it or at least quid quid is fucking part of it about films stop acting like you are
warriors basically as someone who knows more about star wars than the right opinion it is going to
be my job in this video to disagree with some of rax's points about how telling is that statement
it's going to be my job to disagree okay it's not even kind of it's like that's kind of fucked up
like when you hear that statement the right opinion are you're not like sounds a little
that sounds like i'm kind of you know like he already has you know he's got a job to do for me
come on rags we've got to fight our holy war about star wars the lore all crusades are just
the universe etc not because there is any factual basis to the fact that he is 100
yeah you know you painted you painted us as bad people there's no factual basis to the fact that
he's 100 wrong okay you just say that who's he referring to is that me what's that you i think
it's you because he said it's my job to disagree with rags so you must be referring to you the lore
the universe etc not because there is any factual basis he is 100 wrong not that there's any factual
basis to the fact that he is wrong okay um that's useful i well now that you've agreed that there's
not factual evidence that i'm wrong um i'm so confused all right like should i like still be
here can i go now maybe maybe there's like another half to that statement that makes it
make more sense because what maybe i'm holding out hope for quinn is 100 wrong and not because he's
a bad person for having opinions that i disagree with but because i am basically having to prove
that his opinions are not universally measurable are not ultimately 100 provable and are certainly
not anything resembling of what no the same thing three times that you haven't said no yeah
not only did he say things that i've never said but he also said i have no way to factually prove
things that i have to prove because he starts off by saying at the beginning which is what we were
giggling at like there's i can't 100 factually prove this and then he says i have to prove this
okay i have written out what i think his his sentence is structured a little bit smaller
so he said i'm here to disagree with rags not that there's any factual basis to the fact that
he's wrong but because there are no objective truths about his opinions like that is essentially
what he said and also quinton has this problem of painting all of our opinions as objectively true
yeah which is not the case i i share my subjective perspective on star wars several times in my
assessment and i i signpost that because i like to let people know um yeah just just to clarify
that what that statement i just said condensed again basically as him saying i'm disagreeing with
him not because he's factually wrong but because he's factually wrong like he said there's not a
factual basis to the fact that you're wrong but because you're not objectively correct did you
get what i mean like he did not think about that statement because of how long it is he thought
that sounded right but that doesn't make sense so let let's give this one more listen because i
think this is one big ball of gobbledygook constructed by these two to insist to their
audience that their opinions are universally better than everyone else's this might seem blunt
or crude but the ultimate issue to me is this seems like a lie because believe that they are
part of a battlefield fighting their holy and protected beliefs socially they use their flawed
thesis to justify the fact that they believe themselves to be warriors you two are not warriors
none of us are warriors we are geeks online to talk about funny quinton we don't even disagree
with you there but films stop acting like you are warriors basically as someone who knows more about
star wars than the right opinion it is going to be my job in this video to disagree with some of
rax's points about star wars just this fucking music man i know right go through goddamn like
you are warriors basically as someone who knows more about star wars than the right opinion it
is going to be my job in this video to disagree with some of rax's points about star wars the lore
the universe etc not because there is any factual basis to the fact that he is 100% wrong and not
because he is a bad person for having opinions that i disagree with but because i am basically
having to prove that his opinions are not universally measurable he said did you catch it
yep so his sentence doesn't make any sense yes what his this is this is a bunch of gobbledygook
so for those out there who are like you break up the sentences they don't make any sense we
watched it all in a row he said so i'm here to disagree with rags when he brings up points about
blah blah blah not because there's a factual basis to the fact that he's wrong but because he's
factually wrong it's just like willow and quinton he said it in so many words that he fucking
contradicted himself and that is why that what he said is not concise this is what i try and do
which is to be explicit i don't always win at that but you know i like how in the chat they're
saying no factual basis to the fact but it's strange um the someone's saying that like having
to prove is like having to prove why why are you compelled to prove something if you have just
admitted that you can't it's just this is a strange thing to say like this proofreading is important
just don't have it be done by tiara are not ultimately 100% provable and are certainly not
anything resembling objective i've seen many people say something along the lines of it's a
well-made movie it's just a bad star wars movie which you can't really argue with which rags disputes
as he believes that it is both well okay serious thing he said you cannot argue with it you can
all you all it takes is for me to say i can't argue with it i've proven him wrong yeah because
if you look in the dictionary star wars movie doesn't actually have a definition you'd have
to talk to the person about what their standard would be for that yeah when you're saying it
cannot be argued right normally people mean that in a very colloquial broad sense like you can't
reasonably argue it but when you say you can't argue that this is a bad film or a bad star wars
film or whatever all it takes is one person to argue with you and you're done son that's all it is
well they would only be half right because the last jedi is a poorly made movie also it
is a bad star wars movie as well by definition of being a bad film it's a bad star wars film
i mean obviously again a bit coy but obviously they'll just take that very seriously and run
this into the ground let's think just the fact that i've disagreed i'm right because they said
you can't argue it that guy is like yeah i'll argue it i mean yeah if we're to take him very
literally so you can't argue with it he can but obviously we could give him the benefit of the
doubt and assume he's saying that you can't argue against what what is essentially a feeling of it
doesn't feel like star wars but the statement was it's not star wars let's even do that let's do
that because earlier on he said he's never heard any good arguments against it so he's making a
statement that he cannot possibly justify well like he shouldn't even agree with he should say
that yes it is a good star wars film let's think what he's he opened up by saying i've never heard
any arguments against the film and then he is saying that you can't argue against the film
by what method have you used to determine that that is not justification for you making that
statement you're not being consistent i'm like i said if we go with the benefit of the doubt
and assume i hate everything you're saying that there's someone out there saying it doesn't feel
like a star wars movie he'd be like well i can't argue that with you because you know blah blah
but the the structure of the the sentence came across as quite a bit different to that if you
were to well go a different way with it let's say all right she follows this by saying that he's
seen a lot of criticisms that are not oh hold up hold up wait yeah but that did that did happen
oh we someone's saying on the Dishonored Wolf podcast episode 14 at four hours 10 minutes and
10 seconds you said you would not be you said you wouldn't want him in the call we that that
happened that's different though um yeah that's different we wanted we wanted to react to this
video there was there was an idea that TRO might guest on it but the fact is like it's going to
cause chaos if we have not only this enormous video to respond to but we have someone trying to
defend it like i said that the easiest way would be what we did with CinemaSins since
respond to the video i'm not putting a condition on discussing things with him that's just whether
or not he would be on this actual stream in and of itself and i believe the conversation went
that uh if we were obliged to do that why wasn't TRO obliged to bring Rags on to discuss his video
before making it like there's uh there's no reason that that should happen it's just something that
we could do it's the Quentin thing when you get to the Quentin thing oh man that is oh that's
that's really just being dare i say it toxic oh absolutely like i i don't even think that's
i think that's just straight up true like what what Quentin said is blatantly not true about
a lot of us but um what we're okay with is is TRO coming on like that that's that's fine
yeah and if and if and if and i'm and i'm perfectly 100 percent uh i i i absolutely
will say that he misunderstood that i i totally agree i i feel nothing against the right but Rags
is never denied debating him but we're not we're not obliged to bring him on to when we're responding
to this video i wouldn't say that that's considered debate like we all TRO needs to do if he wants to
to come on is just um i would discuss he doesn't even have to watch yeah absolutely if he wants
to come on the next efap he can absolutely do that and i will happily set that up at the same time
if he wants to just move past it and be buddies it's fine with me too in fact i would prefer that
i'm totally willing oh yeah i'm i'm trying to maintain my relationship with him because
i think he's a he's a he's a good guy it's just that this is obviously unfortunate
because this is a bad video this was before he met either of me or Rags and for some reason
let Quentin loose like that was a mistake let's just put it that way here's the thing if TRO
if he watches this um then is like he he made some mistakes some pretty really huge mistakes
the Quentin part being a big part of it but if he wants to just move on that's fine with me
because man i no one needs more enemies quite frankly oh yeah which side of that shit yeah
obviously we didn't you know poke the bear here well i guess you could argue that Rags started
it by responding to i ate everything but i mean but then they had nothing to do with the right
opinion and then yeah that had nothing to do with me and yet i was brought in too so it was like
yeah that's very strange it was very antagonistic in that sense but even i would say that i didn't
i didn't i didn't throw the first punch i would say that i h e did yeah and that's the thing it's
it's all worth discussing i'd say and we'll absolutely set it up uh if TRO is on board with
that yeah real what is really bothering me about this entire conversation is that a lot of
criticism i would actually to me i i would be interested to see what he has to say about
things that we look at oh you mean like the video essays we've covered yeah like if he wanted to
cover one with us i would be interested at how he goes through those videos yeah we could always
find something that you know preferably would be someone he's not friends with because we've
covered quinton before so we wouldn't want him to have to do that we could talk about how kill
monger was correct yes criticisms but what is really bothering me about this entire conversation
is that a lot of criticisms for this movie are not actually criticisms at all oh like what now we're
just putting criticisms up in quotes okay he then proceeds to address this citing an example where
someone said that it was a bad movie because they didn't use the willhounds screaming it's just stupid
yeah but it's fucking so stupid even i hate everything said he's not 100% sure why even put
that in the video to me and wolf we we cited it we were like why did you put that in he was like
i don't know it's just it is something someone said it's like dude what the fuck does it matter
if someone said it's bad because it didn't have a fucking particular scream in it come on yeah i
mean that's pretty and again this comes down to well he did it because it exists and it's like
oh great that's our standard for content creation now i guess well i mean if it exists right yep
whinging about the last jedi being a bad movie simply because they didn't use the willhelm scream
sound effect yeah that really makes the film bad doesn't it wait you understand this video
is you whinging right that's what this video is it's you whinging as previously right yes i'm
yeah i'm using whinging in the same way that he used it yeah i mean you could ask for clarification
from rags if he wants to define what he means by whinging but uh or we could just take whatever
you're gonna take with it let's see where he goes this gets annoyed and asks why he's talking about
such statements what why are you giving these stupid idiotic things attention in time we've
had this discussion before he's talking about them because they're mildly interesting points
that exempt mildly interesting mildly interesting points really is not even i hate everything could
explain why they were just it's just stupid yeah man this is one of those things where it's kind
of like well it's this is uh i'm drawn to a parallel between this and when people defend leah
doing her little spacewalk yeah people said oh she trained in the movies between and then ryan
johnson said no she didn't it was like you're you're trying to defend something but like the
author of the material is saying no well um he's not he's we can't say that's wrong mildly
interesting sure tiaro maybe you find it mildly interesting maybe i hate everything does but do
you understand how much of a crap defense that is it's mildly interesting yeah he found the
criticism that there wasn't a willhelm scream mildly interesting like man that is a whoo that
it's just yeah it's just a low bar for for uh of all the comments you could have covered you went
with that one because it was mildly interesting sure whatever as previously ranks gets annoyed
and asks why he's talking about such statements what why are you giving these stupid idiotic
things attention in time we've had this discussion before he's talking about them because they're
mildly interesting points that exemplify the exaggerated reaction he then in turn gets
angry about why yeah yeah um i could take any cherry picked set of points to prove any narrative
about the last jedi i could pick all the ones that are overly in love with it and say this is
mildly interesting if you consider my point is that it's there's too much love for the last jedi
look at all these comments and i have you know i loved it because it didn't have the willhelm
scream in it and then i go see how ridiculous this is people are loving the film because it didn't
have a particular scream and i'm just as fucking devoid of content as as i hate everything was
at what point you trying to make you had some crazy person say they love a film for the stupid
reason yeah i'm questioning like why this of all things you know it's like this video is x you know
long so i'm wondering you you had the option to talk about anything you wanted and you chose that
you're like okay yeah well like is it so hard to just let that go it's like uh yeah i had
everything probably could have picked a more substantial comment like yeah that's basically
what i'm saying yeah we have to argue it because it's just like everything you said is just too
mean no no my answer is because it exists i criticize it because it exists and if that's
a good enough reason for i hate everything then that should serve as a perfectly good reason for
me how come you have not yet to the stupid insipid vacuous empty pointless completely
and we've already spoken about that too then a very special moment occurs which has confused me
to this day ij's comments about people complaining about science in a star wars movie and this is
followed by rag stating that he doesn't understand why quote you think i assume you being i hate you
things need explanations to be sent school you've been paying attention to this franchise
those are different movies yeah also that does follow so um lightsabers they don't need an
explanation to be sensical that's how they work they exist as long as they operate consistently
yeah so if someone slices it in half and it still works we've been shown several times that that'll
prevent a lightsaber from working so we'd be like hey if a lightsaber can no longer cut through
somebody it just hits them like a bat we'd be like uh hey that that doesn't make sense yeah
like when someone like um if a lightsaber operate our lightsaber operates by rules
it blocks blaster bolts and it stops other lightsaber blades but it cuts through basically
everything else so if you get if you tried if like if two lightsabers swung at each other and
they went through each other we'd be we'd have questions yeah it doesn't have to line up with
science in the first place we don't know the science behind it it's all basically gobbledygook
it's science bubble like hyperdrive we went over it earlier the internal internal consistency yes
it's about internal consistency it's not hard apparently to this day tro hasn't understood what
you were saying there so hopefully that explains it if he's uh listening to this hopefully yeah
internal consistency with watching the film my lack of science star wars while the absolutely
retarded design of the bombers at the beginning of the last jedi is not a particularly good example
for gravity i don't understand why you think maul's lightsaber still works after it's cut
in half you're all fake fans get the fuck out it was it was further to one side that's how it's
justified it was yeah it was huge though it was really long it was like four times the size of
a normal one and it makes sense because there is no science in star wars about space wizards god
taking so seriously things have to have explanations in order for them to be considered
sensical but then saying that it's a fact chris isn't why people should be concerned
it is by no means a poor criticism for people to ask themselves why very basic ten i kind of
want to find out what that was yeah all right we can uh scroll it back is not a particularly good
example for gravity i don't understand why you think things have to have explanations in order
for them to be considered sensical but then saying that it's a fact chris isn't why people should be
concerned it is by no means that was a fucking mess of flashy shit on the screen i'm not even sure
how much of it was relevant no i i didn't i didn't see it i don't think we're supposed to read it
there's no way if it comes off that quick i didn't i know i didn't see it at all um i'm more curious
about what you're about to say because i'm assuming he's going to rip into it chris isn't why people
should be concerned it is by no means a poor criticism for people to ask themselves why very
basic tenets of something do not apply to the rules of reality or the rules that have been
pre-established in a universe i then assume retrospectively that he means you as general
but the way he delivered it and the tone him he was refuting something and then he realized he
was making the wrong points either way it was how's that for reading into something oh yeah that's
so to clarify for the right opinion again uh rags is saying that it's absolutely a criticism
if uh it it betrays the previously established part of itself that's kind of what he was getting
at from from what i heard but that's that's just me i'm basically just asking for consistency in
something you don't have to you don't have to show how it works just show that it has a consistent
function exactly very very simple to understand i think that you could have given rags that with
just a little bit of benefit of the doubt to be like oh he's probably referring to consistency
internally because there's a very common thing that's discussed but hey rather than using now
whether the criticism is valid or not i think it's fair to say that a few gravity related
incidents are not a big deal we're not saying the whole concept uh it depends on what it has
happened which in this case it managed to destroy the dreadnought and save the fleet
yeah which is pretty important dude but hey there we are gravity was completely done wrong it was
clearly done on schemas that we're all familiar with he was addressing someone who took issue
with a specific scenario to do with gravity i don't know about you but i can see why that
is perceived as nitpicking why don't you explain why you just say it some people could call that
nitpicking it's not nitpicking because it saves the fucking day okay yeah man it's like that's
like a huge thing that happens people are just like you rag regularly that happened because of
a thing you're like oh i need to find what nitpicking is for us tiaro hags admits in this
video that he recorded this whole thing live without a script and the way he did it basically
was he would play a brief clip of i hate everything saying something and then he would respond to it
live this is an inherently flawed system that's what's coming from you you know people tell me
they love that they think i can't believe quinton is criticizing your methods that's insane that is
pretty crazy but man like people really like it and they say it sounds really sincere and
oh i just i don't know man like rags can you next time straw man the shit out of your opponents
uh don't show any context and uh call them warriors for a holy war just just do that
that'll that's the way to do it this what he's doing teaching you because what you do
where you show the context and then you respond as statements go past like we're doing now
that's shit don't do that fuck that here's the thing i'm not going to say quinton's useless
because everybody can profit from a bad example hmm i agree with that rags will play one sentence
of i hate everything's video at a time sometimes less and then he will respond to that clip for
minutes on end and it gets to the point that he has failed so heavily to connect one sentence to
the next that he stops even fully understanding what that's okay even if that were true that is
better strawman that is better than removing context deliberately yeah i mean here's the thing
i have really i would love an example because i think they've tried to give examples but they
don't really work but i if i have a complete thought and i remember a complete thought
doesn't have to be a whole sentence but if i have a complete thought then i will interject and give
my opinion yeah and and we do try on this and i'm sure rags will do it every once in a while
maybe when he's responding to stuff uh if there's a chance that we we have a statement and we're
like maybe something before or after it could uh support or or clarify it we give it a shot and
we'll always find out because we're watching your whole video mate on this stream we've done that a
lot yeah we always we always rewind to give the benefit and the thing is i give the whole video
so then i would hear the rest of the clip and so i just i just love it man the the fucking audacity
to criticize you like this when he removes context deliberately it's crazy though because if what he
was saying was true then i would stop my recording and then just resume his video and then the video
would say the thing and i'd be like oh that clears that up yeah oh quinton quinton quinton quinton
you make it very hard to like you oh this is bad quinton you should feel bad for it is trying to
say in the first place it's not a system obviously no no no no no no no quinton it's not a system
please don't call it that it is not a system i promise you it's not a tumor wait wait wait
it's not oh it says 48 minutes 30 seconds 48 minutes and 30 seconds yeah that's what it says
but it's like loading or spooling that's okay i'll just get us back what do you that'll do
standing what alex is trying to say in the first place through this system he obviously has no
capacity to understand rhetorical statements from motherfucker don't even bother i can't take you
seriously with with how you've responded to our content the idea that you're criticizing someone
else for their methods you the video is not loading for me ass uh do you want to try rejoining
see if fx is it yeah let me try that oh he's so full of shit
he is full of shit man is it uh 48 28 yeah 48 20 standing what alex is trying to say in the first
place through this system he obviously has no capacity to understand rhetorical statements
for instance but a lot of the discussion i've built a youtube channel of it besides you and tro
of fucking rhetorical statements from rags you haven't even they for example they've just made
shit up when when rags is like imagine saying that shit to mark hamill and it was just like
excuse me i hate everything is not saying this to bark hamill and it's like yeah okay that's not
what was happening i'm not saying he is i'm asking what what what if you did like it's supposed to
reveal something about what i hate everything he's saying but obviously that flew right over
everyone's heads in this fucking analysis questions around this movie are just straight
up malicious and overly simplified you have two choices you can either really love it
or think it's the worst film ever made or you can be like tro and think it was okay
yeah like tro even when he was at this part in the video he said he disagreed
like obviously ihe is wrong are they are those the only two options there's there's no middle
ground really whenever alex will do something like apply criticism i love it so he's accused
you of of taking a hypothetical and taking it seriously even though quint tro has said
in this video that he disagrees with alex's statement and quinton doesn't show where i've
messed up he's just like he he just plays me saying that all you know obviously there's
not you know there's the there's middle ground not the two extremes i don't understand what
what is someone supposed to take away from this because i haven't been like refuted what i take
away from it man is uh it's not okay when you say it but it's okay when quinton's friend tro says
it i guess because we both basically we both agree that i actually was wrong when he said
that and even if he was responding to how he seems that way well then my statement still holds up
because i'm asking hey quinton give this advice to tro because he didn't catch it either obviously
there you go rags you and tro get to learn a lesson today don't take i hate everything seriously
but that was your mistake unless you need to then do unless you should unless you should
all we do is the last jedi to the original trilogy rags's response is to defend the original
trilogy and then to act as if alex is saying that because the original trilogy is bad
the last jedi is better in comparison and it gets to the what does that even mean
that the original trilogy was bad so the last jedi is better in comparison i to unpack whatever
nonsense that was i believe that um i hate everything eventually takes a shot at the ot
and then you're probably going to make the claim that he i hate everything he's saying
that because the ot is bad that means that the new ones can't be considered bad because they're bad
too and that that would be what about ism i don't know if that's what he's going for so it might be
because maybe he's referring to i was pointing out the the rotten tomato scores and saying that
the rotten well maybe he maybe because i pointed out the tomato score for the old ones was higher
that means i'm defending them just give it another shot his response is to oh wait let's
go back a little bit because yeah i'm not really following and again they're doing see
see how they they criticize your method right of showing the person saying the thing
and then responding and yet they keep telling us what you said so we can't actually hear it yeah
and we already know they took me out of context so many times it's like why would we trust you
you're gonna have to show the clips yeah that's why it's that's the thing i love my content
because well the the it's not a system it's just the style but you know when one of us is talking
and it's in it's it's just it's linear it's in order i don't skip back and forth the back and
forth unless on very rare occasions and it's very on it's put there very prominently you are going
out of your way to avoid the many many many legitimate criticisms of the last jedi you can
see that rags and it are not on the same wavelength of what they want to discuss they're a legitimate
criticisms of the last jedi there are nitpicks and the only thing that it is trying to assert
is that the nitpicking seems to be more common in this movie than the previous one and rags is
asserting that's not the case yeah man i i don't know he hasn't even no one has defined nitpicking
yet i know if you disagree with that then that is fine but you are not entitled to a formal debate
there it is again i never said i was entitled to a formal debate and it's retarded that you'd say
that yeah and we offered it to quinton and he fucked off so we were not entitled to debate him
he's just welcome to speak to us all the intricate points because his video would go
on just as long as yours and that's not what he or the fan base enjoys i don't give a shit
what the fan base enjoys plus my fan base enjoys long videos actually and i think baller you get
plenty of comments from people who enjoy the long content they say i listen to it at work i listen to
it while i'm driving well i mean i know that for the next week i can drive to and from work and
have something to listen to i had everything got a backlash for his video so it clearly wasn't a
resounding success for his fan base not that i give a shit because that was never rag's point
it's like rat you shouldn't have made this video uh because that your audience won't
like it that's not ever something rags fucking said yeah that's weird that's that's very strange
he then says nitpicking a film to the point where you're purposefully ignoring the context
and intent isn't helpful to anyone rag then orders him to tell it to cinema sins
you just brought their name up so it seemed appropriate as if cinema sins would take offense
but cinema sins do it for a joke they continuously have to depends on who you talk to and what they
say at what time yeah man and it depends on what it is in cinema sins because some of their
criticism is legitimate and good and that's the thing the next one will be bad i and everything
is going to uh say that cinema sins has contributed to the negativity of like uh cinema culture or
whatever you want to call it and like tiaro's saying here uh excuse me they're a joke they're
not supposed to be taken seriously it's like yeah well i hate everything takes them seriously
i would say that cinema sins helped because it gets people to at least in some way think more
critically yeah like deconstructing the film it may have opened people up to that idea how
effective you are at it and you need information obviously it's complicated but um yeah i don't
even just just tells it yeah it stands the fact that i hate everything said that combined with
the fact that i had everything blamed cinema sins and himself towards the end of the video
the negativity surrounding cinema which very strange really sad to hear from i had everything
considering a lot of his criticism was very productive or constructive in terms of
pointing out how bad something could be structurally but hey someone says just
forget the fan base destroy it if you have to tell their fans not take their videos seriously
because they are by nature not a legitimate analysis no no no no hold up hold up wow
who wow by nature they're not legitimate analysis that's interesting wow that's whoo
cinema sins um who made you the fucking arbiter of what is and isn't legitimate criticism
and that's the thing people tell us that we do i know that damn that was a very telling statement
just to declare that uh cinema sins is not what was the word exactly let me just let's just get
it all against but cinema sins do it for a joke they continuously have to tell their own fans not
take their videos seriously because they are by nature not a legitimate analysis yeah that's not
so you there's quotes from jeremy saying as uh cinema sins it's funny that he's in the chat for
this uh they've said themselves that their outset was to criticize the current state of hollywood
that it's it's pumping out too much shit and that they want to point out where they've
failed miserably and they're not even considering the fact that they have many many influences in
in people saying like this they it's not that they can't make a good video all right yeah
putting it out there the cinema sins can make a good video it's possible also i would say that
it's not actually up to cinema sins to determine whether or not their own content is legitimate
i don't even i'm that's such a that's such a can of whims to open up you know yeah what do you
mean legitimate exactly that that's one of those things that's one of those words people use that
kind of needs a definition what do you mean legitimate criticism what is legitimate criticism
because they can say that they're not legitimate criticism but they could be depending on how you
want to say legitimate i'm curious very much about that statement but it's just going to be glossed
channel that seeks out the inclusion of people eating apples um someone could say that what i'm
about to say isn't a joke but if they say something and if somebody laughs at it well he's about to
point out that eating an apple is a sin um we already know that cinema sin sittens for the lack
of lap dances or for extended credit sequences at the beginning from producers and stuff so yes we
know that they make jokes i've made jokes in my videos it it's a thing you can do while actually
providing criticism comedians are often some people who do that some of the legitimate some
of his criticisms are good though and they hold up he makes some good criticisms in his videos
they're not all jokes yeah absolutely exist prize against the film they're not acting this way with
serious intent rag then try to matter what their intent is it literally doesn't matter what their
intent is yeah the criticism what they say may very well be a valid criticism just it would be
like me saying the sun is a star you'd be like see that's not a valid claim because he's joking
yeah it's like yes it is a valid claim what are you talking about
yeah it's like that's the thing you don't get to determine whether or not you're legitimate i
mean that's that's kind of circular reasoning is it legitimate well it's it's legitimate because
i said it's legitimate how do we know it's legitimate because i said it's legitimate
yeah conforming to the law or to rules so what are the rules of criticism
like well um do we gotta go down this rabbit hole that's my question it's like you didn't even
bother but yeah i hope i can if i ever do i want to do this in the future i need to catch myself
like when i say things like if i was to say legitimate criticism i need to like define that
what does that mean i need to catch myself stop myself and say well when i say legitimate
criticism i mean you know exploit to use the fact that i he notes that he goes into arguably
too much detail as some sort of equivalence the description of your destiny 2 review reads ihe
goes into arguably too much detail on bungee's new entry in the hugely popular destiny franchise
you made a 49 minute video review of destiny 2 where you admit to being nitpicky about it
and countless countless hours must have been spent editing compiling all of that footage
putting your thoughts together you know making those into a movie but if you walk through this
new 2 video before he's about wait sorry i didn't i think it's one of those yeah well i need to use
the loo anyway but he's i guess where this goes i bet a lot of people can understand what my point
is before i even make it they could follow it to the end of the road you know if he's saying
nitpicks are bad nitpicks are bad when it's applied to the last jedi you know and then and
sure enough his video on destiny 2 where he admits he goes into too much detail well i mean
was it bad then yeah i mean is it bad to do it to destiny 2 oh by the way rags i have no idea where
we are in your video you know like 51 21 no no no your video as in oh i don't either i have no
clue how much we've seen continuity what is it like this was gonna say it's such an interesting
thing to say but the continuity of this youtube video is confusing as hell um that's interesting
yeah capy gamer hello again um he said he i really hate how he's jumping from part to part without
any chronological order is like yeah that's true i have no idea where we are and the thing is i
haven't watched my video basically since i made it but um i have no idea where we are in my video
that's right i haven't even really thought about it because we're kind of following this
train wreck to the end of the rails but yeah man where are we in my video that's very strange who
knows but um i yeah i need to use the lube i gotta be that's right i will read some super chats
mark hamill is an absolute treasure to humanity this is true i feel like a channel called the
right opinion carries the smugness of a h bomb guy video just join the stream what does he like
uh he's he's not too smug he's a couple little bits like the one where he said that there's um
totally malicious content out there when rags was talking about videos and then he showed a bunch of
comments then he was like i'm pretty sure that proves it or something like that it's like no it
doesn't this is two very different things but okay so that there's a bit of that and it's like
it's almost like i'm saying you shouldn't be super confident when you're wrong because that equals
smug but it's like you know there's a lot of complicated stuff about how it comes down to
being smug i've been smug it's not like you automatically become h bomber guy if you smoke
he's like smug lord um hey man i like your content great rags pointed it out no no good good um i took
an art i took arthur's gcse and failed because i was crap how would they determine that it's
terrible if it's all subjective well that's obviously a lie that never happened you
sorry i have no thesis statement ah see that's where you've lost no thesis statement means that
you've uh you fucked up you and some other people will um will give you your thesis statement if
you don't have it they'll provide it to you like quinton he'll make a video just for you
his neck beard is where the thesis statements are loll been to a bar for two hours still not
half of the video yeah and we're at six hours and four minutes um i'm thinking we're probably
gonna call it soon i can just only well yeah i was gonna say do you think we should split this into
two um you know we could probably do that yeah that would be fine with me obviously it'll be
me and you again because me and you have pretty good schedules so we could probably set this up
relatively quickly yeah because i just i need to do something else man oh yeah this has been six
hours do you want to just this is the crop we will carry on from 51 minutes when we come back
to it how's that sound um let me see we're at 51 21 right now right someone said um
is rags dying no i drink a shit ton of water i drink a lot of water like i've gone through like
four bottles five bottles since we've been here because the water helps one adjust to high
climates and it's good for you because i'm about to do a rim to rim hike um at the grand canyon
later this month yeah i genuinely feel like it's six hours is a lot me and rags both need to do
human things in order to function i'm just gonna go fucking walk around play a video game or some
shit uh but what we'll we'll we'll definitely get it sorted out um as a closing thing of course
wolf left wolf's not been in a great place lately he's going to be releasing a video going over it
and after that he's going to be absent from efap for a bit now once we've done this quinton thing
and possibly had tro on for whatever might happen with that uh we've got a few guests
lining up and i've listened to you guys and i'm going to be contacting people to make sure we
try and get them on uh and so yeah lots to come efap is triumphant every frame of fap
that's that's that's the unofficial name uh i hope you guys have had fun is there anything
you want to want to say rags well hunter says uh hey rags and mauler the last jedi devonkel
caused me to unsubscribe to most of the analysis channels that i liked if you could crank out more
videos to compensate it would be nice well you're about to get a shit ton from mauler eventually
because his last jetta or his the force awakens thing is oh yeah
i'm gonna put an update on my patreon tonight because i didn't do it this morning i meant to
do it this morning but i'll give you guys a big update on how the project's going there is progress
lots of progress now i'll start making videos very soon too uh almost all the new artwork and
everything will be done for that really shortly yeah i was gonna say not you worry that's a link
to rags's channel in the chat now i don't know did you want to do some uh something specific
with this video now or did you want to i think because let's wait till the second part's out
let's wait till the second yeah yeah that makes sense uh so yeah that's that's pretty much it um
you can find this will be up in about probably like three or four hours depending on how long
it takes to process on my second channel which is mauler you guys can go ahead and jump on that and
you'll you'll get it when it's out it'll be public on there instead of unlisted here again
chat has died for me now which is really convenient when i'm trying to end so i can
see if people are asking anything but whatever can't do anything about that thank you all for
watching hope you had fun yeah i had fun this was awful give it another um people people were like
man he really got you and i'm like oh yeah maybe it maybe that's in the second half people
cite this video is destroying me and you which no wonder they think it destroyed us it doesn't
fucking have quotes from us in it you have to invent versions of us yeah man um but yeah uh
yeah rags hydrate for that rim to rim job soon there you go that was the last super chat thank
you again guys for the donations very generous and we will see you next time for the remainder
of this epic um goodbye bye bye
