trying to look at all the things on his shelves that are like good things that I
know he's gonna say stupid shit that kind of make me not want those good
things to be in there. He's got so much Witcher paraphernalia and it pisses me
off. Yeah I was gonna say I thought it was Witcher. Jesus Christ, he has like an
actual Polish version of the game on the top shelf just above his head to the
left. What the fuck man? I can't really read any of those ps4 boxes. You're
desperate to be like what else is there? What else do you like on his desk? So it's
like I want to make sure that okay blue Yeti I have a blue Yeti too you're not
allowed to do well actually blue Yetis are factually shit so I guess I can't
really say anything about that. Maybe at this point but like you know they were pretty
good for the price range. Yeah I mean that's why I have one because it was
like the mic I wanted to have I was like oh yeah that's $500. Fuck Marvel he
can't like that. Fuck he's got so much Witcher shit. It's like how do you like
something good but then also like something really fucking terrible. Yeah
well we'll probably end up mentioning it a few times but Rags is not here
currently. He does want to be here he's gonna jump in the second he's
available and well you know they'll be plenty to cover I'm sure he won't miss
out he'll be fine. And yes how is everybody welcome to what are we calling
this again? Every frame of pause. Efap. Abbreviated to a name but hey man you know if you
draw anything from that abbreviation that's down to you it has nothing to do
with us. Guys this this usually goes on for about four to five hours. Time to get
your efaps on guys you're gonna hear all these voices. People are starting to say shit like you know are you
gonna efap this video? Sure man. Oh man I'm already efapping. Yeah we all efap
together like the the audience is here with with the process that is efap so.
Yeah I mean come on it's just three guys over the internet. Efapping is a totally
natural thing for three guys on discord to do together. Oh yeah I probably should do
the actual normal thing and be like we have a guest today Mr. Smudboy who I
who have actually been on your channel twice before you still haven't seen
Solo yet have you that was our last thing we talked about you should see
that so we can we can we can rip into it. Oh bless your fucking soul if that's
the case. Well he told he told me to and I never got around. It's a good time to
invite him back so I could actually watch the thing and we can talk about it
because I'd be like oh geez I have no time to do anything so I might get around
it I think it's on DVD now I could probably get a good copy. Yeah yeah you
definitely can and it's it's not as like we're all we're all this right well if
it's not as bad as the last Jedi it's just so mediocre I suppose you'd put it
that way. Yeah it's not as bad. Thanks. Like it won't be as painful to get
through because I mean at least there's some shit that's like laughable like the
room kind of laughable. Oh that's okay though. Is that the thing we don't even you're gonna love the
the feminist robot we wouldn't have planned on one of the better parts of it
Chewbacca gets to actually affect things more than usual if because he's got
nothing to do in Disney Star Wars usually he just he's very stat if people
have said he's the same in the OT he's not the same in the OT he actually does
stuff in the OT like repairing C-3PO was actually pretty useful and you know
it makes sense that cuz he's you would be good with mechanical stuff if he's
he's not like Rey he's not just good at everything and yeah and shooting and
stuff but like you know he chills with the porgs for the most part in The Last
Jedi which is just like oh dear you're really running out of things for him to
do. This is the thing it's like just let I think a lot of people point out it's
like Chewie without Han it is difficult to write that and you probably should
have just dropped them both or really figured out what you're gonna do with
Chewie but this film actually has him doing stuff he like beats the shit out of
people. You know when I saw the
oh you're good I was finished on that. I remember before The Force Awakens came
out I saw this fucking I saw one of the trailers where Rey lifts her head up and
she's crying and you can't see what's below her but it looked like Chewbacca's
fur and I was like does Chewbacca die in this movie? Honestly he probably should
have. It's like oh god what are you doing with Chewbacca now. Oh I saw
there's a an actor from one of the original movies he's reprising his role
Will Munchkin what the hell are those guys called? Ewoks. Oh yeah so he had an
interview today with some magazine it's like oh that's nice he's getting a job
okay so I guess there's Ewoks in the next film. Who knows what we're going to call him. Good, thank goodness.
Yay. Also am I lagging a bit? A little yeah. Can you hear me?
Yes we can. Oh you can't. Yes no we can't. I'm still waiting for selected on
discord it's so distracting. Guys don't type dicks in the chat I know it's
efap but you got to keep that like out of the chat. Under the radar. Keep that to
yourself guys.
Mollett when yeah mauler when's when are you gonna introduce us to maul? No idea
what your problem is. Stupid into that it's never clear. I should all interact
with the chat rhino milk that's gonna be a thing. Oh that should be accounted for
actually can you can you actually hear me right now am I still just lambing
yes yeah you're fine okay it still seems like I'm delayed probably which I just
have to deal with right now um the the guy we covered in the last podcast he
unlisted the video in response if you will and he said that he wants to make a
new one that is more civil and addresses the topic in that he's sharing his
opinion rather than trying to say we were objectively wrong and on top of
that he's supposed to be coming on the next next week's efap so oh boy let's
see how that goes we'll probably have a cinema sins video we'll try and find to
respond to look at Jared's deviant art I didn't know he had a deviant art oh he
does actually yes I do you have the link for that I really want to see it now
someone tweeted at me actually I was gonna say I'm pretty sure I got it on
Twitter so you would have been added on that if you can find it hey I've had so
many I've had like 500 notifications in the last hour I'm not gonna be able to
find it someone tweeted at me okay someone right now Twitter wolf I want to
see what art because I've already seen his rags art which is beautiful so I
really want to see what other masterpieces Jared Genesis has made and
oh my god people keep doing the the rhino in the milk emojis in the chat wait
someone said maula can you watch maula versus the critics subjectivity war is
that the one the little potato made because I have seen that and it's very
funny there's a lot of work that went into it to be honest in terms of image
masking or at least putting things on top of stuff and he did share it to the
discord so it was good stuff and yet hopefully rags will be here soon but
until until he is we could always respond to the first video I was gonna
say I did say that we would do it last podcast and I forgot but they were the
reason a lot of people were like why did you say we said some of the lines of
like being called white supremacist by in relation to the Black Panther video
and he doesn't say anything like that I was like no what I was talking about was
there were comments that said it and we were hoping and we said this at the
beginning we were hoping that he didn't imply that at all about my video or
yours or anyone else's and he doesn't in fairness which is something that we
appreciate he didn't actually go that go the route of saying that we were racist
that's why we didn't like Black Panther he literally just stuck to the
inconsistent arguments so there was a comment that did say that and if once
rags issue we could we can just read it out with him because obviously he was
there for all the things so until then we can check out this first video if
if you're both on board with that are you
well let's do it I'm definitely delayed all right during how long that took you
guys to respond well it I'm not what was that I'm not a hundred percent sure
that we're actually like fucking functional right now I don't know if I
should just go and restart my internet fully instead of waiting until I fucking
disconnect to do it so awkward because I usually connect with I've got Wi-Fi and
then ethernet and if either one of them doesn't work I use the other but right
now Wi-Fi is just apparently not even responding to existence and ethernet is
all flaky so that's that's where I'm at and I would fix this problem if I didn't
be fun it wasn't a problem before I hit start streaming everything was fine up
until that's just like a thanks and I can't I can't did you run a speed test I
mean yeah well that it was fine like no there was no reason to assume anything
was gonna go wrong and it must be tied to the fact that I'm streaming discord
still says I'm disconnected from someone asked how's the socialist Wi-Fi oh yeah
we have shit Wi-Fi here overall I really want them just to move to a place that
has amazing internet that'd be nice if I'm gonna choose a place to move South
Korea there you go I'll go right there yeah it's gonna be awkward to try and
cuz I need yeah if you're gonna choose a place to live for internet don't choose
Australia just gonna say like I could just I was like you guys can continue
while I restart my incident I was like but this is my stream so it's not gonna
work out very well is it maybe you can just push the stream somewhere else I'm
gonna I'm gonna try one quick fix it doesn't work we'll just carry on my
stream might go down but it should be back up quickly okay so be right back
we shall return chat we'll just we'll just talk amongst ourselves then
Venezuela well they see that as a complete dodged bullet to be honest with
you they were like oh thank God that controversy came out well after that
game was sort of you know in the past shit that was four fucking years ago
goddamn almost exactly four years ago on a completely unrelated topic the FFF
thing is now really worth that Brett Kavanaugh joke about what the all the F's
mean but I was talking to the wonderful side of politics this Twitter day so yeah
I don't want to Google that too much just to find out what that means but
it's gonna be really disappointing if you're like where's this F thing come
from you like oh it's full of duty okay and then you find out Kevin Spacey was
in that game and it's like oh no no no no I watched the usual suspects recently
and I was like oh I forgot he was in it oh well it's fine it's just you can't
they really disappoints me you have to you see everything like oh right yeah
all that shit that happened oh yeah yeah cuz it's like I had like ten of my
favorite movies have a minute and it's like oh I don't know if I should like
this anymore advise me Hollywood how should I feel so anyway I'm good to
start on this this video first assuming everything just fucking works I don't
even know at this point let's just hope it does someone asked when's Eric tax on
gonna reply to me and he asked you as though you know you're curious what he
actually will yeah I look every few days cuz I'm like I'm eager to see you know
if your discord isn't not discord if your podcast isn't soon after he
uploads we might even fucking put it on here right I don't know oh yeah I
wouldn't mind either way cuz it'll be amusing more than likely yeah I just
keep thinking of that video he posted like I'm not very long it was like maybe
a week ago where it's just this guy who looks like like fuck what's your name
keep forgetting what your name is oh I'm all over yeah no it's good to meet you
mauler yeah I just haven't looked at it it's what's your foot smud smud yes oh
you want to go by by the way unless you have a human name you want to use what's
the mud is totally acceptable oh rags is gonna come in oh there you go I got him
okay so anyway there's this guy called Eric tax on who really doesn't like me
and he doesn't like me because I made this video called the problem with force
diversity which is a very well-liked video and a few people a lot of people
on tumblr really don't like that video for obvious reasons and he's one of them
and this Eric tax on guy he like literally looks like the bastard love
child of YMS and like some hobo under a bridge I thought you're gonna say like
like Bigfoot well I would say Bigfoot but that's too manly because Eric tax
on is a transgender guy only he doesn't know what his pronouns are he even says
it in his Twitter bio he just doesn't know what the fuck he is and he's
wearing like this pink shirt and it's just like aborted YMS clone looking
motherfucker and he said he wants to make a video responding to my video on
force diversity and I was so fucking on it implying that like it's already a
thing you know and we should be expecting yeah and I just write really
eagerly awaiting him to finally fucking make it oh someone said he's like YMS
and sticks and hammer I agree come to Canada learn all of the proper pronouns
that we're forced to use now and where we people unless they they don't ask to
be addressed and it's okay which is kind of he's the point but I said to wolf he
needs to start requesting people call him she'll leave a little moon for the
whatever they get it wrong you could be like how fucking dare you you'd be like
yeah you got him nailed it arrest them at that point it's part of my Slavic
heritage how fucking dare you yes hello rags how you doing doing okay
excellent we haven't really started yet so you're actually good we've just been
chatting and so you may as well this is smud boy rags rags mobile I don't think
you've ever met before so say hello hello good evening I do oh I'm I'm I'm
okay but you sound out of your mind you're right I don't know I'll hang
around I'll hang around you know you tell I don't know how if you slept
recently or not no no no you haven't slept I I've stared at my eyelids for a
while okay so we could we let me get wait the inner machinations of mine and
already there's the link for the wash together we're gonna tackle a brilliant
video explaining something to do with the last Jedi for three minutes before
jumping into movie Bob oh this oh this oh this was a bad one this was a bad
one I haven't even seen the whole thing I only saw as far as I was like yeah
we'll just do that on efap cuz yeah don't make sense so yes here we go this
is gonna be wonderful I'm sure come on get your efaps ready guys get this let's
get this all the way up there all right so when I really think about it it's
funny how the most hated movie of 2017 is the best-selling movie of 2018 oh my
god I fucking hate it already how many how many sales the room had I wonder
out of curiosity I don't know if you'd be able to find that now it would be
right it would be big I oh undoubtedly I mean people for ever since 2003 have
been going to like private feet like theaters showing the movie like little
theaters showing the movie or even just like fucking college gatherings they'll
show the movie just because it's so fucking funny and they would do an effort
yeah it's it's pretty much just anything yeah someone in the chat point now 50
shades of gray is the fastest selling paperback which oh my god that's so
fucking disappointing I can't believe
like okay already you're funny you've like said one sentence and you're
already fucking wrong it's Star Wars of course it's gonna sell out and well look
what look what happened because five months later solo comes out and it's the
first Star Wars movie that ever bombed it's right after the worst Star Wars
movie ever made do you think there might be a correlation there's a thing right
he says it like you're hated you shouldn't be successful it's like plenty
of people successful via being hated like that's a thing is the room but yeah
I mean maybe I wouldn't use the word hated well cuz it's like the obvious
thing we're trying to get out here is gonna left is quality that he's like well
it depends let's the quality and popularity have not much to do with each
other necessarily but if you're 12 years old you think that's the case so that's
what you open your YouTube video with I mean I'll just put it into perspective
the one of the first reviews about the room when it came out in 2003 described
it as the room is like being stabbed repeatedly in the head that is an
actual review of the movie and it is not only a movie that's being shown in
theaters like worldwide now because it's so funny but Tommy Wiseau also has other
acting jobs he just came out with a two-part movie that's actually unironically
good he's like got these parody videos of him being the Joker now which is kind
of creepy because it's actually not bad and just because it's just because it
makes money doesn't mean it's good look he hasn't made that argument yet he said
it's interesting the most hated movie is the best-selling which to me doesn't the
argument he's gonna make because no of course that doesn't sound like a
contradiction to me anyway you know being the most hated thing but also one
of the best-selling things because for example mr. Plinkett would have bought
the film to review it and I don't know if you guys got the impression if you've
seen his video that he loved it I don't think he did I think he rather disliked
it and he would have been one of those sales so they go yeah I mean I went into
the movie thinking it was gonna be good I came out hating it it's Star Wars
people went in expecting it to be good now people don't expect that anymore
and it's because of this fucking movie but you know he's gonna use that argument
because that's what every fucking Last Jedi Defender does is they pull these
really shitty arguments out of nowhere like oh it made a lot of money so that
must mean it's good well let's let's see where he goes with it you know he
couldn't there's the rest of the idea could be that he's like you know it
makes sense because some things sell well when they hate it that's probably
what it is let's let's go it's not gonna be what it is so you all know what I'm
talking about Star Wars the Last Jedi if you look into your little Twitter bubbles
and your little Facebook Twitter groups of 120 people who all they do is hate
Star Wars it's the worst movie of all all right let's go to YouTube oh god
here we go I've been let's type in the Last Jedi let's see what pops up oh the
last there's Plinkets review that's at 1.7 million we got Vito which is at 2.5
million why it's a complete cinematic failure all right more than cinema sins
everything wrong with it 3.4 million more than definitely more than mine oh boy I
mean I don't know man oh yeah there's a lot of Facebook what do you think well
there's a lot of Facebook groups that I used to go on I think in January of this
year I think I stopped in February where they weren't hating the the movie that
there are there are the actual groups that he was referring to that just
every day it's like oh this is another thing that Ryan Johnson said yeah that
got kind of monotonous but there were the the fan groups which were you get
people of all different ages and different backgrounds talking about oh
you know if only they made Justin Bieber a Jedi in the next movie and all
these other bizarre ideas so they were just as crazy on either end and it
didn't matter whether they hated it or liked it there was something that they
wanted to celebrate well yeah so one of the first reactions I saw from positive
stuff was like oh my god look what they've done with force ghost now we can
it's in my original rant video because I saw the comment I wish I put it on
screen they said now we can finally see force ghosts fight like Yoda versus
Palpatine doesn't that just sound awful well it's one of those oh let's just say
that the people who don't like this movie let's just call them a bunch of it
just trying to label them as you know X group they hate them they're just these
these little groups of people and they're out there and nobody there's not
really many of them right he's trying to frame it that these people yeah they're
a very loud minority you know they don't pay attention to them because there's
not really that many of them they're just in these tiny little Facebook
groups of 120 or whatever don't listen to them I know that this is not an
argument but why is it that every single person that defends the last Jedi looks
like this it's just like some scrawny fucking middle-aged man who has no
fucking dick or respect for himself they usually say that like people who hate
the last Jedi usually neck bearded you know basement dwellers like that's
that's usually what it is like like as a comment on it and it's just yeah I know
at least one brown person that doesn't like the movie that's true that's true
we know two don't we we know oh yes I always think of Fringy as green though
so true I don't know he still appears enough color at that point yeah he is
the only person of color left why does all colors combined I'm a person of
colors we need a Daniel Day-Lewis rendition of the last green ass Jedi is
the worst thing to ever happen to cinema like the room no one has ever said that
fuck off I just yeah I don't I don't think I don't think the worst thing to
happen to cinema like come on it was something to happen to Star Wars yeah
but not cinema is that like if someone's saying that not already straw man
he's been fucking a minute I don't know all right I think arguments could be
made what for sure but I'm not sure what I would choose the film that did the
most damage to cinema interestingly though that the last Jedi has caused
such a like I'm not sure what the right word is here but basically an
idea where everybody's reevaluating critics on YouTube like that happened
thanks to the last Jedi more so than any other film oh yeah like this the last
Jedi made efap take any large franchise and let's say James Bond and use social
media or politics or anything to change the actual formula what a bond film is
and it's gonna be a big thrust of people who hate the thing now simply
because it was not what they were wanted to get so it doesn't really matter what
the formula would be whether it's a big franchise that's where a lot of eyes are
on it and therefore you're gonna see a lot of people react to it it's gonna be
newsworthy so for a gentleman like this if you look at as we were talking before
about the things that he likes it's everything that's popular and he's gonna
have something to say about that so maybe he has some insight into what
actually is popular and why who knows he likes the fuck out of the Witcher yes
oh yeah I was talking about that before we went live it's like almost everything
in this frame is Witcher related and it makes me angry because it's like you're
not allowed to have good things and round if you're gonna make shitty
arguments like this still yeah I'm not sure what I would pick for film that was
the worst thing to happen to cinema it just seems so like hyperbolic to me but
again we're seeing happen to Star Wars maybe I could definitely see arguments
for that it's like high caliber compared to the last Jedi okay and of course it's
all the fault of the women in the franchise this guy's a polygon rider I
guess or something he's no one's ever said that it's never been said by anybody
yes maybe he was right he is referring to a fringe group of like three dudes
across the entire internet who said that uh it's the worst thing to happen to
cinema and it's because of women is it the women on the editing staff or was
just the women in the movie I'm guessing it was the women in the movie I think no
women are safe yeah actually it's any woman that had any hand in production
actually no yeah any woman at all just unrelated to stalls even those ones
just the concept of women Schrodinger's woman by the movie nobody saw the movie
apparently even though Star Wars track record shows you that the middle of
every trilogy is the weakest one yes women in it that's a very that's a very
poor understanding of storytelling or just to say a trillion a trilogy in
general that the the second part of anything is the worst one I we were just
talking about Lord of the Rings and I was saying how much well my knowledge of
Lord of the Rings but I was saying how much I liked the two towers it was
probably my favorite part of the whole trilogy so to say that a movie franchise
that happens to be a trilogy and the second one being the weakest I'm kind of
curious where he's going with that I mean Empire is universally accepted to
be the best did he say it was the weakest a quality or do you imply that
it's the weakest for view count because it did seem to be maybe that it was aimed
at popularity rather than quality but even then it sounded like view count I'll
just I'll just run it back I think you all saying that but even then I don't I
don't know if that's true even though Star Wars track record show yes Star
Wars track record I don't know how that could possibly be true every trilogy is
the weakest one the weakest in general yeah weakest is it no that's what he's
saying I guess so Attack of the Clones and Empire struck back well like we can
compare it we can compare the genres to let's say movies or video games and say
we'll look at a popular space opera and I know Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 is
perhaps the most popular version of all the three so I don't know what what he's
getting at here people are pointing out spider-man 2 in the Dark Knight and
that's oh yeah wow okay well again if he's just saying the amount of views it
grabs is typically the second one takes a dip compared to the first maybe maybe
he means popularity sales wise or I don't know is he trying to say that
that's an explanation for why it would have done worse on the force awakens
because I guess yes aliens Back to the Future 2 the Godfather the two towers is
very ambiguous yeah I don't know we'll see where he's going with this video
pointless well no he's saying arguments ad popular there because it didn't sell
the most it's the worst and again we're looking at a guy who has all kinds of
popular paraphernalia around him but this is the world he's at if he's saying
Last Jedi can't be that bad considering it's the best seller when he's just
admitted that Empire Strikes Back sold the worst out of the originals even
though it's typically looked at as the best doesn't it mean that these things
don't connect then we'll see while his argument flows we don't we're not sure
where he's getting it Empire Strikes Back I mean first off the Phantom Menace
is worse than the attack of the clones already so you're wrong on that front
are you sure there's a lot of discussion about that the Last Jedi is the worst
and according to the the worldwide box office for the original trilogy the the
first and if made the least but five and six are really close so hmm but it's one
thing to go with that came out in theaters and it carried on selling
insane numbers and at this point we have a September reports it's the top
selling blu-ray and DVD worldwide okay the comments of his videos imply that
he's not really interpreting that all good someone someone said that Black
Panther outsells it in home media so I I'm not exactly certain is he trying to
argue that the release date of infinity war anything very sales Jedi I mean
infinity war didn't come out a couple weeks after the Last Jedi it was like
months after was it yeah before cuz solo came out not long afterward also I've
been in I've made a spin that was five months away I've made a small fix I'm
hoping this night is level now for anybody because in chat I was noticing a
couple of people picked up that not only is the stream a bit laggy but that
everything's out of sync in terms of I say a thing and then you guys say a
thing way later and and the video hopefully it's fixed now so just just
update keep going yeah in infinity war came out April 27th so the end of April
so a couple weeks guys for January February March April so four months it's
possible but that's a third of a year later I'm still stuck at how meaningless
this all is anyway best-selling does not mean that it was not bad well yeah
the whole the whole premise of the point is that if it's so bad then how come a
lot of people spent money on it and the fact that he's already registered the
Empire Strikes Back assuming he's right sold worse than the first or third in
the original trilogy to me I'm just like okay then so we agree this is
meaningless if we're talking numbers when it comes to like blu-ray sales
blu-ray sales of the last Jedi are way behind the force awakens as he just said
though the second one always takes a dip so that explains that get fucked rags
checkmate
all right and United States so does any of that hatred actually correspond to
anything that people are saying because let's be realistically talking about
this let's be realistically I know it's like every other word that comes out of
his mouth it's like oh my god you're language bad I wouldn't have a problem
if it's not for likes like it's only three minutes dude you could have like
you know given another shot whatever it's fine I'm really disappointed by the
fact that he's playing the Witcher 3 on a fucking PlayStation it's okay man
maybe this video is basically of course God's real look at how many people go to
church also yeah I just realized he may have the controller that doesn't mean he
necessarily plays on the console wolf is still hope still some hope hates this
franchise all right and they hope then why is it making so much money hates the
franchise of why is it making money why is that hard to believe
like what's hard to what's hard to register about that beaver one direction
I mean it's like is I swear this is a 12 year old oh yeah well if it's so bad
then how come it's making lots of money like definitely talks like a 12 year old
oh yeah I'm just stuck at the point where it's just like yeah as you guys
just said transformers how'd you explain that if transforms was so bad why is it
selling so well explain that just lame make a better argument why are people
buying this movie if they hated it so much a lot of people aren't you know a
lot of people are you're taking the sales from when the movie like first came out
in theaters which doesn't fucking count because look out it just because the
movie made a ton of money when it came out doesn't mean anything because look
I went into the movie thinking the Last Jedi was gonna be good it wasn't good so
my opinion adjusted accordingly just because the movie made a lot of money
when it came out in theaters a Star Wars film like one of the most like arguably
the most popular movie ever of all time yeah because he's gonna make money
because he's saying basically that oh yeah with the Last Jedi he's in a
ruinsound blu-ray and he's not saying that the Last Jedi blu-ray sales are 56%
of the Force Awakens also that's this huge draw when was this video made was
made it September 19th yeah days ago okay it's public knowledge that solo was
the first Star Wars movie to flop and it's the first start it was the very
next movie after the Last Jedi and I have said for a while that I would
assume the damage from Last Jedi would be seen in either solo and episode 9 or
episode 9 that we wouldn't be seen in the Last Jedi sales because people bought
the Last Jedi going into seeing the sequel to Force Awakens you know I would
say that the blu-ray sales and have a bit to do with it because if people saw
it and didn't like it then why would they buy the blu-ray well see this is a
complicated subjects you've got a lot of different factors that come in for
example the debate we had with that guy for the first time well he actually
despite us explaining extensively how much we really hated the movie he still
asked us like well you're still getting the blu-ray right it's like what like it
seemed odd to him that you wouldn't buy a Star Wars film like that's something
that you that's something everyone does you just do that you just you know and
imagine lots of families were just like yeah let's let's let's buy it why not
we'll pick it up and then you've got people like Plinket several other
reviewers who despise this film who were like yeah we need to buy it because we
want to see the extra features to be able to make a cogent complete review of
all the information we can get there's so many different I have the blu-ray of
the room shelf I'm looking at it right now which means it's good right yes means
it's high quality entertainment okay well yes objectively and there are some
people who didn't watch it in the cinema and they were like yeah I'll just get it
when it comes out
and yeah I mean I don't know why we're arguing all this anyway it's just like
this is pretty this is pretty fundamental stuff I'm pretty sure solos
blu-rays will take a huge hit like they're not gonna be popular but that
doesn't mean that I wouldn't even say that's evidence of solar being bad
because I think so is better than the last Jedi so yeah I'm curious I think
the best way to find out is what's not maybe sales numbers but the like the
percentages of you know sales in relation to blu-ray you know like box
office to blu-ray as a comparison not you know just raw numbers what
percentage of you know people who saw solo got the blu-ray compared to what
percentage of people saw the last Jedi and then got a blu-ray oh dear well I
mean there's no much left so pacing so far ahead of so many other movies that
apparently people love I'm just asking a question they're not begging the
question and then I know people are gonna bring up out but it killed the
brand that damaged the franchise look at what solo did for numbers I mean look at
its merchandise will class bullshits have gone through that extensively it's
bad massive damage to the to the sales of merch I guess you'd say overall as
for the blu-ray sales like I said there's lots of ways to explain that but
I suppose this fundamental question is how do you know it's done damage then
I'd be like I guess I would go with it with the merch option argument but
overall I'm already aware because of the amount of in the insane portion of
comments I've had on my videos of people basically saying Star Wars is out Star
Wars is done they're never gonna you know give Disney Disney another dime
people will refuse to watch MCU movies because of what they've done to Star
Wars like that this didn't happen before as extreme let's put it that way it's
like what would you buy when you think of a lot about The Lost Jedi what would
you buy a toy of you know who in that movie makes you want to go man I want a
toy of that person to put on my you know my in my collection I really want this
character I went I mean granted that character won't be the same character in
the next film probably well what about The Last Jedi makes you go man I really
want a toy of this character well Bob Iger just I'm sorry Bob Iger released a
comment two days ago about the slowdown that they're doing now franchise so
whether that means that they're paying attention saying hey we realize biggest
flop did not make any money and money we did not is not gonna be made on DVD or
they're hoping that Kennedy's believes that they're hoping that they're gonna
make money on the DVD that's a very hopeful comparison is like oh are they
slowing down the MCU to it's like no the Sun or some shit this is the thing
it's had a real impact how bad The Last Jedi is and that was the other thing
just one last argument on top of all this is like for why I know it's
affected Star Wars The Last Jedi has got piss poor writing I already know that's
gonna have damage especially Luke what happened to Luke you've you've done
irreparable damage to Star Wars as a fucking franchise when you destroyed
Luke pretty simple yeah I saw a video recently from Star Citizen that game
that's coming out at some point in the history of the human race and Mark
Hamels in it and Davos Seaworth so that's fun but people in the comments
were like Mark Hamels acting more like Luke in this movie than he did in this
game rather than he did in The Last Jedi and it's like oh man literally if
there's a movie where he's like a member of government arguing for policy on you
know some some shit in 2023 it's like a futuristic ish movie that we just be
like man he's he's close to Luke here then in Star Citizen he plays is like an
actual like star fighter pilot yeah or captain or whatever he is and it was like
oh Mark Hamels actually being Luke but in the video game I can see like
directors or someone being like should we just should we just fucking make a movie
about like a space wizard Mark Hamels we'll just give you a movie that you
should have had oh that'd be the best that would be absolutely called planet
fights planet moon wars
one solo had two months of marketing to it was right there next to dead you're
insane you're making shit up I don't think so months of acting Deadpool 2
didn't come out for another month after solo in Infinity War and Infinity War
and solo didn't come out until five months after The Last Jedi you're just
blatantly getting shit wrong yeah cuz solo was made 10th Infinity War was
April 27th I'm in Deadpool 2 I mean I remember I watched that he's like okay
so I've just made the argument that so Jedi Last Jedi hasn't hasn't had an
effect on the marketplace like people want you to believe then it's like oh
shit I've got to account for solo it's like that came out at the same time as
Deadpool 2 and Infinity War and it's it was badly marketed and a bunch of other
stuff look there you go Deadpool 2 is May 18th okay so Deadpool 2 was after
okay but the thing is like we're it's treated as though Star Wars has to like
come out on its own because other franchises will stop it from being
successful which is ridiculous well he's saying that Star Wars is at a point
where it has to like we're Deadpool the Deadpool movie is a threat to a Star
Wars film yes I gave my ticket money to Deadpool 2 and walked into the Star
Wars theater so yeah it is a threat well that's the thing I mean I don't know
about you three but like I'll be seeing the next Star Wars film almost as a joke
I'll be like this will be fun yeah I'm just curious yeah that was how I went
into solo so yeah I'm not even gonna remotely take episode 9 seriously and
like at this point I just be like is this video trying to argue that the Last
Jedi can't be as bad as people are saying because it should have a more
detrimental effect on the marketplace and in which case I would just be like
you're done because plenty of bad things make money and it's like I'm trying to
make up for it by being like solo came out at a difficult time blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah I agree that these other elements that would have
cost solo you know money-making abilities but like there's no way you
can deny that the hatred towards Last Jedi would have had no effect
at least one guy didn't go and see solo because of the Last Jedi that was a
thing that happened in this world people that wanted a solo prequel from the
beginning I mean I didn't think I needed it I really loved the movie but I didn't
think I needed before so there's a few reasons to look at why solo didn't do as
good as it did but the Last Jedi is a completely whole different story and
then let's bring merchandise into this because I've seen the reports I can't
talk about yet and we'll just wait till the end of the year to talk about Star
Wars toy sales because uh-huh you don't need to wait till the end of the year
war shooters is already talked about it a hundred times now I was about to say
like he's got some real ass evidence and this is the thing Jeff is obsessed with
like he knows his shit about toys like this is it's like his forte so I would
be interested to see him and this guy discuss talk about toy sales we'll talk
about that at the end of the year when I get my speech impediment he just
implied that he's got special information that he can't reveal I was
just like wait what yeah why I'm curious why toy sales would get I mean I
generally you'd think that once the movie releases that would be you know
then the toys start coming out and such and such but you know there's a pretty
big gap in Star Wars right now very similar objects like do you want to get
your holdo and Rose Tico toys guys like no the other day when they texted you
that picture of that really stupid looking Dustin toy from stranger things
oh god it's like oh my god I think people would rather buy that just
because it looks so funny that I can't even see people wanting to get phasma
toys now because you should be like oh phasma the lame ass that fucking fell
down a hole yeah remember all the cool shit she did like die for anybody who's
like the same as Boba Fett it's like phasma didn't do anything like I don't
even like like I don't even like Boba Fett and I'd rather have a Boba Fett toy
than a phasma toy god yeah and I don't even want toys I would take Django any
day over phasma well that's not a surprise cuz I'd play as Django Fett in
stars battlefront 2 rather than phasma although I don't own battlefront 2
because I don't know if it made you bulletproof you'd pick it let's be
honest I'd just mod the game if the book if the blaster bolts would hit my armor
and bounce off and hit my teammates then yes I would you get booed for friendly
fire like pretty sure without telling you that's gonna be way higher than you
think it is so it's not way higher than you think it is that's okay so yeah I
guess he's got special access to information well I mean what I think it
is is that they're in absolute the shit they're just in the absolute shitter
remember this and take it to Jeff sometime just to see what he says cuz I'm
absolutely cuz Jeff's made how many videos on this I mean he's made he's
had some really super compelling evidence to prove wait he goes into the
stores and he goes to the Star Wars sections and they fall because no it
gives a shit yeah I mean and then this guy is like I don't I'm going to show
you the evidence off the gun here it turns out those admiral holdo and rose
tea co-action figures are selling like hotcakes well this is the one day it's
even stuff like millennium Falcons aren't selling as much like like it's
all going downhill and well apparently this guy's got additional information
that he can't share yet so we'll just have to take his word for it you trust
this guy right guys no I couldn't no I'll explain the Witcher 3 and a PS4 I
already don't trust him well the thing I don't trust is how those figurines are
standing on top of that computer monitor yeah I don't I've been trying to figure
that out that's a plot five minutes now is it's really cuz the stands are
clearly like circles they're circular but the top of a computer monitor is
very thin I think I saw like a little blank behind it it looks like there's a
little shelf right yeah if you look to the very left of the monitor still
bothers me though very strange very strange apparently movie Bob's released
a video I've heard this from a couple people where he he's basically sort of
accidentally or purposefully shat on the first two Predator films and he's
disabled comments as well because of the backlash already so the second one okay
I didn't like the second one but the first one I mean I'm interested to see
what he would say but like yeah the first one good luck trying to criticize
that it's gonna be tough like it's a very tight film but you know is it the
same kind of criticism as what's his fucking stupid name the guy who hates
you a lot which one dude this is the one who has the super punchable face with
that ugly like not good beard who is in Kane I think you're talking about quits
about you yes that's it I mean well we're gonna get a whole dose of movie
Bob in a moment so movies the worst thing ever everybody hates it nobody's
saying everybody hates it otherwise there wouldn't be a constant discussion
about how bad it is let's be honest comes from feel free to let me know in
the comments below but if your argument is is this guy's not gonna be pleased
with the comments on this video are they not there they're about what you'd
expect I mean in fitness to have you had he gave himself three minutes and 20
seconds to dismantle the idea that the Last Jedi is bad it's like he's done
toy seals yeah what's it like to dislike ratio on it it's less than it's less
than 50 let me it's at 47% but it's only got like 10,000 views and this
is from a channel with 452,000 subs which is odd Wow really what's yeah can
you find out what his thing is is it usually not this sort of thing well it's
comic book cast to it's an online geek culture community our mission is to
deliver content that helps you embrace the film TV comics and gaming that we
all love in a unique way and having a few good laughs in between and this
channel get shit for views sounds like next-gen tactics all over again what are
the I'm just checking the most popular stuff hulk versus Thanos in Avengers
Infinity War hulk is terrified and afraid that's their most popular video
okay seems a bit seems like you don't need to see that video that's a very
strange title spider-man live-action suits compared and breakdown compared and
a breakdown is oh I guess it's the actual live-action suits compared and
breakdown I guess that's how they wanted me to read it break down dude why is
that as different colors the MCU and avenge well hey you know what if that's
working out for them but yeah all the top videos of the MCU basically you
guys keep going I gotta take a piss real quick well yeah well I'm sure there's
not much left of Asians yeah or a woman leading the army who has purple hair
and it's not acceptable but a fish man who's only ever you know that's not
really he's saying the best arguments for the last I guess yeah this is this
pretty insane Asians or a woman leading the army who has purple hair and it's
not acceptable but a fish man who's only ever yelled fish man is beautiful I was
gonna say that's that's racist dude just cuz he's a fish doesn't mean he's not
qualified yeah come on basically he's shitting over admiral Akbar do you have
a problem with salmon colored skin I can't believe you I'm upset by this
he's he's basically I you know it's the whole you know if it's women or Asians
it's bad and admiral Akbar is a shit you know the idea that admiral Akbar who is
an established character should have should have been the one to replace one
of them I don't know I think the whole ball gown and people here thing it's
like it's a very it's fucking very confusing to see yeah a lot of the ball
gown if you're gonna if you're gonna be a leader of our time scenario you don't
wear a dress yeah this isn't Trump's resistance or something that you do from
home this is a war and you're generally like badges or like a hat or some sort
of insignia or it's really distracting so this is the thing it's like it does
it so that ruins the movie it's like no it's just something to pick up on isn't
it no it's just it's very weird and distracting like imagine she was dressed
like like a ke Guevara with the brain the vest and whatever like she would
look like oh she's part of a resistance team in space maybe make it a space age
style resistance outfit maybe she's ready to hop into a fighter maybe she's
ready to to lean back or something like a like a diplomat something but to dress
like you're about to go to the prom or a good night in the town it's like at
least give me some visual understanding of the setting that you're part of but
I can connect a and B as opposed to I'm in charge because this story told me I
am I wonder what percentage of the resistance's budget is for hair dye
upkeep so I can't afford why wings since well Wolf's gonna be back in a minute
but since you I said I wanted to say this when you're here right but in the
last podcast we mentioned that um there was there was comments about white
supremacy and I was just gonna I'm pacing you the the snap of the comment
I was gonna say if you want to if you want to read that I was in relation to
mine and subsequently Wolf's videos on Black Panther and we I was gonna say you
can you can stop and we could respond to bits of it if you wanted all right so
what is so this video this comment was posted on what video this is on the one
cinema sins sins made the last I mean we responded to it two days oh yeah the
the one we're talking about the one he made unlisted yeah all righty so this is
in response to okay so turbo nerd oh said this video mauler made is teetering
dangerously to white supremacy which is letters white supremacy because the main
criticism stems to advanced society and African culture are incompatible no
Mike society and African culture are incompatible well it's not that they're
incompatible there does not seem to be an immense amount of overlap between
those two but that doesn't mean that they're necessarily incompatible there's
there's loads of people should post pictures on discord of modern African
culture that's blended with technology it exists if you remember one of the big
things I pointed out was how embarrassing the design team were and
they were like okay so we're gonna have these slick steel towers and it's like
cool cool how do we involve African culture it's like well you know like
straw huts poverty we'll just shove one into one of the towers the movie gives
the impression that poverty is African culture yeah that too there's a lot of
shit just like you know the big lake that was next to the city they should
have like added like one of the Haiti garbage heaps right in the middle of it
because that's African culture man it's like you could have things like dress
and design and style to reflect you know some kind of African culture but
that doesn't mean that people have to be walking around in the streets like this
is some kind of a low-class poverty-stricken marketplace neighborhood
those aren't the same but it does look like the designers of the film were like
what when people say Africa what gets people think about Africa Oh mass
poverty so let's chuck that in too but it's very interesting that he thinks
that maybe he got that from the whole maybe he got that from the whole trial
by combat thing which is retarded and has another African or European or
example like that's that's that is a thing that you only find in like a
tribal society because of how I'm proud is completely impractical it is and how
self-destructive it is to a society I mean it's in Game of Thrones some means
it must be advanced right oh yeah and that works well for everyone you play
his ridiculous claims up for laughs but I think it's a dangerous reminder of
inherent biases that society is being equivocated with Western culture and
anything else is considered barbaric well kind of is but well I mean would I
would I'm not saying that I agree with a statement however whatever is the most
advanced culture would every other culture not be maybe not barbaric but
less civilized by comparison would that not be the logical conclusion there yeah
I don't you could make the argument that the inclusion of technology in the
society because it's a hidden society and they're as inconspicuous as possible
that they're just sort of slamming stuff together so you have like this
amalgamation yeah of rule and urban areas and you just sort of thrust together and
then you can look at the tribal aspect of the African culture that dance the
drums the rhythmic sounds like these can be incorporated it's just that would you
think someone as sophisticated as intelligent would not say hey you know
what let's let's clean up this place it's kind of dirty it's like we can we
can make a black panther suits you know we have access to this advanced
technology but we're also simultaneously not intelligent enough to understand
that trial by combat to determine who our dictator is is self-destructive to
the society which yeah somehow that hasn't actually had any detrimental
effects to them yeah since their inception which is crazy to me yeah you're
talking about technology versus social so stuff like that you can get away with
as well as being a comic book if you ever read any of the Black Panther comics
it is a very tribal system so it's like okay but we're talking about I don't care
too much about the comic books really well if the comics assists the the
reality of is like it's irrelevant to the to the film alone if you will but
from what I've heard the comics make more sense than the film does right if
you're talking about levels of other things in science medicine a hierarchy
of people who are on the top and there are there is a some sort of aristocracy
and then they would have people beneath that surf dumbs if you're doing a
monarchy stuff like that there's I think there is a scene where there are
people in villages or huts outside the the closed-off city so that would have
to be yeah right it's like a front but it's still part of it so there has to be
some sort of amalgamation that slowly and slowly removes that as you get to
the higher level tech and that's fine it's just that it can't just suddenly
be hey we have chickens and cows running around on our tower or yeah we're not
we're gonna ride on horses even though we have spaceships you know stuff like
that it doesn't make sense like it feels like somebody decided let's throw tribal
and high-tech space age stuff together and it's like well yeah that's what they
did and I'd be like yeah I'm saying that my
immersion is broken because that's what it looks like regardless of how much
sense it makes but yeah just to counter their point anyway I know about other
culture or at least I'm aware of other cultures outside of Western that I don't
consider to be non-advanced I suppose like I'm not stupid Asian culture for
any country is completely different from Western but it doesn't mean it's it's
barbaric compared to look I'm just saying Western culture got us to the moon
Eastern gave us anime and well one's better what did Wakanda do I think
Japan just landed a probe on a meteorite or something today they still
had anime so well that's true yeah anime is more valued than that of course
exactly hey come on death notes great so yeah he's above all the comment goes on
seriously these were the arguments being used when Britain were in the
height of their colonial power except back then the argument would have been
correct as if as if that's why I'm making this argument I spend more time
with American culture than I do with my own at this point online like I just
find this ridiculous it's like oh come on as if I can't take it seriously but
this person is that convinced that I'm I'm completely brainwashed by my
Britishness and I also I'm dangerously close to being a white supremacist come
on I literally just criticized your stupid little film about a superhero
like extrapolate this so what you're saying is make Britain great again yes
and we do it by annexing Wakanda even though it doesn't exist all right which
some people have trouble with by the way some people do think Wakanda's real
look I have some German heritage in me I think we need to make Germany great
again let's bring it on guys Holocaust 2.0 let's go I want to I want to take
this turbo nerd a guy and ask him if Western civilization or the continents
of Africa is more advanced and watching his head explode because he won't want
to admit it anyway he says I expect this attitude from heart of darkness not
a YouTube video in 2017 are you serious it's also 2018 but whatever it's a weird
mistake and this attitude is ironic considering the film being criticized
one which extensively attempts to normalize and represent African culture
and by showing the inherent problems in this society despite its African culture
highlight that these issues are utterly human well what well a heart of darkness
is a very classic story and you read in at least high school level how that
relates to steam engines going down going down the river and she's a slave
trade maybe how this relates to dot dot dot you could say that for this entire
comment how this relates this attempts to normalize and represent African
culture and by showing the inherent problems in the society in the society
despite its African culture highlight that these issues are utterly human I
won't moving on though that if given technology these African tribes can
consider us as primitive in the same way that we view current third world nations
as primitive yeah again I guess he's I guess he's saying that if you give
advanced technology to African tribes they would consider us primitive no
they'd use it and then kill themselves they don't know how it works yeah they
would probably self-destruct yeah I may as well just keep going like I'm sorry
but there's a reason why okay no I probably shouldn't say that what were
you gonna say the African tribes are barbaric well I was going to say there's
a reason why African like the the best African countries are like only just
above like third world but then I was like that's probably not the best way to
word that there are certain places in Africa that generally don't look like
yeah there's parts of like South Africa that look modern but then you go out of
those little parts and it's like oh it's the rest of Africa now look I mean is
it really a secret Africa is not doing so hot right now are there any that opens
up that opens up arguments about how much of it is is whitey's fault in that
like that's what yeah cuz they don't have any colonialism's fault and things
were just amazing and wonderful and dandy and magical in Africa until the
white people showed up they have no agency they can't take any responsibility
for their own failings so they have to blame it on white people so it's like
okay I mean the thing is a whole discussion there's a lot of history to
go over but like why are we talking about all this sort of like take a step
back and be like I was I was just criticizing the design the ideas of this
culture and how it would have lasted so I was like no this is all because you
British these people are desperate to justify trial by combat it's so on the
viable it is very strange like I that's why when we were watching that guy's
review response movie thing video is the word I'm looking for well you're
watching his video and I was like man there's I wonder what he's gonna say I'm
sure surely he'll just skip over this part and agree with you right because
there's no way you could defend trial by combat as an effective and justifiable
political system under dictatorship is no he did never mind well alright funny
note by the way in the season seven or six of Game of Thrones I think six they
outlaw trial by combat is too primitive and barbaric and it was a kid that
outlawed it still alive it was a beautiful Aryan white kid are you saying
that are you saying they're smarter than adult black men I'm just saying there
will they have been some rules right well look I'm just saying both exposed
to it not not everything about Hitler was bad it's true well that's true the
Audubon I heard he's a good painter and he did a he did scoliosis checks he did
like animals yeah and the city beautification projects I mean not a bad
idea I wonder if he liked animals as much as Kiro the wolf anyway if we can
knock out the last bit yeah he goes on by saying mauler missing this and
criticizing the film as such is only reinforcing the importance of the
narrative he is critiquing Wow what narrative would that be mauler white
supremacy mauler missing and critiquing this film as such is only reinforcing
the importance of the narrative he is critiquing I'm confused by that he's I
think he's saying that your arguments support your argument well no he's sort
of painting a picture that there's culture there's white culture there's
thing is it is it really about white supremacy at this point because he went
through African culture and then things being primitive and well he's lumping
all of African culture together for starters and I didn't say anything
because you know these people I don't think he was doing it in a malicious way
but there's multiple you know African culture is not one thing reinforcing
the importance of the narrative from the film I'm assuming they're trying to say
which is that in the film what kind of view themselves as above other societies
because they're more advanced and and that's looked at as an issue in the film
which by the way look I'm happy to admit that's a thing in the film and I think
he's saying I missed that and it's ironic because that's my issue that I
view Western culture is above and beyond every other culture on earth because
obviously that's this person's take on my video for some fucking reason well
and first off what's wrong with that what's wrong with saying first world
countries are not culturally better than third world countries it's offensive is
that is that racist is that incorrect I mean if I would culture we chop things
off and fight each other to the death to earn the right to we're about to get
into that with the end of his comment oh so let's let's let's tackle that that
culture does not make one better or worse that spiritual beliefs are
independent of the need to build bridges as a society that no group is superior
or inferior to another group boy that is clearly gone our whoosh over maulers head
yeah no that's simply not true yeah some are superior or inferior to some
cultures some cultures are shit and I would I would not shed a tear of some
cultures in the world disappeared like what if it was a culture like
hypothetically there's a culture where it's just tradition once every week to
eat a bowl of shit juice is that is that's just not superior or inferior
that's just their culture leave them alone well there's a reason why there's
a very large rate of people going and traveling to the United States every
year as opposed to any other country in the world so maybe it's because they
like the taxes to be a certain rate I don't know maybe like arguing about
politics every day I don't know but they like going there more than everyone I
think there has to be maybe turbo nerd Oh believes in like cultural relativism
or something along those lines possibly as a recently there's been a couple of
like you know there's been a lot of because of article 13 another shit
that's going on in Britain there's been a lot of arguments like man we wish we
had your first amendment that would be nice like and you know the idea that we
kind of want a bit of your culture the idea that we consider that better than
ours you know and it's does that I'm supposed to be a supremacist for my own
culture right according to this person so why would I ever be jealous of a
culture or assume that it's better in it with a different culture at that point
wouldn't that be impossible there's nothing wrong with saying one culture
is better or worse than another based on the context of what you're evaluating
yeah obviously you can't say every single element is perfect and best but
as a whole in general in the majority yes you can totally say a first world
country or a second or third world you know is better Western civilization the
culture of Western civilization in general is way better than like the
culture of the Middle East that's just your opinion yeah you know Afghanistan
or America I guess if you ask a feminist they'll be like oh they treat people so
nice and Afghanistan I was gonna say by the way but yeah that's that's to
explain why we thought that there was a chance in the video that he was gonna
label me a white supremacist because someone in the comments came to that
conclusion but apparently that was just completely irrelevant the guy's video
and my video apparently this is the kind of thing where it's just like they
clearly had that thought well before they saw either by the or the guy
remember he'd be a parts video I guess they just wanted to say that either way
I suppose it's time for the main event which I think me what is it me and rags
the only people who know movie Bob relatively well I assume are the four of
us I didn't know he was part of the escapist I did yeah he was only recently
back with the escapist as far as I know yeah it escapist said they want to be a
political and so they hired well all I know about movie Bob is that he's
pretty much insane he says a lot of things that make absolutely no sense and
well Patrick Williams respects him so he must be good yeah he is and did say he's
a traditional reviewer movie Bob is an unironic supporter of eugenics he said
many times across the internet that we should do anything we can to prevent
Nazis from getting any kind of win that's like his goal and if that say for
example a Nazi said I love my daughter she's a wonderful person Bob would be
like killer kill the door do it you can't let them win any they're on a bad
tactics guys do anything as long as it stops the Nazis from winning and then of
course it comes down to the very sad reality that what is the criteria for
being a Nazi these days like well it's loose at this point you could you could
just you know have a cop you could say like Brie Larson should smile in the new
trailer for Captain Marvel and you'll be dangerously close to that label already
and what's interesting is that his his videos don't get that much views
especially for the escapist channel well he's been around for a long time I've
always I've known the name for a very long time and I always assumed that
anybody who's been around for long generates an audience just by virtue of
existing like for breaking I can't believe movie Bob's quality in his
videos of always baffled me that he gets anything beyond like a thousand views
so I always be like wow people really do like that but you know in fairness
let's give him a shot this is in terms of timeline Patrick Williams made his
video and it got a huge amount of backlash then movie Bob decided to
double down on it for him and this got a bunch of backlash too but he speaks fast
so we're probably gonna have to do a bit of you know reversing every once in a
while but is everybody good to go this is gonna be enlightening let me put
water in my bottle speaks fast you into thinking he's smart just like certain
other Jew I know I will read some super chats while while he's getting his drink
more did you ever get your D D rank handler license from rags sooner you get
it the sooner you can rank up I am is that directing each shows D rank in
reference to the male sexual organ guys I'm trying to be very diplomatic here
that is inappropriate we never swear or have any crude jokes on this stream so
you're gonna review or talk about the upcoming Ivan or takers last Jedi
read it I've not seen it but smud boy you right you you referenced that earlier
did you not yes I was curious when it was coming out I did not know it was
released I wish we could that'd be great Infinity War is the most expensive
anime ever made it's probably true if you consider it at a bay black panther
outsold last Jedi and this is the thing I don't even know say for example a
great Star Wars movie came out and Infinity War outsold it as far as I'm
concerned as like that might be normal at this point because I think that the
MCU somehow is actually the biggest selling franchise now instead of Star
Wars in terms of movies which is a mantle I suppose they've been trying to
earn for the past decade so they finally have it I see the bastard child of
Christy Winters and Kevin Logan is that referencing who's the guy again what's
it you remember his name right wolf the one who's making a video on you
eventually Eric something Eric tax on yeah I think that's what that's
referencing oh no well I don't know who I yeah I don't know who Christy which is
I think I know Kevin Logan is I recognize the name I know the name
Christy Winters I don't know what she looks like what I mean honestly I think
Eric tax on is more of a you know a botched clone of YMS Christy Winters is
a crazy feminist oh well Kevin Logan is a crazy feminist
those two and why are you why are you talking about them oh someone someone
asked if those two put together makes Eric tax do you say his tax and attacks
on tax on yeah Eric tax on Eric maybe terrible music but it ain't a it ain't
a compliment to say somebody's a mix of Kevin Logan and Christy Winters no I
know that ain't no compliment the last year's sale numbers aren't fully
available if I recall correctly at least in terms of home releases apparently
they're good enough right now to affirm to have made that video dude sounds
autistic to be honest kind of explains why he likes the last Jedi I mean you
don't have to be autistic to like it I would just say that you know it's
interesting to deny it might help someone said her name is Fisty
splinters get it right this one's got always remember and it I'm not even sure
here guy shouting at dog and then milk is greater than rhino milk is greater
than cow milk guy shouting at dog milk I need the meme explained not to mention
people collect movies that's yeah there's plenty like it well we did
mention it's like there's gonna be people who are buying it just because
they're like I want to have all the Star Wars movies since like did you even
like the new ones like no but I want them anyway female-led movies with high
ratings Kill Bill alien aliens Moana frozen hunger games run Lola run and so
on and so forth yeah I don't even the whole female thing is frustrating to be
honest because it's just it feels like a smokescreen these apologists are gonna
look even more stupid in a few years of Star Wars continues to sink it they'll
keep making apologist videos anyway I think at that point the narrative will
change to Star Wars fans of ruined Star Wars as opposed to the films being bad
the narrative can always shift is it bad I enjoyed solo it's definitely not the
best but it was certainly better than the Last Jedi in terms of tone only bad
part was SJ droid I see you can enjoy it it's fine it's just that I I thought the
characters plot and there's a couple of things with with with law if you will
just the the Millennium Falcon being the main one we're a lot of hits to take
what would you give it as a number wolf if you if you were forced by gunpoint to
give solo a number and number rating for how good it was yeah like out of 10 four
yeah I'd say I'd probably go with a four four sounds about right don't forget
Jumanji knocked off the Last Jedi true Jumanji was a surprise hit from what I
know right like it did really well and people didn't see it coming it was like
I've heard it was quite good yeah apparently wasn't it it is actually a
pretty good I enjoyed it I don't think it's amazing but I had fun with it it
made me laugh that's all I need hard to compare the earnings of old Star Wars
because you have to compensate for inflation how many screens did they play
and how long they were in theaters that's true as well he wants to wait
until the end of the year to talk about toys because of Christmas oh yeah I guess
that makes sense again I don't think Star Wars is gonna have a great year but
we'll see if you guys haven't finished ripping movie Bob he released a video
today revealing he doesn't understand basic plot points from the first two
predator movies if that video is available by the next time we might check
it out cuz I mean is anyone rags wolf you guys have both seen predator right
at least yeah yeah I've seen the first predator yeah okay shout out to Sean
Ranklin I don't know who that is public
public service announcement about to come into direct contact from movie Bob
everyone take your iodine pills limit exposure with frequent pauses and and
you can reduce the risk of cancer I mean I'm sure we'll make it we make it
through even the craziest of stuff bring Joseph Anderson in here I would
happily have him guess but I think he would want to not do this because it's
too crude he would he would he would be upset at the idea that we we take
reviewers to task probably in Black Panther Wakanda didn't have guns in
Infinity War their swords were now guns an odd rat combat makes no sense that
they had no guns they fired one blast from one spear in one scene in in Black
Panther and then in Infinity War they're all firing shit tons from them so I'm
guessing that it's some weird the way they edited it it almost seems as if
half well like at the very end of the movie or something some guy was like hey
wouldn't it be cool if the spear shot lasers like oh that is cool how much of
the movie do we have left so no much just put it edited on a scene later when
the Orc Society in Warhammer 4k makes more sense than the one you wrote you
have a problem agreed invites kind of invite deck a shadow for predator
installs I would be on board with that I'll see if I'll see if he's up for it
on Twitter I will I will try and get a message out Kero the wolf unbridled rage
when Bob eugenics a good ship but tell movie Bob the Last Jedi was a win for
the Nazis yeah that'll get us on get him on our side I suppose Bob get the
calipers chip man that uh that unbridled rage is on medicars channel
love love your videos and streams give a good work move what was wrong there are
no bad targets just bad shooters I work with a lot of autistics and most don't
like the Last Jedi where's the token proud I'm afraid Fringy's out today and
I'm not available but I will be trans brown there you go and who are you to
deny me my identity the last one for now do you guys like the Clone Wars TV
series so I've only seen one and a half or a little bit more seasons and so far
it's I would say meh but I'm apparently supposed to be coming to better stuff
soon I know wolf season 3 wolf is like whoo entirely with with Clone Wars I'm
not sure we rags the spud stand on this one though I haven't seen a lot of clips
yeah I haven't seen an actual episode but when I was doing research for even
now for Kotor like the power levels of the like Yoda and other compared to
other parts of the franchise like they're this is the highest as they are
like they can do some really crazy crap so I don't know if that's a good thing
because you can't just have Jedi just moving planets around but for the story
like that a Jedi is powerful and it takes a lot to get rid of them it kind
of defeats the idea of what happened in the prequels where they just knock out
Jedi like no big deal it kind of subverts that also in the original Kotor
and Kotor 2 where you can get guys who are just really sneaky to kill a Jedi so
it sort of humanized them a bit but in the animation that sort of makes them
even bigger so I think people like that they like the the super powerful Jedi
characters and that's fine mmm-hmm unless they're talking about the the
cartoon the one that had the little shorts in them I don't know I don't know
that one no generally reference the 3d yeah there's the 2d and the 3d ones the
2d ones were really good yeah they're really good yeah and yeah and Ryan
Johnson apparently named dropped you on Twitter more part of a scummy joke I
think also mommy joke maybe he's watched videos in last Jedi from what I
can tell it has nothing to do with me it's just a coincidence he's like
referencing something that uses the word molar in it and if you judge from the
the responses there's nobody there saying like oh taking a shot a youtuber
came after you or anything like that are up voted there's a lot of people just
referencing some kind of story or something so yeah I don't think it has
anything to do with me but thank you very much for all the donations are you
guys ready for movie Bob sure I don't know if I'm ready
I don't know if I'll have you have no choice
today's episode is inspired in part by a recently viral YouTube video called shut
up about plotholes from Patrick H Willems right so that is fucking that is yeah
this is why we're gonna have to do a lot of rewinding he speaks really fast and I
don't know why hero talks fast I mean holy shit I mean is this guy like trying
to sell me something well this is the thing I don't know I don't know what's
what is the point exactly but yeah we're gonna have to this is gonna be tough but
here we go I already feel like rewinding you like can you like slow it down by
like I don't think I can I hate that face is actually a viral YouTube video
called shut up about plotholes from Patrick H Willems so if you'd like a
more detailed why are we talking about this context you may want it then what's
the efap episode about shut up about plotholes yeah we've received in this
channel yeah because when you when you type in shut up about plot holes that
ours is the second thing that pops up after the first shitty video is it
definitively that or is it just because of your you remember search results do
sort of go towards your biases I know the only one that matters if you tried
in like incognito mode see if it pops up that would be interesting but do you
think he talks fast to like it make people not even realize he says
something stupid yeah even in incognito mode we are the number two results if you
type in shut up about plotholes sweet we are number three also every other
every other video is apparently shitting on shut up about plotholes there's yeah
there's very few people who fucking support it aside from chip but
apparently also if 190,000 views is viral then every video we make is viral
anyway so if you'd like a more detailed why are we talking about this context
you may want to check it out there and while you're doing that maybe check out
and make sure you're subscribed to the escapist YouTube channel and perhaps
you'd also enjoy following my YouTube channel anyway in this video will it
essentially communicates three main points in descending order that the
overwhelming majority of film criticism and or analysis video essays currently
popular on the web seem to be mostly people attempting to find funny and or
angry new ways to read off lists of quote-unquote plot holes from individual
movies that the already nebulous definition how is it nebulous it's
nebulous definition yeah it is well people first off don't even know what a
plot is let alone what a hole to apply that as a negative thing it's pretty
straightforward the right plot line hole in the line sure it depends on what you
describe a plot though and then what a plot line is or what a storyline is I
would say most people know what it is but if you ask them to define it they
might have a hard time doing it well that's what's nebulous right because
there's so many definitions and there's the same way with any literary term theme
and pacing that we have a good idea and that when you say there's a hole we're
saying yeah there's a gap in something whether it's the theme or the character
or the the motivation or what yeah it's it's we know what's something's bad we
just can't quite describe it in in the way that's classically used so I don't
really get very liturgical on these sort of ideas because you feel
something's wrong you can't quite articulate it but you know there's
something off that's all that really matters I mean like for example with my
videos if I notice that uh you know Jake Skywalker is doing something and we're
being told it's it's Luke instead of saying it's a plot hole I usually say
it's a character inconsistency I'll stick with access much clearer because
what you'll find I least find with the people who are defending the Last Jedi
in several films they usually open with people don't even know what a plot hole
is and so it's always just like does that does that completely undo their
complaint the fact that they labeled it wrong this is a shitty thing it's just
not the shitty thing you thought it was I mean not even everything that I mean me
and mauler in our videos of the Last Jedi not everything we talked about was
necessarily a plot hole so much as it was something stupid or inconsistent
exactly yeah but that's what he boils it down to is a plot hole because Bob is
not a smart person on a pair of observations I find it very difficult to
disagree with and that both of those adjacent backs have had an overall
negative effect on how we as a culture watch films and absorb and retain audio
visual entertainment I don't agree I feel like the vast majority of audiences
are enjoying films just as they always have we as a culture do this we as a
culture don't do that big broad general generalizations are just not a good
argument to make I mean if anything if anything me being more analytical about
movies made me appreciate the good movies a lot more I was about to say
that it'd probably be better if people did care more because it's not a
concept right better stories this is this is the big problem that I've noticed
with movie Bob specifically is that he will pretend like he's listening to the
opposition and arguing against them but you know obviously the easy way I could
say this is straw man but I genuinely don't even think that he has any
semblance of thinking it's a straw man like he actually is convinced that
everybody thinks everyone on the opposite side is the way that he's
portraying them in his videos and it's like you just don't listen to these
people at all you have no idea what they're actually saying you're just like
yep everybody now watches films just to point out plot holes and this is because
of I mean I'm not saying he said this but like a lot of people like this is
because of cinema sins this is because of whoever else and I just like I still
have yet to find someone who says that cinema sins is a great standard for
film criticism like have you found anyone say that I never heard it yeah
it's funny I've never heard people say that they watch cinema sins to know
whether or not a film is good the fact that cinema sins rips into every film
in existence to me sort of like isn't that evidence that they it's not like
they're actually there's not like they have actually have a standard they're
just sort of ripping everything down well they're consistently ridiculous
yeah and again I'm don't don't confuse this with me saying the cinema sins is
good content I'm not I'm just saying that uh I find it interesting how much
people blame cinema sins for everyone hating movies so yeah
as a long-term experience by training a generation of audiences that the smart
way to view narrative film is through a pedantic overly reductive lens that
grants outsized value to mechanical precision and flowchart box-checking
see but I can do the exact same argument in to him in reverse you know he says
we're say for example if he's just if he's referring to us that we're overly
reductive as in we take what is a cool idea about something we'd reduce it down
to this person walked here at this time and that doesn't make sense therefore
the idea is broken I could I could make the reverse argument to say he's he's
overly what is the opposite what is the entity or he's got very low standards or
he what's the answer to anything is there an answer let me check because I
have to store into reductive well it depends when you're talking about story
analysis you could have enhancing or enlarging yeah movie Bob enlarging well
what I'm saying is they take something that's I would actually argue sometimes
it's benign and then they make it amazing they just talk about how it's
amazing like you know like just right takes the whole dough thing and then
turns into this incredible act of storytelling when it doesn't even make
sense at the core so what they accuse us of doing I'll accuse them of doing in
reverse is when I'm getting that yeah yeah yeah pretty much yeah I don't I
thought someone anyone else was trying to say something if I've stepped in on
total welcome in regards to the structural approach to critiquing
something it doesn't have to be overly structural you could you can
minimalize every single aspect that a story needs to have and it depends on
how fine-tuned you want to take it if you're doing a drama then obviously
you're gonna focus on emotion if you're doing a space opera then you have to
focus on sensationalism and melodrama and the elements that make that franchise
or that that sub-genre work so yeah if you don't have a lightsaber battles in a
Star Wars movie that's probably not going to be one of those boxes you have
to check it's the same with the other franchises like bond is bond have a
gadget that does cool things this bond can do a car chase yes or no so that
doesn't mean you can't do that or cannot not do that but it's something you
expect because you've seen it before and you know how this is gonna play out so
unless they give you something equally good like bond is in a high car a high
speed plane chase then you're gonna be missing out on what you expect hey man
we got our we got our space war we got our battle on half we got our lightsaber
clashed in that flashback with Luke and Kylo that's enough there you go all
those boxes were checked but yeah I don't me and wolf has have this
criticism a lot that we reduce what value you can get from films while our
counter argument is that we may reduce what value you may get from certain
films but the whole goal is to appreciate the ones that did the good
job as in we get a few people going oh hey I didn't actually realize that that
was you know the case for this film sort of thing and be like yay victory and the
whole point is that we're not supposed to be running a narrative here we're
actually just trying to find what's going on in the writing for each project
obviously we'll have our biases like let's just say the new Buffy for me and
the new Lord the Rings for wolf we're probably both going in pretty pretty
much on the side of this is gonna be shit compared to what we had before but
we'll still try sure and we'll explain it in terms time we'll be like this is
the formula these are the pieces of evidence and then someone can watch it
and be like okay you were wrong you got this wrong and then we'd be like oh shit
you know or we got it right and even with our biases we still manage to pull
through but sure reductive fine importance of theme characterization
emotional connection etc and okay we're gonna have to rewind cuz fucking I'll
really reductive lens that grants outsized value to mechanical precision
and flowchart box checking while diminishing if not outright dismissing
the importance of theme characterization emotional connection
etc so themes yeah but this is the thing though I don't actually it's a meme but
like I don't think meme memes I don't think themes are worthless my point in
the video was that the themes are broken in the Last Jedi I understood what they
were going for but they the execution was horrific and the existence of themes
alone with whether or not they were executed well is not enough to just say
the movie's no good it has theme well you're talking about another very
nebulous term theme can be many things to many people characterization again not
so much nebulous but there's all these different ways you can characterize
something with setting with dialogue with the way they dress the way they
walk the way they talk yeah these are all important and if you know how to hit
those notes then you can do you can tell a story with no dialogue instead of
complete characterization in 10 seconds but obviously in context they're
talking about the theme that failure is the greatest teacher and that all of us
can take that away from the movie and realize that when we when we fall it is
an opportunity for us to you know rise in future which again concept wise that's
fine with me execution wise it's completely this conflicting elements in
the Last Jedi that confuse the hell out of me in terms of how that works for
example pose whole storyline he does the right thing at every turn and he's
completely chastised for it and apparently that was his learning curve
through failure it makes no sense at all yeah I'm not against themes either I
reference it almost every time we extreme now but the gray has a ton of
themes that are pretty subtle that make the movie way better than what it is if
you take them out and the movie does it really well unlike the Last Jedi where
it gives you all these themes and then gives you just such a horribly
contradictory broken movie that doesn't make any level of logical sense so that
the themes just don't work yeah things very inconsistent and it's interesting
where you said like we potentially outright dismiss the emotional value when
it's just like I can't tell you what you felt and I completely accept that you
would have felt potentially anything from zero to 100 in any emotion same for
me it's just that's that's a different discussion I completely accept that
that's a hundred percent valid if you want me to talk about what it made me
feel I'll happily do it but again it to me I'm just like that's a different
conversation I don't ever say that feelings aren't relevant whatsoever I
guess yeah but what we can that's the thing when you talk about emotions
versus things like plot and structure and characters and things it's it's
really hard to argue with somebody about emotions but what you can do is you can
to say all right a happens b happens c happens and we've established that
there are these rules and there are things within the film that go against
these established rules and we can point them out and in most circumstances you
can agree with people on what those things are and you can form arguments
and you can discuss and analyze those things this is of course to do with the
feeling that you have about provide well actually I think you can analyze the
feelings or the pathos of the story just as well as you can to any other I
would say I would know I I don't know I think that when you look at a more
objective criteria you know like a plot hole compared to how you felt about you
know the emotional rise you get out of a scene then that's far more I think
worthy of a discussion well to give an example maybe this if this if this helps
clear it up like canto bite if someone describes it as boring like
definitively they say like this is a boring sequence my brain immediately
says like well I found it boring but boring is like to be bored is something
that people feel therefore you can't know like there's plenty of people out
there who had been excited there's plenty of people out there who had been
scared by canto bite who knows it's really difficult you can you can then
use objective like measurements to try and explain why you felt boredom as
opposed to why everyone will feel boredom is kind of the line I suppose
we're trying to draw here yeah we're not looking at the reaction that you
personally get like you could like something I could say yeah this is a
very dramatic scene for you or I can say it's a very dramatic scene for me you're
like yeah it was it was kind of dramatic that's not that's not the pathos I'm
looking at I'm looking at the elements within the scene that we can all just
step back and remove ourselves from and say okay we know why this character is
acting the way they do we know the reason why they are feeling or they are
trying to do something that is where we can derive our own reaction from we're
not measuring our reaction we're we're looking at the characters doing their
thing so like you know the reveal for you know
Vader being Luke's father you'd be like that's easily a scene of shock and you
can you can describe that through what happens maybe the music cues the acting
you can use the extra media on top of that yeah but you like that whole that
whole scene by itself to know that someone is your dad like that just the
idea of that and then see how it looks in Luke's face yeah your reaction to
that will be holy crap but you can understand what's going through his mind
right there just by looking at it you don't have to contemplate exactly what's
going through his mind you have to invent it you can see it it's very clear
oh yeah so those those elements are completely objective we don't have to
say well I was feeling way more sad than you were that's why I think it's the
best scene ever no no no that's not what we're getting at we're getting at the
mechanical components of the composition of a scene which have the ethos logos
and pathos within them and how they they work to you believing in that scene and
what the scene is actually showing you not your your your your emotional
reaction to all this is extremely scientifically accurate or this is way
more dramatic than before or whatever no no no it's just the actual as we're
looking at I agree because I think what he's what he's doing here is trying to
imply that you cannot argue those things mechanically and yeah that's very strange
to me yeah observation I also find it very difficult to disagree with because
I can't find any reason to yeah another recent essay released a week prior by
Lindsay Ellis a negative but thoughtful review of the live-action remake of
Beauty and the Beast you're that negative but thoughtful I'm sure that me
and wolf could never fall into that category no negativity these are
gentleman negative but thoughtful so question does anybody critique is by
default not thoughtful have you noticed he's been putting up the title and then
the YouTube link as if anyone's gonna type out that YouTube link as opposed to
just the title like maybe it's got a hyperlink or something in the description
that makes it well you can't have annotations now I don't think there's
any way to actually do that other than the little things that pop them in the
top right but I'm gonna have can you have like that many in that amount of
time I don't know can you imagine like how shitty it must feel to get a shout
out from movie Bob hey man Patrick Willems must have felt great cuz he
shouted right back out I guess express some of the same sentiment in its
digital context that popular cultures pop hole fixation has reached the point
of making films themselves worse by encouraging filmmakers to craft
narratives more concerned with responding to or heading off criticism
by mechanics that's not true the idea that we've gotten so obsessed with
mechanical consistency that films are now bad because they're trying to be
mechanically consistent that's not a reality we're in yeah I don't know
where he's pulling that from I'm interested to I don't know it's like
he's reducing every piece of criticism and he's just putting it into this one
box and we've it's hard enough to understand with this fucker saying
because he's saying it so fast we did it this year's been pretty bad for
logically consistent storytelling like this year's been awful so the idea that
it's creeping up now and costing movies their quality is ridiculous and yeah
that's the false dichotomy that I'm just right brought to us which was if you
you know you should be focusing on the emotional resonance rather than logical
consistency ignoring the fact that many people get emotional resonance from
logical consistency
but yes we same sentiment in this did yeah we'll we'll see original context
that popular cultures current plot hole fixation has reached the point of making
films themselves worse by encouraging filmmakers to craft narratives more
concerned with responding to or heading off criticism by mechanics obsessed
trope fixated YouTube critics rather than see I don't I yeah I don't buy the idea
that if audiences want coherent plots and storylines and you know the logical
progression of things in a film like I don't think that that makes films worse
if anything it exposes bad writing I don't I don't buy that I don't buy that
if audiences have higher standards for films than films get worse yeah I know
it's it's again not understanding what plot is I don't again I wish I knew he
defined his terms of what a plot is and what a plot hole is then we can say okay
now now we know what the audience is learning about because there's all these
crazy critics that are looking at plot holes and making it a big deal that
suddenly the the scriptwriter is not gonna say oh I better start making my
my science fiction story be logically consistent and have all this lore that
matches up in the next story that's a good thing this is always going to be a
good thing and to neglect that is to neglect an entire component of the human
experience especially in oral or written tradition you don't want to start
telling a mystery story or even a child story a horror story to scare them to
going to sleep you don't want to start screwing up how the the magic monster
doesn't work anymore I was like wait a second do you at night at 6 o'clock you
said 5 o'clock you want to know what the hell you're talking about you have to
keep these memories alive you can't just start making crap up and when we go case
by case for these things because they always just blanket it they're like oh
my god you're obsessed with all this logical stuff when let's be honest if
you fixed it all it would just be like the film would be ruined and I'm always
just like case by case you make all these small tweaks like when someone
literally just makes the mistake of reading something out wrong in the film
or they say 13 when later they say 21 as a recognition of how many things there
are in a thing that matters you should be like literally just tweak that back
to the correct number or don't have that reference there or do this there like
tiny things and then people are just like you know you've ruined the whole
film and how strange is it that for two things one it's almost as if he's saying
he talks a fucking I didn't quite catch it but I'll remind in a second but I
think he refers to YouTube critics as like a like a derogatory term because
ironic considering movie Bob is a YouTube critic he focuses on a right
stuff while we focus on the wrong stuff okay and it's strange that movie critics
seem to be the ones who are excusing bad shit in movies the most when you would
expect them to be the ones calling it out the most it's is there it's like
they want these movies to be good is the vibe that I get is like they really
want these movies to be good which is why we get shit like rhino milk yes
think filmmakers to craft narratives more concerned with responding to or
heading off criticism by mechanics obsessed trope fixated YouTube critics
rather than delivering a satisfying and lasting experience oh man that's so
annoying to you rather than delivering a lasting and satisfying experience as if
the you know do I need to say false dichotomy it's just like that's it there
you go I yeah I'm curious how the Last Jedi is gonna last you know in terms of
it's um it's timeless appeal I just I don't see it I don't see the timeless
appeal in the Last Jedi it might be talked about forever if that way it's
timeless but not for yeah it's infamously timeless we should just throw away all
the Sherlock Holmes stories yeah you know just all the logic just no one's
gonna read these ever again it's it's this is what I mean it's just like way
way to just completely misrepresent the other side as if because movie buffs got
videos I've heard I haven't seen them apparently in relation to Bama vs.
Superman he's got videos where he breaks them down logically and it's just like the
just just right had the same problem where you just show them their own work
show them that it bothered them and then they're like yeah but that's
different because reasons because this didn't have Star Wars on the cover yeah
yeah sure I was just gonna say there's like that conclusion that um it doesn't
last with you as much if you make it logically consistent which fixated
YouTube critics rather than delivering a satisfying and lasting experience now
for me apart from again largely agreeing with all of that the core of the issue
does seem to start with the weakening the definition of what he sees it's this
center of the earth that's the core I got it I got it this editing style is
giving me an aneurysm I don't like it either I hate it it's like image image
image image image in granted people might look at this and say this isn't
we're not criticizing the substance of his is what you could stretch and say
arguments but it's just an it's annoying to look at it's very is like if I had
been doing editing as long as he's been doing editing I would be like upset with
this I mean I it's genuinely hard to listen to and to look out I mean so
visually unappealing and on top of that the fact that he's speaking at like a
thousand words a second I mean it's it's ridiculous well you tell me I gotta take
a breath when I'm in in my own videos and I'm like oh my god I can't even
follow this guy I'm not a fan of his style to edit but his style is nowhere
near as bad as his arguments for me like I get way more distracted by listening
to movie Bob you're just going like oh my god what now I genuinely have a
headache after watching only about a minute of this so what's interesting is
we watched a video I forget who it was by but they were talking about things
and then on the screen there were there was text of different things God hello
Greedo yeah I'm pretty sure it actually was because I was the one where he was
like complaining about people hating Star Wars and then he was like oh you
guys it doesn't matter if Ray's a Mary Sue or not and it was it's like one of
those tests that they give people where they have a word written out in the
color but they say say the color of the word not what the word says and the
words spell colors things like that it was like I don't know what I'm supposed
to folk what am I supposed to listen to you or read to the different texts that
you want you want me to absorb two things at the same time that are
different as I say movie Bob man and it's like I I just spent a bunch of
money on new art assets and stuff and I got Vegas and I'm learning how to do
zooms and scrolls and panning and how timing works and all that stuff and like
improving slowly but surely my you know the style and everything but this is
just like you know a transparent image transparent image transparent image as
fast as it talks it must be judging him mechanically judge him emotionally from
I'm judging him based off of the other piece of shit things he does it's just
that the the editing is oh geez it's it's hard to it's almost like if I close my
eyes it's better but then I have to see the button so largely agreeing with all
of that the core of the issue does seem to start with the weakening the
definition of what a plot hole even is having devolved from this thing that
happened does not make any sense to this thing that happened does not make any
sense to me see yeah he's just labeled if you call something a plot hole then
it's just because it doesn't make sense to you well it's like the Chris Nolan
fanboy you just didn't understand well remember Patrick was like just because
you didn't see Bruce Wayne with no money or resources or contacts get to what was
essentially a completely guarded Gotham that's not a plot hole montage answers
that no it doesn't it was not a month knowing so he's like that's not a plot
hole that is an example of you thinking you know what a plot hole means but you
don't yeah and if anything else all that does is it just kicks the can down the
road to it being in a different category of problem it's like it's not a plot
hole it's just a different problem it's frustrating because he's not helping the
conversation is he what he just did there was essentially just thrown in
salt well he told you what you think yeah people don't know the definition
therefore well even if they don't know the definition they know something is
wrong with they saw and they can't articulate it well enough and he's being
actually mechanical and kind of semantic on this point which is odd because again
he doesn't believe in those things but that's fine fine teach us how we should
use the term or use a different term great we're still gonna complain we're
still gonna have problems now we can have a better vocabulary do you remember
when Patrick Williams was like people don't know what the definition of plot
hole is and then like immediately after he says this is what it means as far as
I know or something like that he like says this is what it means to be or
something it was just like wait but even that's good because you always define you
define your term my problem is that he's saying it's like other people's
definitions are wrong my source for my definition is me it's like what and then
and then he says that you can find plot holes in anything I don't know I can
appreciate Patrick Willem at least saying that this is what I think a plot
hole is so that at least we can like peer to his raised mind yeah Bob has
failed to do that yet but maybe maybe he does who knows maybe part of the reason
plot hole or movie mistake hunting became popular in the video essay world
is because it feels like an easy shortcut to doing deep and or serious
analysis because it lets you do a comprehensive breakdown of a film okay
Bob tell me what deep analysis is I want to know what this movie mistake
hunting is it's the same thing if he's saying one or the other it's like okay
we can do one or the other just fine great let's do both the mistake hunting
is like a super reductive version of criticism not to mention he must that's
not like he's saying that in quotations right because if he's actually saying
this is hunting mistakes it would be like so they're mistakes yeah like he
must be saying that in quotations because he doesn't consider them actual
mistakes I guess we'll give that another listen because you know part of the
movie plot hole or movie mistake hunting became popular in the video essay world
is because it feels like an easy shortcut to doing deep and or serious
analysis yeah my my only question is tell me what deep analysis is then yeah
what exactly do you want us to do he hasn't told us what plot hole is yet
either but we'll just keep adding these to the ticket all right he's he's are you
gonna be the one to decide what's legitimate criticism and what isn't
legitimate criticism Bob are you I know that Bob is the he's the perfect person
he's the perfect authoritarian who would say I'm gonna be the one who decides
what is and isn't criticism and what is and isn't upon all not to pick at it but
this guy he's got the date wrong as well a veg is infinitesimal 2017 Oh damn
Bob I get that research done that's a plot hole if if he's spent less time
looking for a transparent JPEGs oh sorry so it actually said the literally that
I feel bad now anyway because it lets you do a comprehensive breakdown of a
film without the hard parts of having to establish a thesis or arrive at a
unifying ultimate point why do we need a thesis to make observations yeah I'm
not sure again I'd love him to develop that cuz what is what is he looking for
for us to establish at the beginning in terms of a thesis when judging a movie
that we are here today to define whether or not this was constructed well by the
standard of and then provide references is that the kind of looking for is he
looking something much simple now I haven't taken a writing class in a long
time because you know I got a job but isn't a thesis at the beginning that
basically makes your position clear from the start so if you're making a movie
criticism it almost feels like you shouldn't have one that you should end
with something like that you shouldn't I don't know that he's treating the
video like it's an essay like you know like when I do my plot analysis I'm not
doing an essay format I'm just saying this is what happens this is what
happens and this is what happens during that time things could could have been
told well or told poorly or told absolutely horribly wrong that's it it's
just like it's like driving your car there were potholes on the road and I
hit ten of them and it was really bad that's it just just correct me if I'm
wrong cuz again I always look for definitions of words just to clarify but
the second definition of thesis according to Google is a long essay or
dissertation involving personal research written by a candidate for a university
degree sure so could we extrapolate the literally just writing an essay about a
movie is automatically a thesis statement doing the essay style well the
first is the first definition is a statement or theory that is put forward
as a premise to be maintained or proved so if my premise was the Last Jedi is
bad and then I move on to explain plot holes and other things that thesis would
be that the Last Jedi you think correct me if I'm wrong but most videos
deconstructing the Last Jedi open with that statement this film is bad let me
move so he's wrong on the thesis part what was the other I just want to hear
what the other thing is because it lets you do a comprehensive breakdown of a
film without the hard parts of having to establish a thesis or arrive at a
unifying ultimate point a movie Bob does the real work you don't need to do any
of that all you're doing is watching them be or playing the game or listening
to the music and going hey something's feel I don't even know what is wrong
something feels wrong something doesn't sound right I don't know what the feeling
is I'm getting but there's some inconsistency with what I just
experienced that's all you have to do I think what these people want to do is
they want to try and elevate what they do to this really really high kind of
pedestal maybe that's because you get I get that impression from these people
that what they do is some some kind of a some can some holy thing some
extremely high refined art form and I'm not saying it can't be it's just that
they they have to elevate everything they do to this level even when it makes
it seem pretentious and unnecessary speaking of pretentious and unnecessary
can anyone tell me what a unifying alternate point is I can we do we do
critical analysis the whole point for me at least is to find meaning in whatever
we're looking at so we've tried to find the meaning of a scene which might be
broken or it might be hidden and that's the that's the process we have to
develop we have to go through we have to read it we watch it we have to think
about it we have to come back to it so if there isn't any meaning we say hey
you know here this is a this is a flaccid piece of nothing that's it
that's the point that's what we've discovered if we find that there's
layers and layers of something that works on a dramatic level that works on
a scientific level logically whatever then we like wow look at all this stuff
and we if we just pay attention and listen maybe to foreshadowing previously
or to the big reveal we could have seen it coming we could have experienced it
more we've could have appreciated the writers work more if they're of course
there's something there to to deduce but we have not he said he said alternate
unifying point unifying alternate point was the order I'm not sure that I
suggest is he trying to say that you go with the thesis or premise that last
year is bad and then you go through all the elements and you basically start
stacking up all the good things like as you progress almost like you lost your
narrative and then the unifying alternate point would be that the last
one is actually great would that be what he means by that I wish I could say I
don't know exactly I don't know what though I don't know what he means by
alternate unifying unifying it sounds like he wants to teach a course in in
short story writing or something and it's one of those really weird electives
you take at university that no one really wants to go to and you're like
oh this guy he's got some some deep meaning behind he's definitely saying
words I'll give him that he's saying words yeah words are being spoken many
of them very quickly but I I don't know what it means
hence the breakdown of a film without the hard parts of having to establish a
thesis or arrive at a unifying ultimate point because no this thing you thought
was good actually has several imperfections and therefore you are wrong
and it's not good does not count as a point why not why but pointing out
errors to something that contradict your thesis I don't see why that wouldn't are
we actually gonna be arguing over what the definition of a point is now like
really if someone says the Last Jedi is good in terms of filmmaking and
consistent writing and then I present them all these pieces of evidence and I
say you are wrong I would have made my point it's too generic to say what good
means if you can define a scene or a good composition or a good like the
purpose of the story is X and therefore it did X then you could say great okay
it accomplished its goal it did it in a horribly broken way it still accomplished
its goal then sure it's great it's a great film it did exactly what it set
out to do with premise was maintained it achieved it great but is that what
we're going for I don't think so I think we're going for the package at the
entire experience and we're seeing any drama we're seeing any logical we're
seeing any any enthusiastic aspect that we wanted to see like oh we were waiting
to see this fight scene it came and we got it and we're so satisfied is that
the subjective thing we're looking for I don't know what's he talking about here
and to clarify he just said that so you have person a saying the film's great
person B saying is evidence you're wrong and he and he's saying that's not a
point and if you think it is you're wrong it's like well movie Bob did did
you just not make a point like how far does this go we just say nothing is a
point now the more he talks the more I get the impression that it's just he's
trying to set it up as well when I make the point then it's this grandiose
underlying thematic substantive gobbledygook whatever you want to call it
and it's deeper and it transcends all of the points that you make maybe maybe I
mean that's kind of strange because you want to supersede other meaning you've
discovered unless it's part of it's like it's a secondary aspect of the main
component also see it's kind of a great video sorry I'll let you do it's just a
sign of a great video that we spend this long figuring out what he's trying to
say first exactly I don't yeah a lot of this is interpretation like maybe we're
completely wrong because we have no idea what he's saying because like I still
like what is alternative unifying point
I mean I am genuinely serious when I say that I have a headache and I it's hard
for me to even pay attention to this video at this point just close your eyes
and that's what I've been doing I've just had like my head in my hand do you
want to do I just run through it so we don't you don't have to spend so much
time analyzing this thing there's so much that we know that's what we do
this fucking podcast is called every frame a pot because this is what we deal
with also I did I did interrupt you by the way if you wanted to make a point
about before I said that this video makes no sense by the way let's just keep
going we're good yeah okay well imperfections and therefore you are wrong
and it's not good does not count as a point but even easier than that is being
able to pad out your list of problems with things that only feel mistaken
logically inconsistent confusing or dumb to you rather than take the due
diligence and frankly healthy degree of introspection to check and see whether
you're this is so fucking pretentious I agree with him though but he's he's
saying this is a counter to last Jedi haters you know like it like you know
the idea that someone says oh the last Jedi sucks because I hated what they
did with Han Solo in it you'd be like he wasn't in the film and then you they go
hey was and you're like no you've gotten that wrong right that's that's
great when you actually tell somebody to check their references as he's
implying right here but the problem is just lump those people in with people
complaining about the last Jedi as if the last Jedi doesn't have problems it's
like he's arguing our subjective analysis is gonna be wrong for whatever
reasons let's find out what he thinks is actually right but like yeah he's
instantly assuming that you're wrong if you take the other position well I
suppose so but it's almost he can he won't give benefit of the doubt and he
won't even like entertain the idea it's it's just this it's a very it only in
the most broadest sense of what he's saying is it true but it's very obvious
by the way that he's phrasing it and based on what he said previously in this
video that he's absolutely looking down on the people who would disagree about
this kind of thing yeah and why not provide counter arguments to these
references instead of simply saying yeah you guys you've got it wrong but like I
said in concept I agree with him if people are saying there are problems
with they've simply got bad information that's fine my problem is the context in
which he's presented this he's implying that people who look for plot holes
typically get it wrong and that they're not actually plot holes at all with no
references at least at least Patrick actually gave references they were bad
references but he gave their shit yeah but they existed perception is actually
correct but while I'm inclined to agree that the way it encourages us to
prioritize plot mechanics and structure over theme and impact is a much more
damaging aspect like that's what impact see we hear again impact imply I like
that I like how he said that we put a plot and whatever above theme it's like
you have to put it above theme we have to have plot first yeah once you have
plot everything else comes from it that's how it works I would say that if
you're making a movie and you're like if you're a director and you make a movie
that has solid plot characters all that good stuff and you have you you don't
think about theme you have no concept of theme you don't make the movie intending
for people to get a theme from it people will still get a theme from it
themes are that malleable you can they're they're so they're nebulous and
out there that even if you don't put a theme in your film there will be a theme
in your film that people will draw from it right in this case he has to define
what's so important about theme because if he doesn't do that we're like oh we
should pay attention to theme okay Bob what is that he's asserted that themes
are extremely important and I'm like yeah I like me a good theme I preferred
not to invent one and it's consistent element with like in reference to the
plot or the characters to cover up a films like horrific writing but there we
are this whole thing jumps from obsessive nit picking for its own sake
is shallow to the point of meaningless as an act of film criticism to oh my god
stop it you are literally murdering the concept of culture I feel like an
under the same what let's let's do that again cuz what that's where this whole
thing jumps from obsessive nitpicking for its own sake is shallow to the point
of meaningless as an active film criticism to oh my god stop it you are
literally murdering the concept of culture so it goes from your nitpick so
much that you're actually hurting culture I don't think those were two
extremes or two negative sides you know I think that's what he's saying it
starts as nitpickery and it moves into actual damage to culture well yeah that
well yeah that's why criticism of Black Panther eventually leads to the white
ethno state not to mention since cinema sins culture has just taken a dive
cinema sins ruined everything we used to have good movies but now we only have
movies that pay attention to logical consistency that's a thing darned curse
you cinema sins for doing that how awful of you I can't it like I wonder if you'll
qualify this cuz that is a crazy statement but again movie Bob so oh my
god stop it you are literally murdering the concept of culture I feel like an
under-discussed aspect is also how the otherwise neutrally mal nutritious fact
I'm already gonna have to listen to that again
yeah I didn't follow that at all he just speaks so fast and jumps from one thing
to another so quickly it's it's borderline impossible to follow this video
impossible for us to like we have to turn his video from nine minutes into
something just to hear him yeah this is nine minutes of video but it's like 40
minutes of actual gobbledygook that he spew in so let's let's see if we can
derive some meaning oh my god stop it you are literally Williams but I'll at
least say thanks for being relatively cool yeah thanks for speaking like a
normal human being and the style the style is easy on the eyes for the most
part Patrick Williams yeah thanks for at least almost being coherent anywhere
this is um to oh my god stop it you are literally murdering the concept of
culture I neutrally mal nutritious away I didn't hear it let me play okay murdering
let's give this culture I feel culture I feel like an under-discussed aspect is
also how the otherwise neutrally mal nutritious fact of plot hole recitation
masquerading as substantive critique gets weaponized to make the subjective
a pic fuck dude no I can't okay so what he's saying is that he doesn't like
people who point out plot holes that's all that's that's that's basically yeah
he's saying that pointing out plot holes is essentially like it's it's a cheap
way to subjectively say you don't like something even if you can objectively
point out an objective error with the film yeah there's no value to which
those exist everyone by the way I have never seen such a ridiculous example of
word salad in my life I mean legit did not understand it I have listened to it
three times now this is insane it's not necessarily bombastic and quick for no
reason aside from he wants like if you compare all the nonsense allegories
from a razor fist video with just some rambling bullshit from a Jordan
Peterson video it then amplified it by like a hundred and fifty and yet it is
it is over extravagantly loquacious I see what you did there right
this is also like a normal person it's inside like a normal person to people
just simple concepts well even complex compass explain it in a simple
terms man why do you need these crazy words and then say he never actually
took a creative writing course so well that's just creative writing is just a
nitpick or something sure I feel like an under-discussed aspect is also how the
otherwise neutrally malnutrition fact of plot hole recitation masquerading as
substantive critique gets weaponized to make the subjective opinion sound like
objective fact for good or ill okay with that ending bit I'm just gonna take that
as people have feelings and they use plot holes to define their feelings as
factual experiences for everybody and I'm not concerned with the way they feel
about them so much as is the plot hole that they mentioned a plot hole exactly
that's that's usually me what all of our work is usually can you just accept that
it exists I don't care how you feel about it yeah that's not how the plot
works unfortunately yeah essentially if you we can both agree that a plot hole
exists in the film it's okay if you like the film but can we agree that the thing
we're pointing out this this thing in the film that we can both point to at
you know XX time such character does such or event happens and we at least
agree on that and you can like it if you want but let's just come to agreement
that the thing you know is what it is yeah and this is the thing um I would
partially actually use what what he just said I would use as an argument against
people like just right I would say that they really enjoyed the film and so
they've invented or completely shifted the narrative or the reality of the film
in order to argue that it's got an inmate like an incredible construction so
they're arguing their feelings as factual information on screen which
they've lied about but you can you don't need to just say it you can
actually show it you can go okay so just right when you when you reference the
Holdo scene and then you talk to him and then you could see what happens you
don't have to just say that they're wrong you can actually show that they're
wrong it makes it have more substance but obviously when you're speaking this
fast I don't think you can shove anybody else's references in here alongside it
would just be chaos oh dear good or ill the overriding concern here is after all
less movie reviews video essays criticism whatever as entities in and of
themselves and their function is rhetorical ammunition in debate and
discussion I failed to understand worth remembering is that nerd culture emerges
from the field of academia engineering technology mathematics the hard sciences
etc I'll say this though Donald Duck in mathematical land was amazing
those of you haven't seen it did you know that all culture involves math and
science and technology but cartoons and colors and shapes and visual cues and
audio cues no it's all all the sciences all the stem cells and in debate and
discussion I failed to understand worth remembering is that nerd culture emerges
from the field of academia engineering technology mathematics the hard
sciences etc where academic debates have clear parameters and empirical
conclusions and geek culture is when you get right down to it but for fake things
oh come give me a break come on so there's no standards there's no empirical
data in any way for scripts writing anything nerds are ex geeks or why are
you giving me like is this crap he's saying he's saying that he's a nerd and
he's super intelligent and smart because his kind of geek or a nerdery it's the
same thing but when he does it it's it's a nerdery so it comes from mathematics
and the hard sciences but when other people do it it's geekery which is
different next level levels of how great I am because I'm not from group a the
fucking post hoc shit people do for the fucking last Jedi is insane but you are
right though probably it just brings it to the surface oh my god you're stood
that no matter how serious you could get yourself to take it the fact that
there couldn't ever actually be a true empirical conclusion to debates like is
Superman stronger than Captain Marvel or Picard versus Kirk was what they could
be it depends on what information we have yeah you can make I mean like I know it
sounds a little like anal but you can measure force force is a thing that can
be scientifically measured so the one of the other is we do that well you're
referring to midichlorians for cooking for card I mean are you I'm sure
arguments can be made depending on the scenario but it's just like those are
wow those are what do you think happens when you do these things like you go
Wolverine versus Hawkeye you go well Wolverine because anything Hawkeye does
won't be permanent well this discussion he just brought up I mean yeah you can
talk about that there's a channel called the character battles between each
other and they look at the math and the science and the believability of it but
this is a total non sequitur he's just rambling on topic this is non sequitur the
video yeah I'm not sure how this assists his point really but I suppose the
overall point is that you cannot distill media or art down to a scientific level
like you can with science math whatever else so now is objective criteria bad or
I don't I don't understand is it good or bad well I guess the news he did
highlight that it's possible but now he's kind of saying that you can't do it
really he chose odd examples like is one character better than another you know
what is it what do you mean by better in what sense but I mean you it's just it's
a different thing to say can you find out objectively if this is a plot hole
or not which generally you probably can and is Kirk or are is Kirk or Picard
better like those are two comparable things that you could reach a conclusion
with using the same thought process and yeah I'm curious like what a fistfight
or in a logical debate on what should be done about X Y & Z like yeah I don't
like it cuz listening to him it makes me feel like what are you saying that the
conversation should just start and end the moment you bring it up you'd be
like well there's no way to know so give it up it's like well we do have actual
things to reference here we have facts about them we have we have events and
choices they've made these are things that happened they are definitive he's
implying is like no this is about as much substance in that as deciding
whether or not a ghost would win in a battle with a vampire it's like
there are actually a true empirical conclusion to debates like is Superman
stronger than Captain Marvel or Picard versus Kirk was part of the fun of doing
it it is Kirk though it's Kirk James Tiberius Kirk it was he's saying the
fact that you can't get an answer is why it's it's fun I think it's it's the
process is fun yeah I would agree with that but there's several examples where
you can get a conclusion like I said there are just some that are just
definitively like oh well yeah that person would win with what we know facts
wise I suppose we'll never know empirically because we can't have them
battle in real life is that his point I mean it depends you would have to
assuming that you can have true false premises then maybe that's the case
like if if there was like in cannon objective measurements of strength or
something like that then you could use those and come to a conclusion but yeah
if he's trying to argue that lore is bad and focusing on all the details is bad
because you're not focusing on I can see where he might be going but there's
nothing wrong with what would who would win in a battle what would what would
happen if these two starships from different lore came together there's
nothing wrong with that there's nothing wrong with experimenting and having fun
with with culture that you've he's not saying there's anything wrong with it
you're saying you can't get an empirical answer so what and yeah and the thing is
like there is a right answer but whether or not you can reach it yeah that's a
different thing we need we'd need more information in the in the scenario where
we couldn't get the answer for example like you know what's stronger vibranium
or adamantium it's like well we need to ask the writers if there's no reference
or look at what they can do and what their limits are you'd be like there is
no answer to that empirically it's like well no there would be if we had the
information we need to get the empirical answer because there is an answer one of
them they're not exactly the same imagine there's just a scientist in one
of the movies who says vibranium I've never heard of it I've only worked with
adamantium and then they go oh it's twice as strong as adamantium then we
have our answer because that that's officially a rule now because a
scientist said it in the universe meaning they would have researched it do
you know because scientists had a moment of weakness I don't know if this
is kind of like an argument for it's not empirical in our universe because it's
fictional but you can get an empirical answer from the fiction if that makes
sense like its own yeah it's it's a it's a true false premise it's basically if
you take a fictional world there are true things that exist within a fictional
premises you follow that smut boy or you got any different kind of take on it I
want to know where he's going with it first off because he sounds as if it's
this is impossible to achieve and it's like well it's not impossible if you
read all the lore or you have access to all the lore but I want to know where
he's going with this because what's his point doing it it is Kirk though it's
Kirk James Tiberius Kirk it just is but now it feels like a growing segment of
geek culture believes or wants to make itself believe that subjective opinion
on art entertainment fiction etc can be empirically settled with a correct
answer if only the almighty algorithm can be supplied with enough hard data
and thus upon definition defeats itself if it's subjective yeah he started false
premise there's like you can prove your subjective thing to be factual it's like
but they're two different things yeah but then it's not objective we're not
trying to argue from a subjective object of perspective we are starting with
objective observation and we're saying this is what's going on right now I'm
seeing it I'm hearing it and this the next scene this is what's going on
that's all we're doing and then we're taking a step back and we wait a second
why did that happen that's not what the guy wanted to do in the first part of
the movie he wanted to go to X why is he going to Y that's a plot hole that's
exactly what we observe and then he comes back with you're just arguing your
feelings and you'd be like that's not my feelings well I mean I guess I could
feel it but it's also true yes no he he's going to effectively true yeah
because he was this whole spiel on how you can never know enough to know what
is you know Kirk versus Spock or whatever like okay well yes you can and
it's all observable and it's not our opinion that's just what the lore is
telling us this is what the fiction is telling us so what's your argument it's
not possible we know it's possible it's not our it's not a subjective
interpretation we're listing the damn frickin movie it's what they saw the
movie told us making up and our subjective opinions can reflect an
objective truth exactly yeah it's not true because we think it is it's just
we have the correct basically the correct opinion about something that's
objectively true I think that's that's actually tied to where all this
confusion comes from the idea that you could never feel something that's
definitively a fact because it's important because basically like you
know you know I don't need to tell you that I feel like water is wet you'd be
like yeah water isn't wet first off but here here's a good here's a good
explanation all right I feel that 2 plus 2 equals 4 but it's not true because I
feel it those things just happen to both align together yeah and when we
present it to him in an argument we don't say we don't start with I felt
that character should have gone to X because they said they're going to X we
go character said they were going to X and then they went to Y respond to this
please and then they go that's just how you feel you go that's I haven't
presented my feelings yes I haven't told you how I felt yeah I could feel that
that's the case I could feel completely differently I'm asking you to respond
yeah like I could have no problem with this personally that's actually yeah
the something that a lot of people miss is like half the well not half half the
tiny complaints that meal wolf may have in movies they have no idea whether or
not it actually bothers the shit out of us or not it's just stuff that we can
pick up we could be like oh this is something that they made a mistake with
this is something that ends up yeah and you might not have noticed it but your
brain did and displaying the fact that it happened does not tell you what we
felt about it definitively unless we say it as I suppose that's it's all about
communication I suppose you know defining your terms and then letting
people know the differences or you could just say a bunch of things in a row and
hope that the audience can pick it up for themselves I suppose
those are the empirical data points like X number of plot holes or over in the
land of video games polygon counts rendering speed CPU schematics etc are
granted outsized credence over the macro questions of overall experience and how
did the store how couldn't that's two different conversations though yeah
those are two does he is he's just saying a lot of stuff right now it do not
there are words he's very like you go let's say for example someone's like let
me report on the technological achievements of the ps4 and spider-man
the new game that came out on it and they talk about the graphics the the the
port if it if it was one let's say it was originally a PC game or something I
got ported and he's talking about the the optimization then it then it goes
through all the different features you've got for controls all this
objective stuff and then he says right at the end to be honest guys you know I
played it and I loved it I thought it was amazing I thought it was a great
representation of what's in the comics I really enjoyed myself and to be honest I
think I'll be playing this game through again it's like you know there's a
switch between I displayed all these facts for you and now I'm gonna talk
about how it made me feel and he's just treated as if like you choose one and
you diminish doesn't mean they can't interact in any way it's just that
they're kind of two different conversations like you can say
spider-man runs at 30 FPS this you know objectively you could say I don't I
don't know if it I assume it is because it's on a fucking console but let's say
spider-man runs at 30 frames per second so if I was to play that game that would
bug me and that would take away my enjoyment so you can have two things
that are parallel but they're different it's objective that the game runs at 30
FPS it is subjective that it bothered me well it's objective that it did bother
me but that's you know how I felt about it then that gets two different things
too but you see the point I'm getting yeah this I just feel like he's blending
them by design here like like he wants to blend them just to make this more
confusing it is a strange way he's combined them
etc are granted outsized credence over the macro questions but that's the key
point he says they're granted outside credence they're granted outside credence
the technical stuff is granted the experience the audience has is always
gonna be subjective exactly but you can observe that these things are
objective but we're talking about apples and oranges here so I don't know why he's
bother he says it like it's the thing he said it like it's wrong if I'm to get
this right I haven't checked the words yet granting outside credence as in
something has relevance outside of experience is that what he's trying to
because I I would say that's true the objective stuff is the stuff that we can
all see here and understand and talk about means while the subject of stuff
is you know all four of us would have reacted differently to the Last Jedi it
would have been very close probably but it would have all been different if you
could scale emotions we'd all be completely different let's imagine that
this this new spider-man film has polygon count for the character 10 frames
per second you know 32-bit graphics palette you know very low low-tech stuff
would that lose the immersion I don't think so if the whole world is presented
that way and we believe in the world who cares what it looks like realistically
or believably or photorealistically that's the experience we wanted that's
what we got as we're watching through we're still watching through it we put
we play to the end we've had this experience we can play with that willing
suspension of disbelief in our head just fine regardless of the technical
achievement of the game it's some people yeah I don't know it's just one of
those things where if you say hey this game runs at 10 frames per second and
that's objective and some people can say I'm fine with that and most people would
probably say that's this is unplayable I can't I can't play this game like that
but those are two different things that are running side-by-side to each other
yeah and the key is being able to identify one
out of experience yes or no yeah that's for everybody to say isn't it sure
they can all everyone has a different reaction because he said granted
outside credence to me I'm just like it should be they're separate things you
can obviously say that the reason you felt bored in canto bite was because you
weren't interested in any of the things that were going on there like that you
know you explain you try to explain your feelings with with as many facts as you
can gather to try and correlate but again they're still just there's a line
drawn between the things that actually happen another this is how you felt
about them and outside credence I'm not entirely sure what he's trying to say
that but yes they should be separated because they are separate simple as that
of overall experience and how did the story tone aesthetic affect you on an
emotional or visceral level and that awkwardly skew prioritizing leaves a lot
of room open for a plot hole dumps being least ostensibly lists of matter of fact
you know feeling he tried to tie in some sort of subjective interpretation then
to say that because it's subjective and then we throw in our interpretation of
what a plot hole is or making observations of plot hole that this is
somehow bad like what what do you think also as right you said feelings are for
SJWs like that's a pretty titanic straw man movie Bob I've never I've never
heard any anti SJW say you shouldn't feel things do we how do we respond to
that one yeah we value feelings sir I could assure you feelings are important
yeah it's a very strange honestly that was a lot of gibberish yes during speed
CPU schematics etc are granted outsized credence over the macro questions of
overall experience and how did the story tone aesthetic affect you on an
emotional or visceral level and that awkwardly skew prioritizing leaves a lot
of room open for plot hole dumps being at least ostensibly lists of matter of
fact observation to be undeservedly held up as determinant of a work being
seriously flawed for want of more substantial criticism okay okay it's no
now it makes sense now he's saying you know there's this whole wonderful
emotional experience then there's also this this mental logical observational
and that they're they're in conflict with each other and we can't it's like
okay it's like if they if they're in conflict to you I guess yeah man that's
that's fucking that's a shame man like all right but man that what a fucking
shame yeah it's like it's like Patrick just lost his left hemisphere against
the same condition it's like oh logic what's that I don't want the logic in my
stories why I hate this idea that logic is the enemy to emotion it's like yeah
man to me they go hand in hand so well because I mean I I watched um I watched
the witch earlier this week and I really really liked it in part because
of how like logically the characters behave within their own you know worldview
right like what they were doing was logical to them and so that really helped
to draw me into the story and I enjoyed it a lot more because of that if they
were doing things that to themselves at least made absolutely no sense then it
would it would really really take away from the story especially because it's
basically here are characters plot occurs but man I feel so I feel maybe
genuine pity for people who think that logic is the enemy of yeah well you
don't understand what plot actually is if I could put it in a different way
think of plot as feeling with logic it's like I want something I want to do
something I want to achieve something and I'm gonna go and get that thing now
that thing you can call X I'm going to go from a to X that's a logical
association a impacts or a implies going to X that's it that's the plot that's
that's as simple as it can get a plot is what a plot is what ought to happen the
goal of the plot is what ought to happen yes but the the actual plot is
just basically desire what it's your emotion for something to do something
whatever its motivation and logic just says oh the character wanted to pick a
flower why isn't picking flowers why is he running around the house like there
has to be some correlation between just just a random example like somebody hits
you you get angry that's logical there's a logical progression of events there
just because it's emotional as a reaction doesn't mean now that logic has
to be flown out the window like no that makes sense yeah you have a you have a
plan or a goal or a thing yes all the people have emotional responses to
things and again they just they get completely like separated into you can
have one or the other you cannot have both although one takes away from the
other it's just nonsense you want to prove that a movie you hate is
objectively the worst thing ever but you don't want to sweat having to put
your own subjective opinion thereof up for scrutiny a big what is he talking
about this is just just separated it himself what does he think objective
means this is objectively the worst movie ever is like maybe he thinks
people are I've only heard people say that jokingly yeah well I will say this
this is objectively giving me a headache to the point that I think I'm
going to call it a night so I am just actually just not feeling very well
right now it's okay man I think it's actually abusing the movie Bob killed
you movie Bob actually broke me to the point where it's like oh my god I just
want to die listening to this video I could take Patrick Willems I can't take
movie Bob sorry man look after your it look after your brain and yeah catch you
again sometime have a fun fun night everyone I hope you're gonna have to
beat off pretty hard after this can I join you no oh I think this is something
this I think this is something that I need to undo on my own okay well in that
case maybe later I will see you guys we do this next week so mm-hmm I'll see you
guys next week all right man we kid 69 after the next downward thrust video we
do sounds like a good idea yeah sounds great you can make the audience go nuts
they're gonna be drawing things send you on Twitter you guys just already have
they already have all right I'll see you next week or whatever wolf yeah good
meeting you smud you too sir all right see you guys okay you can go now there we
go well fucking leave get out of here yeah I get what he's saying the feeling
he gets like this is like static it's like video essay status this might be
we've never had to pause this much like this is almost like perfectly taking the
name of the podcast because he's he crams nonsense into like finite pieces
because very my ends my take on what we just heard was him basically saying
people try to prove that something is objectively bad with like facts and
logic and stuff while trying to ignore the fact that their subjective opinion
is is obviously something that they don't want to have on screen because it
will be scrutinized as in like like if I said the last Jedi is the fucking
worst thing to ever happen to cinema and then I'm like oh I better not say that
what I'll say instead is that the last Jedi has all these plot holes and I'll
let label them and then I'll say you see objectively it is the worst thing to
happen to cinema and there I thought satisfied I thought he interpreted as
as you saying that is not objective but your subjective interpretation of why
it's bad god I hope he's not saying that I think that's what he's you know
let's give another listen to him the fact that this is like a video essay
whatever and people are drawing multiple conclusions based on what's in it like
it's the fucking Bible or some shit is really kind of weird like you should be
concise and clear not you know overly verbose and yeah I just I love the idea
we give a description of what we think it is and then someone else goes no it's
this and so would probably in chat would be like no it's this but it's like guys
this is not a good thing that's happening this shouldn't be this
difficult have more substantial criticism said more plainly if you want
to prove that a movie you hate is objectively the worst thing ever but you
don't want to sweat having to put your own subjective opinion thereof up for
scrutiny a big pile of plot holes real or perceived will do nicely even when
taking this very shortcut ends I'm stuck at the point of you said you wouldn't
want your subjective perspective like scrutinize but it's like you can't even
scrutinize a subjective perspective if it's entirely emotional based yeah like
if I said to you I despise this film it annoys me to no end and then someone
says like that's wrong what are they gonna do and maybe he's confusing the
subjective takeaway with the objective data that's the thing I don't know I
don't know what he's saying we shouldn't have to try and find out what you're
saying movie Bob like maybe that's why after 10 years I hate to keep referencing
Patrick Willems as being a superior essayist but I can understand what
Patrick Willems was saying it was bad but it made more sense Patrick is just a
child that movie Bob is a child trying not to be one but he's a child acting
like an adult it's as trying to it's as many of including us and I think chow
so it's just like he swallowed a thesaurus and he's just vomiting up
random words all in a row and just like oh god want to sweat having to put your
own subjective opinion thereof up for scrutiny a big pile of plot holes real
or perceived will do nicely even when taking this very shortcut ends up
exposed hang on he said real or perceived as in you can have actual
definitive plot holes meaning objective objective flaws surely that's why I would
say they are right yeah because they're real he's like he said real plot holes
and if you can have objective flaws you can have an objective assessment I'm not
saying what would be in this objective a sound but as long as he agrees it
exists then he said it does I mean maybe he maybe he didn't think that maybe he
thought more words was better than just fewer concise ones but he seems to one
of few clear things to me in this fucking video you know issues and films
it can be raised so just cool comment it says it's very easy listen to the
entire sentence that's how language works I'm not sure if that pisses
actually defending that movie Bob actually creates sentences because this
these feel like run on stream of consciousness yeah like you've plugged
in his brain it's just gonna move criticism said more plainly if you want
to prove that a movie you hate is objectively the worst thing ever but you
don't want to sweat having to put your own subjective opinion thereof up for
scrutiny a big pile of plot holes real or perceived will do nicely even when
taking this very shortcut ends up exposing the reason why successful
narratives generally prioritize theme and aesthetic above logic and structure
namely that human thinking is not a little bit no yeah I don't think that's
true at all opposite of the truth yeah yeah especially in science fiction or
space opera logic has to be the number one quality in terms of keeping the the
story consistent and believable so if you don't have rock-solid logic of the
lore of the character motivations of the science and tech or mysticism or fantasy
whatever it is your story falls apart so it's when it's solid you are then
allowed to have the drama hit very highs have the melodrama work well as opposed
to having unbelievable settings and unbelievable situations so yeah what he
just said was the exact opposite yeah think of think of a film like you're
watching a football game if there are no rules then the game will suck but if
there are rules that everyone you know abides by and follows then the game is
enjoyable and if people break the rules which is essentially what a plot hole
can be compared to where you have an established you know established
criteria and you part with that you break it then you know that affects how
the game is played now he could be talking about a tour theory or he the
cinema from the perspective of the okay I'm gonna make a film and I'm gonna make
a film piece this is more of the avant-garde style of cinema making which
you see a lot of French film shows or sorry film festivals so maybe he's going
for the effect the the context of things as opposed to the content actually
having problems which you know you're doing context over clarity I could see
that as possibly being an argument that could work in the context of cinema not
the context of storytelling the fact that you have to say all of that after
he says like one sentence we really have no idea what's going on in this very
shortcut ends up exposing the reason why successful narratives generally
prioritize theme and aesthetic above logic and structure namely that human
thinking isn't also success in what sense success in telling a story or success
in making money yeah is he saying that the most successful movies are just
illogical well obviously if you're focusing on drama it'll so I guess I
wouldn't yeah I wouldn't put it past them though if you use more ice in your
drink I mean like we just watched a video of a guy in that was his
criteria was basically it made money's therefore its quality hmm yeah shortcut
ends up exposed no I think the reason why successful narratives generally
prioritize theme and aesthetic above logic and structure namely that human
thinking is not logical by default in reality and thus no one living in a
human beings are logical we're not perfect obviously but we do operate
logically yeah I feel like there's this difference between irrational and
illogical as in we do a thing that to the outside world is like why would you
do that but then we have our own logic in the head that's functions yeah I'll
I'll use the witch as an example again we see for those of you don't know what's
story about a bunch of basically very you know much Puritans and they're super
super religious and they see the world through that lens in almost every aspect
to them that is logical to us it is not like everything they do is through the
context of you know the Bible and God and you know Satan and salvation that's
how they view the world and so as a result all of their actions a logically
are in step with that but to us as an outside observer would they are not
behaving logically to us but those characters think that they are take the
joke for example he actually explains his crazy logic in the Dark Knight he
has logic it's just that it's well you I guess you could call it broken it's the
same for Thanos he explains himself he has his logical progression of I do this
because of this this this and you can you can draw like emotional events or
experiences that the color this these decisions that that have given them this
sense of logics like bad information for example that planet that got saved
because Thanos culled half of the people on it he's like therefore culling half
of the universe will save the universe it's like that's not that's bad
information that just doesn't follow but you you think it does yeah but to him it
does and so he thinks he's acting logically so when we see him doing
things we're like okay he's following his internal logic like it this is the
thing is so much more interesting than he's making it sound there's so much
much we're talking about basic Aristotelian logic we're not talking about
kind of flavor of science that we've used logic in physics you know it's a
very mundane sort of interpretation of logic and what we go through mentally
our day-to-day so people are complicated they're not one or the other exactly
human society is operating in a logical world to begin with for example I'm old
enough to remember when the main place you'd see epic lists of plot holes was
the IMDB message boards may they burn in hell where for a very long time the
longest mistakes list was for Titanic and you know the reason why had very
little to do with it having more mistakes than other movies its size and
everything to do with it being a popular movie but a lot of people didn't like
the omnipresent puppy this is irrelevant yeah plus plus your ear assuming the
intentions of people on the internet back in whatever year you're talking
we don't even need to define whether or not he's accurate here because it has
no relevance to his point people talking about Titanic IMDB used to be a
haven for discrete listing plot holes okay okay to both of those they don't
mean anything do you like do you think that let's take it back old-school
Shakespeare man like his place makes sense as someone just sort of mentioned
in the chat is like what does he mean these so old that he went to IMDB to
look at like movie stuff like like facts about movies like I used to do that and
I'm not I'm 24 like I don't I'm not that old I mean I mean his I mean the
video title is but whole servers reference so I I don't know it's this
point doesn't make sense all that much really if if people want a good
assessment of Titanic by the way watch watch Plinkett deconstruct it he does a
really good job it's genuinely a fun video because it made me rethink how I
thought of Titanic and he does a very fair assessment of like the good parts
and the bad parts of Titanic and if if that was a result of having read the
lists on IMDB so be it yeah it doesn't change it doesn't change where you where
they said it and how angrily they say it does not change what they are saying
but yeah that's I'd whatever he can continue this is fine
the rarity of after a while and being able to rattle off a giant list of
structure issues was a good way to dunk on tight why does he say that yeah wow
with the quotes structure issues it's like you are there no are there none well
he already admitted that there are both real and not real issues so are these
the fake ones movie Bob or these the real ones that you're talking about I'd
whatever we'll let him continue a popular movie but a lot of people didn't
like the omnipresent popularity of after a while and being able to rattle off a
giant list of structure issues was a good way to dunk on Titanic fans while
sounding like you were simply a more sharp-eyed discerning connoisseur of
film so there you go that's that's what this all comes down to he's assuming
that the intention of people like us is to like to to purport that our feelings
with the correct results because of the facts at hand and and this is coming
from movie Bob who gave a shout out to the guy who said unironically you're
watching movies the wrong way I mean the irony is palpable of course but
I was gonna say something about this prior related Titanic then I think I got
lost in thought and again just just to account for this someone in chat said
you've completely lost track of what he's saying and pausing to analyze half
sentences isn't helping that's not what we're doing no we are not losing track
we are attempting to find out what he is saying we're grabbing full sentences so
yeah man it's because it's because it takes him a frame to make a full sentence
he's spitting out words man like a machine gun yeah so and they were rather
than uh I'm so tired of hearing about the boat movie god it was such a well
also it makes sense that they would criticize really popular films because
if you talk about films that people haven't seen then I mean they're just
gonna have to take your word for everything I find that um if you want to
approach a topic about writing in general then you know the the the movie
that you take say for example you do in movies then just just take one that the
mainstream understand or at least seen then they'll be able to join the
conversation I suppose that's a less nefarious way of looking at it cuz it
has to be nefarious right I guess I mean like he started off by assuming the
intentions of people on IMDB back in 1997 so and yeah and by the way like I'm
sure many people in check and understand this like it's pretty hard to do this
video in general like cuz he says so much stuff so quickly like he's like got
three points in one sentence so it's like we rewind we keep rewinding surely
that's evidence that we're trying to find out exactly what he's trying to say
I think I think anyway who's was a good way to dunk on Titanic fans while
sounding like you were simply a more sharp-eyed discerning connoisseur of
film and they were rather than uh I'm so tired of hearing about the boat movie
god it was such a checklist right oh it looked to you like there was probably
room on the door for both of them like maybe there was space and it was a big
enough door and it would have supported both their bodies out of the water and
Jack wouldn't have had to freeze and they could have I can't remember if I
actually thought that when I first saw the movie because I was I was young
obviously I can't remember if I saw that but I'm pretty sure Mythbusters did do
this and they proved that it's possible but it'd be really difficult that you'd
have to get the life preservers underneath the door and that's not
something that's simple to pull off freezing yeah I mean it in plus when
you're going you know when you're in this scenario you know you know you're
probably not at your most lucid but this is my this is my how it comes down to an
issue right let's just say for example I adore Titanic and then rags brought this
to me he's like by the way jacket I just got on the door dude that kind of takes
away from the entire final event and then and then I'd be like hmm but you've
gotten on the door and then it's like how could we find that out and it's like
well look at the scene see the space see how much it's floating I guess kind
of inconclusive and then you get people like Mythbusters to have like some kind
of definitive proof that we could discuss it doesn't have to be that I
automatically assume that rags is trying to undo my perspective that rags like
dunk on him but even then isn't that a form of appreciating the movie and it's
like what's wrong with that yes for me it's a discussion to me it didn't need
to become this idea of us versus them like yeah did Mythbusters did you assume
that Mythbusters hate this movie because they tested it exactly also I need to
pee because I drink a lot of water and eat a lot of well while he's going for
people what's your take on movie Bob smud boy just overly like bombastic and
pedantic and he's he's his ideas are they're not connected like he's saying
things that that are not equally transferable to what he's trying to
explain so it's like okay you have subjective opinions and you cannot
observe the objective or you can express objective it's like yes you can we do it
all the time we do it in science we do it with the scientific method we do it
with math we do it sitting down for lunch I mean it's this is a common
practice so it seems as if he's putting a a high level of of importance to
people interpreting things as opposed to people understanding what they're
seeing and observing like this this is what we do we look at a game go this is
what's going on this is not my opinion this is actually what's happened yeah
and that's it that's all we're doing we're not doing anything special I
genuinely think it makes for an interesting conversation and if you don't
want to be a part of that conversation that's absolutely fine pretty much like
if you go I don't talk about that I want to talk about how it made me feel it's
like okay sure that's not what we're talking about like so you know that's
cool and everything and it's not that we wouldn't talk about it it's just that
don't do it at the exact same time like you you highlight to me that Luke is
inconsistent and then I say well I enjoyed it you'd be like okay that's
fine good there's nothing to do with what I said because they automatically
assume you're presenting your feelings I felt I'm using consistent rather than
consistent what I observed over the years is what people or what I've seen in
media which is actually good is not how how you know the highs of drama or the
highs of science fiction or whatever it's that that piece of fiction didn't
have any lows didn't have any errors didn't have any flaws so things like the
Princess Bride is just a fun adventure movie that happens to be about romance
and happens to be about a frame where a grandfather loses a pause sorry a sneeze
go ahead go ahead go ahead no I was just talking about how great Princess Bride
movie is well oh yeah because it's so simple there's there's very there are
actually plot holes in there but the actual storytelling doesn't make you
wear them very well they're there if you think about them but it's magical enough
it draws you in enough that you're following everything and everything's so
clear that you don't stop and thing go hey wait a second doesn't Wesley have a
whole pirate army on his boat can't they just rush the castle and all these
little questions might pop up you don't think about it and after the fact you do
think about it yeah yeah that is kind of silly but it still doesn't degrade the
story it just makes you think in a different way yeah you could take
something like that and you could just go all the way with it and you can say
this is the Princess Bride there are plot holes everywhere and you can prove
that they're plot holes and okay sure it's okay to still love the movie
exactly we shouldn't need to say that but we apparently have to all the time
yeah lived happily ever after and that's such an obvious plot contrivance and it
totally broke your immersion Wow you're so right it's just such bad writing that
220-somethings you just spent hours running he really is focused on this
door thing yeah this seems like he's pissed about this do you think this is
the reason why he puts it in so that people will be oh yeah I agree with that
and so that all the other stupid shit that went on in the in the in the video
he's making they just because he gets lost over I mean like I agree with him
on this bit so the rest of it's probably right if I sprinkle this this video of
fucking garbledygook with this door thing that everyone knows about or of
people have heard about or with this and that then maybe I can trick people into
thinking this is good content I mean like I said so before the analysis I
knew about the Mythbusters thing so as far as I'm concerned it's not even an
issue because it would have been really hard for Jack to have done what was
suggested and it would have risked Rose which is another reason why he could
have decided yeah fuck it I'm not gonna do that because once you get wet you're
fucked yeah there's a lot it's just it makes sense I think that scene but
let's see what he seems to have counters to this you're so right it's
just such bad writing that 220-somethings you just spent hours running
climbing handcuff escaping getting shot at nearly drowning multiple times all
while escaping a sinking ship and are now gradually freezing to death in the
middle of the ocean conscious of the fact that they may be exchanging their
last words to each other on earth don't act with 100% clear-headed logic but
that's the honor if they're on the ocean okay see what I mean this is this is why
this is evidence that we do listen to them by the way he made a lot of logical
arguments for why they would be unable to have committed to the action right
he said like they would have been exhausted they would have been way over
their heads they've been through extreme drama there's like all these things you
can actually consider these are things that actually happened and then he's
like so why didn't they make a logical decision because they're emotional right
now it's like you don't need to you don't need to say that that wasn't
actually something that's like a different argument now you were talking
about actual tangible things that we can actually discuss like if Jack was
exhausted he's not going to be able to pull off the task the mythbusters said
would have been required that's an actual argument which he would be
exhausted because of the amount of swimming and running and everything that
he's just described like this is and he's doing right now what I assumed was
his issue in the first place with people you know like we present an argument
this like pedantic with all the information presented and then he
actually counters provides a bunch of even more pedantic information to
actually make the scenario make sense and then he's like also you shouldn't do
this anyway and it's just like oh well Patrick Willems did the same thing he
said like these things don't matter and then he actually has responses like to
counter them it's like if they don't matter why even bothering with the
with the counters
he denies logic and starts using it it's it's exactly hypercritical very strange
and start puzzling out the weight mass area buoyancy ratio of their present
situation that would have been so much more narratively and emotionally
satisfying than it doesn't well fuck it we could fix it would just make the door
smaller yeah if maybe people do find that satisfying okay he went through all
this trouble to try and explain it away when I could just be like I think the
scene may have run a bit better if you made the door small enough that it
looked like it could fit one and a half roses and so you'd be like oh yeah if he
gets on there too is probably not gonna last like there you go if you make the
door big enough that everyone's asking why couldn't jacket on it too who knows
maybe that could be an element of maybe we should change that up but again as
far as I know this was proven to be that Jack probably wouldn't be able to do it
so yeah and you know what I mean the conversations over I didn't even tell
you what I felt about the scene there I didn't say whether it was bad or good
even I just said you could make that change so why not make that change and
that would be something to consider next time you make this film or someone has a
similar scene there you go nobody had to be hurt you know we didn't have to take
anything away from anybody when we said that matter that they both could ever
not because Jack willingly allows himself to die in order to make
absolutely sure that Rose does not a final act of such complete selfless
devotion that cements our understanding of why this was the defining emotional
connection of her entire life as symbolized by the fact that she has
never revealed the heart of the ocean the only keepsake of that part of her
life to anyone until symbolically returning it and herself to the sea see
he thinks that's subjective that's all objective as far as I know these are
all things actually happen in the film yeah all of those things you could trace
and track and they're established and so like this is so weird but like I agree
with you Bob so I fly Bob why don't why don't you agree with yourself which is
what you call a series of themes if you have even a rudimentary graphic themes
yeah what is he talking about let's just give that a full listen again this was
the defining emotional connection of her entire life as symbolized by the fact
that she has never revealed the heart of the ocean the only keepsake of that part
of her life to anyone until symbolically returning it and herself to the sea
which is what you call a series of themes if you have even a rudimentary
grasp of how humans work as emotional beings symbolically returning it and
herself her she actually returned it and herself to the ocean but she she
didn't she just threw it back in she didn't go back in oh yeah she doesn't
go back into she she yeah she stays on the boat and she dies
I'm very confused because he's mixed a lot of things that actually happen and
he's decided to can like and what's the theme what does the theme have to do
with all of this yeah what I love to hear just what is the theme in in a in a
in a sentence or just described in a it's an anti-capitalist message the theme
of never forget who truly loved you if that's a theme of kill forget the past
killing if you have to I but I think what's really interesting here too is
that right after this he says him which is really like you're doing a good thing
kind of you're like analyzing stuff that's in the film you're pointing out
things that actually happen you made up the one about returning herself to the
ocean the fucking made that up pull that out of your ass but the rest of it was
really good and you're trying to pass it off as like you're doing a good thing
but then you told us earlier it's not a good thing is it where what is your
stance Bob is it the theme of what makes true love is that it I don't know
that's the thing I'm confused because that's the thing about themes fucking
anything you want them to be basically that was a very that's just a confusing
section this is the thing if he was here we could actually have like an actual
discussion right that would take so long to get through to understand that he
would have had to have made like an hour video to get his point across with
clarity but then he would have had to justify it but then he would be looked
at the same way that I am where it's like ah you fucking have you couldn't
explain a simple idea in under an hour that's pathetic video very strange so you
had to do this in nine minutes and it's only now that I'm starting to like be
able to chew on something but it's only because he actually had references for
movies because he did the thing that he started off saying was not good yeah
he's doing it he's doing the reverse right so we pick all these things apart
and titanic let's say then he picks it apart back at us he's like look at all
these things these are good things these are things that tell us things and it's
like oh oh great and then he's like this is theme you're like what didn't follow
that seems if you have even a rudimentary grasp of how humans work as
emotional beings ahem yeah he's saying I guess he's telling us that we don't have
a rudimentary with how people work as human beings yeah because the person the
person who's an unironic apologist for eugenics is telling us about the
rudimentary understanding of how people's emotions work it's so job they're
really ruining the word theme I find they use it for everything then like see
all yeah it cuz it can be so much and so little and everything and nothing and
like putting it saying it's better than everything else in terms of elements and
then you're like but you haven't even told me what it is to you it's just this
mystical thing that happens ahem see also no it is not in fact a big problem
that Indiana Jones could have just sat out the events of Raiders of the Lost
Ark because the Lost Ark was just gonna blow up the Nazis when they tried to
open it anyway yeah but he didn't know that
yeah I don't see that film in so long that I'm not gonna be able to counter
whatever point he's making here to be honest yes yeah I think he's making the
point that it kills the Nazis at the end so he didn't it turns out he didn't have
to bother but he didn't know that so he acted in a logical way with the
information he had yeah so I don't know what Bob's point is other than Bob's
wrong again I just I don't understand this man the plot mechanics of how that
group of a dozen or so Nazis and Bella got blown up it's about dr. Jones
undergoing a fundamental evolution in the way he views the supernatural and
values the intangible esoteric value of the treasures he runs around grave
robbing and was blithely dismissive of at the beginning of the story so does
he consider is all of this object mechanics what is he talking about is
all of this objective or subjective because what he sounds like he's saying
it's things that could be proven with references like you know he says dr.
Jones didn't take whatever seriously you play a little clip of him saying like
that's a bunch of mumbo-jumbo and then at the end of the film that's not mumbo
jumbo at all like there you go what what are the plot mechanics of him whatever
he was developing as I think he was talking about learning about whatever he
said what is that how does that translate how does that even work what
plot mechanics do we have to go through to learn that or did he have to learn
also he's what if you catch it he's making that same argument that Willems
did where in his mind the the ark thing doesn't make sense right let's just go
with that for a second that let's say he always knew that the ark was gonna do
that so go in for it made no sense he's saying that doesn't matter because
the film is about him moving forward as a character now if you remember Patrick
Willems said that the fact that Holdo acts like a complete fucking idiot
doesn't matter because it's about giving a chance for Finn and Poe to grow so it
comes back to the idea it's like so you can have a plot that makes sense or you
can choose one that doesn't why did you choose the one that didn't make sense
because that's what happens when your first draft is the final draft or
because it made sense to them at first and then they were like oh fuck well I've
made the movie doubt no because that's the thing you could save it all with
themes the magical panacea to all your narrative woes apply directly to the
forehead story in the more immediate past beginning of the story in the more
immediate past see yes the most recent main series Star Wars move oh what did he
what did he write there let's I'm not sure how you introduced the last Jedi
let's have a look you of the treasures he runs around grave robbing and was
blithely dismissive of at the beginning of the story I like it of course movie
Bob it's not archaeology is grave robbing like okay I gotcha sure in the
more immediate past see yes the most recent main series Star Wars movie
activate shields deflector shield okay cuz cuz we're all gonna hate him for
defending the lost Jedi get it yeah some of you are gonna love me and some of you
are gonna hate me which has been decried by a grand swath of the internet
as being awash in contrivance poor storytelling and plot holes galore by
virtue of it depicting its main cast of emotionally compromised 20 year olds
thrust haphazardly into unprepared leadership positions during a mass so
he's making the argument that things don't make sense because it's being led
by a bunch of young people who are emotionally you know Lord like holdo
holdo is very young very inexperienced this general doesn't know anything about
a man I wish all these women had flaws that they could go and develop with but I
didn't actually see any so yeah I don't know what he's referring to exactly rose
a young person I guess she wasn't flawed at all I just let's hear it all to make
sure I'm pretty sure he's saying that it's stupid for us to complain that
things aren't logical because these are emotional and young characters making
mistakes I think that's what he's getting at main series Star Wars movie
which has been decried by a grand swath of the internet as being awash in
contrivance poor storytelling and plot holes galore by virtue of it depicting
its main cast of emotionally compromised 20 year olds thrust haphazardly into
unprepared leadership positions during a massive war is making a lot of mistakes
trusting the wrong people and or instant generally not up there you go so that's
yeah he thinks that explains the issues in the last Jedi yeah yeah the plot
holes in the last Jedi are because young people and what he claims is a
giant war is they can't make good decisions which doesn't explain which
doesn't explain Holdo which doesn't explain Hux which doesn't explain snow
which doesn't explain Leia and it's like it doesn't explain Luke as I don't I'm
like man Wow what I what I'm hearing here taken to the extreme is you you
watch a film where there's an emotionally breaking down character who's
just really upset and angry and they walk through a door and it just opens up
into like a fucking a giant pit and they fall right into it and then land on a
dragon it takes them back up then someone says you know like a teacher of
the school that they were in don't go down to the dragon pit ever again okay
and they're like yeah okay we point out that that made no sense whatsoever
because it's like based in earth whatever and then they go yeah but she's
emotionally you know she's young and she's emotional so this illogical thing
that takes place is explained because she's emotional like you've completely
blended two types of like discussions again they keep doing this like something
making not no sense in the plot is not explained by someone being emotional it
just make every every character in all media young and there are no plot holes
anymore yeah that's the thing any problem you could ever come up with it
could be like oh well the characters were young and emotional yeah they were
they were young and emotional or they were old and senile so why would they
using y-wings they were young and emotional it's like yeah what why didn't
huck shit why did hucks target the base first because young and emotional was
young and emotional why was Yoda able to use lightning as a force ghost we've
never seen that before because Yoda young and emotional fuck Bob did you
watch this fucking movie did you watch this video back it's another question
parading on a 100% logical basis at all times I mean sure it could be that
there's a rattle unsubtle thematic intent to that made obvious by the
recurring plot presence of multiple this subtle later how is he talking about
thematic plot presence like what what are these terms he said it was he said
it was a subtle thing made obvious like let's do it again I swear this at all
times I mean sure it could be that there's a rattle unsubtle thematic
intent oh sorry he said unsubtle that's my bad
unsubtle I could have sworn he said subtle out of it for you
unsubtle thematic intent what the freaking unsettled thematic intent it
that that can't be found no matter how hard it's so unsubtle it can't be found
logical basis at all times I mean sure it could be that there's a rattle
unsubtle thematic intent to that and made obvious by the recurring plot
presence of multiple dysfunctional mentor pupil relationships and an
overarching theme of generational transition but what what is plot
presence does anyone know plot presence it means that it is present within the
film because the entire film is the plot I suppose it's just another one of
those shitty surface level literally he said something extremely
simple but he made it sound complicated with words that were unnecessary
and then he was just flat out wrong on top of it all I've used the word plot a
lot of a lot of mine analyses but I've never used
plot presence like it's another way of saying it was there
I'm not even kidding dude like whatever it's the claim that it's the claim that
they were there multiple dysfunctional mentor pupil
relationships and an overarching theme of generational transition but nah it
must just be bad writing or writing in service of an agenda and that well so an
overarching theme uh as opposed to the normal theme which is explains everything
so there's no the bigger theme which explains everything else I assume
and the the whole like what nonsense to say it's in favor of an agenda and it's
like what if the directors and the writers tell you that they had an agenda
does that mean there is still no agenda like it's it's like the Macintosh video
where he starts off by saying it's a conspiracy and then spends the rest of
the video explaining exactly why that conspiracy is the point of the video
Macintosh's conclusion is the Last Jedi is a film about men learning that they
need to listen to women to improve themselves or something like that and
it's important for gender equality it's like yeah that's the last line
that sounds like a fucking agenda I don't know maybe I have the definition wrong
does movie bob dare to disagree with Jonathan Macintosh yeah I feel like those two would be
they wouldn't want to step on each other's toes you know
I wouldn't mind if you bob to step on my toes too I'm fucking probably crushing
an agenda and that's the final most insidious aspect of plot hole obsessed
film culture's devaluation of thematic analysis okay whoa whoa whoa the veneer of quasi-imperialism
the devaluation analysis what let's try it let's try it one more time getting in service of an
agenda and that's the final most insidious aspect of plot hole obsessed film culture's
devaluation of thematic analysis the veneer of quasi-impiracism can be a very effective dude
de-evaluation of thematic analysis the veneer of quasi-impiracism dude I I see your I see your
googly gawked and crazy what the hell why did you have to say all over that way
didn't look what so I'm kind of in disbelief that that's he wrote that and he thought yeah
that's that's a really great way to get my point across so at the top of my browser my first my
first bookmark is to a thesaurus and the reason that I use it is because if I I don't want to use
the same word over and over it's not so that I can go out of my way to try and sound intelligent
you know it's just so that oh I've used this word a lot I want to just for the sake of people
listening let's use you know a different word for it I want to use the exact quote in my next April
Fool's video so I'm gonna have to listen to this just to just to make sure I get it
and that's the final most insidious aspect of plot hole obsessed film culture's devaluation
of thematican dude you know what no I'll I'll write it later it's gonna take me way too long
to write this out because I'd fucking I'd have to keep replaying it because he speaks so fucking
fast so I'll just write a note of where it is movie bob plot hole what does this surface
what does plot hole surfers mean do you think it's butthole surfer's reference the band
oh okay yeah there's a band called all band called butthole surfers and he's
he's referencing them because I like to be his ass it's like he says that it's ridiculous for
us to assume an agenda and he's constantly talking about like the agenda behind people doing
the plot hole analysis you find that interesting yeah and that's the final most insidious aspect
of plot hole obsessed film color that's the thing it's only a conspiracy when the bad guys do it
yeah devaluation of thematic analysis the veneer of quasi empiricism can be a very effective tool
for nefariously slipping one's own subjective viewpoint or value one's to know like other
it's funny because it's nefarious it's nefarious to take your own subjective viewpoint
it's a nefarious thing dude there's so much wrong with this
he just argued that like people use plot holes to try get their own nefarious subjective
perspectives across the board i feel like he's heading towards nazism he's getting there he's
gonna be like here's the thing people people are trying to use evidence to support their claim
people are trying to use what's in the movie to show here's why i feel the things that i feel
but but that's like that that's bad it's you know he he says it's nefarious
like this is typical movie bob is like if you have an opinion that differs from mine it's
nefarious heavy but have you ever have you ever like read this guy's fucking crazy ass tweets and
shit uh only in memes that's about yeah yeah yeah like this movie bob's insane he's insane
that's the best way to put it yeah he's he's nuts like i have nothing to say i can't exactly
exactly like if we let this play again for just the the 15 seconds or whatever just take in these
words it's absolute insanity and that's the final most insidious aspect of plot hole obsessed film
culture's devaluation of thematic analysis the veneer of quasi empiricism can be a very effective
tool for nefariously slipping one's own subjective value one that you know might otherwise be
challenged or get you called out as reactionary or worse into the discourse nestling it covertly
among the nitpicks until it sounds like just one more true but meaninglessly so factoid see
he thinks people are trying to throw they're like almost their politics into the discussion
or something like because he said he said yeah quasi-imperialism i thought he said quasi-imperialism
because he was talking about the movie i was like wait no no he's talking about but that's the thing
with movie bob you could believe that he brings up quasi-imperialism but yeah he's he's saying
they argue the facts while trying to slip their own subjective feelings underneath
instead of being outward about it that's not what i do that's exactly what we do exactly and that's
the that's the part he doesn't seem to get it would be like me going um the last jedi is all
about how the government is trying to make frogs gay that's how i open and then i you just be like
okay that's ridiculous or or i go so i'm gonna do a scene by scene breakdown hey this is this is
interesting in the scene where he's milking the um the gay frog uh he's and then i go interesting
how that's gay frogs in this film huh wonder what that's about who knows and then i and i
keep alluding to it until at the end i go weird i guess we have to conclude that this film is
trying to convince us that the government is making frogs gay i think that's what he's saying
that we do like trying to get our weird insane idea across through as many facts as we can find
that would match it i maybe maybe you you think that i i wish one of us can make sense of this
gay frogs as nefarious as just saying the last jedi is not very well written
it doesn't have to be so nefarious that you know i just i don't don't really see where
he's coming from i'd love to get an example wouldn't that be cool just an example of someone
doing what he's saying those are nuts nefarious if he's like shows a guy's video where he says
that uh the last jedi proves that socialism will destroy planet earth well we already have enough
proof without the movie but the idea to put well this this is the irony man movie bob always pushes
his politics through media yeah that's why everyone that's why when you know the escapist
came out and said we're going to try to be a political and then they said we're hiring
movie bob everyone was like um you sure you sure you're you're sure you're a political
also are you sure we're nearly there guys like a minute and a half hopefully he has an
outro that's like not related i hope he's getting oh oh gosh look at this you guys are
born of a cod look look what he typed into the search dumbest shit on youtube
and uh so you can see dishonored wolf sargon of a cad um i'm not sure whose video that is that's
obviously mine that's dave kellen that's pewdiepie so obviously all of us are the dumbest
shit on youtube and it's like yeah take a pass at someone who's far more popular and more
influential than you will ever hope to be in your life bob i know that makes you upset yeah let's
check out how he's going to represent us uh very fairly the nitpicks until it sounds like just one
more true but meaninglessly so factoid why don't they just use light speed kamikaze all the time
if it's so effective can all the jedi astral project seems useful you're telling me that two
women in leadership roles here and they aren't constantly fighting and undercutting one another
as all women off actually want to do it good lord did you guys get that he started off pretty solid
yeah he started with very fair questions and then it went into more women maybe maybe that's his
point that's what he's saying our videos do where we we say fact fact and then we slip in a crazy
idea with the facts but again bob this should be easy to prove man just get a clip get a clip
you don't need to literally create a straw man for sargon called zarbon
i like it because of how subtle it is yeah i couldn't you couldn't tell could you
and look at the look at the description it's a trap to overthrow and undermine western civilization
it's like yeah i mean if sargon wrote that i'd imagine it was parody but you know
i'm sure he thinks that that's what we all think about this yeah
it would work why would luke leave a map if he had no intention of wanting to be found
uh wait i'm sorry what was that there no i i'm i'm legitimately curious if he was going to answer
some of those he's inventing a straw man just for us thank you very much but that's the thing he has
to invent a straw man but he's like but i'll hide it with uh i'll hide it in the middle of a bunch
of things that actually make sense it's been us to that last point talk about them i don't believe
there is any reference that luke was the one who left the map we assume he did because it's in r2 d2
but from the writers at least this is what i found they they are saying the r2 d2 has the the big
part of the map because when he was fiddling around with the death star or whenever else in
the empire he downloaded the big portion of the map that the empire also have which is what
kylo alludes to the film never actually says that luke left the map behind oh that's a reasonable
inference to make well this is the thing i understand why people thought that because the
film does not give you hardly any information about the fucking map so you're left to assume
and then it's like luke wanted to die why the hell did he leave a map behind and then you're like
well technically he didn't because because everybody it's it's so out there it's very strange
like i said uh the reasoning from the writers are is that um art you had the map and the smaller
portion of the map was given to uh what's his name the old dude at the beginning
and i'm not uh we're supposed to assume that he was looking for the jedi temple which is where
everyone assumed that luke was going because apparently luke went searching for it and let
people know that that's what he was doing but it's interesting i'm glad this was in the film
yeah i know and and and then you're like but wait why was he searching for the jedi temple
if he just wanted to die did you just he just really wanted to die there was he sentimental
like about because the theme is about the either way right we just got a conversation out of that
and yeah you know if you two didn't know about what i just said then now you do and it's like
there you go i can assist you in an argument next time you talk about it or enlighten you in any way
or maybe it didn't matter to you at all we didn't i didn't have to fucking like tell you your
feelings don't matter i'm gonna i've gotta use them i gotta use it i gotta take a piss again
i'll be right back it's all right i'll read some super chats um this is where the fun begins watch
mole versus obi one at the end uh the one from rebels it's five minutes and it's an amazing scene
otherwise dull series i've actually seen that clip before i'd watched any of the shows just
because i was interested in um the idea someone was like they did this and i was like oh wait
really and i checked it out uh the real insult here is he's low-key comparing you guys to cinema
sins a lot of people do um in fact there's a lot of comments online i've seen that say that i'm much
worse than cinema sins because cinema sins is like more obviously a joke while i try to convince
people that i'm serious even though i'm joking or something like that so you know take that for
what you will question for wolf i'm afraid he's gone but uh just um i don't know cinema pm with
that one um it was kill fuck mary toby why so jared and er i don't know what he would say to
that honestly ryan johnson quote there has to be a plot before you can have plot holes i agree
this movie bob i can't understand it freaking word this i need oh this movie bob i can't
understand it freaking word i i think i fall away saying there why is movie bob such a faggot you
can't say that's rude do you think movie bob realizes that if he ever again brings up a plot
hole in a film people can just use this video against him and call him a reductionist yeah
this is the problem for them this is i can't remember if we said this live into a corner
i can't remember if we said this yeah i can't remember if we said this live or not but we were
saying like imagine being that little bird on their shoulder whenever they watch or enjoy anything and
then they say well that didn't make sense and then you just go what do you mean what do you
mean it didn't make sense it doesn't matter now you have to explain yourself so you're fucked
thesis the last jedi is a bad film there you go a mauler big daddy rags and wolf hello back
john reese that was john reese said that rags say hello back
piece of shit you guys say hi to future me while watching this tomorrow
hello future unspan unspun one there you go
email or do a lot of 3d design work would you like a 3d printed drink coaster with your channel
logo on it by any chance oh i'm i'm gonna get some new art eventually so um if ever you wanted to
do that i would say hold off for now uh you'll murder the very concept of culture not just culture
itself uh what did you actually say the concept of culture or just no idea it's trouble enough to
follow anyway the greatest movie is just good themes which is why the greatest movie ever made
is a video of daisy ridley reciting positive tweets for three hours well that's the thing
man if all that matters is themes then surely the best movie would just be shoving as many as
you could into one movie like just get get all the best google the best themes and then have a
character read them out as you pretty much implied the best movie ever uh problem is twofold he's
arguing that it's becoming common for people to use the term plot hole as a shorthand for
everything they didn't understand like no matter if it actually is one i agree with that that would
be a problem if it's happening obviously yeah pizza rolls or italian gushers uh then further
that people have begun settling for just listing these erroneous plot holes as conclusive proof
that their opinion is fact rather than providing research and legitimate evidence again if they're
doing that that is bad but like if someone said i was doing that in in the last july critique i
would be frustrated so i'd be like man i spent a long time getting those references i'd appreciate
if they were debunked rather than just waved off as opinion you know there's a difference between
those those two types of people but if bob is i mean bob is clearly coming after for some reason me
wolf sargon dave cullen pewdiepie and whoever else like we're all in the same group apparently
remember i'm the angry guy who made the five hour videos according to uh patrick willams hey guys
here you mentioned it yesterday but detroit become human isn't actually that bad i actually
has goodwill building and death as real branching consequences for the three main characters
i've not played it i don't know frags has osmuth which which game detroit become human no no i i
play games oh oh again i don't think about it so no david cage plays you that's how it works
he moves uh what is he's what he's saying since y'all don't know the source matter and it's not
explainable detail y'all deem it as a plot hole uh if you require extra sources to be able to
understand the plot in a film you may be in trouble yes um everybody pancakes or waffles
um waffles i'm gonna go with waffles none against pancakes but i'm gonna go with i'm
gonna go with waffles i was gonna say i'm cool with both of them i'll just i'll be safe
and go with waffles these two shows it must be for a good reason you ever had chicken and pancakes
i think so
i haven't had chicken and waffles though when are you and wolf gonna digivolve as critics uh
obviously that's next to all the on the agenda uh what's each of your favorite prequels and why
do you think it's so much easier to like the prequels despite how awful they are i think it's
because you can see a good story behind the bad execution well for me it's uh revenge of the sith
i just think that there's a lot more going on and it it stands the test of scrutiny better than the
other two uh and i generally enjoy the film more but um as for as for why it's easier to like them
i imagine a lot of people would disagree with that statement for me it's that uh yeah i actually
think i would i agree with the reasoning that um i think i can see a good idea behind bad execution
that's probably how i put it what about you guys i mean i can see that i can yeah i can
they got progressively better um it was very low bar but they did get better wait for what now
prequels the prequels uh i guess they got better yeah well but like you said that's a pretty low
uh which is the favorite for you two i'm assuming smuds is revenge of the sith if
he said they progressively got better yeah probably revenge of the sith yeah fair enough um
uh 10 fps our memories of minecraft on a notebook i would respond to the feeling straw man we
recognize the value of feelings but they are subordinate to logical thought from our perspective
we are concerned about them taking the lead in discussion correct yeah which i because that's
something that feel something therefore this government policy should be enacted i feel
something therefore it is morally righteous for me to punch you on the street and when it comes to
art analysis or whatever some people like why do you why are you saying the objective
assessments are better than subjective ones and it's like it's not about being better it's
literally just drawing the line so that we can actually have a concise and clear conversation
that's all you don't have to say anything if anything it's unifying yeah we can both agree
on something that it's much easier to agree on something that's objective and that kind of
brings us together into a conversation yeah and plus if you want to use just objective observations
you don't have to do the art form you can do the genre you can do the medium you can do
a certain aspect and you can still use the same technique so it's more useful i think uh bob
marked infinity war is released in 2017 how yeah he keeps keeps going for the whole video so i
guess he just he must have missed that one uh my question is is bob's position on tyler perry
feels or logic based it's one of the things i remember bob saying from before i stopped
watching him i don't i'm assuming you're saying he likes tyler perry and the oh he doesn't i don't
know um i wouldn't expect consistency from movie bob yeah no i i certainly wouldn't either there's
none in this video so i doubt there's gonna be as a is total wick uh i haven't seen word salad
this impenetrable since my attempt to read eagle hegel hegel you're an old soul mauler wise but
but beyond your years yes i am a an ancient wise 24 year old wizard uh the bombers in the last
jedi were designed by an sjw thus the white male design y wing wasn't used i see there's the agenda
guys slip it in that's because the y wing is the y chromosome damn so given the tons of talk about
plot and story i'm currently jotting down a script aimed at explaining the difference between the two
in action i think i'll loosely reference fail bob during it more power to you because i don't think
he's helping make the conversation clearer in this video at all uh we need to bring movie bob on
for a live debate more of us has moved on of quasi empiricism i seriously doubt he would ever
consider me worth his time uh a use your feelings b i felt angry a at a kid's movie with women in
power garbage human oh right so the person a says use your feelings person b says okay i felt angry
and the person a says at a kid's movie with women in power you're a garbage human like yeah that is
actually a another contradiction they're saying like you should value your emotional reaction and
then when you provide it to them they get frustrated with you well that's why he called them nefarious
earlier on is like if you're a subjective and you know the subjective stuff is far more important
but if it's not the right subjective opinion then fuck you black panther is putting chemicals in the
water to make the rhino milk gay the rhino milk turns you gay except it ain't milk do you think
ryan johnson's thinks he's good at sex because he submits a woman's expectations by not giving
her an orgasm that would you know you could use that as an analogy for the last jedi in some ways
like i i think the one i used on one of the podcasts we had was like a birthday with no gifts
like everyone comes in they're like here's all the boxes unwrapped and you're like woohoo and there's
nothing in any of them and they're like you didn't expect that nothing like thanks molar is here by
named irony man very well but yes thank you all very much for the donations we've only got a minute
and a half left i'm so and most of it's probably just going to be him doing bad impressions of
sargon apparently so i hope so another as all women are factually want to do at work why would
luke leave a map if he had no intention of wanting to be found uh wait i'm sorry what was that third
one again how has no one just bumped into a conda after all these centuries if they have all that
vibranium why not make black panther uniforms for everyone in the kingdom to be on the safe side
why is killmonger mad about racism in america like that's still a real thing in 2018 what's he
going to do next take a knee how did charlotte fall off the mountain into a river only to be
formed by fishermen from a different mountain at a higher elevation these are actually like some of
these are quotes from my video yeah really yeah so because i was about to say i was about to say
some of these like are they make sense as questions other than the obvious drama and i don't think i
said why is he acting like racism is a real thing in america i don't think i ever said that yeah i
don't i don't know i definitely said it's weird that he fell off a waterfall and ended up at the
bottom of a mountain at a higher elevation it was the most retarded fucking sequence of events ever
but apparently that's irrelevant compared to the emotional journey that's probably what he's gonna
argue i guess uh what was that about real in 2018 again ah see okay so he's saying that i
reference valid plot holes but then i throw in that racism isn't a thing
to try and get my political perspective across but i never say that in my black panther video
yeah i i don't know anyone who's who's said that racism doesn't exist i mean other than
the sense that now maybe like structurally i'm not mad but this is like quinton levels
of misrepresenting my work but he's careful enough to not mention me by name this is the
the most bizarre version of poisoning the well with uh with a straw man i've ever seen i mean
yeah this is this is one of the most classic examples of a straw man you could possibly find
he literally like took me and then put stuff in me that's not actually me and then beat it down as
being like a piece of shit this is like yeah that's you didn't you didn't count to me mate
you counted some other thing called mule or something it's just let me cherry pick the
things that i it's not it's like cherry picking plus because you're cherry picking a thing that
you invented and this is the thing if this was happening if people were like man it doesn't make
sense that jack sits on the door also heterosexual relationships are just stupid no one should be
anything but gay but uh yeah the other plot point that's an issue in titanic you should be like what
the fuck was that what did you just say about hetero say but like show us that why can't you
show us someone doing that heterodormative i don't understand why it's so difficult why do you have to
create straw men mr movie bob is it because these people are boogie men and they don't actually
exist i'm not saying that i'm saying is that possible you should use you should use boogie
person as a gender neutral term i'll just use schloom it'll refer to any person see how that
works it's a dastardly rhetorical sleight of hand and yeah yeah they're dastardly they're being
dastardly that's some heavy irony right there uh the theme of this video is irony how about that
they pull sleight of hand movie bob what did you just do whack whack panther uh what was that about
real in 2018 again see how that works it's a dastardly rhetorical sleight of hand and unscrupulous
culture critics are foisting it on impressionable viewers by the that's what you would do right now
bob wouldn't know what a scruple was if it fit him in his massive ass you want to you want a
culture critic go see uh macintosh again that's he's the official culture critic thousands thanks
to the ubiquity of plot hole criticism maybe if there were less okay let me tell you about supply
and demand asshole if there weren't so many fucking plot holes everywhere you wouldn't have
so many people talking about the plot holes supply and demand that sounds like capitalist thinking
you that's a horrible nazi i love capitalism uh what was that about real in 2018 again see how
that works it's a dastardly rhetorical sleight of hand and unscrupulous culture critics are foisting
it on impressionable viewers by the thousands thanks to the ubiquity of plot hole criticism
none of this of course is to say that there's a wrong way to watch movies or that you yourself are
but
oh man whoops oh whoops um actually um i love it how he i love the straw man cherry picking and
then right after that the thing he says nobody is saying so what actually did say
thanks just a memo there last last week none of this of course is to say that there's a wrong
way to watch movies or that you yourself are part of the problem if you enjoyed a nitpick you just
said we're part of like a major problem that we're meeting people by the wayside with our own
political ideas and you just disagreed with patrick willams who this video is in support of
legitimately says that there is a wrong way to watch movies that that's an unironic thing he says
and enjoy criticism from others bob this movie's a fucking mess and it's inconsistent and you're
just awful at making videos which is why after all of this time that you've spent you get such
little viewership and you're like a meme because you're awful as someone just mentioned as well
it's like he's saying i'm not saying there's anything wrong but he said like the worst on
youtube and what was the what was the search term dumbest shit on youtube nothing wrong with
it it's just the dumbest shit on youtube dastardly rhetorical sleight of hand and unscrupulous
culture critics are foisting it on impressionable viewers by the thousands thanks to the ubiquity
of plot hole criticism none of this of course is to say that there's a wrong way to watch movies
or that you yourself are part of the problem if you enjoyed a nitpick video here or there but i
would agree that broadening your media diet beyond that is always a good idea and rediscovering the
concept of theme and emotional connection what a movie made as if i think even cinema sins might
actually reference emotional connection here and there i don't know i haven't seen all the videos
he's i think movie bob just hates anyone who's more successful and popular than he is
just hates everyone that doesn't doesn't accidentally that's also contemplating the ubiquity
of plot hole criticism i i i criticize a lot of it criticize the plot hole i i mean there's
a lot of it but then again there's a lot of plot holes to criticize so maybe if films were written
better and there weren't plot holes everywhere then that wouldn't be an issue but maybe maybe
you should be encouraging good writing as a movie critic bob maybe that's what you should be doing
he's concluded that this is logical plot hole related inconsistencies versus the assessment
of theme and character which to me is just like who what so why have you separated them like that
as if you can't logically break down a character's progression or something like that
made you feel rather than whether or not the machinery by which it did so played fair or not
is an overdue experience for a lot of us in the words of alfred hitchcock opining on the tendency
of characters in scary or suspenseful movies do not simply go to the cops right away like they do
in real life they don't go to the police because it's boring yeah what that's what well because
hitchcock said it that means it's genius hitchcock said a lot of things about inconsistencies in
stories so he's definitely not the right guy to quote for and let's be honest man like if all is
preventing your story from falling apart is the characters deciding they don't want to go to the
police maybe just for no reason yeah you might want to work on your story yeah i hate this idea
that if you cite like someone goes two plus two equals five hemmingway it's like that doesn't mean
it was smart hitchcock is a human being he's not a god i'm bob and that's the big picture oh one more
thing on monday september 24th 2018 oh thank christ we're done thank god it's funny but rags
you said earlier uh your movie is is bad or something like that in reference to this video
i was gonna correct you i was like i do that all the i do that all the time where i call videos
movies well but the amount of time we spent on this one i think it's safe to say it was basically
a movie yeah it's like i'm watching stuff on a screen and it's just solved um that was bad
that was something what that was let's let's go with conclusions i'll start um bob has is like
one of the most agenda driven youtubers there is like he's clearly motivated by uh politics
and he hates anybody with a different political perspective and he will assume that when they
address media that they must be criticizing it because it didn't support their political position
when i think in reality it's like the reverse like he's actually seeing their politics before
their points if there's someone he disagrees with like uh if it's someone he does agree with like
lindsey ellis as he referenced or patrick williams or just right for example he'll just listen to
their points even if they don't make any he'll just be like assume them for him because their
politics are correct while the people who aren't like sargon automatically inject them into uh
whatever they like sargon's been talking about predator recently just just how the society works
or whatever and like i could imagine movie bob just being like that's not an assessment of predator
and its culture or how it would work assuming stuff we've seen in the movies that is literally
you saying that socialism is bad that's all it is that's all it ever is because you're all you're
just an agenda um and then the actual video here wow he could really use a redraft because the flow
is so confusing in terms of what he's actually trying to say and i i guess that's just how it
works for him and jesus christ the editing is is adhd levels of like are you keeping up i hope you
are it takes so much time to do that shit too yeah and then it takes so much time to get all
those images and he says him so fast that the amount of images he has to go through you just
must be staggering he speaks so fucking fast for no other reason than i can discern other than
he's a part of the escapist who has zero punctuation who speaks fast as well is that it
like i like zero punctuation because he's more funny alex yeah uh man yeah that's that's my
assessment you guys go ahead charbled mess of unnecessary complicated contradictory language
i mean it's just a train wreck from beginning to end he he flip-flops he's inconsistent
he clearly poisons the well and assumes the worst intentions of people he does the thing
that he says is bad to do and then he says it's good now but it's it's a mess man like that was
something else that's a piece of work well i like how i was introduced to these guys first it was
just right back in the day then it was patrick back to bob and with just right he had an actual
philosophy or he had some understanding of not only cinema but storytelling so he's coming from
a theoretical or at least a conceptual view of how to do things even though he's obviously agenda
driven then you have patrick who is sort of kind of half and half i think he has some classical
understanding of of cinema but he's blinded by his bias and his own emotions with of course all the
contradictions along the way with bob it's it's like patrick up to ten you know it's just all
the way how far can we take uh obsession with emotion and and fix and just talk as fast as
possible get as many adjectives as you can with with nouns and predicates and just slam them
together and uh i mean he's not he's not a word salad he's just like a drag racer salad he just
would he said quasi empiricism he must be he doesn't know what he's talking about it's like
say that's that's the the classic example of calling someone uh was an intellectual a quasi
intellectual uh a pseudo intellectual that's a it's a pretty classic insult back in the day
and saying that oh he doesn't really know what he's talking about but he sounds smart
this is exactly what movie bob is he thinks he's smart and he constructs this narrative of words
that i'm having even a problem listening to little and comprehending so
there you go and i i could speak for wolf he's probably would have been dead at this point
blood coming out of his ears um and i was gonna say that we're we're near at four hours so there's
no way we'll be able to do another video um that's enough for me yeah i think we should do this
another time um maybe get uh less nauseating uh people to they're old also yeah it's it's been a
lot of fun i'll say that um you've gone and uh yeah it's a fun analysis i do once a week
how about you rags you may as well throw you throw your hat in the ring why should they subscribe
you should subscribe to me because uh fucking shit
you should subscribe to me because if you don't the terrorists win they go see puts his agenda
and all of his media analysis stuff yeah rags man i was gonna say they probably all subscribe
to you anyway because like you're like essentially on every one of these podcasts so i'm i'm i'm fairly
regular and yeah i will until the end now i'll just be spamming the fucking the second channel
it's called moolah i just make all these things public on there so many links in the chat i hope
you guys can actually follow either way it's been a lot of fun thank you both for for sticking
through for so long that is we've been requested that video a lot and i think it's because people
both want to see movie bob um watched and this particular one he's a he's a very special man
i'll um just get through i think there's like four super chats uh or two sorry um movie bob went on
a jag when he first worked for escapist about how tyler perry was basically reinforcing negative
stereotypes of black people i'm sure you'll find a way to reconcile that with everything else he
said movie bob is um he's got he's got a spaghetti brain with how everything connects i think
i just realized i can give you money i used to do people's fan fictions what are you doing to
movies and people's strange opinions on opinions i used to do people's fan fictions what are you
doing i don't i don't quite follow that but um either way thank you all for the very kind donations
thank you very much rags and smut boy you've been a fantastic guest and we all of course have you
back but the thing is we're doing this once per week and i've already got a few other
potential guests even next week is already we're we're hopefully having the uh cinema sins sins guy
by the way he's gonna come on and uh this will be after he's released his video i'm hoping
we'll have a kind discourse but i think we might actually have our very first debate of sorts we're
gonna be talking about black panther i think the guy who made the video on me um oh yeah that was
a really shit video yeah well he's making a new one and apparently he's going to be coming on next
time or hopefully next week uh once we figure out a time and uh we can talk about black panther
because that will be interesting but the wow we're gonna have some guts no that's a good thing
though we can even like we can make it no bad blood oh yeah it's good but oof he took some
shots at you too he did but i'm willing to let bygones be bygones i'm sure we must have taken
a few shots at him in our in our review i know wolf did so that he could resist it was a response
um but yeah uh so that'll be next week and obviously you can catch these on on the second
channel but other than that i think that's it uh thanks again for coming folks and that's goodbye
