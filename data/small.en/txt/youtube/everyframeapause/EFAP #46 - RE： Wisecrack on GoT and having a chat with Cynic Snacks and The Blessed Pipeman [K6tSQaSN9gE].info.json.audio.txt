The thing with eFap is that we'd like to go live.
Most people think most podcasts should be offline, edited, and then uploaded.
But who likes effort?
Name one person.
To be honest, I think they're two completely different genres, I guess,
because you could put in, quote unquote, more effort and edit it and all that bullshit.
But then you have no audience interaction,
and that kind of makes up a good percentage of the experience for me anyway.
Oh, yeah, I think a podcast would always be improved if you were to...
Like, if we did the show today and then I was to pull it down and I cut out any awkward gaps,
I cut out any, like, uh, flubs of lines or cut out parts where one of us goes and there's a way...
Yeah, all the racist things, you cut them out and you can make a, maybe a much better paced thing.
But you lose, yeah, you lose the audience interaction to a degree.
You can't have that. We need all these crazy people in chat.
There's a reason they're on screen.
We love these people, right?
You guys know all of their names, right?
I know Creamy Sheave and Edward Longshanks and Blessed Southpaw and Theo.
Who was on eFap.
And James Moore.
Oh, yeah, James Moore.
What about James Moore?
Martin Luther Pepe, to see you guys.
There's a lot of, uh, a lot of famous characters in there.
Speaking of famous characters, we got the Blessed Pipeman back on the show.
The legendary...
That was the last time you were on, was with another special guest who shall no longer be named.
That was an interesting time.
I don't know if you, you caught this because there was a, there was like, there's two degrees.
Like, why don't you just have like CJ on as well?
Get the three of them.
It's like, ah, we can't pop that cherry.
That has to be kept for the special episode where Wolf is here as well.
But CJ's had two episodes.
You both have had one.
And now you, you all three of you have had two, which leads us to all threes.
We'll have the three of us host, the three of you host on the third episode that you roll on eFap.
You know, it'll be great.
Three, three, three.
The trio.
I didn't realize you were a commie.
Three isn't commie.
Three?
Well, I just made this three like a communist number.
Why did you associate commies with three?
I mean, it's, it actually kind of was a piece of shit.
Hate him, but it's okay to hate.
I think Jesus would have been okay with that, actually.
Hating is a reasonable thing to do, but yeah, uh, I guess it's a little earlier than usual for me to do this,
but, you know, welcome guest, Aruz.
How are you guys doing today?
Pizza and Oldman?
Doing great.
Things are really awesome.
Not you.
I am not.
You asked the guests.
That's true.
That's true.
You missed.
Oh, Rags, you missed the last two episodes of Efav.
I'm so sorry that you missed debating Spider-Man.
Something that you really, really wanted to be there for.
I was, I was on, no, I was there.
No, you weren't.
Yeah, I was.
Absolutely.
I was there in spirit.
You were the three Efavs ago.
Well, we debated Spider-Man.
We had a double bill of more debates.
No.
With Shadiversity.
Did you check those out?
I don't know if you did or not.
Oh, I, I think I started one.
You promptly tipped them off.
I don't know.
No, no, no.
Something must have came up.
Well.
It's hard.
It's harder for me to listen to Efavs when I'm not part of him.
It's okay.
That's not vain.
That's such a draw.
I tracked my own self as the demographic.
Yeah, yeah.
Your favorite character on Efav is Rags, right?
Yeah, he's great.
Yeah, I'm curious what they're going to do with him in season four.
Oh, yeah.
He's that's that's the shtick though.
I think the fans usually are happier when he's more of a dick.
So the producers aren't sure what to do with it.
Yeah.
Personal failings.
I think he's going to have a character.
It's going to be really good.
But yeah, you've both answered the Star Wars question, right?
The SQ as we call it.
I believe they have.
Yeah.
Remind me.
Maybe again.
See what you think.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
What do we think of the next next next next?
You voted for Finn to be the most inconsistent character.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got one for Vox.
Oh, I do.
You vote for Poe, Professor.
Did I did?
No, you voted for Poe.
I think I voted Poe.
In my mind, I thought Poe was just there wasn't much to his character.
He's a pilot.
And that's it.
That's probably why you thought you'd be inconsistent,
because they'll do something with him.
He's going to drop a tank now.
Because all I know is he flies things, and he really hates the Empire,
but we don't really have much of a backstory for him.
And he comes off.
He comes across as a bit of a terrorist, to be fair.
Well, do you think he's just going to end up in his next round?
He is a terrorist.
He's attacking the standing government.
He's violently trying to change policy against the standing government.
He's absolutely a terrorist.
So, do you think he's going to take up the role of General?
General, you mean?
No, because that's toxic masculinity.
Does Poe have a story?
Oh, yeah, damn.
Sorry.
Yeah, I forgot, but he can't.
Oh, yeah, damn right.
He can't even touch it between his legs.
If he tucks it between his legs, that might create some equality.
If he sits in this special anti-man spread zone.
I'm glad we talk about these things.
How is your podcast going, guys?
Great British-tisms?
We did one last week.
It's been a bit hectic because snacks coming back.
I've had all sorts of personal problems since why I've got my fucking videos out.
But we're still doing a podcast tomorrow, I believe.
And we will be, I don't know, spoil too much.
We haven't signed the NDAs, but fuck it.
We're going to be discussing, and I think you've discussed this as well.
We will be talking about that shitty extra credits video.
Oh, they did so well.
And you become a Nazi.
Yeah, we'll be covering that.
In fairness, I learned a lot from the video.
Did you guys not?
I learned about how I'm a terrible person,
which is something I always love to be told.
You guys, terrorist rule.
I think I lost IQ points.
Nobody liked it.
Nobody on this earth liked that video.
I haven't actually seen anybody defend it.
No, except for them saying, oh, looks like we struck a nerve.
It's like, yeah.
Yeah, that was that was completely their intention.
They knew what they were saying was absolutely just contrived nonsense.
They knew it was going to annoy people.
That's the only reason they did it for attention.
I refuse to believe they believe in any of the points they're making because it's ridiculous.
I mean, they could also be really incompetent.
It's possible.
I suppose maybe I'm giving them too much credit.
I don't know.
Based on what I saw on Twitter, incompetence isn't what I'd call it.
Insanity?
Is that the word you're looking for?
Self-righteous.
Incontinence.
Moral dizzy bodies.
Incontinence, yeah.
Bidspray.
But yeah, I mean, I can't speak.
We're not we don't control the podcast all that much.
We are just the co-hosts.
Yeah, we're mere guests on the podcast.
Yeah, I know all about that.
It's a 3D stream.
He's gotten really big over the past couple of months as well.
He's at 170.
You're trying to say he's fat.
5K subs.
Yeah.
I haven't seen him on Facecam.
I haven't seen him from the top down.
So who knows?
And who is this guy you're talking about?
Some kind of some kind of dog guy?
Oh, shit, he's in chat as well.
God, does he follow you guys around?
Good timing.
Good timing.
He makes, oh, he makes, oh, he makes like video essays on media.
Yeah, who does that?
His videos go over the five minute mark as well.
So whoa, that's just bad.
Yeah, so he couldn't just, he doesn't know how to make a point is what you're saying.
Somebody badded me.
I forget how long man badded you.
I forget who.
Stop long man batting everybody.
What did they do rags?
What did they say?
I could've swore it was in our podcast talk on our discord group for us.
I could swear it was on there.
I'll have to look it up.
Was it about one of your videos?
I don't know.
I can't remember.
Uh, I wish I could.
So CJ made two videos about the new predator movie.
Instead of just making one like I did.
You only need one video to say the movie's bad.
Should've made half of it.
Not even one.
Even though my video I think is longer than his two put together.
He's still stupid.
It doesn't matter.
It's just the amount of videos that matters.
Yeah.
All you need to do is one video per subject.
For example, politics, one video.
Just say which is right.
Because we all know moderation's a delusion.
So it should be pretty easy to.
Moderation.
That read out.
But yes, hi CJ in chat.
Sorry we've stolen your co-hosts for a while.
We like to bring a bit, you know, it's been a bit too American-y on this show.
And it's nice to, you know, get a bit of British blood back in here.
Especially as you say, it is too American-y.
I'm drinking my soothing, delicious, ice cold tea.
Oh, it is so good.
I'm drinking a tequila beer.
A gun and a hamburger.
That'd be very American.
A straw is sort of like a barrel.
It's a food barrel.
I'm sorry.
Is that a single use plastic that you've got there?
No, I use it more than.
Are you trying?
I've got more freedom than this.
He's got more freedom than us.
Let him enjoy it.
Why don't we?
I don't just suck on the straw once and throw it away.
I'll use it for the whole drink.
Does an American bald eagle come and pick up the recycling?
I doubt it.
They probably carry it in a way to the nearest land.
Recycling.
I didn't call it glass anymore.
I was going to say American recycling.
I don't know about that.
You just chuck it in a bit and then.
We recycle.
Not glass.
Not around here, though.
It's too cheap to make, I guess.
So they don't even recycle it anymore.
It's like it's not even worth recycling.
You just make so much glass.
Recycling is just the government trying to get us to recycle.
That's what that is.
We used to have massive glass holes, we'd call them.
And you just dump your glass in the glass hole.
Oh, Wilson Chaswell.
How do you do, sir?
Well, how what is your excuse for being in the chat?
But not being probably in work.
Oh, so you can listen, but you can't talk
loudly constantly for four hours.
He's so funny.
If he was like trying to be the podcast in the background,
they'd be like, excuse me, sir.
And he's like,
go away.
The long man's bad again.
I want to speak to your manager, sir.
I'm the manager.
And then we put until I let me get Jay.
Just like stab the fucking label on here.
It's like, you're the manager.
She's like, she explodes.
No.
Wow.
He called you a mega tard.
Mega tard.
I mean, you like have.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you're an omega tard.
The last of the tard.
What did you what did you say?
You say on your on your videos boxes about something
strength, tard strength, right?
I've said a lot of things.
I've said shit on a chandelier.
I've said tard strength.
Absolutely.
You ever see the way it's hard to fight, man?
It's vicious.
Oh, well, you know, like Mortal Kombat,
like each character has their benefits.
Tard strength is like one of the better ones.
Honestly, I would adopt it.
It's like you have to do down right.
Tard strength artistic Andy on my show.
He's got the most.
When is he taking over the show?
I think the old dude is like, he's just losing out.
I want to hear Andy's take on on most things.
I'd love to hear.
I'd love to see the funeral episode when you finally pop
your clogs toss pop and then autistic Andy's giving
your obituary.
That'd be that'd be a good one.
No spoilers.
It's funny.
Autistic Andy is a fan favorite.
Everyone loves autistic Andy and especially the shit
that comes out of his mouth.
Like coked up pussy is the best pussy.
No one really expects that from him.
But I've floated around the idea of maybe,
maybe letting him have maybe one episode where you can talk
about something that interests him.
But we'll see.
And I'm the star.
I'm the star.
Boxes productions, that's me.
What if you have a heart attack?
Shut up.
We need that episode now, but then you had a clone.
There's going to be a very long narrative.
You need like a really long tracking shot as well at the
funeral that goes past all of the key characters from your
cinematic universe.
And you need to try and make the budget beat that one shot
from the unnamed characters funeral in the most recent
Avengers movie.
Spoiler alert.
I think you can spoil it at this point.
Oh, Tony Stark.
It kills Dumbledore.
You know what?
There probably is one guy at least like just in the thousand
people who are watching around.
There probably is one guy who hasn't seen Endgame yet and
just hoping that no one talks about spoilers.
And he's like, oh, I was going to watch it today.
Sorry guy.
Fucking far from home is already out like that.
They're on to the next movie already.
Where are you guys talking about Infinity War?
Endgame.
Spider-Man is already out.
Have you seen that yet, Rex?
Yeah.
No, I haven't.
No, it was all right.
Let's try not spoil it then.
Even though someone in chat will spoil it now.
That's right.
I don't give a shit about that.
So I don't ever listen to anything they say.
I'd give it like seven out of 10.
I think it was pretty good.
I give you a seven out of 10.
That's fine.
I'm fun.
Like, oh, well, I mean, all right.
Personally, I don't think I'd be happy with a seven out of 10.
That seems kind of that seems a little low ball.
Yeah, I'd be like, what's the problem?
What's the problem?
Well, I mean, I mean, nothing's a 10 ever.
So yeah, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I've been hearing a lot about the boys lately.
It's just TV show.
Have you guys seen anything about that?
Um, I read the comic.
I read the comic that it was based on the graphic.
Sorry, graphic novel.
I didn't ask if you were a nerd.
I asked if you saw the TV show.
Uh, I, I, I saw the, um, no, I avoiding it because it feels
like they're not gonna, it's gonna be crap.
If you've, I've heard that it's good.
I've heard that it's good.
So maybe you're wrong.
Oldman.
Okay.
Look, you guys, do you guys separate adaptation quality
from writing quality?
Or do you think they're intrinsically tied together?
Oh, Jesus.
It depends because, um, you always like the original source.
But it's why people don't like the new Star Wars films
because they feel they disrespect the source material,
which yes, our films.
It is the source material though.
The new ones are the source.
I'm just saying the medium is different.
If we're comparing a TV show to a comic book, then yeah,
there's going to be, there has to be some changes because of
the medium of vision, um, making TV shows and films
and all the technical stuff and books and things like that.
Distilling the story to fit.
So if you've got like a novel and then you're shrinking it down
to be, you know, an hour and a half, two hours of screen time,
you're going to have to emit a lot of information.
And it's that process of deciding what gets cut and what doesn't.
That's, that's kind of important.
And you always, as, as a reader of the books or graphic novels
or whatever, you always feel disappointed by that one kind of image
or idea from the original story that you really liked
not being represented.
And then that, that kind of gives you a foul kind of feeling from the spoilers.
I got, I could be wrong here, but someone said they cut something
from the TV series, which is right.
In the comic book is very important.
That is a blowjob, a forced blowjob.
And I can understand why they it's more like if you want this job,
you have to suck my dick.
Now, in the age of hashtag me too, that might be a plot element
that disagrees with modern audiences.
So I think they have to compromise for political reasons,
given the climate.
So that's always something you're going to have problems with.
I'll sum it up with a simple question.
If you have a terrible adaptation on your hands,
would it be well written?
What, the, the, the screenplay?
Sure.
It's because there's so many different areas that it could fail
that lead it to as an overall package being bad,
but the screenplay itself could be a good adaptation.
Like to give you an example, you just take like,
I'm assuming you guys like the Dark Knight, right?
Yeah.
If we just took that movie and renamed him the Spider-Man
and he was called Peter Parker instead of Bruce Wayne.
It would be like the worst adaptation of Spider-Man in the world.
But would you say the film is still well written?
Uh, well no, because it's not true to the themes and characters of the story.
Like it can still technically be, it could technically be well made
and the story could follow a structure and tickle the boxes,
but it's not correct.
So what you're saying is you'd have the Batman movie,
but he doesn't call himself Batman,
or maybe he does call himself Batman,
but instead he dresses up as Spider-Man?
Well, no, it's a Spider-Man movie,
but it's exactly shot for shot, the Dark Knight.
Right, okay.
So, so Peter Parker would see his parents get shot
and that makes him want to be a photographer.
Yeah, he wants to, he wants to shoot people in a different way.
There we go.
Yeah, see, you can, now that's an adaptation.
I can see the Hollywood book, the Hollywood big bucks landing on the,
on the office table there.
Yeah, do that.
No one gives a fuck about it.
I think with the whole, with this whole kind of like Spider-Man
multiverse thing that Marvel are clearly trying to pursue,
it wouldn't be beyond reason to think they might do something like that one day.
I'm not surprised.
It seems with a lot of reboots,
when they write themselves in the corner, they go,
ah, fucking hell.
Multiverse, time travel.
Multiverse, yeah.
We set to zero every, it's done so much that it's become cliche.
It's almost expected now.
How can they own this time travel?
They should bring back the, it was all a dream plot line.
I think that's really grossly mis- underused these days.
You know what, the stupid thing is,
I could see some fart-huffing pseudo-intellectual.
You know what, it does, it needs to come back
because it actually really subverts your expectations.
In fact, if anything, it's a subversion.
You expected Spider-Man to be in a Spider-Man movie.
This subverted your expectations.
There's a whole like two and a half hours with no Spider-Man.
I mean, so just because again,
I'm not going to spend like a podcast on this or anything,
just one closing element.
And all I wanted is like a,
essentially a yes or no from you guys,
and then we'll move right along.
So I'm just curious what you guys think.
If you were to complain about this theoretical movie,
where a man, a hero called Spider-Man,
was doing everything in the dark night,
and you were like, is bad,
because, and then you highlight all these contradictions,
would that be in the category of poor adaptation,
or poor writing, or both?
Or either, you know, I think you get what I'm saying, right?
Because where I'm trying to lead you
is that I would maintain that it's still well-written,
but it's a piss-poor adaptation.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
You'd agree with that?
Yeah, that's totally agree, yeah.
All right, that's it.
That's all I wanted to say.
It's okay.
People in chat will be upset with that.
It's fine.
I just wanted to go over it quickly,
because I know people would be like,
you've got to acknowledge.
Well, people in chat will be happy and sad.
It's a whole collection.
I'm just trying to say, I want to acknowledge,
so that people don't feel like we're trying
to avoid the subject.
But real quick, right?
And this is the reason why I think the people
of Efap being me, Rags Wolf,
and I know Fringy definitely does,
a few other people as well.
Please.
We maintain that Hill House is a terrible adaptation,
but a really great show.
Lord of the Rings is a great adaptation,
and a great movie.
The Shining is a terrible adaptation,
but a great movie.
But a great movie, yeah.
Doom with the Rock, terrible adaptation,
and a terrible movie is just terrible.
Twilight is a good adaptation,
but a terrible movie.
You see how you can get all full possibilities,
and it just assists the conversation
from our end if we talk about it that way.
The Twilight books are so bad,
it's like they're perfect for a terrible movie, you know?
You want to make a terrible movie,
adapt these faithfully, like okay.
Yeah, hopefully that clears it up.
Anyway, we can move to whatever else I had planned today,
which who knows, it's a complete mystery.
Have you guys-
I hope it's a walrus with a top hat.
Did you guys hear about how Daisy Ridley
was at a friend's birthday party?
You can find an article for this.
Apparently, someone came up to her to tell her,
they were like,
I love the new Star Wars movie, Force Awakens.
She was like, oh yeah, thank you.
And then they said, didn't like The Last Jedi though.
And apparently, Daisy Ridley was like,
can people not do this?
It's rude.
That was like, okay.
Why?
She said-
I'm sorry for having an opinion about a piece of,
I'm not even gonna say art,
because I nearly threw up a piece of work you were in.
She said something like,
it's rude to say that because it's her job or something.
And I was like-
No, it's not.
If someone does a crap job,
then you can tell them about it.
Well, what else are you gonna say?
If it's like, a lollipop man is directing children
into oncoming traffic,
but you can't criticize it.
He's like, excuse me, that's my job.
Like, is he made of lollipops?
I don't understand.
Why can't you say lollipop person?
You know, I'm not the lollipop man.
The lollipop man.
What the fuck is a lollipop?
Oh shit, wait, wait.
Yeah, do Americans have lollipops?
Basically, it's an old man.
Is there a good man?
And he's got loads of lollipops,
and he gives them to kids,
and he leads them into oncoming traffic.
He sounds like a dick.
No, it is the fence.
He does hand out three lollipops.
So, no, there's people that tend the roads
outside of elementary schools,
and they've got a big, like, sign on a stick
that looks like a giant lollipop,
and they stop the sticks.
But they call it, they carry it around.
Do you guys have zebra crossings in America?
Well, what zebra crossings?
Oh yeah, that's right.
That's what you call that animal.
I mean, zebras over there.
We call them, I think we call them just crosswalks.
Right, well, I was just going to say,
because, like, the idea is, like,
a lollipop man can essentially,
a lollipop man, like, can spawn one of those
if he walks out of the road.
Oh, sorry, guys.
We need to stop for one second.
It's lollipop person.
Yeah, that's what I said.
That's what I said earlier.
We don't want to get cancelled.
Because there are lollipop
women's as well as men's.
So you have to collect them up.
I don't know if I take a lollipop from a women.
Pride wouldn't taste the same.
I want a man's lollipop.
I don't want a lady's lollipop.
The views of ranks do not necessarily reflect
the views of every frame of pause.
They don't necessarily, but they do.
I would take a lollipop from any person.
Maybe not, actually.
What about Osama bin Laden?
Well, he's dead, so that'd be quite the feat.
I don't know, mate.
He was buried with his favorite lollipop.
What if he had some pretty damn good lollipops?
You don't know.
Oh, you just don't trust him.
Well, lollipops are one of the four things
in the world not forbidden by the Quran.
So he really, really likes to sell lollipops.
What kind of Middle Eastern flavored lollipops could you get?
Goat.
I don't know.
Oh, God.
I'm picturing, like, intestine on, like, a...
Yeah, nah.
Let's not.
C4 flavored?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I don't see why not.
Try it, at least.
So did you guys ever hear about the legal video
covering Captain Marvel?
Yeah.
You've heard of it.
Yeah, that was fun.
I didn't get mad at all.
We never actually got to cover...
He made a partial response in his comment section.
Here is a link.
Oh, the lawyer guy.
Lawyerman, yes.
Oh, he's not really a lawyer.
He's on YouTube, so I don't know how much we could assume.
I've only watched one of his videos,
and he kept shilling for custom bespoke suits.
Oh, is that a problem?
Do you hate suits now?
No, but I'm just saying that's the content.
I don't wear clothes, so kind of...
Does he have qualifications in bird lore?
Bird lore?
Like, is he...
Well, what's a...
What is an ornithologist?
That's what they're called, right?
Yep, that's...
An orthodontist.
A bird artist?
An orthopedist?
Someone who draws birds as an orthodontist?
So, just a quick refresher.
He basically argued that because the Dawn touched her map,
she had full right to engage in self-defense
to the point of electrocuting and nearly breaking his arm,
threatening to maim him and steal his stuff.
Oh, yeah, that public innocent man
that she beat to near death.
Yeah.
His video is absolutely insane.
But check it out.
He's made a response.
Rags, do you want to take the lead,
or do you want me to do it?
I would actually love to hear his response to
all the people who hated his shitty video.
All right.
Wow.
Looks like we have some strong feelings
about a fictional superhero.
Let me stop you right there.
Fictional superheroes,
if they're real-life superheroes.
I don't know...
Yeah, there's fire fighters and police officers.
Well, they're heroes.
Superheroes is the whole point
that they have supernatural abilities.
You can't have real superheroes.
Donald Trump is a superhero.
Let me address some of the most common comments.
Common comments is another thing to see back to back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Grabbing a map isn't harmful.
He says, probably true.
Probably true.
Probably true.
Okay.
I like it's probably true.
Where is the map?
Is it inside you right now?
I was going to say, without context,
that depends.
If we pull a map out of somebody's belly,
like they've eaten it,
then yeah, that'd be harmful.
Fair enough.
In the context...
In the context...
So I ate a map.
The comment is obviously made
in context of this video,
but he's like,
you know, in a general sense,
maybe, maybe not.
You know, there might be a scenario
where grabbing someone's map
could cause them real physical damage.
It's like, you know,
saying hello isn't harmful,
but if you shout hello
into somebody's eardrum directly,
then yeah, that could be harmful.
He's got a point.
He says, probably true,
but I'm mainly arguing
the offensive touching point.
That the motorcycle guy
committed battery
should be pretty uncontroversial
among lawyers.
Famous cases of offensive touching
include snatching a plate
out of someone's hand
and taking a necklace off of someone.
Both of those are much worse
than what happened
in the context of the DARD.
Yeah.
Not really a stretch
to extend those cases
to what happens here.
Reasonable minds can differ though,
and indeed they do.
So in those cases,
did any of the people
resort to using a photon blast
in their hand or whatever?
Yes, that famous case of 84.
Someone had their plate stolen,
so they blasted him in the face
with laser beams.
Love the idea of him trying
to pitch this to a jury
who are just giving him
the weirdest looks like,
are you actually defending this
as self-defend?
Like they have the video
in the courtroom of her doing it.
They're like, I don't want
he's like, really, you know, clearly
gently touched her map.
How do we know
she actually electrocuted him?
He could be faking it.
He could be faking this.
And then didn't she steal
his bike as well?
Yeah, and his his clothing.
Like his helmet and his jacket.
You know, like in the Terminator
where the people say,
well, the timid did it.
You guys did have a problem with that.
It was a killer robot did it.
Reminded me of how stupid
this whole discussion was.
There was there was that tweet
that had like over two hundred
thousand likes or whatever that said.
I probably better getting angry
than a woman defended herself.
What?
Okay.
How can you justify
her stealing the motorcycle?
He says, I'm not.
I thought it would be clear
that one crime doesn't justify another.
I'm just pointing out
that commandeering a vehicle
is a common wish fulfillment
trope in action movies.
No, you can't steal from someone
when they commit an unrelated
tort against you.
I don't actually remember
him in the video saying
that it was bad.
I don't remember him talking
about the motorcycle part.
I thought he avoided it
because he knew he could defend it
gloss right over it
because it would make her
the villain.
Yeah, even addressed it.
All right.
So the use of force
wasn't proportionate.
He says, I agree.
That's why I explicitly
say that not all
of the force was justified,
but it's just just
a percentage of it.
I don't even work.
Her force was binary.
It would be like if I
find six shots at rags
and someone goes,
not all of the bullets
were justified.
It's like, what?
She electrocuted or she didn't.
That was it.
But it's a colourable moment.
It's a colourable argument
to some force just.
But it's a colourable argument
that some force was justified.
And I disagree with that.
I don't think any force
was justified based
on what we know.
It would be insane to think
that force is justified
against somebody who
gently touched your map
to talk to you
and then you offer them a handshake.
If you would have shoved them away,
that would have been
disproportionate for us.
Captain Marvel electrically
shocks the motorcycle guy.
The equivalent in real life
might be using a stun gun.
Would using a stun gun
be appropriate?
Maybe no, maybe not.
Absolutely not.
PSA guys do not
stud the stun gun a person
who put their hand on a bat.
How do you like?
Is there a formula
for figuring out the exact
proportionate amount of force
to use in retaliation
to his actions?
And does the fact that he
that he's a white man
add a multiplier to that figure?
Yes, it does.
You could do any
you could do anything you want
to a white man
who touches your map.
So he touches your map,
which has a value of two
and it was probably free.
You multiply that by 10,
so you can actually return
retaliate 30 force.
Well, it's proportionate.
It's not exact.
It's more of the principle.
So if he touches your map,
you could like steal his pamphlet
or something like that.
You can take one of his
like he crumples your thing.
You can double crumple in response.
Yeah, like you can
wipe your ass with it.
Did you?
But then does he get to steal
some her bike then?
No, no, no.
Now it's the end of the turn.
If he tried that,
she would literally delete.
Do not go.
It's so stupid.
Could she pull a milkshake
on him for that?
You could try that
with her, but that's, you know,
you never know what
she's going to do.
Maybe she's powered by that.
In fairness, her powers
originated from something
getting splattered on her.
So yeah, this guy's
fucking ridiculous.
He says thanks to the person
that posted the jury instructions
on self-defense in California.
I literally don't care
about California's bullshit laws,
but you can argue that
all three elements are met.
You can argue that
not all three elements are met.
What if she just pushed him away
and justified her?
No, I would still be
like, that's a bit of a strange response.
I think it's a bit of an overreaction.
Yeah, I will be okay with it.
Like push him and he'd fly through the air
and land in a building
and die or something, but all right.
So if I bump into someone
on the sidewalk, that's battery.
He says no, because one,
the relevant intent to commit
the touching is missing.
And two, the touching
isn't offensive or harmful.
Commit the touching.
Whoa, I don't know that
someone bumps into me on the sidewalk.
I could definitely say that's offensive.
Why not?
He says this would never go to trial.
True, but so what?
Just because something isn't prosecuted
doesn't mean it's not technically a crime.
So much to let us into proven guilty
then fuck off.
She's invincible,
so it can't be battery.
Oh my God.
No, he didn't actually say this.
This is not an argument.
Hang on, hang on.
So crimes can go off the hook.
If you punch someone and thought,
oh, I actually thought
this person was invincible.
I just happened to punch someone
who wasn't invincible.
This is crazy.
They're mental gymnastics.
I did this guy pass the bar.
That's what I want to know.
Okay, so to the to the quote,
she's invincible,
so it can't be battery.
He says, imagine shooting a gun
at someone wearing a bulletproof vest.
Okay, do we need to explain
how that's not the same?
We are skipping to the next one.
That is retarded.
So many ways to prove a stupid.
She wasn't physically damaged.
That would be relevant
for a civil case,
but not necessarily
for a criminal case.
The important point
is the intent and the act,
which we view
from the standpoint of the assailant.
He intended to.
Gently move her map
down and talk to her.
I mean, the whole point
was that he wanted to see
her face when he talked to her.
He's a monster being rude.
I if you if anyone out there
ever finds yourself
in a courtroom
meeting to defend yourself.
You're not higher.
This man is insane.
He is he is arguing
that shooting someone
with a bulletproof vest
means you weren't trying to kill them.
Or something like that.
You'd be like, I don't.
Also, we're replying the laws
of our planet
onto this clearly fantasy story.
Is there anything in the MCU canon
that says that their law system
is identical to our law system?
Because otherwise
this is a fucking waste of time anyway.
Um, I don't.
Maybe in the next Black Widow film
they'll all be courtroom drama.
If someone will show us on the map
where he touched it.
This happens in Shazam actually.
I don't know if you guys have seen it,
but they test out shooting him
once they find out he's bulletproof
and they're having a lot of fun with it.
Yeah.
And it's like that would be different
than shooting someone
with a bulletproof vest
because even one shot
is going to probably bruise
them pretty significantly.
Oh yeah.
But Shazam's having fun
while getting shot
because it literally does nothing
to him.
So there's definitely relevance to that.
But then also like the fact that
he's there wearing the vest
doesn't change the fact
that you're firing
a deadly weapon at them.
Yeah, well, I guess that's
I realize like that's kind of
what his point is that the fact
that she's an invincible guard
doesn't change the fact
that he committed battery
by which he pulled her map down.
I know I don't think we should
lose ground on that.
That's not battery.
No, because I think that a reasonable jury
would be like, no, that is relevant.
The fact that she's an invincible
guard means that he can't
really commit battery
by touching a man.
No, he can't harm her.
He can't he lacks the capacity
to harm her in any way.
And she knows it's on here.
No, no, no, because so is it
is it down to the individual strength
of how much they are allowed
to be beaten up for it
to be considered
very degrees of assault?
It is like a really tiny
really tiny little child
and then a giant fucking muscular man
and you're punching both of them
really hard in the face.
Like surely you'll get different results
in terms of court for sure.
It's the same thing as if someone has
that like that bone disease
the guy has in the sixth sense
or not sixth sense unbreakable.
If you push him over being an orphan.
Yes, breakable.
If you push him over,
he could end up in hospital
for like weeks or months.
While if you push one of us over,
we go hey, don't do that.
So like the person's state
is rather than pushing
the person pushing.
If they don't know that.
Does that change
how they are prosecuted?
They probably see the person
of what they aim to do and accomplish.
I was arguing her response.
She's fully aware.
She's the superpower God
for the idea that she can go.
I responded in kind,
so disproportionately.
Yeah, it's like I responded in kind
because he committed battery
against me.
It's like you're a fucking God.
Shut up.
It would be like if an adult,
like if a child gently
tapped you on the shoulder
and you punched him in the face.
Yeah, and then you said the child
could be like stole his bike
and then stole his bike
and then ate his ice cream.
The little shit.
Yeah, I hate kids.
So innocent anyway.
So yeah, anyway.
What a straight man.
What a terrible.
I don't want this person
near a courtroom.
Well, you're right.
He's on YouTube.
Thank God.
That's right.
He's not like actually a lawyer
or anything.
He's probably got a team of writers
who thought let's let's
this is meaning at the moment.
Let's let's write this thing
and now he's had to do
some damage control.
That means a lot of people
had to come together
for this level of stupid.
It wasn't just a product
of one person.
It was a team effort.
So this next bit is calling.
Toneloke Tonels on Twitter
actually like worked.
He actually responded to somebody.
You see this.
I had to snapshot.
This is so funny.
So down the press says
I'm going to be rather loud
and passionate in the next video,
which is releasing on the channel
about 30 minutes.
And then cool on Connor said
Mr. Totaled.
So happy to see you continue
to make quality content.
Keep it up, man.
Just make sure to take it easy as well.
Don't overwork yourself
and he responded.
Thank you.
I don't know if he thinks
it's just a meme to add old
on the end of any word,
but I have no idea.
It could be both.
That's the magic of tonaled.
It could be both.
It could be neither.
Who knows?
I just I love it.
Thank you.
That's how you interact
with people.
By the way, like the people
that we cover regularly
is to not like antagonize them
or be an asshole to them.
Oh yeah.
Um, and there's a thing, you know,
maybe one day we can get him on here,
but as far as he's aware,
if app is hate content,
so we'll have to convince him otherwise.
Dastardly hate mongers.
Though, um.
Rimming.
Anyway, here is a link
to the watch together, folks.
We've got a very interesting video.
The first one today.
Oh, it's more dolphin porn.
No, no, no.
We do that offline.
I love dolphin porn.
Stop it.
Makes me wet.
So there is the director of.
Jazam releases YouTube videos
every once in a while
talking about films and stuff.
I believe I should have looked into this,
but I can't remember
if he like started on YouTube
and thus he eventually got
to like mainstream movies
for himself and see
like just like Chris Stockman.
So the idea is he's made this video
and I find what he talks about
quite interesting and we'll be able
to use it as a vehicle
for discussion.
The context is obviously
that he's finished making Shazam
and then you've got to make a YouTube video
and so he's going to talk about some stuff
and we're going to give it a listen.
I need to fill up my beverage.
I'll be right back.
That's OK.
The title is the problem
solving of filmmaking.
And then he actually has a bit of criticism
for video essays at one point
and it's very friendly criticism.
I find it quite funny, actually.
Good shit.
But I guess, you know,
we can wait.
Oh, don't worry, Southpaw.
It's not particularly.
Well, I guess you could say
it's about Shazam,
but he's trying to make a wider point
about filmmaking in general.
He's using Shazam as an example.
He's going to be fun.
How are you guys doing?
Did you think Captain Marvel
was the best of all the MCU heroes so far?
Submit it.
If by best you mean
the most powerful, then yeah.
Do you like it when she would learn
to fly in her movie?
You see her movie.
I've not watched.
I've not watched all the way through.
I'm going to be honest.
I can't be honest.
Oh, that little stick in my head
is my name is Carol.
That's the triumphant moment.
I want to speak to your manager.
I did laugh in the cinema
when that happens.
I was expecting you to say.
I was going to say I was expected
to say I am Captain Marvel,
but again, you'd be like,
there's not much weight behind that
because I don't even know.
You were captain of anything, really?
He was the captain of
the particular project.
I think she was in here.
I hear actual little airplane jet thing
said Captain Carol Dan was on it.
It said Avenger.
Also that bull.
I mean, she kind of created the Avengers.
I don't know if you guys knew that.
Yeah, pretty awesome.
She's amazing.
Imagine if they'd given it a different name
because they come up with all sorts of names
for planes that are stupid.
They come staying.
I'll call them the Enola gays.
I saw that.
All right, is everyone ready
for this amazing video?
I've said in the past
that the movie making is nothing
but problem solving,
and I wanted to give an example of that
because with problem solving,
you might think only of big problems,
like how do you make someone fly?
The answer to that is you get a bunch
of stunt guys in blue
and strap the actor to a giant tuning fork.
Then VFX artists spent months and months
painting out everything that's blue.
And for months, you look at this shot
over and over scrutinizing
every pixel around Shazam,
and you're so focused on that
that you don't notice until way too late
that there are crew members
still in the shot standing around.
You know, funny enough,
on first glance in the shot,
to me, they just look like onlookers.
Yeah, like they are onlookers.
You know, not crew members, though.
So the lanyards that go around
there next to kind of make me think like,
Hmm, interesting, but I could get by.
Yeah.
And, you know, of course,
they would be looking at him.
They'd be like,
What the fuck is this dude doing?
Like flying shit.
Now there's no time to paint them out.
There's just enough time to add
some bags and a mop.
Now they're customers and janitors.
Good shit.
Like it.
Yeah.
I guess over here is a blind and deaf convention
since no one reacts to the flying man.
Oh, he's taking a shot at cinema scenes.
Look at that fail counter.
Film failures.
That would even make sense as criticism
because they were looking at Shazam,
would they?
Yeah, they were clearly looking at him.
You could say it for the people
going up the escalator, I guess,
but even, you know, they might be busy
with the going up the escalator.
And I mean, like if I had seen that,
I'd I'd probably be a little dumbfounded
and I wouldn't quite know how to react.
Yeah, I would.
Every human's reaction to something
like that isn't going to be,
Oh, run away from the thing.
Like,
made people freeze up when there are natural
disasters.
If there's a fire in your building,
people freeze up and like the people
have this sense of denial to their nature.
A lot of the times in terms of how
they actually react to potential calamities.
Like, I don't think this is really a calamity,
though, I think in a modern sense.
Well, I'm not saying it is.
I'm just I'm like, if you talk things
like fires or natural disasters,
something a lot of people think
it can't possibly be real.
It's not what it actually is.
And they go back to what they were doing.
Yeah, if I saw this guy,
I would say I would say you'd think,
Oh, this is a cosplayer.
Oh, I wonder what he's fucking selling.
They must be filming something over there.
And I mean, technically there are, but yeah.
So in the movie at this point,
the bad guy, the big bad guy
is actually there causing drama.
And that's what they're fleeing from.
And Shazam is trying desperately
to figure out how to use his damn powers.
Yes.
So that's kind of the context of that.
They're not fleeing from him trying to fly.
As much as in the sense,
it's probably like, you know, tens of millions.
It must suck to be the punching bag
of the internet critic community.
Like, yeah, we suck. Fine.
Jeez.
Back to the flying man.
But every scene will have its own problems to solve,
no matter how simple the scene.
In Shazam, there's a scene
where Billy runs away from his foster home.
Oh, he's an orphan.
Yes, there's a minute.
He actually asked for this.
Friends run after.
Got that bone density urn on.
They tell the other foster kids
to stay home in case Billy comes back.
He's going to talk about like the reasoning
for why this is the way it is.
And then it's pretty cool.
Inside the house, another foster kid
is still getting ready
and wonders what's going on.
Wait, I thought we were running after Billy.
No.
I got to pause just in case there is copyright for this,
but because I don't know if he's because it's his movie
that he got to upload as much as he wanted or not.
Well, he's also put it inside this like framing device
as well of like the old TV.
He has to protect his own stuff against YouTube.
And ironically, it's probably actually.
In fairness, he probably doesn't have the right
to do this with it.
He might not.
Oh, yeah, no, not at all.
Yeah.
Oh, no, he does fair use,
but the bot that won't stop the bots.
Yeah, you can't just say that.
He's just like, I actually made this film.
It'll be funny with it.
And then shortly after the bad guy shows up.
Spoiler alert, by the way, everyone.
Oh, yeah.
This is like three quarters of the way through the film.
Oh, well, we're learning things about filmmaking.
It's with I'm sure most people don't pay too much attention
to a scene like this,
but there are some questions that could be asked.
Like, what's the point of having three of the kids run out
with jackets on only for them to go back inside?
If we have to see them in the scene,
why not place them in the window?
And why leave the fourth kid inside the house?
Now we have to waste time and have a character
explain to her what's going on.
Of course, in the script, the kids were all in the window.
So here's what happened.
The costume department came to me saying,
hey, the kids go from this scene to the Rock of Eternity
to the carnival.
So what they wear in this scene is what they'll wear
for the rest of the movie.
And most of that will be outdoors in winter.
So I've seen this film and there are plenty of times
they can get clothes on through those moments.
Bad guy does capture them and keep them in the house.
But then when they go to the Rock of Eternity,
whether it's through this door and it's after the bad guys left them,
so they could easily grab coats along the way.
And you might be like, they grab coats?
Then you just have, yeah, they grab coats along the way.
It's cold.
So what he's talking about here is a little bit like,
I don't even know that I would think it's that necessary
as a big explanation for how they had coats in these scenes.
I just like, yeah, okay.
But even still, like it's not a continuous narrative.
Like it is broken up and there are cutaways.
And so to think, oh, the continuity,
like where did they get their coat from?
Like I wouldn't even really notice
because you're not with them the entire time.
So it's not beyond the pale to consider.
I don't even think that I typically,
unless it's something that is relevant,
like a sword or a gun or something like that.
Something like an effect.
Yeah, like the fact they have a coat.
I'm like, they're hotter now than they would have been.
There's loads of reasons for these kind of fuckups
on a behind the scenes technical scale.
Like, for example, if those jackets were designer jackets,
they may have had some funding from that side company going,
you gotta have these in shop for,
cause you know, they're paying some of the bills for this.
So then they're a poor family.
So they couldn't be able to wear designer clothing.
Also, you could have had the parents drink fucking Starbucks.
Things just go amiss.
And that's why you have these fucking runners empty fucking cups.
You could have had the parents leave and they're like,
you guys stay and it's like, okay.
And then they just have a talk for about one minute
and conclude the kids.
We're going to go help find him too.
We have to.
He's our brother.
Then cut to next scene and they've all got fucking coats on.
I was going to say, they could put their coats on
as the villain comes in.
Then they're like, oh, fuck.
There's a lot of ways to assault.
You didn't need it to be like, this is what I mean.
That's all.
But I think that's the point of this video
is that everyone problem solves in different ways, I suppose.
Yeah.
At least he's not paying attention to this kind of thing.
That's nice to hear.
Yeah.
I think this is fascinating to hear from filmmakers.
You know, like, oh, he's the director.
So he could have told.
I mean, this is in terms of the hierarchy.
He could have told the costume department.
Well, no, this makes no sense.
You're fucking up my movie.
Why?
Why?
You just come to me and said they have to wear all these outfits out.
Who says?
Is it because you have to design extra outfits?
No, go get back to your fucking wardrobe.
Right.
That's it.
Everyone coats on for the entire movie.
I don't care where you are.
Everyone.
And if you have a coat, see what you've done.
See what you've done.
Costume department now.
Now you're sowing seeds of discontent.
You fuck this movie.
I'm going to make a YouTube video about you.
You can't give me your names.
Give me a fucking day.
Get more coats.
You know what?
That's your job for today.
Fuck off and get me more coats.
You enough fucking tell me.
Okay.
I'm doing a movie.
I'm doing some very.
I'm making lots of money.
Fuck it.
Fuck it.
Yeah.
Get your coats.
Kids.
Get your coats on.
Little Miss County over here says.
Yeah.
I took to the plot, apparently.
Because she made it as a screenwriter as well.
Winter.
So these kids need to be wearing winter clothes.
Well, all right.
So you think about it.
Here's the solution.
Let's say the kids all put on their jackets to run after Billy,
but then Rosa tells them to stay behind in case Billy decides to come back.
Now they're in winter clothes.
And if the bad guy shows up right away, they'll still be wearing them.
Even if.
And he's got his winter clothes on too.
Everyone's got their clothes checked.
Take off their clothes right inside the door.
But yeah, maybe they were so distraught that their brother ran away that they forgot.
Oh yeah.
They look so distraught.
Let's do that.
But hang on.
This exterior location is scheduled to shoot early on.
And turns out we don't have Faith who placed Darla because she's still on another show.
She'll be available when we shoot the interior on a sound stage,
but she won't be available here.
Well, shit.
Okay.
Let's say she was really slow with tying her shoes.
So she never got outside in time.
Of course, on the day you realize that her shoes are actually velcro.
So there's no tying laces.
And I guess Darla is just really slow in general.
Anyway, there's a reason why Darla is inside.
And there's a reason why the kids are all sweating in their winter clothes when they're indoors.
It's done.
I guess there's no such thing as a coat rack in this house.
Then of course.
Leave cinnamon scents alone.
It's not a coat rack in my house, don't worry.
I really don't like the fact that that's kind of
got an outreach further than their own videos.
You know, it's a motif now.
It's a motif sometimes say something that's like, oh, that's a thing.
You know, sometimes.
It happens.
I don't know.
I've heard about it in about six years.
I only ever watch it a part of eFap.
So rack in this house.
Then of course, in hindsight, you look at the movie and realize that, oh yeah,
there's actually a bit of a time jump from the house to when they show up in the rocket
fraternity.
So you could have just had the kids show up in jackets.
That wouldn't have been too crazy if they put jackets on before they went into a weird cave.
I mean, if audiences didn't care about the disappearing backpack in lights out.
This is really passive aggressive.
This is how you didn't care about this.
Well, at least for me, it's about this.
It's about coats.
What?
Yeah.
Is this autism?
Because I know he's highlighting problems you can have in filmmaking.
That's all it is.
It's a nice photo.
I like to think for like, after he made the film, he went home and he sat there for a while.
And he was just like, really sweating about the fact that the coat scene made
not didn't make much sense.
And he's like, I need to make a YouTube video about this before someone criticizes me.
Cinema sins.
They're gunning for me.
Those
Yeah.
Ryan Johnson making a similar video about his choices in the last chapter.
Oh, my God.
That would be sick.
Can you imagine?
It turns out none of it was his fault.
He explains like how his script is really good.
It was all set problems that caused the film.
And then Isaac's turned up and he had velcro shoes on.
So that meant that we had to fuck up the entire film.
Luke was supposed to be this heroic character, but Mark was just depressed most of the day.
What can you do?
He was depressed because he was in annihilation.
He wasn't.
Don't lie to me.
Yeah, he was.
Yeah, he was.
Mark Hamill?
No.
No, no, no.
Last time I was like.
Oh, right.
Yeah, I was saying Mark Hamill was all sad face.
And that's why he was he was that in the movie.
Ryan Johnson intended for him to be heroic and shit.
Oh, well.
The more you know.
Do you think you ever get him on Efap?
Oh, easily.
Mark Hamill, if you would like to come to Efap.
No, no.
Ryan Johnson.
Ryan Johnson.
He'd never be welcome.
He wouldn't if he ever, he just no.
But yes, I would happily have him on.
But he wouldn't.
That would never happen.
Bring a whole scene later.
Never say never.
He's making a new film.
And that's so maybe like, hey, hey, Ryan, I've got this podcast.
We discussed films and you've got a new film coming out.
Maybe you'd like to plug it on our show.
I'd let him do that.
It's about your filmmaking process.
Just just come on.
We've got some really friendly people.
We're very familiar with your work.
Very familiar.
He like he like agrees.
I have to sign a contract to not only not say the word Star Wars at any point,
but not ask him any questions about the Last Jedi whatsoever.
So we have to find like really clever ways.
But like in your history of filmmaking,
have you ever received criticism that you'd be interested in responding to now?
He's like, no.
Hypothetically, if you were to make a sci-fi fantasy movie in the year 2018,
how much tit milk could a grown man consume from an alien?
Do you think?
Yeah, he would have the answer.
So I bet he was.
He looks like a fucking backpack and lights out.
They'll surely be on board with jackets appearing a whole scene later.
God damn it.
And that's just one scene.
You're going to have some sort of problem to solve in every scene.
But that's kind of the fun of it.
And when you come up with a solution that actually make things better,
it's awesome.
But working with movies has kind of ruined video essays.
And here we go.
This is the end point.
And this is kind of.
Film analysis.
You're going to point the finger directly at you.
Well, which let's let's see who he's going to be kind of pointing the finger at.
I wonder if he'll be people like us or another subset.
Who knows?
Let's see me because you just never know if something was part of a brilliant plan
or if it just happened to turn out that way because a problem had to be solved on the day.
We still figured it out.
Now still your plan that you came up with.
He's talking about something specific and then we can eat it all up.
Day in Shazam.
Darla has a clearly defined arc early on.
We see her being the slowest of the foster kids,
which is of course the setup to the payoff of her getting super speed powers later on.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yes.
That's kind of funny.
So the idea that video essays kind of have the problem of reaching so far into meaning
that they can pull stuff that never existed in the first place.
But yeah, as much as I agree, that's definitely possible.
The problem is you can accidentally make a meaningful story.
Like, you know, the idea that they're like, she was sloping on his shoes.
So that means it's like, that's not enough.
The idea that she was sloping on it.
Like, come on, how is that some kind of?
That's not really true to the character either,
because there are a few occasions throughout the film
where she's actually way more intelligent and quick-witted than the other kids.
Doesn't necessarily match.
Yeah.
But then, so for example, like, I don't know,
if you have like all of these details that match your characters are perfectly
and then the director says like, I don't know,
nine out of 10 of those were complete accidents.
Like, does that make it so that they're not meaningful anymore?
Yeah, they're still good.
They still are.
Is that realistic, though?
Like, do you not ever do anything that's out of character?
We're just talking about the theoretical,
because like, this is why if you're trying to construct a rule of
whatever the filmmaker intended is what we can draw meaning from,
I'd be like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
There are so many times where you could make something good accidentally.
And I think that's what his point was to a degree, though.
And the vice versa can happen.
They can intend something to be one way and it turns out really awfully.
And then they're like, but this is what I intended.
So the bad thing is doesn't matter.
Like, yeah, it depends on the setup, doesn't it?
In writing, they you either have a Chekhov's gun or the buried gun.
And the buried gun is sometimes writers, when they write themselves into a corner,
they go, shit, I'm going to go back to my works.
I'm going to see if I've if there's something I can use from the previous chapters
that I can use to get me out of this situation.
And they call it a buried gun because it's like a gun.
Someone's buried in the backyard.
And for some reason, you've forgotten about it.
And then you go, oh, they can pull this gun out in a very metaphoric sense.
But it can create this thing where writers they're trying to look for a buried gun
and they're and they're scrounging and scrounging.
And all they can find is dog turds.
And that's what we're happening with.
That's what's happening with some, let's say, Game of Thrones, season eight,
where they had a couple of those buried gun moments and they just pulled up a turd.
There has to you have to really think about it and set something up.
In literature and plays and films, you have Chekhov's gun, which is if someone puts a gun
on the mantelpiece, sure enough, they're probably going to use that later.
And you've established that you've set it up relatively well or let the audience ignore it there.
I think a girl tying her shoes is too.
It's quite it's not curious.
Yeah, I'll give you an example.
There's a lot of throughout Civil War, like Captain America Civil War.
There's there's loads of there's a running motif of standing up or standing for or standing against.
There's like someone made a big compilation of all the times
actors stand for something or stand against uncertain odds of losing a thing.
And one of the examples was Bucky saying, can you move your seat up to Falcon?
And he's like, no, they're like, he took a stand against Bucky.
And it's like, OK, that was just a joke.
The idea that the director would be like, uh, yeah, yeah, it's the running motif.
Yeah, sure.
And I think this is a problem with a lot of essay writers,
some of them who subscribe to a lot of postmodernism and death of the author.
And a lot of them like to do this reaching.
And and I think it boils down to this kind of intellectual snobbery.
Are you you didn't notice this?
You must not be as as red as I am.
No, no, you need to pay attention to me because I'm the pseudo-intellectual here.
No, not pseudo-intellectual, actually intellectual.
Yeah, not not not every director is David Lynch.
Like everything isn't symbolic and representative.
It's not one massive spider's web of motifs and iconography.
Like sometimes people just write whatever they think feels right at the time.
Like sometimes the doll was just read.
It didn't mean it was a blood door, a vagina door.
It's just a red door.
No, it's a vagina door because vaginas are like doors.
Yes.
That open for my penis.
But the amount of reaching they do, and especially things like symbolism.
And again, it comes into that subjectivity and their feelings matters.
And they do a lot of reaching.
It's, oh, this character is focused in a golden light.
Well, that must mean they're a lesbian.
And you go, what the fuck?
How did you get to that conclusion?
Which is why, yeah, when they get to that degree, I'm usually like,
okay, that's like a subjective interpretation of a theme.
They go, there's no such thing as an objective interpretation.
It's like, there are totally references that are grounded,
especially some of the worst ones are when characters openly just say the thing.
So it's like, what is the point of The Last Jedi as a whole?
What is its theme?
It's like, well, it's that failure can make the greatest teacher.
You're like, how do you know that?
It's like, you ought to set it.
Instead of being able to pick out all the parts of the stories,
the match, you just go, yeah, the character said it.
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
And with that example of the golden light,
from someone who from a more technical standpoint,
from maybe a more objective standpoint, they might go,
well, actually, the way this is filmed, it follows the golden ratio rule.
And that's a rule we use for making things look aesthetically pleasing.
And that's something that's instilled in kind of filmmaking
and something that is part of having objective standards.
But again, I think this podcast will increase by an extra 12 hours
if we go into objectivity and subjectivity.
But that's my two cents on it.
I just thought it was an interesting video.
And I just like that he kind of takes a shot
at interpretive video essays there.
Like, yeah, you guys kind of just make shit up.
But yeah, okay.
It's all intended.
No, no, I completely agree.
It's rife.
A lot of, I think a lot of essayists like the idea of being thought of as an essayist.
There's a lot of, again, pseudo-intellectualism tied to it and snobbery.
And yeah, they sound a lot of clout to it.
Look what I do.
I'm smart.
This video.
Yeah, I'm a deep thinking essayist.
And it's like, you make it sound like you're this professor in a lecture hall.
You're a guy in your parents' basement with an editing software.
And you've just happened to read a few books by other postmodernist wankers
whose only credentials are, well, I feel things and I talk smart.
So, of course, the professor is advocating for paying attention to professors beyond anyone else.
Exactly.
Professor of what, Tosspot?
This podcast isn't about me.
So what's next topic?
All right.
The next one is, and this is a video a couple people sent me once Wisecrack put it out.
Do any of you guys know Wisecrack, the channel?
Yeah, I'm aware of it.
I want to say I've heard of it.
They are there.
I think they consider themselves a philosophy channel to a degree.
They look into media and try and explain what the character such the content is trying to.
I think they the guys they have like a series.
It's like some alien guy who does assessments of movies as if they're like ancient relics from.
I think he joined Wisecrack.
Actually, he wasn't a part of them at first.
I've seen I've seen a few things by them.
I'm not a massive fan or anything.
An alien joined.
But you are a massive.
You're talking to a pizza and you're confused about an alien joining a YouTube channel.
I'm so fucking high.
So they made a video that a couple people, like I said,
sent me because they were like, what is all this about that?
I watched a bit of it and I was like, hmm, this should make for a good vehicle for discussion.
It's titled why Avengers Endgame did what Game of Thrones couldn't.
Be good ish.
Yeah, essentially have a good ending.
And I'm just like already I'm on the defensive.
Like, I don't know the Game of Thrones couldn't.
This is mostly about preparation, then, I guess, because
Endgame managed to sort of capitalize on all of the points that were set up previously.
And that was the whole point.
Whereas I think Game of Thrones failed in some instances.
But that doesn't mean they couldn't have done it.
Well, because of how vague the title is, you're going to want to click it, right?
And then you're going to see what their argument is.
So let's see.
Damn, click bait.
What their argument is.
This video is brought to you by Wix.
Check out Wix.
Ah, brought to you by Wix.
Now, let's let's explore that.
What's up, Wix?
What's up, guys?
Jared here with another Wisecrack vlog.
It's been on your head this summer.
Feel like his hair was there.
Moana crack vlog.
It's been quite the summer.
The 22 film long Avengers Infinity Saga ended along with the 73.
Hold on, did that axe just touch Carol's hair?
Yeah, it like flowed past her, I guess.
Is that counterstatching?
Well, I'm pretty sure that's more than a matter of battery.
Or we'll be going to jail once she finds him.
I think that's her goal.
With the 73 episode long Game of Thrones.
And as I'm sure you know, the two endings received widely different reactions.
Now, we've already dissected the narrative and structural elements of these two conclusions.
So don't worry.
I'm not here to beat that dead horse.
But I am here to hopefully rethink the problem altogether.
What?
We think the data was actually a dead donkey.
So he said, what if ending Game of Thrones in a satisfying way was impossible?
That's what he said.
For everyone, then yeah, but in general,
satisfy most audience members, I'd say it was almost easy.
Yeah, even if you just gave them what they want and a lot of people,
what they wanted, sounds like it would make sense.
And honestly, I think endgame is proof that it was almost easy because the writing in endgame
is pre-tismy, but they had all of the payoffs people want to see.
Like Iron Man saving everybody by dying, cap, fucking wielding the old year.
It's just like, oof, everybody would like a giant wall with every hero.
Yes, Spider-Man and Iron Man's reunion.
And it's not very deep, it's just when everyone wanted,
even though it makes sense, sort of, in this area.
Although I would say that final battle scene was a little bit underwhelming for me personally.
I would have liked some more set pieces and some cool character combinations.
I wanted it to last longer.
Yeah, oh, definitely.
More killing.
Actually, come to think of it, has the Blu-ray come out yet?
Give it, I think, a half month?
Is there an extended cut?
It's probably some deleted scenes of, like, piss-poor CGI that we could see.
I've seen a scene of everyone taking a knee that was taken out of the movie,
which I thought it was quite a poignant moment and it was a shame that it wasn't in the film.
But yeah, I'd like to see more of it, basically, because I feel like this,
yeah, that's been about six hours long.
What's the easy way to end Game of Thrones?
Like, what are people typically looking for?
It's like probably Jon on the throne seriously gets killed by either Jamie or Arya,
or Arya wearing Jamie's face.
Night King is killed by Jon at the end, probably.
Daenerys, you could probably have a loser mind over the course of losing everything,
and then she makes some decisions.
You know, there's just tweaks all over the place.
Lots of possibilities is the point, isn't it?
Yeah, I was trying to go with the most rote expected ending,
but like, you know, you can make an amazing ending if you worked really hard on it.
Even just with one season, you could do it.
But anyway, let's hear why it's not possible.
Thrones in a satisfying way was actually impossible.
What if the reason we love the show is the same reason it could never gracefully end?
To figure that out, we have to understand how narrative works,
why it's changing, and possibly discover how video games caused this whole mess.
What?
You know, that's what I mean, you hear him say that, you're like,
what?
Why do you need to?
Okay, the movies, the movies, the uh, you what?
Why did you need to go into these topics?
But okay, I need more information because this doesn't compute right now.
Fucking Mario's fault that Game of Thrones is bad.
Welcome to this Wisecrack vlog on finales.
And obviously, it didn't just die.
By Mario.
Fucking Mario.
Write that down.
God damn.
See, that just sounds like parody, doesn't it?
Like if I said that, I mean, it will be parody once I make the April Fool's video.
But the idea that you're like, in order to explain what Game of Thrones couldn't
possibly have ended in a satisfying way, we need to go back to Super Mario.
It's such a non sequitur, isn't it?
How do you get from that?
It's just like, you could, you could throw any old shit out there.
Just like, has Miley Cyrus's twerking caused the reboot error?
I personally think it's because of George Foreman grills.
But we'll see.
Let's, let's see how this will play out.
There might be a principle you can draw from it.
I just wonder if whatever he draws from Mario is something you could have drawn
from like anything that's much closer to Game of Thrones instead of Mario, but we'll find out.
But that's the beauty of this post-modernism shit, isn't it?
You can draw any old conclusion out.
Well, you have control in a video game.
You can determine your own story.
They're born.
Game of Thrones would never.
That sounds plausible.
That sounds plausible.
Yeah, but that's what I mean.
That's the only rationale I can muster right now.
Yeah, and then you just punch it up with some big words.
Yeah, you punch it up with big words.
And yeah.
But that means that by that reasoning, nothing will ever be good ever again because video games exist.
Yep.
So what the fuck?
Thanks, Nintendo.
Yeah.
Nice one, me and my own.
Loop boxes ruined Avengers.
They're called surprise mechanics.
Surprise mechanics?
Surprise mechanics.
I'm trying to think of like, what would be the most bizarre things to say?
Like, if you had like a reverse, you're like, in order to understand why Avengers Endgame was
successful, we need to discuss and you have like Dexter's laboratory, a bagel, and then like
shipping, shipping manifestos.
Let's try this.
Let's try this.
Let's see if we can actually come up with some pseudo-intellectual post-monet bollocks.
Okay, so give us those three items that you just said.
What were the three?
Oh, so Dexter's laboratory, a bagel, and shipping manifestos.
And we have to relate these to.
No, Avengers Endgame.
Okay.
Well, Dexter's laboratory, the actual lab itself, is really symbolic of Dexter's
internalized attempt for dominance that he can't exude in the outward world
because of his physical stature.
He's a short boy.
Which to a degree, that's how Banner felt about Hulk.
Hulk was a much larger than life character that he could never be.
So he placed himself within Hulk together.
Dexter and his lab, Hulk and Banner.
Yeah, keep going.
Just pump it up with some more.
All right, your turn.
Relate bagel to Endgame.
Bagels are extremely circular.
They have a hole in the middle.
And a lot of the times when we're trying to run away from our problems and our issues,
our fate brings us right back around to where we begin, much like the circle of a bagel.
And what we learned is what we needed to take the dive.
We need to jump into the center.
That was where we all instead of running around our problems, we need to take them head on,
jump through the bagel.
You see, because the bagel revolves around the middle, which is nothing.
And once you use that bagel, that bagel will become nothing.
Exactly.
So now all we have is shipping manifestos.
Shipping manifestos.
Okay.
The shipping manifesto is well ordered and it's structured, much like our own interpretations
of what our life should be.
But as we know, be it through storms or pirates or mechanical failures, all kinds of problems
can happen in our lives.
And that shipping manifesto becomes nothing more than a wish and a hope of what we wanted
our life's journey to be.
The shipping manifesto is almost like inverting our expectations.
Because sometimes when it comes to shipping, you don't always get what you want.
Sometimes there's something smuggled in there.
And with end games, there were deeper themes and meaning smuggled amongst the action and
things like that.
There's so many themes we can draw upon, like post-colonialism as well.
There are certainly post-colonialist themes in end games, you know, Thanos coming to our
planet hoping to colonize it or take it away, take resource away, just like colonists took
away from minorities and things like that.
There are some very deep themes in end game.
And the bit where Hulk dabs, well, that was a critical critique of modern American culture.
And they bring it back to the bagel as well.
The bagel symbolizes popular American culture.
And within that, we can draw that when we consume bagels, we are consuming American culture.
And that's Marvel movies are essentially the bagel of the cinematic world.
We love to consume bagels.
We cannot get enough of them just like we can't get enough of Marvel films and the consuming
of superhero pop culture.
But we ultimately find it very fulfilling.
Please subscribe to my Patreon, send me more money for soy milk.
There you go.
See how fucking easy it is.
If Marvel is a bagel, then what's DC in the in the bagel?
It's a bagel, but it's moldy.
It's a moldy bagel.
I mean, this is just purely good material here.
All you need is a pretentious title.
The lesson we didn't learn from Avengers Endgame.
That could be your title.
Just make people go, oh, what was the last we did?
They're just bagels, obviously.
So easy.
As long as you stand authoritative and you you've more or you can do the essayist voice,
can't you?
That's kind of very deep.
This is all I've been making.
No, this is all going to get down three.
But it's almost like you could you could program this kind of shit into a computer
and it would just go beep beep beep and then just shit out this perfectly
pale middle class soy boy with thick rim glasses and you give him the latest post-modernist text
and you go go go make something to do with popular culture because that'll get your views
and and throw in some lofty post-modernism ideas.
There you go.
That's that's instant money because other people as well like to whack off to it intellectually.
Yeah, I watch these essays.
I watch these essays.
I feel quite learned after watching these.
Yes, I you've been watching movies wrong.
Yeah, that's what you've been watching.
I feel like you're quoting someone there.
Anyway, Wisecrack vlog on finales and obviously spoilers ahead for endgame and Game of Thrones.
But before we get to it, I want to give a shout out to our sponsors over at Wix.
Everything is online nowadays and we skip the ad read.
We're actually, um, this is funny.
So the second Wisecrack video we've got is something that's more of a goof.
Like I just want to show you how bad some of their ads get.
It's just funny because we're trying to deal with a normal video and it's like stop with the ads.
You definitely want the first search result to come up with something positive.
With Wix's advanced SEO optimization, your site will be the first thing that comes up in the search
and allow you to put your best foot forward in every situation.
In our previous Avengers video, we asked you to send us your Wix site.
And again, you guys sent us some amazing stuff.
Today, I want to feature the work of Justin.
Oh yeah, I'm sure they did.
This is probably all in the contract as well as like,
you need to talk about it for at least one minute or whatever.
Personalized piano lesson.
I mean, it wouldn't be so bad if not the fact that this is already a 10th of the video.
And her site is complete with
Terry wanted me to do the thing.
They're like 10, 15 seconds.
I'm like, really?
Yeah, it's 10, 15 seconds.
Oh, look at this shit, guys.
JCROX77.wixsite.com slash piano dash theory dash Justine spelled with a double E.
He's like, Jesus, that's nice and simple.
Yeah, that's right.
Nice and easy.
And more.
Why the hell does it begin with that?
JCROX77.
Like Justine, I've also made a personalized website using Wix to promote my site.
Come for the piano lessons, stay for the malware.
Oh, wow.
So he said he's made this himself.
This is his thing on it.
And it says my voice is like butter.
It's humble.
So it's bad for you.
All right.
Hustle voiceover artist.
You can use any of their beautiful predesigned.
Are you a butter pizza?
Is that actually cheese or is it butter?
Or is it something else?
It's multiple different kinds of cheese.
There's mozzarella cheddar and red luster.
Red luster.
I've never even heard of that.
I'm British, so.
Okay.
That means that whatever he says you would have heard of, right?
The mozzarella portion kind of gives it the elasticity that you'd expect
when you lift a slice of pizza from the whole pizza and you get that kind of stringy.
Elastic stretch.
But then the the cheddar is very, very strong cheesy flavor.
And then red luster is a bit more full bodied.
So do you have any American cheese in there?
No, that just that just gives you heart attack.
Yeah.
Moza's voice is like vegetable.
Yay.
Start from scratch.
They've got all sorts of features.
You can put a store on there, run polls or feature YouTube videos like Justine.
So don't miss out on any professional opportunities by ensuring that you've
got a great looking site that they forgot to mention that you can put a store on your site,
but you can only add one item to that store or anything more than that.
And they take a huge commission on every sale.
Oh, shit.
They don't tell you that in the ad.
It's like 25, 30 percent something ridiculous.
Oh, man.
And you have to also pay to host additional items regardless of whether you sell them or not.
It's a it's a rip.
Oh, my gosh.
That's awful.
Like Teespring and other places, they're just like, yeah, we take care of all of it.
Get half or whatever percent of all the sales, but we take care of everything.
And if it's if it sells, it's fine.
Yeah, they don't actually tell you that until the very end.
Like I've used Wix and I use their builder to make a site.
And then when it came to the e-commerce section, you have to like tick
loads of boxes and it shows you all the rates and stuff.
And I was like, well, no.
So I like never finished making the site.
I would never recommend this to people.
Yeah, but he was paid for it.
Oh, I would have integrity.
That's the difference.
Your next internship or job could come from traffic to your site.
So create your own website for free.
I was going to say go Squarespace.
This is what everyone else recommends, right?
Yeah, Squarespace is good.
Flashwisecrack or click here to get started.
And now back to the show.
Back to the show.
Let's find out.
Mario connects to what?
First, we should note that now back to the intro to my video.
Fucking two minutes in.
Now, back to the show.
First, we should note that we're talking about the difference between
movies and serialized TV.
That is TV.
Yeah.
Aloha Akbar.
I mean, there's an argument to be made.
The fucking MCU is like a TV show at this point.
Oh yeah, it's a serialized movie.
It's just the first of its kind.
So people don't treat it that way.
Yeah.
For all we know fast forward like four years and we could be dealing with a lot
of those simultaneously running.
Yeah, I'm not against that at all.
No, I'm not either.
So I feel like that could be cool with end game specifically.
I think if you were to not see any other Marvel movie and just go and see end game,
you'd spend 90% of the time being like, uh, what's going on?
Like, who are these?
Who's that?
What's what?
Because it's not, it's not its own thing.
That is TV with long overarching plots,
a la Game of Thrones, Dexter, Sopranos, et cetera.
By contrast in a movie traditionally,
a conflict must be presented that resolves by the.
Yeah, there's a lot.
I don't know.
Okay, wait.
So there are, there are overarching plots in the MCU.
Obviously they're, they're quite thin.
You know, like Thanos is obviously thin up until infinity war.
But some of them, um, like civil wars, big conflict is just brewing throughout
the other films.
And then if you were to be like, see Game of Thrones, you know,
they don't solve problems within episodes or whatever.
It's like, Oh no, there's like loads of smaller stories, mid stories,
and then big stories.
You know, the ones that are lasting a lot longer.
And like to a degree, the Robert Baratheon story ends, you know,
starts and ends in season one.
Hmm.
Um, the story of how the kingdoms go from peace to carnage is all in season one.
Uh, I don't know if, what would you compare a movie to a season or a couple of episodes?
I don't know.
Or like a mini series, maybe like a short mini series.
You get 90.
Well, I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know in terms of duration, but just kind of story covered and plot points resolved.
Brandos, et cetera, by contrast in a movie.
Traditionally, a conflict must be presented that resolves by the end.
Now this understanding gets tricky, not only because of art films that push boundaries,
but also more mainstream cliffhanger films.
Well, the hungry games, mocking Jay par one or Harry Potter or the MCU to a degree.
I was going to say, I was going to say kill bill.
Yeah.
Like the whole point of kill bill is that the bride needs to kill bill and she doesn't do it.
The conflict is not.
Yeah.
In the deathly Hallows part one, but for the most part,
cinema has largely been characterized by a conflict that prompts some kind of meaningful
transformation. Even the interconnected infinity saga films save for infinity war
have central conflicts that resolve within their.
How do you highlight civil war when that film's conflict was not resolved at all?
They don't talk to each other after civil war.
Yeah.
And the only reason that there was a conflict in the civil war was because of other movies
that set up that conflict.
So not only did it not get resolved in that movie, it didn't get made in that movie either.
The conflict is a result of conflict in other previous.
Does he just mean.
Super Mario.
It was all because he's going to get to that.
Yeah.
Of course.
Does he just mean the fighting ended?
Is that what he's referring to?
It's like the fight stopped by the scene has eventually credits rolls.
Yeah.
The credits did roll.
No more conflict.
We beat it.
We did it.
For infinity war have central conflicts that resolve within their particular installment.
Tony Stark has to stop stain and the violent cycle of arms dealing.
The chala needs to bring Wakanda out of their isolation and defeat radicalism.
And Dr. Strange needs to embrace.
Yeah, but wait.
He's sort of highlighting what I was talking about.
So the chala's story in Wakanda is like, that's not over.
It's an open-ended thing.
He's like, we're about to give Earth access to Wakandan help.
We're going to say like, hey, by the way, we're the most technologically advanced
people on this planet.
We're going to help you.
It's like, whoa, what's going to happen next?
Dr. Strange is like, yeah, we stopped the world from ending.
Now we're going to rebuild it.
And yeah, you know what I mean?
Like the idea that it's like, oh, the conflict is end.
It's like, yeah, but this is no different than Game of Thrones.
You have episode long conflicts.
You have a couple of episode long conflicts and you have season long conflicts and then series
long conflicts.
Can you say the same for the MCU?
Movie long conflicts, several movie long conflicts, and then franchise long?
I think you can.
I guess it depends how you analyze them, because I feel like this guy's treating it
as the individual antagonist.
So obviously you've got like Ultron.
It's like, oh yeah, well, he's gone now.
So that's the end of that conflict.
It's like, well, no, because that's not the entire story.
And I would argue that the residue of Ultron's existence is in civil war.
He's like, he's a huge reason why civil war happens.
But also they're open ended with the infinity stone as every single one of them.
That too.
So in some ways, they're self contained stories, but they also have these little.
Like Loki threads leading into something bigger, a bit like a TV series.
Loki is the phase one villain.
Phase two villain is Ultron, I guess.
And then phase three is Thanos.
And you know, Loki's story begins in Thor.
Like, I don't know, I don't agree with this premise.
Challa needs to bring Wakanda out of their isolation and defeat.
I agree that conflicts are resolved in these films to a degree.
But like, I would say that that applies to the episodes of Game of Thrones, too.
Radicalism.
And Doctor Strange needs to embrace the mystical in order to stop Cassilius and Dormammu.
Their goals reach completion.
Unlike in Game of Thrones, where, for example,
Daenerys's goal to become the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.
Okay.
Wait, wait, wait, no, no.
No, that's the whole point of the entire series.
That's not just her.
Yeah, right.
So the idea that Daenerys's story begins and ends with getting the throne is pretty nonsensical.
She goes through a shit ton of other mini stories like getting into Kaathe.
That's solved in the same episode.
It's it arrives getting help from Kaathe.
That's solved over the season because she eventually just plunders Kaathe.
Season two was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was season and season three had the slavers where she's freeing the slave.
Yeah.
Like she's got loads of shit to do.
Yeah.
The comparison also for a city for a bit, doesn't she?
The comparison with me going, you see in Iron Man one,
Iron Man is like, I want to protect the world from evil weapons.
And he doesn't do that until Endgame.
That's pretty bullshit.
Oh, no, he still hasn't done that even still now.
No, he's dead now.
So we failed.
God damn.
Yeah, I don't.
I disagree with the framing.
Balls reach completion, unlike in Game of Thrones, where, for example,
Daenerys's goal to become the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms is introduced in episode seven.
I wonder how big that man's dick is.
Leviathan.
It's probably fucking massive.
Hey, stop making fun of this.
It's some kind of racism.
My smile.
It doesn't get resolved until many, many episodes.
Yeah, because that's like the fucking series arc for her.
There's a couple of those.
The story of the whole story.
The White Walkers is episode one through to season eight, episode three,
because the show is stupid.
Don't worry, they resolved it really well.
Even though you have the hard home drama, which starts and ends in the episode hard home.
You know what I mean?
And you're like, oh, well, that's not the end of the White Walkers.
It's like, no, it's not.
But it's not the end of Loki, the end of Thor,
but that's still the end of the conflict in Thor.
This is dumb.
I don't.
Yeah, this is really minimum.
Something needs to happen in a movie.
Michael, something needs to happen.
No, disagree.
Movies should be about things happening.
Not it's a movie.
So something has to happen.
You could have a movie with two people have an interesting conversation.
I don't know.
Like conversation is something happening.
Oh, shit.
Well, then nothing happening would basically be black screen with no image.
A malfunction is something happening, right?
All right.
Yeah, I guess we're fucked.
He's right.
He's right.
It's not a malfunction if it's what you intended.
Well, it's still something happening.
It's always how do you have reality about something happening, though?
Is being is being doing?
I guess to an extent there's a bunch of processes occurring inside our bodies, right?
So things are happening.
Is existing a thing happening?
I'd have to ask this man.
Like a frozen moment in time.
Am I being a doggo?
No time passes.
Yes.
Oh, God, we killed him.
Oh, no.
At a minimum, something needs to happen in a movie.
Michael needs to become the godfather.
Batman needs to defeat the Joker.
And Andy Dufresne needs to find freedom.
And for a while, the same standard was largely leveled at television.
Larry, Curly, and Mo need to cause a mess.
Ricky or Lucy need to learn a lesson.
And the crew of the Enterprise has to extricate the week.
For most of film and TV history, it's been generally agreed
that stories need a beginning, middle, and end.
But wait, since when was how has this changed, though?
Yeah, I think it's just going.
I think it's just tying into his Mario video game.
Well, what I'm I'm confused.
I was in a friend that right.
But you know, like beginning middle and the way I look at the MCU is it goes
beginning middle and beginning middle and beginning like for a whole line,
but then underneath that, the layer below it is beginning middle.
And then underneath that, there's an even bigger one.
You know, like this seems to be what they're doing.
But that's Game of Thrones as well.
Same thing.
You know, he's he's like he's lining him up for how they're different.
But I'm just like, no, they're kind of the same, actually.
You kind of convinced me.
But some would say that something has changed.
We're now obsessed with the middle.
Huh?
All right.
Just only because there's a longer amount of time between the beginning and the end.
There's more middle than anything else.
We're not we're not obsessed with it.
It's just essential.
I'm not sure that he's counting it correctly as well,
because does he consider everything between Iron Man one and end game the middle?
Or does or does it not count?
Or is it episode one of Game of Thrones?
An episode last episode is the middle as well.
Like I'm curious how.
Hmm.
Writer Richard J. Allen claims that technology is eroding our old as Aristotle storytelling.
Okay.
All right.
And hang on.
Who is this person?
I don't know.
This is Aristotle.
No, Richard J.
Something is writing about Aristotle.
We're just going to keep our characters in place.
I want to I want to I want to know who this fucker is.
This is part of the Greek philosophy cinematic universe.
You have to watch.
You have to watch the technology is eroding Richard J.
Allen Aristotle.
It's we can keep track.
Wasn't it wasn't a Renz reviews who said like it's ridiculous that we have to remember multiple names.
How could they expect us to read Richard J.
Allen and Aristotle God.
Stottle storytelling models.
O.G. text on literary theory poetics basically boils down to suggesting that playwrights stick
to one subject and focus on a shift that takes place in a character from bad to good fortune
or from good to bad.
This structure is based on the idea of catharsis that our emotions get purified or purged when
these conflicts find their resolution.
Now Aristotle originally attributed this phenomenon to a feeling we get when watching
tragedies but it's been used as a framework to understand dramatic structure writ large.
This is the feeling we get when after defeating his father Quill says his final goodbye to Yondu.
The easy way to put it is just that everything you saw was came to a point.
So I mean it's like some tragic happened something really great happened whatever everyone
understands what catharsis I hope the opposite is when you have all of these things happen
and then it just ends and you're like oh all right that was fun.
It's having that resolution isn't it.
Yeah it's fine emotional satisfaction yeah kind of in a way.
Sets aside his selfishness and flies the nuke into the wormhole.
The mode in which these plays were consumed.
I love that framing sets aside his selfishness like
setting aside your selfishness at that moment is your your want to not die.
Set aside your selfishness and pieces of shit kill yourself okay.
Soon played an important role in the creation of Aristotle's model.
As Alan notes the environment in which Aristotle and his peers experienced theatrical productions
was daunting.
They were in outdoor arenas that seated 14 to 17,000 spectators who were eating drinking
and often yelling at the actors.
That still happens today.
Yeah it encourages you to make a good story and not fuck up.
The seats were angry greeks will be shitting down your throat
would or the audience sat on the ground.
Oh man imagine sitting on a stone here.
Awkward and pillows up in there.
Downed in short it was not the most comfortable setting for taking in a man.
There are people at the top.
I feel like we're going into the amphitheater sir.
What was that?
Does that go out?
Tosspot are you okay?
No.
He's dead.
He's finally dead.
I thought I heard someone shouting it over the back.
This is the end of Tosspot's story.
I'm sure I heard someone shouting like shut the fuck up in the background.
See this is an example of how it would be Paul Catharsis that he's had this YouTube
channel for ages.
He's done those great guests.
He's on a podcast and they just suddenly randomly disappears.
Forever.
What happened to you?
Was it drugs?
No.
Well oh god it was no drugs.
He was no drugs.
A lack of drugs.
You haven't missed much.
He's talking about amphitheaters.
Yeah again this is another tenuous thing.
He needs it to explain it.
Well an Aristotle made Super Mario Bros.
And.
Listen Richard J.
Richard J.
You have to understand.
You don't understand okay.
He's explaining it.
As such one can understand why Aristotle would prefer all of this and ends.
If you're going to put on your sweaty toe gun,
slap your ass over to the arena for some entertainment.
Something better happen.
When is there a scenario where you wouldn't want something to happen.
Yeah.
Hashtag relatable.
I love how he's like you know they were in tough times having to go and watch these
things so they definitely want something to happen.
It's like since when would you ever sacrifice your time for no reason?
You know if I go to a movie theater and it's a shitty movie I don't feel very good.
I had to I had to put on my well I don't wear clothes but I had to get someone to
drive me out there to the movie theater.
Sneak in and like watch a movie spend money.
Do they not do dog tickets?
Oh they do.
Where you live okay.
I love that though.
Explaining to us like back then they wanted their stories to have a point.
It's like yeah.
Like fuck you for making assumptions of what the people of fucking ancient
Greece wanted and didn't want.
You don't fucking know.
Yeah what if they just but there's a social gathering and the play was just going back and on.
The theater of 14,000 people who were shouting and eating and drinking.
Yeah they ironically didn't care.
They just went there to hang out with friends.
They were just like oh fuck the story is.
It was just the meeting place like as if they didn't have microphones and a sound system and
a PA.
How are you gonna fucking hear the play?
If there's 14,000 other screaming men and maybe women.
I don't know if there was women surrounding you.
They have that they had women.
Oh there were women in the Greek terms.
There were.
I thought they invented them in like the 1900s.
Oh well it was it was a special kind of gay where you could be gay but also still have a lady.
I am.
Yeah that sounds good.
We need to go back.
I don't know my opinion in my opinion.
Happened.
They're better.
Is that a sword under your toe?
Imagine if I asked one of those crotchety Athenians to truck his ass.
Hold on this this works on the idea that the theater was the only form of storytelling.
What about actually just telling stories?
Like not everyone was privileged enough to go to the amphitheater.
Yeah and as we just grow up.
Medium of telling stories.
As we just brought up there's probably multiple reasons they would go to it.
I think he's about to make the point that somebody from ancient Greece would be disappointed
with Dragon Ball Z if it didn't get a certain plot point.
Which is absolutely fucking outrageous to say.
If you were to show an anime to someone from ancient Greece they would fucking lose their mind.
They would be in awe.
They'd start a new religion.
Yes.
Something better happen.
There better be a takeaway.
Imagine if I asked one of those crotchety Athenians to truck his ass out there for
one of those Dragon Ball Z episodes where Goku screams for 22 minutes and nothing happens.
I think he would consider that something happening.
He'd be like holy shit.
This guy like exploding.
Look at all the colors.
No honestly I think I would concede he'd be interested.
He would be staring at the screen like this is insane.
He never seen anything like that before.
Pissed.
Fast forward to the golden age of cinema and you can imagine something similar.
People used to wear their best attire when going to the movies.
Or in the days of early television the audience only had a single.
Society in general is more casual publicly now.
Yeah.
Like that's just a general trend that's been happening for a while.
Like no it's just because of cinema.
Oh okay.
Glad we this is an educational program so I appreciate.
I don't know where to close outside.
I know.
Losers do.
That's true and no loser am I.
In television the audience only had a single opportunity to watch the episode.
So you had to sit there and watch the whole thing.
It was.
No you could record it.
I don't know I guess he's talking about like really early TV.
A contained event and people expected the content to be similarly contained.
But these days the entertainment landscape looks radically different.
Alan notes that with digital video social media and smartphones.
Thanks for the visual cues there I wouldn't have understood what you were talking about.
And ironically editing like that I assume they do it just to make people go.
Ooh ooh ooh.
And again he keeps creating this Alan guy who from what I can see is just
someone who's worked in theater.
Excuse me.
His name is Richard L. Alan.
He's just greedy.
He wants like no I don't want one name.
I want two names.
But I'm thinking this again.
Homo person they can all they sound authoritative.
This sounds very intellectual.
Fuck it.
This gives us credence.
It's the appeal to authority that they're doing.
And it's I'm sure that is he going to mention any of the critics that actually dispute this.
Because otherwise there is this clear bias.
That's what I want to know.
And how the fuck does this fit into Super Mario.
I think I think we get this hopefully.
I don't know.
Video social media and smartphones.
We can now consume entertainment anywhere anytime.
Thus as he puts it being an audience member is no longer.
Um did people were people stuck in the amphitheater and they couldn't leave.
I'm confused by this.
Well being an audience member is no longer a temporary state.
Well it is.
I'm not watching a Marvel movie right now.
Okay let me finish this ongoing lifelong viewing experience.
Okay no that's not true at all.
What does he mean?
I have no idea why you put a pen to paper on that and decided it still was a keeper.
So viewing the viewing experience is the default life log and what we're doing right now.
Just a pause.
What?
By that logic everything we do is lifelong with just pauses.
I've heard this argument film professor.
I'll be talking about this like actually every time we blink.
That's like a cut in editing that like our life is a it's.
I bet he is a postmodernist.
He was the biggest promo ever.
So when a baby.
When a baby is literally born is it already a viewer or does it only.
Yes he started on pause.
He started on pause.
So that's not the default state.
He was already a viewer but he's always from the first second of his life.
This is such a pseudo intellectual like I need someone pondering and going like.
We never really stop consuming content we merely pause.
Like okay.
Well that means everybody in the chat is actually just a lifelong.
And whenever whenever you're not streaming they're just it's just on pause.
Or I'm right in my really pretentious lines here.
But what if what if you're the person making the stuff for the audience.
Then you no longer audience are you free from the.
Almost yeah that's the way to find an audience member I can't just.
I like the idea that this this video freaked people out they're like oh god we're going to
stop watching stuff we're stuck I'll do anything stuck how long couldn't this apply to the Greeks
though couldn't you just be like oh every time they left the amphitheater they were on pause.
They're there you're only living when you're at the amphitheater which
is oddly enough a poster that they would distribute to get people to show up at the amphitheater.
Because of the plethora of options that enable you to experience a story at
any time Alan argues that we are less conditioned to expect a definitive
transformation or predictable conclusion we still get them though.
There are many stories that don't okay so Game of Thrones ended
his argument only works if you went on forever.
Yeah in our hearts I mean I wish it didn't.
But his whole argument is Alan says Alan says this Alan says this.
And my friend Alan says that we are all audience members and we can never escape.
Yeah my friend Frank he's a professor too and he says no Alan's full of shit.
That's his book Alan's full of shit.
He says yeah Alan's a dickhead video essay.
Alan's a dickhead.
Game of Thrones has an ending Alan is full of shit.
Or at any time Alan argues that we are less conditioned to expect a definitive
transformation or predictable conclusion.
Oh I keep forgetting that Alan is his name I'm just picturing this guy just called Alan.
You know what it was he was called Alan but then when the publisher was like
you gotta change your name Alan is just not imposing enough he's like what about Richard
he's like that's much better he's like you can keep Alan on the end Richard L.
Alan just to make sure he's great that's the story of Alan.
Alan's attainment in the digital age is a completely new psychological phenomenon.
One he argues appeals to much more primitive human.
Okay okay I'm seeing a bias with Alan he's pissing on digital media and works in theater.
He's basically saying digital age is full of shit you know what you should do you should go
to the theater more.
By the way I've got a play on I'm also writing a book about how digital media is shit.
Please no one's attending my shitty plays come see them otherwise
you're primitive.
If you're involved in the digital age you're you're a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal
and you need to go to the theater because that's more civilized and you'll have a big boy brain
like me.
This is just funny.
Don't laugh to yourself before the deal is suck an Andrew Lloyd Webber's cock and do one you fucker.
Apparently it's Richard J. Alan he's probably got lots of essays.
It's twat.
Richard twat Alan.
Richard J. Twat.
That's what Alan says my friend Alan.
Instincts.
He claims the optimal stories for the new media.
Wait wait wait wait uh Wilf said Richard Lallan.
I don't like wait was his name was his name Lallan and then he was like that's such an ugly
embarrassing name I'll just drop the L make it a middle name and just have Alan.
There's a lot of there's a lot of theories for this is very important there's a whole MCU based after him.
Ecological phenomenon one he argues appeals to much more primitive human instincts.
He claims the optimal stories for the new media function on an extended middle
or an infinite stage of development.
It's just not true.
Just just because the MCU is a long running story doesn't mean it has a lot of stories in between.
Same for Game of Thrones.
We still have a singular movie.
Are you doubting Alan?
And you can't pause a play so you have to have stories quickly.
There's so many like big movies that come out that are finished when they fucking like the idea.
Okay so you know he's explaining it as like the big middle you know how stranger things like
pretty much has an ending but then they're like hey we can make a season two with a little drop
I was like ha ha he's like ha ha so it hasn't ended so we're just watching the middle this whole time
it's like no no season one has a start and end it does they just have an old sequel bait they did
that like for a million years everyone does they do the fucking everything that's not
the idea that we've transferred to the digital age and now need more middle what is that theory
what is that it's like does he know that plays were like separated into acts and different acts
might have different you know little mini plots that happen and characters who arrive
no no none of it no there's no middle it's just I just want to ask him if he actually considers
episode two through episode like 90 whatever of Game of Thrones to be considered the middle
if he does which is insane
wrong wrong
an infinite stage of development now certainly well how could it be an infinite stage of development
if it has an ending it just how can you reference Game Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad when they're
both over he said big words and that's enough fucking Allen Allen poisoned this man
but they love to throw in these word salad that's what it is and I don't think if you actually
simplify and put in layman terms what you actually get is no that's just a really convoluted way of
saying this you just like to huff your own farts I like thoughts but hey Allen Allen said something
cool sounding so he's gospel because my friend Allen he's he's great this video should be this
guy called Allen said this that's what this video is my friend Allen directs theater yeah
here's dragon ball z here's an empty here's a bagel here's a shipping manifesto enjoy
Allen's gonna become like the new meme you would be a villain he's absolutely a defab
villain if any yeah oh old media bastion Allen pictured like this is a grumpy old man with like
old man I imagine you know that simpson's uh episode and there's a clip of grandpa simpson
old man yells at cloud yeah the old man yells at netflix I don't understand you why do people watch
magic screens with the moving pictures everywhere he's like he's like pointing to them witchcraft
how do they fit all those tiny people inside of that little box he's got a room full of notes and
strings and shit and he's like what the fuck everyone's obsessed with the middle it's the middle
the middle is to blame do you think that he can't write middle like he's really good at beginning
and endings but he just can't write middle and he's really jealous literally everything like
hamburgers and hot dogs the middle of the street I would love to see one of his plays if he missed
out the middle it starts with a man coming home from work oh I had a long day at work and then
it ends with his wife just dead and then they kick him out it's like Allen game of thrones ended and
he's like it's just the middle it's not the end it's just the middle they're gonna make more well
I mean yeah there's going to be like spin-off seasons and stuff so technically they're also
the middle you're saying Allen isn't completely full of shit oh no don't say that it's going to
write a second book and there'll be a more pseudo intellectuals gulping up his farts like they're
oxygen our sequels he writes another book does that mean his first book is just also the middle
how sequels turn prequels into the middle Allen died from suicide because he realized the only
way that he could end the cycle is just fucking kill himself I need to have an end I can't just
be the middle I have to have I can't just live my life as a middle man just start it's a suicide
then all the middle from the world he dies he goes to the next plate of existence they're like yeah
you know the idea this is just the middle really oh no this is why he likes bagels because they
don't have any middle oh my god oh my god all making sense take us home Allen kills too much
more primitive human instincts I like the idea that they associate what we watch these days with
primitive instincts like a fucking caveman watching fucking game of thrones like TV programs for
idiot loon morons frog like game of thrones and poor brain sitting in front of my box
you primitives with your netflix
why don't you go to the amphitheater like a civilized
allen you need to you need to calm down stop please nobody wears like fancy clothes to turn
up to plays anymore and it makes him he like looks around the toga please looking around the
cinema everyone's wearing casual clothing while he's in his like full tuxedo like oh
man poor allen dude he sees this essay he's coming like what there's a digital thing talking about
me and my work this these fucking primitive neanderthals are coming for me with their advanced
does this video have an ending
argues appeals to much more primitive human instincts he claims the optimal stories for
the new media function on an extended middle or an infinite stage of development now certainly some
serialized shows have had successful well-received conclusions but if we can well sorry what shows
have not got endings right now that aren't soap operas like if he's gonna reference shows that
just started if he's like the expanse i mean like it's not even fair they haven't finished this
story is it like every story that isn't finished is currently the middle yeah so stupid oh no it's
infinite you know the only thing i think this applies to goes on indefinitely the only thing
i think this actually applies to is the one example he's saying it doesn't apply to which
is the mcu the idea with the mcu being that i don't think they'll ever let it die i think
they'll keep it going forever even if they run out of stories to tell while stumbling like
breaking bad they were like no it ends at sea i'm pretty sure they planned to end it at season
five from a decent chunk while back game of thrones they wanted it the house season they
wanted it to be three or four seasons i think but because it got really popular they got
basically forced to stretch it out which is what happened to breaking bad but like every tv show
that has ever finished according to this guy it was like it was just going on forever right up
until they made their last season that he was like oh well now that okay there's this really
stupid way to look at it but okay allen whatever does he just assume that every show will never
end until it does and it just shocks him and surprises him i think he would honestly say
like you'd be like no shows ever had you go this one he's like not that one obviously you go what
about this one yeah not that one either you're like what what is okay our modern sensibilities
man you know and again the only thing this applies to i think is the mcu but he's saying
it doesn't apply to the mcu so consider the failure of shows like dextre true blood lost
the soprano they all ended hey the failures of the sopranos excuse me some people didn't like
how some people didn't like the ending here okay so people i'm sure there were some people who
weren't happy with breaking bad like absolutely it's not 100 pleased everyone waltz should have
been captured what's his point here though i'm sorry but sopranos should not be included with
dextre and lost and true blood is he about to argue that they they're the fact that they ended
was the disappointing part is that what he's trying to say because it's not that it's the
writing it's not the fact that they ended people are okay with endings i hate the idea that people
can't take an ending people like it he just argued about catharsis the whole reason we like endings
and of course game of thrones to reach a satisfying end we can start to understand
what we mean by our fixation on the extended middle in game of thrones the highly praised
early seasons introduced a vast and cruel world of realpolitik we also planted tons of little
plots that as the show went on began to sprout and grow there were occasional cathartic moments
but the real honeymoon oh so there was there was a thing that damages your whole argument but if
we just ignore that if we just ignore all the plot lines that close there was some there was
some of that but we're not going to talk about so stupid the idea that like earth is just the middle
like that's all that we do it's just the middle we the big bag was the beginning and it's just
been the middle since then like okay and it will always be the middle forever until it's not the
middle anymore yeah what is the point of this discussion it was a useless way to look at a
story ever and it's and it's also feelings based if this ending wasn't satisfactory so that ties
into my point even though some people may have been satisfied by the ending these moments were
cathartic um but they weren't cathartic to me i i felt these these scenes these big scenes were
more cathartic and and so they they don't count can you imagine forcing alan to watch malcolm in
the middle oh god he's like no malcolm the dark god of the middle does he ever escape the middle
like is that how it ends it's like it doesn't end alan it's still going alan
began to sprout and grow there were occasional cathartic moments but the real honeymoon for
viewers was this stage of perpetual development the more we watched the more invested we became
in this process we ravenously consumed episode after episode yeah because it was good and people
liked it it's all written so no you ravenous Neanderthals yeah that's why i used that word
yeah it wasn't the case we were all audience members we can't pause this ever we have to
watch episode after episode until we're free i can't get over there does he realize the red
wedding was a severe full stop for a large portion of the characters in season three
was the end of their story it didn't that wasn't their middle
and the implication by the way just because game of thrones ended in season eight doesn't
mean it couldn't have continued we could have seen what happens next said living breathing
will there is no story that couldn't necessarily be continued if we're to believe it was a very
well-reasoned yeah that's true for every single story unless there's some cat like a cat unless
there's some reality ending and then that everything is just the middle yeah like the
entire cosmos just ceases to exist what do you mean if he describes end game as the end i'll be
like well no it's kind of the middle this is gonna be it is because there's gonna be more there's
we already have more we got far from home already we got all these films have been announced like
yeah the end game is not the end but it is the end for several characters it's the end of phase
three it's the end of the like original team of avengers like yeah you know there's lots of this
is what i mean about the nuance to he's just like either it's a start a middle or an end it's like
no i mean i don't know what else that leaves us with i think you could simultaneously have a
end game is both the end of x and the beginning of y you know yeah he thinks they're kind of all
relative to what you're examining watched the more invested we became in this process we ravenously
consumed episode after episode conflicts i agree more about denaris and enabled us to get to know
her for instance cynic learning more about her enabled us to get to know it
yeah wait it's not playing the watch together for me oh he just said learning more about denaris
allowed us to get to know it better oh like yeah that's not a that follows i guess i can agree with
that you are you back in or um it just pause yep we're at 7 52 revealed more about denaris
and enabled us to get to know her better from her time with caldrogo to her conquest of slavers bay
to her love affair with john well wait i thought you said the there were no like you know moments
where we got conclusions or any things because only the beginning and end for her there's no middle
oh it's all middle they don't count those don't count when she conquered slavers bay that wasn't
a conclusive ending to that storyline nope wasn't cathartic enough wasn't cathartic enough i mean i
guess he could make the argument that it's not because it gets it gets liberated again but that's
kind of my whole point about how yeah because no story necessarily has ended technically speaking
it could always continue such a weird metric as the show went on the politics got more complex
and we wanted to dive deeper i wouldn't necessarily argue it got more complex so it
starts so they started chopping everything down killing everybody to get like three plot lines
left deeper into the nooks and crannies of the world the show teased us with revelations about
the night king and we felt like we were getting closer to something concrete it introduced us to
new institutions like the iron bank of bravos and we felt like we were moving closer to a complete
understanding of the world the golden age of the show was one in which any catharsis
any finality is perpetually delayed that's not true there are loads of endings he's actually
referencing one right now no no it's all middle so you got tyrian is in prison because he's been
framed for the murder of a king and he is ordered a trial by combat in which the mountain is going
to battle his chosen champion one of them dies resulting in tyrian being damned to death
this is this is the that that is you see how um the season he spends most of it in jail
this is like the climax to his storyline you're like oh god you're gonna die death is only the
middle i would i mean we'll probably revisit this point later but the thing is with if you
have something running for too long if he's saying that we we were so used to the middle
and living in the moment those highs and lows people do get fatigued like if a tv series runs
for too long we stay too long in that middle people get bored of it that's why we like having
an ending and a conclusion my my my whole argument is if breaking bad season six came out and it's
all about jessie trying to rebuild his life breaking bad season five becomes the middle to this guy
which is insane so after the fact it becomes bad yeah and well not necessarily bad he's saying
that neanderthals like it yeah what about what about those people in the in the example of
breaking bad obviously that's the story following walter white he's the main protagonist well
antag frantic or whatever he's kind of like the the bad good guy um and when his story ends
the story is over you can always spin it off and start focusing from someone else's perspective
because the earth still exists with people on it you could still there's still plenty of
characters that we know left um semantic dragon said oh yes obran is about to meet the middle of
his life are you afraid of middle marvel films were always built on a foundation of beginning
middle and end that's not true at all the first one ends with by the way there's gonna be way
more of these and then the rest of them like made fun of constantly for setting up the next one
that's what the marvel movies do that's what they're famous for now is that they're constantly
what he would call middles even endgame is a middle this is what i mean i don't understand
this guy's argument whatsoever because i would actually defend the mcu if someone said to me
you never get much catharsis because of the fact that the story never seems to come to a conclusion
i'd be like oh that's not true you get plenty of storylines that reach conclusions well yeah this
whole thing is a mess i don't understand this argument at all this argument is an absolute mess
and the only thing i reason i think this was made is because what topic at the moment avengers
endgame game of thrones slap that into the title throw in the usual post-modernist bollocks research
alan's work to figure out something to say i don't know they should have copied alan something that sounds
authoritative yeah um stick in the ad for that um chinese piano lessons stick on you there we go
that's a wrap this is such low effort it's awful it reminds me of uh adam kurtis documentaries
i don't know if you've ever seen one of them but he he's an essayist and lots of post-modernist love
him but his problem is he makes a point and he goes on these wild little tangents to try and
fit back to his original point and they make no sense he he'll talk about uh you know the power
of fear and how media controls are fair and then goes on a tangent about and i shoot you not in
one of his documentaries goes on a tangent about radical lesbian nuns and then tries to feed that
back into his original argument and because he edits so quickly and puts in lots of nice sound
bites people often forget his original point but that's the thing when you when you get
oh we've forgotten the original point on efap before yeah yeah but you're not suits you would
never claim to be these intellectual powerhouses who analyze films in ways that you could never
imagine and and bring in these post-modernist thinkers who really don't have much credentials
other than they sound smart uh and actually alan totally sounds smart yeah yeah but another
thing is is there going to be a counterpoint because if you're an essayist one of the things
that you might include in your essays and is seen as good essay writing is to bring in a counterpoint
a counter argument to look at a different point of view i don't think they're gonna do that maybe
he will and that's why they're bad that's why i don't think they could because if they did they
would immediately go oh wait this is dumb i wasted my time exactly i mean if you remember
he glossed over he counted himself and glossed over he was like yeah there are endings to say
the story lies but anyway the big stuff no but anyway there aren't any yeah that's the closest
they'll get to not to showing that they haven't got a bias the throw in a counterpoint that
someone might say like a person in the comments going hang on and they'll briefly they'll mention
it but they won't offer an argument to that point so i'm sure there's loads of YouTube comments going
you did this this and this and they'll go we acknowledge this but we're not going to cover it
even though if you really follow that line of thinking breaks down the entire fucking thing
i wonder how many like passive wisecrack viewers that are that will just sit there and
consume this into their brain and just think that it's true i think this is a channel where i think
a lot of people might be like they listen to the whole thing and then you go what did he just say
and they'll be like uh he said that they would probably cobble together something that he didn't
really say like he sort of said like the you know like endgame has an end bad i saw a vengeance and
i clapped good enough for me that's what it is see the rest of this shit heck by contrast
marvel films were always built on a foundation of beginning middle and end no both within each
installment and the overarching phases that's just what that makes no sense at all they had
they had a set beginning middle and end both in their own stories and the overarching plots it's
like so they had a big that's stupid oh so is that not one big middle i no no it's not apparently
that's okay how is that not the same as game of thrones i got confused because of what i heard
earlier but whatever okay then i got confused only because of what that guy said two minutes ago
how is that not applicable to game of thrones i am outraged i want to kill a cat yeah i'm done yeah
all right built to one final conclusion defeating Thanos interestingly it's not even the end though
i suppose no they don't never mind i'm being you can play a drinking game with this couldn't you
allen says allen said like but that's the make sense but allen says every time the guy doesn't
brush his hair drink every time he says allen drink i don't think you'd make it through the
whole video with people who don't groom themselves before they get on camera i think he does consider
this groomed oh what a hobo that's mean to hobos dude hey he could we can only see the top of him
he might not be wearing any pants i'm not wearing any pants i reckon his pubes look the same
yes unkempt wild wild with no end only middle
infinitesimal pubes spilling out of his trousers
unlike my penis my pubes never end and the overarching phases that built to one final
conclusion defeating Thanos one fight did you catch that one final conclusion it's like oh
you think there's not going to be more conclusions in the mcu really no that's the final conclusion
oh okay all right it's all over yeah they don't want any more money they're not going to make any
more movies this is so dumb but he knows it i think he knew it when he wrote that he was like
final yeah fuck it they won't know i don't think the guy that's reading wrote the script
i really feel like he's just the face of someone else's and i like the fast attempt and then what
the fuck am i reading just come on alan do me a solid you're embarrassing me in front of the
internet al um but yeah you could be like oh this film this won't age well it's like oh well it's
already aged fucking poorly because far from home's out so trip interestingly alan pinpoints a
specific oh it's really fucking interesting with alan point yeah video in games here we go oh god
here comes mario excited go back to my specific cultural culprit for our extended journey into
narrative middles video games in games like the sims roller coaster tycoon or mmo's like wow
you cruise through well you can't just go like games that don't have endings it's like what about
the games that do have endings like what the fuck uh i can see that point yeah there are there
literally exactly we don't have endings because they're a unique genre of game this is exactly
what we said it would be at the beginning he said he would drag games into it with some arbitrary
point when he mentioned video games earlier he showed super mario bros right which has an ending
yes amount of levels and then it's over and now to make his point he's deliberately ignoring
99 of video games i was gonna say more games have endings that don't more games have
pointing to the like the handful that you could just play indefinitely such a bullshit point it's
just a hook it's like how does how does explaining why game of thrones is bad relate to super mario
you're like okay and then also you've got to think about the popularity as well and like
so so if people have been influenced by playing world of warcraft the sims or roller coaster
tycoon to the point where they don't want endings anymore like how many people would that actually
affect the cinema going audience rid of middles video games in games like the sims roller coaster
tycoon or mmo's roller coaster tycoon is very narrative limited as well i don't even this is
the thing roller coasters you look playing like imagine one of his references was like cool of
duty multiplayer you'd be like yeah technically that doesn't have an ending but it also doesn't
really have a beginning yeah games have endings but it just depends on what he defines as an ending
if you're like oh you the match is over he's like yes but the next match is about to begin you're
like what it's like wow you cruise through a never-ending island after all there's no point
where you smoke they literally have end games in them i was about to say can you argue that
there's end games to sims like get all of the best things you get bored you get bored is the
end game that's pretty much uninstall that's the ending yeah eventually you're just done you've
had enough you decide the end but also you get bored of the middle because after a while we've
played some of these games it gets a bit repetitive yeah i want something to end so although he's
arguing that we're so used to the middle the ride never ending actually we are used to it what we do
is we walk away because it's fucking boring we do want a satisfactory ending so so in the sims when
when your character dies they get a tombstone that occupies one square on the floor so the only
way to finish the sims is to occupy every square of the playable area with tombstones so there's
nowhere to build the only way to beat sims is to kill the new family the new family that moves
into the neighborhood can't lay a single brick because there's just tombstones well that doesn't
even end it because you just you're there you're walking around you just can't do any you just start
a new game too i think alan would allow that he'd be like yep that's just another middle and yeah
but is the new game a beginning or is it just another middle shut up you neanderthal
if you're taking your experiences with you but but grogg no like middle yeah i was just thinking
like imagine you had a kid where they just discovered sims you're like oh so awesome
like they they get really burst into it for years they're like i want to show you some of dad you're
like oh what they've done that tombstone thing you're like oh wow can i have that dog
do you think we could do this in real life it's like oh oh it's hitler yeah but if humans lived on
for indefinitely eventually we would run out of places to bury the bodies we'd run out of middle
we would shoot them into space you have space besides all the ones we buried like two thousand
years ago they're mostly embedded into the ground where they'd like push them off in a boat and set
fire to it it'd be like that but you just like propel someone covered in methylated spirits up
into the sky it's like star trek you put them in a torpedo you shoot it out a wonderful cycle of
life yeah i want to make sure that you cruise through a never-ending middle after all there's
no point where you smirk with relief as you've landed your sim the job they've always wanted
and can successfully close the game for good now of course yeah you can if you want why does he
say yeah that's totally up to you does he just mean the game never forces you to quit or something
he he makes it seem like we are slaves you know you know you can never but that's the thing you
stuck yeah you're always playing the sims even if you're not currently playing even when you're
sleeping it's just on pause right now you will always be playing the sims then once you get
yeah you become the sim yeah so like you know the new god of war the fact that there's a new
game plus it's like the narrative ends but it doesn't force you to stop playing it it doesn't
lock you out or anything so it's like is new game plus considered a never-ending middle that's just
the new middle yeah wait is this last of us because this has an end uh it might be yes yeah
to all games some like the last of us yeah he's saying it doesn't apply to war games some
some have it in some games have it in guys maybe i love it when you your argument just falls apart
it is like everybody on earth is male except for those who are female you're like what except for
those are anything else what like this doesn't make any sense why are you even making the statement
in the first place it's like well i don't know there are some games that end like i don't know
the last of us but that's about it there's not many others what is what is he actually going to
say this is just some boys wanted and can successfully close the game for good now of
course this doesn't apply to all games some like the last of us this doesn't apply to oh wait
doesn't quite most can feel toward a conclusion but even in a game like skyrim which does have
a narrative end people get lost in the limitless expanses so your argument means nothing oh yeah
so you have a terrible argument and you're explaining us that your argument's terrible
but some games end some games never end some games have endings but you can continue it's
like congratulations you've played congratulations you've understood games you may as well have just
said sometimes there are games you can you play like a 12 year old that games don't have ends
and they're like but imagine alan sat there playing skyrim just going but but this is all the middle
takes you back to the main menu and he's like well it's not over i can still hit play
yeah the credits haven't they haven't finished rolling so it's still the middle
alan just get the fuck out of my house no i'm stuck here as an audience member you know i'm not
going slowly hammer slowly pulls back and alan's just in the insane insane asylum like it's the
middle just the middle it's all middle he thought he was creating a place but he was just scribbling
on napkins in the cafeteria at some insane asylum of middle side quests another way to view this
phenomenon is there is a finite amount of i was going to say yeah you would by definition they
don't randomly generate uh quests in skyrim right four if you said fallout four then yeah because
there's all bullshit stuff you need to go and do that just indefinitely repeats yeah eventually
generates a quest for you at x location yeah yeah but skyrim is finite i mean as long as
enemies respawn i mean even if there were no enemies requests just walking around it's just
so wrong he's like talking about random genres of video games trying to relate it to game of thrones
when you have plundered a cave or a building or whatever it will show up on the map that you have
done it it's finished it's empty you've taken the treasure so the so the middle you're highlighting
there's a middle there yeah yeah yeah so he's gonna knock out the old psychology look here's
our scientific data even though psychology itself is a soft science but whatever uh i want to see
what he says because i just researched this person's name this video is making me a soft science
people get lost in the list expanses of middle side quests another way to view this phenomenon
is taking a cue from psychology in a recent wired article writer jay david bolter argues
that the phenomenon consumers experience when you know alan and his buddy bolter has great jay
david bolter jay and david do you need two names jesus everyone has two names these days how the
video game aesthetic flows into all of culture ah get out your bagels and shipping that's pretentious
out your bagels that's right yeah and out on some bagels tonight jay david bolter
influence other things congratulations video games are so widespread that they have an
influence on culture all right has this guy heard of things like religion that's going to be a video
that's all just middle mode how the religion aesthetic flows into all of culture that the
phenomenon consumers experience when engaging with modern entertainment is akin to psychologist
mihai cheek sent mihai's was that real wait what what was his name sorry let's hear that again i'm
sorry he doesn't look like a mihai if you get my treatment is akin to psychologist mihai cheek sent
mihai's concept of mihai cheek sent mihai one more time one more time one more time so we can get
he looks like the stock image guy harold me mihai me sent mihai
he was just like really smashed and they asked him what his name was mihai mihai me said mihai
when engaging with modern entertainment is akin to psychologist mihai cheek sent mihai's
mihai cheek said mihai cheek said mihai cheek said mihai cheek said mihai cheek said mihai
mihai cheek sent mihai mr mr cheek sent mihai what would you like to name your beautiful young boy
oh we've agreed that his name will be mihai like mihai cheek sent mihai i just like the idea that
he's trying to explain it's like i am high my cheek it sent me high okay i don't know how to
evolve that this is the thing right if i actually said on the spot he was just trying to make up a
fake name because he didn't want to tell anyone who he was so they don't explain the article
they just go in to explain another psychologist theory this is the third guy now can you tell us
why one of these might be correct or not can you like well for one jay dole vid bolter released
that article because he's got a book out so of course he's got some uh vested interest in getting
his name out there and from what i can tell from my research he his other potential titles the
digital plenitude and the end of art oh fucking hell he sounds like someone i definitely want to
listen to for another second experience when engaging with modern entertainment is akin to
psychologist me high cheek your mom's my mind he must have said it felt silly reading that out
uh feels bad man this is the thing before he was like wow making fun of a name that's not
typically like you're west and i'd be like there are plenty of funny west and that is a hilarious
name there are funny west of names it's yeah i can we get his name has anyone managed to get his
name me high cheeks okay there's a guy me high sent me high yes there's a guy that went to my
uh college who was called uh ugi abhi hey i actually found him i actually typed in oh
oh google didn't confuse that with the other me high cheeks sent me high
uh it gave me that and i forgot his wikipedia there we go oh god that's not a name that's
they're posting it that's just they're posting it in chat and just started walking around
they posted it in chat do you see that like how it's spelled me high cheeks sent me high that's
what i typed in that is not i actually typed it phonetically and actually picked it up well done
google well done google it's probably because everyone else who heard that name did the exact
same thing you did so google is intimately familiar his inbox is going to be filled isn't
it i'm getting all these emails from people they're telling me i've got a stupid name what's going
on he doesn't have you sound like he's not sincerely e-fat listener 749 uh he's hungarian
which is also where hardship hungarian is from uh and yes he's a hungarian american psychologist
he's recognized named the psychological concept of flow a highly focused mental state conduct
conducive to productivity what the fuck has that got to do with super mario in place he's trying
to figure out why he's named to that right fucking hell his whole life his whole life
which is a middle by the way this is his mission to find out why he was named this me high cheeks
and me high oh my god but i it's hard to unravel where the what the main fucking point of any of
this is it's an absolute mess a shit show of ideas of things not fitting we've gone from
amphitheaters to people wearing suits at the cinema to video games but now psychologists to
who talk about flow which is when your mind goes into that state of creativity and productivity
but i call that just that's just being in the zone it's a mess not a mess that's called focus
that's called concentrating we have a word no no it's called flow that is quicker to say
entertainment is akin to psychologist me high she sent me high's concept of flow bolter citing
she sent me high defines flow as a state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing
else seems to matter oh so like 80 hd or something oh alcoholism yeah health is so enjoyable that
people will do it for the sheer sake of doing it yeah that's very familiar concept i mean
the human condition isn't has many of those sorts of things i i think his greater point is
we like things that give us highs and lows dragging on because we get really focused
and into it except if that's not always the case um but people play call of duty but then they also
like the sims but the sims has no end but people like the middles except for the times when they
don't call of duty never ends because war never changes yeah this this is you're just trying to
find a roundabout way of explaining how you never could have ended game of thrones in a satisfying
way and this is all bullshit oh wait oh yeah i forgot this is about game of thrones isn't it
this is all bullshit this is are you so far from the point this is peak video essay this is just
bullshit i genuinely had forgotten that that's what now basketball this concept is my favorite
story i like it how they dribble up and down in the zone theaters mario basketball
oh maybe that's how you'll tie mario back in we need mario explain this concept also gets
used in italian philosopher activities if you've ever been in the zone you've experienced
but but basketball has an end though it matches the end also i disagree i think all sports are
the middle forever no one ever really wins simply pause no one's ever really gone
oh no don't desire nobody's ever really gone we prefer to lose ourselves in the flow of the
viewing but you can call that immersion we have several endings throughout game of thrones
several things are ending people get very upset because it's sad when characters die because it
means you'll not see them anymore their effect is gone ned stark it's one of the like biggest
things the show is celebrated for you're like yeah people don't like endings people don't really
want endings yeah they do bullshit experience this is what perpetual middle offers it offers
never-ending world building never-ending character but it did but it's finished you can't will build
forever or i mean theoretically i guess you could you just run out of interesting or relevant things
to talk about it's like there's a there's a mouse over there gotta go lots of mice live in this area
mice are interesting sort of for development and introductions i like how he's highlighting all
the characters that lived not the hundreds that died as if the you know the story just keeps going
for these guys it's like yep through the fact that they just did die as quickly as the rest
to new plot points that promise to build to something great i mean new plot points that's
the first scene in season one i hear that again there's this stuff guy that offers never-ending
wait if there's new plot points is that not a beginning well this is the thing more middle
that's the implication means that plot points can come to an end but apparently that's only
middle in the grand scheme yeah i was like i feel like if you went to him and just asked hey
what do you mean what do you mean end it would just like short circuit you just mean when the
company decides that the ip is finished so that they've closed it off like it's customary and
conversations define our terms in the beginning so can you tell me what the ends are stopping
somebody in a hundred years from buying the rights to that property and then making more stories in
that world or with those characters or would he agree that the ot was an end until disney made it
the middle would he agree with that i don't know he'd say that it was always the middle it was
always the biggest one yeah it was gonna happen in character development and introductions to new
plot points that promise to build to something great that guy there that's their target audience
he's like yeah let me tell you about her intersexual feminine how this with his fucking upside down
head that is an upside down head that's racist upside down heads are a mistake um so like yeah
the night king was a new addition to an ongoing plot fine i guess that's what he meant by new plot
point but we've been desperately waiting for the white walker storyline to mean something
because it's throughout the show and the biggest awesome element to it was that it kept drip feeding
it and we're like this is going to be the big payoff and then it wasn't it was great but that's
just because nobody could ever be satisfied that's why because it's all middle because of
by his logic then if game of thrones had continued would everyone have been happy
with game of thrones season eight because it's still middle uh what even if it was still the
same if it was exactly the same but they go yeah season nine's coming out next year
what does he think that would be happy it's like oh it's not over so we're happy
you see how everything falls apart i mean i like it it's stupid no
that's the whole point isn't it look we've referenced don't think about it um i could
just picture being like well what about what about alan he's you know he said you know alan
you guys not listen to alan you haven't heard about alan our lord and savior exactly this is
adam kurtis style you make a point and then you go on this convoluted journey to the point where
you actually forget what the original idea was and we we for fucking we call this flow
we just got nonsense yeah sorry he was just experiencing some flow
and didn't realize bad case of flow i can't come into work today i got the flow
new plot points that promise to build something great who cares if it actually ever does land at
that something the build up is in this is this is something about game of thrones and you're asking
that seriously i don't believe he just said that like i was waiting for anybody else to just
who really cares about it it's all about the build up it's like literally the opposite is he
trying to argue it's not the end it's journey but it's both kind of like the journey to be
satisfying you have to have an end otherwise without each other yeah otherwise there's just
a perpetual trek that's why i liked the line in the trailer for endgame that i meant said part
of the journey is the end he was talking about how you know it's been a long journey he's about
to die and that's a part of the whole thing it's just like oh that's interesting thing about it's
like the you have to take the end into consideration of the journey it's not like this it's not like
you have beginning journey end it's the whole thing yeah that's kind of solid because disney's
like okay we're gonna make several other films in phase four but i actually agree that it's the end
of iron man's story you know like he's got to start middle finish whatever you want to say
but like he's like no it's the end it's like it's not the end for the MCU it's far from it
there's still not really the end for iron man either because still like mentioned and the
effect that his actions has had is still being seen like he's still very much a part of the story
i'm referring specifically to him like the man himself like just doing new things his
his influence on the world will obviously outlast him but that's that's pretty standard with most
important figures in there something great who cares if it actually ever does land at that
something the build up is in itself extremely satisfying binge watching serialized tv and
playing video games to quote bolter offers the viewer player or participant not only pleasure
how many video games do you think bolter played
fucking no he's a pro gamer he was fucking played league of legends
fortnite fucking battle royale master after the weapon from warhammer so he's a super gamer it's
over at esports he's surrounded by groupies he can you know 360 no scope like a fucking pro
yeah he's played him in league of legends or some shit i don't know benjamin in chat
said it's over anakin i have the middle ground also the seductive possibility that the moment
might go on indefinitely oh oh wait i want to look at that what let's go yeah that makes no
fucking sense wait put the pro gamer back on and what does he know about seduction yes
oh can you just go seduce a game of thrones and video games offer the viewer player or
participant not only the pleasure in the moment but also the seductive possibility that the moment
might go on indefinitely yeah um that's so seductive the idea that i will never ever ever
stop doing one thing forever i was gonna say that can totally go both ways the idea like
sometimes it's detrimental for games to not have goals to work towards because otherwise people
will be like why am i here and for the most part right now i prefer a more casual experience where
i can like play a game that i pick up for like five minutes and just play it and then get on with
my life i don't want it to go on forever that sounds like hell but to false equivalency video
games and films and tv it's it's not the same well i mean that's the weird thing that he's applying
it to game of thrones a series that has ended i guess he's trying to say that's why people are
unsatisfied oh yeah game of thrones has obviously already finished yeah yeah because he's about to
argue i think the the reason people are unhappy with game of thrones is because nobody ever wanted
it to end they wanted to go on forever no no not true at all but but these people with two names
uh sound important so i just love the idea that we had jay david bolter here right now and he's
like but people play video games for a long time yes yes yes point yes jay they do
isn't that the funny thing when you when you actually put break it down to layman terms
what they're saying is is utter bollocks it when you break it down behind they hide behind big
words don't they they hide behind their vocabulary to sound smart but actually when you layman terms
so what you're saying is people play video games for a really long time and that's like watching
tv for a long time uh there you go uh nobody ever wanted game of thrones to end and it should go on
indefinitely forever for generation nobody wanted place to end well if you look at this quote he's
got but also the seductive possibility that the moment might go on for indefinitely if you were
to try and cut it down you'd be like but also that the moment might go on indefinitely you can
literally cut out seductive possibility it's not like why is it active well that's the thing
you just highlighted it's like it makes it sound more you know fleshy you're like oh he's saying
things okay so that's that's that's it possibility this doesn't feel like academic writing well you
don't need the word possibility and might in the same moment he's like it's gonna it's possible
that it might go on forever it's like so pick one are you saying it well or not it's possible
it'll go on forever or that it'll go on it might go on forever maybe you'll all be the middle and
again no counter argument to any of this they say these names of media types as if it's as if it's
true that the no counter argument is very superfluous there's a lot of filler and again a lot of it is
very subjective stuff this is all very feelings based because it's psychologists and things like
that but what might be true of one person's feelings it's not gonna be true of another's
maybe i played with a game and go i really can't wait to finish this level because it's completed
and i feel like i've done something i'm confused as well as watching a tv show is it you don't
watch game of thrones going i can't wait for this fucking thing to end i've been sitting in all time
i wish i could get through this scene and why hasn't he referenced soap operas like isn't that
the easiest thing to go for they just never end they literally just go on forever
and how many video game reviews castigate video games for too much grind like i could
are there are there american soap operas oh yeah absolutely days of our lives how many seasons have
there been of days of our lives yeah yeah i'm talking about someone so like over here we have
east enders coronation street uh first episode was november 19 65 number of episodes thirteen
thousand six hundred thirty-five that sounds like alan's worst nightmare yeah they are the true
never-ending middle it's not even but that's the thing even i would be like well not really because
they'll keep having stories that have been getting middles and ends enduring them new characters get
introduced new scenarios get set up you know like it's just an ongoing set of stories still just
the exact same characters well in some cases i want to see if there's been a character that
started as like a teenager on one of these shows and it's like it you know like like oap if you
were born the day the first episode came out you would be fuck 1965 and it's 2019 you'd be 54 years
old i remember someone did the math on how how many hours of the day you would have to if you
wanted to catch up to days of our lives you're like i'm really invested someone i actually read
somewhere someone calculated how many how long it would take you to get caught up speeds we're
talking years you would have to be basically alan alan would be right in this occasion you would
never be able to pause you would have to be staying in school for years no he supports the
idea of closing the 13 600 episodes the episodes are owing for commercials what 40 minutes each
oh 40 shit is it not an hour long i don't know what are we talking about days of our lives we're
talking about something else we're definitely talking about days of our lives this is on this
is efap but we're talking we're calculating uh days of our lives statistics so um
let's see let me go to the official official days of our lives a wikipedia 30 30 minutes
and then it was 60 minutes from 1975 onwards all right so for the most part it was an hour long
so for the vast majority of its time for like 80 it was 10 years of 30 minutes and then the rest is
all right we're gonna go with 40 minutes so 40 we'll go with 50
did it have breaks over like holiday seasons or anything
well we know how many days a week i love that this is happening right now so uh so we have
13 600 episodes fucking tv show okay 13 600 um times let's go with 40
so that's 21.76 million minutes of days for lives that's a lot of middle now let's divide
that by 60 to get hours so that's 362667 hours of days divide by 24
well no that can't be possible i fucked up along the way
i need time to sleep no yeah no i fucked up well i i must not be thinking if there are
13 600 episodes you can't get more hours than that no i must have done something wrong along the way
13 6 no i'm not good at math sue me um so what was it 13 600 yes i multiplied by 40 to get minutes
which is 544 000 yeah which i was already a different number so i must have clicked a wrong
number so divide that by 60 yeah so now you get 9 066 hours then divide that by 24 i must have clicked
uh i must have clicked an extra button or something 377 days so that's a whole year yeah it's just
over a year all right all right of constant watching so that's no sleep no food nothing you
have to sit there you can eat while watching yeah but how are you gonna prepare the food
you can prepare food while watching you can hire someone to prepare the food for you and you could
have a shit bucket so you could hire someone to sleep quite an investment for days of our lives
let's do it it's worth it it's worth it it's worth it to know what happens in the middle
timothy dimera or whatever that's a long time to spend in the middle yeah that is not if you invite
your friend out also the seductive stories for days that the moment might go on indefinitely
point is if you consider this possibility all right so do people not feel that when they
watched plays or when they're reading books because i know i sure as hell felt that when
i was reading a book i didn't want the stand to end i didn't want the count of money cristo to end
oh yeah 100 yeah he talks as if people go to the theater and then they immediately expect people
to suddenly lock the doors behind them we go no you're in this play forever like some sort of
play knocking no people do one and i really think there you could you could have had a whole video
talking about why we have to have endings and why human beings desire endings like we we love
endings to stories the things never ended we would have no people because everyone would
be perpetually having sex and there would be no come exactly and we and that's very seductive
it's all the middle it's just this this is just terrible and it ignores so many things just to
make a pretentious video might go on indefinitely okay wait i think we might we've got something
wrong here because on bingeclock.com it says that to watch every episode of days of our lives it
would actually take 470 days and one hour well like i said direct so you should have times about 50
and one hour yeah but but what you're not taking to count is you have to catch up with the year
you've spent watching days of our lives oh fuck you're right that's right so how many episodes
you're out here and then you would miss a year and so you've got to watch the year oh shit but
that wouldn't add that much time so it's like you know like when you're trying to measure the
distance between the start and the end of something and then you half it this process will never end
binge clock days of our lives like i said you averaged on a 40 minutes 50 minutes would probably
been more accurate well it says one it says one hour and if you buy if you went to watch them you
would buy like dvd box sets so it wouldn't have the commercials in there okay this is the fourth
longest binge watch are you fucking shitting me okay the longest would be coronation street
no it says um it says the guiding light is that some christian bullshit is it still going i don't
know um i'm actually gonna i've never heard of it what about when did when did qvc as a channel
begin the guiding light began in 1952 damn i bet they had no idea when they started but it but
but it ended in 2009 oh so even though it began before it ended there it ended alan wanted years
ago alan will be like no the longest running show had an end oh it's primitive anyway people want
plays i know what people want none of this netflix stuff we have the cbs late movie
and then as the world turns is after that
right i've never even heard of any of these fucking shows i haven't either well it's like
when james charles was in the news i've never heard of him but he has like 10 13 million subs
and never heard of the guy yeah that the moment might go on indefinitely point is if you consider
this shift in media it becomes appropriate to ask could game of thrones have ever achieved a
satisfying ending yes yeah duh of course a fucking course like what's the you haven't even presented
an argument for why it couldn't yeah it did alan said will the warcraft exists oh okay
like ironically that's this video what cheek me high i am high because of my cheeks
oh this is really confusing because the bald guy with glasses who said it was seductive
was also working in the theory of another psychologist who was talking about flow
that quote didn't really incorporate flow that was more about enjoying something whereas flow is
more of a state of being focused on productivity yeah i think they just wanted to main drop one more
like researcher i actually think it does help your video essay if you cite some prestigious
sounding person because people be like oh you did your research one problem they probably did was
just google some guy let's not think about it beyond that let's just assume that it's correct
because you just quoted someone and like i love the lack of info he's given to relative to game
of thrones like to talk about it as if just like he just concludes this it's like about game of
thrones like why game of thrones why do you want to talk about the story of game of thrones is like
no like oh okay it's such a broad topic isn't it because the reason people were the reason people
were unhappy the consensus was the writing was bad it wasn't bad oh we loved it so much we didn't
want it to end we were quite happy to give it a break for a year while they re did you know where
they shot the next series the problem is it ended really badly had nothing to do with the middle
with all its catharsis it was just really badly written and that's he's not acknowledging that
but he wants to be this pseudo-intellectual contrarian oh no no no i have this i have this
this is why this is why you don't like it you're not smart you're not watching you don't understand
he also hasn't addressed how how end game escaped this fate
uh because it's not like video because it's allowed to end basketball
um yeah i'm really missing the point now that he's trying to make and look how much time he's
got he's probably got another fucking ad so how many more times is he gonna say alan bring alan
back in you can bring it home could a show built on the honeymoon period of extended middle ever
really you've not established that this is this is a show built on extended middle that doesn't even
make sense look there's some grass stats he's got some stats it's got to fly in the same way with
the conclusion a quick look at this collection of graphs that charts oh fuck a quick look at this
collection who gives a shit about user submitted reviews look at that's not a good metric look at
the sexism what does this conclude exactly really satisfy in the same way with the conclusion a quick
look at this collection of graphs that charts the quick scores of shows as they approach their series
finale is telling most of the serialized shows tank when they arrive at their end okay so did
house of cards did any of that have to do with like kevin spacey okay yeah house of cards season
one and two are really good season three is mostly okay and then it starts to fall apart season four
is terrible season five is an absolute disaster and then season six i haven't even watched but
apparently that's the lowest rated one yeah but it also doesn't have kevin spacey is murdered at
the beginning of it off screen spin off yeah it's a spin off because of external bullshit that
happened that you can't use that evidence that's the thing these all have contexts that are really
important yeah correlation does not equal causation and imdb is not a metric well i can make the same
argument it's not a surfing company you have special companies that do surveys imdb is not
representative of everyone's thought in the populace i will also i'll give an equally
shitty argument and just use the exact same graph my whole essay is about how writers literally get
abducted by aliens and replaced with poor writers when they get to the end of their shows look at
this graph this explains it okay i don't know that that proves aliens it's like yes it does
i mean you could look at the office and people really like that so it is possible he's about
to argue that that's different because the office isn't intelligent people intelligent people only
watch the beginning of shows and dumb people stay and watch them through to the end and that's
reflected here by these graphs that i found both buffy and angel shows buffy and angels are shows
that uh had long running storylines and they both ended very satisfactorily to audiences but let's
not bring up any shows that ended in what about breaking bad that totally breaks this yeah and he
even mentioned it earlier now he's just denying it go ignore it for this while the episode he's
specifically oh so yeah so his argument rags is that all the shows that start and end with every
episode as in you could watch them all out of order and it wouldn't make much of a difference
uh they end happily people are happy with the endings and it's probably because they don't
have a perpetual they don't have a perpetual middle yeah but that's that's what i mean it's not even
necessarily true like a lot of like community is a comedy that uh you could argue is self-contained
but they still have a basic plot progression that goes through each of the storylines but funnily
enough you'd be like yeah but that had a poorly rated final season it's like yeah the writing
was shit in the last season though or at least it was shit i don't know about shit parks and rec
can't really be counted either there because there is there is progression happening through
the story big bang theory is the same constantly the office is the same constantly like nothing
really changes everyone same roles and stability and it's just episodic but yes i know this is a
really good example the things you would argue never in the middle it's like it was like serious
dramas and these are just fucking sitcoms basically i mean this is the peak of cherry
picking to fit his argument so just to clarify everybody his argument is when you have a start
middle finish in every episode like friends or shows like these everyone is happy for them to
end at any point but when you have a show that has a running plot line that develops nobody wants
it to end and therefore rates the last season badly okay fine show me a graph like this for
the simpsons which is episodic but has seen a a definite decline yeah the ratings will be
dramatically different because this is the thing i would rather attribute all of these to writing
not to whatever the hell you know why that's happened to the simpsons because it hasn't
ended because it's gone on for so fucking long and everyone bored and they've covered every topic
imaginable that it's just it's just run out of steam yeah which completely is counter to what
this guy's trying to say that we want everything to last forever for some fucking because we're
dumb neanderthal netflix you know i can argue people highly rated the endings of these shows
because they mostly hated these shows everyone just tend to hate them so they were really happy
when they ended as much fucking support evidence i just have to reference you know j joda car
michael the scientist from under the ground that's his whole thing most of the serialized shows
tank when they arrive at their end while the episodic shows maintain favorability much more
gracefully this can't be a coincidence it's not it's it's literally about the writing i love how
the simplest answer is the correct one like if it was well written yeah people would be digging it
these very specific examples i've chosen to prove my point can't be a coincidence
i still think there's validity to the alien theory i don't know
it can't be that all the competent writers leave before the final season why no it doesn't you don't
have to know no that happens all the time it's one of the reasons certainly i'm for simpsons yeah
because it they lost some of the writing teams who made great strokes and it went it happens
since when stuff change since when is it only possible for a person to either make good or
bad things you can't that they can only make one look at ridley scott he made alien and he made
prometheus explain that allen does he does he not remember the writers strike that hit hollywood
like 10 years ago that drastically affected shows and their ratings because the caliber of
writing went to shit and no shows didn't end how does he explain breaking bad in the middle
yeah in the in the middle of some tv series they had a writer strike that to change up some of the
writers and the shows went to shit and then maybe they got some of the rights back it's
all he's saying here's maybe it's harder to do one than the other doesn't mean it's not about
whether it's possible and i would actually agree with that by the way it's way easier to end
a self-contained episodic tv show than a one that runs a plot line from literally
episode one up to episode 100 yeah writing isn't easy but but when when people finish
a video game do they go on meta score websites and then go downvote them i was enjoying it so
far but now i'm gonna downvote it what it ends it's not it's square peg round hole and it is just
not fitting no matter how much you mash it against there much more gracefully this can't be a
coincidence it can't be that all the competent writers leave before the final season or that
only episodic tv attracts talented artists as if anyone would make those arguments jesus christ
i love how he he only tackles two of the stupidest arguments you could come up with
like maybe all the talented people leave on the last episode i don't know what's more extreme than
a straw man a paper a jelly man i came up with that one of the schoolmen yeah that was like
episode seven of uh efap i think i said about quinton taking my arguments and he turned he made
a jelly man out of him it's like a straw and then i think i said he still didn't even counter the
jelly man like he made a really bad argument so the jelly man like killed him the jelly man just
kind of wobbled onto him and suffocated yeah he fell into his mouth and he choked on the jelly
when you lose to a jelly man that's uh in a bad spot
there's leave before the final season or that only episodic tv attracts talented artists it's
not that we need to stop criticizing game of thrones again we made a whole video doing just
that but media like game of thrones may not be built to end like cinematic universes that's so
dumb uh and cinematic he just said it isn't built to end like a cinematic universe has ended well
yeah the emcee was over it's still going what the fuck i mean but i guess technically the monsters
universe is over after the only ones that ended began yeah the only ones that have ended are the
ones that couldn't make money to go on that's it the other ones are still going media like game
exactly and then that's not right yeah as in part profit is this is stupid hate it can end like
cinematic universes are with serialized television we don't seek the catharsis that is perhaps
implicit in a contained narrative experience one is built to end the other to keep on going the
mcu hasn't ended argument is flawed what about franchises like star wars that that's going on
for years if you had told me one of my counter arguments today would be explaining that the mcu
hasn't ended i wouldn't have believed you has a franchise ever ended has anyone ever announced
the only end of a franchise they would yeah that's the thing i'm pretty sure star wars ended like
george was like i'm not making any more and i'm not selling the rights it was like it's ended
until it doesn't until someone buys it and then continues that's the thing it doesn't really
everything is middle he was right alan was right nothing's ever really gone but but we don't enjoy
the middle because we didn't enjoy fucking the last jedi and that's the middle of a trilogy
isn't it so this argument is full of holes pretty suitable that he said that all we ever do is
full of holes it is just a big hole he is a hole well a hole is full of holes he is a hole yeah
a giant hole is just lots of little holes put together one is built to end the other to keep on
so what do you guys think we get means we've shared what we think
the ways in which that means that means pretty dated i'm sorry to drag that into it come on guys
yeah well memes memes were made to end will there ever be an end to a serialized tv show
that's better than its extended middle what yes angel's ending was better than the majority of its
middle wait what end to a serialized tv show that's better than its extended middle let us
know what you think in the comments will there ever be an end to a serialized television show
that was better than its extended middle that's his fucking question yeah how would you even measure
i don't know i don't actually know how you fucking measure that like is it literally just
by episode ratings you go from finale an episode be better than like multiple seasons like i don't
even what kind of fucking question is that well i think there was more character development in
those 10 seasons of the show than in this one episode so i think that's better like what metric
do you use that what makes shows what a strange question okay okay we're gonna ask the audience
something at the end i'm curious if we got another ad coming comments thanks to all our patrons who
support the channel and our podcast is that it don't forget to hit that subscribe button
and before you go i want to give another shout out to wix and i have to fight we have to find
out about little little chin kin lee's oh yeah or whatever lee hi cheek you want to find out about
him me high cheeks me high me high cheeks cheeks me cheeks me high me high cheeks sent me high
that was it chick cheeks sent me high behind me so what do you think of that video guys
uh i ain't getting those he raised some very good points they get like hundreds of thousands to
millions of views this is terrible this is awful it like they got a full career from just
spouting bullshit it's just looking here let me regurgitate something i read someone else say
i guess that's how it like removes responsibility too because you'd be like this is a bullshit
theory it's like it was not mine it was it was jay so it was that was allen and me high cheeks
i was just giving alan to alan's theory i was just like something completely irrelevant i'm
waiting to find out alan's not even real like he's just they just make up these guys
it's felt like an algorithm spunked it out because it has popular things in it
game of thrones video games and the avengers these are all really popular things on the internet
how can we fit that into an essay to help our youtube career um make it so give it an
open-ended stupid question that will never be happy with endings because we've played too many
video games or something like that that sounds stupid well we can sponsor them with stats and
nice sounding sound bites from academics there we go that's a wrap what a piece of shit
have you seen uh austin mcconnell's video where he got uh this video sponsored he got an ai to
write a script for a movie and then he got another ai to script that the ai wrote for a movie
and it starts off kind of okay and then just descends into absolute nonsense
i think i read snippets of it yeah i mean that's what gedelbe is it's supposed to feel like it's
generated by an ai just says pretentious things but it's it's all built from actual quotes from
real people that's what makes it so great you just go up to the wisecrack video machine and you just
type in three buzzwords and it just mashes some kind of video to get from what i understand
wisecrack used to be good a lot of people tend to say that like there's a couple people in chat
saying they used to like this channel i think they once they got super popular and they started to um
you know like crank out content super fast yeah it's just like they're just right and just
end game fucking game of thrones uh ones hated ones like we come up with like a
philosophical theory as to why it's like people like things that last long world warcraft go
yeah i still don't see how mario ties into any well there's no counter-argument as well
it was all by it was stupid it was poorly concerned if you gave if you were if that was
an actual written essay you would get very low marks assuming your professor didn't subscribe
to postmodern too much which unfortunately is quite a lot of professors you would get
marked down that is a poorly constructed unless your professor was allen yeah he's like i see
you've taken inspiration from one of the better writers of our world you know like can you believe
that a video game that relies on a subscription model in which you pay monthly never ends
sanity in can you oh we're kind of a force is driving that phenomenon this next one right
so this is gonna be weird because we're not watching the full video but this is called the
walking dead why do we love the zombie apocalypse it's pretty i watched the whole video because i
was curious um it's pretty tame analysis it's just like a basic reason for why we might be
attracted to watching zombie stories and stuff the interesting thing is and someone wrote this in
the comment section that's why i've actually got these times specifically i didn't have to do this
myself from one minute oh seven to one minute 20 there's an ad from five minutes six to five
thirty five there's an ad and then from seven twenty seven to the end of the video there's an
ad so that's wait five took a third a third of the video basically pretty much uh which is
apparently why it pissed off a lot of people it's just like such limited content for anything
but anyway i was watching it i was like i wanted to guy i don't know how bizarre this sounds okay
but we're doing this we're gonna go to the last portion of the ad i want us to judge the quality
of this ad okay like let's pretend for a second that you were like let's let's let's watch some
ads to see if we want to get some um some some products let's see if he sells you on this this
thing because this is really what dystopic dreams are it's gonna start in like 15 seconds restart
in a more simplified world thinly veiled by the apparent horror of dystopic collapse and it's not
just the walking dead between bare grills naked and afraid and survivor man the shock of living a
simpler existence provides the same kind of escape as space travel did 50 years ago so what do you
think is our love of the walking dead a resignation to the hopelessness of it all or do we just love
seeing zombies get stabbed in the brain speaking of stabbing zombies in the brain but check out
some more of the walking dead no man's land here's my camp you can see how much time i've been put in
meticulously organizing it you know great build i don't already i'm like well not really so
meticulously organized you've got like five what vegetable things over there and the camp
why would you spend gold to upgrade buildings that doesn't make any sense in a zombie apocalypse
that's like is like do you want to upgrade your building yeah do you have gold ingots
yeah that is a bizarre currency to have because surely that building is going to be providing you
a shelter and nobody's made of gold there's a gold they just don't be a part of someone's gold
playing around you just take it it's collapsed yeah i just love the fact that that's why they're
telling you to stockpile gold today because of inflation you just build a golden house it's not
worth anything also note it's like no it's like enthusiasm too but yeah just the idea that he's
like look at how meticulous this is like i don't it looks like a mess on my screen but okay maybe
of stabbing zombies in the brain but check out some more of the walking dead no man's land here's
my camp you can see how much time i've been put in meticulously organizing it you can upgrade
buildings to get more resources of all your equipment armor and people i've been dumping
all my experience into darryl because he can mow down rows of walkers now i'm going to put him
on my team for this story mission so it looks like i have to get into these supplies so clear
this with your gun uh it looks like i have to protect abraham while he opens it this is my
favorite part like this is an official ad thing like he has to actually sound like he cares does
he not this is my favorite part this is my favorite part oh yeah let me get this so good you can see
how much i enjoy it mission so it looks like i have to get into these supplies so clear those
guys out wow uh it looks like i have to protect abraham while he opens it wow okay this is my
favorite part now time to get out without dying unfortunately because i played this game i can't
enjoy the ending michel almost got killed yep oh but thank god it's for completing this is my
favorite part i like the this is having the complete opposite effect he would have intended
he's like please buy this with like no now time to get out with that dying favorite part and save
at last this is my favorite value and they made a pretty fun game of opening boxes for some random
rewards they also they made a pretty fun game of opening up boxes yeah for some random rewards
go and fuck yourself just look just go go and have the zombies just line up and fuck you one at a
time look at it though it looks like you just tapped some of the open it's the most basic
fucking opening system ever completing the mission and they made a pretty fun game of opening boxes
for some oh is that a fun game no that's a fun game i don't understand people will do anything
for my they'll just do anything i know right show the shitty game yeah fuck it why not this
is my favorite part yeah here's the thing like movie tie-in checks movie tie-in video games are
bad enough but dead ass tv show tie-in mobile game that's a whole new level garbage this week's
special bundle unlocked in nine hours and 26 minutes i'm gonna go ahead and bet you could probably pay
to get that up faster oh i would hope so that's how you know it's a quality game really you know
this i'll bet after this video released they had to pay the walking dead because so many people
didn't buy it in fact uninstalled they owed amc money after this let's play one it looks like you
get to relive rick and company securing the prison it's just like these entrances where walkers
keeps my favorite you know make sure they don't murder me in the process so i've got to get that
dumpster blocking it why then this fence blocking it they could still clearly get

fucking glens over there with a knife he's doing all the fucking like work what the fuck this is
america and the zombie apocalypse there are more guns than people there's no reason i need to be
walking up to zombies with a knife you can save your ammo it makes the game more exciting
it's very exciting walkers in my way wow i guess this is home sweet home now thanks again to next
game i don't understand why i don't understand why using darryl's power was favorite part when
i think pushing the dumpster was probably my favorite part that looked really fun yeah that's
actually pretty good yeah it's a really fun forward to unlocking the dumpster pushing perk
you can upgrade the perk to either push small dumpsters further and faster or to push larger
dumpsters this dumpster is going to take nine hours to push would you like to pay would you
like to spend gold to make it go faster here darryl i know you have to push that dumpster but
if you give this little this little goblin some gold he'll help you push it quicker
hi i'm randy the god of the goblin i'll help you push your dumpster to escape the zombies if you
give me cold ingots like i just can't get over it the guy casually switches from like the game
footage just out of it it's just like oh right we're watching something else and that's a ton

sacrifice a bit of dumpster oh dude if we all collectively kill a million walkers we get a
golden club million walkers just 12 people who like it says rarity legendary and it's like yeah

hyperion guild with me i'm Slavoj Zizek and taught his farking bestiej which i'm gonna go ahead and
guess these two never played the game again they they play it every day they love it well i think
he calls himself Slavoj Zizek apparently as in the commie philosopher Slavoj Zizek the famous commie
full of bullshit philosopher Slavoj Zizek yeah is that his in-game handle or his actual name
i don't know i don't why why does he want to be associated with a communist philosopher
it's called fucking bastige these just don't sound like real people's names told as a botched
reference to some movie there's 17 slots left in the guild so hurry on up wow 17 slots i'm
imagining there's a lot of slots now i can't wait to play the walking dead with my favorite youtubers
i just ring that bell thanks for watching wisecrack
i asked crack now i need to just i just need to get that bit again this is my favorite part
i definitely did that by accident great this is my favorite part this is my favorite part
story mission you need you need to get like an efap sound board this is my favorite part
it's like can you imagine saying that like right before you come in some bitch do you think anybody
like proof this like someone washes like dude you sound like death you're just slapping it in
there and then all of a sudden this is my favorite part this is my favorite part
get into the supplies to clear those guys out uh it looks like i have to protect abraham while
he opens it uh this is my favorite part it's beautiful abraham is your favorite part
you don't understand it looked like they were losing anyway there's just zombies everywhere
amazing oh man so devoid of any enthusiasm yeah that i guess pissed off their audience
quite a bit and uh yeah i can imagine why wisecrack are an interesting beast
but yeah the so there's someone else i i actually meant to do this before the videos but hey
whatever as long as i do it at some point so um there was uh you know the the stream that me rags
and cynics snacks were all part of the goliath stream oh yeah the infamous it uh that was an
amazing stream it uh it got linked on the subreddit that doesn't like us and i wanted you to see three
comments that are just amusing to read oh great this is in relation to the goliath orphan bode
density osmichick in the stream all right all right guys this isn't the first time this has happened
they did something similar to cinema wins similar to patrick willams similar to fuck it i really
think these twisted shells of men cannot be saved or redeemed in any fashion there is no way they'll
stop acting the way they do no matter how many times a reality fucks them in the ass they are
an insult to film criticism they are an insult to the star wars fandom they're an insult to the
objectivity versus subjectivity debate they are an insult to youtube hell they are an insult to the
human race um so we just talk about movies yeah i yeah i didn't i didn't know that we're an insult
to the human race by talking about star wars it's like whoa um like it blows my mind that we would
we would upset someone to that degree uh but the twisted shells of men it's like did you watch the
stream did you see what we were talking about like really we're just having fun while cynic
tried to survive in that alleyway so uh the next one up all right all right click the link here
all right a whole lot of talking with nothing to say i'm sure they've sat on their ass calling
people special snowflakes how much of an ego do you have to have to record yourself doing nothing
for hours and call it content what do you want us to do people watch it funny memes doing nothing
i was running away from rapid dogs in an alleyway in the philippines that's something
all right i like that they said calling special snowflakes it's like what
what do we have we ever even done that we probably have at some point but
yeah not not not at all for the currents but
patrick willams made a video about tlj that was really well made then talked about trying to
enjoy a movie and focusing on the experience and not searching for plot holes these dirt bags did
a multiple hours long video where they constantly paused it and laughed out loud through the whole
thing that's where i decided that no one who watches these dicks is worth my time oh no we
laughed at his hero patrick williams um but yeah this shit is gold to me i can't believe we make
people feel this way this is insane it's like how do you get this really fab i'm sorry that you
feel that much about anything it's it's hard isn't it people are so invested in fandom
any criticism taken as a personal insight different opinion silly you're uh you're cutting
out a little bit i don't know sorry like random words sorry about that uh no i was just saying
that it's it's strange how people are so invested in their fandoms that any criticism feels like a
personal attack on them and not a difference of opinion which you're entitled to i mean i don't
know anybody who can have you ever heard someone say you're not entitled to an opinion especially
when it comes to movies i wish i wasn't such a dirt bag so where will we live in
there are some memes can i get them ready this is my favorite part
is this it's not a huge amount but they're all related to this wonderful stream
how do i not present
uno memento
you know how it be with the memes
sometimes people don't think it'd be like it is but it do
people don't think it'd be like that but it do
you allen in the middle
i like that allen in the middle i wasn't a woman so that's cool
allen you're embarrassing me in front of the internet
this is actually relatively deep reference but i think we all know it
allen allen
this guy is just it's like his imaginary friend allen
it's all about the middle i swear
oh mario ruined game of thrones
he eventually got there i swear oh this goes all the way to the beginning
spider knight
now he's shooting people in different ways
tob bale samuel l kade zadiah ledger kobe oldman john eckhart jake jillenhull wait actually
oh damn oh wow yeah that actually works i didn't think about that
the marissa freeman and that is it for me maru's um very good work guys very quick turnaround
on those memes oh yes medium wonderful stuff um i guess i'll start uh reading the good old
super chats because that's actually all of i mean i've got a backup tonal video but i always feel
bad about doing tonal without wolf being here because wolf you know tonal's his favorite and
i feel like it would be really evil to take that away from him yeah
but yes that video wasn't very good wisecrack might still be decent as a channel overall i
don't watch this stuff not a great first impression though i'm sure you guys would agree
yeah definitely not um definitely not good i mean they've got videos where apparently they're
criticizing like the story writing or the the just an analysis of the plot of game of thrones i'm
like i'm curious if they actually ripped into it or if they tried to take like um a weird middle
ground of some kind and avoid uh take advantage of both sides of the argument but sometimes
can damage your uh channel to do that so i'm curious but the idea was misleading though
oh yeah the whole fucking video was misleading we had no idea where we were going
openings but uh this is about video games what it's not about video games it's actually about
psychology and how you like the middle what now actually it's about roman uh greek amphitheaters
what it's crazy um it's schizophrenic lucky venus 11 and have you guys seen lucky number 11
yeah a long time ago i like that movie it's good it was fun anyway it was about all the
loads of different uh assassins right to a degree trying to get one target like two big
powerful people in a city trying to get each other killed by accident okay i think i can't
all i remember is the there's a big twist and i remember what it is still so huge ensemble cast
yeah i have seen it i do remember being like meh it's okay about it it was a long time ago
yesterday wisecrack released a video saying anime is fascist
all right hi rags hi hey hello all my smelly niece that is a reference to they didn't put
the last word on there oh response to wisecrack good they've been really clickbait lately may
the blessed pipeman and the dawn bless the stream if they did rags loves them
penis-dicked cumber bath water oh that's something we could ask hey cynic snacks
if someone willingly purchases another person's bath water and drinks it do they deserve to get
herpes um it really depends on their knowledge of the behaviors and hygiene of the person they're
purchasing it from and if it is safe to assume that there's probably going to be some in the water
then that's your own fault so you would define how much someone deserves a thing by how much is
their fault that these circumstances take place well yeah because if they think there's a if you
know you you can estimate i guess but on your knowledge of the individual what is the pot like
percentage chance that the bath water is going to contain herpes and then you drink it based on that
tell us tell us how we'd find that out i guess just knowledge of their intimate
personal life and how many partners they've had or how they behave so what so you're saying that
if it was a random person's bath water that you decided yes i will drink this you don't deserve
to get hippies well if you don't have any information to go off then that in itself
is a stupid thing to make you you couldn't possibly figure out the order so you're basically
do you do deserve hippies let me let's uh let me ask you this if you are a doctor and you go to
work in a leper colony do you deserve to get leprosy um you don't deserve to get it no but it
is a risk of the job all right so you don't okay all right just all right just curious you
have to be willing to get it but you don't deserve it at all so we're talking about delphine's bath
water in hell there was there was a debate you say bath water and everybody just assumes we're
talking about delphine i'm just saying because it wasn't there i think there was a smear campaign
saying people drank it and they got herpes it was all fake clickbait oh yeah it was all bullshit
yeah yeah i don't i don't i i don't even think it's genuine bath water honestly just i think
she would i think she would be putting herself in huge legal trouble if she actually sold that
although she did send a parcel containing a tupperware of probably about a week's worth of spit
oh my god she sent that to ethan cline oh yeah no way as a present yeah i would have like opened
it up on stream and looked at it and it was all like milky and thick and gross oh god that's her
cum uh that's her lady cum but yeah snacks do you think you you might do merchandise
that caliber you're thinking imagine you could sell bits of your cheese you're gonna put some
peaches grease pizza i'd never do i'd never do liquids but you did solids oh god hey i'm not
saying so crumbs and pepperoni who knows who knows what else i'd make solids no he's assumed you
have solids a part of you that you would rip off yourself and sell the people yeah maybe if they
would regenerate um your law is really confusing snacks regenerating pizza i don't know it makes
sense because it wouldn't last very long if he was just a sentient pizza like a couple days
gotta fall the fuck apart this is a particularly greasy one it was like sealed completely
and then you know there's a lot of other questions there were for biology so
you're applying lots of assumptions to my existence i am that is what i does
you you have a mouth so presumably you have the entire digestive system so presumably you do poo
as well do you poo out the back or at the bottom of the triangle the bottom of the triangle is
uh my weenis oh that makes sense but so much like how you humans can expel you humans uh liquids
from your body through sweating i do that with all of my waste so all of it just comes out in
the form of grease through my front oh i thought that whatever you ate became your toppings
oh no i'm always mushroom okay that's just my race we're a new race we will prevail
that's a beautiful piece of fan art right there oh where
uh but yeah we just shared with the classic it's it's just resurfaces all the time
time it all started with uh it all comes down to bath water leading to a discussion on what does
it mean to deserve an event occur to you something to happen to you what does it mean to deserve
something a very interesting one i like asking everybody i asked uh jeremy on geeks and gamers
and he said they absolutely deserve to get hippies if they drink someone's bath water
i mean yeah what do you what's the best you can hope to achieve from conceiving bath water of an
person i don't know what's your like what's your like best possible outcome they just get
the nice taste that they're after and they get a sense of catharsis in mentally and physically
a little bit of thirst quenching perhaps hello it wouldn't taste nice i probably wouldn't know
here's the thing can can so can something like herpes survive in water because there's no host
i think people did actually say that you can't get it like that or something i don't know
it's not you can't transfer that just through water contact otherwise everyone would have it
surely like swimming parasites parasites color or thing waterborne diseases sure if she's a very
dirty girl you could have those weird worms that crawl up here urethra so you drink the bath water
and then suddenly you've got a pain in your crank so piss worms yeah piss worms beautiful beautiful
piss worms from bell delphine that that's what you can put on your twitter and get validated by
everyone that's a good uh video title you get probably about a million yep and i would and i
would bring it back to super mario how super mario causes piss worms oh my goodness now you're gonna
make it sound more pomo mario why did you make piss worms the intrinsic value of mario piss worms
there you go gotta you gotta have the big words gotta have the big way sounds smart you gotta
ham up the the snooty fart huffer you know that's how you do it you can pull video i the amount of
times they've been tempted to set up a satire essay channel with really obvious piss taking
i've always it's it's ripe for for the taking there's so many of these pseudo intellectual
essayists it's a gold mine to exploit and and and you know don't mean to kiss your
ass here but thank fuck for efap to to pull the pull off the veil of these essayists and go
guys some of them are a bit pseudo intellectual we're offering a counterpoint because there's
not many counterpoints to these essayists everyone takes their word at face it's just their opinion
they can't be wrong if it's just their opinion i'm sorry we're just twisted shells of men yeah
i was gonna say that's what happens when we respond but hey we couldn't have done today without you
guys you guys are doing your good work as well stopping these people um the next one says high
rags wish me a happy birthday you massive it's from cody upperman cody upperman happy birthday
here you go cody yeah don't don't blow it go and do something fun and amazing and enjoy yourself
on your birthday yeah just i don't know take a nap man just have a good wank and tell yourself
you ain't gonna clean it up till morning just just sleep in and just let it get all crusty
all over yourself and make sure you say this is my favorite part this is my favorite part
you're so deader just goes dead as a this is my favorite part this is my favorite part
what if jesus was a commie how do we know that he wasn't if you subjectively drank bath water could
you objectively get herpes i think we just answered that in that entire discussion honestly
several times completely follow up question from that same person rags finger me until your brow
furrows you say what no no the first part but uh it's just one part really okay then the last part
rags finger me until your brow furrows
oh there's your answer right there that's an agreement normally that's not normally
that's not an action that would cause my brow to furrow um mola what are your thoughts on phase
four of the mcu unless i was trying to find your butt and i was like maybe squinting you know kind
of looking for it but generally it's an easy thing to find i'm not going to encourage about
phase four of the mcu the only movies i really want to see from all the ones that have been
announced is blade out of curiosity and doctor strange two because they said it would be a horror
and skull which is in it which interests me i don't really care about love and thunder
i don't really care about the tv shows i might give them a shot um and then that seems to be
about it phase four looks pretty dull so far uh i want to see guardians three there's got to be
some surprise announcements for phase four that they're like keeping because that that that
initial announcement lineup is pretty bare oh blade is phase five okay um fun hypothetical
how would you take the elements of wakanda put into a medieval setting have them be imperialists
and have them be an antagonist how would why i thought what the whole point of wakando is that
they were only imperialists at the beginning and then they stopped for no reason you know because
only white people would continue to conquer things at least that's what everyone told me a lot
that sounds a lot like a comic series called green valley which started a few years ago
where there's a guy who travels back in time to like the medieval times um and they all think
that he's a wizard but he's actually just got like an ipad that can do cool shit but yeah
so how would you take the elements and put into an
medieval set i would probably make them really terrifying actually as a faction
remember that story we came up with there's like a just a ring of bones around their entire
the black walkers and every time someone sees like anyone has laughed at that which means he's
racist oh absolutely we're all racist here it's okay because um it means uh it means that you're
honest because everybody everything is racist everything you want to know why you just got to
point it out why do they do that because they're so deadly and terrifying people like don't even
see them so they just call them the black death because it's like the plague it just happens and
sweeps through it it kills it sounds like you're trying to justify racism right also they're from
africa an illustrator for the designing stuff for game of thrones fifth season morgue park is going
to be at hawaii con should what question should i ask if i get the chance that he was responsible
for designing what stuff for game of thrones fifth season um that's what he thinks of the
latest how it ends see what he says why couldn't he design a better script but he has no influence
on the script that poor yeah maybe should have should have burned it down hi all hope you'll
cover tonal soon been a while oh i'm sure we will we got plenty of uh absolutely got plenty of
things there's a couple things we've got to talk about at the end of when i get to the end of the
super chat it's like fun things ahead i talked about it on someone's stream but i haven't talked
about it the only drag that's acceptable is behind a truck that's mean i just wait i was
just watching the jack eric stream no drag air drag like air resistance you get the drag i thought
they were talking about dragging bodies no no no not dragging uh i was just watching the jack eric
stream in response to efap so much pain but anyway guys they did it okay the way that they
did it rhino milk on me i'm glad they had fun and i'm hoping i hope their audience had fun as well
they sound like a bunch of dirt bags they sound like shells of men yeah husks hello guys i'm very
glad to see snacks and pikemen back on i unfortunately won't be able to catch efap live
anymore because of my new job but i'll still try and get a super chat in whenever i can no
problemo mr chip chivalry chip to bed just quit just check them out when they re-upload it'll all
still be there this is for rags thanks rags wish you're welcome yeah i don't know what the thanks
was for but yeah yeah i don't either um i'll be back from salad king all right
two episodes ago i misspelled parrick willams on sc and you pronounced it ever since then i've
had night terrors panic attacks and have relapsed into my gambling addiction i feel dead inside
also hi rags hello hi movie enjoy your panic attacks movie binge update brave heart great
but suffers heavily from one of the worst written romances i think i've seen in cinema
wow both were so rushed oh yeah i know that's just that's just scottish romance scottish
medieval romance they just didn't know how to do it back then didn't know how uh when will you
guys do another efap gaming there's no real limit on it or expectation we just sort of jump in but
there is one we've sort of been planning so again not like probably not within the next
few weeks because we've got plans for stuff but yeah it's not something we don't want to do we
do want to do all right what's in the talks of of uh efap and great british podcasts we we do a
gaming session or something left for dead or something like that i think that would work if
there's six of us well it's got the the versus mode so we can get a couple of guests i think rags
hates versus mode we were gonna do i mean i'll play it for the set i'll play it for efap um hey
the other problem is that versus mode doesn't work unless we actually split into teams like
you know the idea that we can't plan anything if we're literally talking to the people who are
trying to plan things against i no no that's that's the fun part i think you think play rocket league
yeah i think rocket league would be better if everyone had that yeah we can do that
i haven't played it but i think i've got it that you know what that could work i also want to do
like an actual just you know we all respond to a video the six of us i think that'll be cool
a big shouting match basically you would have to be tonaled we'd have to save it
we've got plenty of total to work with so yes uh mauler just started playing re4 any tips
um not really re4 is very uh very rewarding to just playing in lots of different styles so
you should be fine uh just be careful i would recommend playing on harder difficulties to
increase the potential scare factor but if you just want to play the way you want to play go for it
i love reading who wants to play resident evil four apparently he's just started it he's saying
any tips um honestly it's kind of just go through it as you go through it just look for stuff look
at goodies keep looking around yeah look around um but you'll learn as you go it is one of my
favorite games of all time i own it for four different systems i probably could
draw out every single level in that game in my head i've played it so many times
uh me mento update bpm adoption question bpm in fact i need to install resident evil for it
do you want me to ask did i mean i'm pretty sure cynic snacks was on the adult of the stream we
talked all about it so i'm not uh sure who you're speaking to directly maybe uh you know voxx do you
think orphans deserve love
that's a no he's saying silent out of respect because he's an orphan too but he knows the truth
disney starwalls is the adaptation though source material is the original trilogy
you could say that but that doesn't make it true it's the continuity hasn't changed you've got
everything is the same um at that point it's like talking about what is canon and what isn't
you can have head canon but the reality the only meaningful thing you can say about canon is just
who owns the ip and then claims what is canon it kind of sucks but everything else gets
is me um disney starwalls isn't an adaptation just the continuation um the sequel yeah yeah
it would be defined as a sequel while homecoming would not be a sequel to the comics
massives you need to watch jojo's bizarre adventure is so unique you'll never watch a show
like it plus each wait wait did you say jojo's bizarre bizarre adventure is that a motherfucking
jojo reference i think so yeah each part has different characters and tones you'll find a part
you like oh yeah any efap can be 24 hours if we super chat enough technically well i can only stay
for another maybe hour and a half i think we should be done in around an hour at most that
would be my guess oh boy um oh boy hey wolf have you seen the two conno suba ovas they're good but
when it's so loose i will i will just copy this uh save it for the next if wolf is in the chat
then this is a super chat towards the chat to someone in the chat i get it i don't think he
is though that man is working his everything's yeah i guess how can i hate how can i hate fuck
rags when i'm not gay but he's so lovable asking for a friend um maybe it's not the gay part it's
the hating part you'd have to one get yourself in a position where well um you would have to be gay
or or just bite the bullet for a bit uh then you'll learn to like it but you'd also have
to find a way to hate me which many have found a way to do but often for terrible reasons and
you don't want to do that if you want it to really be a hate fuck then you have to hate me for
like a real reason you know uh you guys should invite arch warhammer on efap i believe he is uh
he's actually on board right yeah yeah yeah yeah it'll happen eventually oh yeah you bet please
help my siblings actually like the last jedi what should i do disown them forcefully reeducate
them or just have them humanely destroyed uh the latter i mean tell them you know
you don't have to be humane though it's all right they'll get over it one day it's okay
they'll recover it's like a it's actually kind of like leprosy you think there's just
things keep falling off but someday someone cured it that's you know that analogy works perfectly
now show me on the map where the bad man touched you
join efap hear dawn being man-loved thumbs up i mean he is the dawn blessed be the
pikeman also high rags hello captain peace and tuberculosis upon you oh no
captain marvel touches stanley's mole rat screenplay i know and he could have killed
it it would have been law lawfully legally lawful yep he didn't because he's a nice man
he had all the rights to it's like palestinian slingshots a rock israel drops cluster bombs in
retaliation yeah but it's as long as it's justified legally which we really we can trust legal legal
right guys i can he seems like a stupid guy he's a stand-up gentleman uh thanks for entertaining
me on my 14-hour car drive oh no this efap won't be long enough for 14 hours
wait we'll be able to put out one that's going to be longer eventually lollipop man bad
uh efap on trousers wait efap on trousers off milk rhino spiders mystic yep it's toxic time
i can imagine cheerleaders doing that before the big game
the efap game that'll be the they'll cheerlead us against uh great british podcast
it's gonna be so awkward because i'll be betraying my british brethren but i have to i have no choice
i have no choice traitor and the colonies are pretty cool guys check them out
i'm molar rags pizza man and blessed pipeman hello the band is back today oh good for you
costume department i'm not even sure what that's right
the real hero of shazam is that stupid news report yes uh so i mean do you guys care about
shazam spoilers no so far away so as you probably are aware he's like a kid and when he says shazam
he turns into the adult superhero man who's like super invincible and awesome and everything
then when he says shazam again he turns into the very vulnerable kid um so the villain's chasing
him and villain's like doing a pretty good job beating the shit out of him and um he gets like
spooked and so he goes shazam in the middle of the fight and runs off so like the villain doesn't
know where he is because obviously he doesn't know he's like oh a kid what the fuck and he walks up
he's just walking around like looking for him and then there's this news report that's playing this
clip from earlier where shazam his adult form was talking to a friend of his who knows him as the
younger one calling him by his like name i think his name is billy i don't remember and then the
villain looks at that report like hmm that kid clearly knows who shazam is in kid form and then
he literally just pans to the left and that same kid is standing there going hey billy where are
you billy billy the villain is like and grabs him and yeah it's like the only thing that allows the
villain to find the hero in the whole plot line it's like so bad when i was watching it because
watching last night all the night before i covered with um with metal we had drinks and fucking hell
we were laughing at that shit we were like one of the fucking odds that a news report plays
the exact thing he needs and then the kid in the news report turns up to the left of the news
saying the exact same thing it was funny uh shazam wasn't very good i'm afraid i had fun
with it but holy shit the writing was special when you um when you described it i thought it
was like supposed to be a joke in the movie no it was just really bad
uh very minor details like the ones that shazam directly mentioned don't matter as much as
contrivance his plot holes and character inconsistencies do yeah yeah agreed there
are two different things yeah uh why are rags and voxes so much better than everyone else
treat my prostate like a misbehaving ketchup bottle please hmm we'll slap that we'll slap
some discipline india um i told you i'd be back hi rags please hello i'm rags and i'm
bend this irresponsibly all right the tan you know it uh dear efap would you rather get a tattoo
of brie larson's face on your forearm or get a tramp stamp of quinton with his alternate facial
here find mr where oh yeah um hmm i can i would i'd probably marble on my forearm yeah yeah
because i don't want to have to explain to people when they pull down my pants
and they're staring at my ass i don't want to that's really not the ideal time to get into some
kind of a excuse i'd have to come up with as to why i have a picture of this strange ugly mongoloid
on the back on the top of my crack i would rather yeah well this is the captain baller
one you could just say like yeah i lost a bet but with the quinton one you'd be like okay
saying i lost a bet does not explain this enough i'm sorry this is just a disaster i mean i would
probably be able to come up with some non humiliating reason to have captain marvel's
face on my forearm and it could be like the back of the forearm or something like that
and then you could like add you could slowly but surely add all the other faces of the the
marvel superheroes to it until you had a like a collage of all the superheroes so it wouldn't
be a big deal if captain marvel was there because everyone was there um and then you could put like
gandalf on there and you know blade and all sorts of other stuff you know i mean he didn't say we
can't get it removed immediately after no i i think it's the spirit of the question i i know
but i like you have to know how to read you gotta poke the holes you gotta find them holes and poke
you do and when people poke my holes i don't want to fucking be staring at quinton's face
especially some of his uh his latest iterations oh man he look what an ugly person hey jesus christ
uh rags you gotta make a video wolf is tired young blood um i am going to do a review on it yes
probably my next review that i'll be out uh next week or so but now that my throat's a whole lot
better i can you know do those which is good man yeah young blood is kind of next on my list
i want to get that knocked out oh and by the way since we're talking about wolfenstein uh
the quake con sale on steam they got some pretty good stuff they got prey for like six bucks they've
got um the new order for like seven dollars the evil within twos 15 there's some good stuff in
there and if you haven't played if you haven't played oblivion yet you gotta you gotta play
oblivion it's legit amazing um two snacks from my ass um
ten dollars from salad king to to your ass i guess uh cynic snacks as much as you're muted i know
you appreciate that um and tosspot you can only have this if you tell us what your profession is
a professor-tism of a professor-tist of there you go what's the question what's the question
what are you a professor of uh i'm professor tosspot um what did you say professor of what
that's not wrong i'm professor tosspot that's that's that's all there is to it uh that's all
you need these this day and age isn't it all right fine no trust me i'll be in i'm in a fucking
video essay talking about psychology soon oh and people will you will be cited hmm and
found some way to shoehorn some post-modernist theory into some bollocks i don't know so on
the topic of how mario ruined game of thrones mario put the coffee cup on the table it'll make
sense now i mean it's just funny that that was that's such a minor issue like the the stupid
starbucks cup they actually made fun of it the carvacog cattle a cattle panel they had um
everybody had a coffee cup where they came out yeah hey rags did you know any salad can be a
caesar salad if you stab it enough ah i get that that's true that's very true don't forget to get
dan and dave on efap also i could be meeting tom hiddleston charlie cox and jake jillenhall soon
in new york city cool what for an orgy what was the context what what else would they be meeting
them for i have heard the rumors about tom hogg
tim laro that sounds like violence towards my people i'm not oh because he said salad king
i guess would be yeah if you stab salad king enough he'll turn into a caesar salad king
that makes sense it's true skittles made a giraffe milking commercial
what's wrong with rhinos hmm kind of racist but all right maula please tell oof oof why
the news report on the tv screen in the mall in shazam is contrived and stupid i think we covered
it if someone wanted to say that wasn't contrived i would that would be the most like that's why
when he explained it to me i thought it was supposed to be a joke and like the comedy movie
and they played off as a joke that oh you just happen to be right there
has any of you guys played gris if not use this to get it it's only about three hours
long which one of the best games of 2018 in my opinion also high rags hello um i've heard of
gris but i have not played it i have not here in america we have what is called grits and you can
kiss you heard of grits it's my grits that's a saying right uh no but if you told someone to
kiss your grits i don't know how they'd react certain baht says in simpson so it has to be
related to america somehow kiss my grits yes i'm okay it seems that one's never been wrong
about anything they predict the future regularly also high rags hello the mcu is the cooked bagel
of cinema yeah i think they proved that most modern tv shows are basically serialized movies
with episode lengths of 40 minutes or more well this is the thing he didn't consider a
lot of context to how media is being made these days but the fact that we still have contained
episodic tv shows alongside like really long narrative ones i don't know you can't really
crush all of these information into a 12-minute video trying to explain why endgame succeeded
well it wasn't really 12 minutes because they had the wicks ad
yeah it was more like nine i guess generous um did tonald ever end up making a video where he
yells uh i checked it out he doesn't yell but he gets more passionate than i think we've ever
seen him so we will become oh really yeah i told wolf about it and he was very excited um it's
about how fifa is starting to make more money from its microtransactions than the sales of its games
and so they're going to be putting more and more into it i guess and he's very upset because he
loves fifa oh yeah i can see no i i could see why that really would upset him yeah yeah it's
gonna be great yeah sucks to see things that you really care about i just kind of die like that
or at least get turned into something else angry slow and all yeah fuck sorry i'm late
wasn't notified because i left my house right when it started i guess it's okay what do you
think about the metal gear series i've never played it i've only played five and i really
liked it oh there you go we're the worst people to ask apparently well close to it anyway uh
because i know that people fucking adore that series and i'm like yeah i've missed out on it
completely uh when something needs to happen you get the predator you get a lot of stuff like
definitely one of them the pikeman has blessed the toxic brood very true rear bless i feel what
i feel blessed that name's never gonna leave me nice why would you want it to it's not a bad name
powerful name and you have a high standing in the law you could probably make some executive
decisions really you're all fired this is my show now uh could you look at those women um
i was probably referencing something in the video when movies wait what was it i don't know when
were there women in the video i wasn't paying attention maybe in the mobile ads there's some
women in there oh mate yeah yeah in the mobile ad looking at women this is my favorite part
when movies first came out people would sit and watch a person sitting in chairs for hours what
is this dude on um how does he explain something like empire strikes back with you know like the
narrative is not finished whatsoever and yet it was just one big middle yeah it's one big middle
i'm all i love your ea survey video also hi rags hello yeah i worked really hard on that ea survey
tough one fuck yeah pizza man bad oh also hi blessed pipeman and pizza man
hello pizza man is burbing right now he's currently consuming uh one of his brothers
recrusting oh i told you he's got a digestive system he's gonna eat something and then he's
gonna poop it out i'm so curious where the poop comes out watching captain marvel with
my parents at the dawn scene i felt a small tear at his struggle for which i was accused of
massiveness no yeah it's kind of hard to i don't know if i if i for whatever fucked up reason if i
watch that movie for another time i don't know how i'd be able to handle it i'd be an emotional
i'd leave the room at that scene i think out of out of in solidarity with don i'm surprised
they allow it like on screen like i don't know if there's a rating above r but you need to have it
call it the don rule uh missed you guys passed two while they were live so here's a bunch more
for alcohol and wherever else is needed oh you have lots of alcohol in this program now it'll
make everything more coherent i swear i mean i listen to efap 24 hours a day pretty well oh
if taylor listens to efap 24 hours a day then that means efap is just one giant middle
no ending there's no beginning oh no if you go back like being in the middle if you go back to
episode one it sounds like it's not really the beginning it's just a continuation of like you
could watch them all out of order i know you wouldn't be able to tell the difference hmm no
progression no learning it's all a medal here's 20 more for recuperation costs oh i remember that
meme uh that means mauler never stopped writing star wars critiques he merely pauses endless man
bad also hi mum who's who's the man bad yeah that'll be the doobie if people say like mauler
never finishes a point endless man bad well they'll find something except when when our guys say
it's like a meme but to other people who hate us it's like their legit way of saying that we're
bad with with with shells of men laughing at patrick willow uh i love that we're at nightmare
for those people because i put out a tweet uh that just said like i i enjoy the the creature
they've created on that subreddit the the villain that is mauler and how horribly efap is just like
what is this craziness like this thing closely resembles whatsoever like oh this guy he seems
like a really bad dude i hope i don't run into him in a dark galley have you ever been tempted
to hop on to it and say behold we are we are your arch nemesis bow before us you shits uh so i think
they'd they'd be like you know we will fight you we will call the police we'll stop you you're
you're destroying film criticism why didn't you just mess with their minds and say well there's
a reason i always wear a mask and that's because i am patrick williams and this has just been a
massive ruse wait it's pretty cool to have that power though so like we've you do no one's no one's
in your face except for a select few i don't want to see it um am i real am i just a meme that came
to be this is from the profile fred the cosmic chicken i think we just came to understand you
yeah you were always there you're always there we sort of only recently saw a light
uh lalon versus the dawn does lalon really stand a chance i don't know i don't know if that's fair
you need like all you need the entire efap rose gallery against the dawn i would say
uh richard a's asshole aka alan subplots don't exist nope there's no there's only one big plot
that's it the alan is the anti-dawn wait is it alan alan or alan chat i can't remember how
they spelt it in the video but just go with all three of them i think that's the sorry
uh swarming some water i think it's the pretentious way of saying
orland yeah now i'm sure he has a ponzi we're seeing avengers mid game
i mean end game isn't in the end they've got another film already it's not over
not everyone died the universe didn't get destroyed so it's not over never over uh me grog
like boobies in metal chair story yeah that's what it used to be man but then but then we regressed
again into primordial booze that worked repeating alan reminds me of jp3's talking raptor
and someone made a meme for it yeah you're on the ball that's the link to super mario brothers you
skip the middle levels with the warp zones he's not obvious with a lot of the meaning behind it
and we took that for granted this alan guy sounds like a massive bundle of sticks speaking of which
hi rags good to have you back hello efap just isn't the same and you're not a special guest
it's true you were gone you were gone for seven thousand episodes that's crazy luckily there's
thirteen thousand six hundred episodes of efap and we recorded two thousand today at least so
not bad uh this is pretty good this alan guy all ends all beginnings and ends no middles no middles
we don't like the middles around here um grug thinks alan sound like filthy wood lover does
not get grug's boulder is best yeah alan doesn't understand a lot about boulders you'd probably say
that you shouldn't um couldn't criticize boulders as well like you know even prehistoric art
it's a tough life to live as alan gonna commit to those principles everyone wants a million
terminators predators and alien movies i know and it's horrible and they should all be murdered
unless they're good films in which case yes bring more but we have not a good alien predator or
terminator in oh i'm not even sure which one was the last good one type line alien predator
terminator all sucked since the second iteration of all of them i mean was salvation that bad
no but i still don't like it it fucked with the timeline a lot um and i didn't like this weird
human robot hybrid thing they did and i don't know i don't love it i don't hate it as much as
the others though um because i'm trying to just sort of trying to think because i mean avp was
terrible but almost in like a meme way i can enjoy avp yeah oh yeah i could probably watch
that again and just laugh my ass off that would probably be a good e-fat movies
please two parents give baby up for adoption years later they adopt a child if they don't
realize it was the same child could they still love it oh wow this is like the track question
in a way i think they would be told by a cosmic element perhaps a chicken that it is their adopted
child they need to know like the universe can't allow that to happen hmm it's very interesting
massive is in the middle i love hitchhiker's guide to the middle middle school was a big turning
point in alice light yes kill bill three or star trek tarantino plus jj did fine you asking
which do i want to see or which do anyone want to see i don't really i don't kill bill needs a third
and i don't really care about star trek so tarantino doing one doesn't even sound like it
would make a lot of sense but i'll watch both of them because i like tarantino stuff yeah
all right probably get some good tense negotiation scenes and then loads of blood splattering gun
firing action yeah phasers just cutting people into pieces and zapping people and vaporizing them
yeah and i love the use the n-word as well oh yes hey star tricky a healthy amount this time able
to super chat you know the bridge in yaga this time able to super chat but if it's not too much
trouble i'd like your thoughts on my tweet at you re game of thrones season eight twitter handle
hey that's a strange one i'll see if i can find it quickly
um i don't know when or where to send this
curious what you think feel free to discuss it also we want to been pondering about something
i've never heard two things uh there are two things presented as very significant factors
for denarius in regards to her taking king's landing the first is her losing her second dragon
i can't really remember much how much losing the first dragon is discussed as a relevant tactical
loss but it's probably major too the iron fleet killing a second dragon is definitely presented
as a huge scale tipping against her though second thing is the men of the north joining
her army the scene of her demanding sansa keep her word and the sending her men makes it seem like
they're an integral part of the invasion after we see that danny takes the city with virtually no
losses having only one dragon almost completely by herself every scene even discussing her tactical
preparation for the invasion feels incredibly hollow yeah you could have uh taken king's landing
with more ease if she had done it at the end of season six when they're all heading over she
could have just jumped over with drogon because they didn't even have scorpions at that point
so she could have annihilated it with even more ease and it really makes a lot of the middle
feel worthless but what do i owe you yeah hopefully that yeah i agree i love the middle
of lesbian nun movie lesbian nuns movie oh it sounds like a porno i think that was me talking
about uh adam kurtis and one of the documentary girls on this weird tangent about so yeah all right
uh middle no the story doesn't end here this the end is just another middle one we must all wear
un unashed togas to unash to un un sashton allen the white
sonald allen loke is the superior commentator me toga stinks me toga stinks
his pubes are what we've are what we've to see the future what oh that's from fred the koswick
chicken okay uh is the middle our great god speaks in such deep metaphors
yes is the middle just a concept like goliath is it the thing that spawned goliath is the middle
the true enemy of the koswick chicken i need ads i think cynic would let you know that um or sorry
not cynic um yeah yeah cynic snacks yeah i think he'd tell you that uh koliath is not just better
for he's very very real very real however the middle might be metaphorical we will we're yet
to see that yes steve uh he's not completely wrong about the final conclusion of endgame
have you see what coming after endgame he's not completely wrong about the final conclusion of
endgame have you see what coming after endgame don't understand he's asking us are you aware of
what's coming up after endgame so he's not really that wrong well i mean did anyone think
it was going to end with endgame no uh yay my two favorite podcasts together mostly fantastic
looking forward to listening later blessed be the pikeman etc etc you just gotta get everybody
death is not the end only the middle agreed oh no i touched the sims one time does that mean
i'm doomed to an eternity in purgatory well you you've permanently paused yourself playing it
but the thing is you didn't even have to play it to get to that point before you played it
it was on pause how it works wisecrack is like the child of movie bob and tonals um
i don't see how movie bob is in there really because movie bob's kind of a psychopath wisecrack
didn't seem to be a psychopath but we'll maybe maybe other videos he's a typical bad video it's
not like he wants to murder people the ba there is the shortened version of blake allen i can
officially confirm as an allen the goliath exists in the middle of bagels oh that makes a lot more
sense now this video amounts to me hi me see nothing but middle everywhere it's a combo yeah
wolf last efap me hi cheek said me hi yeah he was very high last
um the song whoever gets you through your efap the song of ice and fire will never end because
george our mine will never finish it so you're telling me it's all middle is that what you're
saying jesus star wall fandom end when disney kill it so it's all right um someone might buy
it off disney like you never know and then it just goes on again forever so it sounds like he talking
about heroin when he was talking about getting addicted to stuff does it happen a bad effect on
you it applies to a lot of things humans do honestly the never-ending story smoking yes
alcoholism self-abuse the never-ending story ended that's true you'd think that would be the
one that wouldn't end wouldn't you that that would be the sort of placeholder for like how
stories don't end you'd be like that'd be the one we'll make sure but nope even that one ended
meme our love because they end
why is he showing jojo about things ending it's on part eight and still going started 1987 and
still going i think he actually referenced it as something that wasn't ending but i'd have to
check the uh editing again just because game of thrones had a story that could have gone on
forever doesn't mean that it was impossible to end it well it wasn't an easy task but to satisfy
most people they only needed to come up with something that made sense people have unironically
said it would be a better ending if they cut it off at the end of season six just let your
imagination run as to what would have happened post that moment instead of showing us what they
did so yes i agree remember that awful series with no middle that one called chenobyl um the whole
thing was a middle i love that nobody still exists you're noble i watched it all that night
i just went through all the episodes i love it i pitched it that i was like i'll show you just
one episode all right you're like oh you're okay no two no three no no the rest and i just went
through the whole damn thing good shit uh did trump build the camp i'm not sure what this
referencing relation to maybe it was the camp from the walking dead game oh i mean if you use
a life during zombie apocalypse maybe uh does this game even exist on the app store is a good
chance it's already stopped like being so unpopular like i don't know uh great to see you on here
again pikeman and snacks you two stay classy you stay awesome too molar and rag slice and dice
do my best ever ever actually being classy oh you you're pretty classy pizzas are typically
very classy like high class people eat i'm just getting some high end shit right there doing some
soup eating any ordinary food that can string two z's consecutively
uh play my favorite pod slowed old boat we could have done that actually playing that in slow
slow the cosmic chicken will redeem us maybe at the end but according to this guy everything's
a middle so will we even make it there i don't know um i think insults the human race has dethroned
toxic brood i don't know that anything can dethroned toxic brood i don't know toxic brood is like all
of us beautiful like you out there you're part of the toxic brood you're with us second you
guest on here and agree with anything we say in any way shape or form or even talk to us you're
part of the toxic brood yeah i kind of feel that way about being an insult to the human race like
i've only really interacted with twice if you interact with us twice you are an insult to the
human race as well that's just how it goes well i apparently don't even have to interact with
people at all to be like their buds so they're god of scott free i'm just a blessed pipe he's got
the word blessed in his name these guys didn't appreciate my defending of you people as human
beings so they banned me for being a sad dude and so the guys on that subreddit banned meme repository
they did yep they sound like fun well this is the thing don't disagree with them
for an opinion yeah you have to agree that we're all the worst pieces of humanity otherwise
you're a bad person these are these are people who pride themselves on their ability to be critics
they they've said about us that we can't take criticism it's kind of like i don't know
like you want to go on our podcast and talk about it oh that would be fun
i mean in terms of taking criticism we uh read it we read out the criticism live well
they were just they were just insults they were rigorous Angela Merkel illegal opinions meme
oh we'll get there one day i'm one of the massives that have yet to see the avengers end games
spoilers don't affect me though because i'll watch it in some years when no one cares also
we all know why rags his throat was sore anywho time to catch up why was it sore i'm actually
kind of curious how my throat did get sore um i guess he knows and he must have erased your
memory so you would never know oh my goodness oh my god hey maulrus rag pipeman and pizza face man
love you all there's a special place in in the middle for wolf in my middle beautiful rag shag
mary kill long man blessed pipe man or dick cheese pizza man uh kiddo dick cheese pizza man
oh god damn it uh fuck long man and mary pipeman oh it's a beautiful ending for everyone except
dick cheese man well that happened to somebody i always get killed yeah i always get killed
these scenarios debate maybe it was the framing of you as dick cheese pizza man i probably threw
you off yeah baby doesn't sound very appealing does it um debate rhino milk or herpes bath water
oh god for what for what exactly what determines the winner i don't know are you trying to contract
happy yeah if you're trying to contract herpes then the herpes water might win out unless the
rhino had herpes and even then i don't know if you can contract herpes but then if it's just
you know which is just better overall it's like i'll take the rhino milk it's got well regenerative
powers nutrients disease i believe it cures all diseases doesn't it
well the chinese keep chopping off their horns for some reason there must be something good in
there apparently they turn them into dick pills so maybe if you drink rhino milk you'll you'll have
a dick like a rhino i don't know there you go do rhinos have big dicks i imagine they would because
they're big i'm gonna go ahead and say maybe milk's gotta come somewhere like horses or something
right um you should end this stream by reacting to the cats trailer who here hasn't seen the cats
trailer no no no i mean i've already seen it so it's like you know i have nothing i have no
investment in cats i had no say in the production of cats i didn't create it i didn't make it i have
nothing going on with cats personally but when i watched the trailer i felt embarrassed for watching
it i saw it and i thought what has science done yeah i had cringy face the whole thing i kind of
had like the exact opposite to that in that i couldn't give a single shit about the musical
story like i don't really know anything about it care but the fact that it looks so horrible
kind of made me interested yeah well it's this uncanny sort of like it's not like a like a
zootopia sort of thing where the animals are more like animals but they're cartoony and they're
they got that disney sort of style and they can express and emote and they could be really cutesy
and all sorts of stuff these are just this weird uncanny valley sort of are they people are they
like weird animals oh they creep me out why do they have tits with fur on them it looks like
kind of like a weird fever dream like you've cut some horrible disease and everything's just
oh fucking hell yeah it's like cat people they should be wearing i feel like they should be
wearing clothes and if you gave them little outfits with bows and vests and things that
would be so much better but fucking hell they i they should be they should be wearing clothes
it's very inappropriate for them to walk around it's freaky i could i could definitely see it being
in like a top 10 films to watch win your stone bag 420.com or something it's it's unintentionally
they'll win they'll win a 420 award next year Derek Savage get a raspberry that's for sure
wait have you guys seen that award no i haven't oh my days you know you know Derek Savage yeah
cool cats he started his own award award body basically uh he won biggest award ceremony in
america um and he basically hired some like comedy club for the evening and everyone had
turned up i presume was just expecting a night of stand-up comedy but he turned into his own
award show for movies and he had like a juggler i mean a magician uh like loads of just like crap
entertainers come on oh my god really he presented awards to like avengers and like a bunch of major
like hollywood movies and just had random people come up and accept the awards on behalf of the
companies and then he awarded himself best picture for his cool cat movie it's like
it's a it's a real mess but it's it's kind of funny it like a nice like a nice car crash
what's interesting too is that cool cats are such a basic bitch for a sona yeah
but yeah uh if i was just gonna say if people wanted us to react to it you
you basically got our coverage of it right there the cats thing
so you don't need to see us watch that trailer and then i gotta worry about copyright too
and it's just this whole yeah but who would claim who would claim responsibility for that
the people who think it'll make money oh actually i don't even know if it will who i don't i don't
even want to guess it's horrible uh if the sonic movie will will cream cats oh the sonic movie's
going to kill it like so many people are going to go turn out to see that for just out of morbid
curiosity um if someone had the power to regenerate a lost limb will that limb that was last
regenerate a clone of the person no i don't think that's how it works i think it's whatever it's
like attached to the brain or the torso maybe it's like it's going to be the brain or the heart
right that's probably what the fiction would do and then you're like what if you half the brain
or the heart and what happens well then you're dead yeah you just die because it's easy to die
hello rags
hello hi if someone kneels in front of you with their mouth open do they deserve to end up with
a sticky face asking for a friend well if someone kneels in front of me
then like height wise the way this work i get what you're asking no no because listen you just
assume you're assuming things because you need to get your mind out of the gutter you could be down
there for all kinds of reasons such as such as i mean there's there's so there's so many it's hard
to choose just one you know because there's so many reasons um sound like a wise crack it's like
name a constellation it's like oh i know so many i just it's hard for me to just say one you know
because i i like them all so much and there's so many of them that i enjoy uh but yeah hi uh
thanks for the super chat you bet i mean i could have named one all right uh fine or ryan
oh i'm i swear that's the one that everybody knows fine scorpio cancer which is this chat
that's racetisms uh
okay uh where is the gray doggy you will be back on the following yep it's out of the fear
i just want to give rags my two cents i guess mola can have the rest
oh that's funny because because you know i'm sorry mola i put a very important straw poll in
your server on the efap channel so this this straw poll is who is the big gay and the options
are out of us four so do you guys think i should encourage such a poll or is that toxic to the
toxic brood i think that's fine there's nothing wrong about asking people who they think the big
gay is they're not calling them the big gay all right where is the poll i have posted it now in
the chat i'm spamming it and this guy mauler he's spamming the chat the vote on who you guys believe
to be the big gay i am going to have to for ethics reasons excuse myself from voting in this poll
i am completely objective i was able to vote on the correct answer
oh wow who'd you vote for well i can't reveal that because it would tell everybody who the
correct answer is instead of letting us know what everyone thinks the correct answer is
yeah i suppose so oh this poll is lighting up oh dear rags oh dear rags rags oh really oh dear
i'm actually upset that i didn't get more votes oh you got plenty of votes in your second place
there's still plenty of time how does the big cheese pizza only gets six percent
maybe maybe they they need to have the topping specified what are the biggest gayest toppings you
can think of pineapple pineapples are pretty gay topping yeah sausage is pretty gay sausage and
pineapple why pineapple because it makes your cum taste better yeah i didn't even think of that
did you stick with that mushrooms very cooking nah mushrooms are cool i'm interested to know
i always buy mushrooms it's one of my the i never forget to buy mushrooms when i go to the store
the interesting part is pole with anything is seeing yeah you really can you put just steak
and other veggies and anything and with eggs fucking anything people are bringing up how i've
how i read uh gay donut fiction oh yeah it's in the canon true yeah that doesn't mean that you
endorse it though uh i'm i do you fall gay donut right uh you know if you remember the
story it was all about how gay donuts were persecuted and if there are any gay donuts
watching this you have nothing to hide you know be yourself sprinkle yourself across the world
um you you will not see any harm from us we we endorse your lifestyle as a donut as a gay donut
so yes and there you go we are not toxic bad people so for those of you on reddit or whatever
the bad mouthing these people we endorse gay donut rights i don't see any other
progressives doing that do you exactly um i like the foxes has one more vote over cynics next

life it's okay there'll be another one it's fine this is for wolf by the way i just got into red
letter media god bless don wilson and his wildlife preserve in iowa yeah i love red letter media
john wilson they might i've got a couple i guess but they're one of my favorite channels right now
just because there's nothing else like red letter media on youtube i i re-watch their stuff all the
time i go to their best of the worst and i just i can re-watch those i don't actually care if they
talk about films critically i just enjoy watching them hang out because they're like the most bizarre
people ever but also hilarious they've really meld together well they just bounce off each
other so much and they're just funny and they could just keep it going anything with rich evans
as well is just massively improved i chose that word specifically yeah because you mean to a large
extent i'm saving up money for switches for cj and tosspot don't worry mola oh has he already
got one for you cynic snacks i already i'm in possession of one ah james is gonna get all of
us to have them and then we can oh dude we can all play super shmasse brothers and then it'll be me

bought a switch for me wolf and rags yeah he's kind of crazy he's actually a little nuts i'm
part of he's worried about him oh he's a lovely man um just he's he's a sugar daddy for a lot of
people on a completely unrelated note i'm building a new pc there you go james
wink wink nudge nudge you know it's hard getting parts and money for it yeah so if anyone wants to help

medici family i still think he's a saudi prince yeah they have lots of money speaking of a versus
mode vermintide 2 is getting one when i don't know it's true yeah so high rags i think it's
coming out with the winds of magic expansion which i'm extremely excited for i love vermintide 2
it's one of my favorite games gel man of the toxic brood gel men yeah we are all kind of just
shells once we did that first stream on patrick williams or third stream i don't remember which
one it was uh we sort of just gave up on life we became shells pretty sad but people enjoy
watching us shells so it's weird that hanging out with your friends and discussing your opinions
and trying to come up with better systems to criticize things throwing around jokes and
hanging out with people who will support you it's amazing how much that makes you an empty shell of
a human being if only we knew how to live fulfilling internet lives and not be an insult
to the human race yeah that was i'm not even human so i mean anybody watches this is an extension of
that an insult to the star wars fandom near two thousand yeah that's the worst we've got near two
thousand insults to the human race watching us like jesus that's fucked up guys we should all
be erased a bunch of all right nazis yep i don't know why people dislike the sopranos ending so
much i think it's great uh-huh i get it he cut out cut to black i get it uh stream snipe sargon
stinky wang is he streaming yeah i guess he's i guess he's streaming now yeah streaming while
efap is on what is he thinking the knife what a beard mean uh loads meme cannon by rags oh no
oh no um anime captain marvel is better than mcu marvel that's probably true everything is better
than mcu marvel yeah hey rags can you sing akbar's theme for us again please love you guys can i
sing can i sing akbar's theme yes there's actually a pretty funny meme video that will
be shown soon enough uh i don't know if you remember what you said tentatively then yes
i will you remember what you said akbar's theme um ocean man oh yes uh gaza yeets rockets so israel
yeets hellfire missiles israel can't help it if gaza sucks at fighting palestinians are uh
the bathwater of the midwest mid east you should have said middle east i wouldn't put a palestinian
in my mouth microtransactions will lead to games only focusing on the middle so they'll never end
alan was right of course he was right uh watching he was trying to save us all along we should have
listened you should have listened he was the hero we didn't deserve watching jack saint say that
your fans don't watch his entire videos and imply that he is taken out of context is the funniest
shit as of late yes it's great um and the fact that reddit said he made videos that are too long
i was just like oh my gosh we're in the best timeline for some stuff i'm telling you man
you made your bed you gotta lay in it now did simpsons prediction the future or brainwash
people into creating the future oh they predicted trump would be president in like the 90s or whatever
did they make that happen do you think or did they predict yeah but i wonder how many other
celebrities depicted as being a future president in cartoons i don't know what you mean like what is
just him okay yeah you can't we can't engage in the sharpshooters fallacy i'm coming for that
booty efap oh no mr rag do you know if slash where i can catch up on arches nazi zombie dnd
campaign and what it's called on arch warhammer's channel is it as simple as that or is he that got
him unlisted yeah it's on the oh yeah oh yeah it's on his channel and so far we stream it on
wednesdays so they'll the episode should be there uh also take this money you deserve it you good boy
oh oh thank you can we have scallogram or metatron as a guest don't know either of them
i'd be totally down for having scallogram on um i haven't really watched metatron that much
all right there you go um they played us like a damn middle hey snacks i don't know if you have
seven one one in the uk it's a store people buy snacks from they stole your idea of a living
snacks and they now sell living snack plush dolls i think of you every time i see the pizza boy
what no fucking way buy one and send us a picture yes and where do you live
you said that uh it was silo 101 just just at cynic snacks on twitter with that same comment silo
and then you guys can figure out getting some pictures and see this plagiarism um i just
realized that in the mcu where is earth in midgard dun dun dun the middle oh no
been re-watching old efaps why is quinton such a dickhead well i don't actually know like i think
he's he's sort of a case study yeah very fascinating one i like that it was you could actually argue
that his our response to him is the first event in a series of events that just made him crash and
burn not that we caused it just that that seems to be the way it goes because the trump thing
happens soon after that right and then after that lots of other things and and yeah he's just um
more it would appear that that chat is really angry at you for not realizing that the shop
is called 7-eleven oh i said 7-1-1 right yeah oh no oh my god you weren't referring to 7-eleven
right i thought that was a actual thing over there we don't have 7-elevens oh my goodness
mauler no we don't have them here it's 7-eleven i read numbers as numbers what am i supposed to do
well from from this day forth it shall be known as 7-1-1 the 7-1-1 you guys in the chat need to
change your fucking tone rags it reminds me of um shit you show me with gold mcdonald or
everywhere he refers to 9-1-1 is 9-eleven the like the phone number 9-1 he's like 9-11 was a national
or reminds me of that tragedy
no mcdonald is a national treasure um
but anyways guys go to work now have fun destroying whatever massive garbage you're
covering oh we did oh you bet why does rags diss the drunken peasants ben's cool
yeah ben's a cool guy
do you want to answer the first part of the question or
oh he said why did you diss the drunken peasants
oh because we were on their show and i i will poke fun of the peasants we had fun on their show
though yeah they've had fun just the way like their ads and stuff are structured is really
odd almost like it's a radio show in a weird way i think ben is very much inspired by radio shows
actually he said this we're uh we're spending a lot of his younger life so he's inspired to make
his own show like that and then video is like a bonus thing and there's there's this definitely
influenced the drunken peasants in efap funnily enough and we've had a lot of um bleed over like
a lot of people say they watch both shows and i'll just we don't cover politics that much
or that many quote unquote crazy people but i mean there's an argument to be made for movie
bob i mean they're not like crazy i mean if you actually kind of listen to them they're sort of
insane but not like they're like high functioning crazy people yeah it's a wonderful little thing
you know what does fried cosmic chicken taste like no one's ever eaten cosmic chicken i was
gonna say that's pretty difficult if there was an instance of that occurring i think we'd be aware
of it yeah seems to be a catastrophic event um the audio from this video will serve the goliath
saga well speaking of everyone say sea goliath please sea goliath please sea goliath sea goliath
sea goliath there you go he probably wants that from a meme video oh oh wait oh he meant like
sea goliath not sea goliath please so i should say sea goliath sound like it's like a goliath
yeah like a like an instant like you could have a lava goliath and a sea goliath yeah yeah it's
gonna be okay we'll do it king of the monsters okay we'll do a dramatic take shall we
uh what like you want to do a dramatic go for it sea goliath
once more with feeling go for it wait who's going i've already done mine oh sea goliath
sea goliath
okay okay uh can we hear pounded by the pound oh that's that's a chutch tingle no um i guess
pounded by the pound yes there's pounded in the butt by my own butt and there's also it's called
pounded by the pound pounded by the pound the pounded by the social economic uh something
changes of uh england leaving the european union it's actually got a longer title but it's
a chucking uh chuck tingle story about someone being that's a different guy
being uh pounded by a pound coin but uh if you want some chuck tingle read on your podcast i
don't know if there's any time but i do have some of these stories in my library is rags familiar
with chuck tingle i think uh yeah you you didn't you read out some of his book titles in one of
your early podcasts yes uh we i read the gay comments yeah uh mauler when he was on the great
british book podcast he got subjected to some of chuck tingles i think it was the sentient
gay plane that jerks off on someone and they get covered in cum and also the plane is actually a
card player as well a really good poker player oh there's loads of fucking weird stories right
themselves the chuck tingle cinematic universe sounds pretty impressive uh but yeah i don't know
if people want want a reading to them it's up to you uh you guys should check out the 1996 movie
island of dr morrow it's a beautiful mess of a movie val kilmer is a big doo doo and maul and
brando is fun i think i'm familiar with that i've heard of this movie i feel like redler
medium might have mentioned it not actually covered it somebody's mentioned it and talked
about it so remember oh wow i'm just looking at some screenshots here kind of like if planet
the apes made with the with no budget yeah it was that time in alien brando's career when he was
going off and he's insane and he kept making weird demands of the director and pissing off
the director who is he got very loopy he's in superman he's in one of the super movies he plays
um superman's dad and he was absolutely fucking nutty kept winding up the director saying uh i
want to play this role like i'm a cabbage and the director just says to him just just play the fucking
no he he he was insane absolutely he just wanted to be a vegetable that's all he wanted
i i don't know man i don't think you should take that away from anybody you know i think that
that's important and i think people want to identify as a vegetable who are we to say no
who are we to say no uh rags you look good today did you change your hair no yeah i did i um
um no i didn't it's the same i that's the thing because you just sort of let it do what it does
that's why that's the it's my secret i just let it do what it needs to do and it's never let me down
people don't think it'd be like it does but i do also molar if you got the star trek reading order
i sent you because it's sure to read the addendum at the end as i forgot tng season six and seven
oh me and me and mel if we watch star trek if uh we're just gonna watch it in chronological order
like everyone else people recommended a viewing order for um uh clone wars and me and fortier
we're just like we're just watching chronological order don't worry we'll survive it'll be fine
it'll be fine um me high shakes me high me high shakes me high they paid two dollars to say that
wow that was two dollars well spent true glad to see hi shakes me high foundation glad to see my
response to steve went over your heads i was answering the previous super chat with yes steve
one okay sorry i uh my brain melts when i when i try to connect all the pieces and put the jigsaw
pieces in the pieces of the jigsaw at the same time you know a lot of people accidentally
pronounce it jinx saw because they're really dumb when they're young wait for a jigsaw yeah
they pronounce it jinx saw like people in my school used to do it and the teachers always get
really frustrated it's not jinx jinx saw jinx saw really dumb uh what about like uh piscetti
that's and and the one that annoys david mitchell um being expresso oh yeah
i had an old boss who was really uh irritated about that and the one that i enjoy that annoys
rags annoys the fuck out of me as well the um i could i could i could care less
oh yeah yeah that because that one's not a mispronunciation that one's just wrong
i was just dumb it's just like why are you telling me that you could care less okay like so you care
um oh my sister used to say demons for the word demon demons but put a d before the s at the end
that's how my sister used to pronounce that for a long time yeah demon does yeah i even i have
trouble trying to say it there's like demons yeah that's like that you're just making your life
harder it took ages for to stop saying it was good shit um well for me at least game of thrones
ended at the end of season six as i told you a lot of people felt that way rags any good pc gaming
laptop recommendations um no not because there aren't any but because i'm not really familiar
with pc gaming laptops they're gonna be expensive because they're very you know purpose built for
being powerful but at the same time being very form fitting being very small and mobile
uh so expect to pay a lot but i'm sure there's some really capable ones out there
tonaled acknowledged the tonaled moniker on twitter i know it was wonder still catching up
no amount of donations will make me draw snacks anatomical features functions ever i was from
bayouin yeah we we wouldn't you know yeah bullshit you'll do it for free
i was gonna say that actually sounds like some bayouin bite water dude but apparently not
apparently not um maula shag mary kill rags wolf and yourself i guess i would kill myself
so i don't want me running around like yeah but you always check yourself no no then if you kill
yourself first you don't need to i would honestly just flip the coin on the last two i really don't
mind the results okay with either you would definitely shag me if i say that it's offensive
to paul wolf when you eventually may he knows what he knows what you would say oh yeah i would
just say disappointed in you if you didn't shag me and he would be very happy about the marriage so
all good yeah probably um this ginger just sat there and said nothing for absolutely 12 minutes
no wonder disney is erasing gingers from their movies god what a massive he said stuff it wasn't
great stuff ginger oh yeah yeah the guy yeah blessed pipeman indeed the cat's movie is going
to be a furry convention no are you guys should do your own annual award show called the fappies
the fappies i'm down with it that sounds like a pretty good idea i'm not sure how it would go but
yeah that sounds pretty cool i'm absolutely down for the fappies when would it be would it be like
what would what would the categories be the calendar year what would the categories be
like worst video essay of the year most challenging fab yeah most most massive
week yeah there'd all be video essay related probably like i don't know funniest video
worst written most entertaining i don't know best guest oh we couldn't do best guess because
that'll be mean wouldn't it but putting every other guest
could you imagine we're just like don't don't tell the guy saying that they're just the worst
hey i was actually they'd get a fappy for it yeah yeah um i i think you should make actual
physical trophies as well and mail them no we'd make like a little piece of paper that just has
fappy and crayon on it you know they need to frame it if they didn't we'd be offended i've got lots
of um i've got lots of modeling clay i can make plasticine trophy make us a fappy you're just
trying to earn the best guest fappy aren't you uh i didn't know i was a contender i mean every
guest would be a contender well then i win then i guess you hear that toss pot did you hear that
shit and then i thought you'd fight for his honor but apparently not i suppose you've got a few that
can be uh put to a public like uh the biggest gay oh what would the cat how would we determine the
the you know category contentance contestants i guess you just go all the ones that you think
would be the biggest gay well just tell people to who say who they think the biggest gays are
and then take like the top five answers and then have those five be the contenders for
the biggest public vote yeah like a yeah like a public vote or it's up to us to come up with
some kind of a metric to judge both the gayness and the massiveness um i think the cats movie
comes out the same day as rise of skywalker i really hope we're in the timeline where cats will
beat star wars i don't think that'll happen but that would be fucking hilarious that would be
hilarious the boys dropped on amazon if you're down with superheroes like captain marvel getting
their shit kicked around by people like the dawn give it a watch i'm gonna consider it a lot of
people been talking about it if it's one season i can get it done quick um pineapple cum is my
favorite part oh it's a combo meme seven points for combo meme uh for the record the kneeling
question was assuming that as a doggo you would lick the face and you tell me to get my mind out
of the gutter tusk tusk don't act as if you're free of sin daddy loves his baby girl yes he does
seven one one more are you absolute massive i don't know what a 7-eleven even is still
is it a is it a supermarket gas like a costco like a corner shop convenience store
yeah so like a spa yeah a spa all right yeah where the hell did that come from you guys don't
have the it's just that's the uk's version of 7-eleven rags his brain has exploded he's thinking of
yeah that's just the name of the corner store gas station oh you mean like a spa it's called spa
what he would see i get ripped into for the 7-1-1 thing cheap snacks and gasoline acquisition
literally yes not even kidding some of them operate right next to gas stations or in them
a spa like just maybe we're confused as to what a spa i like the old people in chat who are
british know exactly what i'm talking about all the americans like what the fuck is he on about
a spa oh he's in his education this is fun uh cultural boundary why would a spa
fuck i'm so glad we threw that tea in the harbor man oh i mean it could have led you to great things
as well as tismi things like a spa yeah we burnt down the white house um yeah it was a show we built
a fucking better one that'll do him this shit oh you're gonna burn it down ourselves he did us
a favor you could go to the co-op indeed and the co-op sells uh funeral insurance stuff as well
they sell holidays yeah which is even more confusing sell holidays and funeral insurance
what are these like holidays to bangladesh or frickin mogadishu like oh the mortality rate
oh this holiday is only 40 percent it's great i can rewatch the efap lore vid on jared on loop
because of more or less hilarious wheezing a crayon gets me every time when is there a crayon
i don't remember that one i have to actually check it out i always just remember the skeleton
and the door those are those are the highlights snacks just met earth goliath oh so he hasn't
yeah you only met earth goliath snacks there's apparently a couple of them maybe there's four
elemental goliath and they'll join forces to make one goliath would be terrifying megazord
um like the power rangers first time catching efap live have some money also hi rags hello hello
hello by the way you're able to catch efap live yes by the way gametron show as a guest when um
i guess everybody can be a guest at some point the list goes on for million years some people
get bumped up just because they um they give us a super pack and that means that our policies
change based on that like cynics next year gave us um how much did you pay to be on today cynics
next i forget um two thousand shekels i think and voxxers you paid like 10 because we wanted you
here anyway right uh well yes that's and some of my not it was totally fair um get vic manana
and rakida law on efap my dudes i mean sure i don't know what we'd talk about with those two but
i mean i think only obvious get legally a lot oh love you guys mauler take a vacation so i can
catch up on past efaps and we got bad news for you sir in in the coming month um everyone loves
middle earth but no one cares about beginning earth or end earth also hi rags hello category
for the fappy best in your opinion best in your opinion that's good mr mauler do the 7-1-1's id
wakada stock rhino milk or do they only carry purple soy flour power swill um i would assume
that the powerful nutrients of rhino milk are not it's not something the wakandans have actually
accessed because it's well above their abilities something that really only efap viewers are aware
of so they wouldn't stock it no yes uh this is a question for any of you slash all of you what do
you think of the first matrix where do you think the trilogy went wrong no i haven't i honestly i
haven't seen the movies in so long the first matrix is great and the trilogy went wrong
when they decided to make a sequel the first movie the trilogy went wrong when it existed um
i adore the first one it was the second one so unnecessary it gets weird from the get-go
because it's like he fights three agents and it's like can't he just delete them and he's like
fighting them you're like well it undermines the first one which is like i'm free i'm god like
there are no rules that apply to me but i think because of the success one of us is like dude we
want more of the matrix do it bigger and better and then by doing it bigger and better what it was
was a lot of cgi like the fight with a hundred agent smiths it looks it looks really bad now
it looked bad at the time oh yeah and very over the top and it was like watching a bloody video
game that someone was had the controller and wasn't letting you play it it it it was all about
and they were playing it wrong yes exactly and a lot of uh sequels and reboots and have this
problem where it's more spectacle and less about the the story and it tried to throw in some
light philosophical ideas like the matrix is like existentialism one-on-one brain in your
brain in a jar daycart shit and then they tried to lightly expand upon that in the sequels
they didn't quite work and they had to throw in bigger and better like the the whole motorway
fight sequence there's ghosts now and stitches in the matrix and and agent smith is all cgi
it's just awful too much too much cgi because the i guess the money guys thought well what
do people think of when they think the matrix oh what they call cgi bullet time stunts and there
was a bit more to it than that agree hey ho um rags you need to love the prequels
i love the prequels for the meanie mess that they are
i love them too i would ironically say i love them but not you know for a very specific set
of reasons uh also where's wolf wolf is unavailable he's he's doing a lot more um
work like uh shifts lately but he'll be back following sunday when we'll be doing the next
episode of effip speaking of which uh because that was the last super chat for the moment um
efap has entered um episode 46 today which means we are now very close to episode 50
and we realized there's a crazy coincidence also known as the next middle yes uh the fourth will
be 47 the 11th will be 48 uh the 18th will be 49 and then in the week of the 25th meaning the
50th episode is also the same week get you not but we started the first episode a year ago man
did we plan this out right or what i was gonna say it wasn't actually planned it would be hard
to believe but um i remember thinking about it a few months ago in advance i was like uh it would
be cool if they lined up but you know we can't we don't we didn't we don't plan for double our
episodes there's not a thing that gets planned just the amount of conversation that's happening
and obviously the spider-man one with shadow varsity doubled up and then i was just talking about it
with wolf a few days ago and he's like oh shit they've actually lined up so and this is good
news and bad news i'm afraid bad news first the episode that is the celebration you won will be
on a thursday because we want to match it up it's not a saturday or friday which is what people
would probably want or a sunday whatever so as much as i know that there's a lot of people in
chat that might be like i'd like to be in the whole 24 hours because that'll be so much fun
you know if you've got wick or other arrangements or you know just a life in general then don't feel
bad about catching it whenever you want to slash can yeah thursday the 22nd of next month being
august i mean sorry uh yeah no august uh we'll be doing a 24 hour efap with alternating guests
and infinite content to respond to with the hopes of essentially going through about one video per
well-known efap rug's gallery member so like i'll have to get all that set up in advance and let
everyone know that this is a thing that's happening and i have no idea how much carnage will come from
it but that's gonna be a thing and it'll be episode 50 part one two three and four and i think
i'm gonna do it seven hours apiece for the first three seven 14 21 and then the last one will be
three hours plus depending on how much more energy we have remaining at that point but hopefully me
wolf and rags will be able to make it for the full thing no promises you never know these things
human beings you know they're complicated um and everybody who's been a guest previously will
pretty much be allowed to come back um so i imagine we'll we'll cap it at six people at any one time
i think yeah we don't want to burn out too many people at once either because we gotta go for a
while true and everyone hopefully will be available at different times being that we're friends with
australians americans europeans it's gonna be fabulous um it'll start at 2 p.m bst the 22nd of
august that's 2 p.m bst 22nd of august um 24 hours slow adult stream no no i don't know we'll
definitely be covering tonal though and it'll be fantastic um good luck reading all those stupid
chats for 24 hour stream i'll probably try and break them up there's no way i'll just have like
a fucking four hour section of going through them or anything besides that might be relevant to the
people who are guessing at the time you know do as best as we can but um i think i think that's
that's essentially the small announcement um which kind of leads us close to the end of this episode
which means i'd like our guests to now share exactly where they can be found on the interwebs
um cynic snacks would you like to go first yeah sure um so i my channel cynic snacks uh go and
look at it i have nine videos in total probably in a couple of hours uh they're all like animated
funny fun times i make funny jokes i'm very funny the end i also tweet a lot but i end up saying
really annoying shit that's going to eventually get me cancelled so maybe don't follow me on twitter
but yeah animated film reviews it's good shit and uh posted yeah kind of similar i guess
people people have said that i copy red letter media uh and mystery science theater 3000
despite the fact that i don't watch either of those things but yeah apparently i'm like them
even i'm trying to find out how you copy them because it covers bad movies which is not
copyrighted by them whatsoever i get it too very loose yeah i i see a lot of people saying
it basically comparing any review to red letter media but there are other reviewers out there
other than red letter media and i can vouch for snacks uh if anything he is more talented than
red letter media because he does animation very good animation and animation is a bitch to do
um and i don't see mike skelesky or whatever the fuck his polish name is animating stuff but
yeah i don't mean to tongue cynic snacks ass but he is a friend and he's very talented and it's a
damn bloody shame he hasn't got 10 000 subs and more but he's very talented very fun and you
should check him out i appreciate it thank you i do some stuff too but whatever i was about to
say that's the easy lead-in to being like okay puppet oldman what do you do and why should
people subscribe to you um well they should subscribe because there are videos coming soon
i'm very sorry that there has been delayed due to uh health reasons and personal things um
but videos are in the work there is actually a backlog of videos and i know it sounds like
bullshit but there's actually lots of videos in the work it's just there's a back um but anyway
i i'm professor tosspot i am the host of smack talk a show on roxxas productions and i do reviews
i critique i'm an entertainer of sorts uh i'm just a comfy time killer uh there is a lot of bad
language and dark humor but if that's your thing uh check it out and uh there will be some more
content uh for new viewers and fans alike and i do love my fans thank you for your support and
patience i know it has been a while since my last upload but again that is something i'm trying to
remedy in the next few days but uh yes that is what i do beautiful and then i guess either one
of you can answer this but what's that other thing you guys do it's like a podcast or something
totally talk about that and why people should subscribe to that as well i'm glad i don't do
that podcast shit basically if efap isn't on and you feel like you want some efap there's a really
kind of watered-down budget version i mean that exist participating i i think it's we're like a
sister podcast i yeah i i don't think when we're definitely not like efap we don't go no we're not
like just a podcast where we moan about shit but yeah i i'm often reminded of the um ricky gervais
show that kind of podcast we we do have something we want to talk about but we generally go on
tangents about german shitting tables and whatever takes our fancy uh so it's quite relaxed and uh
uh i wouldn't say i wouldn't say it's not intellectually stimulating but
i'll vouch for it too i enjoy listening to it i i do enjoy listening have they allowed you to
guest on it yet right no wait wow wow wow i've been on it like three or four times i can't remember
yeah but you're british yeah but i think they've had american guests
oh we get loads they had they had nitpicks on and i was asleep when nitpicks was being like
objective critique is dumb and not real i was like damn it if only i was on man not a fan favorite
that episode i will i will it doesn't surprise me considering all of you are about ripping into
media yeah um but yeah we do i read uh we also play games at the end cards against humanity
oh yeah we read weird shit from the internet whether it be a chuck tingle story or just
weird stuff we found um yeah uh it's hosted by uh cynic cynical reviews
and uh and is uploaded on cynical streams and that is uh produced by cj our gracious host
who set up the podcast round about uh christmas yeah we all got together on christmas and uh
snacks of course because he's so talented as the art and i i do the um uh some talking
actually i didn't have to cover for snacks when he was away in asia i had to do some of the
thumbnails and uh my photoshop uh skills are shit but but i but i fought the good fight
so i think you did a good job i don't think anyone even noticed i was gone
you know what i was gonna say like entry level just look for for one of the one i think there's
one where me and jay guessed on there so just watch that and then be like podcast entry level
no that would be the entry podcast and then you can watch all of it once you're like i like the
other people on this not just the people i was coming from efap from because they're wonderful
and yeah uh give it a few more episodes once we get past our 24 hour and we'll do the big crossover
hopefully and i think there's an episode of great which is podcast tomorrow as well well there you
go tune in slash sub-scrizzle right that's what they say yeah kids say these days um yeah well
we could probably do like um three episodes one for gaming one for on our end and then one for
on your end you know yeah we get two episodes out of this big collaborative project and such
quirky characters right you got uh like canine type characters three different types a pizza
puppet three types of pizza i'm not a puppet don't break the fourth wall how i thought with
the art you just showed earlier that it seems like the fan base like it that you're a puppet
i don't know that's what that's what i'm seeing um indeed but yes uh i guess i'll just grab these
last few um howdy rags hello um sweet i'll still be on summer vacation i'll just have to stock up
on snacks and tell everyone i know to leave me alone for 24 hours oh yes the seven what what
efap uh nax you did lake fear three what about one and two um so i covered lake fear three because
it was a worst of 2018 video um and based on just how absolutely appalling that film was
have no end in looking at the other ones um you're just scared yeah you're scared you'll love it
um yeah um in all honesty i i don't know where i'd find um the the copy of lake fear three that
i bought was from it was like a it was it was a used copy that i got online and it was quite
expensive because they're difficult to come by um are they difficult to come to oh yeah and that
so you would rate them challenging wank
out out of ten yeah not bad i mean i never say never if i completely run out of ideas i
impossible to watching i might have to resort to lake fear one and two but i just really don't
think they're going to be worth anyone's time i've i've currently got a stack of dvds right in front
of the demolishing um and they're they're definitely gonna go first
um mario caused season eight failure from bagel bagans also high rags hello
he never gets tired of saying hi it's wonderful yeah i think if i don't if they had an action
figure of you the two things would be like a bark and then um hello i guess well like a pull
string you need two though you can't just have them in two pull strings yeah i just have a string
coming out my asshole uh howdy lads huge fan of efap been recommending your stream to everyone i
met for a month now i've never learned so much and laughed so hard keep up the good work
that's wonderful thank you very much that's great i'm glad you're really liking it
the best kind of learning is fun happy learning so i mean this is the thing like i don't know if
anyone would have learned anything with us covering wisecrack today except how not to make
an argument but hey that's learning hey we can all profit from a bad example that's true
but yeah that pretty much brings us to the end like i said we'll be back next week probably the
same time same day um if you starved for podcast content the great bridge podcast coming on
tomorrow what's the topic you guys are coming you're doing even uh we're covering the extra
credit oh yes of course um there's a few other things just like uh cancel culture in general
um and whatever we fucking feel about it and i'll see if we can throw in a chuck tingle throw in
some gay donuts or any gay uh uh sentient items tingle tingle is a pretty gay last name it is i
mean if you're not like an elf at the north pole and your last name is tingle probably it's it's
funny you say that because he calls his cinematic universe the tingle verse the tingle verse all
interconnected these stories apparently but uh what time is that by the way um i do believe it
might be uh six or seven p.m uh roundabout roundabout efap time i'm gonna say seven p.m
roundabout efap you guys run you you're not short there's a podcast either are you you take you take
a take a leaf from our a book of longman you you you can go you don't go for one or two hours
typically which is the standard podcast time think i don't already podcast a bunch longer than that
but hey yeah so yeah long man content where you'll find um and so on on our podcast we have uh
kind of a scene that that's on screen at all times of the characters sat around a table discussing
things and it's slowly been acquiring kind of memes and props and stuff and i'm not sure if
you've seen it mauler but there's a funko pop of you i did i actually noticed it on the last one
i was in the chat pointing it out and yeah apparently i was supposed to take it offensively
but i actually like it i i i i i i just figured you'd you'd be the kind of person that
despise funko pops and having your own likeness not really preserved in one would annoy you what's
what's the argument against funko pops the collectibles suck because i don't know they're
just a dumb waste of time i guess i think it's a critique of consumerist nerd culture that uh
if you have this funko pop you are validated you've got your nerd credentials i'm okay with people
buying consumable items sumograte items the things they enjoy it's okay have you got a funko pop
um yeah which one do you own yeah which one i don't think i actually have any but i wouldn't
have a problem with having any you don't even know hanger you don't know there was actually
a long pause like you went straight up i wouldn't buy one myself but well for example i've got a
tywin figure that my mom got me because she knows i like tywin that's sweet um he's not a funko he's
just a realistic depiction oh by way by way of an olive branch um i'm currently drawing the second
funko pop to go on our shelf that is going to be rags oh so oh yeah you should add it the same time
he guests do it okay oh oh that's another thing who's your guest for tomorrow do you have one
yeah i believe it's detective deckard but who i'm not sure that doesn't that doesn't sound like
rags that's quite fitting to have him he's a he's a documentarian might say i'd describe him as
oh um uk-based youtuber huh yeah i hadn't heard of him well get rags on his fursona is fursona
is a crocodile actually yeah you should have you need to have rags and wolf on before we do our
crossover otherwise it's like you know you got to set up all the mini episodes first before the
big episode is it what makes sense it's like introducing a character at the very end who's
supposed to be the best of them all exactly i guess we could yeah but we could just do like a
post-credit scene you could just wreck on wolf and rags into the great british podcast universe i
guess yeah it's like um no not really a spoiler um but in spider-man the new spider-man they
decided to like re-show an old scene from a different movie and then add a new character
in as if they were there the whole time and it kind of annoyed me a little bit um so that's it
take on nude soup they turned into game of thrones shills after season eight uh did nude soup do video
essays i thought they were like a podcast i think they were podcasts i don't know i don't know
enough about nude soup but you know maybe one day maybe one i don't really care for soup i prefer
my food a bit more solid i don't even understand how you'd have a nerdy soup is it like soup with
nude blood in it it's funko soup melted funko for soup um but yeah that about does it is there
anything else anybody wants to talk about before we head away for the night no it's pretty good
timing i gotta pretty much head out once we close dinner to go to well uh thank you for having us on
i guess anything i say to that uh thank you uh very much appreciate it and you have a lovely
audience very dedicated very very great yeah very friendly yes very funny as well i've laughed
many many many times at chat yeah we got we got a quick wit you really do when i when i see like
destiny and people like that always getting into these terrible arguments and spats with their
chat i'm like mad it makes me appreciate the audience that we have it really really does
that's like a funko version of myself to a degree these are the cutesy droids we haven't
had one of them in a while we have them for the dog trial these good shit lovely little
cutesy kind of cartoony style i really like this is my favorite um but yeah thank you all for
watching thank you for the clever interesting memes i know a lot of them aren't being shown
a lot of people don't don't panic we're saving all the ones that aren't episode specific up for
the 50th episode so we're gonna need a lot of memes a lot of videos to go through is gonna be great
so thank you for all them thank you for the very kind donations and of course thank you to the
long-standing guest mr rags hello and the two guests for the episode cynic snacks and professor
tosspot thank you um have a good time have a good night everybody or morning or afternoon and we
like i said we'll see you next week you can catch this episode on moolah the channel is my second
