a long-lasting painful erection wait oh yeah no i've heard about you
a priapism oh not not a pria plism rag's nose is
erection uh well i i i was in like search and
rescue so i i know i know the word he's talking about it's
just funny that he called it a pria plism i guess i've only ever seen that
word written there's not even an l i guess i'm just
done there nah it's it's not something that comes
up in conversation often i like the idea that one does not normally talk about it
a medically it does come up when you get bitten by a
spider an ailment where you have a a constant
painful erection that won't go away i like the idea that he was like oh it's
just like maybe an accident difference pronunciation difference you're like
don't know you had to do it like you you changed it to be fair aluminium
aluminum aluminum aluminium aluminium yeah it's aluminium nope
i'm just gonna say something wild here maybe they're both okay
a l u m i n u m how can we live in a world where you can pronounce things in
two ways jay everything cats and dogs living with each other
that happens already that's fine that's cute
especially very good cat and a good doggo being friends that's cute
just trying to distract us from the subject of spiders are creepy even though
they can tell the future
i don't think they're used as villainous creatures in lots of media
like lord of the ring racism misunderstood
i just want to sit on their webs eating flies
do you reckon shelob fucked up seeing the future
and that's why what happens in return of the king happens
yes i think the thing to think about not that you would know jay still unfinished
lord of the rings right no but i know anyway that's interesting
have you like forgotten fellowship at this point
i've not forgotten it you do you understand how much people are upset by
you not having seen it um i i my guess is that some some of the
people at this point telling me to see it haven't seen it themselves
and it's just memeing and you know i doubt it most people just have seen lord
of the rings projecting kind of wheezed out of it
disgusting he's trying to place his ignorance of the lord of the rings and
the lack of watching it onto other people lord of the ignorance more like
a lot of the ignorance um yeah hello welcome to efap 54
the one where we finally have a brand new fresh wonderful guest keep
bringing him back the old people because you know one of those
podcasts just never moves on but today we have the wonderful aiden paladin
welcome how'd you do oh i'm doing pretty good hey thanks for having me on
no problemo we need to you know gotta expand you know
but um yeah i saw um i'll be honest i haven't seen
like a lot of things from your channel but i did watch the uh the quinton one
popped up in my recommended how about that
it's like wow sometimes sometimes just every once in a while once in a blue moon
youtube's recommended algorithm works you know yeah there's a constant
discussion of like you know some people like oh to get the
channel work you to hit the algorithm it's like how it's like i have no idea
but you gotta do it it's a combination of a whole bunch of
things that no one's figured out yeah we have a scientist team on it
how's that going jay i'm yeah jay great yeah jay's all scientist team
it's on it i am the team i'm the only thing he can't
study is the lord of the rings that's against his religion
you'd be fair to be fair there are people who do study lord of the rings
academically i actually had a lecture from some guy who he came into class and
he just unrolled this giant roll and it went
like 30 feet long this scroll and it's like here is a
truncated history of middle earth he was literally a professor of tolkian
studies so you you can you can scientifically
study that apparently what he must be drowning in percy what
was his overall point like was he like was it a lesson about lord of the rings
something we draw out of it so he was a guest he was a guest
lecturer so i don't even remember what he was talking about specifically i think
he was just it was he was there for one lecture
but i do remember i always remember his scroll
did he not did he not want to put it in a traditional like folder he had to have
a scroll i mean i'm sure there was some
pretentious affectations as there there is with almost all academics
of no no it has to be a scroll so then i can you know roll it out like that and
impress people i can't just put it on a powerpoint
presentation like everybody else
yeah you never know you don't know i mean efap for us has been a big lesson
of you never know what's on youtube don't know what people are going to do
i suppose you you do a bit of study on that
and into what people conclude from different different things in their
daily lives and how fascinating that can be
oh yeah that's pretty much what i do um yeah a couple couple of things to cover
before we before we get into anything um oh i guess i should say you know hello
jane rags as well i guess i disagree with that
right doesn't have anything to say about that all right good i'm glad we
well i was i was expecting you i was expecting you to say
you know hi rags and then i'd say i'd say hi
and we we carry on hello rag is no i'm sorry no i i did a different
so i can't remember if i mentioned this on efap or not but i definitely
mentioned it somewhere youtube have been changing
thumbnails does it know about this yes what happened to me um nothing nothing
is significantly bad as i actually changing a thumbnail to have different
things on it they've been changing the brightness and
contrast is really odd um someone on twitter
youtube knows better than you well that's pretty much their argument they've
they uh fretted my notice that he was like my thumbnail's like ugly as hell
when other people when you look at your own you don't see it
but when people look at yours that are like not in your profile they see it and
he got sent it by a friend and then he checked with someone else and
yeah they've been changing them and he like complained and then they responded
like yep we've been experimenting with improving thumbnails no worries
like um it's amazing because someone there are people that you this is this
is perfect perfectly um some symbolic of what
youtube does he's like oh that thumbnail that you
made well we know that we can make it better
and we're not going to ask you about it whatever you did we're youtube
what when we do it it'll just be better we'll just change what you did to make
it better don't worry that's a question do you know
like what changed was was it color saturation in particular
i don't know what exactly the the layman's version i have is just it
just looked like they improved brightness or accentuated and lots of uh
lots of thumbnails looking overexposed and um i noticed it with some of the
efap thumbnails but i thought i was seeing shit on my second monitor i was
just like oh must be some weird thing that's going on my monitor or something
um that might be a thing because um and there's tons of research on this that
you know people are drawn to bright colors
and you know youtubers absolutely use that all the time of
giant text red font or you know red font color
oh yeah that kind of stuff that might be an attempt of them to if there's some
towns in the united states for example where like mcdonald's can't have the big
yellow arches they have to be green because
it's a more neutral color um certain towns and areas will pass
man it's like that's that might be youtube trying to cover their ass on
clickbait but uh you're you're more you're correct though
right that they just kind of do shit i was gonna say some of their decisions
just come across as like what is the reason for this
like i can't even see it they seem youtube is run by a bunch of kleptomaniacs
you just want to own everything you do and it must be mine i can change it
however i want because it belongs to me it's um i like to pretend that they have
some scientific reason for doing it but yeah it's it's probably just the
egomaniacal craziness they don't care they clearly don't care if they make
any money because they never have
um and yes i was hoping one day they'll make money
like i've heard that some thumbnails have actually seen
improvements as in some careers like oh yeah that does kind of look better but
i'm just like um that's coincidental i feel like that's
just gonna be an accident as a result of destroying 99 other thumbnails per one
you know yeah if you if you apply the same effect to a
million thumbnails yeah some people will be like oh why didn't i think of that
that turned out okay i mean and that's how scam emails
happen and it's just funny that this happened
like right after the verification thing like they're just they don't care they
just roll in random things out there's like oh this is happening now you're
like what oh they just hope people won't notice
that's it they just hope people won't notice and the only reason they walked
back the verification is because so many people made a stink about it
and then they use that good karma or whatever it is uh to just sneak in
something else stupid i really hate it how are you finding
the creative studio this is the old it's
absolutely abysmal but it's always been abysmal
i hate it and i hate the fact that i can't
not use it without jumping through hoops it's so
incredibly freaking frustrating and i just
i despise it it used to be so much easier and i don't know
who it's designed for i really don't they always say we spoke to creators and
viewers alike yeah well show me some data on that show
me one person who said like i'm just this like really awkward
person who's clearly paid they're like i love it it is
really good brown table really likes it probably probably brown yeah i could
see him like hey i saw this video by this jay xy
guy who was like hey it does some things better and i was like wow this guy's
wrong they did just radically improve it um
like the the specific thing like in that video
has now been like hugely improved which is like the searching for comments
they've like it's really in depth now and you've got
loads of options if you say so oh really i'll trust you yeah they've
added loads of new filters that you can add to like
looking through your comments so you can like uh like filter comments from users
with certain amounts of subscribers or whatever
i don't know it's loads of different ones that's the one i remember
well um something well since we're actually talking about youtube
doing stupid things um yesterday i noticed something i i almost posted it
to you guys but i was randomly recommended
a segment from ralph bakshi's wizards and i watched it it was really good uh
it's the part where the evil soldiers go into the
temple and they meet the jewish priests and
and right after this that section in wizards
again our ralph bakshi animated film the
the recommended next video to autoplay was like a legit kids nursery rhyme
cartoon animation and i'm like these two
shouldn't be together
they're you never really know what they're doing and they seem to
perpetually get worse and it made me think about how all the
kids who really do go through the autoplay
whatever's and they're watching nursery rhymes and
you know uh johnny johnny things and all that stuff
and then boom they get a you know they get a fritz the cat clip or
something like that and i'm like oh that's a bit of a tonal shift remember
that whole controversy with the videos of kids and stuff oh yeah
that was creepy some are weird but you some of these channels
that play the the kid cartoon stuff billions with a b of views oh yeah
it's insane because what parents do so often is
they have the tablet they turn it on kids mode and they just give it to the
kid and yeah just play is autoplay all day
and rags i don't know if you were there for the episode of
of um tales that actually got put in the children section
and and like recommended for children because it said something about clowns
or something in the title i don't remember
if you guys don't know rags and i've been playing uh pathfinder together for
like almost a year now every week so mostly every week
but one of our very not not safe for work not safe for children
episodes of pathfinder got put on in the children's tab
so imagine yeah watching uh johnny yes papa and then
hearing naka levi's drunken scottish voice
just dropping end bombs yeah youtube's not great
no not great not great i think we talked about this before but it's just like
imagine having a good employer like this in real life like i know it's not
exactly the same thing but just you just come into work you never know what
they're gonna do or say you could just be randomly fired
they could invent some random new rules and then i just picture this
cloud person that comes out of their office like hello how you doing you're
like hi what are you what are you what's
what's happening today and they're just like i'm gonna take your computer and
uh replace it with this pen i filled your desk chair with
beans it's like thanks there are four spiders in this office
it's it's it's the kind of thing where you just
fucking i don't know what to expect um so something that people want us to
address uh only briefly i'm sure it doesn't
matter that much sputamen is back in the mcu not not not like the
huge i mean j you took it quite well right you see this is a very good plus
what would be your reasons for why this is a good plus
um i imagine they'll now get to conclude the arc that
they were already doing with him in the way that they initially planned
i want to see that story play out you know i don't want to i don't want the
future movies to not be able to mention anything that's
really happened to him in the last couple you know everything was shaped by
iron man and inferior and all that as far as i can tell
the counter would be vitamin is less free
with marvel that's not true though well i don't and this is the thing i'm not
so new advocates for that they're like sony would have been able
to take him to a better direction put him in with marvel means you might be
fucked over with captain marvel and stuff
the only thing that makes me sad about it is i feel it means we're less likely
to get like the live action spider spider verse movie
with like tom holland andrew garfield and toby maguire we all
would have liked that it would have been neat that would have been awesome
but it wouldn't have been like the comic books
well i this is the thing my position is i really hope they bank on what i think
they're banking on this whole time which was
origin they dropped a seed in for like the beginning of a superhero all the way
up to when he's an adult and it's like watching because you know
like iron man thor cap and hulk wheels they all took one film
to basically be the person we we know them as and their journey wasn't
like cap probably had the most origin like story out of all of them
um but this one is like gonna have you know three movies to
slot into what we see spider-man as at least i think and then maybe three
movies as a spider-man like the rainy movies are coming
once they've done their origin set and i just really hope we get a really
long set of movies a really long story and it could build up to be one of the
best hero characters ever and i know plenty
of people hate him but um they're wrong
it's just that i'm not too concerned because you know the adaptation argument
right that um i like this version myself i'm on
board with it i get that people don't like that he's
not quite like the one they want but maybe they'll get the one they want
soon maybe in this next film he somehow gets cut off
from like the stock help so he has like a pretty low amount of money and nobody's
helping him then maybe he's a bit more down in his
luck that sort of thing so it feels like that's one of the main things people
really want back is that he's 100 himself as opposed to has any help
whatsoever but maybe we'll get that who knows that
seems like a really easy thing to write into the plot it's been done
in spider-man comics many times before and that's the thing about it's like not
the version that i want well there's like a hundred different versions of
spider-man or peter parker different points in his
of his life throughout the history of the comic books there were times where
yeah he was like he was the head of his own business he's
married to a supermodel things are going pretty good for pd and then there's
other times where it's you know the more origin story story
uh kind of stuff where he's a teenager and he's down on his luck and he's broke
but i i get i think it depends on um your individual preference because
there are different aspects of that character
and then of course we we see him go through the entire cycle of coming
from a teenage boy into the adult spider-man and of course it has to end
in one more day just as it did in the comics when people got tired of seeing
spider-man become an adult oh you mean like too many of the stories
are about him becoming an adult well no there were um in the uh in the
late 90s a lot of the people who were running
marvel comics at that point in time were people who grew up
um in the 70s and the 60s and they got kind of upset both at marvel and
dc and dc was a lot of dandido uh and marvel was a lot of jokey
sada and some other people who wanted to take it back to the way things
were when they were kids so what people often considered to be
the worst spider-man comic ever written was a way of undoing all of the
character development that had happened over the last 30 years
so you know graduating high school graduating college
you know becoming a researcher uh mary and mary jane all of the stuff that had
happened um the heads at marvel decided well
time to start over again as they do in films all the time
and wrote the worst the absolute worst spider-man comic ever
where aunt may is dying and pete has to find some way to save her now she says
by the way pete i'm like 100 i'm ready to die
and he says no will i go ask my friend mr fantastic who's a super genius
to help save aunt may i won't do that will i ask my friend elixir the omega
level mutant who can heal things at an atomic level nope i'm
gonna make a deal with the marvel devil save aunt may it is widely regarded as
the abs and it just all it did was just erased
all this character development as hated as that comic is i guarantee they will
do something similar because you can't actually have characters
develop in this shit they always have to be able to reset it
clarification are you like are you big into spider-man comics
i yeah i know well i'm a big comic book fan in general oh
what's your take on mcu spider-man yeah i um
it's fine but the homecoming was a blue beetle movie
which is exactly what i said about it when i first saw it which is that this is
pretty cool but it would be better if it was called blue beetle and about haimi
reus um he was a dc character but uh my opinion
is that uh garfield spider-man was really good
for only one reason which is the reason when the scene where he hands the kid
the mask when he's holding up the car he says
put this on it'll make you strong that's a true spider-man moment
of who spider-man is to peter parker tippy mcguire was a great peter
parker at least a young peter parker in terms of being a
doofy you know goofy guy um and holland is kind of in the middle
so i'm all right with him uh fair enough i mean what do you think of
the direction of taking him in the mcu
his spider-man's place in the mcu in particular or just the mcu sure the
fact that he's almost a protege of iron man
and that um he's probably the least experienced
and most struggling of the of the set of heroes
i don't necessarily have a problem with it um again to me it
it felt like a blue beetle movie and if you don't know anything about blue beetle
it makes well it's what the movie essentially
was that's that character's storyline that was just
usurped more or less um haimi reus blue beetle
specifically i don't hate it i do think that
by having tony come in and providing um all the technology and all the funding
as you mentioned earlier it takes away some of peter's agency
by basically saying well he wouldn't i mean he was doing some stuff on his own
but he wouldn't have had this same level now i would bring up that the
comic books particularly i can't remember which one it is i think
it's an astonishing x-men on joth weeden's run actually
there's a scene where everybody thinks they're saving the
earth from this giant uh bullet that's going to hit it and
it's a giant space bullet and everyone is being mind-controlled
into thinking that they're going to be able to stop
the bullet so storm you know creates a giant uh
whirlwind and blows it back into space and thor hits it with a hammer
and spider-man builds a giant web across the buildings in new york city
and then while he's doing it he goes wait a minute that's retarded
and wakes up out of the hallucination so i already think spider-man recognizes
that he's not like on the same level as thor and hulk
that's common in the comics as well so him having a little bit of a
advantage i guess makes some sense when you're talking about
the inherent power disparity between a lot of the characters
sure um firing right to takes issue with me
describing as most struggling uh you you've all seen a lot of the mcu
movies who do you think beats out spider-man for
piss news struggles um especially considering far from home
and homecoming and i mean die in a game well infinity
war i don't know i think it's pretty close
if you look at all of them i don't think any of them of uh
you have you have a little sucks um yeah i mean i'm not saying it's
like uh far and away but it's spider-man but
that kid's been brought low several times uh as far as i'm concerned just
not not in the way that i think people wanted
him to be conversation i suppose um i guess i
should oh of course i don't know how i forgot this
uh what i have to ask the star wars question to our brand new game
um oh no this oh no the star wars question
so episode nine considering we're all very sure it's going to be
hideously poorly written um what do you think
in terms of like the characters who do you think is going to be the most
inconsistently written well i think to be inconsistently written
they would have to have been consistently written before
so i'm not sure yeah that's part of why there's uh there's like qualifiers for
this in terms of like we were like okay you can't pick kylo because
there's nothing consistent about him in the first place you can't pick palpatine
because we did not know he was going to be in it when we wrote this so it's not
fair because everybody would probably pick him
you have to keep him out um and lando we we were in
did it him either but everybody else you could pretty much choose
whoever you want um we've got loads of different votes for those different
people with those different arguments but i think it is fair to recognize that
it could just it's probably just gonna be everybody but you know
well it probably will be everybody but my couple of thoughts about what's
gonna happen based on just the stuff that i've
seen the previous stuff is that the raving evil thing is
bullshit that's that's going to be a dream or a
vision or something that's definitely not actually happening
because ray has to be perfect in every way
um although i saw that toy with the metal arm and or with the robot arm
and i'm just like oh no are they really doing this i'm not sure
has that been confirmed all i know is will class bullshit has said that toy
was bullshit okay i don't i don't know anything more
than that it might be real but i don't think it is
okay good because that would that would be terrible
you know but i right now it's mostly rumors and
well it's during they even reused stills they're not trying to
it's very odd that they are not advertising this movie
at all nude roderick just said it was a fake he's in shirt apparently it's fake
all right that's oh thank god then well because that would have been
i you know what it's so bad i could see them doing that
it's so it's such a train wreck that in order to course correct
their like dual drifting train that's going on two tracks at the same time
just killing everybody that's pat i can't imagine what they're going to do
i i imagine though that it's going to be just erasing everything about the last
film and pretending it didn't happen yeah
so in terms of character consistency i guess
fin is going to be the most inconsistent because he's been all
over the place too like every time he seems to have a
character arc it gets messed up and i think here they're gonna
i wonder if they're gonna i i'm not really sure
i ray is going to be consistent in that she's always going to be a married
suit so she could say i will say would be the most consistent
fin and po are probably going to be the ones that are going to get
messed up if they're even in it yeah fin and po are the the most voted for
outside of luke is catching up with po um yeah fin is the top vote most people
vote for him i don't know i think it's just everyone thinks that fin is gonna
be someone or do something that's just again gonna leave us confused
also yeah there was a quote from um jj abrams
along the lines of mentioning the word fixing
um not saying that like he's never come into a project with the intention of
fixing anything like he doesn't say he's fixing episode
nine requirement of fixing something well yeah um he he goes on to say
something like it's um you know you respect the work that
came before you and that he's done plenty of projects
where he starts them and then other people take them over and that he's
going to be taking over someone else's work and so you have to honor that
basically telling people that he won't be changing anything from episode eight
and it's like you you will well it's already the trailer who
thinks changed in the trailer yeah like he
rebuilds everything that like ryan physically broke
it's gonna be great and uh this is this is a stronger and bigger and more
massive than ever oh no that's the feeling that this this repair
job is being done with duct tape kind of level
repair you know i just like it's amazing that there's an excitement level again
but it's all for the wrong reasons everyone's like kind of excited to see
what what things are gonna happen i'm sure
there's gonna be some reveals in this film that are gonna make us go like oh
my god they did that like i i feel like they
wouldn't give everything away so excited to say the least at how they
would have destroyed even more because that's all styles is these days
i guess my biggest question in general and i guess i'd have to ask myself this
too is what what's the dumbest thing that they will
probably do you know what i mean like what's the
absolute stupidest thing i would bet time travel from red letter media
time travel i agree with them on that i i
if it's time travel please do it yeah
just kill me already like you know if you're
they just kind of been i mean it's dead the franchise is definitely dead
but they need to really you know drop like a proper grenade on it just to
blow it make sure there's nothing left uh and a time travel time travel plot
line but certainly do that i would be so up for some really blatantly
poor lines of they do the time travel then they're like
wow it's like none of that ever happened none of it
none of it happened to the camera they're like okay
get it
and luke woke up on indoor addled by ewok boos yeah i had a terrible terrible
dream everybody i'm so glad you're all okay it's
just it's it's all just a dream the night after the party
it's just luke having too much you are like the de-aging effects are really bad
they're like luke you look really old he's like it doesn't matter it's fine
it's fine like yeah this is this is all episode six
everything's great look harder layer over there and they're facing away
just like yep they're fine uh everyone's fine and it's great roll credits
to be honest i would almost prefer that
yeah i'd laugh right like thank goodness
thank goodness this is canon now none of that ever happened
uh though they try again uh rags did you see rambo yet
uh no all right well i won't spoil anything but people were like
concerned that i said it was better than john wick three um
metal command is currently working you know metal command is working on a
script to talk about john wick three i'm helping
them out with it as well as giving him pointers so you'll eventually see a
video that expresses my grievances with john wick
three it's not gonna happen on my channel and obviously if i was to
try and argue why i think john wick two and three are awful
it would take some time and i and i would need to because it's um
both very respected and loved films we're not talking about like a
well like an episode nine here i wouldn't need to go over a lot so
for people who are like very concerned with hearing what why i have issues with
those it'll come it's just that if i was to do it
seriously i'd need to actually like prepare a debate style thing probably
um but you'll you'll get your reasons eventually because i know people i take
pot shots at them all the time it's just that i don't necessarily explain much
what i will tell you guys is that fringy always references it as
a thing that we disagree on but fringy is now in the team
of john wick two sucks as well or at least i think he's pretty much on that
team and he already thought that john wick three sucks so
we're getting there yeah we watched um a few days ago
we watched a bunch of clips of like john wick two and john wick three
and like when you actually go back and look at a lot of these especially action
scenes they're actually really not good at all
the first ones were great but man the second and third um
yeah to clarify i love john wick one still uh yeah i love john i hate john
wick two and then john wick three is funny to me it's like a clown film um
because i've already lost my investment at that point but i know people are
desperate for explanations and to give you like an actual fair one
just wait a little bit longer and you'll get one from um from metal though
if you catch me like on a stream i could probably ramble off some opinions
quickly but i would rather do it you know in a
clear and good way rather than giving you something
that's um crappy and rambly like i said and yeah
rambo uh just just the big vision that's like i think it's with seeing
especially for rambo fans and um there are a couple of things i wanted to
say but i'll keep it maybe next d fat with
something once rags is seen i want to be spoiling it especially
um which takes us to the wall everybody who's been very obsessed with
me and rags covering nostalgia critics the wall video
now before i say anything else that's not even a video we could really cover
because there's loads of music in it and there's a good chance we'd be
strike to hell um as well as struck
striked is that not stricken stricken stroke
yes strong strong strong we'd be strung we'd be strunk to hell
uh yeah no i mean i mean if nostalgia critic has got
copyright stuff on his music because it's his music in
in the video i guess um the jar podcast covered it did you guys
already do it or you're debating that well well i was just gonna say so me and
rags went on an adventure we watched it was an event we was it
was an adventure we heard about all this and we were like
everyone's like what is on efap and we're like all right let's see what this
is so we watched nostalgia critics video then we watched
portions of i hit everything's video yeah ralph's video
um needle drops video some other guy's video
then we watched the wall and we had a discussion
with fana the animation artist from the video and
i hosted what you could call a debate between
cj cynical reviews man and fana and listen to them that was like two
hours um and my conclusion after all of this is
kind of just meh um which is my watch i mean i watched it
i thought it was incredibly i i also hate to use the word cringe but
but then again that's been my general opinion of the nostalgia critic for
years yeah so i kind of thought that like people
took it out of proportion only because of what he was because of the subject
matter i think in part and because it's very near and dear to
many many people and two because what is it exactly i don't
actually know what he was trying to do with it
so what we did was what we watched the nostalgia critic video and then we
decided to after because we were kind of shell
shocked afterwards we we had a bit to say during it but
there were a lot of stretches where we just
were quiet and we just watched the review
and after that was done and we kind of reconnected with reality we went and we
watched like four or so responses to the
nostalgia critics and they were all terrible
like we watched um the i have to say ralph took the cake with that one
yeah we watched the jar podcast and they were just fucking flat out wrong we only
we only once finished we were able only you checked out like two minutes of
that right or is it five yeah then we just yeah then we checked out
because um pretty much near the beginning right off
the bat they're like there's no criticism in it and i'm like okay you
didn't fucking watch the video so this podcast is worthless
well they're they start off by saying they were big fans and i think that he
had a lot of bias going in they were very upset very yeah then we
watched ralph's video which was absolute garbage tier
yeah ralph's video was awful ralph movie maker yeah yeah
my name is sia he made his response to his his reaction i guess you could call
it to the review was it really was garbage to
your crap um definitely the worst uh worst one we
saw that night definitely the worst video we saw that
night yeah we moved on i was just gonna say to bag up like
because people are gonna be annoyed at this but it's just like the thing is
with ralph's one is that um i think he thinks
that it's unequivocally obvious that the thing is bad for obvious reasons and so
all he did was play clips and laugh there's a couple of times where i think
he says a couple of things but i'd say the most offending part of
the video is where he shows a bunch of the animation from fenner and
then just says it's bad it's bad it sucks this is bad like oh
okay he misses the even he plays clips and he misses he doesn't listen to what
the clips were saying misses doesn't even address the points
of the clip just oh it's bad because i went in thinking it would be bad and
everyone says it's bad and it's gonna be bad
so uh yeah they're very lost a lot of respect for ralph that this
in particular um abgn video or not even chance
you think no you think it'd roll for you oh god
oh no this this uh that's terrible because i love abgn
but this this particular nostalgia critic video got so much
weird hate when again to me the only thing i saw would
in it mostly was it's cringy but yeah it's always
been cringy like this it's it's weird and cringy sort of in a lot of places
but while we while while mauler and i were watching it
i think i had to just stop it like three or four times and say holy
shit the amount of time and effort and production that went
into this is actually kind of mind-boggling
like with all the the locations they use and the costumes they make
and the editing like this is this is an insane thing to
witness on youtube this is incredible yeah which isn't exactly unheard of for
nostalgia critic a lot of his skits are of that degree i just um
you know i hate to say it but it's like you put a lot of effort into something
where i'm just like all right that was the thing you did
but lots of kind of nuts yeah uh i don't know how else to put it
um i guess you could you could move on we went to the needle drop
who um um we we agreed was pretty funny but he uh
he's only he says he's only addressing the album i think
but he still only says it's bad and then he says something like like i don't
want to think about it for longer than i already have
it's bad yeah we didn't really pull much from it
because we didn't learn anything from it we didn't we didn't get anything out of
it you know as a review of a review i guess
a response to a review um and our because our fourth which was
the best of the four i still didn't like it but
the the best of the fourth was like a small channel had like 400 subs or so i
forget the name yeah but he went into a bit more depth
also i wanted to make sure i mentioned just because we said
that he had high production in like a lot of elements doesn't mean they weren't
low production in elements too like he had oh yeah it was
his green screening and cutting out of like images in different places that
were really awkward like with weird outlines and
yeah it's all over the place um it's the best worst video
that you could probably think of like it's it's both the spectrums of
amazing and absolutely terrible all meshed together into one
weird creation it's it's a really odd video i mean i don't i don't dislike it
or like it's it's just a weird floaty thing
it's really really odd i i think it gets a lot of unnecessary hate though
i in fact yes i guess that brings us to because like we would
that last video we watched addressed a little bit more of like
nostalgia critics missing a lot of what inspired the wall or the wall
addresses from the key characters experiences in life and stuff
and so i think a lot of people watched his video and assumed that he was almost
making fun of slash missed a lot of the more meaningful details
and um it definitely upset people and i think it makes sense because this is
an older piece of content that is very much in the hearts of a lot of people
and it's not it's not even limited to british people as those of americans
that absolutely adorping floyd right well i say that across the world there
isn't so sure him doing this like it's it's like
stepping on people's toes hardcore if they think that you've
ignored the part of the song that they connect to
deeply and so everyone's really pissed and i was like okay i get that i really
do and so i started going through the
script of nostalgia critics video while i was in a call with rags and i was
just trying to i was reading out some of the things that were being said
in terms of criticism of the wall if you call that or um
uh appraisals to to a certain degree i think there's compliments
criticism as well as parody slash tribute it's a whole
big bag and so yeah it's really a mix um like there's someone in chat who
already said regs defending a 40 minute doug walker vanity project like see
you just proven my point you just proven my point
like so none of these responses talk about what's actually said
in the review like the fourth one does just a teeny
tiny little bit in a couple places but for the most part the entire thing is
thrown away and discounted like there isn't an actual
whole set of script and words and criticism that's interlaced in the
whole video people just forget it's it's it's kind of baffling people just act
like he doesn't say anything for 40 minutes
i think it's because the tone is inconsistent
is what makes people also upset because they can't figure out
what it's supposed to be because normally with media
our brains kind of like really comprehend so many things at the same
time right so and that's just that's just from a biological standpoint
um in terms of our cognitive energy so i think if you put too many things it's
it's parody and it's criticism and it's review
and it's satire and it's praise all at the same time
and particularly because it's broken up into some more like sort of song format
and will skip format it makes it seem disconnected
from the yeah it is cool yeah i i don't think anyone
who watched i don't think any of these people watched it a second time
that's what i get uh they just like watched it and went off first
impressions or off of memory and there was so much shit going on in
that review that there's no way you can listen to it
just one time and walk away with a you will walk away with like oh yeah i
know exactly what he was saying and i don't even
still know everything that was said but there were parts where we stopped and we
talked about what doug was saying and there's stuff to pull from it there's
stuff to pull from the review and what was said in the review and it seems like
none of the people discussed any of that at all
it's like it didn't exist give you an example this is something we were
talking about once we'd read through the script but it was like so
this is the same sort of comparison i gave but the difference between like a
book and a film for a lot of people is that books are automatically ruined
because a film will lock in visuals while a book
describes them and the the viewer can generate it in their heads as to what
exactly the place looks like it can be much more
let's say beautiful um to them at the very least and so when you have a film
even like lord the rings this applies to all game of thrones whatever else but
people are looking at this world like oh this is what that looked like
oh okay and then especially if you have production limits it can actually be
very sour compared but then some other people might argue they find it more
immersive to see a living breathing flesh and bloodstone
thing that they can actually play so much research on this i'm sorry like i'm
sure you probably have way more insight about this than i do i'm just saying
like as a basic sort of thing for the audience that they get the difference
right so criticism in nostalgia critics video
is that when you convert music into a film form
you lock down these these ideas and these these
almost more abstract stuff into actual visuals
into um static ideas and um maybe not static i don't know if
that's too offensive like i don't i'm not trying to criticize it myself i'm
trying to explain the idea so you see it and you're like oh that is what that is
one to one but then the music can can be freer let's say and so
one of them is saying uh one of the characters is saying that in
if you translate it to film you should take advantage and
provide more detail and more um let's say layers to it if you're
going to be uh more locking in i guess or something
like that like i'd have to read out the parts of the script i just found it
interesting to read through i was like oh yeah that i guess because like me and
rags watched the wall afterward and um i i would go as far as saying
some of it could uh use a bit more flesh myself i could i could use a bit more
detail as to what all of it is is trying to say maybe
um so there's a conversation to be had is the point
i could easily have someone else come in here and be like what the fuck you're
talking about that's nonsense because blah blah blah and i'd be like oh okay
but a lot of the critics of of nostalgia critics video don't mention
any of the conversation it's just none of it it's just bad
it's just bad it's just a bad video and they don't explain why they're going to
really any of the reasons why i hate everything did talk about
more stuff i watched that one fully rags didn't see all of it it's
just that um there's a lot of nonsense and i hate
everything's one as well like he just said like they they throw
off the whole animated section as a deviant art like okay yeah oh that's
the most substantive densely packed part of
the review that you should probably spend the most time talking about
but just like with ralph he just sees it playing and he just
leans back oh this is what is this this is god this is shit
and he just moves on like it wasn't even there and even in the review of the guy
who said it was the best part he didn't talk about anything that actually
was said in that section it's it's weird people just don't even
i don't they just went in wanting to hate it or they see something weird
and they don't want to actually discuss what's going on in there
and it's it's kind of frustrating to see that especially when
if anything on youtube with all of the lazy ass reviewers that we have
who talk in these broad ambiguous subjective
nonsensical couple minute videos they pump out that take no effort whatsoever
oh i saw the movie here's what it is i'm going to spend
five minutes on it give to my patreon and i'm not going to tell you really
anything about it oh it did bad pacing or oh the tone or oh i felt this you
know this stuff that doesn't really help you at all
and then you have doug walker for all of his faults
is actually putting in an insane amount of effort for this stuff
and there is stuff in there script wise that's interesting to talk about and
there are discussions to be had that he brings up and people just
pass right over it and just laugh for the record i don't know about you
rags but i wouldn't call nostalgia critics the whole video good
i also know it's not good it's it's not good it's not
it's weird it's it's very strange it is a very strange one it's not good
we recognized even before we looked into reviews of it you know
we've said this before but the part where he said he shows
the idea of pink floyd's issues outweigh everyone else's
and that's a almost pretentious unfair part
to the the original the wall and nostalgia critics saying like you
shouldn't almost criticizing them for saying
your your problems are more important than everyone else's
and it's just like i don't think i don't think that's what
floyd would go forward a little bit yeah he he definitely got
parts of the he definitely misinterpreted or he pulled away some
things that i just think are inaccurate to what pink floyd was saying especially
when we watched the review the first time where we were able to say i
understand what doug's saying but i don't know if it's accurate or not
i understand the point that he's bringing up but since we haven't seen
the wall at that time we didn't know if it was accurate and
then we watched the wall and we were like yeah doug was just wrong
about this stuff um but all in all i feel like this video is it's kind of
like youngblood all over again where if like rags dares to say it's not
as terrible as everyone just claims it is without ever backing it up
then rags is wrong and he shouldn't be defending it
which is not the kind of it's just not the kind of thing
i i would hope that after all the efap that we've done
we would have grown out of this infantile mindset
but i suppose we haven't quite done that yet
i mean this isn't the first time that we've we've apparently had terrible
controversial takes that we're trying our best to
explain like and we're confused as to how we're reaching
different conclusions exactly because like i said i didn't i did my homework
for this i've talked i went through like a whole
bunch of videos as well as the source talked to i had held a debate between two
people with different mindsets that would like polar opposite
and here i am on on what is eventually eventually on
essentially the fence confused basically i don't see
what uh people are drawing out and when i see a lot of it's just bad
i'm like okay yeah it's not an argument um though like i said it's a it's a
project not an argument i did bring up uh the
the times where people definitely think that nostalgia critics either
pissing all over in floyd's point or not understanding it and i do recognize
that that exists too yes and he does that he does that and
those things are bad yes yes but it's not like that's the thing
whenever whenever you go on youtube and you say
this thing that people hate it's not actually is god-awful and terrible as
everyone just claims that it is everyone's like oh you're
being a biologist for oh you're defending it oh why are you doing that
well because i'm being consistent with this like i am for everything else
in youtube people smell blood in the water and they pounce
and they don't know why they don't know why and they can't articulate why
of but it just is it it's just bad it's just bad that's what they'll say basic
group psychology man it's basic group psychology like i said
cognitive misers our brain only has so much energy that it can
expend on having to think about stuff so it's much easier to get the headline to
get the quick and dirty of something rather than
actually have to think about it and that is we are designed that way from an
evolutionary standpoint so of course when you have a nuanced
opinion to you it seems consistent to somebody
else it seems like well that's not what group thinks
and if it's against group then it's if it's against your group and your group
is a part is a salient part of your active social identity
then when someone disagrees with you it's actually sometimes perceived as an
affront or an assault upon the person or their sense of self
that's why people go is this is this about the wall then
i'm sensing i'll i'll introduce you no it's just bad we don't have to explain
why it's just bad and terrible and if you don't think it's bad and
terrible you're being consistent hang on let me introduce you so people
actually know what the hell's going on i was going to say we
we are streaming to a whole bunch of people this is a hot topic so i want to
make sure we do this right but um this is fenner this is the one that
did the animation um with his girlfriend i believe for 17
days you say you spent in total doing uh we had 17 days to produce about
eight minutes of footage so we did our best and you wrote
the the portion of video that was filled with your animation the trial
yeah so like i said i gave i gave him a best shot and i don't
disagree with a lot of people's points and i don't mind people hating it it's
that's that's part of the game but uh yeah and so um i figure that this is a
good chance to sort of uh there's definitely an atmosphere of
of hating the wall which is fine i'm just looking to see uh if there's
anything we can address quickly while while you're here just just briefly so
um as someone who's more tied to the project
what do you think of the video overall good bad or middling i think as a review
it kind of it's not very good as a as a critical analysis of the wall
there were a lot of points that were missed by uh
doug i agree with you it doesn't really work
however as a parody i think it's pretty harmless
you know they they obviously put a bit of effort into it obviously my bit was
was done in in with good intentions i never meant it
like i said you might have noticed that my characters were sort of
advocating a bit more than they were in the rest of the review
because the wall does mean quite a bit to me personally
uh especially having my dad work on the instrumentals for the trial it was a
very personal sort of slice for us but as a whole video i'd say it
works in a lot of places doesn't work in a lot of places
and if people don't like it that's absolutely fine if people like it then
that's absolutely fine too you know what what i what i the only
issue i take is that um if you're going to criticize
something you've got to criticize it rather
saying it's bad doesn't really give me much to work on
because it's like okay well do you have do you have nine inches of rope then
because that seems to be the only so you know it's like
i i i don't know what to take or i'll say the jar podcast
when they say oh it was bad okay uh yeah that's what that's what it is
it's just bad i don't really it's just bad
for the record if it was bad then um that would just it's just just
give the old set of points with it too not to say that i hate everything didn't
make any points at all i do think that he did
i'd need to watch the video again to reference them more effectively the one
like i said that i think did the worst was probably ralph
um it's i couldn't really identify any of them
as as as name to names because i i've never really
tuned into their stuff before but um what they were saying was was a lot of
it was were pretty good points to be honest
like i i didn't find myself disagreeing but it's just when they when they when
they got to my bit it just felt a bit heavy-handed
uh a bit i don't know a bit harsh i don't mean to you know
aden mentioned it earlier it is definitely confusing for the audience if
someone was to say hey you're supposed to look at it as a tribute slash parody not
review well kind of a review too well sort of a criticism yeah it was it was
miss it was mismarketed it's kind of like i said to your last time
the audience expectation if you say this this is the scariest film ever
and it's actually the funniest film ever even if it is hilarious
um confused you're still going to be confused and disappointed
so it was mismarketed
it
but i think the fact that it it was called review
and it was sort of a parody is what threw a lot of people off
understandably so because you labeled it as a thing that it wasn't really
as much yeah and um i guess all uh the reason i brought you in was just to
to give a perspective and i'm i'm keeping an eye on chat i'm looking for
like bigger criticisms but i think you would
you would even concede that um there are certain portions of
what you would call doug's takes slash the writing and the songs that he made
that were pissing people off directly uh well
what you gotta what you gotta the thing is um i think i think english boys
really get the wall because like i said that
they grew up with with their parents and grandparents and great grandparents
telling them stories about the institutionalized abuse of
affording schools and and the war was very different from
the british perspective than the american perspective
so if you're going to have a jab at um roger waters
for writing a song about you know something that happened in his lifetime
and comparing it to modern american schools
that does not work as a criticism equally his his take on the thing with
the with the war because roger waters actually
you know lost uh a loved one just to such an event and i think it's
pretty unfair to sort of say oh throw a pair of
balls it's like yeah i mean even roger waters is even
roger waters has come out and said yeah some of this is a bit egocentric but
whatever and there's not wrong with being egocentric now and again but yeah
i think a lot of some of the points were were a bit
missed it's just when it comes to my section it's like
it's it's kind of like you know when you just kind of like when the whole
ship's sinking you're just like oh can you sing um oscar bait song i
remember i would even i was like what the fuck
oscar bait i'm guessing he's referring to um trying to come across as deep is
that is that what oscar bait means essentially
i i think a lot of people loads of like loads of the the check mark you know
like the diversity checklist and that kind of thing the
oh it's the story of a gay disabled man dealing with autism
in the second world war like that's oscar bait
it's a white downer movie it's designed to make what people feel about so they
vote for it but like yeah i find that really weird
to refer to anything in the wall is that i just
be like huh um and again these are some of these things
could just they could be whole subjects they could be whole discussions and
i think that's another flaw of the videos a lot of people said it was too long
especially when he says he makes fun of the wall for being too long and people
are like don't you see how your video is too long i was like oh i think i could
have stood to be longer with more so i think the wall was too long
oh well i meant i meant nostalgic critics video just more explaining
detail as to i don't know i guess people just wanted
more um full substance it was it was it was it was a passion project and
working on it and talking to doug uh you know in calls and you know i i know
that it was it's a passion project and he wanted to
make it because he wanted to make it and he said to me he said look a lot of
people are probably gonna hate this but it's something that i've always wanted
to make and again it's that marketing thing people
were expecting a review and uh it just wasn't that you know
yeah not only because it didn't really review but also
the parts that it did review weren't apt
you know yeah i agree with that i just um it's getting referred to as the worst
video on youtube and i was just like uh i don't really see that myself i mean
the rewind let's temper our expectations youtube rewind exists good point
it's um it seemed a bit much for me and yeah so i was curious as to looking
into all of it and then understanding the issues and i
like i said i think there absolutely are issues there 100 it's just that um
seemed a little hyperbolic that's all people
are they were extremely quick to just write it all off
as like there was nothing there and that's my problem with it
i can't just do that i i can't just do that it would not be consistent of
me or what we do on efap or any of that stuff if i said oh yeah it's just all
shit and laughed at it even though there's
stuff being said and there's criticism being made and there's
concepts that are being discussed i'm not just going to
pretend or act like those things aren't in the review
because there's a weird visual or a bad joke
or a strange visual effect going on or it looks amateurish or
any of that stuff like they all exist together and you can't just negate one
part of it and say yeah the whole thing's just shit
yeah that's um like a child's concept of criticism if you're gonna be a critic
the the key word is to to criticize and sort of base you base your points
on something of substance uh and that means looking at the good and the bad
and if you're just looking at the bad then you're doing half the job
and you're a pretty shit critic if you just look at everything that's shit
about something and i'm trying to try to be consistent you know like
liam kennedy said more that's hypocritical you often say this is a
thing that happens and that's your critique as a fool
uh the the times i think i've done that uh i do it i did it a couple times in
the predator review but when i explain that in the final
battle between the predator and the heroes that a random
alien dog walks up to them and vomits out a grenade that saves the day
when i say that i assume you can you can understand the issue
if not i still go over it in like the summary portion but my videos are
typically like an hour long and so it's not just me saying what
happens i'll never just do that it'll usually be
a stake so it's like there you go you know that now and then later on i'll
usually explain how it falls into a category of bad like
it's extremely convenient that that happened especially in the end of the
film while with like ralph's video and it is it looks to be like um
a reaction video so you could argue what's wrong with him just laughing
i'd be like oh i just i just think as criticism goes it's worthless
yeah i mean
it's all in good fun though isn't it i'm i'm more invested in the discussion
than mostly everything else so i just uh
more curious just to talk about it and you know a lot of people are like oh
this will destroy nostalgic critic's career and i was like i i think he's
already fine no this next video is doing great yeah i
mean at the end of the day you know people say oh he's taken the
war too seriously fuck me people are taking this like like
like he's just murdered 15 people with a fucking
you know she's just talking like he's just shot some girl down in a turnip
you know it's it's a review of a film that it maybe a lot of people don't like
or even hate but jesus and to the the top position i
imagine on the opposite end would be that this is this is the wall meant a
lot to somebody and then they have this guy
who gets hundreds thousands of views talking about how it's it's oscar bait
it's too long it's it's boring and it and it's uh
self-obsessed or something they could be very fucking upset and i wouldn't
actually blame them i'd just be more interested in seeing
those videos that explain it in that way instead of going
oh my god it's so bad like okay yeah i just as someone who worked on the video
i would very if someone says to me oh yeah
um your character you know your characters are over-designed it's like
but they've only got like two maybe three colors
and it's like can i get bit but no just don't like okay so it's like
from from one of the people working on the video it's kind of frustrating to
have people say oh this is bad why is it bad it just is
okay well i can't take criticism uh fucking it's like right
it's just a sort of confusing process there's got to be some form of exchange
here surely if i'm going to produce content
and you're going to critique it surely there must be some form of
effort in the sort of you know exchanging of content if i'm you know
tell me what you didn't like please and if you make a good point i'll agree
with it and that's that's pretty much it i just
wanted to bring you on just to hear that maybe
there'll be something going forward i don't know uh
like like more videos to come out more debates to happen about this thing but
that's pretty much what you could call efap's take on it
we're not we're pretty middle of the road about it all um yeah i don't care
about the wall really i just i don't care that could be
what people would reference as the problem they'd be like you're not
invested enough in the wall so that's why i didn't bother you and it's like
okay oh like good that means i could try to be as objective as possible about it
i was gonna say fenna you really like the wall so
right i do like the wall yeah but in in yeah
it's not like yellow submarine where it's sort of like they took
music and added that i'd adapted it into its own little thing it is sort of like
a really long music video but i'm not going to deny that
what's there is is great the music the visuals there's
nothing wrong with it it's just you know yeah that's why i don't think we could
do like a review of the wall it's it's just
it's it's it's so conceptual in that kind of way
that it doesn't have the same kind of a structure
or scripting that a typical film would have
and i don't know how i would really take on the wall itself
i think you could review it the way that you review a and this is actually a
really interesting point that got brought up a while ago
um which is that you would have to probably look at it as a performance
of a piece as as like so like if it's jesus christ superstar or cats or
whatever you would have to be looking at the film
representation as the performance of this piece so then you can say like
there are these flaws in this performance this specific
adaptation not necessarily with the music itself or with the
play itself but it would have to be a because people do that all the time
reviewers do say this specific performance of cats
which will certainly be very interesting soon
but um is is good or bad for these reasons and you can do that on very
objective you know guidelines versus what i
think happened is because there was the integration of the
it being a parody of it being an homage of it being
a review and critical all at the same time it made it too confusing
to understand what was going on it would have been probably more concise to
just make it a review of this performance yeah i know that certainly
when we watched the wall we were able to take the things
that were in doug's video you're like oh okay
that's what he was doing there okay doug was wrong here and
doug was wrong here about this and this is where he gets this
idea from and there was a part where um in doug's video he has the whole
section of the guy sitting in front of the tv falling
asleep and being bored and i think both maller and i were like
oh yeah that's why he had that in because we're both kind of like okay
we're kind of getting bored here it's like it's like there's there's
connections to be made um and it certainly recontextualized a lot
of stuff when i when we watched the wall but
ultimately i thought doug's video was more entertaining
so there you'll be crucified crucified yeah that's right
that's right now at least i don't need to worry about being the subjective the
attention now i thought doug's video was more
entertaining than the wall there you go there there's your hot take
and i'll stand oh and that's subjective so there ain't a damn
thing you can do about it they can still judge
let them let them judge see it's interesting because as someone who
worked on the review i would actually disagree with that but
it's just the sort of thing that happens isn't it
well yeah oh yeah i know i can see why people like the wall a lot
i i definitely see it um there were parts that i really really liked
i thought the wall i i liked it more towards the beginning i i like the
the kid loose and his father and the mother stuff it was like i
like that i like that part the animations were really good
um i don't know the names of the songs so forgive me if i if i don't know the
names of the songs but they had the the the representation of the black eagle
as the luftwaffe picking up cities and things like that like i i really like
that i thought that was really cool really creative
now would you agree with me in my in my section of the review
i had lucy say oh they should have you know they should have used it far more
often in reference to the fact that the animated sequences were the strongest
parts of the film now they were yes yeah i would right now by good
when when mauler and i were watching it we both
pretty much felt that there was a lot of sections
where there were live action sections for the most part
that just dragged on i feel for a lot longer than was needed
and it's already an hour and a half so we were saying man if they
if they cut down and condensed a lot of that part that just seemed really
filery and repetitive and instead gave more time to the animated sections
that were really really well done and well directed and
had really good you know metaphorical stuff happening i think it would be
better overall in my lyrics when that big creature
says we're bored of alice we want the hatter you know that's
that's what i was referring to the animated sections of the film
oh well okay it's all shit because it's animated and it's weird
any of the lyrics that you have i were just gonna ignore him don't talk about
him yeah so a lot of people say to me yeah
but what did this have to do with the with the wall and i was and i'm like
but what does any critic have to do with anything they're reviewing the point is
to sort of i mean what what do you mean what does this have to do with the ball
it's clearly a musical parody of of the sequence
ask so it confuses me but i don't know i i find it i definitely well
well exploring all this i understand from different sources i looked
into i found more more insight and threads
and the comment section than i did in the video reviews um but i get the
the issues i do i understand it makes sense to me
um i just think the worst video on youtube was a bit
hyperbolic that's all and we we all have to try it maybe say that for
the actual worst videos on youtube maybe what are the worst videos on youtube i
know yeah i'm fucking curious now as well that jayexy guy makes some pretty bad
ones yeah if we had to make a list of the
worst videos on that's tough i would say well it depends on how you
want to come up with worse do you mean it to be like nonsensical
or just oh like let's put it this way um is
jared's review of the last jedi or the force awakens worse than the wall
review oh yeah and for clarification me and rags
well i i don't think rags had spoken to him just yet but i spoke to
uh cj for like haven't talked to him yet yeah i spoke to him for like three hours
and he's someone who hated the wall video sorry the nostalgic
critic video and he said that it was the problem i think he said it is the worst
video review on youtube and so all i did was look for insight i was just asking
him all kinds of questions about what what was fucked up about the video and
this is where i'm at after it and i think i think his mind changed after
i was like talking about the script with him and just talking about uh different
parts obviously he's not here to speak for
himself so i don't want to say too much but um
he was ranting at the wait when was this before last night because
it was before you're streaming i talked to him last night where he was like
he was ranting about how bad the video is i'm not sure if he said it's the
worst on youtube but he was like he was still like really really angry
about it oh yeah he definitely still thinks it's
bad and i don't think i don't have a problem with that i'm not angry but like
really i guess you know what i'm trying to say is that i
got to speak to him and he's someone who um
loves the wall hates the video so it's not like i've not heard uh what's
what's wrong with was that the guy i spoke to yes
okay yeah he was talking yeah it was it was just that's the kind of stuff i was
looking for just um you know uh i think that a video
with like doug and you versus him and and maybe even i hit everything that
could be more insightful than any of the reviews
just because there's a lot of misunderstanding but um
and i'm not trying to say that i mean misunderstanding on both ends of people
who like and dislike i think a lot of people who liked
nostalgic critics video might not even be able to say why
because uh i think a lot of people are lost on a lot of the lyrics
there's a lot going on so it it will definitely be difficult to process i
know we miss stuff because there's so much happening at once
that's why i mean we we got the script and mauler read out parts of the script
and we talked about the things that were said in the script
it's like oh there's stuff here shame that
seems that a lot of people are just just ignoring it
like it there's not even words being spoken here
yeah that's about it i didn't want to uh go any further with it really
so um thanks thanks for popping on and like i said we'll we'll definitely have
you for any fap at some point i just wanted to
let people know that you're aware of of the criticisms as well
that you you're around that is is there's discussion happening and it's
um yeah it's like whatever i'm gonna go and commit
sudoku now because obviously oh oh and by the way if i say people say
this and you're not one of those people guess what i'm not fucking talking
about you now am i
all right well i'll see you around take it easy right yeah man i'll catch you
goodbye goodbye bye
like i said i found it all very interesting and i'd love to talk to uh i
had everything about it i don't know if he'd be up for that though
um he hasn't spoken to me for a long time
but um i'll try regardless the people who thinks you're a big bad
i can't i don't know if he thinks i'm a big bad currently he might do
um and obviously we'll probably address more of this in the intro of the next
dfap because i have a feeling we've just uh
this goes further than sputum and all godzilla rags this is probably
one of them one of them big we we did a bad
but we'll be able to address whatever arguments come up we did a bad because
yeah yeah because we we we didn't declare outright that it was the most
terrible thing and we actually tried to learn about what was being
said yeah fuck us well i i saw someone already said in um
my discord that uh we're not bringing up any
of the cogent arguments the robot people who don't like it i thought i did
already we literally have though like we we
literally have we admit multiple times in the stream that doug is just flat out
wrong about some stuff in the wall like he was just flat out wrong about
some stuff like where he's like i'm also what i would rate his video
as a whole it's kind of tough to say yeah that's why we've been saying it's a
huge mix of good and bad like the the section in his uh in his
review where he's got the cloud that says my problems
and it destroys everyone else's problems like the whole point of the wall was
about oh how pink's problems are the only problems that matter and no one
else has issues like no that no doug that's entirely inaccurate
there's no way that the wall is actually saying that you just got this one wrong
in his video he says like you're comparing war with like school and
stuff like that it's like yeah you can do that
a lot of uh comparisons a child could make from their perspective about
the hardships of different things and how the war connects to and influences
the the life of children in britain at that age
time i mean chat chat's pressing q for quinton
okay fine right so anyway oh there you go we're still not quite done
with with what you could call the intro but don't worry chat you'll like this
next bit so uh here is an invite to the watch
together everybody if you just jump in um if you
remember some efaps ago we covered a wonderful man named the closer look
and um i found this compilation i thought was really funny that you guys
uh is um is anybody not in the wash together
hey one second i have to slow it up just probably more
i was gonna say like you know um i've i was i was here for the promise of
memes oh and this is kind of me for a while
uh on something that you know like i have no
insight on whatsoever that wasn't necessarily intended it's just what am
i supposed to do jay kick me kick you i can't do that we're
about to do memes actually well now i can't do memes because
chat's gonna be upset at me if i do memes before quinton so
i guess how long you free for jay um i'm free for a while all right then
anyway uh if everyone's here right so this like i said
mr mr closer look was often describing things
in with certain words and i guess someone made made a compilation
bless the heart and um that is i guess i'll show you guys so here we go epic
epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic epic truly epic epic epic epic
epic epic epic epic bone shit hope dread hope dread hope dread even
more dread gush of hope another gush of hope
yet another gush of hope this is another great gush of hope
really epic epic epic epic epic unquestionably epic i mean i'm a 22 year
old with limited writing experience living in my mum's house i am no
expert if you ask me this film really would have benefited from the russo
spending more time learning about creative writing anyway
oh no celestial apex massive i'm a celestial apex massive
well played person who made that video um which leaves us yeah so i guess if i
should leave this up to chat or not we have i i i i guess for the sake of aidin
we should probably jump into a video instead of memes
i just um i you can do whatever man memes could take a while and you have a
lot of non-context forms i wouldn't want to
ruin your time especially with um i hope you don't feel like you're a little bit
lost on that wall discussion it's just that
everyone wanted to know i mean i i i i listened to the jar review i watched
the oh yeah but i i just don't have strong up
because again to me my only takeaway from it was this seems like an average
doug walker video to me yes actually yeah it is kind of
because i've never really been a fan always um
skits and the even i'm not even a huge fan of his voice as weird as that sounds
it always seems a little high up and too excited that was like oh
it's like bugs bunny epic epic um but hey it's not like impossible to
listen to him i i i find it fine sometimes i guess you could say hit and
miss um i guess he never knows sorry i was
distracted by jay's post there why why have you got that we have a couple
memes and the sea of that's gonna that's gonna feature in a
video of mine soon um i refuse to give context
all right well you know i made it a while ago for a video and it's been
setting my desk ever since you can do some i can do some picture
memes real quick how about that do some quick
okay okay do whatever makes you happy we got
look we got so many people requesting memes i can't i can't like i can't look
at that it's tearing me up what am i supposed to do
got um history book hands principles of massives
um i don't think it's real personally but uh i'd like i don't think so either
excellent i feel like we're being bamboozled
yeah got the good rats uh they've been found again uh aden i
wonder how much you're gonna be lost on this
but it's the 40k thing no it's well no actually it's it's a brown table thing
as much as that does that makes i was actually gonna
yeah he at the beginning of a new video jay made me aware of this
brown table says um why am i talking about this video joker is coming out and
jay's convinced us an efap reference it is an efap it's absolutely an efap
reference it is for us but for him that could
actually be him referencing himself is that a motherfucking efap reference i don't know
i'd like to believe um also so someone was watching my
uh my game of thrones videos and an ad for the game of thrones game was on it
let's just jay jason a video on how bad that game is really good
it's not really great game don't lie to the people i'm really irritated that it's
installed on your phone and you can't uninstall it
what is in the game of thrones game it's installing it comes pre-installed
on um android phones and you cannot uninstall it
uh i guess so dumb that's terrible if you're if you go through atnt at least
you have to literally drop atnt as a service and
go to another service to get rid of it it's like it's the worst game
like but i had to uninstall it five times from my computer and like the
fifth time i had to get help because every time i like
uninstalled it and like deleted all the files attached what i could find
the next time i booted up my pc it would be back
yeah that i'm aware of they they they're like a little parasite
it is it's a parasite it's do you remember when you input this into your
calculator x i guess someone managed to find a photo of it
yeah i have uh i have a analysis calculator
and i just type in what i need to get whatever i want to have
it's great what's that i can't remember which efab it was but i think it was
you right it's a celestial harassment celestial harassment is never okay every
female of the galaxy i don't know who will be orchestrated by i guess
celestial could be uh like um like marvel where celestials are actual
being this is a stick like weapon yeah by his
definition why not that's got a stick on the front yeah
stick like thing on the front yeah um me and the boys when we
crack down the informant who knows what makes good rat
the never-ending uh journey to find good rat
man good rat that meme is uh that one's sticking around
i don't know how it just is um this is a highly underrated meme pizza
time pizza time oh very nice
because he likes pizza he does uh a nice little piece of history
for you guys uh the leader of the evil men who ask
why you like things
or or even worse you ask people why they don't like things
oh no that's actually what hitler did now he's just like
so why do you like this why do you like the juice
i'm mutually
i guess they're trying to say that with rtx on a stream
improves the point of being the goliath chronicles that was a pretty great
stream the memorable one it came out of nowhere
that was that was a stream i was playing
Jurassic world evolution while we were in that stream it was fun
i remember that's not allowed
so the trouble began other things a damn smile do you know what that's a
reference to what film because i don't think i've seen it
uh yeah it's captain marvel that's the dawn character
in captain marvel uh what about the other three
oh i don't know i kind of remember the name of the movie i do know it but oh
god it's giving me it's it's not a good movie
it makes me assume it's one of those like people are saying 13 reasons why
oh you know i feel like we've been yeah it could be we've probably been told
that but we used it for the rags handsome face
and it was very funny i get i'm probably yeah
oh no
is this borderlands 3 i don't know i could be any of them to be honest with
you so i can't remember they kind of look the same too
which is you know how does the game look it looks terrible
it's they try to do the um uh they're doing that
stylized shading no no no no it looks it looks
bad maybe it's on console or something
maybe i don't think i may have shown this one before but it's still a
classic i have
an olive is a rude grave
i like that the old memes are still getting their reasonable amount of
attention oh yeah
the dawn being possibly one of the strongest memes
he is possibly one of the strongest memes we've ever had forcibly
oh by the way yes chat i know you can get it on pc on the epic game store
but it looks so bad that i just assumed it was on console running there
so um i like that i have the dawn in um
around my neck it's suitable it's wonderful and more renditions of me in
alternate universes i suppose all this one depends on what i get to
my own time being bong your opinion is wrong
what's it what's that guy in the back there's a guy in the back right
that markiplier who is that i gotta zoom in yeah it's markiplier
it looks like markiplier 100% sure why i like this why is markiplier there
you gotta i fucking hate shrub quitted reviews four out of ted i guess
quitted reviews watch this world he wasn't happy with it
he did not like mauler cop he gave it a four out of ten
ever ending sandwing film sensors that were rated pg
but also 18 i want to see this movie
alan it's all middle look there's no ends
this is uh it's pretty clever meme god why doesn't the resistance use y-wings
i don't even know what those that is crazy though though what a what a
ridiculous thing to say yeah it's like it's not even that it's not
even like the let's assume that like a lot of people
didn't know what y-wings are right his argument is literally just
no it's not a problem because some people are ignorant
cool thanks man good argument people don't know what established things are
so we'll add new things that make less sense
that'll be it'll help all right uh trying to work out how the fuck do you
do an emmy hey man it doesn't have to make sense
okay we should put less stock in emmys and
oscars that's probably the way out of that that's like
yeah imagine already having an emmy and then you see that and you're like oh
this is worthless yeah now now i know that my emmy is
equal to dnd game of thrones season eight
just throw in the trash melt it down make a toilet yeah just
yeah exactly yeah melt it down totally worth more just raw materials
i think there's more than one of these that was funny this is uh this is a deep
deep meme so i'm not i'm not mexican martha in real
life guys you'll know this thing from the uh
oh no the t-shirt stream that was a great stream mexican halloween
oh mexican halloween was great if you want to know the reference to this
meme it's it's the extended universe part two
uh as as deep as the lore goes now
another movie with us in this yeah that's the uh that's that's like the
disney channel or whatever play movie quick play hack
or something
i am beautiful the closer look we should take avengers end game
and put it into helms deep
helms deep's great it is great
i've been having to rewatch it while i've been editing
the rendition of goliath i think sea goliath oh my goodness
sea goliath that is terrifying
i don't believe there are people out there they've spent more than
1.2 we're excited
this is really good he put eyes and a mouth on everyone he made you squint
oh you're all bloody now well i was bloody before
bloody at all of them were you oh yeah i got i got blood on the other panels
well i yeah but i i didn't know that you had blood
over you oh well i don't tell you about my day-to-day
what where's that blood you know don't don't tell me i'd rather not know but
this is a really good meme i really like this meme
hey what you say hack memes and also yes chat that the movie is called
rags rag is um one of them long women i've heard
about i see a lot of them
i guess well it's like it wait does does is there always blood on
that profile picture because it's always cut off at the neck so
i never that vision does the vision i'm currently using oh okay i i didn't know
that other vision i'm not as familiar with that one this one
mixture the dankwame that's just a funny sounding word
here's another shad one
that's good that was funny when he said that yeah
uh the ending of the odyssey is not epic enough because the premise is only
about odysseus' marriage i think we really have to take it
seriously i mean if we really have the great philosophers
yeah big idiots have you ever studied anything from big idiots yeah
you know what uh i i'm more in the psychology fields and philosophy but i
have heard of big idiots yeah i know that he is he's very
influential among the greats
the fact that we just say big idiots naturally
help me because that's the text one i love this one fans of big idiots
the freudian and pupil big idiots are the first in history to engage in debate
on the trap question oh yeah chat's asking us to tell aiden
about if she knows about freudian oh yeah so you know the when someone
says a freudian slip they're referring to the
to the guy freudian right not not freud because i would be
fucked up mistake his name is freudian oh of course yeah we may or may not have
had who even i've never heard of this man
i mean everyone knows freudian we may or may not have had a guest who
was convinced it was freudian and uh we let them run with it
for a few seconds before oh no so so now we have freudian and
big idiots they are two very um galaxy-brained individuals
and i believe um i you know i really feel like a
normal woman gods here with this kind of advanced intellectualism
i'm not sure how i think it'd be wanna should we read this out i'll do
i'll do the the gray and you do the blue rags are you gonna be freudian
and i'll be okay i'll do okay you can be freudian
i'll be big idiots dearest pupil i beseech thee to abandon these explorations
unto massively the gods erected boy kind to please girl
kind not thine tireless phallus considered this honored mentor if it
were a lad of most effete beauty and the room were dark
would it truly be queenly to mount hymnic
imagine if you will the shadow of a youth cast on a wall in silhouette
the groin has yet obscured as stimulating as i find such
theoretical the ancient wisdom remains unchanged
if the balls do not come in contact as a man partaken
in the big gay but my master are you not
in an effable champion of the subjective naturity
of existence if all about us is but a mirage of our senses
then surely the big gay too is up to interpretation
the world of our senses is surely subjective never doubt that fair
big idiots but within the framework of what our
eyes and pains do tell us your summertime fling
had a manhood beneath her stola you ought to confess to your wife oh pupil
leave big titties out of this if you
big titties big big titties
no i i will say shouldn't froyd froydian and
big idiots be swapped because froyd is on playto
wait i forget which one's which one of those is playto
in which one of those no air saddles on the left right
i don't know this picture and playto's on the right here
oh um the it's it's the academy um
i think
um
i think i forget which is on the left way to left
Aristotle right okay all right rags needed his meme and then we go
from that to this meme which is just a wonder
oh yeah that's great i'm saving it
it's literally what it is though he's killing it
such a stupid bee but i love it
yeah
um this this one's good for uh if you if you'd like to read out the top bit rags
this is the process right that uh he went through when making the video i guess
okay my fellow female workers and other girls
liked tlj and experiences awful treatment and hate on the internet from so many nerdy guys
they are attacking the film they are calling people who liked it names i've heard some tran
even deleted their instagram it reminds me times when i like the prequels when i was little boy
and so many people called me stupid and hated me for liking spaceships and lightsabers
okay i'm gonna make a video and address it and ask people to be nicer and do not ruin others
uh other people's enjoyment
the men are ruining souls that's the conclusion he makes through that
gonna press extra doubt on the backstory but
good old that yeah he didn't do a good job
i'm just gonna find the dawn's daily i can't imagine the pleasure it is to
going to eat orphans eat for free yeah absolutely i think this was a reference to when
you know it was a wolf who wanted to to infinity snap half of people all the people he said
they were stupid i can't remember um but either way sounds like a wolf quote um i like i've got
my little wolf badge as well i like that i'm horny important um don't forget this as well
i guess this is just a deleted scene from empire like shitty movies you messed
that's my best yoda that's all i got it's okay that was a good yoda that was pretty good i think
it's funny because i could see that being in the room as a quote that's a that's a real
quote by the way aden i don't know if you knew that just because it's bad doesn't mean it's bad
uh wait wait um it was the bat from anastasia who gave this review
oh my god oh oh what's his name uh don't tell me oh the bat from anastasia his name was um
um oh bar talk bar talk yeah bar talk oh god what a great movie what a great that's just what makes
good bat bar talk i mean that's just uh that's just words of wisdom right there you know wisdom
stuff than e at the end just because it's bad doesn't mean it's bad jesus fuck that he he wrote
it out and then he said it and he came and i i the empire one might be a reference to the
racist empire by the way uh once i didn't chat that might be true oh yeah we have a lot of
memes to catalog you know very realistic i feel like there might be like this could be like hello
grito even with with that stream raid right people were sending hello grito the efap memes
in the chat and he was completely unaware of their context you saying it was funny huh he
thinks a massive means like he looked up massive on urban dictionary and the first thing it was
like it's jamaican slang for and he's like you're saying i'm jamaican that's like my favorite
quote from that whole thing uh good that's weird because oh yeah massive people group collective
jamaican origin all the massive dim love reggae music i mean i wasn't aware of that but sure he's
jamaican hey i love the idea that um hello grito can be under the impression that someone might
think he is jamaican yeah it would make sense stormtroopers he's got to fail hands i like how
he uses a webcam while he's streaming but he wears the helmet yeah it's like it's oh i need a webcam
so people can see my face but i don't want people seeing my face they can see his room see that's
good enough this is what i look like just like the videos i got these pink lights so that people
could see how nice my room is like so people can observe how the light bounces off my mask i like
that everyone has rhino rhino milk badges even the atst type thing i don't know what fiction this is
you know warhammer there you go is there the imperial guards uh fighting off the tyrannids
um not fighting what we hate i feel like this was made like unironically
by someone who really liked it does look unironic yeah yeah that does look like it could be a tumblr
post and yet it works i don't want to i don't want to see the rule of 34 though
why would you know it more but curiosity into my brain rags you know it exists
you know it's out there it's definitely real rags is proud of myself is like i know warhammer
sort of i'm getting a punishment from chat for not knowing i feels bad man i don't know i'm sorry
um well a lot of people if there's that they don't see a space marine in it they're like oh i
don't know what that is yeah uh tide does remove shit out of your clothes it's a very good oh god
um imagine if tide actually ran this ad
she did it all right
this this is one of those pictures that if you show someone with no context of e-fat would be like
what in the world can all of this mean not this means anything the masses like i don't understand
1.2 billion percent this would do all right in surreal memes
surreal memes right now it is the most meme it's nonsensical oh yeah so the where we were looking
at these um i can't remember if it was rags or shad or whoever else suggested i should have a
a long weapon so we changed it to a um well i don't actually what is the name of something
a weapon like this that is a nagginata there you go i call it a staff knife
a sword staff or whatever you want to call it just call it carl fucking shout out the video
about those kinds of weapons does he know yeah i i i get i'm a signal yes um this was like a
strange 3d rendition of me in some kind of software i have no idea but i thought it was
oh my goodness i can imagine aggressively t posing at you that's horrifying i thought
this was pretty funny the shadow the shadow makes it really creepy yeah we uh we had this meme for
movie bob having killed all the different guests and hosts being rags still haven't been admitted
by movie bob yet but now it's me killing those different pieces of content how very friendly
movie bob's like a supernatural force he's not even human no he's one of like the fundamental
forces of the universe like it could be a glove yeah depends what you want to call it it's
probably named a lot of things yeah i feel like that super cut may or may not happen just the
whole thing it was tons of fun mixed in with all the most horrible bits of
novels yeah including heinz solo screaming in pain he sat himself up uh poorly for that one
i like this drawing
we've got like a jacket trench coat suit
that is a long trench coat and it was i think there's a rags vision we'll we'll find it oh god
yeah the four panel one oh it's it's amazing you tried to make that hideous creature not hideous
yeah it's like an attempt at the cutest possible vision of the creepy fart balloon monster so yeah
no i like it the creepy fart balloon monster it it has a real name in the wiki but it's just a
creepy fucking fart monster this is um i think i mentioned on one of the podcasts how it probably
would have been better if ray was like had to struggle like crazy to save everybody from
the fallen rocks in hanging in and the guy said he drew this um as a sort of vision of it and i
thought it was pretty cool why why is she bruised in her head that's my like i understand why it
would be a nosebleed right uh does she have a wound in her head was there originally i can't
remember no that would be a flaw oh shit sorry yeah um how would you forget obviously it would
be tough if you had this moment in the film as it stands it might be strange because the whole film
doesn't thoroughly match it but obviously i'd be advocating for changing pretty much every
you know the force has never been shown to work like that though it's never been like you know
that's like definitely struggles to use the force you can you could totally get a nosebleed though
like yeah you can totally add it physical repress or something before
add it in why not add it in uh i would like to point out that i am i am the most massive
it's true so he enjoyed it now massive i like the pipeman is uh there's all the naysayers i'm
about to lose this game of agar.io oh no let let it be said that i'm the most massive well
it wasn't pipeman is pretty massive though he's just like pretty massive i'm assuming that's the
pipeman's massiveness yeah he was still still a star on me um because you tried
so this is more from um the guy who made that 3d one i think and this is like a 3d rendition of
the whole so you're watching
i think i've got an image for that what are those i honestly i don't know what the program is exactly
are those hands oh they're hands yeah yeah it's that little cartoon character suddenly you're
a nazi all of a sudden you're a mess you're a nazi you're a massive i'm watching tv this
like wasteland it's like that's that's my thing that's what i do i like my little shoes as well
just me and my tv it's like uh the wall it's just you and your little tv yes um
a rendition of of what makes good rat i like to think that um pizza apparently can take you
away from the standings but isn't it worth it for pizza that's fat rat
and it's a few feet of rat loads of pizza it's probably gonna get pretty big
yeah probably well the one up there seems very stylish wonderful
this is like a sketch that was drawn then it was like finalized i just thought it was kind of
really uh final vision let's see the clock it's so much
oh god the color almost becomes partially surreal toward the end there
oh yeah this was the the rags one i should have put them side by side at my soul
bark very stylish their ranks ready for the uh the court now you know how a dog wears a
wears a suit yeah that's the answer so this was made i think right after you have
42 was it got um got got taken down by thingy like this sad moment where
realize that it's available but it did come back it rose from the dead
um yeah it was never really gone
um
you have a celestial cute little as droids
it's a closer look to definitely add a lot to the
important it's important to understand the kabonger as wielded by el kabong was not a sword
like weapon happen may not believe things about old weapons on shadow versity now
can you stop date his sword like weapon alice apparently this one's for j
i don't know if you've seen this before j top 10 sword like weapons i'm excited it's like number seven
oh i do get that that's a good meme well done want to explain it to us that's a
character from steven universe that can tell the future and they've drawn her as a spider
ah wonderfully clean i like it and there's only a couple more left
it calls toxic brooding it brings a smile to every orphan's face that
i feel like i've we've helped push that forward with the um the milk carton in um the game of
thrones review wonderfully drawn by sanic snacks it was it was might even say it was good rat
the episode of efans is brought to you by the letter six and the number p
i like all the different versions of me i love it i like to believe i i i can be in every medium
no matter how massive i think you suit a big pink hoodie in that in that picture what about this one
that's uh scary on i like that but it's like an actual mass yeah i know the straps on it i like
that it's creepy though it is that's the mask that you take off to reveal your other mask
oh would this one be under the current one i don't know you need a double mask i think
everyone can agree with that this is the middle mask also someone just sent me this meme so
let's see if i can get that up on here this they call me the dawn so dawn was under the spiderman
mask the whole time it was never made away that spider suit makes them look really very slimming
oh oh i don't even remember where i got this wrong but it's wonderful
oh yeah sad sad arounds yeah that makes me sad just looking at it
guessing something happened to the dawn that's the only thing i can picture for this
it's me sad that people are not being consistent about
another red edition of myself in a different style once again it's fucking awesome oh that's
long very long oh yeah that's that's the long drawing like my pc face at the top
oh yeah
i've upset somebody and then i think i might have shown these ones last time i really can't remember
but they're still cool so that's good got that one and then he uh changed it up with uh
oh that's really nifty is his very nifty ass um that's uh oh i wait oh yeah this is um omega
ridley uh who actually did the uh the thumbnails for the moolah channel he's got the long van then
still over here you want to do that tfa part three and beyond
don't trust the long van i never know what it's gonna do um but yes so that's a whole bunch of
memes um there's a couple videos but i think we'll we'll try and save them for um a little later as
they as they say uh which means in typical efap fashion that was uh what you could call a one hour
50 minute intro that makes sense is that how long it's been on our 50 intro yeah there there's
efap for you now now everyone wants uh everyone's saying it's quinton time i guess it's quinton
time it's quinton time as in not to be confused with quinton time no no no a very different thing
very different oh yeah it's like it's brain quinton time because it's quinton time so um
oh let me pause that so yeah the context here is that me rags i want to say fringy and wolf uh
covered this more than a year ago um it's been so long and it was never covered on efap even
though we sometimes reference some of the things in it i've mostly forgotten it so it's gonna be
fun we got that tied to the fact that you have a wonderful guest who uh is probably more than
interested in some commentary on on quinton everyone's like excited that it's quinton time
i don't know i don't know what to say about this it's quinton time because because a train wreck
is fun you know quinton tim marendino fun to watch not to be in exactly i wouldn't want to be in
quinton you can't fire me i quit quint phrasing why is it's off center efap what are you doing to
me why is this happening have you you fucked it up how how how how everything is normal destroyed
efap you've destroyed art well is it really my fault if if i don't know how it happened
playing to me uh yes well no that's irrelevant it may or may not be your fault regardless of
whether or not you know how it happened well then i guess i'll have to fix it while delaying
us playing the video so i'm just going to talk about nothing for a little bit and hope that you
help with that oh my god you're ruining the magic keep going i'm doing it's all your fault
ah magic it's going it's ah is the magic restored i feel like the magic is restored
no now that we've seen how it's done the magic can never truly be i'm so sorry the magic has
been stalled and then restored and then ruined um all right is everybody ready to watch this
uh miracle grace to you nope i need to use the loo i'll be back in just a minute
he couldn't have gone to loo while i was stalling could he now we're gonna have to stall again uh
j how was your day good someone just asked me if i've seen the season six trailer for bojack
horseman and i haven't so that's that did you i feel like i asked this before winton made a
video on the latest season of dr who right did you ever watch that what was that like i did i
started that video um i think i got so far as him disavowing people who would like just disliking it
based on the fact that it had uh minorities in it and then i couldn't be bothered to watch yeah
i i think i that's about where i got in it as well but it's been months um and it it's funny
i did do a video about him yeah but i i have a video about the not the most recent season of
dr who but a couple of seasons ago just when i realized like they just didn't care anymore
um and that was why i started watching quinton's channel by the way is because i i'm a big fan of
dr who and he has he has a good dr who reviews exactly and then it became obviously a different
direction in the channel which is bizarre to me but i find that interesting from a
people watching social science psychology standpoint more than anything of whoa what happened here
yeah he he's he's changed a lot from uh i used to watch him when he just did doctor who stuff
i thought it was yes fun you both fans are dr who yes you both love the newest season why
yeah it's oh i love it really great you know uh i should have brought it up while he was here
um was talking to me about dr who a little bit and he said that um as much as there's some things
that are a little bit silly and the newest one you have to admit that when the dalek
fought the army it was fucking badass no you don't um yeah i was like oh you should talk to jay that
could be fun um hang on hang on hang on you've seen that you've seen that i've seen the fucking
slow motion missile deflecting off a tank bullet yep and then it like does swooshy camera
movements and then the dalek flies away from an explosion hey man let's also i would just say
let's also just talk about like what kind of level do you have to move all of the goalposts
when you're saying the best thing about dr who is a battle and special effects yeah oh yeah
yeah whoa is that a 180 from everything that show has ever been or been about
i should i'll set that up sometime when fenna when fenna gets violence i'll bring you on jay
right i show this famous with non-violence and special and having like famously bad special
effects that it was just it was just well known for the merits of its writing
yes the writing's what makes dr who good and it's why you can tolerate
and find actually charming the flaws in the production um but when if someone's telling
me that oh man you got to see the new episode of dr who because the special effects are great
i think i'll pass that's if that's your point i'd just rather they went and like touched up old
episodes with like the new effects that they have that would be so much like such a better
use of that money than like making chibnall's episodes happen like he only to be fair he's
only destroyed two characters but he only tried to bring back two characters so far
oh that's how it's all just well i mean they're perfectly balanced perfect record yep how long
until you make that video right if people say rags are slow here like no i've been back
my target is to finish it before uh season 12 comes out um other than that like i don't know
i just want to i want to get it done so there's not more to talk about when i release it uh-huh
no say uh i can make you fat be mad at you for not getting the dose of us watching thingy until
you allow it to be released blame you we re-watched it yesterday and it was hilarious i showed right
um i'm not gonna lie i think it's one of my finest i was uh i was gonna say j the link i
would have given you is older now unless you had downloaded already but uh youtube actually said
hey copyright and i have to re-upload again oh fun i think i've downloaded well i mean i was
gonna say i can just give you the new link anyway new link actually has the new version of efab
movies where rags logically suggested to reduce the opacity of the cover so you can still kind
of see the episode slash thing we're covering yeah even when the logo pops up you can see this
stuff it looks it works really really well yeah i i get a gonna pat myself for that one that's uh
that idea works really well it looks great and i think it worked the first time you tried it right
yeah i was really surprised actually i i just figured that the system wouldn't let you do that
like of course they were telling us to get to quinton chat efap is not known to be punctual
i mean well we are punctual technically but we're sort of punctual not speedy when it comes to we
don't want to get through things quickly we want to we want to cover everything in the way that it
we're gonna savor the middle that's all people want is just a bunch of middle and that's what
this is speaking of which someone's alerted me on twitter they want you to see this j
oh that's crazy good yeah holy shit well go on my twitter and look at the i look really unhappy but
i like it well you watch dr who that could be that has to be watching dr who this is me
i'm just gonna wipe out these these extra episode related meme that's really good though
i love to fan oh yeah that's awesome that's fucking awesome there's a lot going on in this
meme um hate women like me no thought only feeling get out of your echo chamber and face me with
what am i what am i holding there looks like is that that fringy because of the nose i'm thinking
toss them out the window i think i've said that at some point is that just that reminds me of the
plasma gun from doom yes uh the bfg one from the film i guess also i told yeah the film like a bfd
the film the amazing film yeah it will they will see our coverage of that of it doom was more
entertaining than the wall that's not fair the room is more entertaining than loads of things
i know
there's so many aggressive people in chat right now like cover quinton god damn it's like we're
getting a nice way okay look at this this exists how to be massive funny affectionate and very very
sharp this book is well massive how to be massive how to be massive we should buy it that's a podcast
it should be the podcast book um so this is toxic at bc root i mean it's not like nostalgia critic
wasn't uh there was fair criticism aimed at him but i was just i'm just showcasing me
i mean a lot of people liked his video it was it had 50 50 right it wasn't like the extra credits
video where it was like 95 hated it that was like 50 50 yeah i thought the video was kind of 50 50
so and there you go perfect one to end on it's quinton time it's quinton time all right chat
here we go here we go go hats hats you said it would be a few me sorry don't touch me sorry
there's too many memes all right is everyone ready um i already used the bathroom so i think we're
good all right jay you you locked in is it engaged be sure to deflate your shoes and make sure you're
buckled in for this shit i'm sure deflate your shoes yeah you never heard that expression
well yeah pumped up kicks you deflate your shoes and you you know oh jay's uncultured it's okay
all right let's do it you when gone am i the last jedi will you be said luke
just like he said last jedi he did what you have there spoiler alert for those of you who have
seen the last jedi although it's been almost why is it so green why does he why does he own a kylo
ren mask mug because he loves kylo ren is the best character he's such a compelling character
yeah i mean he yes to be fair kylo is the best character for for like none of the reasons they
want him to be which you mean because he's like the only one that has something going on
well he beat a barrel i don't know he's better written than kylo i i i liked kylo at first as
being a ridiculous horrible fan boy which is exactly what quinton is which is why this is
funny to me that he's drinking out of a kylo mask so you know kylo's worshiping vader's mask
and here we have you know quinton already drinking his i think it used to be milk green
is it is it oh is it ectoplasm oh that's what it's supposed to be isn't it it's supposed to be the
alien titty milk that's green no no the alien titty milk was what color was it yeah it was like a blue
it was blue i think it's green it's blue in the originals it's green in uh for luke in st
this different milk that's the point there's a lot of people like it's not the same color
is bad then they were like it's not the same cow that he's milked so it's fine it's it's blue-ish
it's it's like a it's like a very pale light blue i i wouldn't be people's problem with tlj
the titty milk is the wrong color it's just the titty milk is the wrong color it's either that
or it's ecto cooler because i know he was also apparently a fan of the um ghostbusters really
really what i say that i've not seen it but i'm still surprised it's really why would you be
surprised i mean i'm just saying like his his opinions are pretty consistent if other people
know like must be good like it's pretty much that he does like to stand against the could we know if
you like dr who season 11 he's liked all of them he stood up for all the new recent seasons of who
that i've seen him do like on twitter he made videos when did you when did you turn off it
when when did it like get bad for you when did i stop watching actively um what was her name
billy oh bill bill yeah i didn't i liked a couple episodes with her but i just i the
writing got so bad around then and i felt i could feel peter capaldi i could feel peter capaldi
being angry at the lack of material he was being given because he's a fantastic actor so it felt
frustrating to me to watch an actor try to do um back flips over garbage material and i just
kind of got bored with it so it's not really i watched a little bit in in but that was last
month i really could tolerate anything about i do really like that season but i totally understand
why people don't like yeah it has its it has its things there's some episodes that are good and
some that are so bad it's it's very mixed season and i just kind of it's right at the end like the
the ending is great but i have to have the mental capacity to get through it and i don't know if i
do i'd rather just really watch the first nine ten seasons yeah that's fair watch david tinns again
oh no no no it's all about chris reckelson well i mean he's only the one season i like him too
but i know if it is one series is my favorite do you think that at one time quinton's like
nightstand his bedside table was just four thing four star wars related things arranged and
they'll awkwardly replace that little vader doll is
he's like the sister no it's an action figure it's too big to fit in this tie fighter
oh kylo is so there's a lot of thematic elements here kylo being so much more important than vader
you see and vader's sad he's like a little boy like oh yeah that's supposed to be vader
well i think so what else would it be no wait is it supposed to be kylo i don't know i was just i
just assumed it was like one of those like dark it's a little blurry guessing it's yeah it's got
it's supposed to be vader it's not the camera it's because it's a really low quality action figure
so it's just he did this also in in the video that i in the video that i was uh criticizing him over
um his weird love poem to conjure points that he is deleted no no he deleted or unlisted well he
made it he unlisted it yeah but he put it back up it's back up public again he put it back up
oh shit okay very interesting he uh in his own words he thought it was a bad video and he put
it down and then he heard that people were canceling her and so he was like nope i'm putting
it back up i don't want people to oh wait no he thought it was bad you got the timeline wrong
in that my dude it is uh-huh you sure because i was watching it i know because he blocked me
on twitter as it was happening um oh okay unless i'm completely wrong on this and it's possible i
am but i remember i would just happen to see him posting it on twitter because i did i did follow
him i guess uh i don't anymore because he blocked me but uh it it's he was like uh i need i'm looking
for opinions uh to respond to the contrapoints this stuff this was after she got um canceled
or whatever he didn't delete the video until after that until after he blocked me on twitter
and all this other stuff because he was like asking people for their opinions of how he should
respond to the controversy by the way he deleted all of those tweets he deleted all of those tweets
he says i always do this i always ask for help and then delete all of my tweets about it
okay i don't know i don't follow you that closely my dude so i don't know okay person uh
basically yeah i just said wow that was fast that all of a sudden right after she got
canceled was when he was asking for help to help him write a new video about it and it wasn't until
like the next day that he even or maybe a couple hours later that he deleted or that he privated
that video so i thought she was your new god what happened oh yes but but the queen she slayed his
heart i'm just saying you know seriously i could have sworn i read one of his tweets saying that
what i said was how it happened that's why i said that's what i read but um that makes a lot more
sense what you just said like to me i'm sure if it's if it's how he's portraying it and i again i
could be wrong are you saying that he may not be trustworthy rags can you believe this i can i can't
believe that anyone would even imply that he is a dishonest piece of shit all right yeah we're
watching one of his videos yeah yeah it's been a funny it's been a funny epic with uh with
counterpoints on him he just wants to be noticed that's that's all it was did you just say epic
it was yeah it was epic that was pretty epic
two months at this point it seems like people really didn't care about spoilers this time
around incidentally i had this idea for an opening skit where a prominent person in my
life could tell me that novelty coffee mugs are stupid and then i would get mad and smash this
into the side of an elevator somewhere but uh i kind of like it now elevators believe it or not
i saw you really don't know any put in the town look i live next to i live in north little rock
not a very big town i'm next to little rock which is sort of bigger but man what's your
excuse for not knowing a place that doesn't have an elevator in it quinton reviews he doesn't know
what an elevator is he probably uses the elevator a lot he doesn't say he doesn't seem like a take
the stairs kind of guy i just want to question the mentality of um oh he smashed the mug into
the wall if only this was happening in an elevator i'd understand this reference yeah like
we wouldn't need an elevator yeah he just smashed into a wall surely he knows places that have walls
right he could smash it into the wall now maybe not i'm not i'm not really confused he might not
he might yeah he probably fucking hates walls dude and here we are we're back to walls
definitely actually you know what he definitely hates walls so um yeah i guess that's why he
chooses to live outside of the wall why do we keep going back to walls every time because he hates
trump we're talking about the wall the nostalgia critics the wall there's a common theme here
it's trump i knew it trump's ruining everything it's oh you know what trump colluded with nostalgia
trump colluded with nostalgia criticism to create the parody video i knew it
it will tear our country in two don't do it please it's too late he was corrupted
star wars episode eight the last jedi opening night and i've waited this long to talk about
it because i could immediately tell that it was going to be a contentious topic
star wars yeah does that explain why you would take long to talk about it
yeah it's gotta be contentious so i'd better wait do you want to see all the takes first and i guess
i could understand waiting on that proved list of people i mean that's what he means
well okay that's what he means yeah but i do understand the point because sometimes you want
to see i think it's important to like after you go see a movie or something like that to write
down your initial impressions and then yeah like wait a week if you want to be more objective about
it see what other people are saying hear different opinions try to see every perspective and then
rethink about it watch it again maybe and then you can probably have a better opinion on it
it does take a while because i think that's fair i just got the impression immediately that he was
like i don't want to speak until i know it's safe to oh that's definitely definitely yeah
with his obsession about being in certain groups he's like if i put out my take on this and it's
the wrong take according to the group i want to be with then oh they might ostracize me
it can often be exciting in the moment but they also quickly build up a sort of
cultivation of hatred so when you walk out of that theater there's this
cultivation of hate almost star wars movies in general
well i mean yeah because the last three were bad well uh even in force awakens i guess he's right
to a degree um a lot of criticism that is levied against the prequels and force awakens more so
than the last three were bad that's the last four well the last four if he's if he because
he referring to movies some periods he was thinking about i'm sure i think he was maybe referring to
the prequels oh yeah wait right so you're referring to well i i don't know that's what i'm saying i
don't know if he's referring to the prequels what are you referring because they're kind of
universally considered not good but because this was released in what 2016 this video no no last
jedi was 2017 and i think that he's a fan of the prequels too of course he is i mean he's he's in
conflicted company at that point so a lot of people who like the prequels hate the uh sequels
at least that seems to be what i've got a lot of people just hate the sequels that is true that
is true um but yeah this is i love i hate the sequels and i love the prequels but for not
great reasons um i was gonna say this probably came out in 2018 i could check the date but i'm
just saying that it's because he said it was after the release and the release was late december 2017
so well it says that this video came out in february 3rd 2018 go just topic star wars films
can often be exciting in the moment but they also quickly build up a sort of cultivation of hatred
so when you walk out of that when people think about him yeah pressure to choose a side and the
choose a side choose a side well i i can see why he views it as choosing sides
oh come on that's not how the rest of us think but no that isn't such a big thing of choosing
sides whatever i tried to release a video talking about like things that were tangentially related
to the film itself so i i like just remain neutral on the film for the purposes of that
um there were people and that side figure out like it's like you know when um you're talking
about something unpolitical and people trying to figure out your politics so they can like discredit
you yes um it was like that but with how i felt about the movie like i've never seen
more of like a oh if you just if you don't like the movie that just means that i don't
have to listen to you or if you like the movie that doesn't mean that means i don't have to
listen to you yeah it's like desperate to label so they can dismiss it's it's a single self
categorization and it's a function of social identity theory which is pretty much that as
i've said before people are cognitive managers they don't have a lot of time to spend thinking
about things it's just easier to put you into a group and say yes or no rather than understand
that there's a spectrum or that ideas can be complicated or middle of the road because for
example when we conduct research right um and i'm asking you a like and you're taking those
little tests where it's like answer this question between strongly agree and strongly disagree
yeah um now the problem is that when you put five um when you have any kind of odd number of
questions whenever there's an odd number it means that people will try to choose the number towards
the center because they just don't want to be confrontational so there's also a perception
that when you take a middle ground or a more nuanced approach that you're just being a pussy
there's just a public perception of that and interestingly it's way to lower intelligence
so people don't like taking the middle ground committing no well you can commit to the middle
ground to like it can and i my point is that there's these are perceptions these aren't realities
this is just how the human mind perceives this stuff and it's why people will uh tend to have
an adverse response when you you give the more complicated answer that requires more intellectual
thoughts some rather than a quick and dirty one and it's not because people are stupid it's because
they have a limited amount of resources to spend on this stuff
cognitive and and energy-wise resources go like like they want to be like do you love it i hate it
okay good moving on no you don't have the time or the mental energy to find a nuanced view on
everything like you know you you don't have time to become an expert in like every field but you
want to have opinions on most of the things that you encounter so yes precisely well you know when
you hear something like oh you just hear like the most reasonable sounding take without really
thinking about it and latch onto that one or the most common one people i suppose yeah well we
well you know if you hear something frequently enough it can come to be perceived as you know
more um normative and that's something like the sound critic thing not to go back to it too much
because obviously people don't want to hear anywhere about it but it's the same thing where
if everybody's saying it's terrible it's awful it's the worst video on youtube then that or a
look at pro jared how about that pro jared um you know did these bad things and they just say it
over and over and over again and then whatever the truth is and we still don't know about that kind
of stuff and and about how cringy how bad is this elder critics video is is somewhat subjective
but that's none of the nuance there matters it's just what got repeated the most
and first something called the primacy effect does that make sense the sorry i don't mean
no it's it's interesting because we we may say similar or different things to you but with much
more layman tips it'll be like when the person says stuff a lot some people think it true
there you go nailed it um but yeah because like with with tlj most people just agree now that it's
uh rather than saying it's a good film or bad film if you want to be quick you'll be like it's a
divisive film divisive no one really disagrees with that it's divisive film that's the truth well
yeah that's that is a fact well that's what i mean though um for all we know you could take a
sampling of like 10 000 viewers randomly from the earth and they all found it good you should be
like okay but it is still divisive from the reference of critical assessment i think we
could probably say i know you guys you have to have seen it the quote unquote study that came
out like maybe five months ago four months quote unquote study about studying uh basically found
that people who were progressive and nice and wonderful and lovely feminists who who are good
to everybody loved the last jebi and only nasty racists didn't like it now did you happen to read
that we're nasty racists and we didn't like it so that's happened with um it's coded it wasn't a
real study like the last gen is coded in a certain direction so i can see that there would be a
correlation there but like no you know it i i have to find the study man if you didn't see it it
i thought it was the funniest thing i'd ever seen as soon as i read the the research i immediately
emailed the the quote unquote researcher and asked him for his raw data guess who not only
never got back to me but immediately shut that shit down i wasn't the only one who called him
out i'm not saying i'm i'm responsible but he certainly never sent me his raw data so there
wasn't proof that you're racist if you don't like tlj damn really really blew my mind well there
might have been but i never got access to it you know so unfortunately i can't just uh yeah it's
it's not the only preconceived notions without any evidence are correct you got the whole
ghostbusters one where they were like sexists hate it it's like um i don't know it just seems like
well yeah no that's true actually rapists hate it too because it's just a shitty movie
like just you know like anything where it's like
well that kind of that's the kind of um oh you know who else drank water
Hitler Hitler didn't Hitler have a dog he did and he was a vegetarian and so he didn't eat his toe
see that's that's why Quinton recommends dehumanizing these people because then they
can stop being associated like yeah he wasn't human so the comparisons oh did you literally
see that he said that about Ben Shapiro Ben Shapiro yeah Ben Shapiro isn't human
it's bad to humanize Ben Shapiro basically yes he said that by PewDiePie having Ben Shapiro
on meme review it humanized him which was a bad thing was Ben Shapiro on meme review he was yes
he hosted meme review oh my god that's hilarious this is the thing we would you didn't see it we
would have Ben Shapiro on here for the memes it would be hilarious Ben Shapiro is like the most
he's just a he's just a conservative so it's not like he's crazy or anything he's not human
right of his takes but i think he's like he's i fucking love that man i he's hilarious i love
him like i will watch so much stuff but again we would ironically one of our most wanted guests would
be uh alex jones and people would be like wow you're humanizing us it would be like i don't
he's a human that's part of why it's so funny so yeah it's it's a weird humanizing like you
know humanizing isn't that great like lots of there are lots of bad humans absolutely that's
the i think that's part of the point that we're missing is like no no no don't dehumanize it's
important to recognize that humanity can reach this point humanity can get these places we need
to figure out how to prevent it it's like when someone's a bad human we need to figure out
is there a bad human don't become alex jones i don't know i want alex jones to make a movie
i would love alex jones to make a movie give him the writing and directing credits for uh
for the new star wars film let him go let him do it if you guys haven't seen the count dankula um
the the count dankula alex jones chat oh my god it is insane anyway
the last jedi has certain moments that i think are bad and there is this certain
temptation to be seduced and consumed by the dark side of the commentary about the film
but here's what's really important to me when you take away nitpicks about the story
thoughts about the characters and if it fits into canon which is oh we lost aid in fans
yeah i was going to say we're dealing with one of the greatest quotes from quidded reviews
so unfortunately she fell out will rewind for when she gets back um
uh i guess in the meantime this is actually something that we've referenced on efap this
one quote has never been played on efap so i guess i'll just play it in full while we're waiting for
to come back so that everyone can can hear it first let's just make sure last jedi has certain
moments that i think are bad and there is this certain temptation to be seduced hello hello
hello hey sorry about that uh my internet cut out for no reason oh no fun do you want to
jump back in we're about to reach yeah it's best moment let me get through you're right so that
was cut off because youtube heard that you would not witness ddos you venture for wanting to know
my location and adjust overload of the internet yeah i'm just like there are hot benchaperos in
your area i mean have you i want to win a free ipad with benchapiro can someone pay to run that
ad please there are hot benchaperos in your area i want like someone paid to run that like that
ad on like pawnhub just i want people to be on pawnhub and just see that and be like what the
fuck i will be a very quick aside but it's somewhat related in that one time in my neighborhood where
i'm staying right now i was walking around it and i found that people had stapled onto like
telephone poles just dozens of flyers and all they said it was just a picture of bob saggett and all
it said was bob saggett that's the kind of personal that i'm looking for okay that kind of shit all
right that was um you yeah you're back in all right i'll yeah it should be back in just
shuffle it around we're at the right place then we're excited the commentary about the film
but here's what's really important to me when you take away nitpicks about the story
thoughts about the characters and if it fits into canon which is all basically just fan stuff
there is very fan stuff that is what even else is there like what's left after you take all that
i mean and real story characters a plot consistency logical consistency that's just fan
shit oh it's like if he means like by fan he means people who care about it then i guess
you know people who don't care about it aren't going to care about that stuff
why why would you make a film for people who don't care about it
it's just a baffling comment
um that is wild that is out there i can't remember it's just saying all the things that
matter and just consume product and get excited about next product everything else is just fan
stuff why would you even be watching if you weren't a fan does he not consider himself a fan i'm
pretty sure he does that's the prime thing he made a tweet saying that he's the only person
who thinks it's a bad idea to resurrect palpatine because it'll kind of undo all of what they
achieved in episode six and i was just looking at that like that's just fan stuff why do you care
and that hang on that's the point where he's like hang on
so we found out that's the point that is the point that like work a load of people up to it
and you're like yeah that's what i've been saying for quite a long time
i wonder what he's gonna move on to say then because obviously if that's fan stuff then what
should we be addressing which is all basically just fan stuff there is very little that i have
to say about how this movie was actually bad visually the visuals in the score well he said
if you remove all that stuff there's very little for him to say about what's actually bad and it's
like removed all of it all of it he took away okay said nitpicks about the story so if we assume
that he doesn't think there are any significant problems with the story which isn't true but let's
just assume that then i guess he's saying the story holds up i think that he's saying that any
criticism of the story is a nitpick pretty much probably yeah it's just fans i think he probably
thinks that any any criticism that he's seen which he fucking knows what that is he considers
a nitpick even if it's not yeah this is early 2018 maybe he hadn't heard much but i still don't
believe that he thinks tlj is that bad at all he did i think he'd probably say they're nitpicks
if you remember um me and rags have had this several times the one that comes to mind the
most is like i think we're talking to billy the fridge on drunken peasants and we were talking
about the um the fuel fiasco creating the entire plot how much it doesn't make any sense at all and
there's so many different things they have to forget about in order for it to run and he was
like okay but that's like really nitpicky well we what we asked him was the why didn't they just
hyper drive a ship in front of the raddest and he and you know there's there's more than just that
though there's like the the fact the small ships are faster than big ships it's like so just send
out an army of tai fighters then is um because we know that tai fighters can catch up to them because
they did there's the whole thing they have like thousands of tai fighters they can have the
millennium falcon and the transport ship hyperspace in and out of the whole thing so it's like so when
you ferry your 400 remaining people out you could probably like a fair guess you could probably fit
i want to say a hundred people in the millennium falcon what do you guys reckon but why is it like
movie about space wizards yeah it doesn't have to be good it makes sense why do you care about this
nerd stuff well there's something you explain all that and they're like that's just nitpicks i'm like
so what's the serious stuff then what's what's the the this plot breaking stuff to you and it's just
like the themes nothing in which i think is serious except the underlying meta narrative
i think the fucking themes of broken two though are the good parts i mean i i will say this i
will say this you know george lucas to some degree knew and worked with joseph campbell
the man who wrote the hero with a thousand oh the soup guy
kill me but um he was the right of the hair of a thousand faces the hero's journey kind of stuff
he's the one who basically popularized that concept and lucas knew him so when people um
tried to truncate star wars down into it just being a sci-fi version of the hero's journey
they're not completely wrong in that it is where that comes out of in that lucas i don't know
exactly how much it was his role and his understanding of campbell and how much other
people saved the original films obviously nobody really does but it was based on a very simple
hero's journey cycle it doesn't mean that's all that was there that was i mean it's bad
because well no it no it's not bad it's core yeah that's what i'm saying it's simple it can be
totally good in fact i i think all the time mauler and i are like yeah maybe it's maybe
just have a simple story that makes sense instead of a complicated one that's just shit yeah well
that's what joseph campbell's talking about is he saying that that humans basically he was a
comparative mythologist he said that humans only have so many numbers of stories that we can tell
and simple is better for that reason and ultimately no matter how original destiny you
tried to be your story is going to be copying someone else's to some degree we know this happens
all the time um my my point through all of this is though is that i i just it's it was not every
young adult story children's book that doesn't sell more than a couple thousand copies tells
the hero's journey what made star wars interesting is not the most basic themes it's the universe
that was built around it and the intrigue and the characters and all that stuff if it was just the
most basic theme the hero myth then it would be no more powerful than any other hero myth story
it's like the paint yeah but you know they say the devil's and the details and all those details
add up yeah well as we talked about this before but like what creates stakes it's our understanding
of the rules and if you break those rules the stakes obliterate like they're just gone
how am i supposed to care about a space chase when you guys don't even care about the fact that
you've already highlighted several ways to destroy them and you don't seem to notice i'm just saying
you're like okay so they're in danger right now they should be dead but why should i care whatever
yeah and so you have to often discuss with people to try and break down what exactly is the
significant and the insignificant and you do find a lot of people say plot characters small little
inconsistencies are irrelevant compared to the overall message that failure can be the greatest
very emotionally appealing um they can still be broken down mechanically especially if you're a
failure i mean a lot of people reference the movie is like look how much it failed and yet
what can we can learn from it wow that's like what level of meta are you on my dude i thought riot
to reveal that that's why he said there's nothing wrong with this film because he's like yeah that
was all the point of it i was i designed trying to take myself a lesson about filmmaking that
failure is the greatest teacher gorgeous and wonderful really um
just fan stuff there is very little that i have to say about how this movie was actually bad
visually the film is stunning the score leaves you breathless and the actors consistently give
the performances of a lifetime yeah so the actors the music i mean
oh those things are good in tl2 oh well well some of the actors i i'm not a fan of uh
daisies acting for the most part i agree with that i find it uh i feel like she's competent like
she's confident but i you know what you know what i don't actually think it's her problem i think
it's the writing i think she's only given like two of she only has like two emotions to express
um like being upset kind of or being mild concern with mouth open yeah how do you bring that
character like hasn't got a character mild excitement with mouth a jar or mild concern
with mouth the jar there's really nothing else it's just jars just jars uh mark hamill was great
i liked him through played the depressing wanting to kill himself luke skywalker brilliantly
which is the one we all know and love reanne really wanted him to be yep let me go um kylo or um
i've forgotten his real name ham brain's melting this is what is kylo's real name Adam driver that's
uh benjapira yeah benjapira uh he he's very emotive um yes he's thought i don't think he's
a bad actor as far as i've seen and then um yes he's great and so and a lot of stuff
say a lot of stuff i've only seen him in black class but he's good man those are i
i don't know yeah it's almost like i think we're always gonna try and come back to like it's the
material though it's like the actors can only right yeah tlj is like man is it the actor or
is it just a shitty script and ryan junts and telling him you have to do it like this
and then as for like the music i mean oh go ahead you can't you know if you if you give actors
nothing to work with it doesn't matter which actor you give it to if there's nothing there
it's like the dr huda thing if you don't give them anything to work with it doesn't matter how
good of an actor they are yeah they're supposed to do with the director sees in his head basically
if the director is just terrible then he's gonna say that oh that take that you did that was
excellent that's the part that we're keeping even if it was poo poo a lot of what people say is the
problem with the prequels is that a lot of the the acting is wooden um hello there like the
i don't think that's wooden the level of acting talent that you've got in that in those films
shows the importance of a good director because what were they like this fucking ewan begregor
natalie portman uh who else is in that uh samuel jackson all playing blocks of wood ryan mason as
well um i think it suits lee mason more than it did samuel jackson we wanted a lee mason does well
um but yeah uh then as for the music i've said this before but um some of the best tracks are
all just from the older movies i don't know how much it counts yeah it does the same leitmotifs
you can't count it as new scores leitmotif and then visuals you're like oh well i mean
prometheus is pretty awesome looking too oh yeah prometheus looks great i really hate the way tlg
looks i i even like when i first saw it and didn't think it was that bad i still like the fit i just
didn't like how it looked like it was technically competent but i was like yeah it's ugly i don't know
why it's hollywood d how dare you explain your position and i promise hollywoody isn't uh like
a trans slayer or anything it feels like it's just trying so hard to be like whoa look how
good this looks it's got like the red being kicked up from under the salt and i'm like
wow they really they're really trying to make an iconic shot here aren't they
um i guess i could agree ryan filmed is going oh people are going to remember this for years
yes they will do you know my saint said they'll remember it for years they'll never be able to
the ground is bleeding as the battle breaks out war hurts the world that's what it means
this is sort of a battle right so fucking interesting about that is that why do people
remember the scenes that are iconic that um the force awakens completely stole
why do they remember all those scenes you know the the two songs why was it was it because why
would they remember that would it be because they were special effects that really blew people's
minds or was it because there was an emotional attachment to the story and the characters
i don't know jeez it really makes me think
oh i mean you know it worked for a lot of people it clearly worked for quinton he's referencing
it literally as why the film is wrong at the expense of all of the writing except probably
the theme i'm pretty sure he's gonna say the theme was great i'm sure why is it commonly considered
to be a terrible movie well for some odd reason it's become a meme that the movie is bad
what an odd reason a meme odd reason what are these mayonnaise that you speak of does he think
that people hate it because to hate it is a fun meme because we would rather hate star wars than
love it because we're on the dark side very confused we're on the dark side of internet
commentary so i just did some oh sorry really quickly i just did a bunch of research on this
specifically why consumer love becomes consumer hate and it turns out every single time based on
like decades of research people who will come to hate the thing the most are the people who previously
loved it the most because you give your time your money and your emotional support towards a brand
whatever it be and as a result when you feel betrayed you're way more betrayed than someone
who didn't really give a shit now we've we've highlighted yeah i mean who if you're yeah
absolutely you had an investment yeah so i don't know when i hated memes something if you had
invested in it exactly i was so i was gonna move on to say like the um the thing people say in
videos usually when defending the newer movies they'll be like nobody hates star wars like star
wars fans and then the chat or the well the comment section like oh that's actually really
clever yeah it seems like fans hate it the most which is so ironic and it's like no no that makes
complete sense it's the opposite of irony exactly and so like just his whole thing of this is oh
just for the meme it's just for they don't it's all just a joke no no it's it's an actual emotional
response to the shit that make you all mad about it that's just i mean i could tell you the reason
it pissed me off rather than i could just ignore it was the luke portion of it i was actually like
it's like i like this guy i'm very invested in this guy what did you do to this guy like that
it feels like a direct hit to the heart sort of thing and it's the same with um
you know a lot of content and then there's a lot of content that you might like j showing
me that doctor who episode i'm just sitting there like hurt like i don't care yeah i see and i had
to show you that because i i couldn't watch it on my own because it was genuinely making me so unhappy
yeah i'm like i fucking need help to see this like i need to see it through but that's how i feel
mauler was with game of thrones like rags i need you to understand my hatred i need you to understand
this with me no you okay this will be my last note on this i loved the last season of game of thrones
and it's only because i love the books and i've loved the books for a very long time
and i have been suffering for years through this tv show that was not going in the way that i knew
it should have been going and then everyone else got to feel sad like me so that was a cool thing
that's kind of fucked up but all right i uh people notice in my video like i don't think
he's been this angry before episode three i was so pissed nobody hates game of thrones the game
of thrones fans can you believe people who don't even know it exists don't give a shit
yeah i just i like this i was like i fucking hate just going straight to hate it yeah so i was like
i hate that new season of game of thrones it's like oh yeah why it's like well i've never seen
tv before even but that oh that got to me that season um well it's like did you ever hear about
this uh this hitler fellow he's like no he killed a six million jews like holy shit i i kind of hate
this guy so you're a fan of hitler the only reason to hate something that you're not previously
invested in is if it encroaches on something you are invested in yeah like like jews so you could
really hate them yeah sure well that makes sense so like say that movie has a message that you
fundamentally disagree with and find repugnant like even if you weren't invested in that series
before you would hate that film absolutely um it would yeah it depends yeah depends on how it's
bad well yeah like i hate it i hate it just being low quality isn't enough and instel is its own
thing like i got pissed off separately to some kind of franchise or anything ftlj was just its
own standalone movie uh without a series backing it up i reckon i don't think many people would
really care about it but i don't think uh you'd get that i don't think people would think it was
good but you wouldn't get that same emotional response negatively to it yeah it would just be
some it would be like a woman done a summer sci-fi movie that everyone forgets about yeah it's like
mortal engines was bad but no one gives a shit about mortal engines so they're mortal engines
you should give a shit about only because i think it it's the biggest financial failure of any film
ever at this point oh dude i it was it lost an insane amount of money that's it's just a good
like you know if you were trying to write a book on how not to make a movie it should just be
though that's why i any film that's marketed people will go see i find will it work free
fat movies ranks it might uh that's the thing it's not all terrible like there's a really good movie
buried deep in there somewhere yearning to break free but man that movie is a mess and it is the
thing is it looks expensive like you see that movie you know like this ain't no cost a good
you billion dollars i want to highlight by the way uh somebody said this in chat a little bit
further back but um cost a hundred million dollars hundred million no way it's not as
much as i thought it would be no way like it's still a decent amount of money you don't know
of course but like i don't know i expected more anyway uh but quinton says he's like
people hate this for some reason while also highlighting seconds ago there are several
problems with uh even if he says it's just fan stuff it's like so you've highlighted why
the fans would be angry okay so why fans would hate it okay gotcha okay kind of weird but you
know whatever quinton keep going okay movie well for some odd reason it's become a meme
that the movie is bad in the same way that it's a meme he doesn't like me but like you can
probably find a lot of things on no you mean i feel like you can find a lot of movies on there
like that wouldn't make it a meme to hate it it's very strange he's i really hate to use this
because i've even made a video like debunking it as a concept but he is the npc meme you know what
i mean like he really just is this is a thing that it's it's you're supposed to like now because
you're a contrarian and this is the orange man who is bad it's a very scripted style shit so
that's why i like he's like memes because memes are bad and that's just it's it's following a
script a weird psychological script but i believe it i'd love to see a video from him explaining
why memes are bad i'm kidding i would never like to see that this tastes good and the internet
making fun of the movie has led to people looking for reasons to hate it in the same way that people
joking that tide pods taste really are bad for you honestly believe that people would just like
i don't like this thing i need to go find reasons to hate it or worse there's memes about disliking
it i need to go dislike it before i can join in on the memes or people are like why are people
saying that and then they see why and they're like oh what does correlation causation quinton
that's the big question right yes oh so they're correlated so so i know the direction in which
things happen wouldn't it make more sense as you guys said wouldn't it make more sense that the
movie shit so people went online to make fun of it rather than people thought the movie was great
and then went online and saw memes and changed their fucking opinion which one is more logical
i'll tell you this well i can tell you about human psyche one of them doesn't make a lot of sense
it rained the day that this movie came out so as long as ryan johnson releases a film we can cause
rain that's um that looks pretty scientific wouldn't you agree that's true yeah that's yeah
i mean it makes sense he depresses the universe when he releases he presses the universe the
he is the black hole of critics you made the sky cry why would you do this the gods shed their
tears of displeasure let the people poisoning themselves out of irony once again i think that
the last time i had potential yeah they poisoned themselves out of irony as in i'm trying to does
that make sense i don't think about wait hang on we ought to think where are you guys we're talking
about irony let's listen to his sentence again i'm in north litera has led to people looking for
reasons to hate it in the same way that people joking that tide pods taste good has led to people
poisoning themselves out of irony are you the point he's making of irony so like they said i'm
gonna eat this even though it's supposed to kill me and then it didn't know that it was i mean
the people who actually ate the tide pods were troglodytes okay i mean i'm just saying like
maybe they deserve the win the darwin award i'm not going to say that i'm just saying you know
throwing it out there as an option but the people who actually ate tide pods didn't do it ironically
quinton they did it because they were so stupid but they didn't know was no stupidity is irony
oh i think i don't think he would disagree with that i don't think he'd disagree that it's not
stupid to eat the tide pods i think they were just like doing it as a joke do we have an issue with
what the word irony means and how people constantly miss it no because irony means that you would have
to be aware it would not be like really you have to be aware that it's not a smart thing to do you
have to be aware the like you know you can do it ironically on the level of oh this isn't a food
but i'm gonna read it anyway yeah what if it's just curiosity where like you know it's bad but
you're curious about what you know is it actually to ironically eat it like rule 34 to ironically
eat it would not be the kind of stuff that resulted in people going oh god i'm dying to ironically eat
it would be like haha gonna eat some tide pods fam and then eat it and record yourself dying
on stream uh well like fucking throwing up okay signs and t posing i mean that would be ironic
hey i t-pose i t-pose there's no wrong t-pose
but i i think that the most people who actually did it were just i was gonna say i thought
to realize people who did it were just unaware of what tide pods really did they were just like
yeah well uh yeah i'll eat one because everyone's talking about you remember all the people who
microphoned their iphones thinking you would charge it up exactly people are stupid it it
always comes back to this it always comes back to this cognitive miser thing like people aren't
actually stupid but we only have so again always comes back to the cognitive miser shit
our our brain's sake of a whole lot of energy we want to try to reduce that energy so our
bodies can do all the other stuff they're supposed to do this means that sometimes we won't think
and we'll put our iphones in the microwave okay that's just the outcome yeah uh just to clarify
then the person who does not know it will kill you uh is eating it because they find it a part
of a funny meme and then they go oh god it's killing me i don't think that would be irony
well they wouldn't be they wouldn't have taken it ironically there that's not irony because
to be ironic the person doing it has to be aware that it's ironic um aware of why it's funny
other i think that if you killed yourself by eating a tide pod at a stupidity that's not
ironic that's just sad you're just a dumbass i just we have this meme going where like you say
something happened and then you just say it's ironic at the end because just right did it with
loads of things we're just like someone fucking shoots themselves the head ironic success rate
on identifying irony so it's not very good and i think a lot of people and i'm not saying that
i haven't done this but you might point out something that seems funny and then you just go
ironic that you'd be like wait that's not ironic at all it's just funny like no that's the opposite
of irony like that makes sense once again i think that the last jedi has potential flaws
and i'm going to discuss them potential flaws is tangential and while i find it amazingly easy
to script out numerous pages of constructive criticism about the i'm sure you had numerous
pages i'm sure his criticism is constructive he's just implying everyone else's is being
bead or something but his no here's the thing also his is so good he had to write it out because it
was the other that other part was not important enough it's like i just uh i went ahead and wrote
it all out but i'm not gonna it's not even i wouldn't even really just went ahead and wrote
out for fun say the things you think the problems i would too that'd be an important thing to include
in a review i would think yeah the flaws like don't worry about it just all the problems are
just tangential you know the plot the story the characters this makes me sad the amount of people
who are involved in making this successful oh wait it's sad that is the saddest thing about all of
this this has no bearing on my enjoyment of the product in question this is still a really good
movie and re-watching wow only made me feel more strong and to clarify because he thinks the
objective thing is bullshit what he means when he says that is i still think i really like it
but you know you can't say that in a review because it doesn't sound very good does it
like i've seen all this and i still like it it sounds like you're making concessions but if
you say it's still good people think like oh so you think it does actually reach a standard
while also failing in certain places but the thing is it's fine and i think everyone would
be okay with it if people just came out and said i like it i don't care why because there's tons of
things that most of us like that we don't we don't need to know why alien versus predator i love that
movie e-fat movies oh yeah that's a d-fat movies right there i'll make a note we should do that
suit it is not a good movie but it is so wonderfully true exactly everybody has stuff
like that just don't pretend like you're being objective if you're trying if you claim to be
objective then you're gonna be held to a different standard than if he's not going to be i like the
thing i think he he claims to be on the right side of history and he's winton ramble that should be
his okay so the name of this video right is is the jenna is the less should i that bad
quinton reviews that kind of implies it's a review well have you heard what his definition
of a review is oh no what is it oh my goodness no oh i'm oh my review is just a description
of your experience
sucks because at that point like a review could be that is broad not that review isn't broad anyway
but wow well as someone who who has done peer reviews of academic literature let's just what
did you feel about the research did you feel well you know what what did the research make you feel
i was bored because i've been reading shit all night and i felt bored honestly you know
it wasn't that interesting uh so uh no no good i i didn't have enough to drink that night
what is this what that's that's a very interesting definition of review is all i'll say
interesting definition ugly about this the movie starts out with a huge space battle between the
rebellion and the huge i'm gonna say it's one of the smaller ones isn't it absolutely huge you
know all the styles battles it's like a ship yeah it's one big ship and there's several
several smaller ships you know probably one of the smaller scale ones in all of the styles
i guess because even the one with the millennium falcon in the empire is probably bigger in terms
of those several star destroyers flying around tie fighters and the millennium i'm being a little
bit petty here but i just find it he's he's he's being flowery is my point it's like it's a huge
battle between blood i'm saying yeah all right calm down god space battles in star wars are
insanely boring to me you can obviously tell that the choreography in star wars is heavily inspired
by the battles of the first and second world wars well they are now apparently they are now i don't
know did they used to be as well i don't they were i don't know how accurate that is but i've
i certainly don't think they were always inspired it's just the degree of inspiration i suppose
because maybe maybe that's the the whole dropping bombs on a target is obviously very like oh it's
like earth battles now in world war two you're like yeah kind of while um i'd say in in the
earlier well the ot like the designs had inspiration perhaps the tactics i'd have to look into it more
deeply but i got a full sense of when the bombs were being drawn out in the the payload thing
in tlj i was like wow they've gone really far this time they even have like the gunners that look
almost like the ones from yeah i've seen ball turrets before before it would have been inspired
by it but they would have known which parts to include and which parts not to include because
you know putting something in a different context it's not always going to work as a one-to-one
translation it's just can you just imagine a floating aircraft carrier in space it's like
it's inspired by world war two yeah and that's not we don't accept that it's like just a plane
because you get a lot yes my plane it's inspired by world war one guys you can point out a problem
or whatever and they'll be like don't you get it it's based on bubble and it's like okay that
doesn't address what i said at all so that's why it should go outside of a piece of media to
understand why it's outside of like general cultural knowledge and this excludes comedy i
would say because comedy is extremely culturally linked but if a piece of media is so specific
that it can't be enjoyed then that is going to be a detriment to the enjoyment because if it
requires cultural knowledge i mean especially if it's not even to make you understand it's to make
you ignore how it doesn't function in this new format or this new environment because all this
thing is but it's from this you're like yeah but who would know that and at how many people
would actually be able to get that reference or understand it that's not going to be that
information or meaning will not be um relayed to the general public like imagine two fat guys in a
star wars universe they have a fight on like the plane of a spaceship out in space with no suits
they're just fighting and you go it's a reference to sumo rattlers you're like yeah but this is
space like i wonder like how far away from the actual from from like okay so clearly there's
like some degree of like difference between a space battle and a world war two like dog fight
i wonder to what degree you have to remove um like the thing that you're basing it on
before these people realize okay it doesn't actually work like oh no the ship has to be
like that because it depends on the guy taking a shit in the toilet uh so that's why it's like
that like an anus appears on the star destroyer and like takes a spaceship yeah like you see it's
good because it it mirrors this thing in real life you know how you this just realtor that they're
sailing through with these ships in space like why is the this big pile of water in space like it's
like the world war two but they fought in the water massive toilet not even just that not even
just that it's like the sea you know how there's a sea in real life it's like that remember the sea
are there like whales like space whales just kind of floating around in the in the in the floating
space whales in the space sea space ocean
float and the biplanes have weird wings and while this gimmick surely was well executed first i
think after the ninth star wars film we think they could be a little more creative about it
there's this scene at the start of the movie where we're introduced to the concept of spaceships
that drop bombs you know like world war two bomber planes except in space now i know that
technically the ships of the star wars universe obviously have their own artificial gravity
meaning that if you were to drop an object within the ship and then allow it to float into space
that the item would continue to plummet but my point is that there's this certain lack
of creativity that has to come from trying to think of what a battle in space would be
well hang on but also what reason are we not given to believe that as
rockets are and and bombs are in modern fighter jets that there's a propulsion system in them
i see no evidence that that's not the case in star wars that they're being dropped physically
by gravity which is seems to be what he's implying yeah which we i guess he's trying to
trying to make it work well the other sort of but the most common thing saying it doesn't work
most common defense is the whole magnets thing right that they propelled out by magnetisms
well that's from a book somewhere that says things right right um but even but even so okay so
okay um this is not okay is this nerd shit from me saying that you know fires as much as we've seen
explosions and shit in star wars like fire can actually exist in outer space if you want to see
like a fire rocket trail behind it that actually wouldn't make sense unless it's like ejecting some
kind of like leaking some kind of fuel behind it or something yeah so actually i just never had a
problem believing that that it was that because okay because it doesn't affect the plot first off
no it doesn't affect the plot and and it has no well i guess you could say in um in the first film
but it's made to be clear that that at the end of the film that luke uses the force to be able
to do this and it's this one small thing like a tiny little bit of moving the or redirecting the
rocket you know um instead of a gigantic well it's it's the trail itself that doesn't impact
anything right if it was just a little light essentially of the internals of the rocket
propelling itself then it would have done the exact same thing i just don't think that
i don't think it's the same thing i don't think there's any real indication that it's supposed to
be like dropping it via gravity if he's trying to make a logistical illogical point here about
people just confused anyway it's like why drop bombs that way when it puts you in such a vulnerable
position instead of firing them like you've always done shoot them from a distance like
like missiles that exist you might be like well they could shoot them down they could put
tie fires in the way and it's like yeah or you could just blow up with your stupid other plan
they do it's like oh imagining a world war ii movie where they have hand grenades and they've
like got a new battle tactic if they pull the pin on the grenade uh then walk up to the enemy they
want to blow up with it like tape it to them and then walk away and that's the new system of
delivering grenades it's just like the taliban i would just recommend them do what we learned at
the end of the film which is just you know have a ship that's just piled with explosives and
hyperdrive it into the into the big ship don't even need the explosives target use it use a
droid put it on autopilot if you have to whatever done done done you see through here yes you see
through he's had his time time to be a hero you're always meant to be all right and putting it in
space given the most of the battles in star wars are very much traditional in a 20th century fashion
then the invention of the death star in episode four itself is a clear allegory for the invention
of weapons of mass destruction this is the turning point in human conflict something that totally
changed the face enemy forces in an innocent uh about the last jedi also i guess he's getting
there oh you just now notice he's getting there he's getting there i'm sure of it simple 30 years
after the invention of the atomic bomb the dictionary definition of a war had been rewritten
from the ground up but 30 years later in the star wars universe it's all kind of the same
in between episode six and seven the rebellion has been in total power for three decades
but you wouldn't be able to guess that all since the original i don't disagree let's ask a question
about that slightly different shaped vents on them let's ask some questions about that it's
evolved it's gotten worse excuse me he even calls them the rebellion the rebellion has been in power
for 30 years rebellion against maybe they might be the other dogs we're still the other dogs
how are you in power you're the rebellion the fundamental force of question the eternal communist
question i guess uh trilogy you can't shake the feeling that the rebellion must have done nothing
for 30 years for them to be overtaken this easily by some rogue terrorist group the fact
that every other star wars movie seems to be about them trying to stop the bad guys from
inventing nukes easily signals that no one really seems to have a lot of big ideas about how to
be hideous war but in space and i'm bringing all of that up because despite the fact that it annoys
me it doesn't ruin the fun oh oh it's great filming that's fine for him it doesn't ruin his
fun it's bad rating it's bad rating but i had fun it doesn't make sense but all right then
all right in my last review when i said that the prequels are bad because the characters
constantly lose the respect of the audience while the universe seems to stay relatively consistent
well in the case of the sequel trilogy it's the except the characters aren't consistent either
i think he likes him no sorry he likes him it doesn't bother him it doesn't ruin the fun j
sorry he likes it like you and your thoughts do my thoughts your thoughts jay's army of thoughts
begone consistent well in the case of the sequel trilogy it's the exact opposite the universe is
now contrived without consistency scale or even the ability to not feel like a broken record but
none of this really matters when you're watching the film because what you've actually come to see
is the characters because you can turn your brain off doesn't it matter how the characters
get to places and are able to make decisions or experience events he's like it didn't matter to
me but he's like saying it as if it's my question the question to quintum would then be it's like
okay so after the scenery blows up here layer uh kylo goes into the ship and then he sees han and
han is like um how could you and they have like a whole drama about how he's he's essentially
killed his mother and what that means for the family and then if quinton was like han's dead
i'd be like dude don't understand like that's annoying it's fan stuff like this is important
drama that's happening here this stuff matters much more about the characters i'm having fun
yeah i'm having fun watching this i mean yeah okay han died but does that really matter
ask yourself there's fan stuff it's just world rules that apparently when you die you stay dead
and stuff the screen characters like ray poe and finn who managed to carry the four
seconds just by making the audience invested in their dynamic and what was going to happen
oh yeah race dynamic yeah i'm gonna have to ask for a reference to that one
you know with uh stuff um and uh remember how she fell in love with kylo after she hated him
for killing her father figure that she developed over one day that was a great arc yeah i've known
some daddies over a day that i haven't touched fingers they did touch fingers forget that
to be fair that did happen in star trek three the search for Spock they touched fingers it's
a very essential yeah it was a very sensual moment maybe they touched fingers in there
uh uh sauvik and Spock didn't uh wasn't it through a wall or was it actually did they directly touch
they think no they directly touched fingers they were gloves or was this unnatural i was
gonna say that sounds more effective than stalls because they did this through a full stream so
it doesn't really count right right right but again i'm just saying of course always ripping
off star trek as always as usual graders of episode eight had the task of not only continuing
the literal story of the battle between the rebellious story no no it didn't because that
story who ended the ripples had won yeah well it was only ongoing if you chose to make it
yeah they it's like they arbitrarily decided that nope this stories we're just gonna keep
on trucking fuck it because you may have destroyed their enormous weapon in this like but they have
a shit ton of stuff left in this universe that we've all that we've all come to know and like
we understand how this universe works i could have told any story within it uh from that starts from
the good guys being in power and they're like no no star wars can't start out with a good
guys are in power that's silly you know could you imagine if they had like a series of tense
stories about the good guys trying to keep like some villains have some like really clever plans
it wouldn't work i guess you're right do it the jj way the jj way so the creators of episode eight
had the task of not only continuing the literal story of the battle between the rebellion and
the first order but also of using all of the significant characters from episode seven in such
a way that they could find a satisfying end in episode nine most of the major plot points
and how do you know that they've done so they're resolved fins like only arc if you can call that
yeah they got rid of every question supposedly although they're going to
walk this back but ray's heritage snokes dunzo yep this is not setting up for a next movie
i'm kidding yeah i feel like ryan see how you could get that ryan wanted ryan was just like
fuck this shit i'm out ryan was like i'm telling my own story and amongst this trilogy as you call
it but i don't really care it's my one movie belongs to me i'm done and done i'm out and
it's like dude there's another movie to come and he's like oh cool at the end they were like good
job with you're a part of a trilogy ryan and he's like the trilla what like what have we got
setups like many people around the mountain falcon could go anyway they could go in yeah
big galaxy right so they go to they go to even though it makes no sense because of the the
hype space dragon but whatever it doesn't matter forget about that getting about things is a very
good strategy i hear from that's a big brain directly specifically analyze and move forward
to the leading cast that being ray fin po and kylo ren what this means is that the story often
takes more of an interest in having these characters appear and grow than it does having
all of those plot points be connected in any sort of satisfy having the plot points be connected in
any satisfying way i like that he agrees like with this this this the case that none of it
adds up none of it makes any sense it's just the name of the casino planet i always forget canto
bite so yeah okay so the fact that i can't because i can't oh bite that this is a real
entire thing has nothing to do with the plot that's okay storylines don't have to come together
we could just waste your time for fucking 35 minutes 40 minutes yeah the wall
you see if but if if what he was saying like was true that the characters are great uh in spite of
the plot not making so much sense i mean what you would have essentially have there is end game
which is great so the the characters aren't good either like no that's the thing he's missing
i mean i mean he he propels the idea that they're actually awesome and they've grown
and stuff i'm like make that video why what do you what's this illustrated well i assume he's
going to elaborate on that right we'll see so much of the secondary plot okay true we'd rather have
how and um like um the plot makes sense or the characters treated well if i could only have one
treat value be the characters characters if you have good characters that can carry a shit plot
so yeah the thing is and this isn't this is just like a sort of if your characters are perfect
let's just say that for lack of a better term right now or consistent then your plot should
typically be pretty consistent too because it's driven by these characters but no you could yeah
so that's what a plane like the world instead of like the world building or
because for example yeah like hux wasn't a character and you just didn't see that like
the first order was making loads of baffling decisions but you didn't see that happening
but there wouldn't be a character to blame for that that would just be a weird plot all right
yeah i got well it's a weird criticism when you say the first order retarded
uh you can also say hux is retarded like so it's a character problem for him but it's a
world building problem for how it's how isn't how how in the world did they come to this kind
of power when they make these kinds of decisions all the time um so like what i'm trying to get at
is characters are usually at their best when they're fully clearly motivated and so their
motivation pushes them to do x y and z and so then we're really running into if the plot is damaged
it's often in a category of a world rule being broken or a character doing something or saying
something that's not possible um hard to fully separate characters from world right i'd say from
plot pretty much i mean characters are generally products of you know the world they're in i mean
you could have great characters and a really stupid story but still like the characters in
it or you could have a really yeah you could have a really amazing story but kind of boring characters
hitchhikers guy to the galaxy in which direction actually i'd ask oh fuck it i don't know
hitchhikers has i was curious what he's gonna say in my opinion in my opinion well yeah well i
mean like in terms of like it's kind of nonsense you know but it's it's cheeky it's consistent
nonsense right right it it's consistent when it's self-consistency is what matters you can have the
craziest weirdest a disc world you know is a great example as well everything about disc world is is
absurdist on its face but because it's consistent within itself it's fine i think though that as
long as the characters you can't have characters devoid of a story and and setting and narrative
and you can't have a narrative without characters or you can but it's difficult um so they're
reliant upon one another to a degree i would say yeah and um they're all yeah it all comes under
writing right but like you can try and split them into these portions to make it easier for
almost for conversation or analysis when you like a world plot character but they all definitely
intertwine in particular moments and so the idea that you have this absolutely dreadful plot but
perfect characters i would be curious to see the works i feel like surely it's the plot could have
damaged the characters in that characters are making decisions that don't make much sense
that's that's often a criticism but it might not be i think it's theoretically possible to have a
terrible plot with characters that aren't affected badly by it at all typically you'll find that
there are some characters that don't even like they're reactive to a plot that's moving without
them um like a jack sparrow type thing where they're wandering the world and things keep happening
because of other people and so they're reacting to it so the plot can't necessarily by breaking
affect those kinds of characters um it's all very interesting but let's uh let's see where
he's going with this secondary plot featuring such characters as puzzle yeah just things
can i come up not to say that jack sparrow doesn't affect the plot at all my hands are
going up so same when he arrives in the film he's just he's just doing his thing and then he gets
captured and helps will turn it all that stuff well and fin ends up feeling disconnected from
the rest of the movie because the only purpose of that part of the film is to give them something
to do which is why it turns out that the bad guys can now track people through light speed
which is one of those sci-fi reveals that the writers think we care about but it's actually
just really kind of important kind of ruins everything that they think we care about this
is okay so this is inoculation stuff he does this all the time where he's basically reframing the
argument as like well if you care about this then you're a stupid nerd and that reframes the
argument from hey a real question that people would have about them suddenly being able to track
this stuff that's just nerd shit you know and it makes if you happen to have those feelings
his intent by framing things this way is to make you feel ashamed for having those feelings
which are reasonable concerns not nerd shit yeah and i'm also if it's never been introduced
before so when it comes down to like certain media he probably finds it a lot more bothering
and then just it's like eh but it doesn't matter when it comes to star wars oh the one
that people often give is star wars has always been nonsensical always i love that one frustrating
is one of those sci-fi reveals that the writers think we care about but it's
actually just really boring it's like when rogue one talked about the kyber crystals
or how even the intro what was wrong with that i don't remember there being a problem with them
it was boring oh okay there weren't explosions and lightsaber duels so it's boring and lame
oh no production of the metachlorians and the prequels like you think we care oh people gave
shit about that people definitely cared about that that what could he have found a worse example
maybe jar jar binks maybe the senate would have made it a good example a lot of people found it
boring that was something yes that's a perfect one everyone hated the politics so just say like
nobody cared about the senate stuff people who really cared about the metachlorian thing people
like rioted over that i say i never hit the end of the metachlorian thing does he not understand
that like the reason that you that people care about this stuff isn't because it exists because
of the impact it has on the story and the world like if there was like a just a passing line in
the movie that was irrelevant to the plot where they're like oh we can track people through
hyperspace now then yeah you wouldn't give a shit but the fact that you can track people through
hyperspace means that the enemies can actually like track the heroes and that the heroes have
no way of escaping that's the part of it you care about something which had been established
and something had been established beforehand that they couldn't do so you're
so good that's it it's just you already established that they couldn't track them through
hyperspace and now it's just stupid nerd shit if you care about why they suddenly can or it's
boring i'll tell you what terrible we can keep because you can keep doing it forever like if
i made a star wars movie and i have this moment where uh darth evil is about to kill jedi good
man and he's just about to swing and then another jedi turns off the sith lightsaber from a distance
with the force and then the sith guy's like what the fuck turns it back on and then the
that guy puts it back down on and on down it's like ha ha you can't kill them now everyone
be like you can do that that's exactly what and i'd be like well yeah it makes some sense to me
that you could just like no no stop you're ruining it stop it stop inventing these weird new things
like and then you get the argument it's like oh so styles is never allowed to grow and it's like
you can grow without contradicting that's all we need yeah we have things called growing pains
sad face nice um and besides uh yeah if you're gonna pick like the idea here like
take like an audience member like i don't know my dad he's watching this and i go so what do you
think about midichlorians you probably be like i don't know i don't get it really i don't understand
what it would like maybe he's appealing to like key demographic yeah like a larger movie audiences
the don't necessarily care about this but i feel like that's you don't have to pick and choose your
audiences for each of these arguments exactly exactly because the whales which you know that
they do call these big fans the whales will be your biggest purchasers but also your biggest
attractors so they have to figure out what they want and i don't think they know what they want
exactly i think they're trying to go for a mainstream audience well completely missing
what made the mainstream audience like star wars in the first place dev on said mola the ship with
the tracker got destroyed that's why they were able to escape at the end if you remember and
this is i haven't seen tlj now in over a year i feel like oh well maybe less than a year i can't
remember but they say that they can't just destroy the ship with the tracker because the
other ships have trackers and they just turn them on wait did that actually is that what they said
yes really bad writing because it's it's so many levels of stupid now you're fucked
the maneuver destroys all of the ships though no there's there's like one left or something
right it's not all of them is it i thought that's the they have to they have to launch
they have to launch ground troops down to crate there's still a functional there's still
functional ships yeah i'm gonna look at the supremacy isn't destroyed it's fucked up right
yeah if they had a throwaway line to say our hyperspace tracker is fucked or something like
maybe i'd give it to you it flew straight into the tracker room oh no a random piece
of space debris hit the tracker wires and it's the only one in existence i'm trying to look for
a shot of like that moment i'm gonna try and see if i can find if it shows any uh star destroyers
that made it that's give me one second the tracker has a special vulnerability to explosions
yeah uh just to remind you right it's my only weakness the um the busy posts they tell po that
the tracker is on the big ship and he goes so we destroy that and then like uh i like what you're
thinking but no that'll only delay them because they'll just use it to another one and i was like
you can just casually destroy the superstar destroyer you just okay he sees what if we just
destroy it it's like yeah what if we just did that i think that was possible you know you might
what if we just killed all the bad guys yeah in the shot jay i will send it to you
just i was i was i could remember the the certain ones that were unscathed if you look at that
um it shows like three star destroyers at least that survived i guess um oh there's a whole side
to them actually there's one two three four five i want to say six at least i like how they're all
clustered up at the part exactly where the explosion happens they're all just right there
like you're expecting to fucking also i love how like the shot suddenly becomes not well lit
after the thing hits yeah so i was just gonna say that um uh that there's more to it there's
no reason for them to be able to escape that also that people did care about midichlorians
dramatically and you know what i referenced the senate people really cared about that too
i'll be honest with you i there's a lot of people out there who love the senate scenes i'm not gonna
say that people didn't um it's just the i found this universe work oh yeah i found them being
referenced as boring by a lot of um reviewers if you will this person has a video essay called
this person has a video essay called star wars battlefront to how droidekas change the game
they kind of do they did they changed the game i admit when i'm doing galactic conquest and i
finally unlock them i'm like oh yeah here we go i fucking hate seeing footage of the star war of
the ea star wars battlefront games because i'm like oh that looks so cool and then i remember
what it is oh it's evil and i don't want to touch it were they referring to the new one in that video
the new well there is footage of the new one i'm okay i like i'm seeing a droid who can move and
i'm like holy shit it looks so awesome i just want i want those graphics on the original games
at molar and rags po is right though they could sneak onto the ship and sneak a bomb on it and
that would kill huck snowgown kylo um what bomb is large enough to destroy i'm trying to think of
like maybe if they went to like some kind of control engine thing but like the idea that's
considered so easy to me is pretty baffling like let's just do it wow before we just do that anyway
that thing is a really big ship just just go for it just get rid of it anyway then you remember
that in canon there's two and a quarter million people on board like oh god that's a lot of
stories even the introduction of the metachlorians and the prequels like you think we care but we
don't so finn alongside a new character named rose go off the reason people care about that
isn't because they exist and that's it it's because it has an impact on the story the messages
that people care dramatically that's one of the things i probably highlight in the column of what
things people cared about in the prequels i'm imagining like someone um pulls out a knife on
quinton he's like why am i supposed to care that a knife exists i'm like no important to the plot
it's important to the plot at least your plot i'm trying to find someone you can help them
temporarily disable the first order's tracking system rose is the fresh blood addition to the
cast and i honestly found her to be interesting enough but i did find her constant interesting
enough i like i found her interesting enough what else do you need rags hey guys stabbing
by faint praise well i mean do you want to play the what is it the um blanket game on how do you
describe rose tico without i got interesting or what she looks like all right well i i think i
think you can i so i'd say arrogant um selfish to a degree she's certainly naive
uh idiotic especially whether she hit hit fin with the ship that was really
naive is probably yeah naive is an idiotic or both good ones yeah i'm going to what you
would associate as positive traits she uh but actually you know what actually another thing
about it that might be better than a lot of the other characters in the sequels i mean what
describes what describes ray at least rose is a flawed character in terms of being insufferable
but like ray is one attribute altruistic we don't know why she just is but we don't know why so it
doesn't make sense um so yes i guess you know what i would say objectively rose tico is a better
character than ray i might agree with that though like because i think ray is awful ray is such a
blank slate she's like what you start with when you're making a character you're like right so
this is a person they look like a person sort of so that's a good place now let's start writing
what they are i mean what do you want to say jay what do you want me to say
she is a person that would be offensive yeah no i mean women are people am i right
somewhat grating at times people have started to call her the modern jar jar which is a little far
i think she's just a potentially fun character who doesn't have a lot of room in the movie
i would like to commend the filmmakers for casting an asian actress in the role i know
that pointing it out oh thank you oh yeah we we know the asians really need a leg up they're
doing really terrible oh thank you so much for helping out the asians do you think that do you
think that the casting director saw this video and went oh my god he noticed thank you quinton
i'm sorry if you were kelly marie tran they told you we hired you for your asianness not your acting
ability oh my god you're like you're not a good actor but but you got the right
either he thinks they only hired her because she's asian and he's casting he's uh he's
commanding them for that which like like that's not the right approach to cast people right no
i wouldn't say so he's he's commanding them for casting he's commanding them for not having a
like just for not being racist like you know he's committing them for going which of course
someone who wasn't white that means that you don't hate everyone who wasn't white which means
you're not racist good job guys because people like quinton you have to prove that you're not
racist and even then you still are just subconsciously does it prove you're not racist if you hire an
asian even though if your goal was to look like you don't hate right asians well okay they're
standard in the conundrum of all this right really quick here's the conundrum of all of this
is that if you care because they care so much about representation in race but then same time
you can't recognize race so he okay did you guys saw the the um uh posters that went up that said
islam is right about women yeah now do you understand why this made people lose their minds
it's because yeah because it's just yeah it's like it's okay to be white competing ideas so
is it good to hire asians because we need more representation of poc or is it racist to
discriminate against people and separate them via their race for one reason or another and they
can't hold the they have these two opinions at the same time but can't recognize how they are
incompatible so they just have like a bunch of cognitive dissonance and work around it
psychologically that's what this is it's a big psychological exercise as to what jay said i think
that's probably what quinton would say he's like no i'm just looking at the full cast and i'm seeing
that they're not specifically hiring only white people and that's cool you'd be like uh-huh what a
fucking damp thing to be commended for i know well done on not being a terrible person
not a room in the movie i would like to commend the filmmakers for casting an asian actress you
know what i'm pretty sure i don't have like a completely reputable source for this but i've
heard that ryan johnson has never stabbed anybody and i'd like to commend him for that you didn't
show up really thank you ryan that's probably not even a rape that is commendable even though they
believe in things i bet he's not i mean then again have you ever seen ryan johnson and a rapist
in the same room before at the same time i don't know i don't know i'm just saying
welcome to efap the role i know that pointing it out like that only makes it feel less normal
but the strange stigma that hollywood has against casting asian is there strange stigma against
hiring maybe there is is that i don't i need to see references i don't know that myself if that's
a thing then i guess it is commendable to go against the trend if that's a thing is that a
thing where asians are just not hired well again i mean statistics type cast type cast
often yeah but lucy lew uh was it was a major um hollywood leading lady for years and nobody gave
a fuck so i don't understand where that comes from like that like just coming up with one example
though doesn't demonstrate the trend but it doesn't know this you're correct statistics for this kind
of thing yeah that's my favorite thing so there's too much approval for the statistics on this
so five point the asian american population in the u.s is about five point six percent
well no that wouldn't even be a way to do it because you'd have to have
you would have to take the percentage of people who apply for roles who are asian
and see if they're representative of no but then if asian people are underrepresented like in
in acting roles then you know that there's a bias somewhere but you don't know where it is not
necessarily they might just yeah you can do all this through regression analysis what you would
really want to do there just to be able to see if there is a particular overwhelming bias is just
to look up how many um leading how many big roles you know like say within blockbuster movies
have starred um asian american or asian men and women and then you would compare that to the
u.s population which actually so it's five percent and then you could come up to see whether or not
it was representative um i would be surprised if it was not yeah but a lack of representation
doesn't mean discrimination it does not it depends it depends on where the we need very
specific information man it's like it's like saying the nba discriminates against short white
jewish people it does it does but not for like the reasons they're trying to highlight yeah so
although i would ask the opposite question i would ask the opposite question right so let's just
just to be clear let's let's place this into perspective um does anyone ask for the japanese
or hong kong or korean film market to have more white people in their movies because those is
there a white population in those countries though it's got to be yes but if there was a
population population in those countries i think that's why right sort of the applying thing as
well like how many how many people in kaina who are like white american are applying for acting
jobs there i wonder oh no and five i think that we probably have about five percent representation
i could be wrong that's just my my base guesstimate and uh but i don't think that there is like some
dearth of of asian people in television and film um or i i think most groups are are represented
and and you know the really cool thing is about that is that um there's something called the
parasocial contact hypothesis which is a chakra reagan hughs uh 1995 and what they posited is
that when people would no not 1995 excuse me 2001 wow got my numbers all wrong there what they found
though is that people watching just a few episodes of um will and grace people who had no previous
in exposure to gay people ended up becoming much more tolerant of gay people and gay marriage after
they watched a few episodes so seeing i'm just saying scene representation we've seen in research
scene representation of other groups that you don't have any personal experience with that's
positive can increase positive perceptions and so i understand the reasons why people want
representation but one to one representation is a kind of silly goal to aim for because then i would
say well there's one percent population in china that's white so i better see one which they
probably have or that's black and you don't see any of that coming out of hong kong films that's
for sure you know uh i'm just saying that uh put things in context like the problem is that you
have to do this for literally every group like every disability every skin color every race every
religion and it becomes an impossible task sexuality there's there's loads of categories
that technically become over because categories are by their very nature and it becomes and it
becomes impossible yeah i think if you're saying it for like each individual piece of media it's
ridiculous like no individual people media can accurately represent it represent like a whole
population but if if it's if you're talking about like all like you know like just an entire industry
of media then anywhere that there's like a disconnect between the population and like
the percentage of that populated like this actually that they represented is going to demonstrate
as a bias or bias of some kind yeah but not all biases are bad not all discrimination is bad no
i didn't say that but yeah i sort of also find it generally offensive for me even that he's like
i'd like to congratulate them on hiring an asian woman because to me that's what really betrays it
it's not about anything other than just representation and well you say it with the
same tone that you'd say i am so glad the football team let the retard play right it's it's it's
condescending right i'm glad he highlighted but i'm sure i like a good chink in my armor and you
know what i'm saying he um we highlighted the issue himself he said seconds later that i know
highlighting this makes it seem less normal and it's like it's a stop you need to stop i like the
idea of him saying this next to uh what's the name kellie rue tran and like looking over to her
her like did i do good and her just being like dude can you please just like shut up
yeah this is what i mean i found the stats but um oh come on the according to the usc
asian characters made up only 4.8 of speaking characters in hollywood films last year
despite being 5.7 of the earth's population okay no there was a pretty light bias but like
yeah not huge that's pretty fucking close that's pretty damn close i say i'm amazed
that it's that close considering we're talking about so many decisions made by so many people
across so many movies you know so looking pretty again is it an issue of the population or of the
people who apply we are nine percent racist all right for instance like um like 25 percent of
congress all right like politics basically is women but women generally don't apply at or
run for these offices nearly as much as men and then when you take that into consideration
voters don't care what your rate or what your gender is so yeah there's a lot more that goes
into it yeah talk to me all day about that that physics i know everything about that
a small bias somewhere but we don't know where it is it could be in as yeah the kind of uh no
no uh see that see you you've made a a um judgment before the data are clear because
i don't know the data on this either but you say a bias but that doesn't actually mean
because bias implies an intent right uh or it's not an active intent it's a subconscious intent
whereas the bias such as it is may be internal meaning that maybe asian people are less likely
to seek out um acting parts in america and would rather go and work well the fact that
matter is that there's there are a million variables and while we cannot use correlations
to make causal inferences because a causal inference requires regression analysis and
you can't do that by having just yeah and let's say um an asian woman showed us an email from
the director she contacted an indie film saying can i be in it and he said no you're asian i hate
asians we'd be like oh that's that's just straight up oh that's fucked up then dude the
whole world would go insane yeah what i'm highlighting is like that's confirmed right
there but these statistics they can go many ways until we get loads more details um we can't
it's a circle of like okay so if say uh all of the films being made in hollywood at the moment
like just the biggest most popular thing was like i don't know uh movies about fucking uh what's
a place where fucking everyone is white uh i don't know like a historical period historical
period in which like literally like it was a a very white place and for that reason for the
historical accuracy it was basically all white people sure oh there's like really popular about
loads of like iceland movies about iceland is like the biggest hollywood trend at the moment
for that reason both um there's um like essentially asian actors won't be getting
hired as much and then because of that uh fewer asian people would see themselves getting into
acting so then when the trend of like icelandic films died down you would still have fewer asian
actors represented in other movies that wouldn't necessarily have any reason for that bias
yeah i feel like this is the thing we could go on for a while i remember highlighting like what
would you guys say if a female director was making a direct a film about a sorority of women
who are locked in a house because one of those women is trying to kill the rest of them or something
and someone was like you don't have men in this film they're not being represented that's like
oh would you just be like well no you wouldn't be in this if the female sorority you know i mean
like the context of each of these and then you'll have exactly some people will be like yeah that's
fine and then you go okay so now let's expand it and you're like well what do you mean well a
historical period where there were no black people or something you're like and it's just
you wonder where the rules are clearly set because i think the world would be just fine with that
sorority film but if you know certain ones in reverse maybe also much i don't know i mean in
star wars it's a sci-fi series right so i think we can all agree that like that kind of stuff
doesn't matter in star wars with aliens and and so who cares if somebody looks more asian or more
brown or more white or whatever nobody gives a shit it's all fantasy um my only issue with that
statement is just with quinton's way of phrasing it which it makes it sound like a congratulations
on being asian which is so reductive and so racist i would say um but that's just my opinion
on it that's my only i don't think that we need to have a one-to-one completely accurate
representation of the populace in film and media to illustrate that this is somehow a that we
somehow live in a racist or um sexist or oppressive society see uh do you ever watch community
so when that episode i think it's season two but when they're trying to work out what their
mascot can be without being racist in any way um oh the human being yeah jeff concludes he's
like i see being racist is the dude not being racist like they've managed to flip it all the
way around now that desperate to be not racist is becoming racist but yeah so i love community
communities actually as much as i dislike dan harman as a person um he he had some very good
ideas i love that shit i'm kind of curious what's wrong with that now i'm in at this point hollywood
has it oh my he said some of my sweet semi-child it's more than a go look into it jay i wonder
if actually i can give you that i can give you an inside scoop on a thing that the internet has
forgotten about which is the time that he completely lost his fucking mind on like a
14 year old english as a second language speaking person on twitter who was like oh hello um dan
harman i really am liking of the rick and the morty and and harmon just flipped out and screamed
at this kid for i'm not joking like six hours on twitter why told him to kill himself just because
he was in a mood that's what he used to do he was in a mood and he he doesn't kind of shit all that i
used to listen to his podcast every week and he would just it you know also the podcast yeah where
he said that uh half the country are uh nazis and you know went into the whole orange man bad
shit that of course he does but he yeah he's a nutter and he's he's been a real jerk also he
abused his ex-wife but you can watch documentary that used to be on netflix more on that one
yeah i was gonna say i probably know that rick and morty is funny and um i think a lot of people
like to say that it's also very much due to um i've forgotten the second guy's name justin roiland
that's the one but i think don ham is capable of making some awesome shit because of community
and rick morty seems to be a bit unhinged he yeah he's unstable he needs help and
um yeah i don't know uh smart talented guy but he just needs someone to get his crap
under control he needs someone to help him filter he needs somebody to lean on
we all need someone against casting asian actors really disgusts me and the fact that there are
actually people on the internet who see an asian actress on the screen and think to themselves
uh these social justice warriors and their propaganda really disgusts me who thinks that
um who has ever seen an asian you're like oh i'm sure they're out there but jesus christ is like
yep that's that's what they're that yep that's them all them yeah all those anti-sjw people
they say highlight the fact just like thank you quinton for letting me know that people who hate
asian people are just not people you like because i wouldn't have known otherwise it's not like
hating asian people is a rational position that you disagree with i am i am signaling to you my
virtue i am i am good progressive man i'm glad i was just gonna assume that people are super
evil subconscious racists in the air okay who's seen just let you make it clear for everyone
watching i don't hate asian people i don't i don't i put my hand up i will now accept your
super chats dedicating several hundreds of pounds to me i mean i do but
this video is clearly about you tris on the screen and think to themselves
oh these social justice warriors and their propaganda really disgusts me honestly if you're
one of those people who immediately see the character on the screen that doesn't look like
you and you just think oh this character could have been white then honestly why are you giving
these people attention that is not what anyone has ever said about rose tico as a character fault
i mean maybe maybe somebody on poll unfortunately i'm sure but it has nothing to do with her being
asian it has to do with her being insufferable and pointless this character ate a white like
what the hell who said this source he found some tweet on the internet from somebody no one knows
about at least he was showing someone saying it it would help well then when he found the most
insane tweet out there yeah or a youtube comment with no up votes that's a troll it's like oh
these characters aren't white bad come on he can't even he can't even find a shitty youtube
comment or a tweet or can't even make his own bot tweet because let's be honest i wouldn't be
surprised but why didn't he pull in anita sargasian as well you're right let's think oh just just
make up your own tweet make your own private account call yourself i don't know cat wrangler
97 and just be like oh my god it's good that he disapproves of such things because if i didn't
know that i would have distrusted this review i'd have been like does he does does he approve of
asian asian's yeah that's the thing that he's implying it is he should have plenty of examples
he's also kind of making it seem like it's an exotic thing like oh you put you put one of the
one of them like oh thank you very much it's so weird and creepy
uh i i could i could imagine quinton having like one of those being one of those weird people who
fetishizes asians like maybe not so much anymore but in his early days i can see that if only
quinton uh contra points was asian perfect package but quinton yes are these social justice warriors
and their propaganda really disgusts me honestly if you're one of those people who see the character
on the screen that doesn't look like you and you just think oh this character could have been white
then honestly you can just fuck off this character could have been white i mean do you deny that the
character could have been white i mean i really like the free screen there too it's quite good
i want to say it like in reference to to rose in gedel III i would be like you know she was a
great character but she could have been white and they chose not to which is very disappointing
because that's kind of what it sounds like he's saying
like she was really good as a as an asian i mean she could have been white
but she was a pretty good actor considering she's asian oh which is waiting for these
seriously sincerely who the fuck else even thought about that this is why it frustrates
me when i'm called like a racist and stuff when i go i just don't give a shit yeah you must be the
racist i would be frustrated regardless of this but well dude i don't know sometimes i mean i
say i'm frustrated it really just makes me laugh because i'm like oh rags you know i just kind of
the same area of the internet which means i don't know how much you get this lower but uh people
will just call you a racist for no reason and they don't really have to have evidence they'll
just be like well this proves it they'll never tell you oh yeah no they'll never oh man i got
i got a whole bunch so it was i was a racist for a long time but that's the stop not liking that
for me you must like the black people don't like the black exactly and then i'm like i like blade
and then they're like well and count yeah but he's a vampire he's not really fully black and
i tell him as well i like black panther in civil war because he was awesome like yeah well he was
really awesome yeah he was he had an arc in civil war exactly black panther had an arc in civil war
right we got to we actually got to see a character i mean instead of um
uh man what was the name of the villain in in black panther is the only character kill longer yeah
i mean he was really the freaking character i would say in the whole movie but whatever that's
a totally different discussion um it's it's frustrating people are going to call you racist
no matter what you do but to me it seems weird unless you're adapting something where characters
have specific races you know in which case i would find it sounds weird when they make choices that
change it um when they seem unnecessary or when there's no good reason for it as in the actor
isn't necessarily the best choice why would anyone care in star wars it's it's a
whole universe nobody cares
i at least to me i don't know why every character in star wars was white at this point like it would
start getting kind of it would be odd yeah it'd be really weird but every character in star wars
has not always been white they've been yeah exactly so it's not a big deal it's it's but
it's like if every character was black then would you say is i wonder what quinton would say
of literally every character was asian well that's diversity yeah i mean it's diversity because
there's so many all white films is probably what he would say and he wouldn't be wrong necessarily
then watch hong kong's then watch then watch asian cinema that then go watch uh wok hollywood
i think there's no there's no problem with that just happening you know it's like oh uh i thought
all of the best candidates were these people they're all just uh they're easy yeah that's fine
okay cool right my only my only point is nobody it's it's weird to be pointing so much attention
towards it because nobody else on the planet cares outside of people who are weirdly obsessed with
maintaining representation but my point is is that if you don't like seeing what people
in movies that come from predominantly white country or white countries like the u.s and the
u.k then watch bollywood movies then watch hong kong the bollywood movies are amazing by the way
uh bollywood movies are fantastic and wonderful and there are other options i'm not saying it's
going to be on the same level necessarily but i've been to a goodwill before and picked up like
20 nigerian films for a dollar in a dvd set and i have done that and they're terribly filmed
but if you know those languages i bet it's more interesting if you if the only thing you care
about is representation do you know what i mean otherwise why bring up the race of the actors at
all just an awkward ongoing debate that's never going to die apparently about exactly what the
correct thing to do is and then it always seems like whenever a step is taken that there's going
to be like a wait a minute what you just said is backwardly racist and then they're like what
oh but it's a great i just don't see why it matters i it doesn't it doesn't matter to me
if the actor is good i think john boyega is a good actor i just don't yeah i don't care about his
character he's great to attack the block your opinion i agree with that's objective
yeah uh well in fairness all he did was let people know the race isn't bad so
on the screen but guys i'm not one of those racists you can trust my
movies then honestly you can just fuck off speaking of which one of the more jarring
characters in the movie is that i like i just like the idea of people watching that
part where he's like if you're racist you could just fuck off like oh wait i'm racist i better
stop watching this video how many racists like unironically identify as being racist rather than
being being right well i'm sure like there are racist groups there's still a there's still a
couple nazis around i'm sure they'd identify as being racist sure people would call themselves
like race realists and then well it depends on how you want to frame race realists or how you
want to define racism i was gonna what i'm trying to say is are we going to do this argument
okay iron and let me find something
this just sort of tangentially related uh you know i don't need it though i have a picture um
of uh that i took a couple of years ago of um the window across the road from me where the guy
who lived there apparently um decided that the best way to decorate his flat
was to hang up across um one of the walls a huge swastika
wow what a cool dude and i just i live like right next door to that
that's actually funny so because that's what i think about racism i think
i don't i wonder if he unironically identified as a racist that's what i mean
i don't know if i've ever seen it happen where they say like i am racist and proud you'd be like
okay that's like they they wouldn't use the word racist that's yeah that's my point black people
are worse than white people yeah my point is the one quinton says if you're racist get the fuck out
they probably said they're like well i'm not but black people are well that's why i said it was
how you define racism because some people would say if you just think there's a difference between
races you are a racist right some people don't even take the whole superiority thing into it
yeah oh oh no don't we get into that but i had a lot many many times i had a conversation with
um a good friend of mine who some people may remember um edgy sphinx aka braving ruin and
we mostly we had we had we had a talk yeah edgy was he was an edgy sphinx he's still around
but um just just not public but we talked a lot about this and we basically i think between the
two of us agreed on which is that right when people will tell you if they're racist they'll
be like oh yeah i hate them dang darkies like they'll tell you straight up you know they will
be outwardly racist they'll tell you they don't like people they'll be public about it but people
like quinton have the exact same thoughts about the lesser nature of non-white people
and they just express their racism subconsciously and covertly rather than aggressively and overtly
and i think that's the major difference between left and right wing racism they're all they're
all everyone anyone can be racist but the left and the right express that racism differently
is
that's why it's so easy to be like yeah you know nazis are bad and everyone's like yeah
of course nazis are bad because they're so overt about it it's so open and obvious
but when you have you know the left especially who are the racist i love these poor stupid
asians give them more roles like it's it's so weirdly condescending oh yeah absolutely
and i do want a genuine reaction from uh kelly marie tran about stuff like that and it you know
framed in the way of anything is kind of fucked up that people are like it's good that they cast
the asian don't you think that's fucked up like they need this and maybe maybe even quinton would
be like i didn't frame it like that though you're making it seem much worse than it is it's like
yeah but there's not a lot of difference that's the problem um and then also i i just said the
whole racist proud statement that's going to be memes it was such an easy thing to clip so i'll
happily see that in future i wonder if anybody'll take the bait on it though like someone's like
bola confirmed proud of being racist fucked up as that i doubt well aren't we all i hate dog i mean
cats all right um but yes anyway i think we're nearly out of the sex the racist section we're
going into the sex section you said the second section as well he's bringing up holdo of course
he's gonna say this is something to do with sexism with this call her diane from twin peaks
she has a direct confrontation with poe because he doesn't think that she's fit to command
poe takes over command of the ship because he thinks that her plans are gonna kill them all
because it turns out that her plans just made sense and poe's cowboy heurism has put them all
no no that's the exact opposite what movie did you watch not this one apparently not
not ever accepting that narrative that's nonsense everybody should have done what poe did in uh
it's the most rational thing to do what poe did yes yeah if your leader just tells you we're just
gonna die then what do you what are you supposed to do just be like well that is my commanding
officer i guess we'll just die he's the boss trying to tell people who write this film scenes
that don't exist i'm like it actually would have been much more forgivable if holder had said poe
we have a plan it's being enacted i'm not telling you it because i don't trust you if she said that
to him blatantly i'd be like whoa all right yeah um and that'll be great and he's told to sit the
fuck down and shut the fuck up because she just thinks that he messes things up and that if she
tells him what the plan is he's going to do something crazy and stupid and that she needs
he needs to trust it everything you played out differently much more forgivable yeah a stringent
harsh leader like um a more general actual type of general type i've been rewatching the x-files so
like acting like assistant director Skinner of being kind of on their side but being like you
messed up i don't trust you here's the ground rules get it done then that would be fine but
that's not the way it went down yeah she just tells him he sucks and that's it it's like okay
oh you suck now die and they come away from the movie having watched scenes that don't exist
and you're like uh what happened her plans are gonna kill them all but later turns out that
her plans just made sense and poe's cowboy heroism has put them all in danger the main complaint that
the character tends to be accepted didn't her command comes not just from pose over eager
attitude but also from her failing to tell anyone any of her over eager is an interesting
way to describe what poe does i guess if you don't want to die you're over eager yeah everything
is rational yes it's ridiculous i mean okay so what if poe doesn't do what he does
then what's the end he's a dead man yeah exactly it's what well i get to be more
he has every reason and can justify the entire faction you'll be a dead man and yeah so so you
have to if this is going to be your criticism you would have to put up an alternative hypothesis
right it would be what would happen instead it would be worse if he had done nothing because
i'd be like wow poe actually was comfortable with everybody dying like that's weird and you can say
that about the rest of the crew remember you have that shot where um the the girl who billy lord she
looks at holdo at one point in the film like what the fuck are you doing she just says steady on
because they watch a film get uh film they watch uh frigate the medical frigate get destroyed
don't worry that definitely won't be us next yeah the guy did the guy i keep fucking my words
up the guy dies screaming he's like it was good to save you blows up and then she's like what do
we do now she's like steady on serving you doing whatever it is our organization does
so whatever that was it was great i don't know man like it's a disaster and um i'm glad the film
had at least more than just poe disagreeing with it like the mutiny had a couple of people there
it's like oh thank christ somebody else noticed right but most people didn't and this is the other
crazy thing at that point in the film it's like they're all packing they all know they're going
to leave and uh like like why don't you ask one of the pilots where they're heading are you guys
just gonna drive off into the sunset or your actual goal to be like oh we're we're heading
to crate and then poe will be like wait what's that what is what's crate are you just tell him
at that point why would you just tell him i hate this stuff it's a minor annoyance that doesn't
really undermine the point of that part of the film but i've seen a lot of people say that it's
undermines the point of the film feminist what feminist propaganda couple things feminist
propaganda i think the the weird hair and the odd dress is something that definitely is odd i
don't know if i goes yeah the it's unusual it raises a bra let's be honest i certainly saw
videos that did kind of frame it that way oh yeah i can really use well because he was very specific
there he was talking about the process of not sharing the plan and then he was like they're
describing all this as fair but it's probably like whoa now i think people saw here as a as like an
icon of tumblr yeah but the idea of not telling the plan to people is like no that's just poor
writing it has nothing to do with feminism at least i didn't right right
no that in particular i i think that he's yeah he's probably conflating the two things like people
are saying that um she as a character was representative of an issue but this yeah they
they wanted this character to have those specific aesthetic by design and what it's associated with
i don't know if i can say that with definitive certainty but it certainly looks that way i i
think with what ryan has said and jj and disney and their whole spiel about the forces female
and stuff i i think it's a pretty safe assumption i found the picture of the swastika by the way
there's also a katina in that window remember how i showed you guys a spider
earlier there's a bigger spider that's closer to me now there's a different one
oh make them fight i'm gonna no they can both tell the future then you make it then get them
to fight and the one who doesn't want to fight would have been the one to lose no they'll maybe
whoever's gonna lose that fight would have been able to tell that from the future
yeah i know then they wouldn't want to fight then i'll never be able to make them fight i
don't make them fight no you just make them want to fight you have to put them in a tiny little
cage like a little little sticks little um you know to fuck each other with you know i'm gonna
send the picture can they change the future or is it like a rival is it what is it can they can
they change the future or is it like a rival oh i guess yeah it's all just set in stone anyway so
they know they're gonna fight if they do there's big old legs that doesn't look bigger than the
other one from like the photos it is bigger than the other one because i can see them both still
oh my fucking god why do i have two spiders in my room oh i really that do they need to
warn me about something like they're both pretty big spiders as well like which means they have
i can't just put them together and let them fight each other
what if they're like feeling female and they make you become friends what if they're coordinating
an attack i don't think so right now right now they're both like do you think he's noticed
he keeps looking spider spiders or bros he's taking a picture of each of us so maybe
spriters he's he's logged us in his uh anyway i've never just propagated back on topic
propaganda what i guess people are just triggered by tumblr hair every even he acknowledges that's
the point of the hair good like i feel like so when people are like wow why did you mention
the hair i'm like i don't know it's distracting is it not it's really weird this is supposed to
be a military organization it's unusual and then they say it's not unusual for star wars i'm like
i don't think i've seen this in star wars before but i could understand you saying that star wars
doesn't have any set rules for hair so strange i just i just get that i i guess that it's a little
bit odd because we have never seen a human in star wars with weird hair color before
it's certainly not front and center too so it hits people in a way
like a general who's like on a bridge demanding troops
i see this person and i think crazy weird person that you should really be clear about what humans
are in the star wars universe versus other like i see that stuff is that kind of stuff is all
mostly even only discussed at all in the expanded universe so i i can get the excuse but it is
distracting it's it's coded it's like you know there are clear cultural associations with that
kind of like uh i think there's i don't know i don't think anyone really knows if it was intentional
all right well she didn't just accidentally put on the dress and the hair you're saying we can't
know for sure if they were trying to um if they did this to like evoke certain connotations from
the real world or yeah i guess we can't know for sure unless we had a comment we can't know for
certain but i think it's pretty a lot of people come away with that interpretation let's say that
i just look at her and think like she looks like she's having a bit of life crisis with that
because she's always something you want to make sure that your troops understand that you are
are you saying that if a man wore a ball gun at hair she's wearing a halo as well that's always
something i forgot to mention well yeah it would just be the same thing it's just a man if i saw
like a dude wearing that exact outfit i'd assume just like that was like like his deal like he'd
always done that because you're a dirty sexist here's a here's a really weird thing that i've
noticed in the last couple of years whenever i've gone out in public i've noticed that there's this
trend of young girls who are i don't know late teens wearing not halos but crowns which i find
yeah like little tiny fake plastic crowns and i have no idea what this is about but i'm sure
it's in the same vein and i mean that's spelled in both ways because all women are queens even
the shit ones i'm yeah i hope this doesn't a thing that kicks up browns but all women are queens
the women are the bosses the women are the heroes
alex kill an efap alex please being a woman is that important to what she does in the movie
i just can't stop thinking that if this character was a guy there wouldn't have been oh but oh this
is in contradiction with pop culture detective who says her womanness is a very important part
about what the film is trying to say well they don't agree with each other even though they
probably say they do publicly but the i like the idea that he's like if this was a guy we'd be okay
with this like a guy wearing a bulldog a halo and pig flowing hair i don't know i think i'd find it
or if you're just making absolutely pants on head military decisions how about that
it didn't matter though if he could have been hold on and he was this big buff guy i would have
still had a problem with it have you seen the concept art for caldo because she looks fucking
awesome i don't know what went wrong oh no send it to us i'll put it on the screen
there's some really uh i can't find them there's some really early ones where it shows um
like our own military gear and it's like that's some cool looking
character right there i can't find them right now i'll let you know have a look at important
to what she does in the movie i just can't stop thinking that if this character was a guy there
wouldn't have been nearly as much backlash as there is and that makes me think that that backlash
really doesn't matter what makes you think that yeah exactly depending on their arguments like
it can't just be oh yeah that doesn't matter because it's just always about the argument it's
never like oh this this is a woman sorry i provide always provide your sources i mean
here's the thing i have had purple hair i don't really care about like nobody gives a shit about
that kind of stuff it's because of what a freaking um magnetic just nightmare of a character this one
is in every way if she was perfect and she only had actually it wouldn't matter what her gender
was it wouldn't matter what her what what color the hair was it's because everything else this
character does is so stupid if um if she if we could find a video saying that holdo is a terrible
character because she has people here and that's it no other arguments nothing no to qualify as
well i should be like yeah quinton that's terrible as an argument that is a very bad argument but
that's not what anyone is ever saying yeah i have i haven't heard it myself also hi shad how you
doing we're uh we're four hours in talking about how much we hang them and yeah we've just learned
the it's bad if you're racist it's also bad if you're sexist i don't know if you knew this
um don't be those we think that that bad thing doesn't matter at all i really feel like there
are a lot of good character ideas here but they're just really quickly forced into these scenes kind
of awkwardly so they they just come across as a bit comedic there's this scene where rose tells
finn about the slave trade on this city and it makes finn instantly hate the city and it that
should be fine what what are you even saying in this point i'm sorry yeah i need to i hear that
again though i yeah i don't know what he's trying to even say with this tangent these scenes kind of
awkwardly so they they just come across as a bit comedic there's this scene where rose tells finn
about the slave trade on this city and it makes finn instantly hate the city and it that should be
fine but the way no no no no no no is it not what let's explain why this might actually affect finn
quinton to say he was essentially a slave yeah he was a slave here's a reason why finn might
actually be affected by this i i can't under why would you make a review of a movie that you
clearly don't understand on even a most basic level i don't know what he means by this should be fine
like what right right well i guess we haven't heard the rest of it yet yeah this is okay sorry
it reminds me of this scene from shark nato they took me he's comparing it to shark nato okay
that's why would he do that to shark nato compare it to the last jetta now i really hate sharks too
overall i feel whoa whoa whoa that's that's dumb because okay so like the the society of which
tico is critiquing is completely contingent upon and encouraging the use of slaves to function
while sharks are a broad animal that it would make no sense to just hate a shark because
it ate someone's friends i don't know you could still could but sharks as a whole
how are these comparable not in any way so okay so a shark ate your ate your dad i'm really sorry
a shark is an animal right fuck in the case of finn i was a slave here is a city of slavers
oh why would you have any connection to this he was a slave like two days ago
i'm scratching my head and i'm trying to think of a reason i can't
also he's probably still going like holy shit i can wake up whenever i want i want to highlight
as well as we always do the irony of like this is bad we need to beat this like you got you guys
are the ones we're in control when this happened what do you mean the republic and the reason this
is going on what is it yeah the republic took over would take it over like two days ago canto
bite's been running for years to get rid of slavery on an obviously very well established
well off and well to do planet and you haven't it's just like the idea that fins like first thing
we do know that we've won is abolish slavery there's a whole bunch of like people in the senate who
are like well we you know it's not all bad they said some of the slaves want to be there okay
buddy like we yeah they love it oh it's just um i like the the kylo we find out the main motivation
behind the snoke was to abolish slavery that was his whole thing that's what he's motivated
he's like people like the jedi and forced slavery and then they're like we have to defeat you and
he's like you guys are evil this is this whole other film you think a jedi could just choose not
to be a jedi and there would be no repercussions and we're inventing a more interesting film
with we should be talking about it this is definitely becoming much more interesting
than it there's no weight will be anywhere near as interesting as this imagine that imagine snoke
was a disgruntled jedi oh we should stop because it's going to be too much fun to talk about how
that could work well we should stop because that would be too much fun yes that's what i'm trying
to say it'll it'll be the concept will be fun then we'll have to come back to reality where
we're dealing with fucking episode nine is a stupid fleet of star destroyer death star
stupid wait wait but it's gonna be really cool explosions and it will be super cool it'll look
so cool it'll look really neat okay so um i'm just gonna be sure to unplug your brain and turn it
into off mode and then you'll have a great time i'm starting to think like because i've been
looking for a while now i can't find any of that um concept art of like holdo where she was actually
military clothes does anyone in the chat know what i'm talking about because i'm starting to
think i've just made it up in my like we keep inventing better films but does anyone in the
chat know what i'm referring to because i really want it to exist at this point because that would
mean i'm not crazy well let's see um admiral holdo concept art that that's what i've been
doing for a while i've been trying different terms to find what i was what i was looking for
try fash wave oh i think i found it well i don't know this is a tumblr picture never mind
admiral holdo but not horrible
wait right what did you search to find what you thought was it because i want to see maybe
that's what i saw concept art i only found like stuff of a have her in a ballgame well
this is what i originally thought i saw let me screenshot it real quick it's that right there
this is what i thought at first it was then i was like oh no that's just tumblr person oh yeah
no that one that one looks cool but it's not what i was thinking of that one it's awesome though
she love that no one great pretty good i still have fun we have to go back to quinton
oh no oh wait go ahead though i was done oh i mean other than just saying like
oh the shit's fucking i know i've lost my even train of thought
oh let's just being stupid as hell i'm sure he'll he'll provide he'll be the vehicle for which you
completely moved off of track i can't remember what even my original gripe was
he's going to springboard you into something i swear give it 10 seconds at most i feel like
this whole part about them trying to hack some people okay people are saying that they think i
know which one uh they know which one i mean please tell me how to find it tweet at him with
it keep an eye on yes if anyone has a tweet at me tweet admiral holdo rule 34 infinite outfits
too overall i feel like this whole part about them trying to hack the hyperspace thing
it just feels like an episode of rebels half the stuff feels added is a good or bad
yeah the only reason that you understand how the characters feel about each other
is that they keep saying how they feel about each other out loud and it's not like they're
not provoked by the events of the plot that they do it like the slaves thing is obviously going to
provoke ray uh tico into talking about air history and then it should provoke fin into talking about
his history as a slave it just doesn't really yeah you know the idea that they went on a
pointless filler mission but then discussed their feelings as they went along i don't even
i'm i'm defending tlj here and i hate it it's um well i guess yeah i mean what else do you expect
them to do if you want them to have this private time what else are they supposed to do exactly
right now if anything he's he's almost being critical of something i'm like at least they
did say something to each other of interest rather than just we must find code break or
let's find code break or i am not code break or i am other code break or they will they have to
how fortunate that this has occurred let us return our conference you have to break up the
mcguffin a little bit and they could have done so much better even with the restrictions of
canto bite because we could have what we've kind of already accidentally discussed there like
fin could have this really awful reaction to the slavery and then
you know rose is like what what's going on then he could finally talk about what it was like
to be indoctrinated into the first order but no god forbid literally everyone has been wanting
since the first film is is to be like to be a stormtrooper i know how terrible
the only point of most of these scenes is just to set up stuff that is set after this
except the only point of these scenes is to set up stuff that comes later hang on
it's not every scene ever not payoffs wow jeez okay i have a lot of questions
isn't that not basically the premise of what a story is put in the idea being that whatever
you have at the end is led to by the stuff before it and vice well go on you know every
seed leads to the day oh i i don't i didn't know that that was trite i thought that was
called storytelling oh well i apparently i'm that's just fan stuff aiden stop it that's fan
stuff whoops my bad that this is the last chronological movie in the star wars universe
right now so we don't even know what that is i mean so and with that okay
this isn't the video where he says sequels are interpreted to be the mother i wish this was
oh how they feel about each other yeah just just for reference
winton believes that a sequel is only a sequel if you interpret it as a
i'm waiting for aiden to react to that
uh you know what uh my brain has shut down and is now trying to restart like a shitty del computer
it's what
and then when you think about the fact that commentary this stupid like a lot of people
watch it and think it's good and you're like damn what happened to like the species the species
humans you gotta do better i legitimately don't even know what he's talking about by that um
i the the best interpretation i guess i could have is you can enjoy a movie as its own thing
and ignore everything that came before it which i'd be like yay can do that yeah you can doesn't
make it not a sequel it's still a sequel exactly okay i suppose what he's asking
is that he wants to be able to take things as independent works of art and that's that's a
fine thing and we should do that to some extent but when a piece of media is a part of a series
we must inherent also take in context the medium in which it currently exists within it's impossible
to separate the media from the medium and from its context universally it's just impossible yeah
and as much as it may benefit your analysis to be like if you ignore all of space travel before tlj
tlj space travel seems like it kind of works you'd be like okay but nothing else about tlj works
without the stuff before it how does right how does ray work without how does luke work without
the stuff before it like it's pretty confusing a great example actually i think it works better
without context sorry sorry what oh he said he's saying that luke works better in tlj without
context um i think i could agree with that actually yeah yeah um i i would say a good example though
is i'm more of a trackie that i am a star wars fan actually and in star in star trek 4 they go
back around the sun really really fast to go back in time this had been kind of established in earlier
star trek episode but it's bullshit it's stupid and it's made up and it's it's fake but because
it's within the contextual stuff they've already set up that it makes sense and you can do stupid
stuff with it and the audience will be more accepting of it but you have to have set it up
and even if it hasn't been previously established you have to give the audience a good reason to
believe why it might be the case that's all and then people will go along but that's if you don't
provide any rationale people will question it you can't just say that's nerd stuff you know
underestimating his power oh no also you've been sent something on twitter jay that i'm now looking
at i don't know if this is what you were aiming for with uh is it her in a in a shirt well i think
i'd call it that but i'll just send it to you is that loose to what you're looking at that is
not i don't think no i'm just i'm beginning to think that what i'm thinking of just doesn't
christ okay uh i clicked another link someone sent me a rule 34 um oh sorry no um i'm starting
to think that what i i'm thinking of just doesn't exist and i have a false memory okay loud and the
only point of most of these scenes is just to set up stuff that is set after this i want to highlight
by the way i'm totally gonna nitpick his video it's the quality of that jpeg while he's been using
images from the actual like video from the movie why couldn't he just screenshot this from the movie
i don't know what's beneath j you have like png and then jpeg what's beneath jpeg
i mean a lot of people this is like a deep fried meme almost yeah deep fried yeah loud and the
only point of most of these scenes is just to set up stuff that is set after this except that this
is the last chronological movie in the star wars universe right now so we don't even know what that
is and with that out of the way it's time to talk about i don't think this movie sets up anything
like you know the idea that like it's up to jj to figure out what this movie set up because
there's no leading the audience to anything really it's just open and some might say that's
good i wouldn't pissingly i feel like yeah it's almost applied you may as well because this is
the end of the duology the sequel duology the next film feels like it'll have to begin a new
set of stories which it probably will i guarantee jj will end episode nine with a whole bunch of like
like oh where does that go there might be like a scene where something happens between some people
um it doesn't go anywhere in the film we're like i wonder what that's gonna end the film like
ray's probably not gonna die and she'll be like it's up to me to blah blah blah and be like oh
i wonder if there'll be another trilogy with ray or we'll just hear about ray's exploits you know
like i hope it's really open-ended but with with with goals people have goals they have things
they're gonna do unlike tlj which is just let's restart the resistance you're like okay there's
like 20 of us right if we can do it i'm sure everyone abandoned us on crate but i'm sure of it
i can't remember whose theory it was but someone said in this year gap we've got they'll be um
they would have made a deal with some planet to get some resources and that's going to be their army
i reckon that it'll they'll say that it's luke's story that inspired a bunch of systems to join them
or something
i ironically wouldn't be that surprised if they have an end credit scene
oh my oh they're probably will be they probably freaking will be yeah i'll have to stay i have to
stay for that what the things that happen in the last jedi that people actually care about
the bit that has the last jedi i love this film's take on luke skywalk oh god you're so terrible
oh i love it just the worst just the worst take uh you're just a worthless terrible commentator
aren't you i feel like he's a contrarian he he wants to take the worst take i mean it does line
up yeah uh i've always appreciated rich evans's take on on luke skywalker being that he loves the
idea of luke being disenfranchised with the force and the jedi execution though that's a whole other
thing and i'm in the same boat i'm like yeah i could have seen a story where luke becomes
disenfranchised but you gotta write it you can't just skip can't do that exactly i love it can and
he will epic story of passion and redemption uh passion i guess there's emotions luke is yeah
when i see luke skywalk i'm like yeah that there's a guy who's fucking passionate i came to this
island to die i'm passionate about dying he didn't even do it right it took him like 30 years to not
die how do you fuck up dying for 30 years he's like i'm sure this milk will poison me eventually
30 seconds ding dong i'll get calcium poisoning and then um redemption yeah because i guess
he created kylo ren and kylo ren is evil that's he's redeeming himself for that
oh so much to do in terms of but you know now he's gonna go into much more detail than that
for that bit let's see where else he goes who decided that the universe was better off without
him turning his back on his own legacy out of hatred for his own failures luke has always been
one of the most interesting characters in the entire star wars don't you know how many simmers
his failures that that clearly sometimes it's just like we need more context was he a really
bad teacher that could have been cool to see if that was true that would have been neat yeah like
he just he doesn't have the patience of why kylo ren yeah or why why kylo he's a bad teacher so
like one of students like can i go to the bathroom he's like i don't know can you i don't
think that's a fun teacher i like a teacher that's the entire motivation for kylo he's like he did
let me pee when i wanted i don't know i'm imagining those being the flashbacks now and
like there's three different takes on the first flashback is like kylo demanding to go to the
bathroom in the luke is like you need to ask more politely then the second take is luke's version
where uh no the second take is kylo's version where kylo's like i i asked politely and luke uh
luke just took out his lightsaber and swung it at me like how dare you ask to go into the bathroom
and then the real take is just kylo asking you the bathroom he's like no um like creation said he
kept jumping off the cliff but the force kept saving him now i've just pictured like this dark
thing where he keeps trying to kill himself but yoda keeps showing up and stopping him with the
force and he's laughing while doing it like luke jumps off the cliff he picks up he goes
for free try you might but you will not kill yourself he's like luke's like crying and he's
trying to cut his wrists and yoda keeps pulling the blade away like no the whole audience are
just like mouth the gape like what am i watching this is so fucked up i will pay-per-view that
they have like happy music in the back are like
luke's just crying i would pay-per-view the shit out of this
like i said so doc but i feel like it would be more fun than tlj the most interesting characters
in the entire star wars universe and that's partially because just like his father the person
that he eventually becomes is totally different from the kid we meet on tatooine yeah but at least
we know how anakin turned from anakin to darth vader prequels almost like they spent three movies
explaining movies to establish that yeah yeah i'm not gonna say it's perfect but i get the events
with luke it was all this stuff that we get and throw away lines it's like wow don't you think
that the movies should be about that that sounds like the most important thing but nah almost
people often complain that luke is too whiny in episode four but honestly it's that childlike
glamour and do-good nature that makes his transformation in episodes five and six even
more compelling and i honestly believe that luke's journey in episode eight is the perfect
bookend to that story luke starts oh my god the perfect bookend to his journey oh my god this is
the bookend to luke skywalker oh my goodness that sounds terrible oh my god how much do you hate luke
skywalker why do you hate this person why do you see a white male and think yeah we can't have that
be successful they cast luke as a jet lee and he was like i'm so glad that they cast an asian
actor for luke skyward we'd be like what i have to ask a question how hard do you think it is to
wake up as quinton and you know you get up in the morning you have your orange juice you eat your
bacon your eggs then you go to the bathroom you brush brush your teeth and you look in the mirror
and you see fucking a white male no how do you think you respond to that i mean it's got
go in blackface and be like i'm not racist anymore he'd be like no quinton no no you're doing it no
pull that backwards non-racism that turns into racism i think he would he wants to be asian
more than he wants to be black i think what about ablation like shout out to myself for identifying
as asian shout out to myself that sounds like quinton reviews does he bow to himself in the
mirror he makes him he may starts making memes about how he's asian oh yeah because he fucking
posts memes about himself being cool did you see that aidan that was embarrassing yes no one does
that oh my that's no that's how you know when it's time to stop on youtube or at least to have a
course correction you'd have a word it's like i think pretty highly of myself if you haven't
noticed and i wouldn't do that i've never noticed that rags not no not not right you self-deprecate
all the time rags i don't know what you're talking about oh yeah because um hmm i'm sure there's an
example home planet as a poor farmer boy who is taught to know and trust the ways of the jedi
and he spends the next several years coming to grips not only with the teachings of the jedi
but also with who he is as a person and his shocking lineage and he succeeds in destroying
the sith and the empire only to see new evil rise from the ashes the galaxy chronicles luke
is a hero and but it's because of him that they rise to a degree from what we understand he just
lets it happen like you almost implied with that little summary that it's like no matter his
attempts to stop them they still come it's like yeah well again i'd rather see that i'd rather see
it be like there's a new sith rising and luke has this realization like we defeated them it's like
can't defeat evil yeah it's fucking weird isn't it now let's have some explaining
but in fairness the emperor's not dead so oh god oh i don't know the emperor's not dead
protector of all that is good and in buying into that vision of himself
he allows his own fear to put he did those things he was the protector of all that was good
like you're making this up now because it's like oh he believed in his own legend and that's why
he failed it's like we didn't see any of that he just woke up kylo in the middle of the night was
like hey it was lightsaber hey i had a dream that you were gonna be a bad dude so i'm gonna kill
you kid okay that's very rational by the way people have argued it's like he didn't try to kill
him and it's like why'd he pull out the lightsaber it's like he just he was just it it's just looking
at the lightsaber it's a night light it's a night light he was just like man my lightsaber's cool
this is distracting thing to look at it might have been cold he was warming up kylo
good point jay if lightsabers are infinite could they power something are they a source of infinite
energy well no they have energy sources inside them kind of no we never see one run out of
batteries therefore they can't uh well but not everyone can activate it because you need to have
access to the forest because you can't turn a knob even though well no because
no no no but he's black okay it's it's i guess it depends on your
Han Solo is black but Han Solo is black and technically yeah anybody can turn it on i guess
but you should anyone can be black that's true anybody can be black i suppose you could argue
that Han Solo and Finn are four sensitive in a limited degree they are four sensitive they are
well Han Solo definitely is and i i think we could probably argue that with Finn as well
so who couldn't like like Watto he wouldn't be able to Jabba probably not i don't know i i don't
fucking know like i i'm not wait hang on hang on Grievous can and he's not full sensitive
he can't use the force at all right oh no no um Grievous okay so Grievous is black well when he
dies he's black no Grievous is particular because his spirit is basically being run through the
machinery so um he can yeah it's still his force his midichlorians or whatever is still being run
through the robot body fair enough i don't know enough about it works from my understanding of
how that works and i could be completely wrong on that some people probably call me an idiot but
my understanding of the science behind this is how i understand that that Grievous works we need
we need that Star Wars girl she'll she'd probably know um which one day is it'll happen that Star
Wars girl which one yeah that one okay Aiden Paladin is that Star Wars girl no i no i'm i'm
a Trekkie i can i can tell you you want Star Trek who can wield a phaser explain that
hey i made a joke that not even rags wait rags do you get it
who can shoot a phaser a wheeled one anybody wield a phaser because phasers are in Star Trek
i'm gonna move on now this is ruining the joke by explaining
the arms of his enemies logically at this point Luke finally comes to understand that the rise
of evil in the galaxy has been caused not only by the strength of figures like the Sith but also by
the hubris and blind conceit of the um no no that's done though the well both in the prequel
sense and in the the idea that the jedi the reason the palpatine rose or something i just
like that's so unfair i really wanted to debate Luke in TLJ when he says shit like that like
let's have a sit down a second all right because you you're you're all over the place the idea
that the jedi are the people that allowed or almost facilitated Palpatine's rise to power
like do you really think that you like that's insane they literally tried to kill him to stop
him yeah like this is what i mean i'm just like this bullshit you're stupid the senate are way
more the reason the jedi are like separated from the senate and they're the ones that were much
more in favor of getting rid of Palpatine the other ones are trying to police that event
happening while the senate were like yeah he's a good guy not to say i'm not even saying he's
stupid i'm actually advocating that he's just got a very biased view of history like you gotta
consider the actual events and i just i don't like it are you saying that events just happen yeah
only if Luke's feeling only he could talk to Yoda about these events if only
just the Yoda's not around that would be really convenient wouldn't it
fucking Yoda watching him for 30 years just crumple up into a shriveled acorn like i hate
everything and he's like um why did you hear the jedi we did everything we could man we really did
i mean you could argue they could have done more or could have been smarter or Yoda shouldn't have
ran off to the swamp and stuff but it might have made sense if they had actually done okay
first of all these movies were a bad idea in the first place but if you want to spin off
movies they should have done old republic stuff to show the actual faults in the jedi order and
their flaws careful what you wish for no i don't really i don't want this i'm saying the idea of a
the idea of a jedi civil war is an interesting one it is but it's also an interesting idea that
that the force is not this omnipotently good um thing in the way that it's it's often
a portrayed or understood by many people and i think that that would have been a thing they
could have done to make that make more sense because otherwise it just looks like Luke
decided out of nowhere that the jedi teachings were bad and that it was all you know horse crap
it it has no context otherwise yeah the idea that the force is just the force and it doesn't
care about morality it's just a it's a it's an essence it's a thing it's a something that's
ill-defined but understood partially and you could mess with it and stuff but it doesn't
really care what you do i mean it's like science it's completely a moral thing what you do with
it is up to you no we established earlier the science has morals because when ryan johnson
releases a movie the sky cries oh yeah oh yeah that's right and the thing is tears of joy
up till now though the viewers have not had and and this is totally ignoring because people always
bring this up which is very frustrating oh the expanded universe expanded universe yes yes yes
we accept that but as long outside people who have read the expanded universe stuff the average viewer
has no idea about the complexities of the force and decanonized good good versus evil which is
how it it was more you know generally speaking in the original um trilogy is very good versus evil
um but people don't understand how there are potentially nuances to that which are still used
in the last july but not elaborated upon so it makes them meaningless outside of context yeah
also um someone said he wasn't on the island for 30 years of course he was probably on it for like
15 or 10 i don't know how long but anything longer than like a week if he was there for years yeah
like the point is that yoda could have talked to him that's that's that's a big issue i have
and yoda only turns up at like right before everything's dead doesn't the first line of
force away can say luke sky auger has vanished implying that it's recent so it's been there for
two days i don't think he's been there for two days they've been searching for him that's how long
it's been isn't it didn't he i thought wait hang on i thought the whole point was that he disappeared
the second kylo left the student area yes that was years ago we don't know how long ago that
was do we uh it would have had to have been at least a few years though there's no way it was more
than five i would say it's a fair question i don't know if they have definitive units of time to
to tell us exactly how long any of that specifically happened but even if an hour like that's how
ridiculous i'm getting here like yoda should have done something yoda should have done something
back in the student area he should have been there it should be like hey guys that point if
you look and show up at any point that he wants to to communicate why did he not show up and say
luke don't fucking kill the kid we kill the kid you shouldn't you know like luke's walking towards
luke's walking towards like kylo's hut and yoda appears with his hands in front of himself like
don't i know what you're thinking don't i know what you're gonna do just don't he's like what
do you mean he's like you'll stand over him you can open up the lightsaber don't
does not go well my man also that doesn't explain the whole myth thing does it if luke only
disappeared for like a few days i thought he was a myth nothing explains the myth shit no
oh i thought i thought that looks like it's ray being stupid
like five years old when all this shit came crashing down right in front of my face i
thought it was the revolutionary war is just a myth i was gonna say jay that doesn't even make
sense that she treats him as a myth and yet knows hun solo really well well isn't that odd right
you do you think that their stories would overlap to some degree some degree um also and pax has
corrected us as well it's unrealistic force ghosts only appear to burn books that is
uh
i lo destroying the temple was six years ago according to shuster
what is shuster what is shuster oh it's a person i think
i don't know where the reference for that is exactly
well in chat by the way i didn't get that from a website is from a chat
um anyway carry on quinton i hate to interrupt you mistakes that they were making and so luke
appointed by yoda himself as the last jedi would cut himself far from the force and the galaxy to
die the death that he would seem to deserve which would make much more sense if the world wasn't
currently at the whims of a fucking sith lord you know what i mean is this a lude just a little bit
i think i think you could have chosen a better time to do this luke that's my take my opinion
like you don't like the jedi and you want the force to stop and you want people to stop using
it you'd be like i'm gonna cut myself off it's like yeah but dude the whole universe is getting
ripped apart right now he's like what could they possibly have to go i don't know base that can
destroy five planets at once he's like yeah all right talk to me when we get to eight or nine
uh it's implied by the film after the destruction of the temple that luke went back to layer and
told her what happened except that he started it all then sometime afterward left to act two
he's such an asshole he left without telling any of them as well
like they're all panicking i'm the savior of the galaxy just don't worry about it if you know
i'm stuck really like i you know that's a sound that sounds so in line with luke's character
doesn't it like i'm gonna take a hot take and it is friends i don't like luke in the sequel
trilogy myself i'm saying it i'm putting it out there brave i know racist oh no yeah
you just don't like the decision to make luke the figure that pushed kylo to the dark side of
the force since in episode six he sees good in his father and helps him find a way to redemption
by the logic of these fans luke would never turn his lightsaber on to someone he holds compassion
for and certainly no no okay not all the sleeping no what let's let's all yeah point out something
i'm sure you guys have seen is it not interesting that anytime anybody wants to defend one of the
new films they have to attack the old ones yeah they can't go after the problems of these movies
as quinton said in the beginning i'm not going to go over my own problems with the film instead
it's let's look at the issues with the old movies that i can pick apart that's not a criticism of
the film to give you um deflection before we counter argue where he's obviously going
if someone said i've watched a lot of efap mauler would never pull a gun on rags i even i would be
like no i i think there's a time where i could and you're like what if rags threaten my whole
family i'd be like probably would be considered as like rags literally has a machine gun trained on
all of my family i'd be like yeah i'd pull a gun at him i think i'd be like and so uh you'd be like
so how so what you're saying luke would pull a lightsaber on a family member or friend i'd be
like uh is that family member threatening to kill his other loved members of his family then yeah
you're like oh well that's kind of happening in return of the judo i guess kind of but it's
really the same as walking into your nephew's bedroom while he's asleep and pulling a lightsaber
on him isn't it no oh it's not yeah it's the same it's opposite the same fucking same stop it i find
it very funny though i find it very amusing though that don't you understand oh no it's just that
that it's it's seriously like one rule for this one film and then so this movie can get away with
all this stuff whatever it wants to do that's fine we can't address those issues instead we have to
go back to the other previous existing films and criticize them for instead for the exact same
flaws while not addressing that the film that's actually being critiqued has those flaws i find
yeah why does every the last jedi review turn into a review empire strikes back why i don't get it
and uh i just it's well i do get it but it's frustrating i just hate the broad conflations we
had it with endgame and helms deep you just like what is the connecting tissue it's like well
what what connects the scene where luke challenges vader and the scene in which luke drinks milk
in tlj you go well both have luke in it so it makes sense that luke would drink the milk from
that creature in that film while wanting to kill himself because he's in it and he was in this film
you're like that's just you gotta do better than that clattery it rhymes
and you know people being like well he pulled a lightsaber on vader he pulled a lightsaber on
kylo that's good enough it's like what about contacts no no no he did the action nope
not for a member of his own family and to that all i have to say is uh
oh you know that point where he was emotionally manipulated
and to the highest extent that you can do to a person by like threatening everything they
possibly care about and what did vader say before he did that vader was like sister your thoughts
betray you he's like it's gonna fucking go after it didn't kiss her did you because that would be
super weird i hate the the removal of context is so completely different and and also oh this
makes me so angry too where it's like um yeah this idea that that i'm sorry i'm getting i'm
fucking frustrated this it's a little hard to follow kind of because it's almost so nonsensical
yeah i was gonna say the structure of this video is horrific okay plus right the idea
just to be like this is this emotional outbreak is is is bad in some way isn't like the lesson
that he learns in this scene not to do this shit like exactly yes what would he like having had
this experience i would be willing to bet that he would not do it again that you know the next time
someone's baiting him to fight that he's gonna go no the film i think the film's arguing this is
the entry level to dark side the door flew open and luke was like whoa shit i nearly just walked
right through that no that's exactly what it's showing is that this is the that that luke is
going to the dark side we've seen that we see that extremely explicitly clearly so i'm not sure why
this is supposed to be i mean the scene is supposed to be negative and it's supposed to show the
audience that this is our our hero you know falling to the dark side i don't get what else is supposed
to mean he thinks he thinks pull out a lightsaber on his nephew he thinks it's uh facts and logic
and beat the fuck out all of us because he said that luke wouldn't pull a lightsaber on a loved
one that's what he thinks we said but that's not the context is completely removed from this
particular scene um and the idea that they're like well okay fine let's delve a little deeper but
let's stay nice and vague vader was threatening his family members while kylo he had a dream
where kylo oh sorry not a dream he looked into kylo's head and saw kylo killing people
though it's really the same if you think it's like no it's not let's talk about anakin let's
talk about anakin anakin is given a dream to believe that padme is going to be killed that's
why he does everything that he does to stop it right so then there you cannot say there's
any difference between any of these characters in that sense at least so i'm not sure you'd think
what exactly the argument is see it could have been so good because what if luke kept looking
into kylo's mind and seeing that exact same future no matter what he did to try and alter
it he just kept seeing it that would be more interesting but it's one time that's all we've
got it's like i looked into his heart and i saw a darkness it's like um like that one time vader
was like the epitome of darkness you still saved him like what the hell exactly it's i'm sorry like
people really do struggle with this one who believe luke was completely in character
and i i sometimes i'm just like are you you just want to see this emotional payoff without
getting there in a pathway and so you're willing to ignore the pathway i want to see luke fuck up
more i like a flawed character like yeah no no true exactly but we had to get there we can't
just jump you have to see him screw up because otherwise the gravitas of him recognizing his
own faults has none it's it's meaningless and it's it's pointless that not only does the audience
have to recognize that what the character did was wrong the character themselves has to recognize
and come out stronger through the other side that's the character arc
i have a good stories
yes a long ass fucking time ago
it's a town called gigapattoo
i don't know the person who knows that reference
i don't know it
god damn it chat will know it i i trust chat chat know all the references i'm gonna wait
now i'm not gonna i'm not gonna hit play until i see someone in chat recognize my reference
for myself i drink while i'm doing it someone's spamming wasn't world war two or myth into the
chat i found a quinton video is improved by alcohol
i already yeah i already finished one off it's tough oh look at that chat knew it instantly
good job guys i always trusted you yo i'm gonna go grab a drink as well everyone in chat go grab
a drink simultaneously 4000 people just get up to the fridge grab a well actually no go for
something alcoholic okay natures d movie man it's good shit
um all right i'm ready to play but i shall wait for the return of the people how's everyone doing
tonight we're five we're nearly five hours in we've still got less than half the video to go and
and uh super chats to read out as well it's it's gonna be another long one um i mean the first ever
long one we usually don't go over two hours on that's not usual that wall discussion you know it
just it just took some time you had a great time yeah people have been asking for uh time stamps
here and there and i'm like i'm not against time stamps or anything but i will say that the efab
website of which i will 110 million percent endorse um if you go to the episode like guides
if you will uh all the timestamps are actually on there so instead of me copying them down and
placing them into every uh description of every fap that exists i would just say just you can use
it as a guide for anybody who's like big into efab and wants to um see certain parts i guess um and
when you scroll along the little bar at the bottom of the video you can see the yes like the efap
logo change into the what we're responding to yeah like if you wanted to see us only respond
to quinton just all you need to do is scroll until you see the his video start to be played
and then just go to the beginning of it um that's what i do a podcast where i know that they've
covered something that's what i do um what i'm super interested in is the do you know about this
rags like the seasons of efap have arcs in them do you know about this no i've heard of it so
in season one it's the quinton arc because i think there's a uh it ends with the finale episodes eight
nine and ten are all about quinton and season two is the eric taxon and jack st ark is it the
finale is with them as well then you go season three part one is the captain marvel arc because
there's three episodes that end that season with um or end that half season with captain marvel is
the um the i am that i am that robbie uh brown table and legal legal all in a row then season
three part two is the spider-man arc and the race to 50 i thought these were kind of clever it's
like oh they do kind of match so i wonder what the arc for 50 51 plus will be efap drop me yes
the website that everyone should check out there's a link in the description it's it's got all your
efap needs in it um the quinton redemption arc maybe one day it's funny if like i know it sounds
like a bait but i'd be like quinton if you just guessed it on efap once and we behaved like a
normal human you'd probably like gain a whole bunch of respect no you're completely right
if if quinton would just be willing to like talk to anybody i think he could really
fix some things but if you've seen him when he's talked about it it's clear that he
he looks down so much on other people that he would never do that do you remember the whole um
once he said fuck trump and people were like can you not keep politics out please like it's
really distracting and then he's like look if you hate trans people i don't want you watching my
videos i mean i don't know how much you watched his twitter because i watched it just out of
like morbid curiosity and it was because i don't really pay attention to twitter but i would i
would very often see the stuff he because i know he i don't know if he has a blockbot but i know
he has a lot of people blocked he didn't block me until i outright pointed out the fact that he
his contra points thing i was like that's some very funny shit that
three weeks ago you were sucking her off and now you're like i need to write a new video about how
i was wrong about contra points who can help me write it and that happened very quickly and as
soon as i pointed out he blocks me but the shit that i've always seen in post has always been very
very um i think he just goes along with whatever he thinks is the right thing to say
and i don't know if he has real opinions or not well he's trying to get in with a certain crowd
he wants to get close to this crowd in a self-professed you know they take really well to
you know certain opinions they're very they're a very tolerant bunch well apparently i didn't even
know about this because i wasn't around back then but he tried to get into the to the skeptic crowd
right all right so that picture with him or he had a picture off them okay well mattox is in
that picture too does that make mattox a skeptic i don't know my point is um i don't i had never
heard of him as being one of the skeptics i mean no i'd never if you know me like i i know every
i know almost everybody in the quote unquote skeptic community to some degree like uh to some
degree there's some that i've like never interacted um and it's hard to know who's in skeptic i guess
you know whatever you even mean by skeptic it's such a ill-defined i i've hung out in in real
life with like sargon and the quartering and dank and stuff like that and and not just this year
but for years now in terms of like the skeptic community can be a bunch of stuff but they're all
just normal people but i think that i i think that when i watched his video about the contour points
stuff and he talked about how he met her at the cheesecake factory and all of a sudden he felt
welcomed he's always looking for something to jump onto in terms of a bandwagon and if that
pattern wagon is being a contrarian then that's the bandwagon he wants to jump on
originally he thought if you jump onto the skeptic bandwagon i guess and then realized
that that well was dry because let's be honest it's very very cringy but um in some ways
and then um that didn't work out so he said well okay i'll jump onto a new bandwagon
and uh this is a bandwagon that even even h bomber guy said that between his videos he discovered
what bread tube was and it's already falling apart and he has no idea like he hasn't even
recognized it has any idea about it like the idea being that even people in the quote unquote
skeptic community might be like i'm not a skeptic i never wanted that label yeah it's
what does that mean who's a part of it you've been labeled that i mean do you consider yourself
a skeptic right i mean a skeptical person sure right right but the no i don't consider myself
part of the skeptic oh did you end up did did you ever end up on the on the research lists
i i didn't i i looked for myself though i was really hoping that i would be on it
but i wasn't okay so i was very disappointed i was labeled as alt light so of course um paul the
tolerable said that he at one point wanted to be in channel awesome so there you go that's the third
one i would say channel awesome is a little different than a whole well who does channel
awesome comprise i guess well it's not political at all as far as i remember yeah i get why you'd
say like going from skeptics to breadtubers there's there's a political angle with that
but if we're talking at it that's not actually even why i that's not why i brought it up it was
because one is like a channel a small it's like saying oh wait wait wait channel awesome wasn't
just a channel um back in the day that's what i was it was like a huge collective of um i want to
say like 50 like it's what you could call peak or maybe not peak but um uh it was a um a network
yeah sort of before there were real networks it was like a brand you could attack so how many
how many like channel how big was channel awesome probably about 50 people i was gonna say really
that's crazy right before it crashed like the website i feel like it went up to like 100 they
start accepting all kinds of people and then it what crashed well the thing is that you could
create any kind of thing you wanted for their you know business uh as long as they approved you
and originally there was a higher sort of standard for um acceptance and then that went down over
time as you need more people but there was other stuff that went on obviously the lots of stuff
with the channel awesome drama that's confusing that even i don't understand since i was never a fan
honestly it has like is louis rossman part of the skeptic community you know who knows no louis
rossman's just just a uh computer repair guy who's kind of a libertarian this is what i was
gonna get out though like it almost seems like well that's what it takes for a lot of people
if you're a libertarian if you're if you're a an anti sjw type then yeah or hell even if you're
apolitical you could be a skeptic red tube wasn't something that breadtubers created it was a label
thrust upon them and they they weren't even on board with it and it seems that way with let's
call half of skeptics like half of people who are considered skeptics were probably like i'm not
what is that i don't tell me what the label means i'll tell you man like it comes because they call
themselves skeptics at first though right well amit skeptic called himself amit skeptic
because he did like religious you know he is atheist channel so he was a skeptic i mean it's
like the amazing atheist and logic does like are there is dark matter and potholer are they
the skeptic community you're like i don't really know it's weird so it's so amorphously defined
here's a very interesting thing is that groups are perceived of and and therefore the um uh
anti-activity of a group is manifest in two different ways via the way that is perceived
by outside observers and the way by which the boundaries are defined by the internal group
members shit there's people say you're being deliberately obtuse regs you know who the skeptics
are is like no not right i know people who are called skeptics i just gave a bunch of words to
say the complexity of it in a really cool like scientific way that says that basically people
define themselves and other people define other people the way that they want to define them
i've been called a skeptic but i don't call myself a skeptic so who's right you have all four
categories people who are called it and consider themselves it people who are called it and don't
consider themselves it people who are called it and but you know you know i'm going with that like
the um it's it's complicated and which one is the more valid statement the ones that are
considered it or the ones that identify as it because you have like for instance um thunderfoot
and sargon are politically different but they're both skeptics to a degree we're supposed to all be
skeptics right to a degree well okay this is why i find so this is what i find so funny so in science
right um here's how science works and i don't mean like the i fucking love science i'm going
to look at some pictures of some cells that have died added to them they look really fucking neat
while i smoke my joint no problem with the last bit by the way fully on board with that the problem
is you don't fucking love science i'll give you a little bit of shit on fucking science um people
react to things in a pretty consistent way because we're just animals right okay anyone who thinks
that we're anything other than animals is deluding themselves we're jesus's children i'm so sorry but
the fact of the matter is that everybody fucking reacts to shit the exact same way
what this means is that people tend to have groups that they prefer and groups that they prefer less
that's all that it is that's all that all of this is is just tribalism it's very simplistic
i don't disagree but um yeah labeling you'll find that me and rag's aren't too happy with
labels in general like any like if you go oh are you x you're like well what does x mean to you
because if i agree and it turns out your definition of x is all this stuff that i don't agree with
then that was a pointless thing for me to agree with you know like it's better to just actually
get a little bit more into the details but um why am i saying that in a world that we have right now
where whether or not people will listen to my reviews begins with wait what am all his politics
though is he a and then label and it's like i think people find it easier but in a way we would
we were addressing earlier how um once you discover those things it does sort of save you time like
should i listen to this person well i need to know a few basic things and then i'll give him a shot
because i don't want to waste my time that sort of thing there's some pragmatic element to it but
it's also very um destructive to conversation
classifications are helpful if they universally agreed upon but all too often they are not
yes theo words only have one definition no nothing is universally agreed upon wait
aiden do you know about this we had a guest once who said words only have one definition
i'm
in a moment what is mola's tax policy words only have one definition
who gets to determine that which definition it is clearly google big idias the right one of course
what i do i do trust big idias to have the right call there so i want to know what the
policy is yeah what's that guy's name the amazing republican oh the the remarkable republican that's
it remarkable republican he gets to decide republican is a person yes he believes that
taiwan lannister is the apex homosexual he believes that we need to establish a strict
uh a strictly enforced christian theology on mars well you know what on the planet named after
a fucking roman god what do you think what do you think the christians have been doing
for 2000 years rags i don't know i'm gonna ask you questions like that he's just a doggo
he don't know oh by the way we were watching a quinton video i don't know if any of you guys
remember oh yeah fine whoops so let's talk about how ruining luke was was great say is uh
context is important remembering this movie i've heard at least one person no you're just a fucking
idiot you don't put things in the context which i really need to do to make this work
i don't really know what he has exactly pulled up here
but i really like the fact that it looks like a high school
submission i like that it's like a literature class you're trying to figure out where this
person stands in terms of this like a little essay i need to read the part where he says
i had a really intense personal reaction to luke skywalker depressed asshole i thought i should
explain i can't believe they did this
you and me too buddy we're still talking about it and it's been what now we're coming up to two years
jesus can you believe that guys we're nearly up to two years two months away three months away
sorry i believe when people say ryan johnson made an unforgettable star wars movie they were
right no i believe it can be forgotten i believe i don't i honestly don't think so i would like
for it to be well i don't know it's a it's a perfect example of a terrible movie that it's
like a case study but here's the thing what makes it a perfect example right is because um in terms
of the quality of the film in terms of just the the um production values right super high quality
oh yeah yeah so it shows people who are i would say that it's a great film to study
to show people who are studying film that it's not just about big flashy visuals
it's not i mean in the u.s market maybe it is in china we have some evidence for that
but you can't just racism china's a nationality right yeah that's a nationality they just say
bigotry implying that all chinese are asian you racist just say bigotry it's the easy way out
you know this reminds me of something that that richard nixon once said which is that
you mean american hitler yeah at least i'm gonna quote richard nixon correctly and by this i mean
quoting him out of a parody quote from saturday night live is that not all uh chinks are gooks
but all gooks are chinks that's important you gotta keep your stuff i don't know what that
second word means wow really you don't it's jay i don't all right you want to teach him no
well jay once again google will have to be your parent for the day
you'll be fine i don't know my point was a large fictional lizard that stands on two legs
a large fictional is it is that what you got for kook why would it be a real
lizard that stands on two legs that's really large why one of those real lizards walks around on his
hind legs maybe they're all eight feet tall and as smart as a human uh they're also stronger and
faster than most humans we know that we know that they hang out in warm climates such as jamaica
australia and eat coconuts they eat coconuts oh shit oh i'm i'm glad they eat coconuts think
about what they do to a human yeah imagine if they ate people oh man oh no
anyway go ahead the point is people are fucking racist and it's stupid and who gives a fuck
here's the picture that comes up i'm sorry
wait a minute wait a minute oh god
that's just it's the purple monster from it's grimace why is grimace the fictional lizard
oh my what does grimace what is that a tail is that a tail no it's just dainty valorine
oh wait oh no no it has that is a tail he's got a lightning tail at the end and i think that the
udders are those his legs i think he's wearing a crown too i hope those aren't teeth that's his feet
right those are the absolute hair on this man
johnny bravo purple
so anyway back to good old uh good old quitting let's do it oh yeah please don't steal my grimace
i think you guys are selectively remembering this movie i've heard at least one person say
that luke's anxiety and self-hatred in this film serves as an important representation of these
real world feelings he is so caught up in the one second of regret that he made in training kylo
that he blames himself for all of the destruction caused by his fallen apprentice anakin skywalker
fell because he grew to seclude himself and take everything that he once represented and he was
then redeemed and resurrected because of a figure who he wasn't resurrected he he died he means
metaphorically yes i mean force ghost like he became a force ghost but he was also a resurrection
and we could say oh but i guess because he came out of the dark side so you could say that yes
he's he's no if you come back as a ghost that doesn't count as resurrection no but it means
he's brought back into the form of the good side like i said metaphorical resurrection i'll i'll
allow it i will as well i'd say that that's yeah i don't know i don't either luke skywalker meanwhile
was so afraid of what the future would hold and how he might fail why wouldn't he ever be though
as a character what have we ever seen about luke skywalker at the end of the trilogy this is the
thing right give you that kind of impression if you told me um we were making a trilogy about the
fall of luke skywalker i'd be like all right how are we gonna do this and then you say um he's
gonna be poor in terms of a trainer he's going to train a family member to become a jedi who is
going to become someone who falls to the dark side but not because of themselves intrinsically
it's gonna be hugely tied to how luke trains i might be like this is gonna be tough we're gonna
have to really because luke is very much almost like he's very much a hero so you're gonna we
have to figure out how to do this you have to tie it to stuff we've learned about him all this other
stuff like what i'm trying to say is we have to do all this legwork in this one trilogy focused on
this one story and i'm still worried about how we're going to be able to translate it to audiences
they did it in a flashback that lasted like 10 seconds like to me that's beyond insulting
fuck you this is this is again i i know i've said this before but if i was told to take up for jj
and make episode eight and you have to make luke uh motivated by all the stuff he does i'd be like
jesus christ we've got so much flashbacks to do like we this movie is going to be tough we'll do
as much as we can in terms of exposition from other characters but we got some flashbacks we
have no choice and if they were like oh you mean one 10 second flashback that's repeated three times
like no not really that's not what i'm going for it's in slow motion and it's like a half minute
come on j split in it i'm sorry i'm sorry i feel like it was five seconds oh i thought you would
go the other way with that i was like not much happened from grace and it was only apt reminders
of the past that could teach him to understand his mistakes without shutting himself yeah because
luke needed to be reminded of the thing that actually created his journey in the first place
the people he cares about i really hate that idea well because he conveniently forgot them for the
last 30 years now didn't he you forgot layer because you know luke would forget layer
yeah it's not the thing the mood yeah obviously destroy vader or anything yeah just you know
forget that stop it quinton you're making me angry anger is a path to fear which is a path to
territory which is a path to criticism after a youtube channel you're like oh no it was only
apt reminders of the past that could teach him to understand his mistakes without shutting himself
and what's so interesting i haven't thought of i haven't thought about leia in all these years
it's like you know what what why in 30 years would you ever think about your twin sister
for luke it's probably because he's having a wank oh that's why he would definitely be thinking
about her then yeah yeah it makes sense j we'll be thinking about her at that point
have you seen the original trilogy he's definitely thinking about her oh yes
it to be redeemed not from turning evil or destroying something beloved but simply from
failing once it might seem like a big mistake to make from the point because he never failed in
the ot that's a new experience for him he never fucked anything yeah yeah he's never had to be
saved by people no when you have five minutes help me get through this but they actually bring this
up all the time of like luke never failed ever luke was a was a gary stu citation please ain't
no fucking gary stu here we we need the opposite of like we did a counter citation because we'll
bring the citations of failures uh yeah i got i got a whole bucket full like Adam i'd rather
the reverse of well just how does ray fails like she was captured that one time by kylo and you're
like oh yeah she was how did that work again and then she broke out literally two minutes
afterwards and then destroyed the death star planet thing yeah good job you did it oh we have
another picture of uh what jay was talking about apparently it's consistent this one's a shrek
grimace i guess oh my god i think it's probably the same artist oh yes i recognize the technique
yeah they have names that no no they have different names under them one of them's by
uh jennifer h and this one is by jonathan's once by billy this one's by bobby this one's by jackie
what happened how we how do we get to these grimace scene
you found you don't even know where we're gonna go i just don't know how it got here
is this that important quit said that having things that lead to other things just doesn't
fad stuff we don't even fad stuff but simply from failing once it might seem like a bad mistake to
make from the point of view of an audience but to then imagine a lifestyle where simply making one
mistake and giving into fear for a single moment could lead to the death of millions suddenly makes
a life of seclusion seems so much more approachable or where one bad tweet for 10 years ago hang on
so the only reason it led to the deaths of millions is because you didn't finish the job
yeah he's mixed up the timeline there he said your one mistake has led to the death of millions
it's like the death of millions came after he went into seclusion uh that that that blowing up of
five planets that was when luke was already on act two so he was already upset but maybe quinn's
arguing that he saw the future and he was like i caused this by going into seclusion i mean i'm
gonna go to seclusion because i caused this that's just confusing that doesn't make any sense yes
the reality is is that the fact that luke couldn't kill kylo is what's response if you want to put
responsibility on anyone for any one thing that's as much responsible for the deaths of all those
millions as kylo pushing the fucking buttons himself you know metaphorically speaking actually
uh but that's ridiculous luke did nothing to stop the deaths of anybody through these actions
right so i like your idea that it was uh it wasn't because of what he did to kylo it was
like because of some old tweets of his resurface well yeah that's why he went yeah some journalists
some flukes homophobic tweets from like 2013 so yeah luke is uh luke skywalker says no to gay
marriage you just put out a tweet like gays you put out to say like the wife will not stop going
on about how i'm coming home late from work but she still can't make a meal taste good
like oh fluke the fuck he's like i was angry i'm sorry he said too many things about the um
you know explosion marks being a little bit too accurate for sand people
and giving into fear for a single moment could lead to the death of millions suddenly makes a
life of seclusion seems so much more approachable and ray's role is someone who has no possible
understanding of either luke's choice to shut himself off or the ability of any person trying
to be a hero to make disastrous mistakes in their short-sighted attitude and it's her journey in
the film to try and act on the very intuition that luke has rejected and in doing so she makes the
exact same mistakes not motivated at all it looks he looks like beetle juice
he's trying to argue like yeah her naive optimism blah blah blah it's like you do get that she was
like right kylo killed snoke he just had a different like we imply that there's these two
options good or evil kylo's going for this weird middle ground and then he goes for evil
but it like so it allows him to kill snoke but it also doesn't allow him to join ray and be a
goodman even though that wouldn't have made sense anyway like the idea that kylo's motivation is so
powerful and so intrinsic to his family life and his corruption and it's all given up because he
fucking has a crush on ray you know oh that's not very effective it's so juvenile this whole
romance stuff is not to mention confusing most people have a most people who love the movie
would have different takes on why the story is so well written like it's so just like arrival
yeah it's great for reasons that we can't agree on um and i just find it extremely juvenile the
relationship stuff absolutely uh these two should hate each other forever now there should be
nothing that brings them together but they're almost people like ship them which is really
fucked up because he killed her dad aggressively ship them which is insane because okay i can't
say the dad figure thing with ray is not it's dumb because she knew him for 10 minutes uh as in
this is what the films are telling us she sees him as a dad with because he even says it to her
right he looks in her head and says you see han solo as your father but it's like
okay i guess that's just true then like he read it from your head you can't really get more the
more truth than that right but what i what i find odd then is not just her attraction to the guy
who killed her her father but the attraction of him to her that is kind of hot reason other than
force stuff pound me daddy also kill my daddy kill my dad it's it's kill me dad kill my daddy
kill me daddy it's so bad it's it's it's it honestly makes twilight look like a decent romance
i can agree with that uh because people i this is the thing right i'm naive when i saw these movies
the the two in the sequel trilogy i was just like what a terrible relationship these two have
and then some people like it's very romantic i remember major lee told me in rags that he can't
wait to see these two develop into a romantic and we were like what what was that happening
and he's like they touch fingers i want them to kill each other i was like i didn't realize that
was what's happening it's like no that's totally happening it's like apparently according to the
truth it's not happening the murder of one's parents and then comes we're in a romantic
relationship together the fight at the climax of episode nine turns into like uh intense hate fuck
yeah i mean yeah i'm down with it just go with whatever time travel hate fuck let's do it
the the hate fuck causes them to travel in time okay that's ready for the time travel
i started this out by asking a couple questions about like what would be the worst thing you
think they could do well in episode nine what what do you want to think that they're siblings
to draw back to the original series i kind of think one of the worst things what people have
been suggesting the whole ray goes back in time to father to to to parrot her thoughts
she creates etiquette by going back in time so you you think about how what's the best way to
ruin everything you'd be like have first of all have the first half of the film the emperor's back
the death star never actually got destroyed he played a hologram for the rebels to make them
think that it was destroyed and it wasn't like that's this is i want to go really bad okay i'm
going really bad um oh god the ewoks the ewoks got mutated by the holograms destruction into
new warriors dogs that he sends after all of the aligned planets and there's a huge war that they
get to fight them ray realizes that everyone's gonna lose goes back in time and and goes back
in time and kylo jumps into the time portal just before she manages to close it and then those two
when they're really far back in time end up on tattooing fall in love and she creates the terminator
well terminator genesis is pretty much this bad it's kind of what i'm using as my model right now
i'm like how do we fuck everything up terminator genesis did a pretty good job so they undo the
original trilogy like we had this discussion you've had before but like what is worse to
counter what came before or to actively delete it in your canon to say the ot never happened
would that be worse than the i will speak as a trek as a trekky as a well i think that if you
deleted something from canon then you've messed with the stakes where now you know that anything
that can happen can be in a better way erased what would be more offensive to a fact i guess
i'm saying offensive uh to continue with something bad would be more offensive no
i fucking speak volcan that's my point what's more offensive to me i would rather
that they create a whole new star trek series that starts over from scratch from the exact
same place that the original star trek happened and erase it and it's like none of it ever happened
then jj abram's weird mixed universe shit which starts out which is a mixed universe
it is mixed because it isn't it is fucking racist i'm sorry but it's like it's it's like
partially the original star trek universe and then it's it's a combination but i want to see
takasi and and uh or excuse me uh tivul kansa takasi and um romulus get blown up
that was upsetting to me via absolute bullshit retard science that made no sense
i which i hated and made me furious so furious it's one of about three times i've almost wanted
to walk out of a theater was watching the first star trek reboot movie um so i'm really glad about
the reason why i pose this question is because as much as tympani genesis pisses me off because it
deletes tympani at one and two which are amazing movies and i'm like fuck you however is it worse
to do that or to do what they did to luke to take the character to accept the the previous canon
and so then just humiliate them and i'm like oh yeah i i'm siding with just deletion yeah because
you can kind of ignore it it would it might depend on how egregious it actually is it's so
like it's funny that we're discussing this though that's the wildbergs is happening all over the
place and it's just like yeah because the new tympani right is like ha ha we're deleting tympani
at three four and five and it's like yeah yeah sure but i mean like are you gonna be any better
it's like yep you're like well i want it to be good but i also want the biggest the biggest
surprise of the century i also want that if it's bad for tympani at seven to be like we're deleting
tympani at three four five and six i'd be like here we go let's try it again guy and uh yeah
predator kind of didn't do that the new predator was like avp still exist they still happened and
i was like wow you still want them in canon okay fine i'm not sure what i would do personally as a
writer i probably advocate for the whole let me delete the path the terrible ones the problem is
that everyone has a different idea on what the terrible ones are a lot of people say avp one
is good and avp two is bad a lot of people say both are bad i think there's probably one guy i
haven't seen avp two oh it's it's so it's like it it's like you know the first one is bad but
really fun the second one is just bad the only thing i like about the second one is the gore
the gore is cool wow do you remember how dark it is it's such a dark film you can't see what's
going on it's the episode three of season a of game of thrones of avp movies there you go that's
how specific i'm getting it's just so fucking boring but nothing i just remember watching it
like is something going to happen um yeah it's just a giant set piece it's like aliens and
predators are in a suburb be in place that everyone's gonna die here you go what if an
alien fucked a predator well that's the movie you really need well that's the premise of the
film that's what happens and then neither of their two cultures would allow their love to blossom and
be like romeo and jimmy yet but it's an avp porno no it's it's like there's a there's a predator
alien that is red alien jay a wow are you it are you implying that the alien whore isn't already
fucked to shit anyway i'm so happy i'm out of this loop because this sounds awful dude this is okay
jay honestly because you've you've seen it the scene where the pred alien latches onto a woman's
face and starts pumping eggs through her throat was that not pretty creepy as fuck i don't remember
that and that sounds like it you happen to look that sounds really hot it's you have to take a
look around the theater to see if anybody was you know pleasuring themselves oh i was i was just at
home yeah i sort of but what i will say is that i watched grandma looked looked around the living
room to make sure the gore element you never know the fact that they were willing to be they were
allowed to be r-rated was neat and that one visual made me go like oh that's gross and that's it
rest the phone sucks yeah yeah it's a horror movie you want like gross stuff in it i guess
like to i'm just saying but before we say it's 100 terrible there is there is 0.368
uh sorry quinton yeah but what percentage of the population is horror
oh i've i've lost the watch together makes the jay you're the worst i don't know let me find it
we we were trying to fire this guy it turns out he's our manager i forgot that um i forgot that
i was in a watch together um wait and wait people are gonna be commenting on how like which which
where is the link i can't find it oh my god your mother is the link i guess i'll have to
repost the link to our manager just putting it out out there oh thank you very much well i'm
the manager so this shouldn't be too hard for you right you know that makes no sense you should be
the one who's knowing all knowing about these things i just tell you what to do and then you
do it all right i'm gonna i'm gonna draw him back remember when i was like making for intuition
that luke is rejected and in doing so she makes the exact even further than he was before
morally ambiguous do you remember his first scene
what does he i'm sorry what does kylo do that's good
nothing yeah he's morally ambiguous but it's like literally he doesn't kill ham solo instantly
that could be considered nice all the innocent villages oh yeah he sucked he sucks at killing
ray that makes him morally ambiguous he fell in love with ray that makes him altruistic
yeah he's not exactly chaotic like you know neutral or anything well i guess pretty much
straight up evil someone could argue he could be more evil but that's okay but that's okay
that's actually being straight up evil now is morally ambiguous in in standard efap style i
now want to go on another tangent of conversation the idea that kylo is this person that we're
constantly working to see a route for um redemption when he's only ever been an evil asshole and he's
got no history outside yeah what has he done that's good he was a student that's not neutral
or anything right he was i guess that's neutral well i guess that's true his uncle did tried to
murder him well but okay wait so when we're told that vader was this jedi master who was like
respected and he was a good person by obi-wan it makes you think like oh man so he was he was one
and now he's zero can you get back to one kylo is just like he was this child who grew up negative 86
yeah he grew up being this awkward neutral student person who eventually chose to be evil
and you're like can he be good mid is more people can he be good fucking like the only person that
should have this perspective is the one person who really doesn't which is luke like for some
reason ray has this perspective which is the one person who shouldn't it's like everything's
backwards god do you think they're gonna redeem him at the end i want to say yes but the trailer
showing him fighting ray makes me wonder maybe that's like do you reckon that's like a third
field movie or halfway through and that we've got so much more to reveal or do you reckon that's the
finale uh i doubt it's how it begins what if it's like a cold open of like death star
whole audience is just like that could be like that could be the beginning like the
opening quest is i'm going to find palpatine and then like opening quest is is the opening
quest yes i'm fighting from him to our new video game her opening quest is to find all the people
who are so fucking adamant that consistency doesn't matter i want to make films like that
now it just opens with ray saying i knew i'd find you here and then kylo they fight she kills him
in this epic super move and then han solo says you killed my son and starts shooting at her and
she blocks the blast and then luke takes a shot for her and he says you've got to kill him and so
she kills han chops his head off but then chewy gets all mad and shoots her in the back with an
explosive and her parts fly everywhere and one of them turns into a death star i'm just like how much
of this has to make sense it has to not make sense before you're questioning that with the
sequel trilogy is that chewy did something chewy wouldn't have done anything that makes no sense
i'm sorry i just like i i always wonder what the limits are you know because we we constantly talk
about what but doesn't make sense and i'm just like what for you doesn't make sense quinton
what what does it take for a character what and i say quinton this is addressing a lot of the
people we've covered on efap what does it take for you to finally go okay that's weird like that
took me out that was weird and then complete silence i think we're all absorbing the idea
yeah no i mean it's tough it's tough we don't even have a 10 foot tall list that that eats
coconuts that's a better world than what we have coconuts seem like a terrible food to have you
know as your selection if you could only eat one one thing coconuts would suck because they're like
they don't taste good first off but they're encased in this hard they taste they taste fun
but you know like that they don't eat popcorn you don't eat popcorn and you get those little kernels
stuck in your teeth that's exactly what you get it's that same like because of the graininess
no no but the graininess of coconut when you eat it like from the the the pulp of it it it has this
weird graininess it also like gets stuck in your throat for like days after you eat it so it'd be
terrible to have nothing to eat but coconut for forever if you if you're an animal that evolved
to eat coconut i'm yeah but i'm saying there's a human who evolved to be human i can't change
why would you evolve to only eat coconuts you're a coconut you live in the island of coconate
all the way up in the tree and they're super difficult i'm maybe there's some
thing that could have happened but man someone got the short end of the stick on evolution
if the only food that you could eat is coconut am i right it's relative maybe we got the short
end of the stick when you compare to like all the other things in the universe maybe they've got
it easy compared to us why because i could eat everything nah everything you can't eat
everything try to eat a glass bottle try to eat a rock like battery acid try to eat some battery
acid or acorns but you know i can eat a battery acid is just a matter of confidence you could do
it battery acid is just a whipped grape but it's just cocktail battery acid and milk with some vodka
i mean sans like what would you call that what would you call that cocktail battery acid milk
and vodka that's the um that'd be the that'd be the russian mechanic yeah the russian it's
gonna be like the um uh turnoble something um surprise turnoble surprise the turnoble diarrhea
yeah throw a tide pod in there
of course you could at that point you could just call it you know oh my god so like you know when
you make cocktails like if you're doing like a um uh and you want to put a lemon on the side
you cut it down the middle you take a tide pod and you cut it right down the center in the two
sections and you put that right on the rim of the glass what if you you just released that drink
it is cold Chernobyl but they blast it with a set of radiation before giving it to you
like this actually has radiation like yep
you're allowed that's what's gonna happen you know it'll affect you
dramatically but it's good to be fair you could make you could serve it in a bar
and the bar could be called the geiger counter hey i like this there we go you get the whole
thing all worked out like our patrons don't live long but hey they enjoy the lifetime experience
they enjoy the references all right sorry quinton what were you saying about how wrong you are
turning him from a morally ambiguous pawn into the ruler of the strongest legion in the entire
galaxy much like po on the other side of the movie she comes to understand that her own
foolhardy passion has only led to more potential death and destruction it's not even true they
thanks to her choices they've knocked out snoke who was much more evil than kylo
kylo's confused at best so snoke was like sure that we have to destroy all of the good people
in the world that was like his goal kylo's like uh we should what does he say he wants to like kill
everyone the past his offer to ray was to like get rid of the good and the evil
what's your interpretation folks what was kylo's plan with ray
he was offering her because it wasn't to be evil who has any god damn idea because it makes no sense
let's run with a simulation she says yes takes your hand and they go up to like the control room
and he's like okay um like honestly what happens next i'm confused my simulation's already run out
of material anyone i i don't i honestly don't know what was going on because i couldn't tell
at first if it was did he want to join up with her or did he want to destroy her
of viewing her as a rival it's never been clear to this point exactly or some kind of he was anti
first order and anti-resistance he said like let's make something new and i'm like okay how
does that look what does that what does that mean what do you do all right because there's nothing
else i i honestly i don't think there's enough character given okay so mary sue has no fucking
personality and kylo's personality is all over the board and completely inconsistent so how can any
of us be expected to understand what any of this is supposed to mean because it hasn't meant anything
thus far and it doesn't appear to mean anything going forward imagine you said like we're gonna
get on a transport we're gonna leave me and you ray and we're gonna have all of the ships of the
first order just crash land into that base everyone dies and we're gonna move on like
all right i mean hang on that is consistent with ray's character she's basically up until
now just kind of gone along with anything else that's happened around her you just need someone
to tell her what's good and she'll do it like ray it would be good for you to kill these children
she's like with it yes he's like okay slash slash even younglings yes especially younglings
they're gonna turn into hitlers all of them oh fuck anyway but then that's it it's it's it's just
none of it makes any sense but hey go along with it because this is the product it's supposed to
consume this is what i mean about like it makes kylo the most interesting character because people
have no idea what he wants what he's gonna do like that's why he's so interesting everyone else is
just a block of wood but hey at least he we don't he's unpredictable like who knows what he'll do
that even though he's like he seems to be the leader of the first order of the next one so
that's fun that's the one place we did not expect him to go you know suddenly his goal of killing
his father seems too obvious his hatred of luke has been propelling him into becoming
ultimately powerful i'm sorry that doesn't make sense just you hate luke that doesn't mean you
start killing people i understand yeah it's more no that's moral ambiguity pretty generous
is it evil to massacre a village because your uncle tried to kill you that one time
this is this has always been i don't know was he white i don't see the problem like would it be
emotionally damaging to have your uncle try and kill you while you were sleeping yes does it mean
you should start killing innocent students in a building and then taking over the world when i
was sleeping and you're like i don't know were they white were they white nails
i just don't see how it's a through line it's like of course he would kill a bunch of people
after luke try to kill him you're like that doesn't someone tries to kill me i don't immediately
start trying to kill people and actually kill people he killed all the students with his stupid
knights of red most of them i mean all of them right did they say anything about any of them
escaping isn't it weren't the knights of ren some of them as well i don't know were they who are the
knights of ren actually that's a good question who the fuck are the knights of ren as ryan johnson
said there was no time for the knights of ren in episode eight even though there was time for
canto bite canto bite what if the what if the knights of ren were who were the antagonists
what if the knights of ren is snoke they're all parts they're all what i think what if the knights
of ren are morally ambiguous what if the knights of ren is more ambiguity everything must be black
and white village you racist what if the knights of ren are yoda leah and han what if the knights
of ren are actually just like a time period what oh the knights of a concept oh it's it's just a
concept it's like it's like halloween it's like halloween knights of ren and ren is like a
space muslim holy moly the arabian knights thing it's it's it's you know how many knights of
whatever um yeah 101 knights of ren ox is like we found the the rebels we have to go destroy them
and then and kyle's like we'll send the knights of ren he like grabs his shoulder he's like the
knights of ren aren't real they're just an idea kylo he's like what what do you read i'm pretty sure
the real is like no they can't i'll read you the knights of ren all right everything you attribute
to the knights of ren was just you you just invented them we went along with it because you
threatened to kill us the shire herb has addled your mind i want to bring that video out so much
oh my god please tomorrow i got a this i've got a weird no you don't i have good we should just
watch it live on one of the ends of the effect it's so good i might get hit by copyrights though
because this youtube acts weird with odd light like live stuff versus uploaded stuff this whole
thing me and rags oh yeah keep yeah for whatever reason youtube's fine with you doing all kinds of
broken-ass shit that you shouldn't be able to do when you do it live i don't know why you know what
to a to a degree to a degree but here's they're much more okay with it me and me and rags and
wolf created a commentary of fellowship the ring it's gonna come out eventually we'll keep
picking it up and it won't disappoint i swear i don't know which is better the fellowship one's
really good the torch one torch would you guys you gotta do it because i'll
definitely check out oh we've done it it's ready to go it's just that uh i'm gonna release i've been
releasing bonus efap content every wednesday okay well then then stop stalling well because i could
sure use that we gotta we gotta we gotta big him up you know we gotta hype it we gotta hype it
okay well i'll type it up i will say this you asked me um it's kind of funny i've asked two
quick questions one i've been drinking a little bit about aussies did you know that rags and i
have known each other for like almost a year i've been playing a pathfinder game like every week
i did not know that i think you mentioned that rags does not talk about you enough rags i i
criticize you for that you're a bad man no no no this this that's not important uh
the other thing that i guess i would like to ask oh shoot
yeah no uh-oh what is happening we can't talk now i mean we're talking about kyle ben
go on what were you saying you're saying something oh um uh no basically just like um
what's been kind of your experience i suppose with a lot of the way that this youtube shit has gone
it in and i'm gonna ask you this in two directions one in terms of doing really
ass long fucking videos and uh two in terms of there just being a total negative um disposition
towards anyone asking questions about the stuff we've been asking questions about here tonight
uh what's my experience with it all it's frustrating i thought that people would be
much more open to it when i started i was like people the biggest problem people will have with
my work is it's long i know that for a fact and then i and i have been learning throughout this
if you go back to the efap where i first say i'm shocked that people are calling me racist for my
black panther review i think it's either rags or wolf where they're both like you're shocked at
this and i was like i didn't i didn't know that that was what's gonna happen it's like you need to
brush up on your youtube welcome to youtube mate um yeah uh i've had the whole like it went in ways
i didn't expect they a lot of people have accused me of making long videos precisely because i want
to avoid criticism like they wouldn't be as long if not for the fact that i use it as a way to defend
myself like if i make my videos long no one can criticize me i get the same well i get the exact
same that's actually why i wanted to ask that question because i have the exact same problem
where people say oh aden makes hour-long videos because then nobody can criticize her
and no the reality is i make hour-long videos so that i'm extremely concise and precise about what
i'm talking about so i find that frustrating we should hang out because people say i'm not
concise and i'm like i don't think you know what that means concise literally is different from
being is different from being um i'm truncating yourself yes uh being concise doesn't necessarily
and ironically right um i'm not gonna i've talked about this before fringy was in the conversation
so you can confirm it with him we had a youtuber who really didn't like me and i invited him to a
conversation that fringy was in and he said to me one of his main issues with me is how long my
videos are and i was like what do you mean he said so you're making this series on tfa you've
already spent nearly five hours and you haven't even gotten to like a third of the film and i'm
like okay and he's like why don't you just say force awakens is bad that's not that's like that's
not helpful is it i didn't know those people existed they do those people exist because as
i said i'll go back to the same thing i'll go with the same thing people are very much
advisors they want to have what happened why quick tell me what to think
it's very difficult to tell people that they have to think more difficult more in depth than
that because requiring them to put in more cognitive effort than they normally would or
would normally expect and for this reason it's going to be difficult for people to understand
not only why you should listen to those kinds of reviews but why you should listen to multiple
reviews i i often don't even watch movies before i make it but i often will listen to like
three or four thirty to forty to fifty plus hour law or minute long um some reviews of movies
before i even decide to watch one just because if i want to get emotionally involved in a movie
it's more investment uh than it is just to listen to something while i'm working does that make sense
yeah one of the things i talked about in my tfa part one right so when people like if the movie
is x long and you've talked about it for x times two then you've you've broken like you you fucked
up because um they could just watch the movie and then i reference how like you know i am your father
how meaningful that is as a statement and how long you can talk about what it all means
throughout the franchise the second you spend more than fucking four seconds you've gone over
your time sorry too long you're fucked up it's like that doesn't seem like a fair rule and then
what you'll have is a concession they'll be like okay no wait you talk about the most meaningful
things in a movie you don't talk about the stuff that doesn't matter and i'm like oh okay so for
how long stuff in a movie that doesn't matter right as if you can separate such things that's
ridiculous and i think that there's something even the most crap and uninteresting things can
always be a vehicle for interesting things like if we just saw um a shot of a rat running across
a street for a minute we could then talk about what it means to have a meaningless shot or what
it means to be good rat that too that's a very that goes on forever there's always conversations
to draw out and so you get these video essays that are like the last jedi what it means to
fail and learn from that the last jedi a character study for kylo ren the last jedi uh the wheel
building breaks the last all these different topics and what i like to think about my videos
is i'm trying to cover most of those all in one in a concise way i work very hard on my scripts
and i still get accused of repeating myself and droning on i'm always like okay i mean i get well
i get that too with my shit so i understand but um i think you have to though be concise and
consistent in order to make clear what your point is and it's always going to be kind of
conflictory because some people will say this is boring we already learned this but for other
people they will say equally i you're talking too fast you're saying too much and i have a hard time
understanding or following so you have to always balance the two things of making sure that people
can understand and also making sure that people aren't bored and that is a little bit of a um
conundrum i suppose the accuracy of it it's like giving someone directions to some place
yes and actually it's it's very funny we call it high low media richness we were talking about this
a little bit earlier about um transforming something that's music into something that's
visual is is a move towards a more high media richness and viron however um low media richness
which is just pure text is really good at describing things in detail but very bad at
describing emotions um it's very bad at nuance whereas high media richness face to face
communication plays things like this are very good at communicating nuance but not good at communicating
specific instructions so these are the differences between um when we read something which gives us
specific instructions and specific information versus when we see something that's giving us
more generalized ideas about things and it's the content i love on youtube versus stuff that glosses
over very quickly a lot of things especially using terms that assume you have the same definition as
the author like if i said we we had this before but if someone describes a game's mechanics as
tactile or game feel as tactile you're sitting there like um i think i know what you're talking
about but are you talking about the same thing that i'm thinking about and yeah because that
literally makes no sense so we have to try and fill it in however we can and two people will do that
in completely different ways and i i don't know i'm a big fan of clarity but that that doesn't
make sense because you fill in the information for themselves as someone in chat said in finna
small you do repeat yourself i was gonna say um when i can point out times i've repeated myself
but it's always with purpose uh i've established this before but when i get to my analysis point
in my reviews they're usually the um the judgment part while the part before it was the evidence
part i do my best to be as entertaining as i can while explaining what happened and later on i'm
like by the way remember that thing i said happened this is bad because of this and sometimes i'll
have already explained it ahead of time as a sort of like uh seed if you will to have your mind
follow along and then flower into the actual like this is really bad sort of thing so um i
would describe that precisely the way that we we conduct a literature review and evidential um
reporting in academia right is that we start out by saying here's evidence here here here here here
here here and so then once you provide the evidence then you can conduct your own analysis
and then based on the analysis then you can help with your own conclusions that's how all
scientific research works but excuse me it requires having the prerequisite work which
means sometimes you're going to have to spend a long time going over stuff that seems obvious
or you know you have to show that first and yeah and there's definitely times where i could look
at my old work and be like man i didn't really need to say that again or something like that
there's always room for loads of improvement there's no denial of that just that uh there
i mean i've repeated myself on efap i usually preface a lot of what i repeat with i know i've
said this before but it's usually because it's relevant again i'm like i want to say it again
because we've we've found another example of where it uh has become relevant um thank you quinton
for providing us the vehicle in which to talk about critical analysis you uh you're a great
youtuber that's that's our conclusion of this hell yeah yeah see i know you're great at what you do
we knew the end of it actually this is very exciting into becoming ultimately powerful and
his love for figures like his father has been holding him back from what he sees as his own
destiny and his ability to feel compassion for why is he showing this screenshot of what looks
to be almost fan art instead of the clip from the film he doesn't want out on dvd when he's using
he's using clips from the film though isn't he yeah is it all trailer footage yeah but maybe
they were just maybe it was like clips that have been released oh you're right you're right if it's
february then the film wouldn't have been out yet you're right thank you my conscience that wasn't
jay or anything i stopped you from being straw man quinton thank me no we just asked devroll
well yeah i was gonna say doesn't i guess he didn't have to go with this i don't have
too much of a problem with going this visual considering he's got no access to trailer
footage uh uh real real footage that's interesting well he didn't have to show them both in a
genuine legitimate real 100 scientific photographic footage authentic both that
that's an oh they don't use that one enough jay you gotta tell them about that one
get all the video essays don't give them more words
in his past yet a potential one in his future it is this that leads the two of them to work
together to kill snoke in his guards kylo so that he can secure his legacy and ray so that she can
protect her friends secure his legacy let's look at that let's just look at that clip of them
practicing a choreography where three guys all just like go for her block his past yet father
seems to all this they've all got weapons on her and they're all just like i'm gonna hit her where
she's like say hey you say this as if there isn't a myriad of issues with that fight scene love for
figures like this is the thing me and rags are talking about how if you slow down john wick in
john wick two certainly and three there are things where you go oh that's dumb oh that's dumb tlj
there isn't a frame where something stupid isn't happening in in that fight anyway
and yeah i agree with you though the three people going for the exact same kill spot is weird
has been holding him back from what he sees as his own destiny and his ability to feel compassion
for ray comes only from her having no active role in his past yet a potential one in his future
it is this that leads the two of them to work together to kill snoke in his guards
kylo so that he can secure his legacy and ray so that she can protect there you go look at that
she's already holding it up she's already holding it up and they're all like i'm gonna hit that sword
looks really excited that's one way she looks like bewildered remember jay i want to remind
you more of this film do you remember when she's super happy that one blast from the millennium
falcon kills three tie fighters do you remember that i don't think anyone's ever referenced that
scene since the film came out jay i hate that bit that bit frustrates me do you understand me
i don't care about that bit i need you to understand no the reason that bit doesn't
bother me is because that doesn't show her as immensely skilled that shows her as immense
because there's no matter how skilled you are you cannot do that on purpose
like you just you just have to get lucky for that to happen so if you have the tie fight to people
like this ray person she's down on her luck let's do it guys hit eject just before she fires
let's light this up let's give her a good day just you can't just like it's like a happy birthday
thing you know happy birthday that's the reason that it doesn't bother me it's not saying she's
amazingly perfectly skilled it's saying she got kind of lucky i guess is it really lucky yeah
okay i still don't like that bit though jay i hate it just a little bit yeah it's stupid
jay help like like tit tit tit tiny when you keep saying tit
i don't know what you're talking about yeah jay you see tits and everything i'm not i don't
understand what you what you're referring to i mean this sounds a little bit sexist to me right
now i'm feeling a little bit uncomfortable i have to say i want to congratulate efap for
hiring a female that was very um that was very progressive thank you i'm sorry i'm sorry to say
you're not our first for male we had a for male on before um people are asking for um for an efap
where we say you do you know about major lee at all aden about who major lee he's someone we
covered in efap 10 i think no efap 14 i never remember i may have i've listened to a whole
bunch usually no offense guys but the podcasts are usually like five to six to seven hours long
what do you mean they put them on while they go to sleep what do you mean we make the shortest
podcasts the most concise of podcasts i i i i make hour i make hour-long documentaries every other
week i don't know what you're talking about i'm not one to to complain my point though is that i often
fall asleep about halfway through or a quarter of the way through i do not blame anyone for that
what i will say is the major lee's counter argument to the presence of holdo
was that you get to look at women now um i think you get to look at all that if we you're telling
me if we get that star wars guild to guest soon enough which will happen and then we have um you
get to look at women efap we'll have you gay longbone and that star wars guild all guests together
that would and quite frankly mauler i would love to for having females on your podcast
thank you for allowing the lower sex uh you know to to we're working on taking the vote away because
as you will agree our inherent failures as as a species but uh you know we try our best
you unstable and i said ladies night we'll have to call it you get to look at women
like it's too good me and rag you don't get to look at women you do you get the little icons
little icons you can look at them like j people look at you and assume it's a woman it's it's
actually quite funny to me because i have been for years now called upon as a woman to give my
opinion on star wars shit when again i'm a trekkie it's like why are you asking me you're
even more nerdy than they realize because star trek is much more like of a what you could call
philosophical sci-fi than i've studied i've studied star wars from a philosophy perspective
in terms of the joseph campbell stuff which is interesting but i i don't speak any star wars
languages i don't know if there are i don't know if there are a kashik that is i'm speaking wookiee
there you go oh wait wait wait did you say um at ten agra did rags did you do that
yeah darmak and gelada at ten agra chaco when the walls fell damo enchiladas when the wall
is there a google translate for klingon
oh what do you want what do you want to say in klingon no i'll i'll let me find it and then i'll say
something to you capua capua capua do you speak do you speak vulcan and klingon no only vulcan
you speak vulcan no ma thrall i don't know you could be making that up yes friend again all words
are made up so they are made up but isn't every language made up well there's a different process
to making up like a constructed language to a naturally foaming language um i like vulcan is
vulcan's very interesting right because in the first star trek movie um they had the characters
or the actors speak their lines in english and they dubbed them over in the fake vulcan language
so for example i would like you to if anyone knows how to spread their fingers to do the vulcan salute
uh the the um what you think we're retarded wait can't everyone do that no not everyone can
not everyone can but okay so here's here's a really fun thing look at the way that your mouth
moves hang on it's really cool watch the way and feel the way that your mouth moves when you say
these two things live long and prosper that's the way that it is obviously in english the way that
it was dubbed over so here's how you say live long and prosper in vulcan live long and prosper
oh that's cool isn't it neat i like it i approve all right let me try and read this out uh and it's
funny if you try and translate english words into into klingon that don't exist then they just come
out as english words so i'm not gonna be able to pronounce this it's confusing language rules
diversity hem cak mek lul ge mech je kiya sexist
the klingons don't have a word for sex that's what came out
i don't believe that klingons don't have a word for sexist i can believe it yeah i love the idea
that you explain the concept they'd be like why this makes no sense i do not understand
that's not klingon you can't say okay here's something here's a good one for that which is that
um uh okay so do you know how the russians like to to squat because it's the best way to
swap squat yeah that's the squat so here's how you know that there's between a true
eastern european and a western spy which is that it's heels high so if you're squatting
down and your heels are high western spy heels flat
sucka bleat heels flat sucka bleat yes
heels flat
you learn well yeah if um i'm sure that i'm sure that's applicable knowledge that i'll be able to
put a good use how is it how tough was it to learn klingon exactly it's true i wouldn't
know i don't know klingon oh but you know some stuff i guess um i i was working on the vulkan
language project from oh sorry i'm retarded i meant vulkan oh no it's fine don't worry it's
stupid you just think all aliens are the same oh wow actually oh can i get offended do it can
i claim uh well no because you're you're culturally appropriating the vulkan language so no you can't
oh no shoot um no but basically uh there were a bunch of us who were working on the vulkan
language project in the early to mid 2000s and i was working on it along with them
it's just old school shit who cares anymore the whole thing's been rewritten when i was
digging into star trek so sorry when i was digging into star trek is when
star trek was a dead franchise essentially so
carry on i just want to make people aware that we've had someone submit a drawing of the two
grimaces how wonderful is that somebody drew this that's the result of jake's search for
although looking better not terrible the two grimaces oh my god that was that search that
was the uh the search for what gook meant i did i'm mixing them up jay let me be insane
we just i still don't know i still don't know what that actually means by the way
neither do i i'm just happy it led to this they're adorable look at them he's got like
a potato or a rock i don't know i don't care that's a coconut you fuck dad i've had a bit to
drink i will be honest it does look like a chocolate chip cookie it's a potato coconut
i don't know how you i don't know how you could survive after this point without a little bit of
alcohol in the system exactly you know i've got you guys i'll share some some memories with you
oh beautiful don't fire me i quint quint i think i think this is me
quint sounds like a middle-aged middle-aged swear word romantically apocalyptic what is this from
it's you haven't seen um what's it called apocalyptic going with the blast wave
um is that what it's called romantically
it looks like a doctor who costume that that that comic
the comic series yeah yeah the comic series are mentally apocalyptic we've never seen that
i have not oh it's fantastic
it's it's a really really witty uh web comic series that's been going on for like
15 years i like shad memes so like popular
that's the absorber laugh i know what that is you know what george that's a doctor who costume
you know what i'm going to put on screen for everybody so the people in chat already know
about this i know about this because for some reason do you guys ever have memories from when
you were younger you do not know why you remember them like they just do and i'm gonna go on to
explain in a classroom when i was like well hang on you can hang on so like the one i'm gonna
explain i know this by memory for no reason the absorber off was a really awful episode of that
season of doctor who people don't like it's it's a creature that like absorbs people into himself
and he looks really stupid he was played by peter k he was a median it was just a mess and um the
absorber off was created by like a fan they sent like a drawing in of this creature that that
absorbs people and stuff and i saw this on like a bbc after the doctor who episode thing
i don't know why i haven't forgotten it it's just in my head it won't go away
everyone remembers that like but why i've never met a single person who knows the episode and
like was watching all of them at the time who'd forgotten about that why i don't know i guess
it's just memorable hang on let's see if we can find the uh the contest
it's not even like conceptually like a creature that could absorb flesh and grow from it or
something it could be cool but they thought episode do you remember how that episode ends
a boyfriend is like in a piece of concrete and she's just happy with him it's so bad
like rags aden wait aden you've seen did you say you're a fan of dr who am i making that up
oh yeah i love dr who so you remember this episode right oh yes you remember the android
uh yep someone one of you guys explained it to rags i want i want rags to know about it okay
um so the whole plot of this episode centers around like uh
a couple who are romantically interested in each other but not together right
um and um towards the end of the episode this alien creature um feeds this one here
the woman and the yeah this one like eats the woman so and to eat someone he like touches them
and like absorbs their essence into him and actually in that picture she is the one in
the middle of his chest that's with her glasses still on right uh sense she's been absorbed into
his body and she's still she's still alive she's still conscious there but she's just now a face
in his chest but there's a whole bunch of them that are all conscience conscious or semi-conscious
one of them's on his ass yeah um so um the uh the absorber off gets killed um at the end of the
episode um and like dissolves that's how he dies and he dissolves onto like i want to make you
better mention the detail that it's the sonic screwdriver pointed at the concrete that allows
what happens to happen like he just does i've forgotten about that so um so uh he dies on like
a slab of concrete right he dissolves into it um and the the guy who was like and like really
sad because his uh his girlfriend is just like dissolved with the absorber off i would be upset
too the doctor who's the doctor who's there the doctor is there and he's like oh don't worry so
he he takes out his um his screwdriver sonic screwdriver sonic screwdriver sonic screwdriver
he buzzes it at the uh the the like the area of the floor where the creature dies and then
he picks like a paving tile off the floor and her face like the girlfriend's face appears in the
paving tile and then he hands like the paving tile to the guy and he's like here you go his
girlfriend and she's calm and she's a paving tile but she can talk she's just a paving tile
hang on get a picture of it for rags you gotta see it he's happy he's like oh this is great i
got my girlfriend back she's just a tile of paving it's so bad he's just a tile of paving oh jeez
here it is i apologize for reminding everybody of this oh my god it's actually oh my god oh my
it's actually i remember as a kid being like this is horrible imagine being here you're stuck imagine
having an itchy nose oh yeah she has her glasses at least yeah at least she was frozen with her
glasses on i guess oh hang on is that that's moaning myrtle yes same actress as the one in
harry pooper i hope she likes oral i guess yeah oh and by the way um this whole creature this
whole episode was based on like a child's competition to design an enemy i like uh i think
i found the drawing but actually jana and aden this applies to all three we know this okay we
we we saw this ourselves we're aware of that imagine all the people in chat right now have
never seen this before trying to empathize i've never seen this before this is so doctor who's
good um yes or is this just one of the bad oh my goodness yeah this is yes doctor who is good but
you have to at least he's not fucking naked you have to filter it you have to get like a list of
good ones yes because it's not all good all the time a friend of mine watched a bit of it didn't
like it and i was like okay if you're not willing to watch all of it let's just watch a couple of
good episodes i showed him waters of mars and ironically his end once we finished the episode
he was like why couldn't it all be like this and i was like because isn't that the saddest
different rises and like everything right can it all be good yeah um yeah that's because
doctor who is something to be watched in uh what do you want to watch of it yeah i would say
i think i'm sure there's plenty of good ones you're an upset i mean it's funny enough i do
the same with buffy right i skip episodes because some of them oh yes that's exactly how i watch
buffy but if you're like if you're if you're a super fan i can totally just be like i'll watch
the bad ones because there's like small nuggets of good in the bad ones but yeah doctor who is not
i love buffy and i love uh doctor who but i have the exact same way of watching both of them
which is that it's it's good that you're gonna skip a couple here not like i argue regularly
the buffy's great on this show what no buffy's amazing buffy's really great we should watch
no all right wait what let me let me let me test your new knowledge what's uh what's your favorite
episode well my favorite episode is without fucking god damn question the musical episodes
i knew you'd say once more with feeling once more it's a correct decision i'm proud of you
it is the correct episode because it's so amazing on every level it's and and also tabula rasa which
is like the next episode after it is also a great episode randy jiles nothing funnier than that
shit yes oh oh my god randy jile okay well i oh no don't get me into talking about buffy because
i'll get off on a ramp i feel like we can't because not only a j and rax completely unaware
of what we're talking about but most of chat isn't as well i'm sorry okay there's no one i get to talk
about buffy with i actually recently finished it all with wolf and wolf has now entered the world
of no one cares about buffy and he's sad he's like why does no one know about buffy but in the comic
books zander becomes literally fucking um zander ends up becoming nick fury in the comics you know
that right um i've avoided the comics because of a lot of things that that's good because they're
terrible yeah but oh my god yes yes yes uh zander becomes amazing in the comics the stuff that
happens with willow is sometimes really fucking cool but i i am a gigantic oh you know last thing
before we move on because i know people are going to get upset who's your favorite character from
buffy and angel all put together zander wow that's a fair choice uh i i'm gonna i'll have a split
choice i'm gonna say it's a really split split split zander's my immediate choice
and then cordelia yeah oh even with season four of angel i ignore angel oh you gotta ignore angel
are you kidding me okay cordy justin buffy okay cordy and buffy zander and buffy if i have to pick
a character over all outside of cordy that i would say zander and then willow yeah my favorite
characters are wesley and willow and then wesley willow and spike i can't get over how amazing
i should stop talking about this back to the awful doctor who episode that is the absorber laugh one
did you know that doctor who had dickhead monsters they're sort of penisy yeah i was gonna say yeah
yeah i can see it okay for a second there i mean i was like i've stared down a few penises in my day
and that they're pretty uh pretty penisy i'm guessing that's old doctor who rather than new
one yes did they know were they aware did they have penises back i like to think i like to think
they did have penises back then well um yeah yeah anyway there was some old means lots of
things we'd like to think about but does it make it right to finish this video no we're still we're
gonna come back to it just got a couple more memes okay why did you make this guy cry i like this
this one is the the 3d guy again i guess it's like a rendition of me having
organized some form of a debate and i just sit i don't know it's a good 3d meme are they all spiders
uh oh of course it's the spider fight that jay wanted me to set up oh yeah they have hammers and
swords i'm pretty sure the sword people are going to win because those hammers unless they're
magical they look like they've got short range it looks pretty heavy as well if they're all
yoldier the the the habit people will win but well no but they are they worthy oh well obviously
if they're holding them yeah i think we all we only apply in space apparently this
the tail fucking makes that
yeah this this meme is just relying on the idea that ray is gonna uh become
this is the red light media theory right if ray grew purple um fur all over herself and became
grimace super saiyan to be fair i would um be really pleased like you did it jay jay you won
me back i honestly would argue that uh if if they if they like own being stupid and ridiculous
i would enjoy it so much more well yeah i kind of think what other options do they have at this
point okay try to make it good to be serious oh they can't do that it's already awful what
are you gonna do oh jay you and your you and your thoughts you would i'm saying that's what
they're gonna try to do well they whatever they do that's like no matter what it is they'll think
it's terrible no matter yeah everyone's gonna hate it no matter what so if i was them here's
what i would do i would make it the most stupid thing i could possibly imagine i would make it the
craziest dumbest most nonsensical crap that i could possibly make up in my stupid brain
and i would get people to go and i don't know not encourage them to go take illicit drugs but if
they come back to me with interesting ideas and we could all put it in part of it just to it would
be space balls essentially right just do it hate space balls it's awful what no it's exactly
it's terrible there we go perfect wait just i mean it's not you've already you've already
ruined it wait why not just we have to address this just go wait yeah this is like saying oh
yeah my ps3 runs linux oh okay so you you don't you don't think that you don't think that space
balls is funny really i love space balls develop that jay explain to us why you're a horrible
human being jesus christ no i was like this isn't funny i'm not laughing all right love anything
about what do you think about money python and the holy grail oh my god okay all right all right
you're right you're you can stick around for now but i've got my eye on you
jay how could you do this to us that's kind of you don't find space balls funny okay but you
by the time i saw space balls all of the jokes in it i saw were like overplayed
all of those jokes have been done to death don't you realize that's your fault they're
combing the desert jay they're combing the desert fucking gold do you really think he
knows what that means rags he saw he saw the film
how could you not laugh without jay like really
combing the desert they ain't found the shit jay they ain't found the shit
come on my dude you laughing at it it's funnier than the actual joke and i have a giant comb
it's my dude come on we have the Chernobyl cocktail as well by the way
i like to believe it's radiated it's your noble backery that's
what can you guys entertain yourselves i need to go to toilet for once in my life
oh we'll we'll find we'll find a way oh wow wait maller's taking a a urination break i've

they stopped him from giving them money he suggested some people fall off some roofs
let's just put it that way oh oh okay well several times a lot of the time i don't know if
youtube has stopped him but then it would be it would be weird for youtube to stop him super
chat but allow him to talk you'd think they'd just pull out banned but i don't know

we're trying to keep our parks beautiful i need you guys to be aware of this meme it's glorious
bruh i need to see yoda saying bruh
okay here's a question bras used both both as a way to introduce a sentence as a way to enter
to end it so should he say bruh first or bruh at the end yeah you should say both
bruh kill your nephew you must i like i like it beginning that way because i think it should be
like a um you know reflective sort of yoda's so shocked like bruh you should be happy we're
discussing how if um however if yoda used urban speak where he would insert the bruh
i would note however that given that this is fan art and we all know how terrible fan art is
that i expect it to be some impreg shit impreg shit someone make impreg yoda saying bruh
what does impreg mean oh because he's touching oh my well i'm an innocent summer child for something
oh my innocent summer child let me explain oh no it's like vore oh no no it's it's not even as
bad as vore wow it's oh no i don't want to do this can someone else do this it's with it's
it's men who are pregnant oh yeah all right that's kind of all right that's not that's not that
why was he saying that all of a sudden it sounded like you know when else had any idea what i was
talking about no i did it was i'm just as genuine as you are look at this image and tell me it
doesn't have that weird vibe no it totally does it's got the weird vibe sure it's like the vibe of
a picture of like uh shrek pregnant with sonics baby actually i bet that exists let me watch that
movie oh it does it 100 does i'm sorry yeah it wasn't me and fiano we just uh we kind of yeah
it just wasn't working out clearly um how okay i found okay i found this
oh hang on i'm saying okay is this going to be a safe for work or a not safe for work i guess it's
i think it depends where you work
why is it batman jesus sonic
i thought it truly is truly you must be the son of god why bat back
i don't know what it is but batman and shrek being blissfully in love like
it they need to see the story that ends that way they deserve each other
oh my god
what the fuck
what do you what do you think would happen
it's like the tongue on that shirt
there's a little bit of like is this continuity like did this happen
just later just makes it even more fucked up i think that's continuity here
okay here's the reason why it's super awesome right
it's that it's finally every single one of the fourth walls that could possibly exist
i mean the other one is okay but i'm really looking at this more beautiful piece of artwork
up here with batman and shrek and and and fetus sonic this is a real artwork i feel like really
this speaks to me on um uh it just speaks to my maternal tendency yeah i mean i really feel like
you know this this speaks to me in my core and if anyone ever wanted to understand
aiden callan i would just say you know what this image that really makes it make a lot of sense
do you think if quinton was told efap has responded directly to you and he scans through
the episode and clicks here and he's like um i want this to be the first clip to ec
oh i would love for him too because at the end of my video after i was like
it was like a an hour of me just being like citation citation citation citation research
research research research for him to and i said literally quinton try to debunk or try to just
understand any of the theories that i presented in this video i'm whichever like
all right this is called science and research and he's like no get it away
it's like the sub to him he's like like the moon dox meme where it's like reading everything
listen listen every goddamn week i read about five to ten thousand pages of just pure research
and when i see people like this who are just absolute dipshits i mean it's very funny but
it's also sad wait quinton's sad what do you mean he's
i feel bad for him don't you feel bad oh totally when i saw that contra points video i was like
oh i was like this poor person especially with the whole like this group bad but this group
good i'm like oh quinton you just it's the same thing for you like it's just another group
he doesn't understand how look all of us i think let's be honest okay i think everybody here can
acknowledge that we have some social groups that we fall into more in line with than others i
consider myself to be conservative well i'm just saying like this the political way okay uh in terms
of are we talking about like edible animals um wait wait wait wait wait no when i said dog
why did you go into edible animals well because dogs eat things i don't know dogs are edible dogs
you just i had dogs right i mean technically yeah but it's just more didn't you see chicken
afterwards i yes i was uh apply the group of people who enjoy chicken is a label the chicken
lovers i guess so okay so it's rags let's be real you know people eat dogs i don't think he knows
anyone we don't have to be clear about who it is who does it but well i can't say that
um the point is
i bet shrek and batman eat dogs i bet grimace eats dogs he looks like the dog eating
it's the kind of thing you're like how did efap get to grimace it's like you have to watch it i don't
know no no again i've lost my fucking point you're talking about eating dogs he started talking
about eating dogs what did you think would have you know you're talking to
i don't think wait are you saying that only a certain group eats certain types of animals oh
no i didn't even apply that way rags step away i was making sure but you know i didn't say that
at all you're the ones talking about how dogs are edible and i'm like oh why would you go oh no
well i mean they they are in certain they are edible rags yeah i mean you could eat them
kind of culture that would do it more than any other are you
i'd say i'd say that some cultures are clearly better than others
are you talking about vore yeah are you talking about culture is better than others when it comes
to vore anything is edible oh apparently yeah basically yeah edible than others oh
cultures are more easily digested more than others that one makes complete sense never mind
100 on board yeah it's like how it's like how you can digest some languages better yeah yeah
that's what they mean right exactly okay we're all on board with this now i got you
i think cultures that encourage things like violence or
vore like the western culture sure i was gonna say as much as this it pains me to say this would
you like to continue with the quinton video can we vore yeah yes yeah does it i me hungrily or
anything what what dog eater what dog eater no no dog eater he's go side oh fuck you doggy
god hates doggy
it is this how many dogs get eaten in the bible fucking none he'll snoke in his guards kylo so
that he can secure his legacy and ray so that she can protect her friends ray yearns for the past
to know the identity of her parents and wanting to know your parents isn't exactly a yearning for
the past it's almost a yearning for the present in a way yeah also we i thought we established
that she got over that so mas cantina says that you don't need to care about the parents because
you need to look toward the future and she's like okay but then she still cares about it in this
and from what i've heard the rumors are that we're going to get confirmation on who her parents are
in the next film which isn't that the perfect is another perfect trifactor of bullshit like
we've been just waiting we get the answer that question we're like okay now where are we going
and the credits roll and you're like wait no i think people were saying that you said her name
is mas cantina which it might as well be however it's it's we're talking maz's cantina the one that
looks like the encore what oh fuck who cares she's barely she she was so forced into tlj
yeah it's another character where she really didn't have any of this i remember
was it for diversity though or was it just like for toys that's what they said no it was for
it was for both it was yes yes the answer is yes diversity then wouldn't it be a character that
they actually like show on screen so that you can tell that they've got diversity normally that
would be a real actress it'll be a fair point j if not for the fact that they're like look we've
hired a mexican african i believe that is who those are let me i will before i become some kind
of ist let me check lupita neong'o i know her name she's a kenyan mexican actress sorry kenyan
kenyan mexican yep that's that's interesting i'm guessing kenyan parents sex with her is crazy
it's the opens of vortex he's tiny and orange um yeah you know normally i don't make those
arguments it's just that when i saw that clip of of jj being like if i could make it so that like
one of the minions from this what minions from what ignore me no i won't repeat what you said
what did you say i didn't catch that i can't remember it was so long ago
chat the one in chat tell us what he said
what all i heard was minions you talk about willy wonka
you could have fucked it up what do i know i would never
we'll wait in for the for the chat to answer the question escape depression and loop a land
lupa land that's where they're from are they from lupa land is that a thing is that
cannon they're from lupa land it is where the fuck is lupa land yes they used to eat nothing
but crushed up caterpillars what are you talking about what do you say that's the lore from
that's the lore they used to run from the big wild beasts of lupa land and so willy wonka
colonized lupa land and said i'm sorry where is lupa land in reference to earth where is lupa land
well you know what uh big jungles desolate wastes and the most horrid beasts in the world
horn snozzles horn snozzlers sorry snoswaggers oh no um wang doodles
those fetuses that have become self-efficient
it's like it's like if uh erectile this function was renamed it's just right
i have a doc i think i have a problem with uh is that in the movie for some reason i blocked that
out they're from lupa land that sounds so yeah that sounds like rick and morty levels of nonsense
one of the kid's moms uh the tv kid his mom is a geographer she's a geographer in school and she
says well i'm a geographer and i've never heard of such a place and wonka just blows her off
because wonka didn't take no shit from no one wonka doesn't fucking deal with that yeah that makes
sense the island itself isn't documented either not even on a map or computer system and as a result
most people outside of mr wonka's circles dismiss us as nonsense such as for example
miss tavy who was a geography teacher there we go yeah people used to live in tree houses
wait people are saying it's from the tim burton vision
no that's the one that's from the book it's from the fucking book even from the movie
it's a book nobody cares that a movie is a thing that exists
tree houses to escape the monsters where they eat green caterpillars which according to mr wonka
tasted revolting i know the lore learned that the umpa loompas craved coca beans which were
difficult to find in lupa land so he invited them to work and live in his chocolate factory where
they could have all the coca beans they wanted 40 comments don't 40 comments don't know what to say
i never knew about lupa land and i feel like i've been on the lupa listen the lupa lore is
extensive and you know what i doubt it's as extensive as ephab law it's not it pales in
comparison listen i don't i might not know shit about pink floyd but i know fucking everything
about the umpa lupus god damn it lupa land is your fucking speciality you imagine being like
i learned click on it's like i i learned elvish like i learned lupa you can call it a kleon again
oh valkan it doesn't matter the klingon's real too klingon has a language
klingon has a language are you talking about
aidan confirmed does klingon do or not have a language it does do or not
they're all distinct languages yeah rags you racist what they're all just what
very languages languages yeah hang on is different from valkan yeah exactly different from perengue
yeah hang on hang on let me copy and paste one of the comments from this article about
umpa lupus into the chat uh here it here it comes here for when you speak broadly about umpa lupus
here's the here's one of the comments on that article
but wait what oh my goodness i can't even show that i gotta scroll oh i scrolled up i gotta scroll
all the way up first before i could read it properly wait that's an article comment
what it's like take the umpa lupa land law seriously you are reading this all up for nothing
go back no it is too late they're here in the end nigga you thought
so for chat basically it's a series of a's and it just has random messages in between bits
hey rags you know what it said um they are here i was just thinking of the fucking fellowship
of the ring bit where i was reading they are coming they are coming all of the a's are on
a new line and it takes like a significant amount of time to scroll from one end of the
comment to the other yes holy shit there's a there's an entire giant empty comment
i don't know what that means jay is that does that mean the end of the world there's i'm still
scrolling when i said that i started scrolling and i'm still scrolling down this comment and
it's literally got no text in it oh the fancy text it has a slash there's a slash halfway down
who knew that umpa lupa forum discussions were where comment
why don't they take this seriously i'm gay
you thought you would just come here and learn the lupa lore
no no no no you know now as well the uh the epap law is definitely more in depth than the
umpa lupa law yeah they would doubt right lazy part of the epap law yeah basically everything
we have assimilated we have the absorbal off of lore that's how that works absorb
absorbable off absorbable off absorbable lore as jason that's perfect
crinoid so we played like a second of quinton's video when we said we'd go back to it i feel bad
let's really try this time okay it is this that leads the two of them to work together to kill
guards kylo so that he can secure his legacy and ray so that she can protect her friends
i'm sorry her facial reaction when dealing with those three people attacking at the same time
he's like ha ha ha this is what people would do right that's a good point actually does she even
have fucking friends do you remember at the end of tlj where she looks at poe and they smile at
each other and you have this moment of like oh my god they've never met before they've never met
and then we were onto the third movie oh jesus christ you fucked up you fucked when you talk
about passing the torch you need ray fin and poe to be this trio that assault problems together
all with different abilities and different flaws simple two of them hadn't even met until the end
of the third film like oh oh oh poe was supposed to die at the beginning of force awakens wasn't he
yeah and then they awkwardly resurrect him even though i don't know why they would want to kill
him because he was like the only interesting person in force awakens he was the only attractive
one that was awakened that is true i would fuck the shit out of he wasn't even a white male
wasn't even a white man i don't give i don't give a fuck he's got making an exception just for him
yep cock okay right okay we'll see how good of a pilot you really are
look at the way she does that oh the past to know the identity of her parents and to feel
a legacy outside of her own command and kylo instructs her to let go of that attachment
it is only when she is is that even what happens he says let go of the past when she's like you
killed han solo and you're a fucking dick he's like yeah if you just forget imagine if you were
in court i was like you could get someone is like let go of the past let it die like a person i
murdered but don't remember that captain marvel is in court what you'll fight right so this is
something i actually wanted to mention you know the whole forget the past thing there were several
people not limited i mentioned this buggy 298 said it's a very good message the idea of killing the
past and what i remember you'd have to go back to his old tlj review so something along the lines
of like sometimes it's not enough to forget the past sometimes you have to do something more
aggressive or something you have to kill the past you have to get it out of your memory you have to
move on from it aggressively and today people will argue that kill the past was a mistake
not him so like people like i don't know um patrick will do something if he wants to kill
his past they'll say that kylo was wrong and the message was trying to say that killing the past
is bad and that the tlj's message was killing the past is wrong and you shouldn't do it and kylo's
the villain and that he didn't understand the correct pathway which is much more agreeable
than kill the past because kill the past is one of the most bizarre like lessons ever you're like
what do you what do you mean by that do you mean like if you could tell your kids any one lesson
would it be kill the past because the past is honestly the origin of basically all of our
ability to to operate in this world we need the past yeah super useful you're a new person if you
take away their memories if you were never a baby you wouldn't have to do anything
like i think boogie was referencing stuff like literally like process your eyesight
you have that's like what you learn like the first parts of your life doing
your fucking your brain is learning what your fucking eyes do
i um kind of yeah that is kind of true yeah yeah it's brain plasticity it's like
learned for ages about this it's really interesting to give some credit to boogie he
was referring to like say you have a hang up or like a an event that fucks you up in life
kill it has boogie had one of those i i wouldn't know rags it's not like he shares that uh ever
idea that you may have had some past but um say you had some abuse and it was preventing you from
doing x y and z he was like you know you kill that and you can move on in your life sometimes
you have to be more violent than just saying hey you know ignore it and there's something
to discuss there in some way shape or form but my point is that um a lot of people say
that you've missed the point of tlj if you think that the message is kill the past if you're
unaware a lot of people's criticism of the latest stuff with episode nine showcasing the prequels
and the ot they'll say something along the lines of hey i thought you told us to kill the past so
why are you using the past to get us into wanting to see this movie and i'm sitting there thinking
like that'll only work as an argument for the people who believe kill the past was a legitimate
point of of tlj where do you where do you stand on that folks what do you think the film says
in terms of kylo's message i think it says it shrugs its shoulders like oh
i was going for more of a screech oh what does the screech mean
that's the tlj hanging in the snow again on sexual what's the what's the noise you make
when you've just been kicked like really hard in the deck oh in the oh i'd probably be fucking
quiet as the grave while i process what's just happened in the dick though if it was in the
balls i'd be on the floor struggling to realize what's happened but if it's in the dick i'd be
pissed like hey yeah generally if i get hurt really bad i'm i'm i'm pretty silent
unless i don't hurt like a bitch it fucking does i just process it in silence
and hope they go away while you process no i'm just like
like that that's the noise of tlj like it it's like taking a really really really big shit
but if i was if i was honestly trying to take this seriously right so kill the past
being i think there's some validity to the idea that the film says no to that because luke coming
back is obviously a reference to his past in some way the um the ray saying no i will not join you
and obliterate the good side and the bad side at the same time because i believe the good side of
the good side it's like oh she's she's staying with the old not with the new so like i think i'd
be more willing to say that the film fights kylo's perspective on that so that just means that i find
it amusing for the people who took that seriously i guess like buggy 2988 sure anyone else got a
perspective or am i my no i think you're right i think the film definitely owes to it more
especially when you talk about the ray and luke thing and yeah um i guess luke's also
in the same way he's more like let the past die or change it or whatever i suppose you could say
the the idea of learning from failures can conflict with that in some way like po is like
i shouldn't use my old hotshot ways i should move on to discovering better strategies i should
do something that isn't productive yeah well i was gonna say even though that's contradictive
in the film his strategy to destroy the laser is absolutely there's nothing that can supersede that
because everything else dies and yet he's like hey guys we should give up because some of us are
dying it's like isn't that the point that we're gonna die to do this but if we give up then
everyone dies guaranteed i'd love to have like a genuine conversation with someone who believes
that that was the right thing from po like someone who's really open and honest about
the ideas of of that scenario because in terms of information we're provided that that is
absolutely the best thing to do like did anybody here believe that quint not quinton fin was about
to destroy the laser printed i thought that he was going to die to destroy the laser i was sure
of it i believe that and if he was like how would he destroy the laser it was going to obliterate
and melt him i'd be like but it seemed like from what we knew that that would actually do it
hmm what we need just to consider here is that uh the logical cause of the logical
thing that should have happened definitely would have happened in tlj
i want to i'm gonna hot take but tlj is not very good
why do you hate women that's your first reaction like what the hell
okay uh go on quinton bring us home chooses to save the rebellion and by extension ben solos
mother that he decides that ray is no ally and their final squabble over the lightsaber comes
directly from their association of the saber with different ideas for ray this is the lightsaber of
luke skywalker a figure who represents the history of people like her and for kyle i think that's
really i think it's a weapon that they need to kill one another or something yeah you know
giving maximum benefit of the doubt i actually want to say to quinton like your idea is better
than what the film did yeah it's not a terrible idea but i don't think it does i praise no but
but the idea that ray sees it as luke saber while kylo sees it as anakin's it's like oh that's kind
of cool that is really cool yeah they didn't do that in the film though i don't think that's what
they were going for it just happened to be that they were fighting over it yeah i have to like
tell you guys like this is a weapon while they were pulling on it each way i was like i don't
want to walk towards it just walk towards it like they were blown backwards you're like just keep
just okay the figure that kylo most associates with the person that he is to become the lightsaber
splitting at this point which is also really dumb quinton the idea that kylo wants to become darth
vader and i just want that scene where he's worshipping the helmet and then darth vader
well anakin turns up and he's like dude i you this is not like i don't i'm not this isn't me super
cringe bro this is not me and he's like what do you mean you're like well i i kind of did nobody
tell you like i i killed the emperor he's like what i threw him down a hole then kylo was like
he's not dead though and darth vader's like what he's not dead wait no it's like the roles reverse
now wait vader's like whoa whoa whoa stop right there excuse me and then vader vader's like you
should be a good person and kylo's like why he's like what why you worship me surely you disagree
with whatever i said he's like no you could be a trick you're just like some kind of weird illusion
sent by luke no show me your id this is like darth vader with empire on it two valid forms of
identification to confirm you're really a sif do you have two-factor authentication on your mobile
vader's like i do but do you have your sith membership card looks like oh fuck i i heard
that vader's like i i got fucked it's in my other cloak it's it's too dumb to me that vader hasn't
turned up this whole time and apparently i don't know if you guys have heard about this but
aden christiansen is supposed to turn up in episode nine at some point yes he is yeah and
i'm gonna be so pissed when he turns up at a ghost and he's like yo it gives says anything
i'm like where the fuck were you this whole time you piece of shit waiting on the cover of
i'll be honest with you guys because you know some people might be like oh this sounds stupid
how do you write it well it's like yeah maybe force ghosts were invented so that alec guinness
could be an empire strikes back and return to the jedi it's like you get to have alec guinness back
because he's dead but it creates a bit of a problem because do not do all good guys not get
to come back and so how much should they come back what should they say to characters it gets
complicated it's not impossible to make your stories with them though i kind of like the
idea that maybe they turned up to kylo and he misinterpreted their messages or he found them
to be like i don't know fucking annoying or you make you make them if the idea well before this
they it was ambiguous as to whether or not these ghosts actually existed
or whether or not they were just only in the mind of the person who saw them
so yeah if they hadn't done the whole fucking yoda lightning thing then it would have been
very easy for kylo's hatred let's just say to lead him into that to lead him into thinking
that this is what they would have wanted and we just decide that that lightning strike was a
coincidence what that lightning strike was a complete coincidence and completely unrelated
to force ghost yoda that's canon now what i mean it would it would fix that i agree jay it would fix
fixes a couple things it just is insane it's like it's a different kind of insane
it's like oh just just happened just coincidentally at the it you'd think that a lightning strike
would have hit that fucking thing a long time ago if it's been like x amount of years but hey
yeah it's like yeah god didn't send the she bears it was just a fucking coincidence
but sure jay she go on go on jay what else are you gonna say well come on what does that lead
um yoda wasn't even there luke was just losing his fucking mind in fact there was no lightning
strike luke was just you losing his fucking mind the alien tatty milk was hallucinogenic
ray never even visited the plant like when he was when when he was drinking that he thought he was
like he thought it was like a really attractive woman and it wasn't milk he was just like being
handled he was right it wasn't a very attractive woman he thought it was like a he thought that
that creature was just a really attractive having a drink that's so cute that's why that is cute
oh my god saving that right now hang on though you know what you look like oh there it is
pikachu again i do i do appreciate this is great oh my goodness i love that taught png i like the
idea that rags turns up to this one event because he's like you know what you went too far you you
went too far you look like this
you're not going to know what it is but you look like it oh no that's a that's a that's a stupid
universe thing no one likes that you can see the resemblance i don't actually i'm sorry all
right jay i'll give it to you i know i'm sorry that you do see resemblance i'm sorry but the
rags one is way cuter like ten thousand tires also it's more adorable also i won't fucking
try and kill you on the internet if you don't like me so also people want me to aidan are you alive
did we kill you
can we kill hey dad hey dad hey dude hey dude good serves the dog eater right
once this came up she went silent what i want to make you guys aware of this too
i don't know why this exists but this exists as well
oh god oh no
oh
look whether or not aidan is here to to help us through the quinton video we do have to finish it
i'm so sorry so don't judge me when you're like oh my god why do we have to do this like
do it okay we're just talking about lightsabers i think let's do it that kylo most associates
with the person that he is to become the lightsaber splitting at this point could
potentially be seen to represent the point where kylo has gone too far as the divide between so
you don't even know well but that's the thing with tlj you just have to guess you know what
any of it means like oh your last idea was actually kind of good now we're okay that's
actually the problem when kylo goes too far you have um i guess not not the part where he's like
murdering anyone in the pub where he's just like yeah i kind of want to like keep doing what i've
been doing for ages i guess i kind of agree with you but yeah like why would that be him going too
far as opposed to killing i'll be honest with you man like back when i actually enjoyed tfa which
um i guess i can kind of somehow enjoy some of it now still but when i thought it was a really
like strong movie compared to now um i used to think that him killing han was like the definitive
answer like yep he's gone there's no saving kylo ran but then this movie is like no no there is
there is and then it goes now he's gone it's like oh so he's gone now gone now and i would love it if
the next movie ends with his redemption it's gonna be so funny the theory that han pushed uh to
activated the lightsaber himself to protect kylo oh my god no oh why would you say that i hope they
do it they're gonna edit that's so terrible i hope they do it jay what's wrong with you so
han knew that kylo was going to be in danger if he didn't um if he didn't kill him so he pressed
the button himself wow jay they might do it i want you to articulate why you hate that
why i hate han solo killing himself yes let me get where do i start
han solo wouldn't kill himself how's that for a beginning oh i misunderstood you i thought you
meant that force ghost han solo turned the lightsaber that killed snoke to save oh my
goodness i i was thinking about something else that was retarded but different oh my good i
i was drinking you piece of shit i was
that would actually be the ultimate fucking decision for him to make
like he just he's like hey i saw yoda activate lightning i can fucking press a button like i
can press a button like what's stopping me from doing that i just turned the lightsaber fucking
kill snoke that's amazing it's going to be a flashback where ghost han solo was talking to
kylo or something it was like but i saved you like dude have you seen the soul movies last movie have
you seen the soul movies so like soul movies the soul is it's s-a-w no i haven't so the thing
that people made fun of them for was that for every movie they would keep inventing scenes
from the past movies to re-inform events of the new one so say for example guy a kills guy b and
then we find out in movie two guy c told guy a to kill guy b and you're like oh shit film three guy
d told guy c to kill guy b by telling guy a to kill guy b and you're like oh my god and i'm just
picturing this for star wars it's like yoda convinced han solo ghost to turn the lightsaber
kill snoke why though it's like i don't know it just fucking happened the fucking crazy thing is
that that would be a better payoff than what we got well you make more sense i don't know han
actually has like established motivation to kill snoke kylo doesn't this is this is the problem of
establishing force ghost could actually do things it's the way like why isn't han solo a guy who's
very emotionally driven in a lot of scenes just being like uh fucking i'm gonna go kill snoke i'm
gonna i'm gonna levitate a lightsaber over to his fucking skull and activate it it's like yeah do it
he doesn't have a force ghost because he wasn't like a force right right but let's just transpose
that to literally any jedi yeah i feel like at least a jedi probably have done something about
snoke by now um aden are you alive
we're gonna have to check on her every once in a while to make sure she's definitely dead
all right i feel bad i reckon she's asleep at the the desk sort of a little green ring just appeared
on her icon that might be us reflecting it might be reflecting into it i don't know yeah everyone
make loud noise to see if uh wow do you reckon it's it's not us then maybe it's like her breathing i
guess sometimes hits the microphone maybe that confirms she's a live chat that confirms she's
hang on hang on so she's just sitting there listening breathing while like you could be
you're right she's just like she could be sleeping anything she could have fallen asleep
all right it's fine she'll wake up while we're doing super chats it's fine yeah let's let's
let's hear more about how tlj would be better if it's a different film but quinton for some reason
believes it was the film that he got could potentially be seen to represent the point
where kylo has gone too far as the divide between his past and his future has become too great and
the final battle on crate is where all of the paths of these characters interject it's where
i like that he says all the paths interject on crate when it's like super forced that everyone
ends up on crate you remember rags that you have um ray ray fin escaping with rose on the stupid
ship and they end up being the only ship that gets breaks through the defenses of the rebellion
in that thing and they're all shooting them like oh fuck you and it's like oh wait they're good
guys it's like really the only ship that got through your entire fucking cave defense was
the one fucking ship that had all the good people on it good job i guess all right you know nailed it
you know rags all of their paths happened to intersect it's like oh it just just so
hot what a kowinky dink we all just ended up on crate and ray of course the other day we didn't
even know this place fucking existed you just you just picture ray she's in this room she's
just in this big force activity she's like oh out of breath maybe a bit stressed she's like oh
kylo's unconscious on the floor i'm gonna take the pieces of the lightsaber then i'm gonna look
around the room and i find this exit sign and i run to that and there's this room and it says
snokes personal ship and she opens the door and jumps in and then goes to crate you're like
all right there's a lot of things you could have done there but yeah all right fair enough you did
that and that happened to be something you could even do i just the idea imagine she escaped from
kylo as kylo was chasing her down and she got into the shuttle or whatever something frantic
i don't know so much that could have been there instead of just oh great go i guess it fucks me up
but someone says this is all just like where the paths intercede it's like no no no stop it
they're forced they are they are shoved into these positions extremely arbitrary square peg
circle hole shoved that's all it is to sacrifice himself for a rebellion that he once didn't
believe in where rose saves fin out of love and we're polar how can you how can you just
you just say that like it just like we didn't get the seed that we got
cock you're right jay yeah i'm right you can't just you can't just join and say fuck
i didn't say fuck i said cock he said cock isn't that the same thing uh i fuck cock and my cock
fuck cock there's like they're definitely interrelated concepts yeah like my cock fucks
it is where all of the paths of these characters interject it's where fin tries to sacrifice
himself interject doesn't doesn't mean intercept or oh good point let me quickly look up what
interject means because i've always used it to mean something slightly different
yeah this isn't yeah he looks like when he interject is not the correct word to use
you could argue it you could say that they interrupt each other but i wouldn't say that
that matches what happened that is the biggest problem with this video yes everything else he
says is is just tertiary this is the thing this is the one we finally got to guys shouldn't have
said interject fuck you quint it has the word enter in it so it must be right to sacrifice
i've done in fairness i recently learned and the person will know they made a they made a
subreddit post about this and i felt bad because um i don't know i don't know if you guys can share
an experience like this but i'm gonna go ahead and do mine so i've been using and i know this
because i edited the just right debate recently to cut out the pauses it's gonna be going up on
moolah soon enough i use the word stat stative to mean stationary that's not what it means
stative actually means if i let me check pretty sure it means like the opposite of what i was using
it for um but i can uh well so well i can explain i can explain how i know we're getting loads of
f's is the stream down oh no just refresh i gotta explain my thing you can't say that when the
stream is down because they won't see it into spread into is it is it done
is this what is that of no the stream it's that remember i don't have to kill the guest
we've killed guests before we've killed hosts before
i know you said that was a kill guest before
like it's like a reassuring quality of our stream like yeah we've got a body count what
so when you talk about verbs um a stative and versatile verbs oh god that's a that's a deep
meme too yeah um a stative and abstract i think of the two types of verbs one means like
i'm gonna be corrected on this because this this is this explains my poor memory i remember the
meaning one means when you're moving and the other one means when you do it in action that
requires you to stand still or something like that but this is this we're going all the way
back to like high school english education that i fucked up so i looked at it as when abstract
nouns or whatever mean that you're you're doing things that are sort of hard to imagine and
moving around and then stat of ones when you're staying still i thought i interpreted all of it
to mean that stat of means that you're staying still and so i described the planet that hux
could have destroyed at the beginning of episode nine as stative episode eight sorry when what i
mean to say is stationary or even static i didn't actually know this but static means to stay the
same um well now all of your criticisms are invalid for the rest of the uh this is kind
of what i want to encourage um i don't know how you guys will feel about this i imagine you'll
agree but there are wids i don't actually know the definition of they exist and i have to actually
google them and be like oh shit i've learned something today and so now i think i said it
in this stream previously but i use the word static to mean standing still when i almost said
stative uh because of my history but i'm trying to educate myself out of it but i use it um on
just right and luckily for me i think everyone understands in the debate what i'm actually
trying to say um but this is kind of highlighting why definitions are important so if you told me
when you say stative you mean and then you explain something that i don't mean at all and i go oh no
no no no no that's not what i mean at all and then you get to actually be clear on the debate you get
to be clear on definitions and something that bothered me i don't need to name the name of the
podcast but um there was a podcast i was watching that said they hate it when they debate people who
constantly start the debate by saying can we please define our terms they saw it as a waste of time
they saw it as a waste of time in a way to avoid the subject and i was like no no no no how is that
how is that avoiding the subject because if i say the point thing you could possibly do
tell me exactly what you mean their point of view is i need to take a shit you're avoiding
the subject their point of view was that if i say my position was that um tlj stars no people
and then you go what and i go well let's define people let's define people and then i say people
means anybody who has a hat on and you're like what they would see that as you trying to walk
around the obvious point that you're wrong and i would always be like no no no let's hear what
they actually think that means but you're by the way you've defined that term you're correct
you might have a debate about what the word people means but you know you've agreed on
on something or maybe not you know and yeah well i guess it's important to define your terms
my overall point is that um if ever and you won't always know but if ever you think you're using a
word that some people might define differently it totally helps in your video to take that extra
10 seconds to say by this word i mean this yeah it can't hurt yeah some of the chat said go poop j
i'm i'm all right but thanks for your concern but from now on if you ever catch me saying
stative in chat be like hey molly piece of shit you mean static and then i'll be like oh shit
yeah sorry i mean static because i get corrected on a couple of things and i try and take it uh
to to mind but sometimes you know you're so ingrained in something that it takes a while
to sort of change over yes that was my point what were we talking about before that was there
anything can i continue with the video i don't know what what was your worst subject in school i
want to know now worst subject yeah what do you mean by worst as in like the one you performed
welsh really you had to take welsh i despised learning the welsh language i never understood
why i was like why do i have to learn a second language that doesn't amount to anything it's
like because it's your culture and i was like okay how does that help me yeah so yeah but the
welsh haven't amounted anything so told what your culture is like well i'm i don't know how you guys
will feel about this but i would actually advocate for one universal language for the whole world
i mean and if someone says that'll fuck up like of course you do you speak english i'd be like no no
i'm okay with it being literally anything like vulcan even i don't mind no some languages are
shit well i don't know enough about all languages to know which ones are flawed i'm pretty sure people
say english is flawed non-english ones well my point is that i think we have enough trouble
figuring out who's fucking up the english language then we need with extra languages existing for
us to have to translate into english whether or not we even use english properly you know what
i mean let's let's compromise we'll make it compromise we'll make it compromise everyone
learns english there you go and we were pretty much there already right oh yeah that's basically
what the world is like already just go to yeah that's yeah just if everyone learns english
boom like i've been told there's english because that's the reward for fucking ruling the world
but i've been told that if i was to advocate for that i kill culture and i was like but
everyone will understand each other clearer so i'm okay with it so bilinguality is a thing
bilinguality i guess i assume that's a word and if not you know what i mean when i say it that means
it's a word but it's okay to have multiple languages yeah yeah no well some of my closest
friends being swedish uh german i was about to say australian they all speak english so you know
like the the idea that people are learning english is mandarin the most known language
right now or is it english i believe so it's mandarin yeah i think so the problem is that it's
in it's based on population rather than yeah someone said go shit milk go shit milk
milk shitter means gay what why oh oh because um because come out your ass milk shitter
it's obvious it's also makes me uncomfortable yeah it's a disgusting word oh uh dr smash said
what are you talking about more english is already the prime language so what i'm advocating for
literally erasing every other language so everyone only speaks one language and like i said i didn't
specify english i don't have any attachment i do disagree though attachment to english more so than
any other language i'm advocating for a world where we all speak one so that it's much easier
to communicate by and large but also there's no way to enforce this of course it's a complete
pipe dream but um would you app would you advocate for a hive mind well so yeah to clarify so someone
was like wow more or less you want people to literally be told that they cannot learn other
languages i'm like no no no no no i'm saying it's not possible in any peaceful way i just think
that it probably would have ended up being better if we all spoke one language it would be convenient
sure i mean it would certainly be pragmatically convenient sure but i think that's a small
gain for the erasure of that large of a cultural but would it be an erasure of culture if we all
already spoke the same language i mean in an alternate world where we already spoke the same
language yeah don't don't confuse me here i'm not asking for the erasure of actual culture
if we all move to mars and it was populated entirely by americans it probably would be
well essentially english speaking right yeah it'll probably i mean english will be the predominant
language of mars because it would still be other scientific other languages for sure spoken there
maybe even they invent one from for mars itself and call it martian are you are you advocating
for basically like a metric system of language i just think that uh a lot of our problems in
the world come down to communication as gay as that sounds well i think so what have you had
in many senses sure the very basic core of each language was the same but then all of the the
more complicated was you know the all of that was different um so you had basically you could um
have a basic understanding of anyone from anywhere but when you want to talk if i was to explain my
prime motivation it's the absolutely everything everyone gets to get what they want i just wish
everyone understood each other better that's that's it's really really altruistic so you're
advocating for universal translators which actually i'm totally totally but the problem
with those is surely they wouldn't be perfect oh you would oh you wouldn't the perfect world
for you would be telepathy you wouldn't even use you wouldn't even use spoken language
i don't know what would happen to our culture if we had telepathy holy shit
if it was involuntary telepathy that would fuck everything oh yeah
any bad thought you have about any of your friends they would immediately be like what
the fuck dude well i mean i'm not saying just like mind like straight up mind reading but the ability
to focus and basically project your thoughts onto someone based on like proximity surely you'd need
language for that because there would be like yeah you have to like record things and mind you
know it wouldn't just be well no it would be it'd be just just concepts i guess yeah you could just
communicate a concept that you could yeah the problem would be the uh like how do we record
messages how do we distribute them you know stuff like that two two comments from chat two
philosophical not much practicality even real language isn't perfect for communication i agree
with both of those this is why it's a pipe dream it's not going to happen i just think okay define
pipe dream what is it it's a dream in a pipe oh okay a glowing yellow pipe next question
artificial barriers of language um yeah what i what i'm the the hypocritical nature of what
i'm defining is like yeah i wish we could all speak one language to make things easier and it's
like yeah there's so many problems in implementing that and there's problems that come with it that
if we're going to get to the point of wishing for things that aren't even possible then why don't
we just wish that everybody's happy and i'd be like yeah okay i agree with you um the the way
the way i define pipe dream is like something that you want but can't happen i don't think
there's a possibility of this happening that everybody speaks one and you know i wouldn't
want it to happen to a degree like if someone said let's enforce that everyone only speaks one
language i'd be like no no no no no no i don't like that that would be like crazy totalitarian
shit i just think uh if we all spoke english from the get-go that we'd probably be able to just
we'd be focusing on defining the the way that we've sought out the language faster than we are now
because right now we're also dealing with translating everything too um i think i don't
think anyone would disagree with that right like if everything from 10 billion years ago was all
written english too we'd probably be a lot further along people are going to argue that there's less
that there would be um because the way that you the language that you speak actively um influences
the way you think it influences your personal biases your uh mauler have you not seen twitter
people can barely speak english to begin with like yeah it does do you guys um so i did i did
psychology for a while in school it's like my best subject it was really interesting um so there
was do you guys are aware of schema theory i hate asking things like this because like
when it's like a science thing i have that i that just doesn't come up normally i hate asking if
people know about it because it's like i'm worried that if either it'll be like so obvious i'm
worried that like if i don't ask and like i assume everyone knows what it is people think i'm
oh arrogant guy i think assumes everyone knows what it is and if i do ask people you're like yeah
of course we fucking know it wasn't even the question do you ask schema theory are you aware
of it i don't think so i don't think so it is um there was a study i want to say it was
i'd um loft some parma um it was uh i can't remember that it's been ages and studied this
um shows that when you um when you ask people questions um and you change the phrasing of the
question the way and questions about events that have like physically happened right and you change
the wording of the question then memory of the event changes based on how you word the question
it's a really interesting study and like based on like uh different languages uh existing it
going to alter people's perception of the world hugely so for that reason i think like you know
having different languages is people here hugely more very like more varied perceptions of the
world which i think is going to be good because if everyone sees everything the same then
i mean you're not going to have the advantages of different perspectives and different ideas
i mean though what's the whole point of newspeak in 1984
hmm hmm the book um space kitten says everybody i wanted to bait him bilingual minds have better
grasps of social context and thoughts and gives you a bigger perspective of things yeah but in my
world like i said this is totally like i said i keep iterating it's a pipe dream if there was
only ever english then that part is over the part where you have to translate or at least understand
what the language in the context is we're all using the same one even though there would
absolutely be as there is now different groups of people that are using the same language but
words mean different things we're going through this right now like um fanny dare i say dreaded
certain words that to to australian calling australians calling someone a cunt is is almost
like saying hey buddy while in britain that's a little bit harsher but still okay and then
in a lot of different places in the world that's like the worst thing you can say to somebody
and it's how is it that as soon as you said australian i knew you were going to say cunts
because it's like the perfect clear example and a lot of australians are genuinely like
why do people have some problem with cunt it's it's the same in scotland as well i love cunts
it's like it's time of the dim well yeah yeah no um and it is to a degree in britain as well
if someone called me a catholic what if you were walking around in the street uh
someone's like you're a fucking cunt i just don't know anywhere that's like that sounds aggressive
like if someone said hey cunt right hello yeah like that sort of thing i'd be i'd be confused
i i would assume that they were mistaken like it because it's offensive because so i would assume
that randomly off the bat they clearly made a mistake we'll see rags when i send you a message
like hey you ready for eve happy massive you could be like oh or you could be like yeah man i'm ready
uh depending on where you're from in the world i forget even how like massive is supposed to
mean and so i even forgot because the meme the meme has taken over so my recollection of its
original intention is just gone um yeah uh yeah i guess uh my my idea was just that a degree of
misunderstanding is removed i'm not saying all misunderstandings removed by any degree
a bus driver called me a cunt once like as a term of indian it was great it was like it was like i
was fairly new to scotland at the time and i was like holy shit this this place is great a bus
driver just called me a cunt well i i've told this story before but let me ask it now just to see how
it works rags what if tomorrow me jay aden and several other people well just to say everybody
every time you said the word toilet we were all like silent and then why do you know why did you
do that why do you always do that we finally figure out that uh it's a fancy no no no whatever
you have a list of people how can you always start off with you first like me da da da da and
everyone else now it's everyone else and then i the end because i'm really bad with english
i've been advocating for the fact that we all speak the same language so i can learn more about
my own you see it's not it's not always just um i at the end is it not that context it should have
been i but um well it's if you're the only person that you were um did fuck if you're the
only person in the weather so that like fucking like it just came out like like the the fucking
the bubbles came in my nose i was like really stung for a second there and it comes in your
nose uh yes it is the only thing that comes in my nose rags what do you get about what about what
about snot why didn't snot come in your nose somebody comes
carry on jay i forgot what i was saying something about
uh
chat keep asking me to play ocean man what am i supposed to do um i gotta keep talking to make
sure that it doesn't get copyrighted we're gonna play in the background um so funnily enough with
the whole me blah blah blah blah blah and then the difference being person name person name and i
i don't think i was aggressively taught that in my school and that's why i've grown up to not do it
right that's the thing that's the thing um that's the thing i was saying if um you can't tell if
it's supposed to be like me and this person this person or this person this person i just take the
other people out of the sentence and figure out if you would say me or i if you were just talking
about yourself only without the other people there i don't even know is that correct i don't
know yeah that is correct so if you're like i'm going so if it's like um if you're saying uh okay
so uh uh me rags and mauler are going to the store that would be wrong um because yeah that
that's what i'm talking about because you'd say i'm going to the store so it would be mauler rags
and i going to the store um what's an example you're saying you'd still be at the end are you
even if it was like well you will dot dot dot in come to the store with me it would be okay so
it would be so i yeah um but even that wouldn't be a consecutive list of names so i would say come
to the store with me rags and mauler because it without well obviously not at the end because
you're not listing out yourself included in the group of other people
uh yes you can list yourself in a group of people i didn't say you couldn't that wouldn't
be a scenario where you are including yourself in the group of people why not you can we can if
you're saying come to the store with me comma and then you address the other people that's not
the same as i was saying i was saying um if if um come to the store with me rags and like with
me rags and mauler like we three are going to the store already and i'm talking to someone else
yeah but that's rags and mauler that are part of the list not you no yes if i'm also going
because you're not you're not telling no because you're not telling yourself to come with you
no i'm okay right rags i'm talking to a fourth person right um and i say come to the week like
okay even i am bored of this me okay i go for a jab listen okay so um so you me uh mauler going
to the store um and i'm talking to a fourth person saying come to the store with me rags and mauler
would be the correct way to phrase it not who is it rags mauler and i because if you were to take
the other people out of the store out of the store out of the sentence uh you would just say
come to the store with me not come to the store with i so that's how you can tell yeah i know in
that situation that's not the one that i was referring to this is the thing i didn't know i
don't know a lot of rules about english honestly english was my best subject in school it was not
mine i was really good at maths uh i really liked maths up until it got really complicated
i found with math that i could either pick so like second grade yeah man i'm with you second
grade fucking nude i lost it like fucking kindergarten but here once i once i thought
that i was getting the grasp of math boom they start throwing letters in and i'm like what the
fuck just happened and shad felt right at home he was like here we go um yeah i think that if
if none of that already educated that but like like the thing is the problem is like i know that
that's a problem and i still do it and i'm working to try and stop doing it in terms of
like correct english and there's a whole bunch of things i've been learning as you go by
and it's frustrating um also the whole pronunciation argument like different words
that sometimes people will argue like that really what do you pronounce it as pronunciation
pronunciation yeah we say pronunciation isn't it this is i i think that a lesser person would
call that ironic well is it ironic that the word pronunciation is pronounced different ways
i could be wrong i could actually i don't think i don't think that's irony i don't think that's
irony i think they're both acceptable i think oh no i don't think that's irony i don't think
so either fucking i my brain is too exhausted to figure it out but uh my point was going to
be that um it's funny that we're constantly trying to learn how to to be more clear with each other
and correct with how the rules work and stuff and um i don't know i feel like we've nailed it
we've just explained while exhibiting such things would you not agree my panel my wonderful panel
for the night we don't mind panel yet mine punal i feel you know quinton quinton's watching this
right now he's got his beer and he's like yeah absolutely he's totally watching he doesn't drink
that's these guys don't even address the video they're just talking about weird things that
don't make any sense we've had people in chapping like get on with it and i'm like you knew
he's complaining pronunciation and enunciation no that's the thing i can actually see how i
said pronunciation i might have fucked it up because you take pronounce and then add
enunciation and i'm like pronunciation and it's like that's wrong and i could be like oh shit
that might be wrong because i've never heard it pronunciation in my entire life that's why it
stood out to me yeah like i said i could be wrong maybe everybody here gets it wrong in which case
is it wrong at that point that's another interesting thing about language that's what i was trying to
highlight with the toilet i was like if everybody wakes up and tells you rags that toilet is offensive
slash not a word how long does it take before you stop using it not very long right because
it's useless it doesn't help you translate anything to somebody right yeah i mean i'm not gonna i'm
not now i i'm still firm on literal all right well i will never get on litter is that if tomorrow
everyone woke up and told you that murdering innocent people is right you you wouldn't then
agree you'd stop because it's like a principled thing but when it comes to language you'd be like
toilet doesn't mean anything to you guys like when i say i'm going to toilet and we all go
you're like what the fuck are you guys like why are you reacting this way and so you you would
change it because it's not working in terms of translation that's that's kind of what i was
getting at and i know that that would never happen but you get what i mean yeah it would take
i mean for language at my bar for accepting things based on
you know it's it's social um i guess uh prevalence would be far less for language than it would be
for moral absolutely and so if one person says fish means car you'd be like you're insane
ten people still crazy a hundred people you're like that's weird and then a hundred thousand
people you're like how the hell did this happen and then everyone you'd be like wow i guess fish
means car now okay but i thought we had a whole system for that you'd have to ask a whole bunch
of questions but you'd probably be willing to convert over to saying that'd be so weird wouldn't
it having to everyone like if i if i realized that i had been saying it wrong the entire time
and everybody was like oh yeah this is how you're supposed to say it then i'm like yeah that's fine
molly your tangent has nothing to do with the video and that's why people want you to move on
and that it's different again are you new to efap
winter was just a vehicle we have jumped several subjects
i feel like we've done that before rags can you confirm or
once or twice we've had what one might consider to be tangents like distant tangents or however
you would describe it to mean unrelated to the video don't worry we will eventually finish the
video as we always do except for the two times that we haven't and the final battle on crate is
where all of the paths of these characters interject it's where fin tries to sacrifice
himself for a rebellion that he once didn't believe in where rose saves fin out of love
and where po learns to lead the rebellion with strategy and intelligence instead of a steadfast
attitude strategy and intelligence fast attitude isn't steadfast like a good quality that's good
good speaking of what we were talking about steadfast let's look at the definition for that
resolutely resolutely or dutifully firm and unwavering um i guess the negative connotations
that would be stubborn rather than steadfast steadfast is much more of a positive connotation
yeah like my steadfast companion not quite the same as my stubborn
um maybe quinton's trying to make that point i doubt it but maybe he's trying to say that yeah
he made the right decision in his own way uh but there was more information that he could have
dealt from which is but he changes his mind when he hears the plan so true which is something that
a lot of people get stuck on like when i said to just right it's like literally telling him the
plan he was like oh this could work and it's like oh wow look at that he's reasonable
i say reasonable you have to be insane not to agree with their plan their plan was great
we're gonna go to a shrouded planet under um cloaks for our transports and we're gonna have
them destroy our ship and convince them that we're all dead it's like wow that that sounds great
that's i don't see how that could go wrong unless we have a mole which is why if you simply
discover nobody's in space i don't know why they check but yeah actually you do highlight
surely life scanners would bring up a bit of an issue there if they're running yeah because those
are established so yeah that was actually accounted for why they didn't shoot the base
it's like because there's no life on the base why would they shoot that when they haven't you know
but i don't know man you you could have a throwaway line to be like we've got uh life
signals projecting from the ship we've managed to cloak them or signal life yeah we've set up
decoys or and if you have yeah if you have that plus plus the explanation this film could have
made a lot more sense i guess is where i'm going with that fortunately out of love and where po
learns to lead the rebellion with strategy and intelligence instead of a steadfast attitude but
most importantly it's instead of a steadfast attitude that's just so that's such a weird
dichotomy as if a steadfast attitude can't apply to bad tactics as well yeah part of stupidity
and ignorance as well that's not really those things are dichotomous all i can imagine is that
people would typically go with stubborn instead because the people typically use stubborn when
you're you're standing for something that shouldn't be stood for but uh steadfast yes also look at
this shot i like this shot i'm curious jay said he didn't like the cinematography of tlj i want him
to come back and comment on this one we got the same one right rags you see the luke walking
through the thing yeah he's got the the ships in the background yeah i like it a lot the walking
through the fire too right lib you don't like the the um the cinematography of tlj what's your
comment on this is it too easy maybe i'm curious what someone who doesn't like it would say i will
keep an eye on chat for a moment to see what people say because uh like i've said this before
but like the shot with luke dying i think it's a great shot i just not earned important that
we reach these places that's that's kind of the point of all stories is to once you reach the end
you got there thanks to the other stuff also rags did we lose aden and jay i don't know what to say
it seems as if at the moment it is just you and i well once again at the end well we're
not even at the fucking end we'll be going for another 10 hours who knows uh it's the big gay
it looks cool best shot of the film it looks good forgettable man it's too dramatic it's fine
it's fine uh what else we got it looks generic superficially it looks great not a big fan of
it looks good but with context it sucks weakness that moment him walking out was the only perfect
part of the film what do you what do you think rags what would you be what would you be your
paragraph statement on this shot of this um of this shot yeah it removed from any context
statement i'd say that the i don't know if i could put it into words right off the top of my head
i'd probably say something about the silhouette and how it contrasts against the light of the
outside and the foregrounds dark and you see the the shapes of the enemy in the distance that he's
walking towards and something like that hey for me appealing the idea that it's like you have a
black screen and then it's broken open by fire and he's walking through that fire into this world
with 8080s and ships and all this carnage i think it works as a great little representation of trying
to go beyond some form of depression if i was to get really interpretive of it and i'd be like
contexting this into a story that really matches that in some way uh could be great the unfortunate
thing is that i have to think about the film that actually reaches this moment which is utter
nonsense yeah it's the how did these things get here that i'm looking at and you're like oh
hey kux hey jay uh what do you see right now and watch together uh
pilot shit what no no seriously pilot shit pilot shit film no no no seriously uh i see luke uh
and there's some fire and there's like a big v in the sky and right right right so you said you
didn't like the uh the cinematography of this film what do you what do you don't like about this
shot i didn't say i dislike every shot no of course i'm i'm asking i'm just asking all right
this shot is cool um i don't see i really like the distinctive color scheme in this shot and
i feel like if the entire like sequence had this color scheme it would look a lot better to me
personally like if uh yeah the ground and everything was like the same but if it was
all like black yellow and white i think it'd be awesome uh so glib said it's obvious from a
compositing perspective that the fire is not there there is a green screen slash blue screen
about 10 feet in front of luke composition wise it's supposed to be a reflection on that shot
that he was doing when he said it's time for the jedi to end aka the searcher shot um whether or not
it's obvious that the fire is or is not there like i don't think it looks that to me i don't
think it looks that bad this this is kind of why i'm not convinced yet the the cinematography and
tlj is bad i don't want to go that well i never said it was bad no i'm not addressing you i'm
addressing like different people who've said that by the way um while i was gone someone tweeted at
me um that apparently and love and monsters and with the absol below that we were talking about
earlier yeah um well with the woman who's a paving slab apparently in the ending they acknowledge
they acknowledge that they have oral sex oh no really that happened really what do they say
what's the quote i don't know someone just tweet i'll read you the tweet um someone tweeted at me
um like the ending can i tell you both by the way the spiders are both gone i can't see where
they are anymore oh fuck it's like this is your goliath yes well i don't know with the
lore of efap i'm not supposed to be considered because they are truth tellers they are warning
me of something so i can't be too afraid what if they know something bad is destined for you in your
future that's still a good thing that they're getting the fuck out if they're trying to tell
me they're still good they're trying to prevent you from becoming like the next hitler unless
they're the cause of it maybe they're the cause of it that could be um someone tweeted at me like
the ending of of the absorbable off is really bad they literally acknowledge they do all the
episode is called love and monsters by the way that's all i have to go on so we don't know they've
sent me a clip as well we'll just search for this i'll do it someone must have written it sent me a
clip with a timestamp ripped love and monster why did that episode happen doctor who transcripts
love and monsters i'm just gonna scan right to the end um all right so the guy's name is elton
he says even then i wonder he fucking married a slab even then after all the doctor saved me one
last time and he picks up the paving slab from the desk here she is and she says could be worse
she says at least i'll never age and it's really quite peaceful you'd be surprised and elton says
it's a relationship of sorts but we manage we've even got a bit of a love life and she says let's
not go into that oh oh no that's a kid show it's peaceful i've got the clip here by the way
of course they say that rags because it's horrible it's horrific that's that's hell on earth i would
be like kill me yeah how can you die how she does she just says she doesn't age you gotta get the
doctor does she have to eat he has to screwdriver here back into like melted form and then throw
her into the sun he would do that he doesn't kill does he never kill is that true no he does kill
you he kills him like when the circumstances demand that he would he must kill or worse things
would happen he kills which is why the new doctor is well there you go that shit i was about to say
like he would kill her if she said worse things will happen if you don't kill me right the new
the new doctor it doesn't have like a rational um pacifistic outlook on life the new doctor has an
irrational phobia of guns i'm gonna i'm no i'm saving this for the video which when do you
predict that would be released i'm i'm gonna try and guarantee that it's gonna come out before
season 11 so that's gonna be within the next few months i guess it's gonna take a while well i'm
not done scripting it yet and it's gonna be a fucking thing for edit all right all right that's
fine all right okay let's let's watch the rest of this quinton really showing
front his greatest mistake and where kylo Ren's obsession with destroying the past gives the
rebellion the chance to escape now while i'm still very confused on the unseen path between episodes
six and seven i think that the last jedi should be universally commended for having an astounding
talent at illustrating basic concepts from the star wars universe which otherwise might have seemed
second nature all of the scenes involving luke training ray blew me away why why is he
introducing something that's new that's good about it um like two minutes before the end
this is what i mean man sounds like an opening statement
should i go what are you gonna say no no that's good it's fine i just i'm stuck all the way back
at like people say that my videos have no structure i always felt like i was i signpost
the structure i'm like here comes plot summary here comes summary here comes this section
usually not overt but i say like the wheel building is and then i talk about the wheel
building and i say the plot is and i do that with this video i don't even know like i don't
why didn't you put this this part about what's good about the movie
not right at the part where we're like you finishing up you know what i mean yeah it's
a strange move quintonian he's a part of a race called quinton's from quinton they sound like a
terrible terrible people which other centaur but with quinton twice might have seemed second
nature all of the scenes involving luke training ray blew me away with how well they explained the
jedi order without feeling too pandersome they explained the jedi order without feeling pandersome
they're completely one-sided luke skywalker explains how bad they are like that's part of
my issue i'd love someone to challenge him on it and ray does to a very small degree but we don't
really hear him respond it's kind of more of my issue with it i would actually love a debate
between two people about what the jedi meant to the world and what they did instead the one person
that i thought we'd catch defending the jedi was ripping on them and the one person who's never
heard of the jedi is defending them not really not really a great scenario what am i supposed to
do with that explain to me you'd have to i mean like give me for just for a debate about what the
jedi meant for the world i like i like the bear wouldn't say as far as as far as what is actually
happening in the last jedi specifically people are questioning pandersome we know what he means by
it but i don't think it's a word no probably right seriously doubt it's a word
bayouin said we must hold her on quintonius
um i'm not gonna say yes yeah but the scenes that really take the cake is the lightsaber
battles out of a lot about cake scenes that have been executed since the original star wars
most of the best ones come from episodes seven and eight i'm sorry i'm sorry hang on i want to
listen to it again he said the best lightsaber battles come from episodes uh seven and eight
and the this is the best one luke and kylo no the best one is uh the jedi my my this is the thing
i'm willing to argue but my favorite is darth vader versus luke and then secondly is darth maul
versus qui gon and obi one but for very different reasons for both of those um anakin and nubby one
i'm i'm sorry but i'm in the crowd of man that fight goes on for a while
i think it's like i like it but holy shit it's a long fight i prefer the emperor obi uh yoda one
like i think that's pretty cool the way that like it matches environment and uh the obi one anakin
one does too it's just that it's just it's just it's a long one i don't know i don't know what to
say i'm sorry long flight ban i still think it's a good fight like i don't know what to say about
that one where they spin for a good like four seconds and nobody hits each other that's hilarious
it's a weird moment i don't know what to say about it i want a choreographer to tell me what
he thinks about it i want george's commentary on why he decided that needed to be in there
oh hey rag should we do that sometime invite shad on and just watch all of the star wars battles
in a row have him have him say we could do that he thinks about him i don't know if that would be
tedious or if that would be fun i'm gonna go ahead and see what things and then they're gonna do that
as a series on his own channel though anyway yeah he doesn't tend to do that but well at that point
then if you didn't want to do it as a spoiler that'd be fine but if he did want to do it we'd
totally oblige because i'm curious if because lightsabers aren't real and something that we
could really compare to reality you understand how they would work well yeah he's made videos on
that clearly define mechanics he's made videos on how it should work and i think that there are
elements to each of the fights that make sense and some of them don't all right it depends on what
you can pull from this is completely wrong all right it's a universal yes from chat which makes
sense i don't know why i thought that it wouldn't be damn fine well i will i will contact shad
about it i think he wants to do it on his channel if he's not interested in doing it as a spoiler
for efap then we won't but maybe yes maybe yes i i like whenever shad talks about anything
like military medieval military or even modern military related i just sit there and listen i'm
just like and if you don't you're a bad person that's the morality i've gained hey hey we could
do the same thing with the john wick fights no don't do that people will be upset i was actually
thinking that people be upset if you if you have shad say the prequel fights don't make sense
because people will be like hey they don't make sense they just look good yeah i was gonna say
like i don't think any watching shad break down what one would do if dealing with a lightsaber
it reminds me of an i know chat will know the answer to this i won't but i remember seeing the
i think it's a clip from like one of the star wars games where someone deactivates their lightsaber
and activates it to get a a quick shot into somebody and it works it's the kind of thing i
think shad said people will be doing more with lightsaber fights because it can he said that
people would be trying to stay as far away from their opponent as possible and like reaching
their lightsaber oh sure that too but the idea that you can essentially like if you lock swords
at any point you can deactivate and activate and avoid their strike while getting an easy
strike on them sort of thing yeah fucking awesome to see this is the thing i think it would be
really cool to to hire shad first and then get a whole bunch of realistic fights because of course
just because something has an easy way to kill somebody doesn't necessarily mean you can't get
a long fight out of it you just got to reimagine how the fight would go so when um luke activates
his lightsaber in the scene does he actually use the correct button since he actually you know
mark will probably all right because the button is supposed to be matching up with what we see
right there right yeah because he's got his thumb on the right place to activate it hasn't he
i don't know enough about the lightsabers to be able to say but i'm gonna go in
i'm not sure but the button is the like a long square bit on the side
long rectangular bit even i don't i've never owned like a an officially licensed or
accurate to movie rendition of a lightsaber but i'm gonna go ahead and assume that
there's probably things people could point out about poorly activated lightsabers
i'm waiting for chat to react i don't want to push them yes he's correcting the right button
he does he's got it right i guess um it's not i guess that means it's not um jj abrams used
to blame for the people the actors pressing the wrong button i guess it's actually them he just
he's the director yeah i guess he he should have told them where to press but still
because mark i guess remembers yeah i i doubt that um it's jj's fault if someone fucks up
pressing the button the lightsaber is probably down to some kind of team in some way shape or
form some team that has a label you think you'd have like a lore checker we say this we've talked
about this before and i've said that there's a clip from a video that i i'm pretty sure i sent
it to myself i can probably find you know what remind me at the end of us finishing this video
it's only another half one a minute and a half long there's a there's a clip of people talking
about how ryan asked them if the kamikaze hyperspace thing was possible and they said yes
and they were like his team of people that he was supposed to contact whenever he thought
something was breaking law and they said yes they're the people that are technically responsible
if ryan was always going to submit to them in terms of accuracy so and that's insane
that they would say yeah this is fine it makes you wonder if they had like a pressure to just
go along with whatever what your team yes man basic basically yeah yes ryan yes ryan that's
brilliant ryan can i come in my nose ryan why would you say that all right look let's i want
to show that clip now so let's let's get through this course most of the best ones come from episode
seven and eight lucas has always described an original vision that he had of the lightsabers
being much heavier than they looked and the sabers in the sequel trilogy finally feel like
they show lucas's original image they just feel so much what it seemed the opposite
depends on what they seem even more weightless this this fight's really i even i think i said
in my review this felt this fight felt much more prequels than sequally like with luke spinning
around i was like how i'm surprised that you would refer to this one as heavy-handed or anything
heavy-handed yeah just showing footage of it because he has footage of it
maybe powerful in these two did you say so heavy footage gentlemen
no but that sounds funny i was in heavy-handed gentlemen hey we have to do a check aden
aden are you alive i can't wait for the idea that she actually wakes up from a nap and she's like
you guys are still going yeah we are of the other ones and they especially feel much more
deadly and while many might they feel much more deadly they chop a man's hands off a man's head
off two arms off a leg off no two legs and an arm off well they don't feel more deadly at all in
the new trilogy i got a side with robot head on this one the the sequel trilogy ones feel a lot
less deadly a first time you see one used in the new hope well the second time you see one
used in new hope it cuts a guy's arm just clean off when you're i guess used and depends on
whatever the you know is like does like turning it on equal usage but man i try to attack episode
eight for various issues pertaining to canon i really can't help but think that this is the
first movie to make all eight episodes feel totally connected what no no no no no no complete
opposite what do you mean this was connected all the episodes no please let's hear him qualify this
i really could spend hours talking about all of the little things that please don't in episode
eight but i feel like i've kept you he doesn't qualify that he just leaves it hanging oh jesus
rags why did you say that we need them to do this because we never know what their arguments are
they're like i could make all of my arguments but i won't they have a bucket but but
so to wrap this up the last jedi did a phenomenal job in convincing me that there was any potential
future for this franchise really i feel his features it's the opposite opposite
as it's so crazy because looking at this now that we've had all this time to gain perspective
it's just it's it's doubly idiotic now
like the like the the star wars the the general star wars fan base has never been so demoralized
they're all connected now rags don't you see it you see it
i mean i gotta be honest with you if you if you told me what's the movie in the star wars
franchise that feels the most like it does not give a shit that there were other movies and i'd
be like it's the last jedi obviously the last jedi easy easily followed by the force awakens
yeah it's a movie that is doing its own thing it doesn't care about other things that happen before
it just moves the fuck on right no he's saying that it's the least of those before this i really
didn't think that there were any new words to be uttered about the universe but this is absolutely
everything out of the last jedi and if it wasn't for the brilliant execution by director ryan
johnson i don't think i would be this excited to see what a faggot is he still excited for episode
nine is he honestly still excited like in an ironic way because me and you well all of us are
excited for episode nine we really are but not not in that way i thought you already highlighted
that it failed in like character plot and world stuff it is i just yeah but that's all fan stuff
no which is weird because you'd think that the stuff that had the most fan stuff would be the
one that would make you the most excited the most a fan well i guess a fan shit just doesn't matter
then how can you say that fan stuff just doesn't matter essentially and then give us opinions on
whether you think the value of the the star wars franchise is more or less beloved by fans yeah
like all of his arguments for whether or not this film is great is based on developing what came
before and yet all of the issues as he highlighted them were all fan stuff which naturally would
include the stuff that came before seems like cognitive dissonance to me what do you guys think
yeah he he just he's not he doesn't he's just a shitty reviewer i agree with you just a shitty
reviewer i mean guys if we can conclude on anything i think it's that quinton reviews
are some very good he's he's not very good i'm hot take i'm just gonna say this now his
newer videos have shown improvement um compared to what well certainly this but like uh is there a
51 video i didn't fact check it but um it was good it was a good video nice and informative
all right all right good information in it i don't i don't think the jokes didn't really land
for me a lot of the time but comedy is subjective i suppose i think once you reach a certain low
that you should naturally improve um i think you should always improve what i'm trying to say is
that any improvement you might see might just be a result of the fact that you hit some form of a
rock bomb but i i could agree that maybe this isn't maybe maybe when you said far from rock
bottom with this like this there are so many ways he could have made this much worse it's
pretty bad though like i know that it looks okay but like the weird racist sexist portions
the complete misinterpretation of what even happened in the film the structure being just
awful but yeah you could be like you could be tonaled but obviously he's not godlike so he
would never reach that level i was about to say yeah but he's not a god so
you know what quinton i hope you get better uh jade you understand that this is this is the nice
calm before we reach episode nine releasing where we can just address the last jedi stuff
we spent over a over like a year and a half talking about last jedi takes and we're still
not done we've got a whole bunch left people are still pissed at efap for not covering the
jenny nicolson one and the shawn one and that's just two of the many that we still have to do
but we're about to reach episode nine and that's gonna bring like a hundred new takes
should be fun no i'm still just sad that um i'm still just sad that the guy who did that response
to me about uh is the last jedi has taken his video down because that's related to the shawn
video as well wait your video got taken down no not my video okay i did a response to me um i
did a response to john um a guy did a response to me um which was hilarious um you've seen you saw
a quote from that right i showed you this isn't the awful one that we watched right
no no no no we didn't watch it it was sheep in a box is the guy right yeah okay um i showed you
the clip of it where um i say that um uh i respond to something shawn is saying where he's like oh
you shouldn't be picking out plot holes you know that's not what films are about um and i respond
to shawn by saying well yeah it's fine to not care about plot holes but uh the people who
um have their immersion broken by plot holes aren't wrong for caring and wrong for like you
know having that suspension of disbelief broken and this guy's unironic response to me is yes they
are they are wrong for caring about that be a difficult one to argue yeah i would have taken
my fucking video down too if i'd said something so said something so brain dead do we know the do
you know why it's down is it down for copyright it's down because he took it down it um it's um it
says it's still i checked the playlist he has of them it's all of them are still up except
that one which is private it might be copyright i don't know hmm that sounds like he made it private
that's unfortunate because we could have had a back a double bill of him criticizing you
and like he's gone after robot head right he's gone after shadow vicity as well too right
yeah he's gone after uh me robot head and chad also see we could have had a triple threat uh
thought he's um shad said bad things about tlg he's gone after sargon thorsky walker i believe
the channel channel is called that's someone that people want us to get on as well it'll happen
chat it'll happen you've been asking for aiden for a long time and as much as she may be sleeping
she's here her icon's still here yeah that's just picking up something
aiden aiden you there aiden aiden oh no aiden i summon you through the start it out so strong
e f a p e f a p aiden didn't work what do we do um kick me but yeah uh if if the shadow vicity
and robot head ones exist we could do a special episode where j shadow vicity and robot head me
and rags respond to a response to a response to a film how about that he's done two responses to
robot head oh well we'll pick the best one we'll ask robot head to pick the best one
it'll work two responses to robot head does this guy just have a problem with every correct
opinion that exists you can't say that rags us racist just because he's a sheep really
look at that silence the racism is silence just i don't think it would be shad's wrong robots
head rock sargon's wrong door is wrong everyone's wrong dude give it time you'll have one for me you
and efap in general this excited to see where the story is going i'm surprised he hasn't done either
of you yeah you think you think you're gonna have to meet you have to wolf you had a tangent
in the one about me where he talks about how bad efap is but oh what did he say yeah what did he
say um he was like i think he just called it right wing and like dismissed it as a right wing
podcast oh yeah it's just right wing it's just right wing which means i don't have to talk about
it because it's fucking right none of our points are uh they don't work if you're left wing they
just don't work all of it relies on being right wing for example we're responding to a video
it's only going to be accurate as a statement if you're right wing because videos means something
else to the left wing he's very right he's on point i guess i like him oh he's responded to
stephan molly q as well of course he is okay next chapter and that is thanks not just to the quality
of the last jedi but also to the unpredictability of it all i don't know what's going to happen in
the next film no one knows what's going to happen in the next film i like if you go ahead say i
like tlj because it makes things unpredictable i cannot disagree i like that um red lighted media's
evolution on tlj they keep commenting on how tlj every video now it's just there's no way to go
till j ended in a cave there's no way to go but backwards you gotta turn around because
there's nothing going forward i just yes i agree quinn to uh tlj means why is he showing
de Bruvnik Croatia this is where kanto bite was filmed oh oh there's poor poor see this
congratulations jay you've pointed out how a visual has no relevance to what he's talking about
come to efap it can't be what happens in episode six that's for certain and it's been an
impossibly long time since i've been able to go into a star wars movie without being able
to guess the plot and for that oh man i couldn't have guessed it either i could never celebrate a
creator for giving me the feeling of having no fucking clue of what's going to happen
um and you might be like but you said celebrate for that no no there were going to be but
what you're referring to probably means one of many circumstances what i'm referring to is
literally nothing to go on i have no idea where the ninth film is going to go
here's the thing like in the real world based on the real world rules
if something happens we could be like all right so that means you know these things
might happen as result and yeah like like i don't know things exist in reality and
the reality has rules to it like if someone said rags and mauler are gonna debate i hate
everything and quinton reviews we'd be like holy shit what's gonna happen so many things could
happen but if someone said rags and mauler gonna go to bars i'd be like what how does that happen
what in the i have no idea what's gonna happen that's just i i got nothing and someone's like
don't you prefer that latter vision where you have it's like no no no no no no because i have
no information this just sounds like it's invented and that's all that episode nine is
going to be in order to generate a plot they have to invent a shit ton to get the plot going
because they've got nothing and i'll tell you what the opening like 10 minutes or 15 minutes is
going to have a bunch of throwaway lines like oh man it's good that we made an alliance with the
ubeck way system in order to get this many troops and it's bad that kylo ren has suddenly
been able to control all of the first order and has now taken over the majority of the quadrant
of blah blah blah system um and then like a character's listening to that and is awkwardly
like i know all of this it's like yeah but the audience don't could we go explain it to them
i genuinely unironically hope that jar jar is in it people say yeah man like a bad thing i would
love jar jar to tear it up it would make me so happy it would it would genuinely make me happy
oh
by the way we are 14 seconds away from finishing this video
they cannot mistreat jar jar either if like someone kills jar jar or it gets hurt i will be
mad yeah i was gonna say if they created jar jar defenders if they created if they brought jar jar
into the narrative and had him die i would be upset and ironically yeah yeah you just brought
him here to kill him jar jar deserves he was just he was just sitting somewhere
sitting in uh well like they get ready to kill jar jar like this is what the fans want right
an old jar jar living off his pension from the senate just relaxing in retirement and then you
know episode nine knocks on his door and just freaking cuts him down you piece of shit we
violently murder him as the representative we're like fuck you sequel films he deserved better
oh i almost almost wanted to happen just to talk about jar jar
talk about what he meant to this universe talk about like hey if his if his characterization
was consistent with what we've got he's very aggressive and he's cute and he just doesn't like
learn the word i after all these days this island to die we're like jar jars inconsistent with
attack of the clothes oh like i said we don't know what's gonna happen it's gonna be a ride
a wild ride star wars movie without being able to guess the plot and for that i honestly can't love
this movie enough you love it because it was so crazy and bullshit and off the rails and
nonsensical that you couldn't guess the end reminds me of the whole it'll take a risk thing
and we referenced the whole taking a poop off a cliff thing and then people automatically assume
is it risky to take the poop and it's like no no it's risky you might kill somebody with the
terminal velocity poop that's the one i was thinking of yeah not necessarily terminal
velocity how big is this cliff are this cliff is the size of 17 000 suns what's the terminal
velocity of the poop seven miles is like nine point eight it's a good it's it's an absurdly
it's an absurdly solid and big poop it doesn't separate it doesn't separate
um stop saying that risky is good um alongside whatever the quinton said
i think you mean quinta quintonian
winter long quim i like how this video doesn't really answer the question of is the last jedi
that bad it's sort of just meanders around he says it he says it's good he says it's good
yeah he says it's good but he hasn't he doesn't actually yeah you'd think that if your video is
called is it that bad you would be explicitly going through all of the criticisms of it and
doing your best god bless you to try and convince us how it totally isn't bad guys
it's actually super technology that it is flawed in that way
yes i don't know what you said jay but i'm going to nod an agreement
i honestly a little icon just went green again and with that oh yeah it flicks on for just
moment that's all you get at the end of his video why Luke Skywalker is the most powerful jedi
why probably the process of elimination that's kind of funny that was funny it's not his fault
that it's kind of funny though he just took it from a thing yeah we did it yay that was
that was a long time i always feel like we beat our records every time we do this um
so what is life like what do we do next i guess memes right oh oh you know what um we should
probably get to super chats but there's one meme i want to watch with you folks and i know this is
people might be like hey stop picking favorites i just i'm sorry he knows who he is and i just
like his memes a lot sorry that that that i just i like the animations okay but you all should see
this you ready oh
so
creativity has allowed the passage of time the passage of time it's like i'm reading out some
ancient fucking tablet after i blow the dust away what does the inscription say it says
the passage of time someone's coming quick hide a bunch of Nazis like we have found the
temple of there is the monument in the obelisk quick grab it and bring it
into the plot of the first assassin's freaking i was i was getting for fucking the lost talk
whatever the ancient inscription okay i got it okay creativity has sorry creativity has allowed
the passage of time to bring new and interesting iterations on our gaming fundamentals so that is
what the ancient inscription of al habam says like it's a bad translation of an old text
wait yeah it's obviously in turn off subtitles you can't you can't do it in uh together but
that was great and how he he takes the art style of someone like weekend warrior
or death bullshit or whoever else like like like um uh voxis they'll convert them into ways that
they can match this what you would may call universe like they're there and they're exactly
as you'd imagine them to be it's just it's just great shit i love it and um i fucking love weekend
warrior's legs yeah and wolf's got his little cat um i don't know the cat yeah no but yeah he's
also got a yarmulke is that it's got a spider on it i don't i'm not sure what else i this is the i'm
too drunk to be able to go through the the video and explain all of the um the details this there's
going to be a lot of details i recommend going to the channel and pointing them out in the comment
section for uh played creations plagued creations that's the guy who makes these described with
notifications this i am subscribed as well these these these things are good there's other uh meme
videos they will we will view them uh someone's they've just reminded me the thing i wanted to
to show which i have i linked myself as crazy as that sounds or um because you know crazy story
crazy crazy story so i um i was looking at notifications and uh one night when i was going
to sleep and someone left a notification on my um star wars the last jedi critique part
i i want to say two it might have been three i don't know but as you guys will know yourselves
if you have a look i reference i say that i got hd clips of the kamikaze in um from this video
i forgot completely that i'd actually put that credit in there
and this video is called star wars the last jedi secrets explained like chewy this is where i got
my explanation of well my my footage from because obviously i try and find any place i can get hd
footage from instead of showing you guys like pirated stuff because it's just the whole reason
i have visuals is to fucking have evidence for my claims so when i'm talking about the hyperspace
kamikaze that what you'll want to see is the hyperspace kamikaze and um when watching this
video i've referenced it before but i completely forgot the link to this episode and this video is
from january 10th 2018 so this is before tlj got absolutely lambasted and so it's only partially
hated um there's a link it's called star wars the last jedi secrets explained it was released
like i said january 10th 2018 by star wars the channel and if we go to we're gonna have to pause
a lot because this is very much a copyrighted thing uh they start talking about the hyperspace
kamikaze and they mention whether or not uh that ryan came to them and asked them so i'm gonna do
my best to show it so 9 40 is apparently where i should be going to uh 9 9 40 like we'll we'll
play a bit when you're when you're on that that island that are kind of always reminding you that
you're in a really natural again i'm gonna i'm gonna pause a lot i i gotta admit um when i played
the memes from that other episode that got that got tagged with uh copyright i love memes but holy
shit is it annoying to have efap be uh stopped by copyright because i have to check every day to
make sure it's ready and then i have to download it and edit it ready for if the claim gets
concealed like like fully like if disney are like nope we're definitely stealing this it's like oh
okay um so so i'm gonna be careful with this kind of wild place wow that's super cool yeah
as a big porg fan every time there's an established when you say as a big porg fan you may as well
stop i'd like to think he's not a he's not a big fan of porgs like he's a fan of big porgs
like he likes him big he likes them he likes his porgs thick yeah he likes his porgs thick
a shot and you just hear this like porg calm i i keep getting there i swear to god has it been
confirmed that porgs look different they're still talking about porgs they're about to get into the
hyperspace kamikaze i'm gonna pause and then just talk about a bunch of random bullshit talking
about porgs period i'm sorry about this like chat i'm sorry okay what do you want for me i'm sorry
based on their sex the male porgs have the orange around their eyes and the more colorful oh my god
there's a difference between male and female porgs i didn't know this wow so that makes sense
does chewie's porg have a name no but that sounds like something you could get started
they probably put more effort into that than anything else
but we're showing a hashtag i feel like chewy would have named it and we
what was that jay you feel like chewy would have named it
uh so we would have named it
wouldn't be able to pronounce it oh see i think it looks like we're nearly there i swear to god
he would have named a porg han did you fucking catch that yeah that's definitely something
better these are the people who are in charge of making sure the law is consistent people
named a porg han he would definitely name a porg han because wow this this this fucking porg
he named han must have been the most amazing porg that ever fucking porged i'm picturing a whole
unit of people in a board room saying this and rags is just there and he fucking slams the desk
he's like you fucking serious right now like are you insane
chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about porgs he eats them he grills them he killed that porg
you know he does care about island here he does care about it fucking con solo he cares about him
i'm gonna name a fuck porg after him you know he doesn't care about doing actions in the sequel
trilogy hey man he was a chauffeur what else do you need it'll be improvement if they just like if he
was like if they walked in and i'm like having a wank or something that would be a step up yeah
i'd agree with that that's a step up all right let's let's kick on moving on moving on moving
on let's see what other details did we have to talk about there's a hardware wars call out when
we get into the wait i swear to okay let me let me just confirm for you guys exactly where i saw
the highlight the the image of the hyperspace kamikaze beginning is at 11 40 and so i thought
i would give us context by going from a little bit earlier let's go we still found stupid shit
to talk about oh shit the discord's not even on screen yet sorry there we go it's back now
um i'm going to jump in the head a little bit to make sure we got the right context all right
here we go it usually does but it's bb8's voice doing it i love that it's so funny there's some
great sound effect hilarious it's so funny there probably is some great i laughed allowed at how
amazing it was by the way someone sent me um someone sent me the apparently the guy who
did a response to me has posted his reasons for why he took it down someone sent me that what are
they there they are going to read that out sure can rags read that out because i'm a little bit
drunk sure i will read it out because i am not drunk why is your video on jay xy down
i thought it was a good video and now i cannot show it to my friend who thinks that those two
videos completely debunk debunk shawn's video is that the reason this is the question okay go on
can can you give me a spare copy or a link to it and i guess anon says a couple reasons or
he says a couple reasons one i wasn't happy with it for a number of reasons well yeah two
is you've listed here most notably that jay xy is not a right winger
and my star wars series was intended to mock right wingers but there are others as well
two in it i took a swipe at the word of wolf a fellow efap contributor and after he had a
breakdown and suicide attempt i didn't feel comfortable keeping it up i might change my
mind in the future and put it back up but right now it's probably staying down i'm afraid oh
all right then um i thought it took on shawn's video because shawn's video is fucking retarded
well that's the thing we'll cover it one day even if it means literally two years from now
we'll cover it um and i believe jay you want to be in that efap right
uh i i will i would be happy at this point you're probably okay with not being in it
but we'll have you with it anyway because it'll be fun to talk about this stuff but yeah uh
uh i mean that's not such a bad reason uh in terms of his motivation i just mean
you'd think you could clip it out whatever because i'm assuming the part where he talks
about efap at all is probably small compared to what he's responding to well yeah you can just
go back and the second reason is a good one the first one i didn't want to respond to him because
he was he's not right way he's not a right winger and i can't have a non right wing look bad on the
internet there is so much wrong with that like first of all who does he think is right wing and
secondly why is it why is it that you can only respond to right wingers so robot head hang on so
is robot head like i don't know i don't know right robot heads politics i don't care about
your politics when you're arguing about media is shad openly right wing is that is that thing that
again he well he actually has no idea against social justice which is enough to label you a
right winger right did you realize by the way we keep it on both sides and you can be
actively against the stupid wrong jay how could you can't call out people in your tribe
when say for example you know like efap me and rag's a host of efap if if rag said something
that i disagree with i cannot let people know that so if rag said something like last jedi is good
i gotta shut up i gotta shut up and be like yeah right not liking last jedi as part of your
tribe yeah so at that point he would be removed from the tribe rags you removed from the tribe
how could you bet yourself no i vote you off the island no rags is gonna change the tribe he's
saying that we we are pro tlj for a hundred bucks fuck it damn as as as john milestrup has highlighted
there is no such thing as moderation so according to a certain creator so yeah fuck it
anyway yeah let's hope i'm sure we're nearly there when bb rolls up with all the coins yeah
you can hear him jingle same thing when you know when bb ate shot the coins i was genuinely like
what the fuck he has a coin shooter built into him and the the alien gremlin man like posted like
fucking 50 coins into him okay all right fine whatever okay he just had the cop those coins in
and bb ate never just rolled away it's a coin i guess i guess it's free hey i guess bb ate you
know if he shoots them are people right he shoots them he doesn't use them to purchase things i guess
that's right i guess he was planning he was planning on spending it on like hookers and blow
but but he realized that not even prostitutes a picture like as good as your friends
a fucking high bb ate and they're like bb we don't get out of here and he's like
why do you want to get out of here man i just fucking poked off his tits he's like
fucking out of here yeah fucking i'll fucking do that right now fucking yeah let's get out of here
let's go let's yeah you can choose one of two you're like is he hyper i need to listen to this
tune hang on listen listen to this listen to the song i have okay what do you think of this what
do you think oh this is just fucking amazing okay right listen this bit this bit this bit
yeah that was fucking awesome it's just like the most neutral normal beat ever just more often
we're nearly there i swear yeah it's like you can hear that he's full of loose change yeah
the sound design and this was just hilarious spectacular i mean i want rags to be on this
paddle they're like the sound design was just terrible hell it why did you say that yeah you
like you guys know it would be a fuck up if he didn't sound like that you're not super clever
for having it be the way it should yeah i'll admit having several tens of coins inside bb8
there like narratively and then having him move around and the sound of coins jangling being
there is like okay that's normal that should be there congratulations but hey if you're the
entire team behind everything you're gonna pat yourselves on the back for the job you did with
tlj we did a good job my favorite moment in the entire movie and quite possibly one of
my new favorite moments in star wars is that moment of silence oh yeah oh yeah now what
moment of silence you're talking about the hyperspace kamikaze what do you guys think
of the fact that they that we have the moment it's a world shot made moment and if it made
sense in the canon it would be fucking awesome that's my take congratulations it's literally
like ray holding her lightsaber up and saying i am the power i then she turns into she-man it's
it's one of the couple of moments in the film where i was like man that was cool and then your
brain your brain's almost trapped in a cage while your heart is like la la la la la la
and your brain's like hey hey i was glad because holdo died in that scene so no one's ever really
gone imagine you saw the scene again but entirely from her perspective and she pulls the thing she
goes and then her body is slowly separated into a billion pieces and she's like
and probably be just instant no i'm saying like from her perspective for some reason it's slow
motion i don't know if i want her to like suffer painful that's what i mean that's what i'm getting
how fucking awkward it would be from from seeing that alone and you find out all the information
later but that's their experience and we're like oh my god that's horrible Jesus christ
and uh yeah they established that that's why nobody does it are you saying that she should
have been separated into one point two oh boy this is i was i was listening i listened to that clip
earlier i like i was on epat.me and that clip is there and i just played it uh i know i don't you
know obviously none of you guys can hear it but just when he went brilliant i just couldn't contain
my fucking laughter i don't know if you can just like a random part of this you'll just hear me
laughing to myself for no reason that's why it's one of those ones where you're like how did that
become a meme and you're like you don't you don't question it it's such a good clip it's an amazing
anyway we're almost there i'm sure of it yeah can is there any specific inspiration that went
into that or what i'm gonna pause it again because i'm pretty sure we're nearly there
it was the process of creating that moment because it's all i know
talk again just talk so that we can separate this so that the youtube bots don't come after us
my google chrome is i'm in love with a beautiful girl
all right now is ryan he had it in this story pretty early on uh-huh only because he's the
holdo the hero yes he was holdo the hero scene holdo the hero holdo the hero scene that's what
she's the hero she did something that no one else had told me that she was a planted first
order agent yeah have you heard that that's supposed to be what hux is he's supposed to
be a planted resistance hero sure oh man he must be playing he must be playing the law this is why
when i heard about this theory and people were like hux is going to be that i was like oh i wish
i'd voted for hux uh rags you oh hey everyone is a double agent for the other side it would
unironically sense they just don't know it they just don't know it but everyone's a double agent
every they're not allowed to tell each other and they can't report back to the superior years
like like ray reveals it to uh poe and poe was like no no i i'm agent 742 she's like you're
agent 742 i'm agent 743 he's like oh fuck the fit is like oh i'm agent 741 like oh jesus christ
oh my god they just switch sides everyone does anyway it's like it's like you know that you know
that meme of like um like these uh two women coming out to like that dad i think is uh gay
and he's like for fuck's sake does anyone like cock in this house and the son walks past like
i do it's like that but like for the resistance replace cock for the resistance is anyone fighting
for the resistance in this house and like hux walks past i am i'm also this is it i'm pretty
sure this is the this is the thing that i was talking about i was asking about the dynamics
and the physics and the you know star wars physics of could a ship do this what does it mean uh does
this upset anything and we're like well the fact that uh i'm gonna pause it again because this is
a long clip but you hear that he said that ryan asked us about the physics the star wars physics
of whether or not this is possible he's got a pork shirt on do you get this though that this
this is important i know if he's got a pork shirt on this is the guy who was asked by ryan johnson
if this is possible possible which of those pokes do you think is hard
why does he have a shit with four porgs that just says star wars
it's like imagine like you're right like you're an adult male and you
purchase that shirt you specifically purchased a shirt that says star wars with four porgs on it
i can't i i just what a world i have to imagine being an adult male well maybe me no it's not the
imagining of the adult male part it's the buying people people are saying pablo hidalgo is this
pablo hidalgo that's a made-up name pablo
are you guys aware of the breaking bad movie by the way oh shit i think that is pablo hidalgo
i thought but people have told me that wouldn't it
that is pablo hidalgo people have told me that pablo hidalgo is the guy that should take over star
wars oh no unironically people have told me that i should have advocated for him taking over star
wars he's the fucking guy behind the the holdo thing like okay i'll play the rest of this here we go
the resistance cruiser and the negative destroyer are are so close in size i mean obviously one's
still much bigger is that kind of what i want you to have this titanic explosion no they aren't
anywhere close they're not any anywhere close in size they are not even what what the fuck is
wrong with this man no no did he am i miss am i mishearing him is he saying that they're
close in size that is what he said let's draw it back he's actually retarded let's draw it back
we're doing it let's double check because that can't be true we're so close in size i mean
obviously one's still much bigger he says they are so close in size but obviously one is still
bigger much bigger you're a little bit bigger they're not close in size they're close in size
in the same way that an orange and a planet are the close maybe i'm being extreme that is slightly
hyperbolic but i think people know what you're getting oh dave falloni pablo hidalgo dave falloni
is the one that should take over not pablo sorry i feel like this is the thing i don't know enough
about this i think is falloni the one that does the clone wars falloni the clone dave falloni yes
pablo no that's what chat is saying okay chat i am very sorry i may have combined them i don't know
who pablo hidalgo is like is he just a terrible place that does star wars lord just keeps fucking
everything up all right let's play the rest of this or at least as much as i believe a terrible
person who does star wars lord or he does that kind of allows you to have this titanic explosion
that happens like if you flew an x-wing into a ship at high speed you're not going to get that
a death star he said if you fly an x-wing into a high speed into a ship you're not going to get
that why why not yeah like actually why isn't that true too small why they're not similar in size
okay i can't remember if i send this to my video but a penny going at light speed and not losing
its integrity like not burning up uh going through anything will fucking punch a hole there's just no
way you know you can calculate how fast dragonfly has to hit an 18-wheeler in order for it to stop
the 18-wheeler like we we have mathematical calculations we could do to find this out
like this isn't like pure science isn't it told that you can't drop a penny from towers because
it can kill people no yeah that's not true is that not true no it's that it reaches its terminal
velocity before it um it's what's the speed at which it falls at terminal velocity then
i don't know but it's lower than not enough to kill someone is what you're saying
yeah all right but i'm just i'm wondering maybe that maybe he said all this to ryan before
like the supremacy had been like drawn up and like he saw it so ryan was just saying oh this
is clearly post-movie so he's okay with it yeah but he maybe he's just reciting what he said to
ryan i'm doing devil's advocate here maybe he was just like oh yeah snoke star destroyer so he was
picturing like a normal sized star destroyer and like that would be similar in size to the radars
also for reference because chat i'm trying to save you chat referencing it going at terminal
velocity isn't necessarily the same as being fired into hyperspace yes that's true jay knows
this too so a penny at hyperspace is going to be different than a penny dropped off a tower
and hyperspace mate a penny going faster than light and may indeed kill you yeah
what do you mean maybe maybe well i think the problem is if you went faster than light you'd
start going backwards in time and you would arrive at your destination before you let what
rags is confusing but yeah so i wanted to bring this so how many people have you heard talk about
this that this guy is the reason that it happened rather than ryan johnson well i think ryan is also
kind of the reason no i don't think so if if i ask jay if if i'm making a doctor who episode
and i've been hired on i'm told to make it within a certain amount of time so i can't watch the whole
show and i'm writing it and i go uh jay can daleks fly and you go no they can't fly i'm
like they can't fly you go nope absolutely no daleks can fly catch it well no no i'm saying
darks can fly as of the new who but i'm saying that if jay told me that they can't
then i would be breaking law if i said this dalek can't get up the stairs because darks obviously
can't fly so i have to invent something else and then the the viewers would be like but they can
fly they fly in new who post 2005 and you'd be like fuck so you get what i mean right and they
fly post 1989 oh i thought it was invented in dr season one it was invented in uh tv serial
called remembrance of the daleks well but you get what i mean right like if you an imperial
faction dalek flies up the stairs if you and while they were filming that scene the guys in the
dalek vomited because um they were like actually pulling it up on like wood it wasn't cgi okay
they had like a whole rig to pull the dalek up the stairs but you get what i mean if i'm asking
you the question then holding me responsible is a little bit unfair i suppose yeah like rex if i
told you is is it can a lightsaber go through paper and you told me no is it my fault that i
have them get stuck on paper you're being an idiot at that point yeah i but yeah ultimately
it still is your fault because you are the director i mean you can take responsibility
i agree with that yeah i mean well i mean i guess yeah it's your responsibility but it sucks that
this is the one that was informing ryan johnson not to say that ryan johnson uh isn't faultless
of course he is but if you had this guy informing you on what the correct and incorrect visions of
the law are of course you end up with something like the last jedi you know what i mean he's
fucking telling him that yeah this does this makes totally sense 100% i'm gonna get that if
something as big as holo shit does what it does but in terms of how it was staged that's just insane
i think we were all caught by surprise at how in terms of how it was staged i think we were all
caught by surprise because it's not possible that's why it's quiet brain i don't
uh what are we supposed to say i don't know but where is it to go from this i i still conclude
that ryan is responsible for tlj but um oh yeah jay you're the doctor who knew it i believe you
that flying was invented before knew who but i i'm just saying is it a reference if someone asked me
as the star wars law expert is it possible to force choke someone did i say no at that
point you'll be questioning have you even seen a star that's that's the difference i suppose
couldn't ryan johnson have just watched them yeah it's not that many all you would have to
do is watch them it's not that many ryan that's obvious he's like oh you have to do the new star
wars movies like obviously watching all the star wars movies is on your to-do list before anything
else watching the material i so yeah it is his fault because he should have known it because
it was it was really beautiful especially the sound i didn't know that they were gonna and
they're talking about how visually and audially it's beautiful like yeah yeah it's gorgeous but
it's it makes no sense it breaks stuff but i feel like uh this is something that most people didn't
seem to know about because i was never told about it that this guy admits here that ryan asked about
it which is better than him just doing it randomly you know i mean yeah it is a step up yeah and it
fucking sucks that there was somebody who could have stopped it but he didn't and according to
chat uh there's a lot of hate for this guy uh so it it's it's expected a lot of people are saying
check mark hamill's twitter i'm seeing that a lot what is that about has he tweeted something just
now it says i'm having a look tweeting he's got
okay that's about trump that's probably not what they're looking for that's about
anything about star wars
he tweets a lot about trump actually he's some he's some hollywood guy with a kajillion billion
dollars who of course of course not what a rich feeling what tweet are you give me a keyword
what tweet are you looking for chat tell me give me a keyword a word that applies to the tweet
that doesn't apply to any other tweet typically very curious now because of the could be it could
be this mark's tweet is bad and shaming children it's the trump one presented it kills again
abortion oh my is this relevant to efap or is this going to be some kind of political thing
is this tweet about trump going to be a political thing well not all of his tweets are about trump
at least trump star wars trump tweet deleted latest one latest trump latest latest tweet
not this trump probably something about evanka and her kids so evanka put out a tweet saying
the force is strong in my family and it shows her kids playing with this one of your kids has
a stone trooper outfit on and he quote tweeted it and said you misspelled fraud hashtag go
fuck yourself go hashtag mark ham wow yes good job mark go after fucking evanka's kids because
i don't like trump so just i guess fuck evanka's kids yeah i gotta be honest guys that's not
why would you how dare your father be somebody damn yeah and all of the top responses right now
are you sure own those kids mark way to attack a child mom why does luke skywalker hate us because
we're terrible son we're terrible damn your father's because your father's the orange man
yeah i gotta admit like you know throw in throw in hate at trump i see that constantly so i'm just
like okay but trump's son i'm assuming that's that's the case like good job mark or his son's
son i don't know who who it is exactly but oh not a great look um damn i take back what i said
about the last jedi seems luke is the type to cut down kids over things their family
fucking hell but it would be like i like i didn't like obama but i wasn't like yeah his
kid his daughter yeah fuck her his kid dressing up in something related to star wars go fuck
yourself like okay jesus fuck yourself because your dad is someone i don't like like very adult
of you mark that's good that's a good role yeah what was all that about being a good role
i feel like mark should regret that to a degree that's not a great yeah i definitely would
uh jesus
that's as awkward as this sounds so are you guys ready for some memes i just already got a couple
but yeah sure that's it for watch together we are we are through that we got some memes ready and
then we're going to go super chat even though this is probably the longest efap that's been
content wise outside of the jackson one fuck this has been going for nine hours yep we're at
night i got three hours to read out super chats i gotta i gotta be fast running on that one uh
make sure i get them but okay so we go and also if someone pointed out in the chat i mean the irony
of the character luke skywalker being angry at a kid because of who the kid's father is um yep yep
uh
we have additional renditions of the uh the grimace and they even have a reference
can i just say this is why i love the efap community like why would this exist and yet it does
it does and i i love like the big fanos
the pupils as well they took some creative license with their pupils
uh it's so great no they're blue they're blue no i i mean the location of the pupils
uh they it's they're still in the they're facing different directions like they are in the reference
material you're right um rags you'll you'll love this i believe this was when you got that phone
phone your phone started thingy-ing dad don't you understand
i got it by the way he i didn't pick it up and say that just in case anyone the chat is a little
confused okay i'm retarded i'm drunk so what is what is the context you what am i missing
i'm not sure this was referenced as a as an efap meme i i feel like chat you're gonna have to
explain this the bottom looks like there's a steven universe character that looks like
the one at the bottom there's a living pumpkin in steven universe that might be what that is
um it looks kind of like that people there was a comment on efap 53 i think it was from um
george i've talked to him before but he said something like once now that efap 50 has happened
24-hour efaps will become the norm it's like that's supposed to be a joke damn it one a year
it's like yes a year from now when we get to our two-year anniversary whenever that is
sure you can you it would be reasonable to expect another efap that goes 24 hours yes
steven universe pumpkin is that aden pumpkins are alive is that aden people are guessing that's aden
might be no what are the it might wait wait wait wait wait wait aden did you say something
hello hey aden aden yep hello i just came to hug you hey my mom apparently showed up so
did you fall asleep saved us i may fall a little bit of sleep that's okay okay
did you have pleasant dreams let let them have their moment
i just came here to hug you my mom is just doing your thing and jesus christ
that's an efap first
she fell asleep that's so adorable
no i absolutely love the idea that she actually managed to fall asleep despite
a headset or earbuds that had us in her ears the whole time no no no it wasn't that bad
were we not loud i feel like we shouted a couple times no i don't want to know it's fun
i just okay are you back or do you because i was gonna say if you want to leave because
i think her mom's there i think she's doing uh okay taking care of all that i was just gonna
say don't leave let me promote your channel before you leave that's all if you want to leave
apparently we're currently looking at an aden meme so i'm i'm all cool i'm just like oh man
yeah you you managed to have a nap in an efap and survive till the efap's not even over
and but i had to have a little bit of a nap
my god it's so insufferable efap oh my god no kyle ben yeah well a lot of things are insufferable
but fuck man but do you do you feel recognition with this new meme that we've just posted in the
chat do you what do you think people are saying this is you apparently i i'm trying to find the
references i'm guessing the chat is just full of people saying e nap i'm sorry we did it that way
too much to drink you think yeah yeah that's a problem i don't know how you guys can stay up
so late i'll be i'm gonna level with you i can't believe we're at nine hours if you had told me
what how much we'd gone to i'd been like oh like four probably four maybe five this is actually
longer than average yes okay this i i have to say in my defense i just got really sleepy
i've lost a long time people normally fall asleep
dude have we broken records with how long are faps our faps are i mean who who streams this
long this is kind of uh kind of weird but also yeah we're not we're not normal people no
as i believe i said well probably right into this no this too but i'm on complete british time
which makes it right now almost five a.m yes oh gods man that's why i can't start the new day
ironically i usually i usually go to sleep it's seven we've got we've got three memes to get
through and then i gotta start rushing the super chat i can't believe i'm saying this
we only have three hours to get through super chats okay
so we've got to make sure we actually look at these things to make sure we reply in time
we got efap wake up now wake up aden i think that's pretty cute
oh be fair i did get too tired
oh oh shit there we go uh this screen's getting a bit blurry for me i'm really gonna
stay sane aden suffers heart attack dies at work efap gather for the group selfie thinking she'd
fall asleep that's sad that it actually happened it was a dead part i'm just thinking about the
real world thing this this meme came from i don't need to contextualize this this is just funny
this is the whole like everything is political
with her
all right no more memes
gonna no more memes i'm gonna talk about super chat now all future memes will be addressed
in future efaps how's that for uh well what if they're about me one more meme what if they're
that what if they're specific to this podcast yeah one more meme what what if there's three
more memes what about that one three more and we're looking at three more memes aren't we three
more memes are you racist more memes
hey teacher leave that kid alone leave those names alone
i'm referencing quinton reviews his review of dlj doesn't get any sense at all you know what aden
you may have had a nap you're probably more coherent than any of us are as a result no i'm
good but this one because i had the power to rejuvenate um after watching a little bit of
quinton reviews which is yeah he draws a lot of your power out of you that's part of his
life cycle can't let him do that you have to maintain just a little bit just a little bit
of energy psychic energy to be able to to fight back against the power of god where the hell
find three memes three names three memes this is the first one
nuderotic bash the wall wanna fap that mola i mean i feel like me and rags bash the wall so
you know maybe nuderotic is in good company maybe i don't know i'd talk to him oh okay
nuderotic is my buffy fan so i'm totally on board with discussing things with him it's all good i
i took that literally as bash the wall bash the fash
as as chat pointed out aden constantly reads psychology studies and efap is what put her to
sleep oh no okay wait let me ask aden how many nine hour podcasts have you been a part of
none one i did i did tell you you know it's pretty funny that you messaged me and you were
like i don't know if you've ever watched efap before and i think my response was like oh yeah
yeah yeah like i listened a lot of times but man i can't stay up i i i think my exact response to
molar was i might go to sleep at some point because i'll be tired but again okay we'd be
clear we'd be clear in my perspective right now it's four o'clock in the morning five o'clock in
the morning same yeah for me we're all on the same time except for rags 10 33 pm rags is like
oh man i might be heading toward a decent time to sleep soon it's four a.m yeah same same for me
and poor little j i know i know i know i know you got up just before the stream started i got about
five that was two and a half hours before we started look i i live entirely on gmt time so
like basically yep it's like this is i gotta be honest with you when people watch the um
the re-uploads i honestly feel like when they get to the points like this they they walk they're in
their job or they're walking across like they're walking to someone and it's like i can't empathize
with this i've been listening to this in my day today and they're all talking about being tired
and stuff i'm like sir slash ma'am we've been running now for for nine hours you're listening
to a podcast that's been running for nine hours and we're not even into the last section yet that
i have to finish otherwise it'll fuck up future future podcasts can i just smack me a little bit
no i'll be up yeah there we go you know we we well we did the 24 hour one you know so
it's this is just this is play time compared to that uh final meme final meme for uh for the
night possibly final meme final meme here we go it's the 3d man again oh no guest hit list
aden apparently i plunged a sword into your back you got the little martini
i was unsuccessful with your death apparently because i was like i was thinking like hit list
is that like a starlinist but for hitler that's how lost we are people that's how fucked up
everything in the brain is at this point um all right so is it can i we am i allowed to
start talking about super jazz now well um you said you said three more memes right i was three
oh three we had we had the meme of uh the exterminate all subjectivity
winton connecting everything and me stabbing aden which i do not approve of that was that was a
you know you probably should because i got real really tired and you know sometimes you
gotta stab somebody to wake them up i'll be honest with you the best time for you to wake
back up was be when we do super chats because there's gonna be a bunch of things in relation
to you now they'll be like oh hey you had aden as a guest you know there might be questions so
here now i yep i am here now let me just load all of the pages that are relevant because oh no
there's more than three pages okay still part of waking up is super chats from europe and also
jesus christen okay all right i have to be very honest um i don't stay up this late
at all ever that's okay so if anyone ever says efap doesn't change lives well there you have it
we've changed my night we also change schedules
i did actually be kind of clear which was that i said like oh yeah i i'm cool to come on at
seven p.m um but i don't know if it was made completely clear that i usually go to bed at like
what night we only ever invite efap guests that don't sleep did do you sleep is that a thing
no to be fair not frequently happy to help um glad i could help yeah so i want to address i
completely i don't know how you guys are up to sleep i'm kind of tired i could still go here
at practice i guess like four a long time i'm like oh man i woke up at one this afternoon
and mola woke up at five this afternoon look i don't want any memes about how like the typical
meme joke is nine hours that's really short it should be blah blah i want memes about okay mola
this is too long too long a meme enough of that you know let's finally hear that is bad to be
honest they were already 24 hour one established the long man was wrong at like four hours two
hours even wrong man nine hours i mean i was facing that off of of completely after an academic
yes several polls were run i ran into the center of Cardiff i said everybody is the long man long
and some guy was like the fuck you talking about and i was like that's a yes i'm gonna put that down
rags that's not the only accent from from wales talk as a posh british man do it
you what better that's better i'll give you i'll give you that
that's like the butler voice well in fairness to rags we have the same thing we would go
hey how you do it over there my name is rags and i like chicken you know like this is thought
well god damn it looks like where we're over in texas you know why does the slave have to be
from wales if i'm extremely offended um because i'm from wales okay what does that mean did you
why is that offense but but i i mean the sleep i i'm very upset by this but the but the time
zone is the same as as england you're very upset that he's welsh oh no no i'm very i'm very
i'm very upset that there's discrimination against the welsh they but i said Cardiff that's in wales
yes it is i don't i don't why is there such and why is there such discrimination against the
welsh that's what i always want to know i'll tell you why it goes all the way back to hitler
when he tried to take over uh places they were like you know what he shouldn't take over america
he shouldn't take over britain except wales he shouldn't take over and be like whoa whoa what
did you just say no i'm saying absolutely fuck sheep you can't say that that's racist this racism
continues as long as it a lot is as long as it is directed against the welsh and kumri will rise
again well if they just stopped fucking you know i appreciate that the one thing the one thing that
we i'm so offended that aden j and rags you all agree on welsh have the best flag in the world
we we fuck over everybody on that front let's get you know it's all right there's a second flag
with a dragon on it well well who's what is it who Sri Lanka i'm not sure let me find out bang
is it's Sri Lanka and and um bang or if they did they copied us and they did it badly flag
flag of Bhutan i don't know where that is Bhutan how do you spell that b h u t a n
b h u t a n yep yeah still not as cool as i was there's see this is like a dragon yeah that's
cool but it's on like a weird background exactly fucking anglos fuck off kumri will rise again
just look at that it's like yeah it's cool enough but wales is way better we're on like a grassy
field with a nice clear sky wales look at that these motherfuckers are are mad that they
what dragon that they don't actually get king arthur is theirs and ironically whatever people
talk about wales i'm like you know well we win the dragon flag fight so fuck you that's all that
matters when they were designing this flag you must have been like damn you guys you knew what
you were doing he was like wow you you must be fucking badass of a country and they're like
wales is not even literally a country a rags efap originates technically in wales so how badass
is that hang on hang on why the fuck is there a google search a version of the world's flag
but with a lobster just clean your room back up i don't know what that means but it's wrong
there's a lobster one in the bottom right of your of the stream right now
because we must organize our society where's the lobster one you said again this would be
the right oh why is there a lobster what what what does the lobster mean
it means we have a red lobster here and it's open till 10 on you know what lobsters lobsters are
kind of cool you know they snap yeah they're armored they have weapons on each hand yeah
it's kind of cool cool right i'll admit dragons are cooler right but lobsters are okay well if
what i don't know i thought experiment thought experiment what if the lobster was the size of a
dragon i don't know yeah and it could fly well even even if it couldn't fly right if it was just
like a a fully armored double clawed mandibled big brownish sea monster again i think jordan
peterson is important here what the lobster it looks like mr crab why is that bad right
what is happening why is it oh it's me lucky dollar
stop it i've been there i know that place stop it stop flying the cool
the darn cool dragon flag the dragon flag is badass that's what dragon flag is bad as a shit
this is this is all let me i'll tell you what's going on anglers are always mad that their
flag's not as cool as ours so they get angry that no one have a dragon so let me let me tell you a
bit of weird vague uh welsh history that i was told and this is totally biased because welsh
people would of course tell welsh people this is the thing because i'm literally i'm moving to the
uk four days and i get to finally research my family's history is so how are you i was told
this in year four which means i was four five six seven eight nine years old i think so my memory is
is spotty but this image is the best i can find of it actually sort of depicting it but there
was like a welshman and an englishman talking about how they're going to kill each other
i think this is really bad anybody who's like molly you're wrong i'll be like absolutely i'm
wrong because i don't remember this very well english and welshman want to kill each other
they found a box and they opened the box and there was a red dragon and a white dragon and
they were like okay pick a dragon we'll make them fight and whoever wins means that the country's
better i guess that general idea goes back to series that goes back to the um the ancient
ancient text again i'm not aware of frags so like the the welsh chose the red dragon and the
english chose the white dragon and the red dragon kicked the well the white dragon's ass and well
the welsh were like well fuck you we're awesome we're gonna put it on his flag and the english
were like fine go away that's my story it's not completely incorrect but it's basically because
the the red dragon would have been the the dragon of um arthur of uther uh that that's the
welsh dragon i don't i don't claim many victories for wales uh like i literally claim none but the
dragon flag like there is no better flag such a fucking cool flag i will i will i would definitely
fight for the flag it's the best flag uh uh honestly this creature in some kind of movie
this high production animated full cgi absolutely claim victory on for wales is that torchwood
episode no torch was all set in wales that's not even fair no no no the good season is set in wales
is so bad well all of the seasons are set in blooded are they no no most of it's set in card of
torchwood season but the good season being set in england doesn't help us jay
yeah you get the alien that fucks people to death no
children of earth is set in london mostly isn't it well absolutely but that's not a good thing
why would you bring that up it doesn't help all of torchwood all of torchwood is set in card of
no children of earth is in fucking london that's where the season happens
like most of it most of it so some of it is in wales what do you think there are parts of it
kind of yeah most of the while since i've watched that to be fair i know i haven't watched it in
years i would however say gwen's uh gwen needs to just move her teeth together yes sure sure
that's my aden what do you think about the fact that in his second episode on the series she
tries to fuck the prisoner how about she's constantly trying to fuck her boss
just he's pretty called out and then seems upset about it jack's pretty
can we be honest jack's pretty attractive yes oh yes jack is attracted to all genders and
to all manner of people find jack harkness attractive but
uh she's annoying to many groups outside of of her bisexual status um which probably would be
not um acceptable today for some reason or another you know oh no yeah i want to highlight
this one in the discord said in reference to my story welshman we use dragon fight see which land
people better englishman such a proper deal indeed i pick the white one you welsh chap
red dragon wins welshman shrek noises englishman what a fine duel i bid you adieu welshman staples
red dragon to flag and sluts furiously while playing bagpipes i'm coming back i'm coming back
and now there's no stopping me i'm taking a silent look look it's okay we've got the flag
that's all we needed the flag was it that's i don't claim anything else we just have the best
flag it means nothing but ultimately it means everything because everyone has a flag to be
fair i'm really lazy but as long as i can claim that wales is cool because we have an awesome
flag then yeah it's about people like oh don't you care about the substance of wales politics
people you're like no we have a cool flag i think i love man i love man let's have a look yeah is lay
oh man he's leaving man flank
why would you say that
what does it mean rag
did i'm sorry did you did you just let me just say is a sleigh of man
i don't know what the stream needs to see it
oh no baller keep it together
you can't you can't lose some island man flag not after all we go through
all the way so you replace it with a foot
you call it a swag
it's three legs why would you just three legs in like a shuriken shape guaranteed to kick anything
it is i want to see this creature rolling along
if all of the flags were personified into creatures and made to fight each other
oh the welsh flag just looks at this three-legged creature i would watch the
it's got no face the welsh the welsh flag of me just be confused why do i have to fight this
i mean it's it's a dragon you're probably wearing armor it's wearing armor it's an armored leg
that's true with stirrups so it's ready to write some kind of well not stirrups what are they what
are they called the the all right legs it doesn't even make sense
i just want to point out the super chat's relevant it's just a cheap swastika
spurs the problem is you know they're one of those kids they're trying not to do their
swastika pose for instagram and they just couldn't get it quite right they grew a third leg
i feel like i haven't seen that before that's amazing i come from a culture that is very
pride proud of its flag uh i can't imagine conversations where flags come up you're like
oh i know uh what what is what is a flag really let's you guys i really don't have a lot of
experience with the isle of man flag before apparently not because i didn't know that there
was such a flag that has three legs my goodness i never talked about this i come from a place
that flags are cool okay not gay weird why would you have a flag like this but you guys have both
lived or existed around the uk you didn't know this is one of the the major celtic flags we
didn't get taught all of the flags i'll be honest with you we got taught the cool flags
this is the coolest leg besides you you think there's a cool flag oh yeah
that's okay how does it get cooler then you think that thing you can't even finish the
sentence you're full of shit you can't say that's a cool flag how does it get cooler
you know rags that's a cooler flag i'll give it to you it's just it's a person's face
that's a cooler flag than three legs attached to each other in some kind of weird
three legs and a thong come on it's really cool that is kind of a thong why is
wait what a thong why how's that someone draw a luge what else would you call what they're wearing
what else would you call the three legs wearing in terms of their oh no i was referring to the
rags posts i didn't realize that we were dealing with more things we're supposed to be on superchase
we haven't even started what is what is this now communist spider-man what why why am i looking at
this this is it's never been so hard to to run an efap a solid four minutes laughing at the
isle of man flag have you you say you say that as if we've stopped look at this what is this
it's an actual creature that attacks you in taxels apparently i haven't played this one
it's beautiful
what happens if you push it over
that's a secret weakness
the night makes us so much better
i like that he hasn't even raised his sword he's just like what is this
is this on my side or not i don't even know satan what have you sent me to fight
it has to be fantasy this bring out your greatest champion
you see rags his weakness was his heel but which one that was the thing that people didn't
get why yes you could call him a heel more heel than man i need we need to i need to beat out
superchase okay we've only got two and a half hours the entire chat the entire chat for a while
we're saying the cicely flag so i'm awake now give me pain and suffering i love oh no
i need to remember normal life would really change me
what the hang on hang on no no this is the cicely flag yep
is it better or worse that there's a face
you might die i'm very concerned well on this one there's like a fuck
on this one there's a bush sticking out between the legs
is that a penis i don't know it's like a wheat that's definitely a penis
you gotta like so we have to assume there's rational people behind the design of the flag
and they're like okay so three legs i don't know if we can make that and when we assume that they're
like three legs you're like okay fine yeah fine fine fine fine fine Derek fine we'll have three
legs fine Derek he's like can we have corn coming from each of the the the connections of the legs
you're like why must you why i don't know about that Derek he's like i need it i need it i want
to push on that corn it's and how the face doesn't seem well okay so in the second picture the face
seems to be asleep but the first one seems happy what does that mean explain translate
um would you be happy if you were a fucking face connected like you could probably run
pretty fast i mean i mean it's better it's better than being a it's better than being a damn
sidewalk tile yeah good reference good reference corn growing from every um
break between your limbs so like your armpits your orifice your orifices
in fairness that star wars gill said that is wheat not corn i wouldn't know this because i said i said
wheat rags didn't say this because he's also uncultured yes i did i did say we did not know
the answer to this uh right i have it feel to be educated how does it feel to be educated feels
excellent um so because i'm an educated guy we we
super chats super chats um that's what we were gonna do before any more distractions pop up before
we get any more flags i'm gonna go a few before the new episode to make sure we call the ones
that came in after we had hit offline mode can zero says both you dumbos need to watch hardcore
henry oh my god holy shit it's so good that's in reference to meat and rags i have not seen it
myself i haven't seen it yet myself i gotta tell you dude bill bill and i watched together
man it's fucking great is it is it better than the dark knight
no it's it's a really really is it better than citizen cane
uh i mean i had more fun probably watching it than i normally do watching citizen cane
but it doesn't make it a better movie is it yeah is it better than lost jedi
oh that's not hard is it better than quinton reviews videos
that's also not hard it's just a fun stupid action film it and i don't i don't mean that
in terms of like a um a pass for for things being stupid uh it actually is if you like john wick
or that kind of stuff then watch hardcore henry uh only in that it's great action choreography
okay and it's just a a very simple very quick well done story told from a a interesting
perspective of visually really a well done film is it is it art is it kino i don't know
not really but it's a good movie what is your favorite kino of all time
the greatest kino of all time oh christ oh my god i
that's really okay i i have to go by the things that i know i suppose which is that um i mostly
watch horror films so true kino in terms of horror is how i'm going to describe it true kino
in horror is shiraishi koji um uh noroi the curse um occult kartol uh those are apex horror films
and that's kino to me which is cinema verite asian horror and what what would be the top
three no you could speak sushi you would reference for top asian horror
so shiraishi koji did um noroi the curse he also did um uh kushikaze uh on that which is
slip mouth woman don't recommend that so much but he has a bunch of cinema verite films uh
uh so again uh noroi the curse occult and cult they're spelled differently occult occult is
spelled differently in in the romaji as acord as kartol which is spelled differently in the romaji
but i i mean like if horror films i love are things like um well the void was fantastic i
think one of the best four films made is the end of the void just the void yeah okay great one
um over the top in ways but a good film overall and other things i would really recommend
i can't even decide to this day if i liked hereditary or not or if i hated it i'm i'm
with red lead meteor on that movie i just appreciated the lack of jump scares
oh well then um uh what's it called uh chunko solder chunk chunko solder no um black coats
daughter so that i've seen that unfortunately i watched it because they recommended it with
with with smiler owl a vf fame and metal commander of vf fame we called it way too early and it kind
of made it too obvious in a weird way uh we felt that it was like it was like meh because we were
like oh of course because yes fantastic one of my favorite movies of the last couple years well
yes i i would never deny that the technical of everything even including the writing everything
is great on that one um it's funny you say that you're into horror right you would say that yes
um i'm very into horror uh we should hang out more it's clearly a fuck up that uh we wouldn't
just met properly because um have you ever seen darkness falls out of curiosity um is it a film
in particular it's my favorite episode of the x-files oh well it's a movie i mentioned this in
my soma set of reviews but i actually call it it's essentially the movie that scared me the most
when i was younger number two on that list is the ring the american version and the it's not
necessarily the they're particularly well made it's literally just the fact that i was of the
perfect age to be scared by them but um i can't wait to talk about why the dark novels scared me
so much um we should watch it sometime hundred percent i haven't seen it it's it's a absolutely
it's one of if not the best scary episode of the x-files on its first season is called
darkness falls which is about um there's two episodes in the first season of the x-files that
that are almost exact rip-offs of the thing and one of them is about being stuck literally in a
in an arctic environment and one of them is about being stuck in a woodland environment
that's being surrounded by these ancient um pests in terms of the what is the what is the danger
element in in terms of darkness falls is that uh they are drawn they are drawn to the lack of
light and whenever there's no light these creatures swarm and they kill people and they're these uh
tiny glow in the dark lights and they're terrifying so it's a really really good
episode the x-files sounds kind of like the uh the library monsters in doctor who yes a little bit
oh yeah well to give you a quick thing with darkness falls i don't even i need to watch
it again honestly but um the idea is that back in the x-hundreds old-timies there was a town
there was a forest and then there was an old woman who lived alone because she was wounded
in this in this thing that that that disfigured her face okay but what are we talking about i had
to step out i'm just setting up the idea i don't watch this movie with you rag see what you think
of it um darkness falls so the idea like i said back in the day really old timey times something
hundreds back in the 80s yeah older than eight 80 hundreds that's the future but you know what i
mean uh so old oldie times there's a town there's a town all right i'm gonna miss spooky there's a
town actually wait let me let me put on spooky music for the chat while i explain this spooky
but hey put on the spooky music but also put on your sexy shoes i can't why can i put on sexy shoes
i always have all right that's a reference that's a reference smaller it's a great no i know
the reference it's the fucking nibbled off penis i couldn't tell i couldn't tell because you've been
drinking i want to make sure that you understand the reference all right i put on spooky music
i put on spook spooky music so there's a town in the 1818 whatever i can't hear the music i know
i'm sorry okay i'm going to send you the link is it on the stream yes i want to put it on this
on the link to you guys so you can experience this together so we can all you know that's true
i should put it in the watch together you're right okay i'm going to put it in the watch
shit with the watch together everybody look for the watch together link it's really high up in the
chat scrolling i have to scroll past the gigantic comment that jay left on that weird article
scrolling
if anyone has the link if you could repost it that would be fucking good
i've just fucking done that good i'm using it mauler what if this what if the spooky music's
copyright well if talking over it means that it won't get copyrighted as long as as long as there's
never a time where someone isn't talking we will be fine as long as someone's talking okay so the
second i stop talking to go and do a thing you guys are going to take over for me okay so i'm
playing right again like all right here's a spooky music okay so in this town in the 18 thingies
old old stisms there's there's a town who love their townness they're like oh we're such a good
town town is great and then there's this woman who got injured by a thing i can't remember what
it was but she wears a porcelain mask over half of no all of her face because her face is all
fucked up from being injured but because she's so sad about being like oh no no one likes me anymore
she says hey because this is old timey town and no one's ever heard of a tooth fairy she's like hey
hey kids if ever you leave a child tooth you know because losing an adult tooth is embarrassing
losing a child tooth though that's normal so if you lose a child tooth you come to me and i give
you a little coin a little coin and it's a cool little thing she gets to interact with kids and
and she gives them some money and she you know it's all great so picture town forest house and
that's where she is okay and so one day these two little kids they the house is like out of town
yeah yeah she because she you know she's ugly she or she's disfigured she doesn't want people
to see you know what's the lived next to the disfigured ugly tooth lady yes exactly so she's
she's sitting over there and she's like what do you want to do you want to try to yes uh all of the
all of the things you just said yes uh so she's she's sitting in her house like la la la and then
one day wait wait is this wait wait wait a second is this the plot of the film you want me to see
no this is the history the lore if you will of the film it doesn't spoil the film whatsoever
this is this informs the rest of the film um which i will okay you know i'm gonna do it for
e-fab movies just to see what you guys think no let's do it to deport let's do it now we'll do
it after the stream okay i'm not gonna fall asleep whatsoever so let's do it now now i'm
wide awake so this is how you wake me up so one day she's she's chilling she's knitting whatever
you do and she has a knock at the door she's like oh my goodness and she opens the door and
there's these there's these angry parents and sometimes people like hey motherfucker
what'd you do with our kids and she's like wait what it turns out two kids uh a Hansel and Gretel
if you will went to see her with the intention of trading their their their children teeth that fell
out during the night for coins they've disappeared they've disappeared she killed them obviously
what else could have happened they've disappeared and so they um they they put her on a stake
they're like this is 100 she's killed them 100 there's nothing else that could have happened
put her on a stake they rip off her porcelain mask by the way his skin very sensitive to the
sunlight and she's in pain she's like oh my goodness i wear this because it protects my
fragile skin from the sun and as they set her alight they put it to flame they're like hey
motherfucker you deserve this and she's like you know what town you know what gay town you deserve
all of the curses every one of them in fact every time a child loses their last tooth in this town
i will come to collect it and if they look at me if they look upon my disfigured face i will
fucking kill them you understand all right good okay i'm right that's very specific in the moment
while you're being consumed yes i can't remember if that's actually what she says but it's spooky
nonetheless and so she dies and she's burned and she's dead and she's all kinds of all of the
yes it's horrible she's ashes all of the ashes and the townspeople they're horrified they learn
that the children got lost in the forest they're not dead they're just like oh hey we're here
oh hi i'm sorry we we took a long we're wrong turn the path was there and you know fuck it we
you guys didn't do anything stupid while we were gone right no and and they were like oh my goodness
fuck it we we saw a bread trail it led us to a candy house and we ate the candy house and you
guys know we just didn't go the right way and so the townspeople like oh my goodness we we killed
a woman for no reason damn and then fast forward to the opening set of scenes of the movie and
there's a child a young boy who's lost his last child's tooth and he puts it under his pillow
because that's what we all do when we're younger and we're like hey mom dad give me some money so
i can buy some some stuff and and for the money and uh creepy things happen and then and that's
i've led you into literally the opening five minutes of the movie so that's oh
but this is the thing if i ever show you this movie which i kind of want to now um i don't
imagine you'll be that creeped out by it it fucking terrified me when i was nine years old
and i can't wait to make a video exactly as to why because the psychological element of creepiness
is much more effective than fucking well as a kid sleeping like the the idea of something
creeping up to you at night while you're sleeping is like oh man shit that can the whole thing is
if you look at me you die so she can do whatever she wants as long as you keep your eyes closed
and you'll be fine how creepy is that yeah that's so creepy you can do whatever she wants and
and this is the thing the the children of the town are very aware of this it's like a legend
but none of them take it that seriously and so when it happens to this guy i like i said maybe
who know i don't know i kind of want to go into it so yeah that's it that's it that's it back on
for stuff no put the creepy music on no creepy music dead no no i'm vibing out to admit we
if you put creepy music on we got to constantly talk how we can't do that
see that silence right there that was that would have been copyrighted we could do it we can make
it work we gotta i gotta respond to the copy copy super chats right and you can say say them
with this spooky music so rex what were you saying what were you saying there i was gonna do
the music thing but my thing isn't working i can't press the play button and have it play so never
mind wait jackabyte said maula hasn't seen darkness falls i might be i might have embellished some
details i'm pretty sure that's what darkness falls is i could be wrong i haven't seen darkness falls
the episode of whatever aden was talking about that would be is this the star movie you got me
to google but i i don't i have no idea because if it's any movie about it i have not seen so that's
my bad there is a movie well for all i know it is wait post it jay post it what do you post it
into the into the chat well i don't know what you're seeing do you want me to post into the
no i you've got me to google this movie before i have i i'm fairly sure like i probably might
have mentioned it before yes i think we were talking about movies and yeah i mentioned it
in my soma review is a movie that scared me more than anything it's totally tied to my age by the
way it's not necessarily the content itself it's just that this is why i technically kind of don't
want to watch it again because i know that it'll be worse than i remember it however i'll totally
watch it again hey how many super chats did we get through uh you know like the word 10 000
removed from the letter one that's that's where we're at so um all right yeah darkness falls
for those who want to check out a movie that's not probably that good that i found creepy when i was
younger there you go all right time to respond to super chats everyone is everyone ready
hell yeah great um let's take five more minutes the next 24 hour efap will be an accident
might actually yeah well i'm sure we'll make it uh uh i'm doing my part are you i'm getting
married today hi rags oh hello i'm sorry to hear that but i'm sure you'll be fine i think
we may have read that one out oh well in fairness the last person who told us they were getting
married while watching efap ended up getting divorced so we don't know really oh no really
that happened at their wedding though yeah i don't know did they get but did they get engaged
while listening probably not i'm gonna guess not so see like you can't blame yourselves all right
i'm gonna work you to marry me but first i have to jay delay the efap super chats i have to get mad
about movie on internet we don't always talk about movies we talk about you know horror movies and
how they affect us like darkness falls yeah that one no i just said just mad about movie wasn't any
kind of particular we were just mad about movie on internet and ironically i'm staring at the fact
that we're at we're at 9 47 out of 12 12 is our cap and i'm like oh god we need to speed up how
bad is that okay so um bye frags yes this is a mean goodbye and that leads us into episode 54
wow what progress we've made oh we've just we've just now reached the super chats for this stream
yes so we've found the first super chat from nine hours and 48 minutes and 15 seconds ago
oh my god stealth chat all right super massive stealth chat okay hello all my n words wolf would

if you wish um you you you casually have a free nine hours typically day-to-day right uh i mean i
mostly spend every waking second reading research uh so yes apparently quinton has released his sex doll
video what did he at least he finally found a girl that would hang out with him look we just we just
covered him can you guys really expect us to cover oh my god that's not a joke he did but
wait did he really get his himself a sex doll yeah what other choice does he have it's funny
ha ha ha ha no i'm not i'm not laughing at that no you just hate women even if they're
friends it's killing the vibe for real and you just don't know what to do
well all that can be fixed in an instant with the revolutionary six doll he still hasn't fixed his
fucking audio he still sounds like an echoey twat quinton it's not hard you've had like four videos
where you sound like a retard can you please fix it he's got this whole part in his recording
because he hasn't fixed it people keep talking about in the comment section he doesn't fix it
quinton please also i'm not watching it should be like the easy one that just makes your video
better i'm not talking about it now okay if ever we talk about his sex doll it's gonna be in a
different efap we just addressed his tlj take which was horrible you really expect us to have
two bad takes in a row i don't think so anyway you uh you massive oh wait i think i read that have
you seen nostalgia critics review of the wall see that came up before we even talked about it
i told you people would want us to hear yeah it was bad and good moving on look people who want
to hear that who've just joined just scroll back to the beginning of this stream that's all you
gotta do easy scroll back like eight hours nine ten hours actually that was a quick hour yeah
it's insane bring j lambigo and anna to cover jenny's tlj video
well i'm on board with covering covering jenny's video it's just gonna be some time you know give
it some time it took us this long to cover quinton's tlj videos so you know you just give
us just give us yeah we'll add it to the list we'll add it to the list hello guys one day when
time is right opinion on jeremy johns' star wars video have you seen this any of my panel have you
seen this video no what star wars video so jeremy johns reveals to the world something that i was
made aware of thanks to nerd rotic and geeks and gamers apparently in bob eiger's autobiography he
talks about how george lucas felt betrayed by disney yes yes and so i guess they want us to
comment on it and yeah uh it's funny that we had all of the pieces of information that would imply
such a thing and uh we never had confirmation but that's people have actually people who are who
who agree with george have been saying dude why would you put this in an autobiography this is
this is awkward you you're telling the world that george lucas felt betrayed by disney
you might want to not say that it doesn't surprise me at all it surprises me that you
wrote that in your book not that it's true he gave them the treatment they threw out of course he
feels kind of betrayed by that you just see that no one got fucking dark piano music in my
recommended smaller he gave them a he gave them a treatment that they threw out in favor of making
the last jedi how fucking pissed off were you well but that's the thing jay you're supposed to
be like you have two these corporate people who are like they put on a smile and they shake hands
and then some interview goes are you both happy and then they both go yes i am happy yes i am happy
george lucas is a no under no obligation to market these films surely he's well maybe he is a
contractual thing lucas has lucas still has a vested interest in the longevity of the characters
in the world that he ostensibly created from what i understand bob eiger probably could have
done this just as a lark just to get more attention for himself i don't know but in terms of
lucas as a creator you can understand why he would be mad if he thinks that his
his intellectual property is being mishandled it blows my mind that uh bob eiger would have said it
but uh if he's just he just wants to fuck around fair enough but he's not even left disney yet i'm
just like dude yeah he's nice he's still there like wow uh that star wars gil said she's she's
been reading that um i've not read it of course i've just been going off what people have told me i
i just i find it unbelievable but good in a way i like the idea that people are more honest about
things it's cool uh here is my chat donations you massives i'll go run a 5k solve climate change

super chat all it says is hi rags hello it also says maula have you heard of rain bot potentially
maybe do something spooky for october the only plans i have for october is playing man of madea
for with it with metal because he's coming over at that point so man of madea yes i don't know
what it man of madone i think it actually is but we're gonna call it man of madea oh i've heard of
that i've heard of that apparently it's terrible which is perfect it's gonna be spooky and terrible
which is how is it only two players no it's like loads of players unfortunately me and him will be
playing it locally and i think you're you're away on that day on you i did ask you if you're
free for halloween oh yeah i won't be around halloween it's okay we'll we'll entertain the
if up crowd to some degree i'm trusting this wonder woman i only just poured my drink because
i was fizzy the stupid bottle got just because i drop you doesn't give you the right to be fizzy
can we make a law you know what that's true you should teach that drink its place yeah
aiden she knows what's up um okay where it belongs uh nice to see aiden palette in here she's an
excellent sleep aid it's okay because they say that about me so and besides you fell asleep
during this efab so clearly we're a good sleeping exactly see it it all it all comes full circle
it's hey that star wars guild said october is where my birthday is same for me i'll be doing a
stream in approximately one two three four six days uh for my b day rags you're gonna get me a
nice birthday card that says happy birthday is that what you're gonna do i i will will wait when's
your birthday six days from my my days which in an hour in an hour will be your days as well
oh okay so in six days why does everybody i know have a have a birthday like all around the same
time dang you're telling me my whole family have this six birthdays in the in the september to
october months for my family that's only half of the birthdays i gotta keep track of the family
today is my dad's birthday tell him he's cool his birthday was two days ago
rags and and so i was like oh man and then naka's birthdays in just a few days actually
shoot god everybody's birthdays right around now yeah yeah it's the cool it's october is the best
month to be born halloween is literally the coolest time of year halloween is pretty sweet
halloween is so cool um halloween is cool yeah that ended with with them saying uh that it's a
compliment i swear i agree being born in october is cool yeah it's just pretty nice and so being a
sleep aid in october cool jj abrams is in the chat i don't i don't agree with that i don't think he
would be do you imagine because it's possible theoretically that jj abrams between his jobs
doing whatever else he sits at home and he's looking on youtube and he's like this is a stream
about some kind of weird the last jet i think i'm gonna watch it can you imagine if he was listening
to us he's like what the fuck is this shit yeah he was gonna be with garbo you know what i wouldn't
be surprised because we've seen now a lot of evidence that that these people do watch youtube
reviews they do watch that stuff so it is a real possibility i think i think it's not unreasonable
well because nerd radik talked to seth mcfarlane because he he promoted parts of um or all of of
the orville and if seth mcfarlane watches youtube to some degree then surely most people do like
even if it's only once per month like they just casually catch some and then some people are
actually watching it a lot i don't know what we're gonna say jay go ahead i can't remember
all right the moment is gone you've ruined it apologize to me i'm gonna read all of the stream
lab's ones in a row because there's six um it says this one says hi there everyone especially j
if you could give a read to this short guide i wrote i think it would be something you're into
um so this is the link i was provided i will show i shall provide it to you folk as well
i'm not sure what i'm looking at it says objective subjective spectrum of art analysis
oh i've got a bit of we i read this on my street yesterday well okay fair enough this is a short
guideline i came up with to help differentiate the types of art criticism particularly fiction
the following goes for most objective and to most subjective analysis purely objective analysis
looks at the text as is and judges it based on its own merit outside of anything else looking
for flaws in the text itself such as plot holes and inconsistencies story analysis looks at the
way the story is structured and how it's written judges the story based on existing standards of
storytelling and the story's potential are the characters well rounded and three-dimensional
is the story well paced are there proper setups and payoffs is there padding and or filler
contrivances third themes and interpretation looking beyond the text into possible meanings
that can be derived from it like the previous two it uses support and references from the text
itself but it analyzes them through a subjective lens like an existing artistic theory or a more
personal viewpoint the final personal opinion purely subjective oh sorry purely subjective
experience of the text what it meant to the individual and how much they liked or disliked
it for any number of personal reasons or preferences um i like it i do though i think
that there is a way to be objective about themes as in someone says last jedi has a theme of
learning through failure and you go learning through failure agreed what are your references
and then you cite poe and i'm like but he didn't fail and so if they've drawn uh the film to mean
that to them i'd be like that's fine however your references are flawed that's that's kind of where i
go with that does that does that how does that translate to you folks i gotcha i'm following
what you're you're putting i'm i'm i'm buying what you're selling down as you were saying all
that i was just watching this watching what what are you doing what's minecraft memes
no no we got to get through super chats don't jay how could you do this to us what are you
what are you thinking
oh
what what is happening it's a man with a red nose he's being called oh no oh jeez oh
i feel bad because i haven't got the the people can't see it as far as i'm away no they can't
uh it's not it's an effap it's a minecraft meme that you won't get because jay doesn't understand
this context to everything okay um but okay that that i'm sorry we can't talk more about
it but like i said we're up to 10 hours already we've really got to push on with this to make sure
we make it in time uh for maula rags and wolf thanks a ton for all of the hours of tism the
only thing that can get me i'm glad you enjoy your tism absolutely the only thing that can
get me through my 10 hour commutes cheers mates also any of you actually play borderlands 3
can't find a definitive answer if actually good or not for ps4 i haven't played it because it's
on the epic game store yeah i'm not buying it fuck that uh we're we're not the people
you can find an answer for uh maybe maybe a year from now someone might say something but um thank
you also just don't buy it it's on the epic stone yes um but that's part of why we don't want to see
it uh person which one are you again you're jay right sometimes sometimes we can notice jay don't
listen to his lies don't listen to his lies he's always jay wait who out of you three have seen
memento i've seen memento thank goodness aden you save me from mediocrity uh so i'm gonna write i'm
gonna take a polaroid of jay and say don't trust this man's lies he's gonna be all sad about it
when he finds out uh anyway um jj oh yeah it seems like at this reference you're in trouble
uh where are we boop boop boop boop dan harman was the retard literally screeching on a stage
about trump right i think he said something something's disparaging of trump yes i i'd have
to he also said he he also said that everyone who voted for trump was a nazi that kind of stuff
naturally embarrassing hey rags i've never met a nazi before what's uh what's the deal why do
you why nazis why i believe that in order to further propagate the success of the white race
the one true race and the one race that is greater than all other races combined multiplied by two
right um we gotta we gotta have trump there's too many numbers in here i mean yeah we gotta
make trump the president for reasons i don't know i don't know why but we gotta it's gotta
be trump that's the we gotta make the key that's the key what else would be the key to the white
victory that's gotta be trump yep it's gotta be orange orange victory you see we love white people
so much we elected an orangeman orangeman the racial issue in regards of film casting to me
is oh god where did it go uh is different in the terrible star wars sequel all good guys
are women and non-whites while all white men are evil kylo ran hux all from good movies and killed
off and humiliated there's probably white men in the rebellion you'd have to just take some
screenshots but i guess you mean all the main characters um always obviously no and no i'm
pretty sure poe's not white yeah he's like he's not yeah i i confused uh fin and poe for a second
there rose is obviously not a white man um ray ray is a white man she's just not a white man
uh luke is a white man luke is a white man but he's he's a bad man until the enderman
so he's yeah but there's still some white men on the team isn't he isn't he a bad man because
he's white man probably possibly probably blaspably can't confirm regarding holdo equals
feminist propaganda i think the argument is that holder was supposed to be but failed the smart and
calm and authoritative one compared to the supposedly tantrum throwing and hot-headed man
was there one woman in poe's mutiny i didn't ask how they identified i'm not that judgmental
and that's very considerate billy lord billy lord was in the rebellion right yeah so yeah
there was one woman in like i said this is well well do we know i she's a woman yeah that's why we
don't let me let me type in pose mutiny if we're going strictly from appearances
yeah billy lord is there okay all right i'm gonna i'm gonna send you guys this image okay
this is apparently i believe you i'm the one who said no no i know but you're not the all of the
people here you're just the one oh well i'm the most oh wait there's another there's another
wamans see that on the edge that's like half wamans no this is you know that creature could
be a woman jeez poe was really progressive yeah pose hiring divisits in this direction was half
women uh so yeah uh good on you poe good on you there are some wamans um just started reading
just started reading the lord of the rings the two towers and token legit describes
an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees in the treebeater chapter i demand that you apologize
to jay look when your ends it's a little bit different you can actually kick people and
they'll fly miles and miles when you're just a tree can't really be impenetrable unless you
you're grown in such a way that all of them connect directly all right jay sorry hey what's
maybe tree ants around what kind of what is the difference between uh a bunch of vitamin pills
and uh tree beards new friends that he just met yeah explain that they're both nutrients they're
both nutrients right that's really good did you did you make that yourself new i did i just made
that up right on the spot i love it that's pretty good i'm gonna give you i'm gonna give you seven
points you can keep them oh man oh the hits just keep coming the last one is getting longer and
longer thanks for the entertainment and detailed discussion keep it up and well
i agree too my friend that's that's a german if i've ever read it i'm gonna pull that into
wait let me see that let me let you see it yeah is it not the gym and people not count unless
they're seen is that is that what you're trying to say yes there's a lot of erasure going on here
i'm upset with you jay explain yourself um don't worry i'm gonna i'm gonna put it into google
translate myself once i figure out with my drunken hands how to do it translism translate
drunken not translism oh it says good night in a few hours
underestimates here if you look like it says good night a few hours ago that's what it said
i understand that much jim what am i supposed to do rags i type it into google and it says
jim and detected i don't know it knows that all the german detected oh no
okay okay here we go so next one is aden's a girl ew how gay yeah i'm sorry to be honest
we're exploring the big gay
next one says anime cat gills and the ones who don't a game which is also a game
next one says anime cat gills are objectively better than traps
oh i don't know how about a trap cat girl oh you fucked up everything aden how could you do this
you've you've turned the scale on its head um okay konnichiwa ragu senpai
and they follow up with saying have you tried to loader in risk of rain 2 yet
uh i have all right what do you think i'm actually it's when he said i'm actually doing
that right now um between yeah yeah i'm doing that right now he's pretty it's all right i'm
still giving him a shot but so far i like it i like it i like him kind of shitty bosses though
if you get the wandering vagrants and greater wisps as bosses then you can run into some real
trouble but other than that i really like him i like his super aggressive style he's nice and quick
greetings mauler hello awesome channel i love your work got introduced to your channel by dark souls
2 series it's weird how many people found me through that i always thought it would be tlj
but yeah uh i i put a lot of work into that one i'm glad you enjoyed it and thank you
um can you guys wish my mother dreamer a happy birthday
a dreamer her name is dreamer as in dream with an a on the end oh dreamer and it's her birthday
apparently nah we don't like women on this show no yeah happy birthday dreamer hooray
happy birthday another year down how'd you do i hope you have a good birthday yes uh hello dreamer
uh e-man gameplay says hello all my m words i like it when women give birth to men they're not
sending their best they hate star wars they're rapists and some i assume are good people this
is from dale wentland i don't um i think that's a parody of another statement that would be my
assumption i think so uh hi rags hello actually this is raw hags so raw hags hey like that chick
from your story i'd want to raw that hag no uh it says i poop with my door open and i think of you
when i do it and that's that's how and how much i hate you how much i hate you how much you hate
it sorry i read that all wrong how much they you know it's probably yeah yes i was gonna say it's
a good thing they they poop they poop with the door open and they think of how much you hate it
that's a good thing yeah well that's sweet of you to say thank you very much for thinking of me when
you poop with the door open i appreciate that it's a bit of just difference based on where the hate
is directed um i'm pooping because i hate you aden do you poop with the door open when you're
alone it makes you wonder what they do when they don't hate somebody i know exactly what's
happening we're talking about pooping oh i love pooping yeah me too well i mean you know it gets
you it gets you having it poop to make someone else angry
taking a shit to own the libs you poop to make someone angry and then as a result someone poops
because that business angry on a podcast it's it's the circle of life these are different these are
different levels of commitment yeah welcome to efap made and fell all right we're so we've got
like a million years of efap super chance to get through i'm not even kidding so the next one is
can't wait for the last of us new bard i mean sequel oh that's commenting on how the new one
isn't that that much different from the old one oh no oh we will see we will see uh if we got j
long bone and that star wars guild on we would have the ultimate looking at women party it's
better party than brown table's birthday party oh that's true in every sense of the word yeah
yeah and who knows more brown table one day brown table will we'll have him on for that
brief efap we'll try we'll invite him and we'll see what happens dear you do not hold crudges too
bad brown like i don't hold a crudges against brown table i think he's hilarious no he's fantastic
dear efap would you rather be forced to eat pineapple pizza once per day
or wet bread once per day sincerely how much pineapple pizza if i can jay once again is
wrong yeah jay fucked up that's the only reason he's here is to just be wrong it's fine because
they often put cocaine and pineapples i was about to say i will peel the pineapple off and then
eat the pizza it's fine no that goes against the spirit of the question wait i have a better um
part of this my part of the question um if i choose to have like unlimited pineapple pizza
will i gain weight because in which case i will eat all the pineapple pizza because it's my favorite
what's wrong with you x two of you fight two of you i'm so sorry this happened two of you now
i'm so sorry that the your genetics we need a mutiny of our own
me and rags will stay on our island of no pineapple mixing with pizza
you're fucking exclusionary i just want to yeah in fairness i don't really like pineapple in
general so rather not some pizza doesn't really matter a girl stole a pineapple for me once but
to be fair we have not discussed the merits of wet bread true no it's to be fair to be fair
ducks love wet bread true this is so cannot ignore no ducks aren't wet they're waterproof
how the fuck would ducks be aquaphobic they hang out in the water they're literally mauler
ducks are literally aquaphobic google what that word means fear of water that's what i assume no
it's not what that word means well then somebody fucked up naming it what does it repel water
it's true someone did fuck up naming it someone someone really fucked up naming it aquaphobic
phobic let's have a look it'd be like no it's the fear of water no apparently according to the
status the fear of water well then you fucking see full of shit what's like being the worst
person on efap again oh man wow ducks are hydrophobic well then they're not aquaphobic are they
jay kick jay hi rags hi what hydrophobic means
tending to fail to mix with water so if you if you you can argue that for anything to a degree
you know what actually actually you know what you could say that that ducks are hydrophobic in that
way that um they're uh feathers yeah but yeah we don't disagree with you know hydrophobic we
disagree with like water off the ducks back yeah we we like i like mean rags we're having an issue
with aquaphobic not hydrophobic okay yeah also i'd like to point out that in one of my jobs before
i worked on the internet i literally worked with ducks there you go so i think i know if i think i
know a thing or two about uh what about penis i love i'd love penis i'd i don't see how it's
relevant but it could be reminded i guess duck penises are then you work with there i i didn't
i think creepy like a stick with loads of barbs on it or something is that i always
duck penises are like corkscrews they're like a gun that shoots bullets
we've got an hour and a half before we run out of our time this is not gonna happen you can just
be fair we've done like four super
unironically we're gonna get as far as we can a half ago we said oh no we got a
we will get as far as we can and i will fucking start another episode i will i'll do it and we
will just it'll just be super chat well i'm so sorry it'll go into the lore as the super chat
episode all right here we go two questions rags why do you have a second channel
uh i have a second channel for the so that i can do quick stuff that i want to just comment on
without having to make like big channel videos on it that take a long time to me realize i can't
say that about my second channel right i make it for quick stuff like what do you mean
i don't know just get some quick stuff out of the way
the the second question whichever and if anyone didn't know it's dog bites
yes is my second channel with a y
google youtube search dog bites with a y and you will find rags ranting about
things that deserve to be rented not the actual phrase dog bites with a y it's like spell it
with dog do g b y t e s there that is the answers of the question i like beans
second question can can a grandparent love adopted orphans yes but it only counts as half love
it's 50 love and it ends with also high rags hello all right next question
massives invite jeremy johns his recent video indicates he regrets being a tfa apologist it's
honestly heartbreaking i will try i'm going to put a note in there i'm going to say invite
jeremy johns there's no way it'll happen but i will try toxic jeremy officially jeremy johns
constant let's get enough i'll remember what that means jimmy jimmy johns the next one says
only lifetime net taxpayers should vote hi rags hello all right and i don't agree
lifetime i mean the idea of who deserves to vote is probably a very complicated topic for everybody
legal citizens well well well i think only people who've played soma are allowed to vote
i understand why people think that but i don't believe that you should have so much money or
it only those who make enough money to vote should get to basically um if you're looking
at kind of a um well a lot of people have a sort of a um starship troopers mentality to this
so that like well you know service guarantees citizenship but then also you can have ways to
buy into it as well is i think what a lot of people talk about when they talk about i think
only billionaires should vote obviously they're billionaires so they like must be i don't know man
like smarter or something i think only martians should vote yeah in the christian marsh the
martian christian theocracy uh next next one says i'm totally here for the whole thing
more less stressed i that's james moore james moore are you still in the chat did you make it
to ten and a half hours oh we'll see we'll see if he made it i don't think so i think that this is
a little bit ridiculous and that some people not going to name names but some people fell asleep
during this um i'm sorry why are you saying sorry i'm not talking about anyone particular i'm just
why wouldn't you think that we were talking about you yeah why is this i don't understand
why that would be the case oh my god james moore is still here it's a natural just respond sometimes
james moore high five uh i'm still here i'm still here and you haven't said you didn't give me a high
oh sorry sorry j high five oh thank you there we go sort of actual actual piece of shit
finally i've made it to a live one on time have seen filmentos the thanos rat problem he gives
all of the wrong reasons for why end game is bad i'm writing a video deconstructing it put
motivation is a bitch and high rags hello yeah motivation can be a bit of an issue but you've
got to keep your eyes on finished product keep thinking about what it's going to be when you're
done and how great you'll feel once all of your stuff is presented and laid out and finalized
that's true femento makes a lot of weird videos you know what he said about um he was comparing
captain saying do you know what he said about what he was comparing captain marvel to wonder
woman saying wonder woman worked and captain marvel didn't which like i mean neither of the
guests yeah but go on but uh you he said um captain marvel wasn't memorable um but why was this
it's not like it had any big problems it achieved everything it was trying to what oh no oh okay
that's what he said about that film okay well i guess it depends on what were you trying to do
what does he make a shit film then great job you did what you were trying to do he's not wrong
there yeah jay what the fuck and that's it he doesn't qualify it either he's just like no
captain marvel doesn't have problems it's fine it's just not memorable that's the only problem
it has okay well all right i might be misquoting him there but like that's that's how i remember it
um well uh people have said to cover femento maybe one day it just we need a particularly
tismy take it was the same as the closer look and the same as
no we haven't surely didn't you do the um why avengers age of ultron works no no that's in our
backlog we've not not yet no we haven't done that yet see and we'll have i will need to watch age of
ultron again because it's been so i was gonna say jay you have to understand we
it took us 10 and a half hours to cover one quinton reviews video okay and we're still on
super chat yeah so can you please can you lay off the gas manage your expectation yes once upon a
time and ironically the first episode we covered more than one one video it's not possible anymore
that used to be a thing something we could do it's not something we could do anymore
we're literally going to cap out there's no way i'm reading all of these super chats before we hit
12 hours it's not gonna happen do you understand do you understand my parents are gonna wake up
before the stream ends yes and that's good and they'll think you're being productive for once
but i'm always productive as as for femento we will cover him one day perhaps i know a lot of
people might be like why did you cover quinton we all know he's tism it's like we never covered
this video this video is really funny because it's funny quinton's a mascot okay he's a mascot
of efap we love quinton we can't wait for him to guest he never will but it was important that
we kept with him okay i'm i'm gonna drink more alcohol now since brown table made that um
fat preference do you think he cute he'll come on did he make a fat preference okay have you not
everybody wait not everybody seven people in chat no more than seven ask in a friendly manner on
twitter brown to organize amongst yourselves which seven it should be only seven delegate
amongst yourselves only seven number seven or less yeah brown table say hey brown table
would you like to guest on efap they'd like to discuss with you uh the merits of art criticism
and and we'll see if we can get him see if we can get him i can't believe tell him we'll even
get drunk so that we're friendly in giggle we're friendly anyway rags i would love to do a drink
with brown table let's do a drink with brown table i will tie it with one half of my brain
tied by back i will argue with one brain behind my brain should we even like frame it or phrase
it as it's a debate of just just a friendly conversation yeah we have those all the time
we totally totally have them all no i know but you gotta phrase it that way because otherwise
you'll scare them away all right everybody phrase this at brown table would you like to come on
a friendly conversation pause the podcast uh to talk to rags and fringy mauler about how
friendly conversations are important i enjoy friendly conversations with mauler we want to
debate about friendly conversations being the best friendly conversations are really nice
actually yes yes yes yes anyway what do you guys think of using mathematical order of operations
as an example of objectivity through an agreed upon standard are you referring to pim das
so oh shit um we we learned it as bid mass bid mass so calm down bid mass stands for
rackets indices divide multiply add subtract that's what that stands for bid mass i never
learned that i would say anytime that you can anytime that you can take anything you find in
media and reduce it down to basic mathematical formulae uh in order to understand things at a
statistical level that's always useful so yes things like pim das can be useful as well
you say pim das like i do yeah quite what does this stand for just to clarify parentheses
wait parentheses can you type out what a parentheses is just because my i'm so drunk right
you don't know what a parentheses is parentheses is brackets what the fuck mauler because you
actually don't know what parentheses are i mean you're talking about these right
you're actually you're you're fucking pitched pitched what's pitched
you call wait you call them parentheses we call them brackets well no because there are different
things brackets and parentheses are different things so what's the type of parentheses so i
So I know what you're talking about.
Oh, they're the same thing.
No, they're not because these type of parentheses.
So I'm doing a fucking job.
Press the button to find the buttons.
There's a lot of buttons.
All right.
So these OK, so these parentheses first you have
parentheses and then you have a quotation mark.
I don't know what Americans call things.
They're all tismy.
Jay, you know this.
OK, OK, OK.
Wait, wait, these are the brackets.
Wait, so what's the difference between those and though?
You call them both.
Oh, fuck, I typed the other thing.
Wait, what's the difference between the straight
parentheses and the curved parentheses?
No, there's brackets, there's parentheses,
which are like rounded brackets.
But you have square brackets and you have curly brackets
that are also called, I think they're called braces.
Dude, I like, you see, this is why we need to talk more.
Because in my school brackets, we would never
talk parentheses.
These are braces, but I think some people
call them chevrons.
Really?
OK, so for reference, these are all
just different types of bracket.
But see, I wasn't even doing that.
No, a brace is like a weird parenthesis.
Those two that I'm talking about, we were never taught them.
We were only ever taught these and they meant brackets.
Brackets, that's it.
They just mean brackets.
What are you wrong?
I don't fucking know, do I?
I was told this, Rags.
I'm an innocent child.
Brackets are squery, right?
There's a bunch of brackets, but we call brackets the squery.
We call brackets the squery.
That's why you call them the brackets.
We call them parentheses.
And then you have the curly brackets
with the squiggles called braces.
And ironically, brackets are used to, like,
straighten your teeth or hold up your trousers.
Brags.
Are we still going through Pemdas?
Brags.
Oh, yeah, Pemdas.
Brags.
Oh, God.
Yeah, no, we'll get there.
This is why we're definitely going into another episode.
There's no way we're making it.
Brags.
Brags, I'm calling you that.
You need to call Brags now.
Brags.
Brags.
So whenever you said parentheses,
unironically, I have just gone with the flow.
I've never known what you meant by parentheses.
Oh, my God, are you serious?
Nope, never known what you've meant by parentheses.
I thought everyone knew what parentheses was.
And if you told me to guess, I would have posted that.
I would have posted fucking highlights, fucking quotations.
I never would have posted what you've posted.
That's insane.
I know.
First off, it's funny that you put quotation marks as.
Yeah, no, because it's not brackets,
it's parentheses, which I was never told.
I was never told the word parentheses.
Those are apostrophes that are together.
No, no, no, you interrupted me.
You interrupted me before I finished.
I said there are apostrophes that are smushed together
to make quotation marks.
They're also called inverted commas.
No, they're air commas because they float in the air.
Have we not highlighted how fucked the English language is
by having different people told different things at the same time?
Are these even English things?
These are simple.
Did you see Trump call an apostrophe a hyphen?
This is a disaster.
Well, I didn't vote for the man because of his grammar skills.
I voted him to keep America great.
And you know what?
Grabba doesn't come into it.
You know what he fucking is.
I don't think any man who has bad grammar
can truly keep America great.
Look, genuinely.
America is great regardless of its brackets or hyphens.
This is why.
Five out of 10.
This is why.
I think that you're a piece of shit.
How about that?
This is why.
You and your bracket shit runs.
All right, let me ask Jay.
I agree.
America is a seven out of three.
This is going to lead to a point.
This will lead to a point, I swear to God.
This will lead to a point, I swear to God.
Jay, what sounds cooler to you?
I've got a fictional creature.
It's going blah, blah, blah.
And I'm like, that.
This is going somewhere, I swear to God.
It's going blah.
It's got big tongues flapping around.
And I say, hey, Jay, we're designing this creature.
And we're going to call it the Doona-Dyne or the Doona-Dane.
Oh, yeah.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Which Jay?
Which one of those two crazy words would you go with?
Doona-Dane or Doona-Dyne?
You go with Doona-Dyne?
Yeah.
All right.
I feel like I've been defeated once Jay has said that.
No, no, no, no, no, Mahler.
Because I think the Doona-Dane sounds better.
Well, you heard my reasoning, because you've seen the video.
I said that Dane reminds you of Great Dane.
I actually, I've heard it, but I don't remember it.
I said that Dane reminds you of Great Dane,
and Dyne reminds me of dinner.
What the fuck are you eating?
Great dinner.
To be fair, if you had a monster named Great Dinner,
I'd be pretty shocked and freaked out.
I want to highlight.
What the fuck is any of this?
This is all cubapod from some guy
asking about the mathematical order of operations.
OK, thank you, Josh, everybody.
We're going to talk about pin-goss.
We're going to get through.
Bid-mass and what did you say?
Pen-doss.
Pin-goss, pin-goss, pin-goss, pin-goss, pin-goss.
How did that happen?
How did we get to pin-goss?
So British people came up with bid-mass,
and American people came up with pin-doss.
How the fuck did that happen?
P-E-M-T, because America is better.
You have to improve everything that you get.
Is that it, pin-goss?
Exponence, parentheses, exponence.
Application, division, addition, subtraction, pin-goss.
So we've agreed the brackets and parentheses
are essentially the same thing, right?
I would have to put more of your math.
I mean, in shape, they're similar.
Right, let's just move on.
So bid-mass, the next one is indices.
What does E stand for?
Exponence.
What does that mean?
Exponence, yeah.
Like the little floaty thing.
The little floaty thing.
The little floaty thing.
Yes, the little floaty thing.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, the little floaty thing.
You mean powers.
You mean to the power.
To the power.
That's what we're referring to.
The thing that comes above the thing.
I can agree with the idea that it means the floaty thing,
as long as it doesn't matter to anything else.
Yeah, to the power.
OK, we both agree on that.
So D for us means divide.
What does N mean?
I can't say that on stream.
I can't say that on stream.
N, oh, there's no N.
If you need N, but if you have N,
if you think of the N that you would like to say,
go ahead and be my guest.
No, wait, don't say the N word.
How did this happen?
My stomach hurts.
What is mad?
What if you had like a son growing up
and you told him that that was the end?
That was the end with.
We never speak of the N in bed, Toss.
Not even the N, I forgot this, M.
OK, what does the M stand for at PEMDAS?
The M stands for multiplication.
Multiplication.
Oh, so you wait, so you guys multiply before divide?
Yes.
OK, genuinely, as a student of math at once upon a time,
how the fuck do you teachers agree on this
if you're from different places in the world?
Because how often do you think teachers from our countries
just get together regularly?
Regularly rags, regularly.
Let me tell you how I deal with it.
I don't teach anybody, but low graduate level statistics.
That's how I get away with it.
Well, how often does the problem really pop up?
Did you just say you teach?
You teach here?
I was a professor, yes.
Dude, nice.
Wow, breaking the glass ceiling.
You realize all of us just, we were just dudes.
I just fucking hated math.
I liked math, I just didn't like it when it got so complicated.
I was really good at math, I just hate it so much.
I could either pick stuff up instantly or never,
no matter how hard I tried.
I will say this though, math was bad,
but chemistry I despise.
Oh, I liked chemistry.
I fucking hated chemistry.
I liked all of those different reactions and stuff.
I was like, cool, I can blow people up.
Okay, well, okay, that part of it,
like that part of chemistry, let me elaborate
just so that there's no confusion.
I really like that adding this to that
to make a thing happen, I think that's interesting.
But when you get into the bonds and ionic and covalent
and you have to map them out and you have to do this,
I really, I hate that, yeah.
I like fun chemistry, I don't like shit real chemistry.
That's racist.
Chemistry was notoriously the hardest course in my school.
Okay, wait, can I ask?
It was the only thing I failed in high school
and had to do summer school.
What do you guys think of biology?
I love biology.
I was gonna say, my favorite out of the three sciences
was biology, I love biology.
It's like it's living shit and I think it's super interesting.
Can I tell a story?
Yes.
No.
Yeah, of course.
We get through these superchats in the time limit anyway,
so who cares?
So I've told this before.
I don't know if ever.
This is gonna defeat us.
What are you, I'm looking at the about,
there's like a billion of them.
Tell your biology chemistry story.
So Mr. Kids, his name was Mr. Kids.
Not a great name, I will submit.
However, when he came in to teach us, we loved him.
He was great.
He was very down to earth.
He was teaching us the facts of life in biology.
We're also having a bit of a laugh with us.
He was great.
I've mentioned this on different streams in different ways,
but we had the first religious education teacher we had.
It's pretty cool.
And when I say pretty cool,
you'd ask her questions and she would just break.
You'd be like, wait, Noah had sex with all of his family.
Had she be like, no.
It would be funny as fuck.
But the second teacher we had,
and this is something I've told before,
this is a small story in the larger story,
but still something I'll never forget.
I was the only person,
and there's only one other person
that could attest to this right now.
But basically she said,
as an intro to religious education in year,
I want to say the year before sixth form, she said.
Fifth form?
No, sixth form.
Sixth form.
Tenth grade.
Yeah, that.
She said, is there anything you've learned in science
that can contradict religion?
And I was very peppy.
I was very peppy that age.
And I put up my hand.
I was the only person there.
And she said.
You were the only person in the room?
No, I was the only person who put up the hand.
She was like, what are you?
She was like, of course, tismy future YouTuber.
What do you think?
And I was like, all of it.
And obviously I was very naive.
I shouldn't have phrased it that way,
but she was like, oh, is that right?
And she ripped into me for a good 10 minutes.
She just walked around the classroom,
explaining how she was a bad teacher.
She explained how retarded I was and how brainwashed I was
and how I shouldn't have come to that conclusion
and how everybody.
Imagine a religious person saying that your brain.
Yeah, that is the properties of irony.
Well, she fucked me up.
I remember that day being very humiliating,
but I you could argue it's kind of what makes me so obsessed
with getting the details right.
I was just like, wow, I was because once she'd finished,
I had nothing to say.
But in fairness, I was really young.
So I'm not a huge fan of her in terms of memory.
It could've been the moment she fucked it up.
However, a part of her big speech was that Darwin,
upon his deathbed, shared with the world that he was wrong.
He had told the world that the evolutionary bullshit
was all wrong.
He said, I was stupid.
I had to shut up.
I'm telling the story.
I mean, this is providing me with like,
Pirates of the Caribbean.
Do you remember that bit where he says,
I'm telling the story?
That's me right now.
So she said, he fucked up.
He was lying slash didn't know the truth.
And he told everybody on his deathbed, fuck it.
I was full of shit.
You were all right.
God real, lol, lol, lol, I'm dead.
And she told us that.
God real, lol, lol, I'm dead.
She told us that during falling apart in this whole lesson.
And now Mr. Kearns already existed.
So we were like, wow, is this true?
Who better to ask than our biology teacher?
And so we had a lesson with him literally the next session.
So we were like, I'm pretty sure it was me.
It could have been someone else.
He was like, Mr. Kearns,
is it true that Charles Darwin said on his deathbed
that all of his theories were wrong
and that he was full of shit
when it comes to evolutionary theory
and that our religion education teacher was right
that we shouldn't have taken it seriously whatsoever.
And he looked at us.
I still remember the face.
He was just like, where the fuck did you get this from?
And we were staring at him like, what?
Isn't this true?
Go ahead.
I know, holy fuck, I had almost an identical experience.
Ah, well, like I said, I'm almost to the end.
So he got like a little bit pissed
and he was like, no, that is not what happened.
Charles Darwin was upset at the fact
that it caused so much grief,
that everybody was so upset
and debating and causing so much debate
and everybody was arguing
and that he felt perhaps on his deathbed
that maybe if he hadn't brought this up in the first place
that everybody may have been happier.
And that was apparently his take.
I don't know more detail about all of it,
but I remember being like, wow,
that's way more interesting than the idea
that he just said, no, it was all bullshit, lol, dad.
Well, yeah, people, they'd like to spin the lie
that he had a tote, he totes had a deathbed conversion
and stuff like that.
It's all, it's a bunch of fucking shit.
I have a biology teacher story as well.
Go for it.
So my biology teacher,
similar to that, but not quite.
Oh, no.
My biology teacher when maybe when I was 14
was fired from the school
because during a class,
he was not quite.
Oh, okay.
It's quite close to that.
Worse, like for him as well.
Worse than fucking murdering a student.
But worse than him,
he didn't just fucking be fucking slipped there.
He was on Facebook during class,
but he didn't realize that like his computer
was still connected to the interactive whiteboard.
So it was projecting on like the projector
and like fucking huge,
everything he was doing on his computer
to an entire class of 14 year olds
as he types to a girl,
my cock is dripping with pre-con.
Oh, no.
That happened in my school.
Well, Jay, did you confirm that his cock
was dripping with pre-con?
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, I was-
I was ready to see him go.
He fucking liked-
Oh, the gym teacher's the hottest.
Fuck.
Not the gym teacher.
It's a shit teacher, I said.
The shit teacher.
What fucking class was that?
Jesus Christ.
He taught us shit.
He taught us shit.
He always taught us to shit with the door closed.
He told us about the kinds of poop.
It was poop in your poop.
It just ate all health in general, really.
He was a fucking weird guy.
He must be a big one to teach poop.
He also, before that,
he stood in front of a class of, again,
like 13 or 14 year old students.
He was a fucking weird guy.
He was a fucking weird guy.
He was 13 or 14 year old students
and sat in front of the class.
The girls should all shave their pubic hair.
They should.
They should, though.
Wait, wait.
I was not in the context of like-
No, it was not justified by the context.
Aiden, I was the only woman here except Jay.
Should you shave your pubic hair?
Absolutely.
You should keep-
It didn't look better.
You should keep it at least groomed, right?
Brags is not groomed.
And it looks better.
It does look better.
It does look better.
I agree.
But the guy fucking-
It was a biology class about puberty.
And he was talking about pubic hair.
And he said to all the guys,
okay, it's gonna be pubic hair.
You're also gonna grow pubic hair.
Shave that, by the way.
You should definitely shave that
to a room of fucking underage girls.
No, that's the appropriate time to tell them
when it's fucking puberty class or whatever.
Wait, I have to agree with Jay.
There is a context.
You should just announce that.
There's gotta be a context.
I mean, if it's just random-
It was just random.
Okay, well, if it's just randomly,
all right, all you get that coochie nice
and smooth for me, okay?
You don't really just pick it up.
That's how it came across.
That's how it came across.
That's how it came across.
It wasn't as weird for the other one.
It wasn't as weird for that one,
and it was-
My story was about-
I remember the time I came across and came to the sea.
Yeah, yeah.
Real hard to us on that one,
but I think integral kind of being like,
hey, you know,
this shit together isn't a bad idea.
I'm sorry.
Hey, do you see this shit?
The dragon is so confused.
Oh, this is a stream that kills me.
We're nearly at the cap for YouTube streaming.
To be fair, we made it to like five super chat.
It's memes like this
that immediately send my brain to a universe
where all flags are personified,
and the dragon is just like, why though?
Even though the three legged flag is trying to attack him,
he's like, but why?
Why is it a three legged flag?
Why would it attack me?
Why?
He's sweating thinking about it.
It's so fucking creepy too.
It's like some crazy silent hill monster.
It's just three legs in a fucking triangle
that's just rolling its way towards you.
I don't know what the fuck this thing's capable of.
Do you think that, thanks to this stream,
they will reinvent the flag?
They'll be like, okay, yeah, guys.
I hope so.
You fucked up.
It would be nice to die knowing I did something.
No, no, no, man's flag's called shit.
Is anyone watching from the Isle of Man, please?
Anyone in chat from the Isle of Man.
Apparently, my audience is majority American,
so we can assume that at least one person maybe, one person.
Person who is listening right now in the Isle of Man,
like, oh, they probably wouldn't care if I said me.
Say me.
Everyone's just going to say it now.
Yeah, I know.
I know, but if everyone says it,
it's probably one that's right.
Say me and then explain your coat of arms.
Yeah, it's awesome.
It is something.
You have to explain that.
Do you think the leg creature has genitalia rather than it?
The leg creature.
Sick.
It's got, like, dicks that stick out, like, pinwheels on either side.
They try and hide themselves as brushes of fruit.
They've covered in armor.
What do you think those limbs really are underneath of it?
Are you suggesting that it's a dick monster?
Yes.
It's just three dicks.
Joseph Ippolito suggests that he is of a Sicilian ancestry, so yes.
We've got a me, me, me two, not me.
Yeah.
This is a couple of people.
All of a sudden, all the Isle of Manians.
It's probably like one.
It's got to be one.
This is going to be one guy.
No.
Yeah, Isle of Man has this population of, like, three.
Unironically, there is a guy.
They're not all.
They surely can't be all here.
There's one guy.
One guy.
But they can't be.
Who has grown up his whole life,
looking at that flag and thinking this is nonsense.
And he finally found this podcast and he was like,
fucking, they acknowledge it.
Finally acknowledge.
It's fucking great stream.
We've got one hour to get through a billion hours of super chat.
So you guys ready for this?
It's not going to happen.
The super chat is more like, okay, the super chats are coming in faster
than we've been responding to them.
That means people obviously agree with what we're saying.
Do you see that Rex?
Is this a real thing?
Is this an enemy in some game that there's three legs?
Oh my God.
If anyone, if anyone in the chat is a dev,
please, please make this happen.
Dark Souls style.
I could guarantee it will get an effect.
In reference to the whole Welsh language thing,
that is the longest, like weird in Wales.
And then that's how to pronounce it below it.
I want you, one of you three,
I think rags would be the best choice.
Oh, oh, right.
Oh, fuck.
Let's do once.
Let's alternate syllables.
Okay.
Lan.
No.
You fucked it up already.
Wait, I want to test.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
So Jay fucked up.
How do you pronounce that first word?
Jay fucked up.
Rags go.
Lan.
Wrong.
Aiden go.
This is Lan.
I know, but keep going.
Aiden go.
No.
So.
Get far asleep.
This, this word, Lan, spell L L A N in the Welsh language,
when you put two L's together, it makes this sound.
So it's, it's Lanan.
It's.
How many times have I told you this?
The Welsh language is embarrassing.
I'm going to teach me this shit.
But this is the problem.
You'd be like, Moeller, translate to rags how to pronounce L L A N in Welsh.
I'd be like, shlan.
You'd be like, write that.
I'd be like, um, shlan.
I don't know how to do that.
It's a stupid invented Welsh thing.
You're just making shit out.
I know.
The Welsh language sounds fucking stupid.
You sound like you're saying a bunch of words.
They don't even sound like they fucking fit together.
It's a fucking bunch of notes.
That's what it is.
What's the, what's the clip of the weatherman saying this word?
Is there one?
Yeah, there is.
Well, there's gotta be a weather report.
How can you be sure of this rags?
How do you know they have weather back there?
I'll put it in the watch together.
Even weather is too embarrassing over the Welsh.
It's just like sunny all day.
Okay, fine.
There's like, there's going to be weather everywhere all day except for the Welsh place.
Okay, let's just do it.
You ready?
Now today we had a big contrast in temperature across the UK.
Just 12 degrees over coastal parts of Eastern England with cloudy skies,
but in the sunshine in Northwest Wales at RAF Mona,
just up the road from plan by the push wing to go get it.
I can't even take it seriously as a Welshman.
It's so stupid.
I have to pronounce it like a bazillion fucking...
Hang on, hang on.
There is a quadruple L in that, in that name.
There was just four consecutive Ls.
There are, oh my god.
There are five consecutive Ls.
All right, I'm going to play this again.
Okay.
21 Celsius at 70 in Fahrenheit.
Did you catch that?
Did you catch that?
A sentence, not a word, right?
You racist.
This is so, this is so significant.
CNN did a report on it.
Because it's funny.
It's too fucking funny.
That's why.
International news.
But the name is a sentence, essentially.
Is it?
Is it not just a name?
No, no, no, it is.
And today we had a big contrast in temperature across the UK,
just 12 degrees over coastal parts of eastern England
with cloudy skies, but in the sunshine in Northwest Wales at RAF Mona,
just up the road from plan by the push wing to go get it.
The temperature got to...
Okay, I want to, Rags, fuck.
I really hope this exists before I show you it.
Give me one second, okay?
Just carry on amongst yourselves.
How are you showing up something?
Yeah, I was about to say, how can you show me that doesn't exist?
It does exist.
What I mean is that someone put it on YouTube.
That's my actual exists criteria.
It's the funniest fucking thing.
I'm assuming none of...
Do any of you know who Dawn French is?
No.
She's a comedian, and she's one of the funniest fucking female comedians
that ever existed.
And she made a parody of Lord of the Rings.
It's going to be so hard to find this.
But I don't want to spoil the joke,
but I feel like I have to because it probably isn't findable.
Basically, she's got a little sketch comedy
where she makes fun of Lord of the Rings in different portions.
She's with Gandalf, and she picks up the ring
after it's gotten fire on it to reveal the writing around the ring,
and she reads it, and it comes out as that fucking location.
It's just hilarious, okay?
I can't make up for how it is not for...
As a Welsh person, it's perfect.
I can understand how that is very funny.
Yes.
And see, most people wouldn't just...
They just choose to not believe it's even real,
and I wouldn't necessarily blame them for that because...
Look at how it looks so dumb written.
It looks dumber written that it sounds...
My assumption is they did it just to break a record.
There can't be any other reason.
They did it so that no one would invade the place
because who wants to live in a place
where you might get the flag of the flag of Lugan
or the flag of Gogog?
The one that's really long.
That's what they call it.
The one that's really long.
Long place bad.
Long place is bad.
All right, so we did it, okay?
We covered that. That's done.
On to the sixth Super Chat.
Yeah, because that's where we're at.
All right, here we are.
Hang on, is this still from the Super Chat about...
No, this is this episode.
We're still in this episode.
No, no, but this is all from the Super Chat
about order of operations, right?
This is the one...
PEMDAS
Yes, this is the order.
Oh, shit, we haven't finished that yet.
I think we agree on the rest of it.
Fucking hell.
We haven't finished the Super Chat.
So we got to divide...
What was the M?
We got past the N word.
Not divide, multiply.
So we say add.
What do you say for O?
Okay, so parentheses, exponents,
multiplication, division.
Addition, subtraction.
I thought you said PEMDAS, not PEMDAS.
PEMDAS.
Okay, fine, fine, fine, we agree.
PEMDAS.
PEMDAS.
Yeah, PEMDAS is good.
We agree on most of it, and that's all it matters.
I don't mean...
I do not mean to derail us.
But I want to address, there's another person
on this universe who felt like an alien
when this happened.
In my maths class, when we were first...
And I say maths, because in Britain we say maths
instead of math.
In my maths class...
What do you mean no?
I don't know how I feel about that.
I don't know how I feel about that.
You didn't call it maths in...
I grew up in Germany.
Oh.
Well, they invaded a bunch of places,
so we can't trust them.
It doesn't matter.
The point is, me and this person,
we're just having a good day.
We're having a good day of chilling,
talking about things.
Everything is going great.
And the lesson for the day was,
whatever you want to invent, it doesn't matter.
It's not the point.
And someone in our class called Tom,
I still remember the person,
I'll just say their first name, Tom.
He was like,
don't you guys think it's strange
that the Simpsons,
the simp-sons,
isn't it strange that we all
don't pronounce the P?
We all say simp-sons.
We don't say simp-sons.
And we were all sitting there like,
what?
And then the teacher was like,
oh, yes.
How odd.
We only pronounce the simp-sons.
We don't really count the P.
Simp-sons.
And we were sitting there like,
but you do.
Simp-sons.
We'd be saying simp-sons,
if you didn't pronounce the P.
And they were like, nope.
Nope.
We don't pronounce the P.
Simp-sons.
How strange is that?
And me and this friend,
who is still alive,
still applicable to the day,
still assaultable.
I don't know why that was a thought.
But he's still findable
and talked toable today.
We referenced it like,
several years from now.
He talked toable.
We never understood it.
We were like,
we were the only two people,
this class of 30 people,
who understood that the P in simp-sons
was pronounced.
Everyone else was like,
oh my god, how strange.
The P in simp-sons isn't pronounced.
The P is silent.
It's like, you don't say simpsons though.
You say simpsons.
And they were like,
wow, you guys really don't get it,
do you?
And we were like...
No!
It's not silent if I can hear it.
And people were saying that I need to sleep,
that I'm drunk.
No, this actually happened.
I'm referencing because it was
in the maths class that we had.
We were blown away.
We felt like aliens.
We were like, I don't understand.
It's a P.
You say simp.
You don't say simp.
I don't...
These things happen.
smaller, maybe the teacher
was fucking with you.
The whole class were fucking with
the agreed beforehand.
You're yelling on it too.
Have any of you three
ever had a moment like that
where you felt like an alien?
My psych class did that on purpose once.
They did...
Your sight.
Your rate.
Who needs help with that?
People were saying I'm drunk.
They said it.
I would give you a guided...
You know if this was Harry Potter world,
I would cry and give you my tear
to look into a fountain of things.
I don't know how it works.
This is my tear.
Now, Sharon, my misery
that you have created.
This is your penance.
Yes.
What was I just about to say?
I was...
I feel like I was about to tell you...
You were going to criticize me
even though my memory is genuine.
No, no, that wasn't what I was going to do.
I would never criticize you.
That's never happened.
People are saying I'm drunk.
It's not...
You are drunk.
I am drunk,
but that doesn't change the truth.
It's not Simpsons.
It's Simpsons.
God fucking damn it.
It's Simpsons.
I just said it without the P.
I said Simpsons.
That's with the P.
Simpsons.
You just said Simpsons.
I say it with...
I don't pronounce the P.
I just say Simpsons.
No.
Simpsons.
Simpsons.
Yeah, that's what he did.
That one was without the P.
I agree with that one.
The difference is
Simpsons and Simpsons.
It's there, but it's quiet.
I don't care if it's quiet.
It's still there.
Singsons.
Singsons.
Okay, you've taken it a bit further than I watched.
We are the Simpsons?
Thank you.
Come again.
That's racist, by the way.
You can't say thank you.
Come again anymore.
That's racist.
Thank you.
Come again.
They are white.
They were raised in the streets of New Delhi.
It was so fucked up.
Not what fucker?
Before, I even got to counter-argue that.
Whoever made...
I think it was Jay Longbone and several others have made videos on it.
Apu was one of the most respectable and intelligent members of the Springfield community.
Oh, yeah.
And it was like, it's racist that it's like, but he was like the fucking...
It's racist that he has an accent because it's where he's from.
Yeah, it's ridiculous.
But like, what if a person from India was to say, hey, I love my beer and I love my gurn.
I'm going to sit on my sofa and collect unemployment.
Is that racist or is that not?
Rags, tell me.
No, because they're white.
It's not racist.
Damn.
No, it's crazy what the rules are, whatever they are.
Someone in the chat said he has a hot wife.
He does so.
She's very attractive for Simpson's standards.
For a 2D person...
For a brown person, is that what you're talking about?
No, I said for Simpson's standards, that could mean a lot of things.
Oh, that's fair enough.
Yeah.
2D beats 3D, I'd say.
Brown is better than like...
2T pooty po pooty.
It is literally yellow.
Brown is the new black.
That hits too close to the chest, more or less.
Screw you.
What are you referencing?
What's for that?
You know, that was a joke about a show because the show...
There's a show going on right now called Orange is the New Black.
No, it's not.
Is that trying to see that Trump is discriminated upon like black people were?
No.
Orange is the new black.
Can you imagine what's the point of the show?
It is the new black.
Leave Trump alone.
Orange is the new black.
That would be fucking amazing.
I kind of want to...
There might be a show on TV called Orange is the New Black.
But in my apartment, Kevin's the new black.
Kevin Hart?
He's black.
How could you say that?
Yeah.
You're referencing Kevin from Home Alone?
Kevin from...
You know what?
Never mind.
Forget it.
Just never mind.
Have you seen The Upside?
I don't know.
What are you trying to say, Jay?
The Upside to Life is not black?
What the fuck?
Have you seen...
It's a film with Kevin Hart in it.
Have you seen it?
No, I've not seen it.
That's a good film.
You should watch it.
I was going to say, since we're 11 hours and 10 minutes and there's no fucking way
we'll make it through the next set of eFap Super Chats by then, we'll take the break
here to make sure that it's a nice and chunky next episode, okay?
So I'm going to end stream now and then I'm going to start a new one immediately to read
out the rest of these Super Chats.
Is that all right?
Sounds pretty good.
All right.
I'm not hearing any disparaging comments in relation to it.
I mean, I mean...
That was disparaging, but I'm going to ignore it.
You disagree?
What?
See, that's not a disagreement.
That's just a question of what I even said.
No, what was...
No, what was...
What did you just said?
I said, I'm going to end the stream now and start a new one so that we have plenty of
time to answer these Super Chats instead of restricting ourselves to 50 seconds minutes.
We're never going to leave, Mauler.
We'll come back.
This is where we...
This is where we die.
That's fine.
Here in this chair.
Episode 55 is the Super Chats episode.
That's all it is.
The Super Chats episode.
Imagine you're Dusty Smith scrolling through YouTube and you see that Efep has a multiple-hour
stream devoted just to answering.
That's rude.
You can't...
That poor man.
How could you say that, Rags?
Oh, my goodness.
Okay.
I'm ending it.
Poor man.
Okay.
Everyone?
Everyone?
Rags?
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
And wait, I want to...
In case Aiden is unavailable for the next one.
Aiden, would you like to promote your channel at the end of this insane stream?
Yeah, sure.
Go for it.
I'm going to post it in chat while you talk about it.
For those who made it this far, you have now earned the right to promote yourself.
Yeah, after all, I took a nap.
Even I couldn't sit through it.
It was okay.
If you were more capable of staying awake than I was...
How do you promote yourself?
Yeah, my channel is mostly an intersection of politics and current news stuff and how
it intersects with current research in social psychology and the social sciences.
It's a lot of statistics, a lot of heavy research, but also I try to make it fun and
do mean shit.
Basically trying to provide a very analytical, scientific explanation to complicated social
topics.
That's about what I do.
The end.
Look, the easy way to argue it is she's done a video all about how Quentin has issues of
a certain kind.
I'm not saying all of the issues, just a certain kind of them.
And that if you look at that one first, just search Aiden Paladin and Quentin, you jump
to that video, you watch it and then you're like, okay, now I want to watch more from
Aiden Paladin.
That's the easy intro.
Just jump to that one first.
You'll find it fun.
You'll learn some stuff that you'll be like, why the hell did she come on this podcast?
And that's going to be the eternal question that never gets answered.
Jay, would you like to promote your channel?
Jay, stop talking.
Rags, would you like to promote your channel?
I would love to promote my channel.
My channel is Rags.
You should probably promote Dog Bites in case anyone's ever heard of it.
And also, if you didn't get enough there, which is possible, though unlikely, if you
could manage to make it through all that, I also have a second channel just for off-the-cuff
stuff, just a smaller one called Dog Bites, D-O-G-B-Y-T-E-S, but Rags is obviously my
real name.
I mean, my real channel name, even though both are true, because I got to keep with
the lore.
Is that it?
Are we done?
There's nothing else to say, right?
There's no Jay here, right?
Jay, promote your second channel.
Jay 2.
I have a stream archive channel, which has got like, it's got you on it quite a lot,
actually.
That's a lie.
No, it's not.
Is it called Jaxi, Lord of Jaxi?
Is that what it is?
It's called Jaxi, Lord of Milk, which is an eFap meme.
Is it really?
I like it when your videos go out and I check the top comments, and so many of them are
Jay eFap memes.
That makes me happy.
I'm like...
That's...
It's one...
Lord of Milk was one of the more difficult Dark Souls bosses.
Yes.
He'll catch you off guard.
Every time you get into 1% health, he turns into milk, and he goes down your throat, and
it's this whole thing.
He just...
He just becomes a strong skeleton boner.
Skeleton boner?
The penis is meat.
It needs blood to become hard, Rags.
How does that work if you're a skeleton?
It's just a boner.
Alright, I'm going to end it there, and we'll be back in...
Did you just say the penis needs blood?
Yes, it does.
Don't lie to me.
It does.
It does.
Imagine you entered into a temple, an ancient temple, and it crossed the top of an ancient
temple.
What?
I can't...
Okay, I'm ending it.
We'll be back in between 5 and 10 minutes.
Thank you for watching AFAP2054.
We'll be back.
Oh my god.
