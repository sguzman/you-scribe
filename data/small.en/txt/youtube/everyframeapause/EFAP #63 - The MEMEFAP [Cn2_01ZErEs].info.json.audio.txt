Not before.
Being alive sounds like something a racist would do.
I knew it.
Are you saying that we need more dead racists?
More dead racists.
Wouldn't we lose half the left wing at that point?
Damn it.
The left wing, we have the right.
Everyone knows they're all a bunch of racists.
Mm-hmm.
You look jab alone.
I think you lose a fair amount of a lot of ideologies.
It's ideologies idiot.
No, all the racists are specifically on the one side that isn't me.
That isn't me.
Look, this is me side.
This is me.
Side me.
Double whammy back-to-back efap.
Yes.
We have some memes to shleem.
What memes?
We have a big stream.
We're gonna go over all the memes.
We're gonna laugh.
We're gonna cry together as a family because that's what this meme stream is all about.
It's family.
It's about family and that's what's so powerful about it.
Mm-hmm.
Formalore.
Sure.
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, how's everyone doing?
You're all right?
Doing all right.
Doing doing pretty okey-dokes.
I mean, almost for my first drink.
We didn't we didn't really talk about how bad it is, but Spooktober is over.
Like, Spooktober is a shit Spooktober.
I moved to make this November a sequel to Spooktober.
It's no not November, which is kind of spooky.
The thing is, it'll start to bleed into, you know, Christmas-tober and we can't remember.
No, not Christmas.
Also means I am back home now.
Nude.
Which means you'll be streaming again.
That is true.
We got so much done while you were here.
We drank.
And watch movies.
Um, do we do we mention drinking already?
No, no, I think we should probably.
Oh, we had some drinks.
Yeah, and and and so many things so many things are all rearing to come out.
Batwoman episode 5 is coming out any any time now as in the actual episode.
We haven't seen it yet.
Yeah, obviously very excited about that.
I anticipated more than I anticipated episode 6 of Game of Thrones.
So season 8.
Oh my goodness.
Moira and Mel no longer sleeping in the same bad cry phase.
Yeah, we got us a meme stream with a meme cast, which means all the people here are basically like, they're so silly.
They're barely human.
Why watch your stream for peace?
I'm gonna stream tomorrow again.
I'm sorry.
I thought we would start this earlier.
Yeah, you could have streamed today.
What the fuck?
Idiot.
Yeah, you could have.
Why didn't you?
Because I thought I had an appointment at 8 o'clock.
With who?
Why would anyone who did this?
That's my answer.
It sounded a bit like peeing.
TLJ is in the critically acclaimed films category on Netflix.
Well, it was critically acclaimed.
My point was immediately gonna be, why does anyone care what Netflix thinks about a list called critically acclaimed films?
Like, that's just...
Netflix is making two seasons of another life.
See, Netflix can't be trusted.
They really can't.
Not after they canceled Daredevil.
Well, they canceled Daredevil.
They keep Batwoman and another life going.
That seems like, that seems right to me.
Obviously, it wouldn't be if we weren't in Clan World, but that's where we're at.
So, stop complaining, guys.
Geez.
Besides, we still have Batwoman.
That's what's important.
Yeah.
It's about Batwoman, and that's what makes it really special.
I'm a Batwoman.
Batwoman's great.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the show we needed.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the one we got.
Batwoman was sent down to punish us for our sins.
So, as a continuation from the previous stream, I have been made aware of the Reddit thread
regarding that Star Wars girl and Batwoman.
Which Star Wars girl?
That Star Wars girl.
That one.
So, we can have a gander at this.
It is titled,
This has to be the worst review I've ever seen.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
Is that what Anna looks like?
Is that her?
Yeah, that's Anna.
Oh, okay.
I just like the comment.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
So, why is this in the Batwoman subreddit?
Is it because she's reviewing Batwoman?
Yes.
So, to see her review is Batwoman review.
What the hell is CW thinking?
Which is a fair...
So, the defenders of Batwoman on the Batwoman subreddit.
They're upset that that...
What a strange thing to say.
They're upset that that Star Wars girl is negatively reviewing Batwoman.
Yes.
I'm sorry, you need to have a high understanding of literature to understand that.
But yeah, just to, you know, add to it.
She comes off as homophobic.
That's interesting.
Along with all that, she clearly didn't actually watch the show.
At most, she read a brief summary.
Oh, she's like Jenny Nicholson then.
Well, sorry.
I think that a brief summary of the episode.
That's what a show...
Each show is a brief summary stretched out into an episode.
Yeah.
They don't flesh things out.
Things just happen.
People really go out of their way to bring the show down.
You do not have to go out of your own way.
You just need to watch the episode if that was brought down.
Well, that's what going out of your way is.
If you watch it, it wasn't made for you.
So, you're going out of your way to watch something you know is terrible.
You're like, I watched the episode.
I didn't think it was good.
So, I was like, why would you go out of your own way?
Yeah.
Why would you go out of your own way as if that's even possible as a concept to go out of your own way?
I think kind of watching that woman counts as going out of your way.
Did you miss the past two minutes of conversation?
Quite possibly.
I wasn't focusing on it.
B ad rags been making jokes about that for ages that you just cut it.
I was looking through the thread.
I will admit, I was looking through the thread and reading what was on it.
And then thought, I'll enter back into the conversation now.
The jib inside your head has clearly fallen out of his wheel.
The jib in your head.
Your head jib is confused right now.
He's trying to file everything.
See, I'm curious about what she has to say.
So, I jumped around a spot.
She's really bitching about how Batman didn't save Kate's family.
I'm sorry.
That's so integral to the whole thing.
It's what everything is based on.
But yeah.
Did she tune out at the part where Batman thought he secured the car so he
could save the busload of children?
So, is that what he did?
Well, this is the thing when we were watching it.
That was the best faith interpretation I had.
But the contention for everyone is, wow, Batman fucked that up.
He fucked up like the what his grappling hook could hold.
That seems like Batman.
Just a real simple thing.
But then when that woman throws a batarang and it misses, that's the
batarang's fault.
That's the batarang's fault.
Exactly.
It wasn't calibrated for me.
God, this batarang wasn't calibrated for my short woman arms.
Therefore, that is why I missed.
It wasn't because I fucked up.
What are you calibrating a fucking batarang anyways?
With science.
Oh, thank you.
I know I could come to you.
So, you got jumped to another random part.
She's bitching about why they took Sophie for whatever reason.
She clearly tuned out of the part where Jacob sees her as a better daughter
and attempted to kill her because Alice knew it would piss off Jacob.
Fine.
So in later episodes, we know that she shouldn't have anything against
Jacob, though.
That's the thing.
Well, this, yeah, so this is the rest.
There's other problems you can generate from this for sure.
But like I will admit when you watch episode one, it does seem kind of
random that they go for a fuck.
What's her name?
Ex-girlfriend person.
Yeah.
The like like she remember the whole they just plaid the thing where
she's going to fucking fall off the thing and land on like a trampoline
that they capture.
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what and then you're like, oh, so it's very
important that Alice kill her because she's, you know, going against
like Jacob.
It's like, well, she fails miserably to kill her.
She doesn't really do a good job.
And she sort of let her go in the next three episodes.
Not really kind of not really.
I mean, like, you know who this person is.
You know where they live.
And again, just highlighting how awful of a villain Alice is like Alice
is aware that the stepmother has forged documents in order to convince
everybody that Alice was dead and she blames Batwoman and Jacob for
that.
Yeah, they blame the she blames more the people for believing the lie
instead of the person who lies.
And then she wants to kill Sophie.
She is a vengeful guy.
She sees her as a daughter like, wow, all right then.
Hey, listen, maybe there will come a time in the show where Jacob kind
of gives that impression once.
I think in the first episode, he's nice to her at some point.
There you go.
Yeah, he's sort of nice to her.
I guess.
That's like a daughter like Mahler.
I just I've always wanted to say Molly you you've just like always
been a daughter to me.
Oh, I've always sensed that the daughter father relationship we
have. I really can't understand why the show gets so much hate.
I didn't know that this is really bad.
All right, if these people if these people who complain and hate it
justify their opinion that it's bad just because it's bad.
Clearly, they haven't watched the other Arovis shows.
Oh, that's yeah, that's saying other things are also shit.
That's not saying your things good.
Does that statement obviously read as they say it's bad, which is
stupid because everything else is bad.
If anything, you're just saying things are consistently shit.
This is the exact same thing the TLJ defenders say.
Oh, yeah.
Well in the original trilogy.
Okay, even if that was true, that wouldn't I was going to make
your show.
The other CW shows may very well be bad.
Why would that mean the show isn't bad?
There's more shows than just the CW shows that get goes further.
Okay.
No, there are no if you like Batwoman your universe is watching
the CW shows and Batwoman is in no way worse than them.
It's like, okay.
You know what?
I believe that considering the clips of Superwoman.
I've yeah, well, I assume Arrow is best out of all of them.
It's either Arrow or Flash.
I remember you'll talk about that.
But I know that Superwoman is garbage.
I've heard Flash is the best.
I think yeah, we wouldn't know.
We don't want to know.
We are doing the unthinkable and judging something on its own
merits.
Look at this on the contrary at the moment.
The show is fresh and new and has a better atmosphere.
Sorry has better atmosphere and stories than Arrow for example.
Oh, no, Arrow.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no.
She's just it's a new by the way fresh and new just means,
you know, woohoo.
I've definitely never seen anything like Batwoman.
That is true.
Isn't the flash on Netflix right now?
I don't know.
Is this a different flash on the flash Batwoman?
Oh, look at this.
So clearly the show gets so much hate because it's about a lesbian
woman.
Yeah.
Where is that?
There's always one down.
But if someone actually watched the show, they will see that she
doesn't disrespect Batman.
Yes, he does.
Oh, man.
It was a first of all here right now.
He would fucking flabber.
But secondly, yes, he does.
Batman.
She doesn't disrespect Batman.
No, she doesn't disrespects.
Oh, no, I thought it was Spatman.
Spatman.
I'm the Spatman.
She doesn't want to take his place or claim she's better than
him.
She literally.
Oh, this came out before this came out before that was said.
Oh, my goodness.
That's why people like this show.
That's an age.
Well,
I'm not the same Batman.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better with Batman.
This show doesn't have any agenda.
Yeah, it just tells the story.
Sorry.
It just tell the story of a superhero who happens to be a gay
woman.
I don't think that's.
Man.
That's all that's all it is.
Is it just a comment that just says watch the fap biddies?
I was about to say that.
Yeah.
Like we've got a moment where she says I'm gonna be better
than Batman and then that comment is like she's not trying
to be better than Batman.
Okay.
I'm curious if on YouTube or someplace we could get our
hands on somebody like live reviewing our minis or something
or doing a response to our minis.
Oh, do you mean like someone who disagrees with us?
Like people who disagree with our our mini our reactions to
it as we watch the show.
Now you've said that you might encourage people to do it
in like a fake way.
Let's hope that we don't be able to tell we can sniff this
sort of thing through.
Yeah, we usually vet a little bit before we just throw on
a video.
So oh, yeah, we'll be fine.
By the way, anybody who hasn't seen the Jay Longbone reviews
of the they're great.
Please do make an effort to watch them.
They're great.
Yeah, you shouldn't just watch one person's review of these
film video things because they're so terrible.
Like one person is not going to catch everything that's wrong
with them.
And I mean that I'm serious.
Like there are things that Jay Longbone says and Thorius
Unlimited say that we just don't catch we legitimately just
missed it because there's so much.
The reviews are awful and generally politically motivated.
Ours really aren't we?
I'm part of yes.
I'm part of the good show party.
Yes, we advocate for consistency in the in the eFap party.
Yeah, we refuse were politically motivated.
Wouldn't they say it was good like mainstream reviewers
politically motivated.
That's the kind of thing that they like.
Well, they were they're addressing people like Anna and
they assume Anna hates lesbians.
I guess politically something.
I don't really know.
It's not as opposed to morally.
I have a political hatred of lesbians.
It's not like stop having rights.
It's political.
I hate the lesbian party.
So I saw a bit of one of the one you show here.
She complains that things that could have been dragged out
for a whole season are resolved in first two episodes.
Some of her words repeating this idea were don't drop every
single bomb in the first episode.
You could really drag this out.
You could have dragged this out for a whole season.
Like that's a problem that the show gets to the point too
much.
What you're looking for is rush.
Yeah, the show gets to the point too much.
That's what they conclude for me say that it's almost too
well for all of a sudden we have we need to have our we
need to respect the time.
Listen, the time of the people who enjoy Batwoman.
It's very valuable.
They're doing it.
They're doing very important things.
Otherwise, all right.
I like that.
I get your point, but I think that this drama about Kate and
her family.
Most people are just confused because they haven't had a lot
of time to care yet.
Like if Darth Vader told Luke is his father 30 minutes into
a new hope it wouldn't work as well.
Yeah, it wouldn't.
That's one of our memers.
Yeah, it's just like by the way, have you ever considered
that's why that wasn't done?
Like yes, you're going to care about people.
The whole story should be five minutes.
It would get to the point better.
It would don't post these idiots and give them extra publicity
of views.
Don't challenge my thoughts as if any of these people actually
watched it.
Like any of these people actually want to watch the review.
No, it's the top the top things on the thread say I skipped
around after half.
I only skipped the two random parts like great.
Yeah, go away.
Genuine guess 60% didn't watch it.
30% watch portions 10% if we're lucky watch the video.
I think there's probably yeah, I'm being really generous.
I don't think the show is good yet, but I have watched each
episode to criticize it without completely watching the episodes
is not fair.
You can criticize episodes.
Yeah, individual episodes can absolutely be criticized and
I would be curious to the if this person could let us know
beforehand how many episodes we need to watch before we're
able to reach a conclusion just so we know when we get there.
So it's not a constant moving the goal post of oh, no, you
have to watch more.
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
If you have to watch more really not to mention it's all
like our later episodes really going to fix what happened to
the previous ones.
Like are the effects just suddenly not bad anymore in like
the previous episodes and so on.
Yeah, because it's revealed.
It was all faked by mysterious say, for example, we were
tasked with writing the rest of it.
There are fixes we could try and apply.
We could try but but you know, there's something you could
do to try and make it better.
But let's say for example, I was tasked with writing the
remaining 14 episodes.
I'd be like the season still gonna be bad overall.
There's no way I'm gonna be able to do anything about that.
It's hard to come back from some of this stuff.
What's happened happened.
We can do our best to flesh out relationships and back story.
Obviously, I'm discounting the idea of having to wake up and
go.
Whoa.
What are the crazy long dream?
Okay.
Yeah, I dreamt.
I was bad girl.
Well back to school and back to school.
Why do you give them all publicity?
You do realize that you're basically encouraging more people
to watch her video and give and given she probably makes money
from ads based on the view of using a video and the response
for the poster is I never told anyone to watch it.
Jesus Christ.
How dense can it be?
Apparently there's a crossover already between that one
and Arrow.
Yeah, there's like and what is it the the extroverse or?
The extroverts the extrovert.
The extrovert extroverts unite.
People who have no knowledge in literature have no place to
make a review reviews are supposed to be unbiased given
with knowledge.
Wow.
This is neither knowledgeable nor read like me.
I don't mind watching a review that is biased, especially if
that's the fucking point like if they're like, we're going
to be looking at this from the perspective of but if you
like, you know, this is what it is and you're clearly biased.
That's a problem.
But the idea that you can't have any bias kind of weird.
That's that's like the full opposite of Quentin's take of
like a review is just a description of an experience and
it's wrong for like the exact well, no the same reason.
It's like it can be this video is like going to the doctor
who's never been to med school.
What it's not how this works.
No, that's not that's not not a very good analogy.
A doctor who's never been to med school can still accurately
diagnose and cure you.
Yeah, you can still be an amazing doctor.
It's about level of trust and accountability.
It's not about this.
It's not about ensuring right?
Not to mention it's like it makes it sound like she's trying
to say.
Oh this person didn't spend seven years in school to learn
how to watch movies to learn how to criticize Batwoman.
I definitely did.
There's a comment that says what about people that did watch
it and didn't like it and then you got the responses that
if they can leave a valid response as to why then, you
know, that's fair enough or whatever and so we'll just respond
it with what we're reacting to Batwoman season.
What episode?
Why do you fat bit it?
There you go.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
Like the they really don't like people shitting on the show.
It makes sense.
They're a community of Batwoman.
I can't believe a community formed around that show.
That's saying that's a real thing.
I imagine it's a community that's like already just like
bleeding over from the other shows.
Maybe yeah, I like because my conclusion on a lot of this
is just like, you know, you know, like TLJ you can get a
lot of like rationalization and I'm just like so how bad
does the show have to be before it has zero fans and I
don't think it's just not possible, right?
There's always going to be someone who likes something.
Yeah, that's where we're at.
Well, that was fun.
That was great.
I agree with everything that was said.
That stars goes in chat as well.
Yeah, we found the thread.
That was a very fun read.
Keep this off.
Go for it.
It's funny.
Remember if they post about you, you're you're essentially
Um, so next up we've got the well, I was going to give you
guys a link to this, but there's no point because obviously
I'm doing it on screen, but you can play along.
I suppose make your own tears as we're doing it, but this
is supposed to be a tier list of efap villains.
Unfortunately, Jeb Nichols is not in here.
So I don't know if we can like quickly make one or something,
but we can head Canada.
Yeah, I don't actually recognize all of these icons.
I might do after we just discuss them for a little bit,
but I'm almost feeling like is this it?
Is this all the people we've covered because we need to improve
like, you know, it can't be all the people that have been
covered on efap.
I guess it's just the prominent ones.
I don't know.
Mem- most memorable.
Yeah, Jay's in there as well.
Jay or defap villain, how's that feel?
Beautiful.
So this first tier list, well, I was going to say we'll do
two and one will be tearing them for the meme ability and
the other one will be tearing them for like quality in terms
of a content creator.
And I suppose the rule will have to be overall versus the
video we covered because that's not going to apply very
easily with a lot of these people if we've covered more
than one video and also if we've watched them separately.
So and you know, we can have a look at chat, see what they
think as well.
But which one would you guys want to do first, I guess?
Well, memes, I think.
So hold on a minute.
This is this it ranks them to who's the most evil to who's
the least evil.
I suppose.
Well, so the two, do you hear anything?
I see Ally up there and now I'm confused.
Oh, ignore those.
I'm going to change them to S plus and then god-like.
I already know who's going in god-like.
Yeah, me too.
Alright, one day.
Yeah.
So it's just like I said, degree of either quality of meme
ability, which one do you want to do first?
Memes wallet.
Let's do.
Yeah, we can start off with meme ability.
Get us in the main mood.
So we'll use kind of say low tier meme ability.
Yeah, somewhere in the middle ish middle low.
He's reasonably meme-able.
I'd say C.
What really it's like we know because D is the worst right
the absolute worst, but we did get the whole I fucking hate
Trump thing out of them.
And ragged.
Oh, that was him.
Yeah, and also that's just fan stuff narrative tripling.
Was that same video?
I think he's in a at least I thought narrative tripling was
so sorry narrative tripling goes to TRO rather than him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think I think I think B.
I see your B with B was okay.
Well, I almost feel like let now the the overton window, right?
I if they were in grade school because there's not an F.
So we have to boost that up or D is the lowest we can shoot.
Maybe we can come back to him later after we after we filter in
some of the end of the list.
All right.
So I would if I'm making a vote now, I would say he's B.
So while we haven't had many memes out of him, the ones that
we do have are pretty powerful stuff and long-lasting.
I don't know.
I feel like a lot of the memes we get from him.
We don't reference all that much.
Maybe the Trump one is the most popular rags is one of the
most way.
He wasn't necessarily him, right?
That's a combo.
That's a lot of people a lot of people don't know how to
pluralize things that end in S apparently.
He shares that with TRO or it might actually go strictly
the TRO.
I'm not 100% sure on that.
But we'll like I said, we'll put it at the end of the list
and we'll figure it out as we go along.
So Patrick Willems, I'm going to drop that to begin with and
then we'll figure it out.
So Patrick Willems.
We've got I say I would say that Patrick Williams.
Well, let's see.
He is a meme.
Our space wizard meant for children thing.
I was going to say there's not a lot of memes associated with
him, is there?
Yeah, watching a lot of dumb stuff.
It's a meme himself though.
Those aren't like memes per se, not in the sense like they're
just dumb stuff.
He said it's different than memes.
I would I would argue.
I do agree that he is essentially a meme.
I do agree with that.
But what does that mean for the monster?
It's my favorite.
Yeah, but he's not a meme because he says meanie things
so much as he says stupid shit.
Yeah, that's what makes him a meme.
I don't think that like all I don't think memes are the
same quite the same like he is a he is a meme.
We say that as a meme, but he hasn't really said a lot of
stuff that I think is meanie.
But all of our all the people in the audience use second
language is English.
I'm so sorry.
You're watching movies wrong.
Yeah, that was quite a thing.
I would I was it's intended for children.
That was him original fine with B.
I'm fine with B for Patrick Willems.
I'm okay.
He was chat.
What's your favorite Patrick Willems quote?
It's going to be hardly any means.
I swear to chat.
It's your job whenever we come up with one of these to
start throwing memes at us.
We remember them.
Okay, that's that your interaction.
You'll you'll remind us you need your help so you can
throw in any note.
What are you okay?
He said that space titty aliens were his favorite addition
to Star Wars.
Say that I still think B though, I don't matter.
He's he's up against a lot of competition here.
So I think there's I think we're going to have a lot of
B AB and C tier guys.
I'm happy to leave him in B for now.
Yeah, I think B is 1.2.
Bill, you know, no, he's there.
We'll get to you.
We'll get there.
Yeah, so this is the man who made the the only one we
covered was him saying that a Infinity War equates love
with abuse.
I would honestly put him he's possibly our D like I don't
think we even mean.
Yeah, I think he's D.
We didn't get any memes from that.
I don't know.
He wrote alien colonial Marines.
Oh, he did.
Oh, how does that factor in?
Yeah, I think that puts him up to a C.
I think that that's like, you know, one mention that boost
him a little is what you might say D would just be there
are no memes based on them.
And then C is like, you know, maybe if we can have something
Is there anybody who hasn't had a meme about them?
Well, we've managed a few years.
No, no, because he said he can't you have to remember seven
people's names.
Oh, yeah, cinema wins.
This is it will wait.
Hang on.
We'll get there.
All right.
We'll leave is everyone.
Okay with C for film.
I'm C for film joy.
If anything, the fact that he wrote aliens colonial Maria,
that's quite a bit out of the bottom list, even if it's only
well, I think it should count because we did efap that game
on efap gaming.
So videos from that game.
Oh, man.
So Jay is next.
Jay, I'd say Jay is ally or S.
We got no, so I've changed it to me and we've got no ally
category.
What?
Oh, we don't know how I changed it to SS plus Godlike.
Well, there's no reason not to farm rhinos.
This is so I need to rename.
Oh, as a as I will change that to S plus.
All right, do that.
If you read it upwards, it says ass Godlike.
Nice or Godlike.
Yes.
Saba, just good.
I'm happy with honestly, my first guess would be as plus.
I think we're looking at a pretty strong name material here.
Some of the some of the strongest memes have been generated
from this creature.
Yeah, that I genuinely feel like this is an achievement.
So we have mom, he he we got good memes from him
that when we first covered him and he continues to be
a source of me amusement.
So I would say I would say he's up there.
S plus or S one of those two S plus probably I would say
that we sell the future.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
There's a lot of shit.
There's a lot Mel.
What's your take S or S plus?
Uh, actually somewhere in between actually.
Well, if we got to wait, what was yours Rex?
S plus.
So you've got two S plus is the between S plus and S
and then S that does average amount to S plus.
Yeah.
Next up, Matt job.
His whole life is kind of a meme.
His whole career is a meme.
Yeah, polder boy.
Yeah, he's he's maybe taken that step from meme hood
into case study.
I was going to say for me.
It's probably S maybe a he's he's not just an eFAT meme
though. He's like a Monday.
You met you meet.
You said Monday.
I was confused.
I like how people people in chat would have scored him low.
It's like no guys.
I kind of want to score him low too.
Well, we got we got lots of fun out of him in his video
about Game of Thrones.
Remember?
Yeah, man.
People are all over the place about Matt Gebro.
I I think because it's every it's really all over the place.
I'm fine with I'll put him at a for Matt.
I do want to clarify.
Is this just how many eFAT memes there are like how memeable
they are just like for the world?
Because he's got like he's memed a lot outside of eFAT.
Yeah, that's true.
I would say in general.
Well, let's just let's just compare the right.
So if it was eFAT only he probably scores like a B, right?
Yeah, probably.
I don't think he said that.
But if we can't if we count them as a whole which I did say
we kind of have to do sort of because the problem is that then
he wouldn't be any fat fella.
This is very skewed if we don't count them with other stuff
because we're fully a lot of these people have a lot of
backstory we're aware of.
I don't think he's as high as Patrick.
And when eFAT runs we are talking about these people with
knowledge of their backstory.
It's not like eFAT ignores mundane Matt's history.
We made bolder jokes all the time.
That is that is true.
So A around around an A.
Yeah, I think he's more meme-y than Patrick Willems.
So this is an interesting one.
Cinema sins.
I don't actually know.
Probably a D.
I don't know any memes about cinema sins to be honest.
But we haven't really had any memes out of him.
So I'd say just D plus he's not I don't know if he tries to
be meme-y or if he's just chat.
Are there any good cinema sins eFAT memes as cinema since ever
been memed on eFAT not that I can recall.
I have no memory.
Yeah.
It's going D D D F D D F D D D F because I think a lot of
people that we cover talk about cinema sins, but we'd never
really talk about cinema sins.
Give him to D.
I'm not seeing a single meme yet like oh the plank.
That was funny.
The plank was good, but I don't think it was a random plank
in the forest.
At least this is a pirate plank.
That was that was funny.
Yeah, he's still D.
He doesn't get it.
He doesn't get it was the it was the blade from the helicopter.
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, I'm happy to put it as our bottom of the list though.
Yeah, next up.
I think someone who comes close to very few memes, maybe
CTA the right opinion.
Are there any well?
No idea.
He gets credited with rags doesn't he?
I think we give him rags because it was his editing team
that did it, but it still belongs to him.
narrative tripling.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I have to pick it up.
No, I would I'd agree.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I would say yeah, cuz he's he's not like Mimi.
He's just sad.
I I I wouldn't he doesn't like.
I don't yeah, I put a C at the highest.
All right.
I think see the suitable place Joseph Anderson.
So let's see.
My review has been viewed by more people than anyone.
That's a very disgusting horror game subjectivity is implied.
So it was not a horror.
Yeah, yeah.
That was spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky.
Undertale.
So we're A ish.
A to S is probably going to be isn't this probably.
Yeah, he's I'd say a yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I like a say he's a.
Looks like Chad is straddling between A and S.
Okay.
Oh dude, massive came out of him.
Oh, that's right.
Oh shit.
He's S now that boobs him up to S.
Yeah, congratulations.
Joseph.
Good job.
You're more Mimi than Matt Jarbo.
You did it.
You did it.
You win the internet.
I like the phrase that as massive came out of him.
All right.
Cosmonal variety hour.
Do we have anything on that guy?
I was going to say we might be looking at a B or C here because I can't
remember.
You can't remember you.
You don't get to be if you can't even remember.
Yeah.
I'd say he's a cinema since got the plank.
That was it.
Yeah, but what's what do we have of Cosmo stupid shit?
But I don't think any of us we did actually kind of like his joke about
the whole close shut this damn door and he bleeped it.
Remember that?
That was kind of funny.
I don't know if that counts as a meme though.
I'd say that's still D.
Do any memes chat?
Do any memes come from me?
I'm saying the prize.
No memes have come from him.
Yeah, I'm saying D.
Also, I'm sure a year to six months right.
That's just right.
Well, when we're in here for whatever of you just try isn't in
this list.
No.
Is there a way to add people to the list as you're on it?
Save download reset reset create template.
I'm guessing you have to like upload the pictures individually.
Damn just right.
We can we can do an honorary thing with just right.
We'll probably do him next.
I know we can't put him in but we decide where you go so screenshot
the tail is I'm not seeing like any memes about Cosmo.
Is he a D then?
He's a do you think is a D?
Yeah, all right.
Cause he's he says some yeah, just right.
Probably be an S rank.
If we had him here, I imagine he's point big.
Do you think he would be S huh?
Yeah, he probably would actually.
Yeah.
He did be giddiest didn't he?
A lot of great shits come out of just right.
Yeah, a lot of shits come out of just right.
Did I hit everything on you?
We have we haven't covered and I hit everything video on eFap
yet.
Yeah, only Rags did.
We will get it eventually.
He pops up every once in a while because of it, but we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, and as much as we could use never bored, it's we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, we probably S rank just right.
If we had him next up shinobi.
We're looking at like a probably a C again.
I don't know.
No memes that came the stage from him, right?
Yeah, he was like he has a Mimi personality, but no real
memes came from him that we say as far as I know D.
Let me see.
Oh, I guess D would be more accurate.
Yeah.
D is pretty accurate.
I know he blew his channel up after the cover, you know, there
was yelling into the mic and piercing your ears and saying
the blank and then responds.
He talks it through did not come from shinobi.
So when it really I thought it did.
No toxic road came from I think was AJ the OP soon.
Yeah, that was well, I fucked up the thing.
So no, but
yeah, so yeah, I guess he's a D someone.
Someone is saying that shinobi is the origin of the episode
nine question.
Oh, that might bump him up.
Well, would it bump him up to C?
I mean C is an interesting collection.
We've got the guy made no memes, but he created well,
he wrote alien corner is the guy was kind of man, but there
was some things almost like where you go if you just don't
belong in D and we don't know where to put you.
It's like a purgatory here at this point.
I'm okay with putting him at C because of that.
That's kind of what it looks like.
It's what the tier is becoming.
C is like a not meme-y but technically not meme-less either.
Yeah.
He's got at least some power level.
Yeah, it's C is kind of almost normie tier and D is just
boring people.
Eric slash Patricia Taksim.
That's up pretty high.
I'm trying to think of specific memes that came from her.
Yeah, I don't know about.
Yeah, that's a good point specific memes.
I'm not certain just an extremely strange.
I would say vindictive intelligent person extremely could
be C.
What is chat saying?
I think really name a good meme that came out of
Patricia Taksim.
That's a thing.
I can't.
That's why I'm thinking it's C.
I think it's C.
Oh, little centrist boy.
Little centrist boy.
Yeah.
When do we use it?
It was a monumentally ugly.
It was titatically ugly.
We use it during a gig Cadell episode.
Well, oh, yeah, the centrist boy.
Yeah, it's a little centrist boy.
Yeah, that would play C, right?
Because I think that's still C.
Yeah.
For centrism.
All right.
I guess that's a C.
Damn.
Cinema wins.
Cinema wins.
Remind me what we covered from.
Oh, the TLJ one.
Yeah, the TLJ one.
Were there any memes from that?
Were there any memes from that?
I don't know, man.
I feel like we've got nothing for cinema wins.
I can't remember.
Yeah, I think that might be a D.
Just bad video, not meme.
I'm looking at, yeah, we got loads of D's in chat.
The D's are flying through.
Yep.
Yeah, boy.
I don't agree.
So many D's.
Where is F?
What's something like Ocean Man?
Oh, did Ocean Man?
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because cinema wins went on about people's themes and that's
where that came from.
But I don't think it's, I don't think it was his like, like
while he led to it.
I don't think you can really credit the meme to it.
Oh, and Kyle Ben came out of that too, in a way.
But it wasn't, I don't think it was anything you should credit
to him.
Surely we have to credit them when memes are created.
Like, for example, all the Jeb memes are now accredited to
Jeb Nichols.
Sure, at least.
Yeah.
That puts him in a C, right?
I would, yeah, C. C's fit in with the rest of the memes.
Even more of a C minus, but there is no C minus.
Okay, which takes us to Sarah Z.
Someone said Kyle, someone's Kyle Ben came from Drunk Rags.
I mean, it was definitely the logic of Kyle Ben.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you accidentally, you said, I said, you either said
Kylo Ben or Kylo or Kyle Ren and then we doubled it up because
we thought it was, yeah, because it was a whole like play
Kyle's theme and stuff like that.
Yeah, so there's the fly meme which puts her at least at a
C. I think that's it though, isn't it?
There was the meme about her being the sister of Jared.
I don't know if that had my staying power, probably not.
I don't remember it.
Oh, we, someone saying the burned door that linked to Jared's
room.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
I think that's it though, which kind of places her C.
C. Jack Saint.
I'm thinking we're just gonna need to put him next to Patty
Tax and be done.
Not very, not very meme-able, is he?
No, he's not.
He's kind of a boorish idiot.
Yeah, there's not really a lot that's there to meme.
I'm trying to think of anything.
That was seed seers getting stacked.
Not a lot of fun comes out of that, dude.
Just not a lot of fun at all.
We could be in a D sort of thing for that, actually.
Yeah, I would say, yeah, I'd say he certainly loves me.
If he's got long man bat comes from him.
Oh my god, yeah.
Oh, that's one of the strongest memes we have.
Long man bat is one of the greatest memes.
But we, but I think, did we come up with that because of
him or is he the one who counted?
Oh, he definitely didn't say long man bad, but we came up
with it because of his video.
I'm thinking that he didn't say long critique is not deep
critique is what he had said.
I'm fine with a at least at their bare minimum and a for
that really.
I would go that far.
I would say that we do long the long man think of all the
memes that became of long man.
All the one meme.
It is a powerful.
Yeah, still this means that it's not just quantity.
It is quality.
I guess why do you have to answer?
Yeah, well, we were able to name like four or five things
from Jojo.
You know, what's crazy is I am that Robbie is coming up
soon and didn't the dawn come from his video or was that?
It was one of the people we covered for Captain Marvel.
Wasn't that brown table?
Oh, the whole straw man doing whichever one had Jack as
well.
Robot head is gassed.
Which one was that robot head?
Oh, yeah, Jack is responsible for like a lot of the straw
man memes.
Well, it's between A and B.
I think at this point.
I'm fine with B.
Oh, I will accept to be it's once it's one strong meme
that gets him up to be but it's like I don't I wouldn't
say to write that but that was legal out of her.
No, no, it must have been I'm I'm that Robbie because it
was robot head started it.
He started the meme and it was I'm that Robbie is the one
that he guessed it on.
So yeah, but we've got yeah, I'm fine with B.
It doesn't put it puts above the quagmire of C.
We got straw man and long man bad coming out of him, which
is strong but with do we definitely concluding that he's
lower than Matt, Matt, Matt job over then.
Yeah, he's lower than that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Game makers toolkit.
Hi.
Oh, that's gonna be I know how meme-able he is for that
too.
Yeah.
Yeah, because that's the thing.
It's just like everything he says.
Yeah, like there's so much out of his mouth.
When it comes to if have so much inspiration come from
this guy.
I mean, it is already down the bottom.
Yeah.
Goodell is entirely like supposed to be afraid does his
show.
Yeah, it's a tile for press the
forms.
The aim for
the double jump.
He's so fantastic.
Is he Jay jump?
No, not quite.
He's got a lot of good means, but he doesn't.
He's not rhino milk.
Dark Souls.
Dark Souls.
He's Dark Souls.
Some people are asking us about like Dark Souls.
No, he's not.
We know who that's reserved for.
We know who God like is.
One slot for God like I think.
I don't know.
So you guys plus you guys deciding s plus I'm going with
s plus two.
What's the three remaining votes?
I agree.
Yeah, s plus is good.
I would say s but I'm happy with s plus.
You just don't want to
You don't want to
Come on Jay share.
Don't be dad guy.
Ren's reviews or Ren reviews.
I can't see not too familiar with the guy.
There was a couple memes.
There's a couple
Let me other than the meme list, but he's not got any proper
memes.
He's like it's a B or C.
I think really so what would you say what would lift him out
of C?
Yeah, what pushes him up to a B actually?
Yeah.
Okay.
I changed my vote just to see he was a familiar faces guy
right multiple faces.
Yeah, remember like what multiple faces.
He gave us a live example of somebody like refusing to accept
information moving the goal post like seven times in a row.
That is true with the mask creator.
Yeah, I was crazy.
That was in that was really interesting.
That was the having him watch that specifically after we
pulled up the clip and showed it to him.
It's it's like a man losing his religion.
It was very odd.
He created Southpaw.
Hmm does that lift him out of C?
It's not D, but it's not A.
So it's.
Yeah, I don't know about the loaded A right now.
He's gonna be alone where free goes.
She's in good company, but I doubt I doubt anything would really
take him out of C.
Yeah, someone's saying bringing forth Southpaw meme.
I agree.
That's fair.
Let's go to multiple places me first.
I'm watching one of these for wake Robin in the chat.
We're ranking the meme ability of all the the e fat villains.
So why didn't you say you more you can't change team when
it's convenient that mean change team change team first off.
Don't take it too seriously.
Yeah, I'm ranking the meme ability of e fat villains.
Well, you mean you're you're not taking this seriously.
So yeah, very seriously.
This is like the most important thing.
I've done all I'd say C.
I think C.
Yeah, he Stacey.
Okay.
So next up according to me is God like yeah, God like if you
disagree, you're wrong.
God like you're wrong.
You're objectively wrong.
God like damn.
He's that fantastic.
I'm just curious.
What's happening is there any disagreements if any if anyone
disagrees kill them.
I'm so I was gonna say that kill came out.
God like God like God like God like 1.2 we create 1.2.
There's no point in referencing all the memes that come out
of him.
There's too many.
There's too many.
We'll have a whole episode.
Total tier.
Total tier.
There's a whole tier.
A plus to T.
I'm putting down agreement.
Leave God like empty.
What he wasn't putting down agreements.
That was me.
No, I know but I say get a chat.
Yeah, there you go.
Leave God like empty and have Tonal be ascended above it.
Yeah, we've got like a total tier above God like T rank.
And then next we have toxic group T or Captain.
I can't even fucking see it because of the background color.
Okay.
Are you actually adding another one?
Yeah, it says it's wrong.
Ronald Donald total add to dictionary totaled.
Yes, how do you the heavenly color?
I'll add row above.
Okay.
Here it is.
I see it.
There.
So you change God likes a black now put it back.
I have to check this to be sure but I'm pretty sure AJ is the
guy we covered with world-class bullshits and geeks and gamers.
He's the one who did the toxic brood.
The thing about how you'd follow a waitress into an alleyway
with a knife.
If she don't know what the fuck that was anymore.
I'm trying to remember it.
What are we looking at?
Yeah, at least s it definitely sounds very sane.
Yeah, toxic brood ends in a lot of points.
What do you think chat?
What other memes came from that video?
I can't even remember.
He named the community Medea was born in that episode.
I don't know if it was his fault in any way though.
Medea was born.
John Adam spider.
Oh shit.
That was that episode.
Oh, see the one looks like you're allowed to like he was
all.
Yeah, you're allowed to like this plus s plus really.
I'm okay with now.
No, no, I don't know.
I don't think he's s look at s plus these are lame generators.
He's not like he's made some strong memes.
That's for sure.
He must have the highest memes per minute generation.
Well, his video was long.
Yeah, but still it's not like well game makers toolkit
generates me.
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
And tonals meme generation is off the charts quite literally.
We had to we had to extend the chart to include him.
I'm saying s yeah, I'm cool with s.
Yeah, s is good.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
We got the high tiers getting some good company now.
I am that Robbie who is responsible for the dawn a ha ha a
for the dawn.
Really?
I don't know man.
That's that's another super strong.
It's another super strong, but it's one so far.
We need to wait.
Wasn't he the top-voted man by the community?
He was yeah, I think we need to see if that's still the case
because there are new memes now.
There are more relevant me.
Yeah, but the fact that it won that poll anyway is yeah,
I mean it and I would say that does he get credit for that?
I can I can support him being an S if it's created.
I think that's our rules.
Anyway.
All right.
Yeah, that's fine.
I can support him being an S because it keeps my job.
Oh, I think it matches s got the creation of the toxic brood
in there as well.
Yo, somebody just sent hang on somebody just sent me a list
of updated memes.
There's a whole lot more names in here.
Do we want to go to this one?
Oh, give me the is the same as this.
If you give me the link, I'll just slot everybody.
We've done already.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, we're almost done.
Wait, no, no, I'm in this shit.
Here it is.
All right.
Thank you to kibakins.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, yes.
I do wonder what this like tier list would look like if it
was entirely community vote based.
Yeah, there's so many more now.
All I do is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Oh, there we go.
And I'm just gonna put this over here a second while I slot
everybody into the oh my God, that's a lot.
So Sarah Z was not see we didn't do.
Wynton.
Yeah, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Jay.
Yeah, shut up.
Tornald.
It's tornald.
We're missing from oh, he's down there.
AJ.
Yeah, mr.
Anderson.
Oh, where's Monday Matt?
Matt was a no, I mean, where is he in the pictures?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, three three fuck theater.
That's him, right?
He's three, but theater is him.
Then we need Willems and Jack Saint and oh, I got a whole
bunch through here.
Film joy.
TRO, where are you?
Oh, is TRO not in here?
Whoops.
We lose TRO.
Yeah, but I mean, you know, he was in the sea.
So I guess it's not too bad.
The sea is where he is there where he's already in sea.
Oh, I'm retarded.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm retarded too.
Then.
All right.
Tax on.
There we go.
Cinema wins.
Doo doo and D was cinema sins.
And there we are.
All right.
I have successfully transferred old man.
Well.
All right.
So next up is Quentin reviews.
It's got to be a high scorer.
Who's that right next to him?
He kind of looks like Quentin reviews.
It's the guy we covered in the small video, the director
of Shazam.
We watched his five-minute video.
Well, he can put him and D right away.
Yeah, that's the D.
Quentin is probably 80.
At least that was a very strong.
That fucking thing was pretty strong.
I don't think he's a little strong manning.
Is that really put him above long man bad though?
And Teddy Milk is my favorite addition to so was.
Hmm.
You make a point.
See what chat has to say.
When to see the AOS review is just the description of your
experiences.
Yeah, he has a lot of new characters plot lore consistency.
It's just fan stuff.
I fucking hate Trump rags.
I'm like rags thinks the movie is objectively bad.
If it sells toys.
Oh, and and and it's the his opinions.
Well, they are subject or they are objective.
There are a couple of these memes but a lot of them some
people might not even remember some of these.
They're a bit.
Some people might not even remember what a y-wing is.
I would just write is wonderful.
I would say he's already getting up there between everybody
always asks why wing they never ask how wing do you want
better?
Why wing?
Got it.
I want well, I'm just gonna go come myself.
I'm okay with a what's what's everyone feeling?
It's AOS in the chat.
What I'm asking you guys.
Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, that's a rags.
It literally isn't showing your icon.
So I'm like, oh my god.
It worked.
My icon is gone for you.
It's gone.
That's a screenshot of it.
It's just not there.
Well, rip me in your it's actually weird not having your
icon.
It's like you're talking to me from some other place.
Just the fact that you're right there.
All right.
Well, actually, where are you?
So pop culture detective who we have not covered since I
think episode.
I want to say three could be to classic.
He's three.
One who had the hilarious take on TLJ, but I'm not sure
what memes have survived from that.
Yeah, I'm trying to think right now.
He might just be be.
I mean, I'm trying to think of what is his theme reaching
idiot.
I don't think anything that I know of.
I don't know who this is.
This next one.
Help us out.
Who's this guy?
Who is that?
Could be just like so one of the random videos we've covered
before.
Probably is.
D rank.
Oh, obviously.
These are all from if after me.
Oh, yeah, which means I can just go there and look at the
list and find him.
Somebody said he did the core of it with ER.
Oh, did he was that him?
If it wasn't the core of it just right.
I feel like I don't know cuz didn't that where big ideas
came from?
Yeah, he did.
Why core is better than Aang Avatar than Aang yet.
So so that was not just right.
No, this guy.
Well, he did a core video too.
Oh got it.
Yeah, that guy we've he's gotta be D.
There's nothing I remember about that.
I don't even better remember covering the video, but we
yeah, we watched it with the R.
Put him in C just for nostalgia.
No, you don't get C for nostalgia.
No.
All right, Major Lee.
Major Lee S plus it's a possible S plus.
He's a slice.
He's really up there.
So we got a slice and dice.
Look at women.
Look at women.
Just just those two on their own.
I think put some in at least s.
That's the problem is certainly a pretty wrong one.
And he is just a meme on his own as well.
Like he is well, does he lose any does he lose points for
being like like his motivations being kind of?
Oh, you mean like a funny man?
Yeah, like just trying to be provocative for its own sake.
That's good losing points that I think they kick him out of
s plus.
Yeah, I would because I think that the the the integrity
if that's the way to call it the the honesty of their
you know, the way they carry themselves as part of it.
Like he seems very disingenuous.
I'd agree with that.
Yeah, so but not in the way the others are.
But what I will say is we don't know for sure because I'm
happy to actually believe that he's well, he says he that's
what he said, isn't he?
Yeah, but that's my meat.
That's what I mean.
Like so he says a lot of stupid shit and it's like, are
you fucking seriously listening?
He's like, no, I'm going to evoke you.
Who said touched fingers was that guy?
Yeah, that was him.
Yeah, so what is that?
Like I think that he partially said that as a sort of cover
for how stupid a lot of the stuff that he says is that might
drop him to S because of what reg said about how he yeah,
I agree.
I think he's an ass.
Yeah, and also the I mean the whole debate was just a nightmare
nightmare.
So there is the next is that a wing.
What is that?
It's a sleek legal.
I have no idea.
Is that legal legal legal legal legal?
It is legal legal.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, and then he was the one saying like you touch the
map and that's battery.
It's at least he's not he's above sea.
So is that where Don's from?
No, no, no.
Bolstered I think I think he bolstered the Don for sure to
be like, you know, he's on really flourished is a charitable
guy and then he and then she fucked him up.
Yeah.
I think since we're doing all of them the official meme rating
needs to appear on efap.me next to the profile.
The rating for the total this is total.
I'm liking me so far for the guy unless we can come up with
any more that he had.
Or we got two means they didn't go long, but they're good ones.
He meant us more angry though.
Like he legit like made me angry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He it was just kind of disgusting the video like and kind
of threatening in much above sea at that point.
He came after the Don like there you do you do get docked
points for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's another one of those ones where he is himself.
Oops.
Heard him breath so many times as a joke.
He battered her.
Are we thinking like she's bad.
BOC sorry by that logic.
She she battered Stanley.
So is everyone happy with me?
Yeah.
All right, Jim Sterling privilege goggles.
That is all privilege goggles privilege goggles doesn't
get referenced that much which puts is that C.
I think it would be c-plus, but I think yeah see could be
a B.
Yeah, so I see competition is a little tough.
We've got some echo C to be honest.
See he's not he's no long man.
That's like putting privilege goggles on the same level as
long and I think C is pretty decided that B is one strong
meme.
A is like either one strong meme with a couple of bonus
memes and then S is like several strong memes and S plus
is like several great memes.
Which would mean with more memes to come which puts Jim
Sterling in like a C surely.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, he's just not really bright or anything.
So what culture is next D D.
Yeah, I'm even having trouble kind of remembering.
Yeah.
Next up is always that never look.
Oh, yes, it's Jeff Nichols.
Jeff Nichols probably A.
We don't know how those memes are going to last.
Yeah, I think A is fair because there's some great memes
that come out of it, but we don't know how long they'll
last.
Sure.
I could see B though.
I'm happy to agree with A if everyone's.
We're going to share.
We've got A, B, B, A, D, B, God T.
I just don't know that those memes haven't like caught up
to me yet.
So I don't know.
Got a lot of different takes the Jeb Bush meme.
I don't know how long that'll last.
I don't know what's going to happen with it.
I think it's strong.
My name is Jeb.
What else was there in that stream?
There's a lot of stuff.
Yeah, because it was like just it was more wrong than Mimi.
Sure.
It was flat out wrong.
Oh, what was it the direct quote where she said, I think
it was exactly these words, watching fantastic beasts gives
me immense sexual satisfaction.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm always coming for fantastic beasts.
I think I nailed it the first time.
Looks like that might, you think that is an A?
I think that's no, there's no way it's not an A.
No.
Well, we've got, well, the thing is with A, it's like one
strong meme with several memes or several medium memes, like
she's got an extremely strong meme and a couple of other ones.
I mean, still making Jeb jokes when the damn stream started
today.
It was kind of nuts.
You know, it might not last, who knows?
But I think an A is a safe spot for now.
A provisional A.
Yeah, because A is a middle.
She could go lower or higher as time progresses.
You think we should hold on to this in case these are subject
to change, like somebody might start like come up with a
really crazy-ass meme.
You can save your lists.
Yeah, I have to compare a year from now.
So insider, I don't even remember covering insider.
D, no idea what it is.
If we can't remember who this is, they go to D.
Yeah.
Who?
Go to D.
Oh, that gave up for bars.
I remember us covering him briefly.
Fun, but I don't think any memes can happen.
Yeah, there was probably a D-reg because he's terrible,
but I don't think any memes came out of it.
His meme ability is low.
D.
Who is FBF?
Frame by frame, that was the guy who did the video on how
Ray is not a Mary Sue, I think.
We covered it during the 50th with Doomcock and Critical
Drinker, I think.
No idea.
Not remembering any memes from it, though.
No, I don't remember it.
All right, off to D.
Sorry, man.
Extra credits.
Oof.
That's a strong meme.
You're a Nazi.
That's like, that's like prime meme, like, and it was in
general.
I know this is just an eFap thing, but man, when they made
that video.
Wildfire on the internet.
That has been like the, I think it might be one of the
most responded.
Oh, sorry.
Frame by frame is sword like weapon.
Oh, that puts me in C then.
Ooh.
Maybe even B.
Yeah, it's a strong meme, but I think we received because
B's strong memes are pretty damn strong.
Yeah.
Stick like weapon.
Yeah.
All right.
No, that's fair.
And then ask for extra credits.
What are we looking at here?
Anywhere between an A and B.
A, A, A of B.
I'm happy with A.
Like,
there's only one potential.
Like, oh, yeah, but that's like a like a general meme for
everyone to be honest.
It's not like eFap exclusive.
So I would actually go for B.
Personally.
Yeah, that in mind B is looking a little more.
I'll fight with that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I can agree with that too.
I'm all right with that.
DX.
What was DX's video?
Is that, that's not sausage man, right?
No, sausage man is criminal.
No, we had him on, right?
DX was a subjectivity.
That was a, he's the Holocaust denier.
Wait, really?
He actually deadly to die.
Okay, I was about to say.
No.
It just, I think it just misspoke in a really weird way.
It's like, oh, no, no, no, no.
Probably C.
What are the memes?
Because I remember the conversation.
I'm trying to remember any memes that came from it.
Chat helps out.
Same.
I've been playing some cards on the side and I haven't got Piccadilly yet.
I don't think you can derive joy from a fictional event.
Oh, he said words only have one meaning.
Oh, yeah.
Was that him?
That was him, wasn't it?
That's probably a B.
Ooh, that might be a B.
I like we've made a certainly no longer boring.
Kind of looks like a Christmas tree.
What we have right now.
Yeah, like half a Christmas tree.
I mean, it's just the star on top.
Yeah, although that in mind,
who's going to have anybody here's God like exactly.
What's looking at this list?
Well, you know, we're going to we're going to go through a revision at the end.
We're going to take a look at the list.
Adjust accordingly based on where everyone out because at the beginning
we didn't have any reference.
So now that we're getting there at the end we can go through.
Watch Mojo.
I think that's a D right.
I don't fucking remember.
I'm sorry.
I hate to I hate to bring this up, but Cosmic Chicken Goliath.
Oh shit.
Watch Mojo memes.
That was that stream.
That's like I would consider that efap honorary efap.
Wow, that was an amazing stream with cynic snacks until that's non-canon made
by Disney when they non-canonize after that probably actually lifts them
up to at least a I might even say S.
Yeah, this Goliath cosmic chicken.
Yeah, those are the only memes in that stream.
Were they surely though?
I swear there were more in that.
That's the meme where that's the stream where we got like a tonal congealed
in a cave.
Oh god, that's an orphan lore.
Yeah, that's it.
Wow, that's that's that's that's definitely.
Yes, that's my love how much has got nothing to do with.
It wasn't it wasn't it wasn't the orphans like got continued there.
They didn't originate that true.
But a lot of the significant orphan law did come.
Yeah, what do we think?
The open bone does as he came from that is still like an S still like an S.
That's that's that's weird because wolf just said that's a godlike mean really
with the cosmic chicken is a god.
I guess we could put them in there.
Mo man Mojo is actually orphans cosmic chicken.
Tonaled congealing.
They get godlike status for no reason of their own like yeah, but
that's the problem is the a lot of the memes that generate because of us
anyway, so I don't do we I don't think we can give them godlike status
because they didn't it's not and none of them is there for like at all.
No, I'd still say it's S they just got lucky.
I'm fine with S because I think what Jay saying is a good point
where it wasn't really them in any way at all.
It was S we're there because of watch.
Well, Joe, they they only spoke to attribute it solely to whatever
they say they'd be indeed.
No, yeah, but no, they did spawn like the deserts.
I think we give them credit for the fact that that's a mean that didn't
move on in any way though that stayed right there.
We got a lot of that like that happened on their watch, which I think
we need to give them credit for which a lot of credit for those
memes, but they didn't actually do anything for it.
So they can't be super high.
All right.
So what is what you're saying a now a yeah, a is think I think
is appropriate.
I think yeah, I'm fine with a fine.
Okay, because of that.
Yeah.
All right.
If we're consistent with that.
Scipulation a yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I agree.
Next up is I don't know who that is.
Lee Dave Lee Down Under Down Under.
No, this thing was I can't even like I will fight.
I'll find out from you have 43.
Was it 43?
I'm not sure what I can't I remember.
I know what it was.
It was the fact that you guys can't even remember is probably
evidence for how it was a D.
We almost gave watch Mojo a D though.
I mean technically I still think they kind of deserve it.
It depends on what the ruling is the complication.
If we really had to go, I would say at least see but I say
they're all right a day right now.
Anyway, this guy.
Who is he if we establish that?
Well, that's the problem.
I'm still trying to actually figure out something from like
chat to be able to explain this because I I don't remember.
Oh, it's Dale.
I think.
Dale's a lot of stuff.
Was it which was Dale the one that was like men hate Star Wars
or the ruining so that's the next one.
No, it's not.
Oh, that's no, that's the one you're on that.
So the stream was behind for me.
Yeah, there's a little behind too.
I've refreshed it twice now.
It's like way it's just a YouTube latency.
It's not that you can do about it.
Yeah, men ruining Star Wars.
See there's not a lot that actually stayed from even his debate
portion and the video because it was just terrible.
I think it was the fact that you didn't stand for any of it.
COD.
Probably C.
Yeah, I'd say C.
I have no idea.
I don't know the guys.
Next up is Sausage Man.
A yellow pipe and sausage man are very like not super strong
memes, but they I think it puts them at a B.
Mm-hmm.
Apparently film was cinema Roberto gave Doc fate 7 out of 10.
How does this keep happening?
Good shark.
Yeah, people are saying B.
B.
C.
Mainly B.
So what did he do?
It was the yellow pole sausage.
Oh, the yeah, yeah, yeah the yellow pole guy.
I feel like there were more from that stream though.
Are we missing anything?
I think drink that stream halfway through.
Yeah, and I came back at the end.
I would probably place in between B and C, but I'm liking B so
far.
Sausage was pretty good.
We got a we got a few really good drawings out of that.
Sausage Raider.
That was good shit.
Yeah, I have no memory of any of those.
Yeah, I'm putting on B.
I would say B.
B then I guess.
So be it.
Next one's like a seat picture.
I'm trying to see what is that comic book cast to.
Thanks to this last song.
Which one was this?
Yeah, I'm trying to look at the channel.
I don't remember.
Look like a microphone to me.
You know, I really love how useful this site is that we've
got here.
It's so crazy.
Who are these people?
They were covered during.
Wait, what did I?
All right.
Efap six.
Holy shit.
Wow.
Wait, really?
Oh, the guy the guy who had like oh my god, this is a deep
little rice.
You remember this?
He was like trying to look at all the things.
Oh my god, so so nostalgic.
He's he had like Wolf was disappointed because he had a
whole bunch of witcher stuff.
He's I think he was his whole video was basically saying
that TLJ sold well.
So it's not that bad.
I do remember this is going back.
I think I do remember like I remember.
Yeah.
The toys.
This guy that we've completely forgotten about him though.
Yeah, that's got to be D status.
Yeah, probably.
Yeah.
Wait, so it's not it's not useful because they sell toys
who said that?
No, that was that's I think that's combining Quinton's
quote about Racks.
Quinton said that Racks thinks a movie is objectively bad
if it sells toys.
Right.
I don't understand that statement.
Next up we go closer look which is pretty epic celestial
even bone-chilling.
Epic celestial bone-chilling bone-chilling.
You can't do the voice.
Yeah, bone-chilling.
B or D.
B or C.
What?
No, he's getting like an A.
Really?
You think that's A?
Dude, people are saying epic and celestial all the fucking
time.
I say it on my stream like every time.
Yeah, Mal says it constantly.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Epic with a few steel.
Uncomfortable with it.
What do you think chat?
We got A, C, A, C, A, A, A, A, K, A, C for celestial, A, A, B, A, C
for celestial.
I guess A is where he's sitting.
Fighter productions.
Who dat?
Who dat?
Code them on 50 apparently.
Victorie.
I don't remember fighter productions.
No.
Part one.
Fighter productions.
Tism.
So I wish I could check this stuff out.
The guy who did the civil war coverage.
That wasn't very good.
I think it's a D.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, D.
Sorry fighter productions.
Then we got guy who he's prototype Patrick Willems and yeah.
Well, Patrick Willems stole from him.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
D.
Yeah, D.
Like I bet a lot of people are probably like shocked to see
that face.
I'm surprised that you remembered it because I was about
trying to explain that's who he was.
Yeah, he's basically the whole plot holes.
People shouldn't focus on plot holes thing that Patrick
Williams did.
This guy did it too.
So he has got one slight meme.
Oh, yeah.
I redrafted this nine times over 11.
Yeah, he did say that.
Yeah, but did anyone ever use that?
Is that I swear I've heard that come up again.
He's not totally meme-less.
You saw what D is.
I thought D was like, you know, cinema sins is plank.
It doesn't matter the plan at least.
That's true.
Actually.
Yeah, yeah.
He's key.
Okay.
He's D.
Vox.
We covered them saying that the X-Men cinematic universe
makes a lot more sense than Marvel's.
No, no.
Yeah, I just say that.
That's a D.
I can't remember anything else about that video.
I mean Vox is a meme, but nothing even related.
No, we don't even reference much of anything about it.
Yeah.
Now we got Wisecrack who created Allen.
The middle is the best thing ever.
We're lost forever.
This is my favorite part.
S.
That's a pretty high meme.
That's pretty.
I'd say A at least.
Probably say A.
So we're looking at between A and S.
What does everyone think?
Allen, the middle and I think wasn't that the me high cheeks
and me high stream.
Put him in A because that's the middle rank.
I don't know, man.
We've just read this.
Yeah, but it's sure it's in the middle, but tonaled is tonaled
and we have no god likes yet.
I think he should be an S.
This is pretty strong meme material.
There needs to be a tier separating everyone else from tonaled
and that's godlike.
We'll figure it out if it's all right.
Yeah, I'm okay with S.
Yeah, me high cheeks get me high.
All the middle stuff Allen.
Yeah, remarkable Republican.
Oh, that's like A or S.
Loud soup.
Our camel is a lesbian.
Oh, Robocop.
There's a ripoff.
Dove Vader.
Yeah, Robocop.
I think S.
Because C3PO is a gay butler.
Taiwan has to apex homosexual.
Oh, yeah, apex homosexual.
Apex homosexual.
We've got the fucking shit of him wanting to build a theocracy
on Mars.
Oh shit.
We got no bullshit.
So suspicious amount of women.
Suspicious amount of
That's the amount of a meme.
Giant midget.
Giant midget.
So would that so far he's B.
Say at least a B.
Can we think of any more that came of that?
He does get referenced a little bit.
Yeah, I think he said he does get referenced a lot.
That's right.
And I feel like his memes you could do a lot with them.
Mm-hmm malleable memes suspicious amount of women will
never die.
Yes.
I've never heard that before.
So I was trans.
Yeah.
He did say that is trans.
What the hell is transhuman?
Over representation of giant midgets thing.
Of course perfectly balanced.
Um, yeah, so is everyone happy with B?
Yeah, I'm fine with B.
Yeah, just from what I've heard.
I'm fine with B.
Yeah.
Oh my goodness.
Just right.
S plus.
Just right.
God like in meme factory.
Well, let's read a response theory.
We've got read a response.
That's how big idiots is ironic.
Oh, yeah, I like he's ironic.
So those three alone get him to S plus.
I think yeah, and so we had the people don't remember
why we got pretty great as well.
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
And then there was the debate that you guys had with him.
Oh, God, the robot.
We said people came from that people don't remember this
thing.
The fact that you like first viewing first viewing.
Oh, yeah.
Didn't know that God like I don't I don't know if that's
God like because S plus is so strong.
Yeah, it is.
I I might put I probably put a mess plus.
Oh, good.
Rats is brown table guys.
It's not good.
Rat is brown table.
Table is covered.
Brown table is fantastic.
So people are saying good rat.
So I'm Karl Marx.
This reminds me of Karl Marx.
That's that's your that's brown.
Yeah, so we got to wait for brown tables.
Okay, did he say did he say evolve as a critic?
Yes.
He did.
I think he's got like I think we have a God like I think
we've got God like memes here.
Damn.
Oh man.
Chat one for God like to first s plus just just report
because I almost feel like wanted to never work city
keeps him from God like and so on like four of them have
worked.
Oh man, you also have to say God like he's got to be God
like to talk about Cora.
We have to bring up an 18th century German philosopher.
Hey Jay.
Hey Jay.
Oh, it doesn't work.
Look at those ones.
Look at him.
Yeah, he's got like yeah, it's settled.
Congratulations.
Just right.
You are the God like if at me, you are the God like he fat
me.
It's so great because he's such a pretentious youtuber.
So he's gonna be like, what do you mean of a giant beam?
He's extremely pretentious and his brain size can't justify
it which makes it so Mimi next up is high top which would
obviously probably rank it's a D.
I don't remember him being beamed at all.
Hi top.
It's got some not great videos, but he's I don't particularly
remember anything Mimi about it.
People this people every once in a while people will ping
and say what about Wags is like that guy's not on here.
Yeah, Wags Wags is IHE's buddy on the podcast.
We can we can barely say that belongs to IHE.
So yeah, it's not even IHE.
It's the IHE's buddy.
Wags won't be on me.
Unfortunately.
He was on the island of speech impediments.
He can't help it, but it's still a meme.
He made a channel that we covered that he made a channel.
I'm sure he'd have amazing takes.
Wait, he references.
That's actually not a terrible idea.
This is such a bizarre stream.
Just FYI.
It's fun though.
All right.
So yeah, I'm fine with high top being just a D.
So we got Hello Greedo.
Hello Greedo.
At least B.
I'd say at least B as well.
Yeah, what are his names?
So I couldn't think of a waste of time more than debating art.
Right.
Yeah, I got that.
What an interesting person.
I don't know that you might be a C because the problem with
his memes they don't last from what I remember.
He is himself a meme.
True.
True.
But does that get you to B status?
I think so.
Yeah.
Extra credits and Patrick Willems are certainly memes.
Yeah, I guess Jack Saint is kind of a meme.
Oh, you.
Yeah, I certainly say I think when we mention Hello Greedo,
I in probably a fairly substantial part of the audience
thinks of him as a meme.
Like we don't take him seriously.
I'm just remembering his type photo.
His type fighter.
Yeah, and his he where he streams wearing a helmet.
Why the fuck bother?
Why he has set up a face cam so that they cover your face
so no one can see his face cam for my helmet.
Did a meme come out of him when people talk to him on stream
at one point?
Yeah, that was mainly just him misunderstanding.
You've had memes.
Not really like okay.
I wasn't sure if he said something like in response and
it kind of came out wrong.
I'm not I can't remember wearing a mask for a face
cam that didn't like that was more just a joke that rags
made that was funny.
Like it doesn't really evolve into anything of a meme.
Hmm.
Yeah, say with the tie fighter.
I think he's himself.
So the tight.
Yeah, his his mind are Minecraft skills memeable.
Not really everyone's typing in Jamaican.
Oh, yeah, because you're making it up.
Yeah, he looked up massive.
Oh, yeah, and then it was Jamaican.
That's what he said.
Well, this is why I think he's probably that makes him
be.
Yeah, I said be.
All right, then.
All right.
Yeah, it I think he's been around long enough.
We've covered him long enough and he's brought us enough
joy and laughter that he's elevated out of the sea quagmire.
Yeah, welcome to be welcome to be here.
So we got to the young ticks that one video from Joker.
We watched.
I remember the video.
I'm trying to think of women.
The funny thing is that it opened with just say Joker hates
black people or whatever.
It doesn't like black.
Joker has a problem with black.
Right, right.
Yeah.
Dither.
I I'd probably put him in D.
Yeah, D.
I can't I don't think we spent too much time with it.
Well, it was only a three minute video after that.
It wasn't a very long video.
It was only three minutes, but it was horrible.
Oh, yeah, it's it's TYT man.
That's the thing shit in terms of quality of video because
we'll do that next.
That should be easier than this because there's not going
to be as much memory.
Yeah.
But yeah, he's a Captain Midnight.
D because I can't remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Angry Joe.
So we got Joe senior out of him, but that's not really
something we can equate to him.
Yeah, Joe is kind of an offensive in that regard.
He just has bad takes.
He ranks movies really badly.
Yeah, Suicide Squad kind of is problem.
Angry Jew.
Oh, yeah, angry.
Angry Jew.
Does that mean he's a see that probably?
Does that put him up to see angry?
Do you look at how long that meme lives?
Really angry?
You do brand-new all the press.
Yeah, so yeah, I'd say they're God's chosen people.
Oh, God.
Next up is movie Bob.
SRS plus.
Oh, the entire chat just says angry Jew.
So you said S right away.
Why do you say that?
The man is a meme.
Like he is a cinema Roberto.
That is the kind of mouth him being a meme isn't enough to
push him that high.
So what else we got?
Yeah, yeah, but he's a prominent meme.
Like he's the biggest meme creator.
Yeah, but just being a meme only give you.
Yeah, like I get it because he is a meme because he thinks
so highly of himself.
He thinks he's the biggest fucking galaxy brain ever.
Now we really have like Christina Hoff Summers on Twitter
recently.
I can't really just like the metanarrative shit.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, the talking fast shit.
All of them is a wolf quit wolf.
We had enough and you know, you know, just several people.
He killed Jay Longboat.
I think as well as well.
I'm fine with him being be because of that.
Like like he has a reputation.
I was gonna say doesn't he fits in with be Patrick Willems
and Jack Sain an extra credit.
Yeah, I'd say he's starting to shape up to be very consistent.
No bullshit.
These are all meme people.
Yeah, but their memes themselves are weak.
Yeah, the memes themselves aren't too fantastic.
But those people my goodness.
All right, brown table.
Ironically, I don't know if I'd sell for anything less than s
plus.
He's a sexual harassment.
Why are we talking about brown table brown tables coming out?
Yeah.
Good rat.
I like the hideous must be giddy as well.
That was that was just right.
Are there any other good brown table memes?
I like to not.
His entire right is the this reminds me of Karl Marx.
Yeah, we had the whole the whole Zootopia thing was because
of him.
How he was a laugh riot.
I love tables videos.
He's all like if he carried on in the exact same quality,
he would start to get to a tonal for me.
Like he would start to get to it.
As it stands probably s plus and he acknowledged as well.
I don't know if I put a rough s plus s I would well,
yeah, because I got to put him above Republican and Wisecrack
and all them.
Yeah, I'd say s plus brown table.
They can do to called sexual harassment and Skillshare.
Someone saying Skillshare did have the way wasn't that closer
look that did the that stuff or my thinking the like the
Russo's would benefit from from some creative writing.
Oh, the nobody comes to my birthday thing.
That's all.
Yeah, that's we laughed our asses off.
Oh my goodness.
So was it Batman is a symbol of Batman.
I remember that quote was it from that's his Batman Dark
Night Rises video.
We did on 50th.
That was really bad too.
Brown table so special.
I love it.
Make more than saying the Don was Brown table.
The Don was Brown table.
What?
Oh, no, no, the Dom was like, I know a lot of people is struggling
to remember, but like I said, I know for a fact that Robot had
created the meme with us and he was on the stream where we covered
I am that Robbie who did the first video on Captain Marvel.
He's the guy who said that I'm like the reason we first covered
it was because he like took a shot of me and we were like,
okay, and then we started doing a couple of Captain Marvel ones
and so the Don originates with I'm that Robbie but it got
bolstered over all the Captain Marvel videos for sure.
Yeah, next up is I don't know this channel is cold, but I know
the video we come from them was the Game of Thrones one where
they were trying to argue that it wasn't too dark and other
things tree sickle.
This is one of the few videos we actually stopped watching
because it was just so fucking worthless.
Yeah, then that probably put some on D.
It was automatic D.
Keep us going.
Next is no man gaming.
D.
I can't remember anything about someone in his video.
No clue.
Yeah, and we actually spoke to him as well.
I can't remember that.
Yeah.
All right.
Now we got Seamus Gorman.
D.
I can't remember what we covered.
Get no Game of Thrones fans.
You don't deserve better.
Was that him Jesus?
That was him.
Yeah, I don't remember that's part of a bad take than a mean.
It was all about stuff him saying like I just want a video
with a million views.
Right.
Yeah.
Next one is Chef Rilla Productions.
I think and he did the video on.
I think it was endgame.
We covered it with critical drinker.
I still want to click whole night to cover.
We didn't talk about it.
Then we got on tangent so many times.
It wasn't even a particularly awful video.
If I think we concluded in that we just it just nothing came.
It's like a C to me.
Do you think it was a D?
Thing is lower than that.
All right.
And I'll finally get tested.
Yes, an IRL.
Yes.
Oh my.
So let's say we got the Christmas music at the end.
Christmas music.
The world is better off with to dare.
Yeah.
I was saying that but no means I don't think there were any
memes.
Well, those I think would easily become me.
He's a he might be B tier.
He's he's a meme for sure.
He's certainly recent.
I think if he was less recent we'd be putting him in D.
Some people are saying D for the pain.
CD maybe see them.
Well, that's yeah, I'm little he hasn't be gone.
Oh, he said walk of shame is sexist.
Oh that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah, even after we explained that both men and women have
to do it.
It's still sex and it's first done to a man.
So it sounds like people saying Lee in the skies.
Yeah.
I'm yeah, it's hmm.
So those get him up to sea.
I don't think that is a sea.
Surely.
I think he hasn't would be sea level.
Yeah, walk of shame is sexist.
Daenerys was better for the world.
Christmas music.
Yes and be gone was a thing that happened a lot the lispy
voice.
I would say that's a B.
I it's quite a repertoire already.
And tell the fact that he himself is a meme.
I do see sympathy for B right now.
See what's the realist is going to say might not age too
well over time.
But yeah, he's a B.
I was at Brown tape.
So I've said I've seen this once or twice in the chat.
Did the Brown table say plot holes don't affect the plot?
Because I saw it before but now that somebody else has said
that.
I don't know so it's reasonable to me.
I don't know.
Sounds like such a Patrick Willems thing to say.
Oh, apparently snowman gaming gave us weird grape and Blessed
Pightman.
I don't think Blessed Pightman came from Jared and Jared
was Blessed Pightman.
Yeah, when he was on stream.
Yeah, when Jared came on.
But my giving might have given us weird grape, but I'm almost
certain.
All right come from his video.
If if it was I think Brown table saying that potholes that
does that elevate Brown table to God like?
Yes, if we've confirmed Brown table did say that if it's if
we can confirm it then yes.
If someone can give us a all right.
Tell you what Brown table will be elevated to God like if
someone can give us a video and a timestamp for when he says
plot holes don't affect the plot.
I'm assuming it's the Dark Knight Rises one.
Yeah, because this is because if just to be certain if there's
some hero in chat you can do that who remembers that we get
this right because this is like Southpaw said yes, I reached
about that.
Remember God like it's no big is a big deal.
We got to make it.
You know, I'm starting to feel like that might.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, but because we just because of the sanctity of the
God like tier.
We have to be sure this is like making someone a saint the
canonization process is really important.
So we got to make sure.
So, let me see.
So look.
It was the Dark Knight Rises video.
He said it.
We got a lot of people saying certainty Southpaw's a video
on it.
He said.
That moment.
Well, I yelled.
The film like a lot of films is layered with the possibilities
like how did Bruce heal is back so quickly.
Are we doing it?
Are we pushing?
I'm currently listening to this.
So if everyone just listen to this like 10 seconds, how do
you get back to Gotham?
Exists but having no relevance to the plot in any way.
So having no relevant plot in any way.
Yeah, that exists but having no relevance to so yeah, you
I can't remember what the fuck is rationale is but he kind
of says the plot holes aren't relevant to the plot in any
way.
Okay.
Yeah, but that but that puts him on God like yeah, I think
that's the level of just graduations Brown table.
Good job.
Brown table.
That's not a level of just because it's bad doesn't mean
it's bad.
Yeah, but we've already decided where he is and he will stay
there forever in our hearts.
So is this it?
This is a meme meme tears.
We've done it.
All right.
So let's so here's what we'll do before we call it.
Let's go to the first couple in each row because those were
made early and now that we've kind of filtered everything
to now that we've got a better relative view of what the
two years are.
Let's see if we need to reevaluate some of the earlier
spots that we gave out.
Are we just redrafting a tier list with no, no, no, we're
just taking the first fit.
No, no, no, we're just the first in the first and a special
lot of these kids the ones we did earlier.
It's okay.
It was a joke.
We calm down.
We power through it.
Yeah, it's power through it.
I was joking.
Yeah, I guess if there's any maybes.
Well, I suppose the best way to do is everyone have a look.
Is there anyone you think shouldn't be in the tears?
Yeah.
I'm hearing I'm hearing snowman should be bumped because
of the weird grape and the first rags Wolf elevator music
argument.
Lot of dealers have so many in there.
Yeah, I don't know.
No one.
I don't know if hmm.
Sarah Z could move down to get rid of the obnoxious gap.
There's a part of me that wonders if there's anyone and
see who should be D.
Well for the memes for.
Weird puppet person.
Who is that weird puppet person?
I heard the action figures.
Oh, Shinobi.
Oh, Shinobi.
Any reason he shouldn't be D.
Was there any I don't think any memes came out of this.
We just we just kind of remember him for the guy that
blew his channel up after we covered him and then he like
came back shortly after.
So that was memorable, but not really Mimi.
You know, I mean.
I swear I remember us naming a meme from him.
Well chat chat.
What what meme is credited to him?
Oh, I'm hearing a lot of people in chat say that Patrick
Willems should be eight here.
I agree.
I'm fine with that because that's up there with Quentin
and it does feel right, but I don't know.
We couldn't reference much from him that we couldn't reference
the same for BTO.
Yeah, so let's do a quick recap.
Patrick Willems you're watching movies wrong.
Spotters don't matter children.
Yeah, Star Wars is Space Wizards intended for children.
I would say that we yeah, he did say that.
Yeah, reviewers don't get paid off a 20 year old white guy
isn't gonna have any oh, yeah, that's right.
I that's a for me that puts a racism puts him into a for
me.
Yeah, totally.
Gets you what a racism gets you up to eight here.
Not to mention he said like green monster is my favorite
and you should go away and you're not my friend if you
don't agree or some shit.
Oh, yeah, he loves the porgs.
Yeah, if you don't what it was if you don't like something
in the last Jedi, I don't want to be your friend or I think
it was porgs wasn't it?
No, he talked about the milk monster.
He said that was his favorite new thing.
Yeah, you went there for that rags.
Yeah, there's a highlight for me.
That's one of the first like explosive efap highlights.
Yeah, me Appa Band of Wolf lost our shit.
Yeah, so he's come.
Yeah.
All right now chat.
I think chat was right on that one.
Yeah.
A tier for Patrick Willems, especially because we forgot
the racism, right?
I'm wondering if we should move anyone down from C to D.
When you look at the C tier, is there anyone there that
you're like, man, I don't remember fuck all about this.
We film joy.
Yeah, I was there.
They didn't call you Marines.
Yeah, yeah, but who actually who like people remember it
when you bring it up, but it's one of those that's a feature
that no one else has.
He wrote something that was awful like, all right.
Yeah, game.
I mean, it's kind of weird.
You got like a whole like efap gameplay.
The first one.
Yeah, that's the thing.
Yeah, that's right.
Efap gameplay played that game.
So that's attributed to him though.
I don't know.
It's like, all right.
Well, if this is an efap villain thing, so by playing his
game when we were playing it, we weren't really critical
of the story that much.
It was way more the mechanics.
Yeah, the writing wasn't the worst part.
It was the fact that we were playing the game.
From what I understand, the writing is dreadful, but that's
not really what the efap gaming episode was focusing on for the
tism, was it?
Yeah.
So, so does he belong in C or D?
Probably D, honestly.
I'm moving him down to D.
Plus it makes her chart look neater.
Didn't Joss Addison have some really good books as well?
Just write with books?
Yeah, I mean, Joseph Anderson is an, is an acclaimed author.
What was it?
What was books called?
Oh, in Stellar Marines.
Oh, yeah.
Does that bump him up?
I don't think that pushes him to S plus.
S plus is pretty good as well.
Yeah, I wouldn't.
Yeah, he's definitely not S plus material, but he's definitely S.
I'm seeing a lot of J's godlike in the chat.
I'm proud, but I don't agree.
Yeah, I think that J's too smart to be godlike.
If that makes sense.
Like J's just going to clip that.
I think J's too self-aware.
Like just right has no fucking clue how pretentious he is and
how much he can't back it up.
But he really thinks that he is like super galaxy brain.
So I think that's part of why he's so, you know, he's so godlike
in terms of meaning.
The brown table is just glorious.
Brown table is like, yeah, we're talking.
He is almost like the like discount tonaled, which is already
like tonal or something.
Brown table son of tonaled.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm happy with this tier list.
I'm pretty happy with this.
Yeah.
Thought it out pretty well.
Someone's just saying tonal should have a higher tier.
Now we don't need to exaggerate it that much.
When you go above godly, there's just no, you know, there's
nothing above that.
Yeah, I suppose we could.
This took way longer than I expected.
I don't know if it's what a shock if we do another tier list
for the quality of those content creators that might take
another feel like this is on stream almost.
Yeah, actually the whole reason we did this is to actually
have a show people beams.
So yeah, we will do that.
We can always come back later and do it.
Yeah, we'll do it again at some point.
We'll actually we'll we'll do all the fab villains in terms
of quality of content.
I mean, I'm prepared.
I just ordered some food.
I'm here for the long run.
Tonal stays in his tonal tier for that, right?
Oh, tonal video.
I don't know.
We'll have to decide that when we get around to it, I guess.
Um, because you know, I don't fucking know.
Tonal transcends any form of quality.
All right, so there's a lot of memes that I've collected
and the way this is gonna have to work is the it's well,
it's the way it normally works, but I may have some difficulties
with how these tabs are working.
I hope nothing goes wrong and that no one notices anything.
I'm just warning you ahead of time that I might need to take
time to do things.
But anyway, let's start with this one is not technically
a meme, but I think we all need to be aware of it.
So Chuck Tingle is the guy who writes the the books that
Professor Tospot often reads excerpts from and apparently
did an AMA and someone asked have you heard of Professor
Tospot's dramatic reading of some of your books on eFap
podcast is great.
I believe he read out your gay donuts and unicorn books.
He said no, I have not but it sounds like this is a moment
that brought joy to Betty.
So I think it's probably a very good way and I'm glad to hear
about it.
I hope everyone had fun.
I thank you so much for telling me about this.
You've made my timeline a little bit brighter today.
That is very kind.
Thank you, bud.
Really fucking doesn't use punctuation.
Does he?
No notice to capitalize the eyes, but that's fine.
Who needs to do that?
We just had like a really wholesome comments like fucking
punctuation piece of shit.
It's just odd to see it from an author, you know,
his books are so eloquently written as well.
Is this really him?
So someone said where's the loud soup in reference to his
noticing that his fucking audio symbol was on the the thing
and he said it was a microphone side.
I figured out how to hide it.
I'm surprised that the Dubbies on eFap don't know what it
is. It's not a microphone side.
You reach out.
Speaker that's a big old whoosh.
First off, it's a yeah, it's a speaker.
We obviously fucking know.
It looks like loud soup on Vader's forehead.
It's hilarious.
We've loved covering your stupid video.
It was amazing.
Give us more loud soup, please.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, so on to memes.
I'm going to try and I was going to say try and do this fast,
but no, no, it'll just take as long as it takes.
Well, I'll involve the only gax.
Am I the only person who knows what gax is or I'm aware of
what gax is because of that H Pomega video.
Wasn't there an old energy drink that had like a lizard like
Sobey or something like that?
Yeah, it was Sobey.
There was yeah, yeah, yeah.
It wasn't really an energy drink though.
I think Sobey was just a I think it was just like a type
of juice.
I don't think I ever drank that but I did play gax on Gameboy
at one point and turn on the playstation.
Looked like that's what the original cover looked like.
Yes, I never played that game did not age well at fucking
all. All right.
It doesn't look good for a look good and he's got like shit
loads of references that were like 90s to like 90s celebrities
and it's just please stop.
Please stop talking right now.
I don't know which game this is.
I'm sure chat will know but apparently there was a thing
called the molar in it neat.
It looks really small.
As soon as you're supposed to zoom in idiot.
No, as in the character looks really small compared to the
table.
Zoom in on the character idiot.
Fucking idiot a lot of these are going to be things that
I show and I even read out and I wonder how this happened.
There are two premises inside of you one is a massive
the other one is a massive you are a massive.
Okay.
Yeah, I can't remember the context is these ones can go
back a long way.
So the screen we don't appreciate them.
Okay, they're wonderful.
Now for anyone who's seen kick-ass to will understand
this meme.
I like it.
I totally forgot there's a second one and most people forgot
this is like a one.
Is this any good?
I hate probably not.
All right.
I hated it first time but I enjoyed it second.
But you know, it's fine.
Oh look, it's a reference to when Jay was criticismed.
Congratulations, you're being critiqued.
Do not resist.
I thought it was pretty funny me watching Lord of the Rings
after Game of Thrones season 8 and the Last Jedi my friends
you bow to no one logical character progression three
dimensional characters consistent message and themes
satisfying ending those four were murdered across several
other pieces of media you see it was horrible.
Yes.
Jay won't get this one.
I'm not sure what this one rags.
What is this?
What is the Grievous be?
Why do I forgot the fucking the drawings?
Oh, right.
That was but I'm wondering what doggo I probably called
him McNuggers at some point.
Chicken McNuggers.
I'll have some chicken McNuggers.
That's a very graphic image.
That's terrifying in its own way in prehistoric times
referred to him as the we managed to imprison him in the
Philippines Goliath has moved Goliath has chosen cynic
snacks next target eyes on Goliath.
That's a haunting picture of snacks.
Yeah, that's cold.
Like this is good shit.
Her we showed this before I think there's been a few
Singapore Singapore.
So Mel you'll get this because you watched it recently
Batman 89.
When he gets his revolver turns out to be a lot longer
than expected and he fires the long at bad.
That's good.
That's applicable to the oh, yeah, we watched it.
So, you know, this will be a reference for fap gaming for
Steve who's definitely not an alien.
I promise I won't get political guys.
What bias cat later?
Me Mel actually own those t-shirts now.
I'm wearing it right now.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I'm gonna wear it tomorrow as well on stream.
If you want to see it live.
Whoa, whoa.
So depiction of the fap war ongoing.
Why am I a little horse?
Jim just asked what's the point of playing kotmoto player
if everyone is just gonna camp of a shotgun.
Not yet, right?
I think that this is quite a good meme.
I appreciate.
It's funny cuz it's true.
It's a fact of life.
You should never ignore it.
This is from a multi python sketch.
This character was assassinated.
His actions big.
No sense.
No see Luke was a Jedi.
There's another one of them but it's different things for you.
We need to watch some Monty Python.
They haven't watched any Monty Python.
By the way, I want to I want to give a props to the person
who made that meme for doing Luke behind and inside of the
cage.
Oh, yeah, cut the actual pieces.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you had to mask each individual bar.
So congrats for the patience.
Yeah, so that's I appreciate the effort.
That must have been frustrating writing TLJ.
Oh, definitely.
And who wrote this with the seagull beep?
Who wrote?
Going on this.
Look at this.
There's so many kick J memes that are going to be coming
across as one of my kicking boots.
I love the implication.
Wait is oh, no, no, no, it's not.
I thought that the Isle of Man thing was actually there.
It does look like it belongs.
It's lighting on.
It's pretty good.
Mm-hmm.
It actually got me as soon as I zoomed in and realized.
Oh, okay.
Oh, is this a thing up in the Isle of Man that they have?
Decent tits in that picture as well.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, there's a lot to unpack with this one.
Freudian.
An Aristotle thing.
They just bat-woven at the corner.
We're going to watch bad women so soon.
Objective facts.
Just swap those little demons away and you're good.
He's talking to Quinton and H-Baba guy.
I don't think you understand.
Like Gloob.
I gotcha.
H-Baba guy.
I'm sure of the narrative here.
Does Quinton betray somebody or is he saying he's going to
defend H-Baba guy?
He's going to back him up.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't mind just being like a Hydra thing.
That's fine with me.
I'll be right back.
I quite like this.
Bing bong.
I mean, it's just a photo someone took, okay?
It's realistic.
I don't know.
Those words were just there.
Is this what looks to be a few long men?
A few long men.
But also recommend a few good men.
It's a good film.
It's quite a haunting image.
A few long men.
Scribes.
What is clearly an event of sorts.
Arguably terrifying.
Like one of them is just the chat.
Our chat is good enough to be a character in a lot of memes.
Oh, definitely.
So this is Zootopia and the Sloth.
Definitely Sloth.
May say fuck.
That's hilarious because he does at least say it once the rest are bleeped.
This is one of those ones where I'm like fuck.
What's the context?
Pixels.
Pixel fucking.
Oh, yeah.
Pixel fucking.
It literally says it in the URL.
Oh, you're right.
I'm retarded.
Well, this is pixel.
Fuck.
That's that's a far cry from pixel fucking.
Yeah, I'm glad you back me up rags.
High five.
I'm not.
I'm kind of with you on this one.
I'm glad you back me up man.
Kind of with you.
I have food.
I quite quite like this.
Funny.
I wonder if they came across that by accident or that's what they made them think of.
They're like, oh, that's definitely that, you know.
This is an actual poster and people just posted.
They want us to comment on the fact that it's described as a massive finale.
You know, and I guess they're really gunning for the whole women part of it.
Oh, that was the best shot they had for several costumes at once.
I suppose it is.
It's a nice looking shot.
Well, I mean, it's good for showing costumes as well.
I guess it's just that there must have been a lot of options for that.
I don't know, but we'll see.
We'll be interested to see what Oscars are won for who.
This is a very important meme.
I think a lot of people will appreciate.
I love it.
That would hurt.
That is that is good.
Red right there.
I'm sitting there thinking I'm just looking at thinking I would not be brave enough to sit there.
No, that's my problem with this image.
Epic Epic Epic Epic.
Celestial.
Nefap original.
A savior has dawned.
Amazon Prime.
This is one of I think two memes of like apparently there's like a long version of Meowth that came out for Pokemon.
I don't know what's going on there.
But yeah, apparently there's a Meowth is long now.
Meowth damn.
Long Meowth good.
And this is the boys reference.
You got the fan base being like lately some of you have been a little out of sorts erratic for solo.
Unreliable for Force Awakens.
Don't worry.
Sloppy for the Last Jedi.
Not you though.
You've been great Vader comics.
I've not read Vader comics, but I'm a man.
Mola Prime spook option.
I like it shit.
Both of the icons.
It works.
So I guess this is spook option.
Local military police in Brazil using Buffaloes to patrol.
Cribidals and that looks cool as fuck.
It is actually kind of cool.
Those there.
They're pretty they're pretty neat looking man.
We won't fuck with them.
Nope.
Oh, this is the other version of that meme.
I guess.
She's dead.
No, she's not dead.
She's resting.
Like her eyes are close.
Yeah.
So the original Simpsons thing for this is Bart is making fun of a
show for getting the knots wrong.
I think because he's become a Boy Scout and he's getting good at
it and he's like they're getting the rots and accurate the knots
Iraq it and I'm homeless.
No, I think Lisa says they don't have to be realistic all the
time and then Homer walks by in the background while he's
sitting on the sofa in the room because it's just good shit.
You got Ryan Johnson doesn't know squat.
Luke wouldn't try to kill his nephew in his own sleep.
Luke would have been trying to save Ben just like he did with
Anakin return the Jedi.
Oh long man.
This is just a movie about space Wizards for children.
They just see Ryan walking past in the background while he's
there to catch this Ryan subverting expectations.
It's good shit.
I love Simpsons references.
So we got a big idiots.
He was a mathematician and philosopher.
Oh, yeah.
Someone just to ultimately look up to I love the fact that
someone saw this and thought I don't have to do I know what
I have to do.
Delicious things done, right?
Right.
I like these ones.
So everyone's in their day-to-day and they like oh,
right.
Oh food.
I have been drawn here for a purpose.
Oh now we got a what makes good rat in a classroom obviously.
He's really enjoying this lesson.
I mean, you know, we all need to learn about this.
Yeah, I'm thrilled.
So this is definitely any fat meme.
But now I'm what was what am I missing?
That's Arkansas.
That's the state of Arkansas.
It's stopping you from counting to 55.
It's 253 54 54.
So it's 54 twice from counting 54 five, right?
Why?
Was this like a fat 55?
I don't know.
I named I named the episodes wrong.
I think on I think I named 250 fours and I had to change it to 55.
But then I don't understand the rest.
Okay.
All right.
Check the code this number of states.
We did two episode 54.
But then what's with Arkansas?
All we can do I don't I don't understand someone just said
that's Wisconsin.
Fuck off.
I actually don't know what this meme is.
Uh, this may be a road road map to get this one here.
Maybe it's because I was like an I'm from Arkansas and even I know something
something maybe hard to count.
Maybe he couldn't draw a dog and represented rags.
This was a good place.
You guys are talking about is that it?
Yeah, we know it's about me, but I just I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know that this one is me.
All right.
We tried our best.
I like getting sent like images of people watching efap.
There's a couple of them in the in here, but uh, it's one of these got a
little oh wait, I think I might have shown this one because I remember
saying like rip all of those franchises that he's got stuff for outside
of years.
The walls if tears is right now.
Yeah, gears are fine.
Yours is fine.
Gears.
Five is fine.
They're in fallout though.
Rip.
Yeah, Terminator fallout.
And the efap franchise is going okay.
So yeah, we're doing great.
Still strong.
How many how many how many TV series can say that they made it to episode
60 and they're still going strong.
Oh, no.
Any adventure they just simply aren't prepared.
That was that was me when I first watched a movie about video and
he started talking.
It's like stop stop.
Oh, I defeat this.
This is um, the dangers of often I guess.
I haven't seen this movie, but apparently that's a thing that happens.
I don't know.
That's Christopher Lee.
No, I was fucking making a joke idiot.
Also this.
Hers.
And the dawn survived.
So it's all good.
So as long as you've seen the shining this works just fine.
Forever and ever.
Long man bad times bestseller long man bad, but I'm not sure that's
inherently much of a bad thing.
Oh, Quintonio.
Next up we got.
This was the dawn of bad takes us got joker.
That's not boring.
Spaceballs is boring.
Jay, do you think you'll be I think we got a I think I was right.
Someone in chat is saying I'm from Arkansas and even I can count
as something that I said, so that's probably what that means for.
Okay.
See, I remember.
I remember someone bringing up something about galaxy quest as
well after I wasn't here.
Oh, I want to confirm that.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Oh, I want to confirm that I have seen galaxy quest and it's much
better than spaceballs.
I love galaxy.
I thought you were there for that because I remember mentioning
like I love galaxy quest, but I also love spaceballs.
So I swear it happened when I wasn't there, but I can't be certain.
So maybe I just repeated myself.
I don't know.
This one's called quinted underscore bid.
Fire not quite.
It's got a load up for us.
This one.
Mm-hmm.
It's slow for me.
Oh facts and walk instructor.
I love that.
He's so neutral.
He's just like damn burning.
I do not like this.
So this is in reference to the gray blobs.
There is an episode of paleo appearance that represents it.
We said the most inoffensive thing you could have is a storyline
with just everyone's gray blobs.
Yeah, apparently we went the first to come up with that.
So I think this was when we were discussing how about starter
Pokemon and this is already a meme that exists and apparently
like I don't know cuz I don't know the fuck all about Pokemon
really, but apparently like the other three do actually suck
more than Bulbasaur.
Is this is this a true?
It's almost like I said it for a reason.
Oh, well, I mean, I don't I already made it clear.
I don't care about their actual power levels.
I just don't want to play the retard.
Venus looks like no be sold man couldn't like the compare
that to Blastoise and Charizard like oh, but a lot of people
just assume because of the element the you know, the type
that they are that oh Bulbasaur must be the worst.
He's just grass type.
He's like, oh, yeah, I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't go that far because I don't know fuck all about
Pokemon in like late stage and stuff.
Like I yeah, I was just saying.
Makes an incoherent his me statement consisting of objective
fallacy lashing out when their feelings the channel is
generally storming on opposition throwing insults ignoring
contextual information of bringing political agendas into
a conversation about media when unnecessary.
I'm like hmm and then Isle of man.
I'm sorry.
Splitting mask there is disturbing.
It is kind of that is actually kind of strange creepy tongue.
Oh God.
So for those who have seen Lord of the rigs, no matter what
comes through that gate, you will stand your ground movie
Bob run.
Also, if they're not displaying on discord, you just got to
click them as in those being annoying or just get my stream
open, I guess.
That's what I'm doing.
There's this wonderful new movie coming out starring
Dishonored Wolf Anton look called.
Hello all my onwards.
Holy shit.
I'm on the verb you are.
I really like the the rhino and the hello all my onwards.
I really like that.
Goliath coming soon.
I was a massive didn't cut my pizza faggots.
Oh my God.
Use scissors or a pizza cutter.
Oh, it's Starkiller base in the background as well.
You have even knives.
What is Starkiller base?
Well, how about that?
Knives are worse for cutting pizza than scissors or pizza
cutter.
Knives are worse than a scissors.
Wait, sorry.
What if you want to cut pizza?
Scissors are better than a knife.
Stuck your opinion.
Yes.
Ahoy matey.
I love pirates.
Pirates.
I guess that's a yeah.
Pirates.
Okay.
Hi, matey.
Hey.
Yay.
I'll just let anyone else realize the hilarity and
sument from that.
It's not load like it takes so like these aren't loading.
I got a middle mouse on the links.
Are you are you are you putting links into the chat or are
you putting the image?
Are you pasting the image or are you pasting the link?
I'm doing the exact same thing.
I don't want to pop them up because to see each one of them
I have to click them.
So they open up in a browser.
I imagine it could be related to the fact that there's so
many now.
Maybe but I'm just doing the same thing.
I've been doing the whole time.
But yeah, so in a straight line at full speed the resilient
class could be faster than a tie.
FO space superiority fighter.
Here's the thing.
There is no fucking way it wouldn't.
Well, let's see.
Yeah, just okay.
So for those who aren't sure of what's happening, the joke
is that they say that anything that's small smaller is going
to go faster.
Like they just but this is space.
There is no wind resistance.
There is no atmosphere and look at the big fuck-off engines
on the back of that.
I mean, we don't even go by that rule.
If we don't just say it's smaller there for faster.
Yeah, like we don't go that way.
Have you ever seen something small and stationary?
I don't think you have.
Yeah.
Checkmate atheists.
Snails don't exist.
No snails.
Yeah, so like obviously this isn't this is from like a wiki
or something, but it's not just frustrating.
How stupid TLJ is, but you know.
Yeah, see that's just a jpeg image.
So that should just show up, but it's not.
I don't know why.
Some of them are trying to try to just copy paste the image
and see if it comes up.
Okay, it could almost be worth just opening.
I mean, it's the same thing.
Anyway, it's because there are too many images in the chat.
It could be worth opening a new chat at that point that we'd
have to start a new call, right?
I guess but is that you could still you could still talk to
each other on a call but be looking at the text because it
displays based on whatever's currently on discord.
So yeah, I mean I'll start a new call.
All right, it's not a big deal.
We just click on them.
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay.
All right, then so yeah, when you bring me out, can you
introduce me as the dawn?
That's a good one.
Yes.
I like that.
This one's terrifying.
Oh, no.
I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Why me?
Me and Jay paying full attention.
Of course.
I don't like the poo poo.
We see we've been looking away from it.
Well, yeah, I guess both of us are but I think we're on board.
We're just sort of, you know, we're like, we're looking knowingly
into the camera.
We knew that someone was taking a photo of it and that's that's
what's wonderful about it.
There's a lot of checkered shirts there.
The new in thing.
No.
Photoshop job.
There's another one of those words where it's just like so
that speaks for itself.
It's actually a couple of I love man is very successful.
Are you happy about that?
Jay?
Yeah, that's what I preferred me.
Yes.
Beautiful.
I've not seen the source for this but the thing is I do kind
of care about both themes and subjectivity just not when
they used for what they used for.
If you catch if you if you pick up what I'm putting down agreement.
Yes, agreements agreement.
Remember this?
Yeah.
Super chat says the rooster.
Do this is something that's happened since the dawn of time.
It's a very beautiful.
We're just continuing a long human tradition.
I didn't know this was a thing.
One day they will do this up the people of the future.
I love man shoes.
Oh my god.
Draw feet on your shoes.
It helps you run faster.
True.
Oh, yeah, kind of like the whole Reebok pumps thing back in the day.
Yeah, it's like why it's why a lot of race cars have stripes on them.
How rags gonna feel about this?
Rags and molar go to Mars.
He's definitely the woman.
I'm a I'm a fit ship.
Damn tits and rags and molar go to Mars.
I like it.
The dawn presents tales from the efap by Bill Barr.
Oh, yeah.
Remember when bag tins.
It was you sent a link to Gmail Gmail.
It's a link to Gmail.
What the fuck?
Why have you linked us Gmail?
That's a wrong link.
Oh, it's a male attachment.
Oh, well for this one.
You can just pull up the stream.
I guess I don't know how to make it stop.
Is that saying the Aiden one?
Yeah.
So when we told her about what Quinton said and she sort of just died.
Sequels on your sequel if you interpret it that way.
Classic Quinton.
It's insane.
Yes, it is.
That's one of those quotes where the more you think about it, the more you just
Yeah.
I forgot when we were doing this.
I think we forgot to mention that when we're doing the tier list.
It's only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Oh, yeah.
That would be one.
It probably doesn't change his rankings.
But yes, I agree.
Yeah.
I like this one though.
I do too.
Protect attack.
Well, that one actually showed up as well.
I know that thing.
That really is that that picture that one for whoever that was who made that
the fucking three legs.
Oh, that's terrifying, man.
I don't think so.
Why is that the symbol of a nation?
I don't know.
I don't even know.
Bainspider adopted the web.
I was.
Ordered by it.
This is the web.
Oh, man.
Being reminded of that stream is great.
Oh, that was such a crazy good stream.
More checking the spider milk to learn the runtime of the next event.
24 hours.
I love pirates.
Little cosplay.
Wait, isn't that like the pirate from like Spongebob or something?
Possibly.
Yeah.
It's because the ship is its own thing.
Then Banjo Kazooie is and must be that and Tonal's face.
I like how jagged totals faces.
It's wonderful.
The suit will be perfect when it fits a critic.
Oh, no, I'm not wearing that weirdly.
Good Photoshop.
I was going to say it fits.
Well, the color scheme fits pretty well to you.
No, it's like you were made for this role.
Well, so sorry.
It made sense to cover Batwoman, I guess.
Wait, what's the order for this?
It goes to figure it out.
I think it's right to left because it's a weep.
Yeah.
If you want to leave that is over.
That's what happens when he fabs over.
You don't know.
That's when he that begins.
Oh, yeah, very applicable for the streams.
That is that.
Yeah, that works really well.
Show this one already.
Um, did we show I think we showed this one big.
It is.
Yeah, I think so.
Still good though.
Oh, of course.
I've not seen this one.
Didn't turn off my heater just a second.
Imagine such a scene over silly stage play for children or
soothe.
They are going beyond nitpicking for the tale of their own
sake and they are in fact murdering the very concept of
culture.
A fellow countryman handeth me the hemlock if thou will.
There's a guy in the background say hi rags.
Move the hands like hey.
Silence chess cup wizard.
Fucking boring.
I like the guy who's just fucking crying on the wall.
You think they would have attached a quote to that?
Tismy people rejected his message.
The last Jedi is objectively bad.
Shut up.
They hated what he told them to do.
Shut up.
So the gender wizard before I change you look like a female
you may choose what female you look like.
You have two choices.
You can either look like a random woman of my choosing
or you can look like Brie Lawson.
Who shall you choose?
How are our response?
I think we put a wizard hat on the rest.
Monday Night Raw.
This is like.
This is almost worth this is almost this is actually worth
posting to surreal vibes.
The gender wizard.
Super.
Oh wow.
That's a big one.
Oh, yeah, we got we got a lot to look at here.
Oh, yeah, it's at the bottom left.
Fucking did he come?
I'll wait to the left.
I'll talk to you.
I'm a snake.
More men.
Who's in Samus's mask?
Samus Samus or Samus Samus Samus who's in Samus's mask?
Oh, yeah, it's really small, isn't it?
Oh, gee, I can make it out.
Yeah, I don't know who that is.
I've got the spider.
Kathleen, Kendi, Ryan, Johnson.
I would play this game.
Patrick.
Joseph.
It's a great shad face.
They've chosen for that.
I'm guessing that's me as Peach.
Ice Climbers are, of course, Eric and Jack Sain that woman is
Bayonetta.
Oh, no.
Theo's young link.
Southpaw's Ryu.
Doomcock is, I guess that's Gannett.
Wolf is Wolf.
Ike is.
That guy.
Oh, FBI is.
I think Film Bob is Sonic, right?
I think that's yeah.
Film, film, film, bro.
Film bro.
I like Joseph Anderson's Ridley.
Wolf is Wolf.
Wolf is Wolf, yeah.
Jay Longbone is the Inkling.
I'm using a long sword.
Yeah, it says long.
It makes sense that Joseph Anderson's Ridley and Martha's
Shad.
Mahler is Quinton's Bowser.
Robot head is Mega Man.
That makes sense.
Some of these are pretty good.
Yeah.
I like it.
Where's Nerdrotic and Drinker?
I don't know.
Terrible castle.
Oh, God.
Karl Marx is leading the Pikmin NPCs.
In the middle right beneath Jay.
Oh, and the cosmic chicken is in the heart.
Of it all.
There he is.
I see him.
Oh, yeah, the cosmic chicken.
I love it.
That's a good one.
I like that.
Yeah, I like how they weren't just randomly posted on.
They are.
There is some sense to them.
I like the Shad meme.
This is pretty referential.
Yeah, everyone was like, Yasm was just.
This is good.
I like this.
I know a lot of people in chat were mentioning something pretty
similar to this.
Chat is a character again.
Why is everyone spelling it like that?
Did we do something?
Was this something about that that we said?
I don't remember.
So not so great debate.
I can believe I spelled it again.
Say he's old again.
I dare you.
I double-dang motherfucker.
See, he's old one.
God damn tell.
Poor Wolf.
Dealing with that.
This is apparently a character.
Something from Code Vein.
Everyone's like, Oh my God, it's you.
You're also in Fortnite by that logic.
Oh, no.
I don't like the original stuff.
This is.
That's not the only one I've seen.
What makes it hella funny is a thing.
I think like the same logo and everything, but a poster.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It was like the same logo and everything, but a poster.
Pretty decent.
Like this could be used for stuff like a graphic.
Pretty cool.
It's the Buffy form.
Oh, yeah.
Slap it over stuff really easy.
Good tisms.
I think Raw would like this one if you were here.
Oh, no.
Now that I keep behind that.
That seems about right.
Mm hmm.
I believe it.
Shamejerker doesn't throw it off a roof.
Subjective.
Oh, that's a that's transparent too.
Yeah, we can.
It could be used for some stuff.
I think so.
How many times do you have to teach this lesson old man?
It's a yes, it's legacy.
I suppose.
Yes, it's legacy.
So this is for the horizon for got themselves an efap car
that has a manual rags bringing in theotree on it.
Theotree, I guess.
Yeah, looking sexy.
What will happen in the efap car?
Now, it's kind of nifty.
You could put like custom stickers and stuff.
Wait, is that?
Oh, that's a game.
Yes.
It's not real car.
It took me a second.
You're like, is someone actually go back to their fucking car?
And then you're like, oh, there's a big logo that says Forza Horizon 4.
It's also the letter 6 on the efap.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
The nyazim was truly Major Lee in disguise or he was he was someone in disguise.
We're sure about it.
But another movie Bob killing guests, maybe.
Stop it.
Jay, you'll appreciate this.
Clorums.
I don't know.
There's no context to that.
It's just me as a dude.
I mean, there's enough for them to work with.
I can say it's a good part.
It's quality pun.
So I love the idea that someone thought I have to make this.
You woke up one morning.
Jayode.
Yes.
Give this to Major Lee.
I like the Ros Felicitad to the Sun God thing.
It's it's scared node.
Oh my god.
This is another depiction of efap and it's in an older state.
Obviously that we're doing the modern version.
Chats there.
Pull the beams from shit.
Oh, that's good.
I like that one.
It's pretty funny.
Waskley wax.
Wags.
Stupid squeaky chair.
Fuck.
By the way, this is absolutely how real shotguns work.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
That's a fucking map Strav reference.
I don't know what that means.
That's that was okay.
There was a day of Minecraft YouTubers and this is like the one fucking.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
I'm so happy.
This is in here.
What does it mean?
Yeah, the reference is that it's just like the sign saying fucking liar is the reference, but oh.
That's it.
Yeah.
I'm disappointed.
Yeah.
You find again.
I want to see people.
I just I was surprised to see it.
All right.
To lose friends and alienate people.
Got Quinton reviews.
Molotiero.
Contra points.
Rags sex doll bread to PewDiePie.
His internet historian.
Jay Longbone.
I'm a skeptic turkey.
Tom Ben.
Whoa.
I fucking hate everyone.
That's everyone's a dots.
Right.
They didn't do anything with the piglet.
I haven't seen them friends.
That's weird.
I look weird as to talk about it.
Yeah, that it who is like on Quinton's team exactly who's like his buddy now.
I mean Quinton's on there.
That's good enough for him.
I'm sure.
That's good enough.
Remember when you made the comment right about him seeming to like be blasting her with his staff.
He does.
He does.
He did look like that.
Yeah.
That's such a well-chosen picture of Ray too.
Yeah.
I'm so cold.
So cold.
I like this a lot.
Sonic says if you're ever bored, punch an orphan.
What are they gonna do?
Tell their parents.
Thanks Sonic.
Sonic knows us up.
You did it.
Yet another accurate meme.
I'll sing a poor build was better off with today.
I see this as an absolute.
Rags you've been spotted in a store.
Put on some weight and you're wearing a little I'm sure they're cold.
Is it like a shawl or a tie thing?
It's not necktie.
Swapping out accessories.
It's like a headscarf.
Yeah, for that is that no, so that's like that's you.
Well, somebody who can someone who can speak that someone tell us what that means.
Because I don't even know what language that is.
I'm going to assume Japanese or some Japanese font.
It's a kerchief.
Is that an ascot?
An kerchief.
An ascot or like a round.
That's what Freddie wears.
Babushka.
Someone's saying I can vote twice.
So that's true.
So neckerchief.
It could be just worn up top.
Yeah, someone said Japanese.
That's cool.
But what does it say?
Does anyone speak Asian?
The Church of the toxic brood.
We got James Moore the Pope, the richest defabber of the toxic brood.
Got the creamy sheaf Palpatine, the revered historian.
Beowyn, the skilled artist.
Veteran verbal terrorists and newcomer hate mongers.
The kinds of deep themes that the mere words cannot.
Meme repository, the missionary.
His video is filled with Tism reaching far and wide telling the massive history of the toxic brood.
Oof Oof, protector of orphans.
He definitely loves as much as his biological children.
Has low bode density submits to the apex orphan incapable of being gay.
Allegedly doesn't own their own blood.
Got left behind.
Rather controversial revisionary.
AR the less controversial opposition.
Salad King Ras, noble successor and Jared Genesis, the unfortunate traitor.
I think that fits.
I think that works.
I think that works.
This is beautiful.
This one.
Someone's caught someone saying it's called moon.
Runic.
If so, that's interesting.
Maybe it's okay for him to get.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
The geode wings.
Oh my goodness.
No.
Look is a national treasure.
I agree 100%.
I had the pirate hat.
This is getting weird now because the tabs don't actually have like I can't choose them myself.
I have to use the shortcut.
That's some good rat.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, so much Photoshop work.
It's done.
What is this?
I don't know the source like thing knowing the source would help.
Who could be the alien Vader who has been tagged with like all the alien things.
One of the best gifts I ever got was drugs.
I'm in danger.
Other use of my picture of you.
Everyone should watch E5 Gaming 4.
It was good shit.
Oh, it was funny.
Yes, someone found this book jazz rags and blues.
Oh, by the way, I guess I you could put this on stream.
Give me just a second here.
When I saw that originally, I thought it was very very interesting.
That somebody had brought that up because.
That's pretty good.
It's not.
It's better than I can do.
Yeah, that's what I mean by it's not.
I think that's an absolute win-win process.
Yeah, well, that's that's my copy.
That's why you have a vision of that.
I do.
I actually I actually have that book and I used it extensively when I was going
through when I was learning piano.
That's why when I saw that meme, I had to do like a double take because I I know that
cover so well.
You sure that they didn't rip that off your name from the future when they made
I don't know.
I couldn't even say now the terminators went back in time to plant this into our home.
Do you have a green carpet?
Huh?
You have a green carpet?
Not at my house.
It says my my parents house.
That's where I grew up.
It's actually works.
It works with the room.
It's like a like a dark green.
That's a pretty cool shit.
And then it's not how acronyms work.
No, but it's you get what they're doing.
You get it.
It's cool.
Racist.
Yeah, I can you know.
We get a silver still good.
Oh Jared.
So we have one of these before this is a different version of the long man body
pillow.
I think.
Oh and for the for the Chaske about Laura.
Yes.
I do know how to play piano.
Pretty good.
I like the long man.
This is another long man with you.
This is another long man with me.
And there's you.
Whoa.
Thing.
That's like the Meowth thingy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's like I said, there's more than one of them.
Meowth being long is a thing and I'm okay with that.
I've summoned Meowth.
Oh my god.
Pretty much definitive proof that Star Wars ripped off.
Robocop part Sith Lord part.
Robon Forcer all pussy ass.
He's got soup in his hand.
Robocop the future of my cost.
That is good.
So I can't just loud soup.
It's just a funny combination of words.
Not normally the adjective you use to describe soup.
This is another efap gaming for inside me.
It's like one of my top five favorite memes.
Apparently in Borderlands you can come across badass Goliath.
Oh, yeah, though.
I think there must be some kind of clone or shrunken vision
because Goliath isn't that puny, you know.
Yeah, it's kind of insulting, but you know, you know, fair enough.
You're simply named after the great Goliath.
One of the children.
Wagsies.
I'm hunting wags.
They've gone through all of the individual season things to replace
with wags.
Of course.
Yeah, that's just that's it.
Another efap gaming for reference.
Speaking of my head dirty here.
The not so great debate part two 2019 colorized.
It was an ordeal to say the least.
Oh, it's something else.
I like how he didn't even say that, but well, it didn't say that.
It's just the font was so tizzly.
Yeah, what would you have us do it?
I'm sorry.
It's like a rat.
Make millions.
It says showtism.
I mean, yeah, I'd watch it.
I don't know.
I'm just saying it's past for me.
You guys might be aware of this.
This meme got sent around.
Where it's well.
Oh, yeah, and they've just replaced it.
So people who don't know it's just like if a guy says that can to
bite didn't serve a purpose, then they probably don't understand
a plot and theme work.
If they say that Holders plan was like just nonsense all of it,
then they probably have a problem with men facing consequences
for their actions.
And then if they say and I love the J's on you.
The Rose Tico character was useless and poorly acted.
They racist and probably hate women.
This this thing.
No, just just imagine unironically thinking like that.
Yeah, that's what's so that's what's so weird.
There are people who unironically like Batwoman and who parrot stuff
like this around as if it's yeah, really a thing like they believe it.
It's like, oh, you don't like Rose Tico?
Yeah, probably a racist who hates women.
You don't like a character in a movie and that's all that's all they
need.
They added a fifth panel.
The sad face like oh man.
What is it wrong with me?
Oh, no.
I'm gonna have all of the flags.
So that's not actually the end of the meme images, but we're getting
close.
Oh, yeah, I know.
I'm actually like it's all right.
Next portion.
That was one of the portions.
Jeb and angry Jew.
We had a lot.
We all we do.
Yeah, Jenny's video got fucking ignored several times for just
better things.
Angry Joe and you know, that stuff.
That's good.
I mean, I can't say this meme is accurate, but I still appreciate
the effort.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now, Jeb is my best friend.
We have both.
I think Jeb and the dawn can work together.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now, Jeb is my best.
Jeb is pretty awesome though.
What a powerful tech team.
Lord of the faps return of the Alpha.
These are all specific.
I guess the previous.
Yeah, probably yesterday.
Yeah, definitely this one.
Zack Snyder, the Guardians of the Ghoul because it would be
done.
You're right.
Yeah, that guy.
What was it?
Insidious or hmm?
Yeah, the demon bugle in that movie.
I forgot.
I didn't even I didn't even think about it.
But yeah, that's the name of the demon guy from that one movie.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I haven't seen it actually so sinister is the name of
it sinister.
Yeah.
Oh, I've heard of that.
That's the one with Ethan is Ethan Hawke was in there.
I'm not sure he like lives in images and stuff like that
and he eats children or something.
Oh, well, you know, I love this.
This is great.
Oh, no.
Let's start a chat.
Wait, what is the little guy?
It's uncompetitive.
I think because he has an Xbox avatar.
Okay.
I like how accurate this is.
Well, that's from Trollhunter.
That's from Shrek.
That's from Shrek, not Trollhunter.
That's Ogrehunter, if anything.
Do the wrong.
This is a reference to Cyberpunk.
That's a reference to the Dawn.
True.
It's Trollhunter.
Dude, it's a crossover.
It's a reference to Trollhunter.
Why not a Trollhunter?
I like that we had two of these.
Got to have bad takes with us.
They are very bad takes.
I can't believe that Jenny's was worse than movie box.
Yeah, it was just awful.
It's interesting how everything she said was wrong.
She's sort of, I think she gets away with a lot of really
heinous statements because of how the framing of all of it
is.
Just say it's just a girl sitting down talking about a
movie she saw.
What's so wrong with that?
Why are you criticizing her?
Poor, you're all talking about movies.
So you got Jenny Nicholson.
Insert film here thinks it's more deep and profound than
actually is, complete with pointless filler that doesn't
add anything to the overall story.
Wolfmolar and Wasp.
Oh my, this one looks interesting.
How many eFabs have we gone without memes?
Smaller, about four.
Oh god, I can't read it.
It just says beeb overload.
Oh, it's super tiny as well.
Yeah, it's just a bad guy.
I saw this the other day and it's it's much better quality.
Is it on the eFAT on the Discord?
Maybe I yeah, I must have copied it.
You're actually like grab the thumbnail or something.
Must have been, yeah.
But I mean, I still understand.
It's a very good meme though, I like it.
The trouble with memes is that they're no trouble at all.
That is a true.
Um, what?
I don't get it.
Oh, it's a tank.
It's a tank.
There's no way you could lift up a tank.
Oh god, it's back-to-back wartime style ones.
Every one of you have goes live.
I'm not sure what's happening in this image that you're trying to say
everyone goes fucking nuts.
They're racing to watch the eFATs.
The tank is no longer affected by gravity.
Also that realistic shot and killed 404.
Shot and wounded 1960 total shot 2364 total homicides 440.
Yeah, that's from the website that tracks that I was using for
crime statistics yesterday.
You didn't get it.
Oh, Jeb.
Jeb.
This is a Futurama reference.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the Agri-Dulb.
I guess that's where eFAT lives.
It's not untrue, I will say.
I don't like this one.
How many cinema Roberto memes, Jenny memes, Jeb memes.
I can't believe that's an actual picture of Jeb.
I know.
I wish I knew the context of why he was doing that.
Someone in chat will have it.
Yeah, if someone in chat knows, let me know.
This is an eMan gameplay one.
Dawn of War.
Yeah, boy.
That DOM looks like it was always there.
Good shit.
eFAT 40K.
This would be the Smiler Al version of the 8-bit stuff.
Oh, there's ER.
Hmm?
I think that's ER.
No, Smiler Al.
ER is the different color scheme, and I don't think there is an ER one yet.
And look at this craziness.
Apparently, Borderlands is kind of a fan of eFAT, but I don't know.
It's just a fresh rat.
Fresh rat.
They're clearly inching toward it, I can tell.
That seems like a trap.
Yeah, kind of.
That's neat.
I don't know.
I'm assuming this is something else's image of death, like the clock of death.
But if you want to apply me to death, I'm not going to say that's a big wrong, right?
But it does suggest things that are interesting.
Oh, look at Jamie.
Nothing.
Got him.
Save.
Save.
I guess that's from him.
Oh, from his green.
Yeah.
His shitty Kylo Ren mug.
Celestial Epicry.
Epicary.
What have we got going on here?
Everyone's blue.
What is this?
Oh, so this is Bloodborne.
Bloodborne, yeah.
Thanos against.
Yeah, that's.
Oh, it was.
Oh, yeah.
Because he had a sword.
Like it looked like.
Oh, wait a minute.
That's not even a fucking Bloodborne character.
No, no, no, it's not.
But it's the Bloodborne boss.
The fungi man.
That meme is really good.
That took a lot of work.
This is the thing that exists.
Oh, no.
It's beautiful.
What we should definitely do is we should put it in a public
place and make it a crime to destroy it instead of throwing it
right into the landfill.
Yes, that thing is gorgeous.
I love it.
Make it a crime to destroy it.
It is important that this is displayed on the stream.
No.
So explain what happened here.
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
Just replace the fucking color with little rhinos.
Yep.
It's the most to explain.
I look like him.
I have to accept this fact.
Like, I'm not.
I don't like it, but it's true.
So you admit you're related.
Yes.
My God.
I could be.
Did he have kids?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You turned Celtic against me.
You have done that yourself.
I don't think he's actually against him or anything, but I don't
know.
This is when I was referencing how people go so nuts.
With how it's a reference to a thing.
So it's okay.
But I said, what if two sumos just battled on top of a star
destroyer?
Like, there's a reference to see wrestling wrestling.
That's that's another one.
They could be a surreal me.
I think there's three.
So much concern.
It's one eyes are so yellow.
Apparently she hasn't closed them in a long time.
That makes sense.
Totally.
She slept twice.
We got someone watching the fab with pizza.
Can't say that's a bad choice.
Good stuff.
Is that a is that a pineapple on that pizza?
It looks like it is.
I'm afraid.
Oh, no.
What a shit meme.
I look like this meme is like POV from the pizzas perspective.
You can see almost all the pizza.
Well, yeah.
If you look down, you can see almost all of yourself.
Oh, the pizza taking a selfie.
Okay, I can get that.
Yeah.
Pizza taking a salt sort of, I guess.
Well, if we imagine that there's eyes at the top of the pizza
and it's looking down, that's like mainly what it would say.
How do we wait?
How do we know we're not at this?
Isn't from the bottom of the pizza looking up because the eyes
aren't at the bottom fucking dipshit.
How do you tell me where the eyes are on a pizza?
Tell me where the fucking eyes are on the top of the pizza.
On the top of the circle.
The pizza.
That's a circle.
Yes.
It's the top because that's where the eyes are.
You've upset him.
No, Jay.
No, no, no, no.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Just let's find.
Hang on.
This is a necklace drawing from metal.
He has entered the memes.
Is that metal?
Yes.
I can see that.
It's a shame he doesn't have any eyes in his nose.
They're fucking massive.
I don't really know the context of this image, but it really shows
where pizza's eyes are.
Oh, right.
What the fuck?
I mean, he's not wrong.
It does kind of show.
You get it up for chat.
I don't know if they're aware of this.
This is we're getting into the thing is contextually.
Nothing's wrong.
If the pizza has been cooked in the oven, it's probably dead.
So the eyes would be eyes could be closed and they just would
look like it's what brings life.
I was going to say that's not how it works.
But by your logic, Jay, the pizza has like fucking 12 eyes
or some shit, depending on how much it's been cut.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
No.
Oh, well.
So someone wanted to tell us about small good rat.
It's a Halloween rat loaf.
Halloween rat loaf.
Oh, my goodness.
Imagine being presented with this and how you'd be like,
whoa, that's you put some effort into that.
Some real effort into making that look as appealing as possible.
Cleaned off that mouse trap, right?
Why?
That's what he.
I think one of the flavor is a real rat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Southpaw's rendition of critical drinker.
Lego form.
You would do this for a known racist alt writer.
Reviewing movies.
Disgusting.
Man's more of a Nazi than Jay Hemler.
Mm hmm.
Somebody in chat wrote Jim La earlier.
Jim.
I like that one.
Taking one last look at my masses.
That meme is more sad than the actual scene in the trailer.
Just realized that neon cover was not fucking accurate.
Disgusting.
I'm a terrible host.
I apologize.
So there's a couple of year of the 3D drawn ones, right?
So we're going to have to get a bit of you might have to click these
ones because some of them have video in them.
Right.
Oh, there's pictures you got.
This is a wags.
I think burning a straw man.
There's the opinion holes.
Someone's throwing things off a roof.
Money and people.
Money and people.
That doesn't look much like people to me.
Oh, yeah.
There's people.
They're white.
So it's hard to spot them, but there are people.
It's like, oh, yeah, they are little people.
Then you got the opinion hold.
I guess people get thrown into.
Yeah.
There's a little efap, like what do you call them?
Sort of.
It's because we're all super chats about throwing people off roofs.
You know, is this drawn in a tilt brush?
No idea.
But there looks like it's brought in tilt brush.
It's really good.
I love these 3D ones.
I'm a farmer for this meme.
Or am I?
Is that an axe I have?
There are more of these.
But right now we've got this one.
I guess this is us in G-Mod.
It's just Slender Man.
Crystal Ball.
Future Ball at Baller.
Yes, it was a Future Ball.
Not the Great Debate 2.
It's obviously the movie poster when it gets released.
Like instead of Nike.
They're back for everyone who believes in objectivity.
Electric Boogaloo.
So, Rags, want to do some reading?
I would love to do some reading.
All right.
So this is The Cosmic Chicken Part 1, written by Bagidious.
He says,
The Cosmic Chicken came to me one evening when I found the orphans that stole my rhino milk right out of my hands.
I was on them when suddenly something stopped me.
Something massive.
Yet I couldn't see what had stopped me.
I was terrified.
But I suddenly heard the chicken.
Then, out of nowhere, a huge flash of light blinded me.
I was transported to somewhere far into the universe.
And that's where I saw him.
The Cosmic Chicken himself.
I was confused and scared.
But then the chicken looked at me and I was suddenly not scared.
I was calm.
He then said,
I am known as The Cosmic Chicken.
I was stunned that he knew my name.
I was fascinated that the legends were true of a Cosmic Chicken.
He continued,
You are truly a massive and a great scholar, my boy.
I looked at him confused and I asked,
What is a massive?
He laughed and said,
My friend, you have much to learn.
So yeah, that's official lore.
This is only part one.
This is only part one.
Where could go from here?
It's intense stuff.
Yeah.
So I appreciate the meme, but I mean,
I'm totally on board with complaining about matriculations.
I say it in my episode three review.
But what about the matriculations?
I would never throw them out the window for that.
Rawwood.
Yeah.
Maybe this is raw wearing my mask.
Who knows?
I don't know what this is from,
but it says Happy Wags on it,
which is good enough for me.
Happy Wags.
Oh, is this like a diary of a kid stuff?
Possibly.
I don't know.
I haven't seen that.
I think that is.
Happy Wags.
I've been boarding.
I haven't been boarding in a while.
So sorry about that.
This is like me,
but as I'm willing to let people guess what this is a mashup of,
because I'm not entirely sure.
I'm assuming an animu.
Sounds like that.
Looks like Code Vein.
Oh, it could be him.
With the whole neck thing that goes over.
It could be like the gas mask thingy.
Fair enough.
I assume this was created in relation to eFap,
but I don't actually know.
It could not be.
Also, opinion holds a good old logo for it.
The official eFap rig.
Yeah.
It's another gaming for reference.
This is apparently for.
Remarkable Republicans video.
Bisexualism.
Oh, my God.
Arthur Fleck is a bisexual and this plays a major role in his breakdown.
Arthur's relationship with his mother has some edible qualities.
That means, I guess, in chat,
Oedipus is the guy who kills his dad and marries and fucks his mom.
It's considered Oedipus complex, right?
Yes.
It's actually Freud, I think, who is Freudian.
Freudian.
Freudian, of course.
Of course.
The idea is that we look for,
when a man looks for a woman,
he wants qualities that he sees in his mother.
That sort of thing.
Let's see.
He his imagined romance with his neighbor is an homage to how Brad Pitt
imagined Edward Norton by his side and the minimal intimacy between the couple
shows Arthur's conflicted emotions.
Doesn't go that backwards if he's talking about Fight Club.
Also, I don't know what that has to do with him being bisexual.
No, because it's a girl.
Nothing to do with being bisexual.
Next bullet.
Arthur clearly has an attraction to Thomas Wayne and Marie Franklin.
He expresses his attraction in very strange ways.
And last bullet point, this conflict of his sexuality and rejection
by all four of his romantic interests turned Arthur into the Joker.
Don't know what that has to do.
We should visit one of these videos again.
No, just come on.
That's for insanity.
Oh, yes, we can.
The last one is pretty good.
I like this one, considering what we just read.
Oh, I remember that.
Yeah, yeah.
The Joker is a film about how Arthur struggles with mental illness.
He's shaped by the circumstances of society he lives in.
That leads Arthur to become the Joker.
No, no, let's have our own narrative.
We've got another scammy idea, you.
Oh, God.
Jesus.
If these memes haven't made you want to go see Efap Gaming 4, chat, you got to do it.
Just do it.
Oh, my God.
Subversive chieftain.
Oh, no, not Yerksky, the subversive chieftain.
He's dangerous.
Not Yerksky.
Um, this is from Meme Repository.
Oh, I saw this one.
It's beautiful.
I'd like to point out, I like this chat, this this chat comment.
I used to think Remarkable Republican was a tragedy.
Now I see it as a comedy.
Yeah, this is Jay.
He got his Video Total Party.
He did not resort to character assassination and insults to defend himself and
emitted some mistakes while still feeling free to disagree and ask questions.
Joe Jay chose to make friends, improve his content and show humility.
You can say Jay.
Angry Jew instead of being the big gay.
Feel like Jay.
Gio.
Aw.
What a nice story.
You need a Gio in your image there.
Jay is an S plus tier meme.
It's true.
I like this.
Even though I didn't say it was a Gio.
I like this.
Even though it's not like I think that the other seasons are amazing or something, but
seven seasons were gifted to the race of men who above all else desire quality.
But another season was made.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Also, again, I guess you were right about Fortnite.
I'm in Fortnite as well.
There you are.
There you go.
You have three fingers.
I'll get over it.
More than enough?
Yeah, you can grab some.
Oh, no, you're like, you're like Dale.
Like Dale.
So we got a lot here.
Efap Mitty reacting to Batwoman.
We got, I guess I've got the Welsh flag on me.
Batwoman's got the Isle of Man.
And I got the Bat Cleaver.
Bat Cleaver.
And she's saying, I'm a woman.
She's got the kicky legs on her chest.
The giddiest in the bottom left there.
Yeah.
And I'm not there.
Hooray.
Yeah.
You can't really see the bat cleavers.
Probably fell off the roof.
Raw three often.
I said this, it's nicely cut.
I'm entirely sure of what's happening here.
I'm Dr. Doom giving children ice cream.
I don't know why, but it's important.
Who's that guy in the back?
Oh, ice cream man, I guess.
Oh, it's just part of it.
Yeah.
I guess that's just part of the picture.
I was wondering.
Oh, God.
I am inevitable.
Episode died.
I have bullet.
All right.
We will be covering it.
It's going to happen.
We're currently living in a pre episode nine world.
You realize that won't exist for very long.
We're almost out of that.
Live it up.
Yeah.
I'm going to be in Washington state on the 20th.
I should see if I could at least still see the movie while jet
legged.
This is harassment.
Sexual harassment.
It's very funny.
Release raw.
Here comes the roof.
Like a fucking thing.
He throws it before this point.
Again, an episode for me as gaming episode for me.
It's not.
Oh, rags.
You have a left.
Tresnik dictionary.
Tresnik approved.
Most trusted.
Years ahead of its time.
Better than my mother and bad Freudian.
Happy.
Adjective.
Sad.
Then.
I'm glad we got this.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure?
Are you sure about that?
All right.
That actually might be it for images.
No, sorry.
Well, I mean, no, no.
About 50 more came in in the last hour.
One more portion.
No promises on how long they're going to be.
But yes, this is me.
Miss worth one quarter portion.
This has been added to my discord as a emote.
And I love it when it's used.
Is this.
Yes.
That's the one.
That's the mode.
It's very important and relevant.
Are you sure about that?
Someone created me in what I assume is like blender or one of the
other 3D modeling things.
Terrifying.
Say the least.
Damn.
Wonderful.
It's like an alien.
It looks like something you'll find an uncharted like a little
artifact.
Yeah.
It looks like that woman pre hair.
Where's the key to unlock your nose?
I want to make everyone aware because some people might not see
it.
But this was Amy trying to draw a guy dancing in.
A guy dancing.
What in 1940s Germany.
That's fantastic.
Here I want to read this out.
It's only small.
I think you'll like it.
Let's see.
Yo.
What are themes?
They're nothing but memes.
That's what Mahler deems.
So drop these schemes and listen to my streams.
And I even have a little dab.
Dab on.
Dab on.
So you know how the batarangs are calibrated for Bruce's long
arms.
At this point I'm ready to believe that Luke's fetish is getting
assaulted by women.
I'm a woman.
Such great.
This is a movie that's coming out soon.
I can't wait to see it.
Massive Productions and Efap in association with a disco far
away presents a film by a fellow massive long man.
Mola rags Wolf.
That's actually that's actually creepy.
Yes.
Genuinely really creepy.
That's actually genuinely pretty creepy.
That's it.
I want to see this movie.
Oh man.
No I'm too spooky.
It's coming out on DVD video too neat.
Oh no I don't want that in my house.
It's too spoopy.
Oh no.
Massive Productions and Efap in association with a disco far
away presents a film by a fellow massive long man.
Yes.
No yes.
I have the tiredness.
You do.
And yes this is a rendition of the spiders seeing into the
future.
Is that a little fun.
This one's one from a guy who draws scary drawings.
Do we wait.
Do we cover this one.
I'm starting to think that this seems familiar or do we not.
This is no replies.
I don't know if I can do this Alex.
Just think of something dope to say.
OK.
Hey.
Is a baby wavy.
You ever get a guy.
Hey wavy.
Oh yeah.
I'm pretty sure we've looked at this.
The guy that blocked someone on Twitter for a meme.
Get away from me you weirdo.
You're a quack.
Because he blocked some.
Yeah he blocked rags because he shared a meme.
So me and Mel were playing.
No no no no no.
Someone shared a meme about me.
Shit.
Shared one of my memes.
It wasn't even me.
Yeah I know.
So we made a joke about how crap a lot of like telltale
slash until dawn the super massive games things.
Yeah.
Like you take a drink of water.
It'll be like the ocean will.
You killed me.
You consumed me.
I think this is when rags been given Daenerys
his story and he was like.
Imagining being with Khal Drogo maybe.
I'm not sure.
He's a handsome one.
He is handsome.
Just what went through my mind.
You know my mind well.
Imagine being young woman.
Was this is the left grown damn.
I actually drew that.
You're still a guest.
They did.
He's drew me sleeping.
Ground day pickle ground a pickle.
Yeah that's good shit.
You're still objectively a guest.
I think I think rags is happy about that.
Yeah I think so.
I'm fine with being a guest.
The moral arithmetic of big idiots morality is measured
in the base unit of murdered civilian MC.
A bad act is positive MC negative units.
A good act is negative MC units.
As long as the person's total MC score comes out of zero
or lower the world is better off for them.
So killing into self defense.
So it's like for a singular unit of murdered civilian.
So freeing a slave is equal to one murder civilian
like makes sense petting a dog.
Equal to zero point zero one murder civilians.
You got to pet a hundred people to kill someone
but you've had a hundred dogs.
Then there you go.
Got crafting memetics.
That's 18 murder civilians.
Being an orphan for murder civilians naturally.
Burning down a major city depends on who's judging obviously.
Touching a woman's map eight murdered civilians.
Oh no not a map.
The thing that big idiots was way ahead of his time.
What can I say?
He was a smart man.
The man had some ideas.
The man I man big idiots.
He had some big ideas you know.
He did.
He did.
This is a wonderful rendition of the dawn and Joker hanging out.
Putting on a happy face.
Wonderful little rainbow in the background as well.
This is more from Mr. 3D man.
I guess this is me and Rags battling with several Jedi of some kind.
Terrifying like I said but accurate.
Yeah.
I like how Rags has like Wolverine clothes and then I've got like.
Because I'm fucking amazing.
I guess.
This is a.
All the Jedi are fighting us.
So the idea with this is like to take fonts from like metal bands.
The hate mongers of the toxic brood are objectively good in my opinion.
It's awesome.
That's good.
You can get them framed.
The toxic brood can be a metal band.
Oh yeah.
Like the spiders too.
This is obviously commentary on the fact that.
Dentists know their shit.
And when it comes to Game of Thrones I imagine.
Again if I'm giving for.
I really like this with a father for tear.
Across to the alien.
I like the concerned battle ball phase.
I got hacked.
Rags is Rags alien is outside Rags.
Were you ever the alien?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's like rags were you ever the alien.
I was never the alien.
Yeah.
Never the alien.
Not a single time.
Like you still got your shades on though.
Or course they never leave you.
I'm I'm.
I've got hacked.
No I don't know how this was constructed but it's adorable.
I've got I guess a rags pillow.
On my.
Oh my god.
Seat made a pile of man flags maybe.
yeah I think it was the alien three times when we were playing this yeah we
got Church of the Dawn I believe this is Father Fortia practicing the Church of
the Dawn very good as he should as he should yeah he knows this stuff very
holy this one is uh this is one of the early ones for your street battle I
think from yeah the same guy oh yeah it was actually what was the reference yeah
it was referencing Thomas Folds wasn't it because the light yes molar
production I saw that now Ronald sludge village oh yeah so this this one's a
whole album as well you got guestless hold on good bad good bad and rats some
lizard what the fuck rag is this is that you got the Isle of Bad Flag is just
chilling out there's Aiden several rats oh there's some grimace oh whatever was
grimace if you've got the a dolphin in the whale fighting in space I remember
talking about that but this is so much the spider has Thor's hammer these we've
got a section for super chats it's like me just presenting it I think it's
taking a while to do yeah I'm curious how it works like how well like once you
put the helmet on everything has depth and it's way easier than you think
there's more seen by others well I mean it's not as easy to like you know be
hardest trying in 3d space yeah absolutely I like it's just right in your
forehead oh wait it's true wait click it there's a lot more I did it click it
okay
drinking through the Bay Bay's yeah
they're all like very if episode specific like they'll apply to yeah yeah
that alien game that that brought out a lot of memes I don't think I would have
been able to call that yeah played that four times I love this um so the
contacts me email streams man of madon or men of fucking don't care the the way
it worked was the way you make like you can just play on your own or you can
have you know multiple people on the same PC hot seat it sort of thing and
we chose that option then it was like okay so name your individual people now
every time you typed anything once the letter goes in it pulls you back out of
like in the same way that you know you have to like click like discord to type
a message and then click out of it Karen with whatever you're doing you have to
click back in so every time you type a letter you have to do it again if you
type e it would like if you weren't already in into the thing it would like
delete the profile and send you back to the beginning yeah and it would like
whenever you first click it highlights everything you've done so if you type
anything after that you delete all of it the most fucking infuriating system
I've ever had to type a name with and I just love this be where we probably took
like 10 minutes just put in the names like the happy ghosts in the background
as well yeah the dark souls of values yes we had alcohol to help us get
through yeah madam madam was fucking terrible by the way I would I would
recommend until doing 10 times over before that game I don't know what the
hell they were doing like I don't know just watch the stream it's only like four
hours it's not yeah I haven't seen the stream yet I think we had fun obviously
but the game itself like oof I like how simple this one is hi I love J I love
kick J oh beautiful and then as a follow-up oh that is scary imagine that
running at you and then like if that was a cult that would be the tattoo that all
of them I like the dark souls of menus thing that's yeah this is me battling the
Isle of Man flag I suppose oh my goodness that flag yeah this is all from
the same guy any of these 3d ones yeah I think it's all from the same guy yeah
yeah this guy's a tilt brush enthusiast I kind of love it oh this is fucking
hilarious fly you fuck yeah raw is slowly becoming literally the Sun God
depiction as well well that's what I'm saying is that it's getting it's coming
along I want that so those like my initial intention I was just thinking
about smite when it when I said because this I think it's smite in the mummy
that's how I know about raw
this was made because for some reason you can't have a community without them
wanting to ship stuff that I make hour-long videos so that I'm extremely
concise and precise about what I'm talking about so I find that infuriating
how we should hang out more I get the same criticism what I'm trying to
actually be precise I can push that up a little bit yeah I like that it's all
in her aesthetic yes that team is cool
this is like a cool I don't know what the the team is but like a what was it
Jay you said you studied it
photo manipulation I studied it I said I did it you said you got a study in it I
know I dropped out in first year I never have said I got a degree we currently
have a career in it you said you invented it you said you were born in it
mm-hmm molded by it you've got Darth Vader's respirator there I do with a
skull red eyes got the monster wheelies even if apps up there so some cool shit
looks awesome yeah next up there's a couple of Pikachu ones that I gotta make
sure we actually saw as in the artist Pikachu I think this one was like I
don't know if they don't know how I found it but I liked it
stick the tesla me eyes yeah another interesting drawing we got I guess it's
Dale and he's got like a shad symbol on his it was massive cancer but now he's
got a chat what is raw here like an alien he's squid
Billy's yeah you just got belch for a rag okay it was massive cancer I like
the squid Billy's thing drawings are cool are they not oh look at that it's
all rags wolf I like that that's really cool I wonder if I hate everything's
friend is aware of how much we've said wags thanks to oh I don't know if you've
seen this Jay but I'm assuming before I can't remember anymore I've not seen
this well then this is geode the arts actually really good yeah I guess it's
like reference to a Steven Universe but maybe it is you know so much you saw
animators even universe you can make this character Jay yeah this is me I'm
doing my stream with Luigi's Mansion and someone create some art oh 25 year old
long man happy birth moon moolah oh strata Meyer I didn't notice it first
probably cuz it's made in paint or something yeah it's not quite like
it's a lot 25 year old long man I like the Luigi moolah cross over I like how
the nose thing is the key the keyholes I like that so he's squeezing the shit
out of I don't understand what why is any of this I don't know what's the
context what happened pizza is it bad the part of this that baffles me the
most isn't it so it's a road it's a road it's a concrete shit pizza there is
context for this and we may never know what it is I like this good shit you
work if I've gave me four lots of beams yeah speaking of which one of the like
top fucking beams that shirt was great there's no way when you drew that you'd
have thought yeah this is gonna become one of the is gonna become this is me
mid-dry here those four years drawing apparently yeah but you know there were
that yeah well this is I love you bods humans humans I just got back what the
fuck rags I think you've seen this before but it's still awesome I have
yeah this is a great one gun on the top of this gun like weapon right there a
gun like staff is a gun like weapon oh this is really good I really really like
this I didn't see the tism wizard tism wizard oh I'd love to make the tism
wizard you should be in some kind of gable show important character that helps
people progress again back to the scanning is that neck offs drawing for
those who haven't seen it probably like why does what is the beam I keep saying
I was you got to keep up with the lore yeah yeah what the fuck you miss one
stream and you're gonna be out of the loop man I ain't buying it you know the
rhino dollars in Don we trusted says the neat rendition
there's so much I love about this so cool
oh that's great I love that that's really cute everyone's just great all
Aiden sleeping this is I guess me as the Joker running from movie pop escape the
better narrative angry he looks you come right here oh look at the bells it's
just probably says meta on us you can just barely see the e and a ta oh yeah
good shit I think I think we can all appreciate this meme
yeah what if he was one of the people that I'm sure he'd still agree it was better off
she freed slaves yeah we live in a meta narrative I think it's this picture
is referencing taxon here like in also yeah yeah yeah I think so cuz he uses
that I guess he uses that little doggy picture on like Twitter or something oh
yeah but he's like a psychotic vindictive evil stupid dog I think it
suits him so well he's a yappy little dog that isn't useful in any way just
makes noise and is annoying yeah that's him follow-up image
I think running mascara yes adorable droids it's funny how like we're
actually starting to spread out into several known artists among the Pikachu
yeah good Pikachu I love that cost bail and obviously and I guess the 3d
artists there's all these different like reoccurring ones the guy who makes the
terrifying ones like this I like the the eyes like the eye shadow yeah
underneath it the creepy thing I really like that that crazy ex-girlfriend sort
of that's that's Eric Texan yeah
the wonderful wolf as well I can't remember when this was made all the
references but he's got the pizza I'm not sure it's got his pizza though and I
already already say these Pikachu ones they're very good oh yeah
so I get lots to lots of images to save kind of back up a whole oh wait have you
seen this one you're right I got over showed this I think I
hello hello I'm why oh yeah I guess this is sort of me looking reacting to the
wolf what I think call to duty yeah just awesome awesome versions cuteness
overload oh I'm dying of cuteness yeah super cute
droids they are very cute they're bubbly and and then my soft lines very rounded
to completely swap genres of drawing check this out this is a I think high
quality well like a high-resolution once might take some time I want to click
it yeah this one's really good
ah yes
I'm checking out chats reaction oh god nice
so rhino milk 100% on his wrist the oh hey that's nifty yeah that that's really
nifty the the savers light it lighting as well
sorry just looking at it for a bit is that such a problem you know just
appreciative space yeah it's good shit mola has a stick like weapon
this is another one I think this way slipped through the cracks like I was
giving it a while ago and I never put it on screen I don't think so anyway but
observe mortals as I say the M weird
it's Halloween suitable and it's got efap or the belt I think as well the
pumpkin is really cool yeah oh and yes this one cold people were very happy
once this was created yeah
man that I love man flag cuz it doesn't have to keep rolling to stay steady you
can do it on one foot right yeah he's got a lot of balance to him but who's to
say this isn't a still frame of him charging towards me I think he's
charging in this oh everyone's gonna reference and none of us know that cuz
we're not weeps I'm so disappointed I don't know I like I know I know enough to
know it's a Jojo thing but I don't know anything about the memes themselves no
oh I guess we've got to watch that show yes we're out on the memes so Rags have
you seen this one me and Mel have yeah I have this one is so great this one's
really good intense good rat you're Aiden riding Goliath with me and Rags
with the dawn is carrying an orphan while also carrying metal up the
mountain as we reach the good rat yeah metal looks very medley I think that
makes sense you know like yeah that looks like it really fits his avatar
well as you can see the eyes are really sad lips but if there was if there was a
I could make like an efap gallery these will be one of the ones that would like
just be like a framed portrait there's been a shit ton of them though
and yeah actually that symbolizes signifies the end of the images really
yeah we made it that only took like how long was that too long so we have
three hours in now well we we started with the meme rankings no no but how
many images a hundred hundreds longer some reason I looked looked at it right
when we stopped with the tears and it was 100 minutes and then we start with
the images oh well I was gonna say I can get it down to literally the minute
cuz I just have to look at the first one I posted you guys right
but yeah those are all collected and I imagine that I'll probably be doing more
collecting now as we go forward efaps but um they pile up they pile up they
do pile up that was an hour and 50 minutes neat of just images oh you know
like a million two or three all of them we get like it with copyright probably
but that's okay ready here oh yeah cool stuff to give you guys the invite
Oh people have people been tweeting stuff to me oh no did you see the effect
movie one which is apparently already if after movie part one 17 minutes did
we watch oh that's like the halo Mass Effect mash-up one right I think so yes
oh we've got a look at a movie both made a dark fate review I'll have to watch
that I watched critical I watched his review of dark fate it's not very good
he says a lot of wrong thing things I had a lot of people in my comment
section say yeah but you're wrong cuz critical said it was good and like okay
oh god no he doesn't even really make arguments though what's what's his best
argument I think it's a lot of vague stuff like unfortunately so I'm thinking
about the kind of thing that you get is I don't know that the film has great
action the plot has some stupid in it but not like loads of stupid something
in my penis the plot is all stupid if we have a specific efap for like covering
anything to do with dark fate I'll probably throw it in it's not a flashy
video because like a lot of the stuff he says is the kind of thing where we
can't do anything about it like I said with them ones that are like we said we
said about some stuff Jenny was saying or we've come across it before I'm
trying to think of like a specific person where they say stuff we can't
necessarily if you just go I was boring it was it was this it was this it was
this we're second okay okay okay but uh some stuff he says are easy for
conversation starters I just I think he'll reconsider his perspective on the
film maybe eventually also I'm collecting extra memes yeah that's why I
was a little bit oh no even more well we're gonna continue on with with video
memes but that doesn't mean we won't check some of these picture ones out at
the end I'm still collecting them because I got the HD versions of those
other ones they got they got they got blurred in transit you see that's the
internet for you blurring things I think this has proven that really are a long
podcasts what it was look at pictures 84 hours it's funny that I'm talking
about this while getting a meme prepared about how there's too many memes I'm in
danger of falling asleep at this point well I mean I know you made it unless the
pictures so I imagine the videos will probably wake you up a bit like you know
how you woke up very late yes I know it's like I'm energy and I could go
probably go for a while you're the reverse of that aren't you I'm exactly
the reverse of that yeah I've been waking up so late that I've been waking
up early all right so our first one is if app meme Captain Marvel meets Goliath
and I think I want to say this might be legends just know straight me the fuck
out what I didn't realize there's noise for coming
for a thousand years bound beneath these waves I have watched you I have this
Goliath yeah she meets Goliath you gotta be glad your ass oh it's will the
whole craft is not you that's the John it won't be long now your death is no
king only I can sustain you
what is happening I haven't seen this he's her reflection in his eyes I guess
maybe oh oh that's gotta be Goliath at that point
Oh yeah
something about a horrible tentacle monster assaulting Egypt or something
similar I want to see that movie it's not Egypt it's a lady say this was
Warcraft it's a lady who name could be Egypt you have some weird names out there
could be Egypt and yes apparently this is world of Warcraft oh pretty cool
cutscene
not a slave give us the fuck that Santa come on I don't know the Goliath to a
date pre-loss and I don't know I'm just saying I don't know I don't know
apparently it's a mortal elf bargaining with an old god for more power
I want to find out what that cutscene actually is apparently it's world of
Warcraft can't find it we're just setting a world of walker I look at a
new world of Warcraft cutscenes you'll probably find something and also we
apparently mortal elf old god you'll find something yeah D&D amasses after
all game of thrones show with 300 characters in costume having sex that's
all you really need to know you're the show that makes me feel dumb you know
we're also the show that makes us feel dumb we screened the initial pilot for
three of our friends all writers all smart got to the end and there was just
dead silence in the room and one of our friends shakes his head and says you
guys have a massive problem you certainly didn't want to say massive when
you were embarking on this was such a massive undertaking throw that weird
around like that probably watch this maybe between that and in your friends
I can't believe it like well yeah we say it but in context so is okay but they
just just throwing it out okay agile disgusting really so here's seen the
boys me me me me there's a really quick meme it'll be funnier if you've seen the
boys copyright infringement is costing bought 1.2
these are like a couple of small video memes but still popping it in
so this we got copyrighted for using the song in the stream live but that's
fine because this one will get copyrighted regardless it didn't stop us
from streaming so it should be fine I can show this now I was talking about it
before but I'll just show it straight up this time so this is called a very
special efap Halloween story darkness faps back in the X hundreds old-time ease
there was a town and then there was an old woman who lived alone because she
was wounded but I'm just setting up the idea I don't watch this movie with you
rags see what you think of it darkness falls so the idea like I said back in
the day really old timey times something hundred back in the 80s older than
eight eighty hundreds the time ease there's a town there's a town all right
I'm spooky there's a town actually wait let me spooky music for the chat all
right reference reference it's a great no I know the reference it's fucking
nibbled off penis couldn't tell I don't know cuz you've been drinking I want to
make sure that you understand the reference I put on spooky music I put on
spook spook in you there so there's a town in the 80 18 whatever I can't hear
the music yes put it on the on the link to you guys so you can you know that's
true I should put in the watch together you're right okay I'm gonna put in the
shit with the watch everybody look for the watch together link it's really
high up in the chat scrolling I have to scroll past the gigantic comment that
left on that weird article scrolling if anyone has a link if you could repost it
I'll be fucking good good I'm using it smaller what if this what if the spooky
music's copyright well it's talking over it means that it won't get
copyrighted as long as as long as there's never a time where someone isn't
talking we will be fine as long as someone's talking okay to go and do a
thing you guys are going to take over for me okay so I'm going to go like all
right here's a spooky music okay so in this town in the 18 thingies old old
tisms there's a town who love their townness they're like oh we're such a
good town town is great and then there's this woman who got injured by a thing I
can't remember what it was but she wears a porcelain mask over half of no all of
her face because her face is all fucked up from being injured but because she's
so sad about being like oh no no one likes me anymore she says hey because
this is old-timey town and no one's ever heard of her tooth fairy she's like hey
hey kids if ever you leave a child tooth you know because losing an adult tooth
is embarrassing so if you lose a child to you come to me and I give you a little
coin little coin and it's a cool little thing she gets to interact with kids and
and and she gives them some money and she you know it's all great so picture
town forest house and that's where she is and so one day these two little kids
they houses like out of town yeah yeah she's ugly yes exactly so she's she's
sitting over there and she's like yes all of the all of the things you just said
yes so she's she's sitting in her house like Lala and then one day is this the
plot of the film you want me to see no this is the history the law if you will
of the film it doesn't spoil whatever this is this informs the rest of the
film which I will you know I'm gonna do for movies just to see what you guys
think no let's do it now we'll do it after the stream 100% okay I'm not gonna
fall asleep whatsoever so now I'm wide awake so you wake me up so one day she's
old people she's chillin she's knitting whatever you do and she has a knock at
the door she's like oh my goodness and she opens the door and there's these
these angry parents and sometimes people like hey motherfucker what'd you
do without kids she's like wait what it turns out two kids a Hansel and Gretel
if you will went to see her with the intention of trading that their
children teeth that fell out during the night for coins they've disappeared
they've disappeared she killed them obviously what else could have happened
they've disappeared and so they they put her on a stake they're like this is the
100% she's killed them 100% there's nothing else that could have happened
but on a mistake they rip off her porcelain mask by the way his skin very
sensitive to the sunlight and she's in pain she's like oh my goodness I wear
this because it protects my fragile skin from the Sun and as they set her alight
they put it to flame they're like hey motherfucker you deserve this and she's
like you know what town you know gay town every one of them in fact every
time a child loses their last tooth in this town I will come to collect it and
if they look at me if they look upon my disfigured face I will fucking kill them
you understand all right good that's very specific in the moment while you're
being confused yes but it's spooky nonetheless and so she dies and she's
burned and she's dead and she's all kinds of yes it's horrible she's ashes
all of the ashes and the townspeople they're horrified they learn that the
children got lost in the forest they're not dead they're just like oh hey we're
here hi I'm sorry we took a long we're wrong turn the path was there and you
know fuck it we guys didn't do anything stupid we were gone right no one oh my
goodness fuck it we we saw a bread trail it led us to a candy house and we ate
the candy house and you guys know we just didn't go the right way and so the
townspeople like oh my goodness we we killed a woman for no reason damn and
then fast-forward to the opening set of scenes of the movie and there's a child
a young boy who's lost his last child's tooth and he puts it under his pillow
because that's what we all do when we're younger and we're like hey mom dad give
me some money so I can buy some some stuff and for the money and creepy
things happen and then and that's I've led you into literally the opening five
minutes of the movie so that's yeah that's it that's it Halloween is
literally the coolest time of year Halloween's so cool that was really good
yeah I really like that that was really great we still have to see that movie
though we do I watched it with Mel while he was over Mel what do you think of it
oh wow it's really good some some weird tisms but the rules but it's fine
the quick one I guess everywhere I go
I see his face oh that's great I was hacked oh man some and hilarious oh
that's funny Chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about
pork he eats them he grills them he grills them twice
Wolf's Pizza good rat cosmic chicken I'm hungry that's really good I like
that good shit this is called efap in a nutshell
it's king of the monsters means I'm gonna have to do some pausing otherwise we
could actually go down stream wise
Oh hey the the flash of lightning actually flashed onto their faces you
see that
I'm looking forward to when our efap releases for this as well to give it
some time it's 17 we have on the waiting
so who's gonna be Godzilla at this I wonder I don't think it'll be Goliath no
it'll be the dawn she screamed at that creature by the way she did a very good
job seems well there's more tonal to gases in chat the entirety I guess
thematically that makes more sense it does and it is important to nail those
themes people
also yeah like I realized that by the way the with the amount of work I've been
doing stupid efap movies edits it's as low as seven seconds I've never seen it
go lower than that but that's video clip limit it seems to be I used to say 10
seven
but yeah we have to pause the shit out of this
I see jazz not great I mean what's wrong with it the legs I don't know it just
looks not good I'm ahead of you I don't know about the legs I'm ahead I'm a
little yeah
oh man imagine tackling movie ball Patrick Williams and Quinton if they did
like a collab video
yeah just gonna make sure I'm pausing this is just all I need to do is make
sure the stream doesn't go down that's the main goal here
who owns Godzilla as long as it's not zephyr we should be okay no one owns
him he's king of monsters that's true yeah
you know him running at that speed man with how big he is that is good you can't
you can't bring up how big goes the other way you fuck up him or fuck oh well
the whole city is just gonna get fucked with someone yeah yeah then he finishes
off with the radiation meltdown yeah I was gonna say he like nukes Boston at
the end of the film but they treated it so it's just like this that's fine
now we're good we'll come back tomorrow we're rebuilt no issues the buildings are
melting because of the radiation yep if you remember J and Mel we both know
about this one so we're talking about how if Ani was an actual dad in like a
family life the t-800 then surely at one point he would like break stuff for
example a toilet you probably break yeah
but I've heard a lot of people like it so what do I know mm-hmm this is called
the Battle of the Flags
oh boy
all right let's go you want a piece of me I don't want a piece of you I want the
whole thing this is a happy Madison happy Gilmore yeah Billy Madison right
happy going happy Gilmore yeah happy Madison is the company that makes the
films I think correct
I like the the older the film you go a lot of films have the fucking watermelon
punch sounds
idiot I get movie gotta pause
so I don't know how twitch are planning on trying to introduce some kind of
watch together system that you can actually watch the stuff from Amazon
Prime without it like live with an audience oh that's cool like if that
goes ahead YouTube you better catch up quick cuz we're gonna want to do yeah
watch Batwoman with a live audience what is shitty oh no it's a trap
I think you've had enough that went well didn't it now you've had enough
something that the dragon would eat the legs it wouldn't even be a thing you
just be over it depends on how big the legs are bitch comparison to the dragon
quinted face randomly
is you fap endgame part two
see how there's so many movie ones I was like I'm sure they were gonna get hit
with some hopefully not struck out entirely oh this is the 2014 one I am
the muto in this case it's a 2014 one okay better than King of the monsters
for sure
something better than that boiling hot excrement does not actually come close to
describing this fucking stop so titty inside something
we are then cursed drunk oh yeah just FYI so this is actually a clip from this
movie do you remember rags metal that they say the King Ghidorah is making the
monsters do naughty things yeah weird King Ghidorah is not even around in this
film huh this monster is fucking up everything
what film you are drunk I think this film was intended for traditional
reviewers and they will be so I remember saying that because if I'm good with it
Patrick Willems said that a traditional reviewers know this stuff and there's
the only traditional reviewer on YouTube is movie Bob though I think he'd involve
just right into that selection now because those two are buddies out logic
as much as possible since traditional reviewers are the only people who
appreciate this is like Oh Patrick Willems and movie Bob and just write a
traditional reviewers glad we moved beyond those traditions say maybe maybe
the sub traditions we should just let let go to a lack of logic
yeah I don't know if I like this movie more than king of the monsters in terms
of the entertaining bits quote-unquote but Brian Cranston is in the majority of
the human moments or at least half of them in this film so that's way better
than anyone in oh they're all just the only good person they had is completely
wasted I wouldn't call waste well he's half but it's kind of complicated it's
like a really he's like our main character for a while so it's like good
shit they should have done the same with Charles Dan's fuck it I know he's old I
don't know what happens to Brian Cranston's character hello there I've
heard people complain about it yeah because it was a really stupid
decision
it's a shipping video I didn't realize why do we have to be giant hideous
monsters what's that about huh you're trying to tell me
if app okay so the idea is the radiation helps the monster lay like egg things
just trying to lay if app is if I was helping it lay TFA part 3 I'm confused
but all right official music video music video so this is space efap just an
ordinary resupply mission this is Kerbal which means I can play it in full thank
the goodness you see the thumbnails just got Jay's face Oh
22 tons of rhino milk sponsored by Jeff
it's cheap to rock it
I think we can all see what that that's not right a milk at all
the music is so well chosen oh boy he coming
handling that thing is not easy and quite some training had to be done to
move it like this I guess I'm the world's best low gravity tri-leg pilot
did you say ultimate question it's available in Steam Workshop just search
for the triskelion terror anyways guys good shit so this one's go lose
the clips for music I don't know what's gonna happen in terms of copyright we'll
do what we can we shall do what we can
even three I think three seconds that will get me in trouble I don't know what's
gonna happen with this this is this is all music yes this is a this video is a
minefield you think it's too dangerous or what I don't know it might be too
dangerous I think this might because this one's literally music yeah this
might be one we because the problem the problem is less because I can fight
claims even though I'll probably have like 17 on this you fab just takes one
and it says worst-case scenario I get a strike and then the stream goes down
which is possible I wouldn't it takes it can take a month to clear a strike so
like this is not something that you know is this something is can we place this
like for somebody else to watch in their own time oh well I can link it I guess
yeah it's like on YouTube or some it'll it's not currently in the description it
will be you know when it gets re-uploaded also it's called quick play
everyone's theme it's by coherent ramblings and yeah I would love it but
it's super dangerous that's all yeah the copyright is work differently for
um being live this is uploading as well because like YouTube's like oh you're
trying to make money off it like whoa whoa buddy by the way um I'm gonna hang
on I'm gonna do you mind if I step out for a little bit because I got some
work stuff that came up I gotta make a bunch of stupid calls I'll I can step
back in when I'm done is that okay sure okay well I'll just jump back in when
I'm done so you guys enjoy yourselves I'll be back in a bit all right sure
this is a great movie by the way yeah what is it my blue brothers gonna have
to pause gotta be careful even though I've already let more than a play than I
probably should it so let's quit this video in it yes I went well didn't it
it is a cool screwdriver hello man would say
it's quitting time I guess it's quitting time it's quitting time as in
not to be confused with quitting time no no no very different I was gonna say
like you know I was I was here for the promise of memes Oh kick me actually
well now I can't do memes cuz chats gonna be upset at me if I do memes it's
quitting time how long you free for Jay I'm free for a while all right then people
point that out you said you're free for a while you stayed like about the 10
hours well that is a while yes it is
the elephant musics on the other side of the door I genuinely don't know was it
just kick V and it got turned into J as awkward as this sounds oh you guys
ready for some memes this is really good this I really like this works really well
this scene is super for Jack Saint who doesn't understand that people who said
the super chats also make a meme about the super chat lest you be yeeted and
chat will bring great famine upon you my goodness the elongated male critic
right I love it what a great movie so I guess this came after the end of The
Spoon Wars I'm also back from the dead I found out I didn't I wasn't aware that I
had died but I had died and the Chronicles is the Chronicles of the epic Spooderman Wars
but I'm back I forced myself back from the grave so I can have my kangaroo Jack oh boy last time
on Spooder Wars loyalty to Disney like everybody like this
what they made number 14 the aftermath Quintan you won the coin toss tell him
about the about the racism and the sexism in Star Wars so here's the thing
fucking hate marsupials you know today's what I would be a much happier person if we
found a way to
survive harassment harassment ouch that's Dale by the way oh my goodness he's doctor
yeah oh my god they're all here metaphor for racist point of meaningless as an act of film
criticism to oh my god if I can shoot laser beams out of my hands today's episode is inspired
in part by a recently viral YouTube video but you're watching movies wrong you're watching
movies sorry fighter sounds well this is like if a like if a poop like you ever YouTube
kind of yeah I don't think I stay W is a real sexual harassment that you get to look
at women at the same time harassment harassment women harassment women harassment women harassment
bring it back this will resolve cancel culture completely God they killed right now so what
is I'm assuming this shows a specific spider-man cartoon versus I guess not when I know a person
who's actually touching on a deeper pet peeve I have no you can like stuff that's objectively
that I really like some of the possible kick his ass for me look at women sometimes they
just don't like women oh people saying f and oh no oh no chat stream take it down oh yeah
uh-oh has it been suspended yeah what's does have a reason for policy violations what stream
suspended for policy violations what's what's that mean I assume the spider-man cartoon has
got some heavy copyright it was either that or the one before this which which one would it have
been I haven't got any notifications for it yet apparently I'm oh it's back it's back yeah it can't
be back if if there's policy violations that seems very unlikely I'm gonna send it it's back for me
yeah that you saw it say policy violations yes yeah yeah yeah and then just went back online
that's just you know you just stop violating policy it's okay but what we don't know what
we did wrong my guess is that they could my guess is that it was like a live copyright id
and then as soon as you turned it off it was like oh they've stopped doing it is that how that
worked I don't think that's how that works though I've never heard well that would that would explain
to us well no give it a give you five minutes see what happens I'm gonna load up my phone so I can
see if it goes down again I'm gonna I guess use the loo do it this is yeah this was my concern
don't worry I'm doing it you violated policy you showed a bunch of beams in a video
gosh this is why I'm always considered about beams videos anyway it's not the part where we can't
get the effect back up once it's uploaded to moolah because I can wait on that it's a
tourist one kills my stream that's the worry you always want a separate platform to be able
to stream the memes on I suppose that might be the answer at one point maybe like twitch
is twitch millennium or stuff like this twitch um don't they mute your vod instead of killing you
uh well the only time my streams got muted or the vods got muted was when I was playing
third age so apparently like music and stuff was pretty hard like those got like muted all the
way through like the ost is like out taboo you violated the law apparently there's background
music in this meme that's uh from amazing spider-man 2 I suppose some people have been saying
huh I didn't even oh my god imagine striking someone because they use content from amazing
spider-man 2 I know you'd think they'd have standards about all of this but no apparently
even bad films deserve copyright what's that about new feature happened to SFO this morning
because I thought relevance to anything we're talking about oh yeah I'm not saying twitch is
fucking lenient and other things efap would have been banned off twitch probably by now
I don't know actually though but um I mean we're still up yeah speaking of still being up I'm
gonna have to not be in a minute so I'm gonna have to hop out really even though this some
videos are very relevant to you coming up it's fine the people who made them gonna be very
disappointed they're gonna put down disagreements you know what you've you've persuaded me to stay
for at least 20 hours what should I do about what should I do about this video then should I keep
playing it even though it's the whole thing or what should I do no idea do advise me I have to
go to toilet yeah um I just have to pause more maybe snack beards on me look at women look at
you guys I wish I could play it for longer than a few seconds
chad if that stream goes straight back to violating policy
it's like don't you play it like but but there are a bunch of crap
what the hell happened to quinniton quinniton
I think oh when they don't have quotes don't play it it's dangerous look at wibbit bad lad
don't risk it I mean the music's not playing anymore at least
don't know it was the music though true um but if that was the reason it was going down
uh
feels bad man if we just go through real real nice and carefully quick get the packet arm off of him
jay you have to come up with commentary on every six seconds um he's brown table funny
I'm being harassed you're not being harassed you're just being crushed by a fat man
wait he's trying geez there's got to be some commentary there I laughed because
um the TIE fighter sound is perfect there we go I did it I said it I like to think Patrick
Willems makes a TIE fighter sound in real life while he uh if not not while he walks
only if he's like flowing like if he's flung through the air he will make it trying to escape
like a bitch hey get your ass off of there oh shit
that's a nice looking window yeah yeah youtube harassment that's that is precisely what this is
get back here bird brain fucking re-uploading this is gonna be a nightmare they're gonna be
like no no no at least efap 49 59 is sacred and safe you know that's fine you're watching
I like that he had that tweet about like oh I don't regret saying watching movie wrongs
people taking out of context and I'm always just all like listening to it wrong or understanding
it wrong I'm just like what the hell did you mean by it it's not even the worst part of the video
and you guys want to say that it's not it's it's partly a joke it's like how could that
partly be a joke that doesn't make sense about space wizards intended patrol that's not a
oh my god vulture was a robot I guess so the music is on more of them all this song
uh
I couldn't even hear it maybe I'm like really stupid
I just love drinking directly from the couch oh they're right there there is a song and sort
of like blanking it out because I'm trying to listen for the quotes
how is it that this is happening to us but he managed to upload this video without
you'd think that would have gotten taken down with all the music or because they monetized it
uh
my guess is that it doesn't hit um that it hits streams with like a couple thousand people
watching harder than it hits like uploads that get I'm guessing like a hundred or so views on this
yeah I'm sorry mr. spoon awards man but um it's uh it's too risky we might argue we might get
flumpled ingust oh there's even more though like maybe this one doesn't have music
as in this other one I'm looking at I mean streams still up so
okay that kind of does have music
okay listen we can have damn it this is soundtrack what do I do I can't play it
that looks like a big tub of jello
beautiful I want to play more of a bit of super risky again
how I don't understand how the stream got paused for community whatever and then
yeah that's really weird I don't understand policy violation
all right I'm sorry we're not able to check this one out uh
there's one for um a status the thing for 40k I don't know if that has copyright on it either
my recommendation I mean that's that's a that's a fan thing that was made I don't know that works
I think just a lot of these that are more risky record them offline and
because you can't you can't get a strike for trying to upload something privately
you actually can oh you can if you upload say for example like a full episode of something
you'll just automatically get a strike just like hey we can see what you're doing all right but if
you but like if you upload something like this it's clearly as fair use and you can argue as
yeah all right I'm here I made it I think we had to skip over about three because the yeah
there are like there's lots of copy tisms um yeah we're not sure about this is like an
efap version of the 40k thing oh it's star test yeah I don't know if and look how well it's made
the the the image masking for a moment there oh so good yeah it's uh
I don't know if this will be here oh depth of field yeah
uh artificial power of blocks they did say this is uh fan made though so
it should be right yeah I hope they believe themselves to be warriors
in my subjective opinion
actual arguments
a review is nothing more than a description of an experience you're so titanically ugly
this is a film about space wizards intended for children
there's no arguments being made here
a gun the bark you're kind of watching movies wrong
oh wow
wow hello there ladies and gentlemen
this movie's a fucking mess whoa crosses that went well didn't it
apparently a bunch of people have that that went well didn't it as an audio clip from
he's just been in a few now
what was really cool is about that is that there's a there's a part where one of the space marines
eye lenses starts to crack from the pressure and he had that on the glasses and i was like oh wow
that's a good touch yeah and if this apparently this was made by one guy i didn't actually know
about it started go check it out start its 40k fan film um is this a corridor what's the channel
corridor digital is that who it is i don't know no they have an episode about it about how cool it
is but yeah just uh pretty good shit and uh there's a very that's a that's a really good meme
excellent work all right very good which pushes us on to uh more copyright risks
uh
i feel like you've been eternally scarred by that one feeling down
hi mauler i'm probably wolf and rags too don't you want to know what happened say hi to j
the dawn survived chilling like me because if these are going to be my last words then you're
gonna listen because the dicks about this too the doctor who stuff i got hit with bbc bbc pulled a
um i think i think a 15 minute video of mine because i played that minute trailer within it
with or without the audio and i took the time ball sex and pulled it into his head and turned
him into dust the god of all ether and i destroyed him this was on purpose this is
a genuine response to this kindly fuck you hey what's going on guys no no no no no no no
i love it i can only play it for seconds at a time but i keep forgetting just pause
like yeah that's me always that you are powerless how are you oh same old you know
would tonal really align himself with the tax and i don't know
and mickey mickey nice to see you sexual harassment
i envisioned myself as happy as i was the day diablo 2 came out i'd spend the next
six months in an orgasm you can you can watch this
what
wait they go down and get off for fuck's sake yeah
well i think the solution is probably to record it offline like a new like a mini i get
we might we did the doctor who ones before how come we're not alone i guess they've just got
it more anal about it or something they've you've i don't know you've drawn more attention to the
channel and now they're youtubin
some of the changes said copyright harassment i mean ironically yes it's not like with
as if this is even remotely the fucking original content you know stream suspended for policy
violations
oh there he goes back again that's so weird and now so the concern what is this the concern i have
is that maybe you get three chances to you know like three is the maximum time you can be suspended
before it takes the stream down fully so yeah my my guess is it's probably not a good idea to carry
on with them right now yeah because there's another
okay so we might do an efap mini form but i don't even know if i'll be able to upload them without
them being booped but we'll i guess we'll try well you put with being when you're uploading them you
basically get infinite tries to cut out footage they don't like it's all i have to actually do
it as a sort of um like put the efap logo over it you know what i mean like the same way we do
with batwoman yeah maybe that'll be the way we do it um all right well i guess we'll push on i'm
gonna have to i'll skip over any that have like because there's quite a few this one was so good
that's a shame because this one is really good sad faces all around
um this one shouldn't get copyright
like oh don't you care about the substance of wales politics or people you like no we have a cool
flag
what does it mean rax did you just did you just say is a sleigh of man what does it mean
you put it on the screen
it's too scary to explore
it's too scary to explore
i don't know where the stream is to see it
we don't want to keep it together
you can't you can't lose to the pilot
you can't lose to the pilot
you can't lose to the pilot
you can't lose to the pilot
you can't lose to the pilot
you can't lose to the pilot
you have to puff the weights to replace it with a foot
you call it a squat
three legs
three legs
if all of the flags were personified into creatures and made to fight
each other
oh the Welsh flag just looks like a three-legged creature
the Welsh flag will be just be confused
why do i have to fight this
i mean it's a drive-in
that's wearing armor
it's an armored leg that's true with stirrups
so it's ready to write some kind of
well not stirrups
what are they what are they called
they're all right legs
i just want to point out the super chat's relevant it's just a cheap swastika
the problem is you know they're one of those kids they're trying not to do their swastika pose
just to get it quite right
i feel like i would see that before that's amazing
that i remember that man
i remember that magical magical oh my goodness
that stream was so so amazing
this one should be okay
only small as long as i pause at least once
come on you try it no i couldn't yeah just breathe slowly and squeeze
i don't know if you guys have seen this episode but um what basically happens is this woman is
trying to get marge to be a little bit less like stiff with everything and uh she started to fire
a gun anyone seen this for i think a long time ago i don't remember can't remember it
marge ends up shooting some cans that have been just conveniently on this this this like a fence
whatever and as soon as she shoots the one of them this old man comes out he goes my antique cans
why did you get these shots of cans
i hit it i hit it my themes
look what you're done to him look what you're done to him
i love that it was bob i hope stream doesn't get suspended for that
oh yes another one that's immune to suspension woohoo
oh rex will you teach me to shoot bob's themes
yeah when a homeless person's murdered no one gives a flex journey of self-actualization
through realizing that while society can be tough the real cause of all of your problems is probably
a woman but because the same i am just i am baffled i am absolutely at a loss
completely there we don't even groundless no no evidence is supported my mouth is just open
i'm like a good idea
singapore will save us
watch because this is a movie that's only constructed to confer a
it's like he's an alien speaking some intergalactic language i don't understand
how could you even begin to think that's been hacked
that was awesome i love the art style that was fantastic i love it
singapore will save us
and it's true so this is e-man gameplay i'm pretty sure this is from a game trailer for a game
it's the right line so
wow is that a thing man
riser skywalker was still uh standing for a little bit there because we haven't yet been able
to check it out who knows how amazing it will be uh so jay you may be aware of this i believe you
may have seen it already it's it's quite the video you ready for this yes
oh no i've seen this one i'm aware of this
that's that's you why it's clearly in the film
it's like mass amnesia forgets it's like mass amnesia
who the fuck is this the fbi in the film
i can't do this
do
something that people can think
i'm literally gonna write that on my ego for like three years
where are you drinking from a geode is that a geode okay
did moxus do fuck
e-fat meme jay finally drinks rhino milk off a geode yeah okay yeah you drink it off a geode
so this is what you sent me jay because we kind of baffled that it was created
uh oh what is it it's fully original animation right well i guess we'll play it first
oh
crap won't you fight the frogs
It's not funny.
It's not funny.
Real slow for ya.
Round.
So you clarified right that's like an animation they made specific because of you.
I think so, yeah.
Like why?
I'm genuinely confused as to why someone went, you know what I'm going to do with my day?
But I like it. I like that decision.
I'm thankful for it. Then there is this legendary meme
And we all need to accept and enjoy
Tracer we're taking some time to construct this
I like that the community has sort of collectively decided that the place and I need to be kicked is my eyes
Yeah, they gave you the rhino bill too. It's very important part of your character
It's about family that's what's so great about it
You
Created by joss weeden. This is called now what makes good rat?
So I think it's like a documentary is very serious thing. I love documentaries
Hello there ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to a student's philosophical information
or aspie
Today on aspie. We'll be taking a look at a question. That's playing to the greatest
Please be generic music that can't be copyrighted. Please please please please
Minds in human history said beginning us in 429 b.c
makrisan tropus kakos
Translated we get the common philosophical question
What makes good rat?
Before we work on answering this question, we'll have to define our terms
first
What is?
good
Many scholars believe that what beginning is meant by good was reaching of a standard
But that's just their opinion. I choose to go with the third definition on google
possessing or displaying
virtuous
So now the question becomes what makes virtuous rat?
But what is virtuous?
Well to be virtuous is to have high moral standards
Obviously, there's only one definition of the word
however
What is a high moral standard?
after all
Voltaire teaches us that morality is subjective
in his book
By a big case
Often murder is acceptable in my known subjective opinion
This disproves objective analysis
Where does that leave us?
Well
We have to ask the question
What makes good rat in my opinion? This works to our advantage as it is a fact that everything is subjective
But what is an opinion?
Well for that we look to be giddiest teacher
That being mr. Freudian in a transcript of the 512 bc novel
Freudian tells us
Or the truth is the lie of belief
But what does this mean?
Well in my opinion
What he factually meant was that what we believe to be true
Is really just our opinion
And so we come back to our question
the question
That which has come to symbolize the divide between the upper and lower classes
What makes good rat?
Well
I think what be giddiest intended with this question was to spark this very discussion
To make us realize that objectivity does not exist as Bilbo Baggins once said
That will have to do for this episode of aspie
On screen are some of the people who inspired this video and I highly recommend their videos on philosophical tisms
I like it. It feels very inspired by gedelve actually. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
This weird point where i'm like, okay. I'm really kind of tired. Although we're just sort of
Just letting anything wash over me and that was
I was like, oh, okay. Oh
Yes
Beautiful. It seems this was very inspired. I think as well
So a quick disclaimer before we jump into the video
Everything that follows is just my opinion guys
Now I am going to make a number of objective claims in this video
But see what i'm doing now is i'm framing them all as my opinion so that you can't criticize me or say that i'm wrong
This is called the film you hate is actually genius and here's why dash npc reviews
Okay, so remember that this is just my opinion and you're not allowed to criticize me. Okay, are we clear?
All right, let's jump into the video that new movie you criticize is actually genius and you're a bad person if you don't like it
And also that old movie that you really like is problematic and you're a bad person if you still like it
What's worse?
I've noticed a lot of people online especially straight white men seem to be really mad about this new movie
So they're spewing their toxic hate claiming that their opinions are objective and anyone who likes the movie is wrong
Now I could spend time talking about the legitimate flaws and things that the movie doesn't do as well as it could
But honestly, no movie is perfect except for sorry to bother you because capitalism is evil
But really I don't want to fit into this idea that pop culture blockbusters are even to be taken seriously in the first place
Unless of course you really love them in which case they absolutely should be taken seriously and furthermore
There is no such thing as objectivity in art. There are only better and worse subjective opinions
Now to talk about how great this movie is I might have to get into spoiler territory
So here's your warning
If you don't want to hear me recap the entire plot in a boring and uninteresting manner then skip to this time code
So the movie starts with this and then this thing happens and this person says oh my god
That's crazy. And then this other thing happens and they're like, oh my goodness
And then this other thing happens and then she doesn't like that
So she says hey, you stop it
And then the movie's over now a lot of haters and the toxic families of this intellectual property have said that politics is ruining
This franchise what I say to that is boo hoo hoo
And besides everything is political. Therefore a good film is a film with good politics. See these new movies
Have the right politics the old movies
Let's just say they were a product of their time
But also you're not allowed to like them
There's time to change if you still like something that was a product of its time. That means you're evil
Now another thing these so-called critics won't stop harping about is the plot. They say the plot makes no sense
And to that I say
And there you go
And there you go one but really like any sane person i'm going to forgive little tiny holes in the plot
Because what really makes a movie is themes
Oh, thank god he's got papyrus
Now as anyone who actually studied the art of cinema and filmmaking knows
like me by the way good themes make good art regardless of how they're executed see this movie has really strong themes of
hope
and despair success and failure life and
Death now i'm going to quote an intellectual
Whether or not it's relevant to the topic at hand to show that my film studies degree wasn't a waste of time
As the analytical psychologist eric noimin once wrote all the objects of the outside and inside worlds are introjected
And are there represented according to their value the selection
Arrangement gradation and elimination of the contents so represented
And in large measure on the cultural canon within which consciousness develops and by which it is conditioned
But it is characteristic
Under all circumstances to create for himself a consciously constellated and synthetically constructed view of the world
however great or small in scope
See a smart person said that and I quoted them. So I am also smart by association
Now there is one last thing I should probably mention about criticisms of this movie and that's the character of blank
A lot of people think blank is a poorly written
unlikable
nothing of a character
And that's just wrong. I'm not going to explain why that's wrong
It just is but more importantly they criticize her for having no flaws and no obstacles to overcome
I don't buy the mary suit thing. Anyway, I found that I find the term sexist
You go girl now a lot of morally good people try to defend her saying that no
She does have flaws and obstacles to overcome
But i'm going to take kind of a bold stance here and say that it's good that she doesn't have any flaws or obstacles
To overcome you see blank is a insert minority group character
And if we said that insert minority group characters had flaws then we'd be saying that insert minority group were flawed
And that would be bigoted. I for one think
She has no flaws to overcome
Because it's showing this insert minority group community that they're perfect. Just the way they are
And on that note
That's all I have for you in this video. I'd like to thank my mega sexy patrons for supporting me my parents their parents
That wasn't real communism
Now I have become death
Michael brown house is funny
Mindless sick event. Oh, this is my favorite. Just right. Thank you skill share for sponsoring this video
If you like this video, please mail pallets of cash directly to my
Thanks for watching and always remember everything is objectively subjective so you're not allowed to criticize me
That was amazing
This is crazy who are very talented individual this only has 57 views this must change describing to you
This is a make by capital o opinions, yeah, oh my goodness, this is an amazing video. It's actually
I love this so much. It was very enjoyable and cathartic
Oh my goodness, I I would this is an amazing video after all of the apps that we've done
I feel like this is what we've watched like every week every week
Please mail pallets of cash to my house
I just like this skill. She's a rule
It's always skill share
Themes
Oh my god, we've experienced it soon. I'm a
Like the the themes thing hit it's just too it's too real
It's too real
Another bit where he's like i'm just gonna quote the fucking the whole bit was great
Make more content, please. I'm gonna watch it all. That's so good. Like that's so good
Uh, oh man that was inspired by just right
So
There's probably a few more image memes and video memes that I could show a lot of them the copyright ones that i'm concerned about
So I think the plan will be to try and collect them up and maybe do an efap mini forum
of some kind
Yeah, uh, see what you do with that
then
And i'll catch like any image memes i've missed
I will attempt to recapture them because I know i've got a bunch on twitter already
but um
platter
Yep, and some I really like too. They're looking looking pretty pretty sexy. It's pretty swag
Some of them i'm just i'm just gonna say like we're gonna push on to um
The super chats because i'm kind of
Edging tool trying to end this stream to see what kind of trouble my channel might be in hoping it's done
hooray
But um, you know, they're letting me be live right now. So that's reassuring. Yeah, that's cool
I love it when they let you do that
Yeah, it's very kind of them
But yeah j, I guess if you're um, if you're deleted in the head you're welcome to um, yeah
i'm probably gonna skip away and
Yes, yes
Bye toodles. Bye. Bye. Bye. Toodles. See ya
What a what a god now we can fucking party
All right. Let's do it. So there were two
Uh chats that we missed when we went went offline last night rags. Um, do you want to know what they are?
Say what there were two super chats that came in after we went offline last uh, well last you've happened. Oh, that's too bad
We gotta do you we must acquire them. I have um, would you like to know what the first one is?
I would yeah
gay
well
Fakers yeah fair enough good stuff. I ain't gonna say no to that
and then
Uh, we've got don't let jenny vote
Um raw it was raw that's i'm so sorry, but um
Uh, there's nothing we can do about this. It's a part of the law. She can vote. Um, he can vote not twice though
Definitely not twice just the once
Four points. Oh the uh, the pixel drawing I I showed was not uh
Yes, I think I said I I I got something mixed up i'm trying to keep track i've got a lot of messages right now
The toxic brood stats with you apparently there's some comments flowing in all that guy's video good stuff. Give me some love
It's good. You know, man, like that video really was legit. Excellent. Yeah, it was really good
And yeah, oh and this i've been getting messages people can sorry about the memes causing trouble. It's not your fault
It's never like I don't
We're not, you know, we know what we're doing with like playing them
But you never know sometimes something slipped through some the rules are always different literally the rules for each and every um
like individual meme individual video or piece of music like youtube is different with all them
like I said, it's really weird that we've got the um
um
We can play the avengers
You know like the marvel opening theme in full, uh from the films where they show like the um
The comics flowing like with pages you can play all of that for some reason and monetize it
yeah, you're not allowed to um
Play the avengers theme for longer than like I think it's like that might be 10 seconds or so, but um
Yeah, I know there's a there's an influx of new stuff. I can see it on the discord
Um, i'm gonna collect them up make sure I grab them. Uh, but for now, I think we're um
We're probably pretty good with five hours of just meme
Like the result was always good. Yeah, that's quite a bit. Yeah
um
Okay
Also, welcome back
Thank you. I am back now. Sorry about that. Hello
Oh you missed uh, you missed a great video i'll i'll send you it
Yeah, it's been an hour. I figured I was gonna miss something really good
Uh, we've sent people to it as well, but you should check it out at some point. It'll make you laugh
It's called the film you actually hate. Well, the film you hate is actually genius and here's why
Um, but yes good stuff. Everyone's gonna be keeping an eye on him for future mpc reviews
Okay
Uh, but metal how was the sex
Excuse me, that's the first stupid chat of this stream. James Moore wants to know how he sexes
Mm-hmm. Was it everything you hoped for and more?
It was like a three out of ten three out of ten
Oh, it could be with well, just wait till you try it with a girl. Oh you
Got him fucked up. That's gonna screw it up, right?
You gotta compare a girl's butt to a boy's butt
Two ephaps in a row also a message for death bullshit 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16, etc
Okay
I I don't get it. But don't worry
I have a series that i've made over the years and um, I I stopped at episode 15. Oh, you told my idiot box
Yeah, yeah. Oh, so before we get a lot of 16 requests, huh?
Uh, yeah
I had 10 minutes. I I felt really shitty about it. I I assure you
I mean we all do what we can
Patience is a virtue as as as she said in the mummy
That is true. People see the mummy's a good movie
Mummy is good
I had 10 minutes left on the last one you massives. That's right
You can play them both at the same time get that 10 minutes sorted and then play this one. It's all good
Uh, if he hasn't seen blade runner or lord of the rings
When are we gonna stop trying to save jay and take him out back like old yella also hi j?
Also
Uh
kick jab doe
No, never ever never kick a jab while he's down which is always
Hug jeb, this means never kick him
Uh, i'm gonna chafe my jab from all this efap and
Oh fapping kick j
Uh completely random question usually but it's calum a normal welsh name
I have no idea
uh
Doesn't even know I have no idea what the origins of of of the name is are all they could they could be from anywhere
oh
Also high regs
Hey
I should be getting into my new computer this month gang the end of the meme drought is upon us my friends
Excellent. That's from my presertory
though
Oh, yeah, they stream more than ever. It's just apparently
do what you can memers to
counter
copyright because
Yeah, because it'll hurt your meme when it's being played it will affect our ability to enjoy the meme
Oh, it was maybe you guys want to come up with
I don't like a like a list or pdf of approved music that you know stuff like that or try to use um
Like I know youtube has a huge library of stuff. That's cleared for copyright
Yeah, and then obviously when you want to reference movies, it's tough
because
I could pull this you might have to use like a
Different version of them or a parody of them because we we've loved a lot of the movie references and stuff
I'm just saying that like it gets if we get like a five minute meme video, that's all from a movie
It's going to take us a while to get through it and it'll often damage the pacing of jokes in it as well
Yeah
And funnily enough we had a guy
Do what was that like a three minute video of like paint drawings and we were laughing our ass off of it. So yeah, man
Don't like don't be too consider about making it like cinematic and stuff like we love all the effort everyone's putting in
It's just we're just really concerned about being able to show stuff in its natural form
in its raw form
Reviewers are saying the new terminator is actually good. Perhaps humanity does have a dark fate thoughts
Sad it's really bad
If anything it's gotten worse in my head more i've been thinking about it
um bad movie
Also salutations ragsimus
Hello salutations to you. And yeah, the pixel drawing I showed was not smile around. It was psa stitch. Uh
But there you go. It was like the all black figure with the the white
Uh face or white eyes and white teeth and it was like, oh, yeah, you can totally mix those up in pixel form
Uh me they took a week off I can get caught up more the frack you were doing a 12 hour on saturday and another one
On sunday we didn't mean to
intended accident
Hello guys, are there any film slash shows that you would consider nearly objectively perfect?
Um
No shows that i've watched that i've felt that way about
That is a really tough one because I don't watch a lot of shows and I don't watch a heck of a lot of movies either
The best we get is like seasons or episodes rather than a whole show
Probably episodes actually and then movies. There's a handful
That I struggle to find holes in
Um, but not many that I find to be 100 clean like they have small mistakes or something that
Are totally understandable for a massive production. Yeah
massive
Um, it's like well if you have a film that's really good and then you go
Ah, but they let's say lord of the rings to go. Oh, there's that car in the background one of the scenes like so that could
Have been prevented
Meaning theoretically possible. That's what I mean by that. Oh, yeah. Absolutely
I will okay. Yeah, I uh breaking bad. What about breaking bad?
I have plot issues with some of uh, I think season three or four of breaking bad
And I think some of the characters could have used
um
a little help like uh
Marie is a character that I look back on and i'm like, what was her journey of five seasons? She's a klepto
And annoying
There's not a lot going on with marie
Um, I love everything with walt pretty much. Uh, I think gust makes a couple of irrational decisions at certain points
Once, uh, the gangbangers are killed by walt
There's a couple of things
That thanks pretty great. Yeah
No, I was gonna say by the way the breaking bad is my pick for like best objectively a tv show
Like I don't need to come across one that has more consistent. Um
The production values in in most aspects buffy's my favorite but buffy's got a shit ton of problems
Um, they're just all in regards that don't damage my experience as in
Uh, the characters are all intact
For the most part. Yeah, for sure. Um
Band of brothers is probably a good suggestion actually. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's a fantastic tv show
Oh, yes, yeah people saying skyla
Yeah having her being annoying is one thing but
Is she inconsistent? Uh, we'd have to look through it all
saving power ryan is pretty damn good. Yeah saving power ryan's up there as well
I don't think she was really
Like as inconsistent as marie. I think marie is pretty bad. Um
But I feel like maybe skylar was maybe just a little more
Annoying than people would have liked, you know, it's all like
Constantly hounding the poor cancer guy who's obviously going through a hard time and everything
It's like I think they're kind of putting themselves in the seat like okay. Well, he's got a ton of cancer
Maybe I shouldn't treat him as much of crap as skylar did, you know got a ton of cancer
Yeah, he's got a ton of he's all over his cancer body. It's crazy. You can have different amounts of cancer. So
And once someone dies of cancer and they pull it all out of him put him a big bag the bag away a ton
That gets wrong
Uh, the suit absolutely is perfect. It will be when it fits jeb. Yeah, that's true batarangs calibrate themselves for him
About walking dead
Holy shit, the walking dead is terrible. Uh, it's like first season. Yeah, pretty good the rest. Uh, fuck off
Dances with jeb's. Hello all my jeb words
Rags, I want to look you in the eyes when you poop with the door open
I will not stop with these comments until my demands are met
All right, oh no, you will not stop skipping money. Is that a super is that a super chat?
It is every time that's an an unusual threat
um
but
I I know I know and it ain't about the money it ain't about the money
It's about a pretty helps but it's about the principle of I don't make eye contacts with people
Well, i'm fucking dropping a stink pickle. It ain't happening. All right
It's fair enough hi rags weird it's weird for me
Um any thoughts on the fitioria map?
Um
It's okay, um
I think that invasion could use quite a few tweaks the ending the the end section is way too easy for the attackers
And if defenders can just be really annoying with it by guarding the last villager
I don't like the emphasis on making a lot of players like nobles and super tall guards and stuff
The less super soldier characters that are available for play the better. Um
Um
It's okay, uh, definitely
Savable it's not like bad right now. It's just okay and it could be better. They need to readjust the last position especially
and um
That that's really my main concern with it. Maybe instead of giving especially now that the mortar on the uh
Wall point is gone
But they should take away the whole making people super powerful. I think it'd be better as well
And what I wish they'd given more cosmetics I think that's my big thing
Okay, uh
Sorry, this has been asked already haven't been called the last stream yet. No, I think that was entirely original as a question
I tapped myself out with the avatar super chat yesterday. So i'll just say hi all and thanks to the content heart you rags
Oh heart you
What do you guys think about the new?
Tyler riser
aka best thick girl
No idea what it is. I love it. Hey, it's a telly
A totally eight leah eight leah riser. Can you spell it for me real quick?
I will paste it to you so you can see it in its natural form
Um
Oh, I haven't played it it looks like a game
Yeah, it's like it's like a jrpg. I think I think I saw it pop up on steam sometime
the protagonist is
Pretty thick. All right
Yeah, she's pretty lovely
definitely lovely
Also chat can I get a panda rau panda rau also I need this five dollars for rent
Oh
Well rip well
Well, what's more important living someplace or giving super chats to us?
Uh, please tell me you're showing efap the movie part one today
I would love to see reactions to jay getting redacted for youtube super chat
um if that's that so
Is that the one that's like 17 minutes?
Yeah, yeah, um, i'm not saying there's a time limit like memes
But 17 minutes starts to get super long man for memes and um, we've got like millions to get through
oftentimes
so like 17 minutes is a
pretty long really long
Yeah, um, like I don't want to discourage anybody from doing whatever they want to do and everything but
um
We like
Like joke heavy short and sweet angled memes instead of like super long movie long narratives or anything
Like don't you don't need to worry yourselves and making like an actual movie out of
uh
Stuffed stuff. Yeah
I have it on the tab. I will watch it
More the long man batting people level five of you laughs are infectious. Hi wags
Hello
I think the t-800 named himself carl
All right
Is that supposed to help it I don't I don't know actually I guess he saw someone named carl in tv and he was like
I'll call myself carl. I'll be carl carl is the name I will use
Also, would the movie be better in any way if the t-800 named himself jab instead of oh, yes. Oh, yes better
Oh, that would be so good
Best of the series
You're not allowed to insult efap if you haven't seen every episode and I knew batwoman would be a terrible show from the crossover
episode before the show started kick rags hi j
Oh
Oh, well, that's oh
Ban you from chat. Um
Yeah, that's sort of about the weird ass logic. Like you can't criticize batwoman episodes of having seen all of them
It's like no you haven't seen them either, but you've come to the conclusion that they're amazing. So
Um, what now maybe maybe they have it. Maybe they're like no, it's actually terrible, but i'm not gonna say until it's over
Marriage is between a man and a woman or two dudes
Okay, all right, I agree it's either one of those well, what about a woman and a woman
No, no not allowed doesn't count
Uh put j in the kick tier
Oh
No country for old jab
You fap we all fap together no
Uh chase face came up with long man bad from making fun of jack chase face has a long man bad origin. Nice
Hmm he does. Um, I don't know. Yeah, I do
Tonal tier is beyond the barriers of blockage
Yes
Uh wolfs retired last street made me fail. No, not november. Oh, no
So, sorry, I was always next year quick play
I don't know what jeb's theme would be the benny hill theme. I don't
I mean while he's running on his little mouse wheel
Yeah
Jay's on his redemption arc. He's the spike of efap villains. Yes, very true
Be wary for the efap is long and full of massives
Game of thrones
Where would you put us massives in the chat on the list?
Oh if chat got onto the list
in terms of
Um
It's not a bad question. Actually. I actually like that question. I mean a lot of the time they're the ones that essentially
Enable the meme to live they breathe the life. Yeah
It's almost like ranking them as hmm
I mean, I guess i'd say
Hmm
That's tough. I mean like there was a lot of great jeb memes like yesterday, you know, they kept going
Like they can decide whether or not a meme lives or dies basically
Yeah, does he ask the audience?
I feel like they they they are outside of the list almost or they are the list
Yeah, it feels odd to rank them
It really does and it's we're not trying to like like cop out of the answer
It just seems like a really odd thing to rate
I mean without the chat the whole list couldn't exist really
It sounds like it was suggesting a tier list for every single member who watched efap
Oh, so 3000 entries cool
Uh, so we recognize code gas in an old efap. I was wondering what your opinions were about the show
I liked it. I thought it was pretty good. I thought there was some tisms in it
Um still haven't seen it code you would also like to recommend wim book to wolf
I will save that comment
On the next I shall visit his tisms. I shall uh, let him know
Go here
Um
I'm surprised big jack films isn't on the list
Big jack films jack films
That doesn't sound like someone we've covered if we did I maybe I didn't realize um, yo that reminds me was fat man falling even on that list
No, but we haven't really covered them. We covered a portion of the podcast
He appeared on I don't know if that counts
I don't know
I don't think it takes more to be an efap villain
At least I think so. It looks obviously we covered uh, we we put angry joe up on there
But I think we would have been happy like fine if he wasn't there
Because we yeah bits
Uh, jim sterling should be in should be in b because he's too big to fit in with all the people in c
At the time of writing also, I can't type fat
You can't type fat
Oh man, that's fucked up
Really you can't type fat because he typed f at t to say fat
So youtube blocks him from saying fat, I don't know maybe
Wow, it is pretty offensive
It is pretty offensive
The hardest choices require the strongest jabs
yep
Please do jabs tlj video before episode nine comes
Oh, they mean jenny's oh
Jenny was tough man
Yeah, like jeb helped us through that stream
big time
a meme like weapon
And yeah, like uh, you know, this is possible
There's so many different streams we've got to get done before uh episode nine comes out and ruins everything because that's just gonna be
There's like another two joker streams. I want to do
Really? I want to do a dark fate one too. And this isn't even including all the ones that are like guest specific. So
woof
Plus you still got you still got uh jack saint naret taxon's video to cover at some point. Oh the the new taxon video
Yeah, I mean that's not too much of a worry like but the
The other ones gotta get them done. I want to talk about more more, you know
There's gotta be a joker takeout there. That's not as terrible as uh jenny's, right? So yeah
There's gotta be yeah extra credits didn't ask for the a tier they didn't choose it
As yet
Tell wolf he is missed. Oh, I think after the preview the stream last night. He's very aware
Oh, yeah
I recently discovered efap and i'm simply in love with rags too. Obviously, is it too much? Oh, that's great
Uh, is it too much to ask for my name to be in the mooler archive?
If not, you have to say it correctly though. Have my peasant student money. Love you mooler archive
Oh
What's the mooler archive?
Um, I mean I could say it it's yohan lund or yohan lund I guess um
But yeah, I guess that puts it in the mooler archive to a degree
uh put jenny nickels on the error rank above s or a
I like that everybody was very invested in how those places were placed even we were you know, getting those accuracy important
Why are we ranking brown table treesicles up next? Oh my god
There's no man gaming equals stakes were ruined. Olive is a weird grape
That uh that the hell is a cherry tomato
Oh the cherry tomato thing. I remember that that didn't last though
You know the memes are like hunger games like they fight each other
It's crazy like some of them just don't make it
Like it's like I told you jay was very happy that um, island man made it and it's very strong
But he was very upset that uh, aids bus died
Poor guy
It lived on a little bit on my stream though
I don't even know if I remember aids bus
Oh, it was uh to do with um, oh wait was rags there for that then i'm assuming it was it was the
I mean it was the palm of arty right
Was it eve of gaming 3 or was it just a stream?
Uh
No, I don't know i'm not sure anymore not sure anymore
What about jared? He practically created efap memes. I I think what wasn't the creation of efap means goes to um
Kyle ben wasn't that the first big significant meme i'm not saying it's the first meme, but
He was the one that kicked off the channel
Uh in my discord as well as like cataloging memes. So
I'd like to think because memes existed well before all of us, you know memes they've been around since cavemen could scratch on walls
Yeah, it's like I said before I think the very first meme I ever dealt with before was before the internet was around
That was the I've fallen and I can't get up thing
I'm sure i've mentioned that before that was a meme through like radio and television and shit before there was kill roy
We have like lots lots lots of super chats left because i've been getting a bit tired myself
No, actually, uh, this should probably take about half an hour. Um, no, no, that's fun. Oh, wow. Really?
Yeah, I mean it's this only half an hour to read all over super
Yeah, it depends on what questions we get. Uh, list is missing eric butts and sore e-sports
Eric butts isn't a villain eric butts is no he's a sweetheart. He's just a sad person. He's just a really really sad adult human
Let him have fun with episode nine trailers. All right
And i'm not sure who's sorry sports is that could be one of the
Maybe podcast eric is eric is a villain in the sense that he's why star wars get now
Yes
He's the audience they're appealing to
Uh, he is like fucking fat ass seals who will clap at anything
That took way longer than expected more. Yes. I mean
You never know with memes
Surprised to be sure still learning to be electrician if the circuit for my bathroom outlet is objectively not ground fault protected
But I subjectively believe it is can I drop a toaster into my bathtub and survive?
Trying I mean if it's all subjective
Wait, didn't didn't mythbusters actually cover whether or not a toaster in a bathtub will kill you and it actually was proven false
It seems like something they would cover
Um, but I always thought that it was like a known thing that that would definitely kill you
I thought that was like certain
Yeah, because it's like that's been a meme in everything for yeah
Like it's been in movies and I thought movies like that's something that I would never do. Yeah
Yeah, I don't know. I remember watching the mythbusters and it's like it didn't I like it didn't kill
And then like something else happened that it did. How did they test that then?
I'm well, you could you could measure the the voltage of liquids
Using my computers and stuff, but I and then you could see how much it takes to kill a human
I figured we knew that part. I thought that they wanted they were curious. They could put a baboon in the bath. Oh, geez
Balls you except maybe it might not
um
brown table son of tola to let tonaled sexual be thy harassment
Petition to rename the second top tier jab like
Well
Jeb like a jeb like weapon the gripper army versus dan crenshaw to noronite watch america first with nick fuentes nicker out
I don't I don't even know what grope. What is a gripper? I keep I heard that we heard that on the stream. Is that like a
Weird zoomer thing or what?
It's something must be a collective name for somebody
I guess
Nick went as his name
Grrr
I don't know. I guess maybe some of the chat. Tell me what a gripper is so that when it's mentioned in the future
I know what it means
Uh, my little jab gi jab the jabinator
What makes good orphan?
Unicorns are just massive rhinos true gears five sucks because fuck women
Okay, someone's saying oh someone's saying in the chat they found out that the drain grounded the tub
Uh, or grounded the water. So I think we're shocked that dummy. Oh
Does okay man science is fucking cool, dude
That's the big game. So if you were like in a hmm interesting, is there a scenario?
What about like old-timey?
I say old-timey tub as if they had toasters as well, but you could have an older tub like in future
Yeah, old tub. Yeah, you can have an old tub. That's got like the legs on the bottom the legs, you know a little bitty leg tisms
Uh
Also says the last word is censored
I guess oh when it said fuck women it just says f women. No, no, it's like an in joke. The last word is
Censored. Oh, he's five stars because fuck women censored
Oh also that uh, if you were dating a guy or girl and it's all going great
But then you discover they have a giant porg in their bed. Do you stay or run?
Fuck the porg to assert dominance. Yeah, you need to take away. It's uh, it's alpha nature, you know
But there also would be like oh so uh
You like last gen i huh?
Just like that's cool. That's cool. Just yeah. All right neat neat
Well, it's it's very very possible that they hate the last jedi
But they just think that porgs are cute
We did have that super chat of the guy who said he had one of those things because he won it and he was trying
To get rid of it and couldn't so
Like I said, man, just burn it up. It'll be pretty cool burn it burn it
But hell say you have bush inside
Okay, yeah, always take care and check. There's not a you know
That's the trash doing anyone has ever shot in the head. They take the jab with them
Um, oh
Yeah, it's really it's really a double murder every time someone's shot in the head
It should they should be tried as a double murder because it's really screwed up when people die and the jabs crawl out
But you need that to happen. It's a natural thing
This is honestly. Yeah, they live in the forest
A little jab community, uh, also I thought it was spelt porg, but apparently that is something else entirely not intended for children. Yes
Hey molar in the tree I sent you for the last name I included every reference
Oh for the um for the the smash brothers image. Uh, I think we we probably got most of them
I imagine uh, very very good stuff because I didn't miss anybody and there were sums that we didn't mention
But I certainly saw them all and I was legitimately impressed with not just how many there were but
A lot of the times they were if possible like thematically related to the character that their, you know, head was on
Although i'd still really like to know who was in samus's armor
Yeah, I oh, yeah, who is in samus's armor? Uh
Because I I couldn't really see is a
Big image. It was well. Yeah, and that like the helmet visor was like really narrow too. So what we could really see is the eyes
Yeah, I was gonna say my twitch is kind of stacked right now
Uh, yeah
I will if I if I get a chance to snatch it up. I will that uh, that info
hmm, uh
Oh, where am I so many taps?
Um zombie land was meh go see it if you want more of the same jokes that run on too long a rushed third act
And a bill mary scene that's worth the ticket
Oh, you mean for the first one
Because uh, yeah, I thought the first one was okay
I haven't seen the second one. Yeah, it's fine
Haven't seen the second one
ER is the smash logo. Perfect. Ah
Yes
I started the first episode of bat bitch. Wow, and I was so close to angrily shitting Italian dressing diarrhea that I had to turn it off
Here's for your suffrage not yours
I imagine what that would taste like
The visual came to mind as you sit there in front of the
You don't want to write over a salad
You don't want to watch the show. Okay, just watch our coverage. You'll be fine. Just watch our don't watch the show
Watch us watching save yourself. Don't hit like, you know self-harm
Uh, that beautiful story rags red reminded me of a story just as beautiful called gay bigfoot a mouthful of sasquatch
I could I could I would imagine there would be some some similarities there. Oh, yeah, definitely
Uh, what's your opinion on watchdogs? I love the game
Oh games never played it. I never played watchdogs
Uh, the first watchdogs was really repetitive and stuff
The second watchdogs was actually pretty decent
The stealth was kind of garbage in the sense that once you took somebody down in a non-lethal way you cannot move the bodies
That's a problem because the guys can see the goddamn body. So it like
Kind of almost unincentivized doing non-lethal in certain ways, but you can like slip through anyway watchdogs too was pretty good
It was a good attempt to uh
You know make watchdogs one like less
Terrible, I guess
I've played them both
Uh, so I had a dream last night wherein I experienced the same story repeatedly with the ability to make different choices and see different outcomes
Madam madon gameplay literally crept into my dream. Oh, no
I'm, so sorry
Was it really that bad that that implies the choices like matter in any way most of them don't
It's more to do. I hate that one. Everyone's like, oh, yeah, here's a choice
And then the choices don't mean anything and they just lead to the same conclusion
I'm actually totally being harsher than you realize what i'm trying to say is like
When I say they matter in games like that what I mean is events actually change in this whole game
Most of it just goes the same for example
It's like hide here or run and then you choose hide and then the guy goes
And then you go. Oh my god and start running away instead of just running
You're like, yeah, oh, yeah, just fucking pointless
This is where we just play the cutscene and um, yeah
It's the same thing as like decisions that don't like that that creates
Um that create a consequence that you couldn't have possibly seen happening. That's something that's completely irrelevant to what you did
Yeah, the best example I've got man is the uh, I was playing with alex
He had a he was chasing after a girl who was screaming
And it said you can take the fast path or the safe path and I was like, oh that's obviously a uh, fucking
It's practically a dog whistle for you're gonna die if you go the fast path. You're like, okay safe safe fine
Then it's like you're too slow. She's dead
You're like, oh
And then if you chose fast and it died because you didn't go the safe path
Just like what the fuck am I playing this like this sucks?
Yeah, and it's it's not enough to be like fast and safe. It's like
Okay, that could go a number of ways who knows
The uh, there was a choice in The Walking Dead the first chapter of the game, um
Where you go to Herschel's farm and spoilers who haven't played the first one, but
Yeah, it's like
You're supposed to like either like make Herschel happy or make his son happy
And then like, you know, you'll do something for Herschel that says Herschel will remember that
But no matter what you do Herschel dies like like a minute later
It's like oh cool. I can't I can't help but notice you're saying you're you say like a lot but you don't compare to things
Huh
Is that it wait what
It's right counting on the fact that you use that's great. So you use like
You say like a lot but you never compare to things
It's a strength. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just kind of using verbal crutches my bad
Rags probably knew that and he just wanted to make the joke tripling or something
Um
Also, someone said how uh question dog whistle and I was like, oh did I use that wrong and I guess technically because it's more
More typically these days used about politics. I just meant a message that was concealed to a degree
That only ah, that's what I meant. So like a subtle push toward that's probably what I meant to say instead
um
All trannies want are equal rights and far lefts
All right
I put more the commander above maiden personally
Oh, no, somebody corrected me Herschel doesn't die his son dies and then just boots you off the farm and he never returns to
the game, okay
either way
Tism and or cousins tism and or
All right, fair enough episode nine is almost upon us hashtag toxic brood unite
Hashtag toxic brood unite. Absolutely toxic broods rise up
Good night. My toxic broods supple you massives just finished watching the last efap at work
It was nice seeing a fellow wolf returned to efap also high rags and kicked you. Hello. Hey got in the correct order
Yeah, I keep checking thumb wars nine the thighs of sky skipper
Okay, the thighs of sky skipper sky skipper rags rambunctiously rescues romanians rushing russia
Not nice
The enemy of my enemy howdy all question is a channel trailer good to have if so
Should I do an accent or would that end up being misleading?
Also, hi rags an accident. Oh, I don't know why you would do an accent. I don't see the need
Yeah, I don't know why I mean I obviously everyone has an accent, but I don't I don't know why you would do an accent
Assuming it's not your at all
Yeah, unless you were doing a really specific bit
But then the point of the channel trailers is to show what the channel is all about right
All the channel is about being a character of some kind I guess
yeah, would you be
Playing a character or doing some kind of a joke or
Yeah, if you're just doing standard good old-fashioned you're doing x content and you can just keep the near the voice the same should be fine
We framed it made it seem like it would do something out of the ordinary like make an accent and then just never do it again
In the other videos, so it's like well. No, I don't see the point
Uh, can we get jay to do a fireside reading of all efap memes and lore behind them have him dress up in a house coat
monocle and pipe buy wags
Um
Goodbye. Um, I mean, I think he'd be on board with that
If he if he goes through the the the lore and behind the meme section of the efap website and just explains the history
While holding a book
Yeah, more like can I still like the godzilla king of the monsters? It's okay
No
Yeah, you can still like it, but it's not okay. It's terrible. It's not okay
Um still like it though, don't worry has rag seen the patrician taxon video on him. If so, is he planning a response?
Response may be on efap, but like on a long time. It's not worth
anything really
Yeah, I think um
Nobody so like with the tro video we had a portion of the community telling us over and over again
Like you know, do you have response for these claims like the the arguments you're not really addressing it and it was always just like
Okay, fine. We will we finally did and then it was like, why did you guys think this had any fucking credibility at all?
And I think because of that and the jack saint video that we we are becoming less and less required for
For people to see our response. They can watch the video be like, okay
Yeah
just
I mean i've said this before but the biggest bane toward a lot of these video essays the efap
Provides as we listen to them. It's like whoa
Because a lot of people watch videos on youtube these days while doing something else and that's totally okay
But a lot of the time you miss what people are saying
When you stretch them out sentence by sentence you get stuff like is the theme of this movie that people shouldn't take medication
And your eyes widen like wow
Uh maula look at jenny's video again
It has people from your previous stream and they're shattering her glass house argument about joker
Um
People are going to comment on it. She has a huge audience. So probably not that noticeable, but you know, be nice
It's
jebby nickels like
Was silly said silly things. She's not bright, but she's not like evil. So just don't worry about it
Yeah, don't worry. Don't harass. It's like within a lot of the news
Yeah, don't harass just let it tism in peace
But you're welcome to obviously disagree with her and provide a counter argument or say you didn't like the video and everything just to
Don't be throwing insults
That's the last thing you need because then you get screen shotted quoted and you'll be you'll be see
This is what maulers fans do and that comes back on us
The last thing you need to do is be like those efap people fucking know
Uh, the copyright violations it's over nine thousand man. You went with that instead of 1.2 billion, really
Yeah, I was about to say damn. We have our own memes. We don't need nine thousand
Yeah
Moreland now the stream has a goofy pause in the middle of the efap stream because of the violation
I mean, I don't know what usually they stitch them back together. So hopefully it's uh,
So a violation did happen two of them
Ooh, the stream got paused twice. I don't know exactly what damage that's going to do in post
Um, the previous efap is ready to go up. I'll probably put it up as soon as this one's done
This one might be delayed to say the least
Uh
Where are we going here?
Thanos used the reality stone to bring back the stream. Oh, that's kind of him. It's nice
YouTube being massive true
Uh, i'm laying down on my couch watching efap and all of a sudden it's suspended and I swear to the cosmic chicken
I was about to build a roof just for youtube if the stream didn't come back online
Build a roof
Don't worry he'll stay for a what 10 hours later yep
Completely innocent question will telling youtube that efap is a five star content have negative content consequences for you
No idea when you when you're asked to rate streams or
I don't know what the fuck that does. I don't know if it does anything
YouTube are
More than likely having it just for interaction stuff. I don't know if they actually look at it, but um
Do whatever you want. I I doubt they look at it
Yeah, anyways, thanks for sharing many fun memes. Have a great week. Don't bless. Thank you very much. Don't bless
Don't bless. Oh don't bless do you do
Why not have the people who create these memes pause every few seconds in their actual videos
I mean
I don't think they're gonna want to do that
But yeah, it's just when you make a meme, please be aware that if you use copyrighted material
We can't play it on stream and it's not that we don't appreciate it
But by now we are kind of hoping that you understand that
Yeah, I mean honestly as everyone's fully aware after those two suspensions. We're very concerned now
This is the closest we've come to having efap being knocked off completely and we don't want that. I don't think you guys want it either
Um, so do what you can. Um
What is this the gorka podcast four minute breaks?
Um, I don't know. I hope not
YouTube violation, huh? Ra get the roof
Oh
People really need that roof
After watching rlm's dark fate review. I realized that they are efap
They are efap will be another 15 years of suffering and cynicism continued in part two
Uh part two red. Let me just auto separates the beloved original film
Films of franchises from what comes nowadays. That's why they tolerate the rubbish more
So i've seen the first half of the dark fate one. I thought it was really interesting
That jay said something like um, you can either judge this as a film or as a sequel to terminator two
And I was like it is a sequel to terminator two. Yeah, so it's kind of a strange film
How do you judge the film without this terminator one and two when the film relies on all the information of terminator one and two?
Especially when it starts with like the two characters
Like uh
uh
Like i'm not saying you can't like it's not possible
You can totally do it
But I don't understand how you can make comments about plot when you're missing several pieces of key information
And you assume a lot like it's weird to me
It is strange. That is a very strange like good luck judging riser skywalker as a film on its own. That's gonna be garbage
Like don't consider episodes one two, three four five six seven eight nine. Well, yeah, don't even consider itself
um
Gets copyrighted for grade a under a for style. That was the paid video
Um, I have to think this takedown thing is new because when I uploaded the dr
Who meme it didn't show claimed material until the last minute. Sorry to put y'all at risk though
Yeah again, man. It's okay. I don't think anybody intends for this to happen. It's just youtube being tismy or at least yeah
the people who
Re at youtube as in like bbc and whoever else zephyr and stuff
Mm-hmm, uh, this is for jay. I think he's cute
Well, there you go. Jay
Yeah, you left before you could say that
Good night. Jay. Good work. Sleep. Well, we'll most likely kick you in the morning. Oh
Jay is the apex bundle of sticks
Thank you so much for featuring my video love making y'all laugh bonus memes for any masses that translate he said love making
Translate the greek
Translate the greek, you know, did he say something to you? Oh it was um
It was the the one the the what makes good rat I think you mean at the very end
I think so. No, that's the japanese at the very end. All right. Yeah. Uh, well either way there was there was some greek in there
All right, there was definitely greek. I
But yeah, man, I just i'm gonna rely on you to have translated it properly
I yes, uh, i'm not good with my greek a little bit rusty. Honestly
It's all greek to me. Mm-hmm
Uh
Das well played make an efap meme using your bobby will never be mlg video but replace peggy hill at the end with jay
Since you uh, since he left before you got back
I get it. Nobody else does but I do I give it a thumbs up if you get it
I agree. That was thumbs in the middle
It's godzilla's birthday acknowledge this
Happy birthday godzilla. Happy birthday godzilla. I hope your next film isn't shit. You did it. Please don't kill me
You're older. You did it. You're the king of the mansters
Uh sounds like you need to step up your game with him mauler metal has high standards for a flop dingus. Apparently
I did everything I could. What can I say?
He's an alien gave him all of the alcohols and he still wasn't satisfied. Yeah, I was hacked. Sorry. He was hacked
Um, oh hi das. You missed the shad man shader man
Shader man. I think the shad
And rag wolfs and rag wolfs
Oh, hello i'm part of rag wolfs
Missed the live reaction to my drawing but I want to thank you guys for all the work you do p.s
Thoughts on angel's egg if any of you have seen it
Who angels don't know what that is
No, I don't know what that is. Yeah
Is that like?
Uh angel is angel the show and like an egg is like a plot device or something
Awesome, I don't know that is not heard of it though
Hmm passion of the jeb
Angel in chains or nirvana. I don't listen to either
Maybe he meant say alice. Was it is it supposed to be like alice and chains? Oh alice and chains
You said angel in my bag alice and chains on nirvana, yes
Yeah, um, I don't know anything about alice and chains
I don't know anything about alice and chains and i'm just sick to goddamn death in nirvana because back in seattle
Like they would play smells like teen spirit at least 10 times a day on the radio and i'm just so goddamn done with it
Anyway, but that's just my but that's just my angel's egg is an anime movie. Apparently. I have no idea. Never heard of it
Star Wars that star wars gill is samus in that image and oh
Okay, uh, they they're looking for a link to the isle of man meme cartoon video
Uh, so whenever we look at the videos, you can see their names in the top left
Uh, so that'll be a quickest route though. I will link uh, that one in the description with the other two, I guess
um
Like I said, you could always find them through their names
um
If I can have a look quickly and see what the name of it is
It's called maula succumbs to the leg and the channel is bad mems
Bad mems spelled m-e-m-s
Normally, I just let this go but given the time that went into the original
I think i'll make an altered cut for the meme that you might be able to show
um
Yeah, man, like uh, we let me know
Like on twitter and like I said, we'll try i'll try and collect up a bunch that'll have to be done for an efap mini
And uh, we can just do some editing
Yes goliath saga 2 will be 95 to 100
Copyright free audio as well as the footage being very re-edited. So that should help the copyright situation. That's from meme repository
Good shit fat. Wait, what the fuck youtube does, uh, just block random combinations of words
Well, it's weird because some people were saying fat just to test it and it went through
Maybe it's just not for super chats
Maybe it's like algorithms or shit
The theory now is that it's that word plus another word or something or in the right order in some way
It must be something. I just said it just now. No, you didn't
Oh damn that's phat is different
Oh fat
Hello fellows. Have you considered playing the forest for efap gaming?
I have played the forest uh quite a bit and I enjoyed it
I have too. I completed it
I had actually played it while it wasn't finished yet
And then they released an update to where it had like a finished storyline. There's a storyline in that game
It's kind of cool. I haven't played it in a while. I need to go back. Take a look. I know
What a consideration. I I kind of like that idea to be honest with you. Uh, yeah
The score e-sports was the okay sign is not okay vid
Oh, so oh
Yeah
That happened guys
That was a thing the okay sign is not okay. There are people who think that the okay sign means you're
Racist and you're a white supremacist. That's the world we live in. It's like of course
You know a green frog is racist. Like I understand that but okay sign. Okay
Take a minute
Nope, you're a racist. You hate black people if you play the circle game, isn't that nuts?
It's like you got you got the sign that's been around forever
But suddenly you're just gonna hand it over to the so-called white supremacists. Just oh if they use a gesture
Just give it to them. Yeah, like yeah not way to not give in
Supremacist start drinking water a lot publicly you guys will be great. Oh
They said about milk
I guess you don't want healthy bones then. Fuck you. That's white supremacy talking white supremacy
um
And yeah about the whole fat thing. I think there's the rules for super chats and chat are different
Like, uh, I don't know what difference there is, but there's some kind of difference
Um, I can hear everyone do. Oh wait, can I hear everyone do a fake laugh? Good old good and bad
so
so like
Who goes first?
Um, we'll go from left to right mauler can be first
Uh, that's like right to left. Okay, fine. I mean for people watching. Oh, I guess. Oh, yeah
I guess it's different for everyone. Yeah
Fine i'll go so like it says good and bad. So like a good fake laugh is a bad. What would that mean like believable?
Yeah, the best fake laugh you can do and like a clearly fake laugh so the clearly fake won't be like
a
Almost sarcastic
It's like straddling the line, you know, like oof
then a a fake laugh
That I can you can generate without actually laughing and be like
You like hopefully no one actually paid attention to that because I didn't really try that sort of that sort of
I would have done the exact same thing. Did you just did? Yeah
Just like yeah
Yeah, anyone else want to do that takes
Next up is dash. Bullshit
Oh, okay
um
So the fake laugh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
That was that was pretty bad, right?
Yeah, you get a lot of breath. That's something I noticed too
I'm not trying to stall but I notice a lot of actors have trouble with laughing and coughing
It's like none of them like so few of them can get it, right? All right. So let me try, uh to
Do the do something real here
All right, there you go
I mean the goal with the good fake laugh is probably to make us all go was that real?
Was that fake? Yeah, like that's the sort of yeah
And you'd think that with mauler and myself especially you'd have plenty of
laugh laugh ins
But I get i'm next up on the list. So for my fake laugh
we could do a
Ha ha
Like tightest from final fantasy 10
And then I guess for a real laugh, let me see sorry, let me take some more beer
Retaken it
Right at the butt the beer and a beer enema goes in faster. Yeah, and it goes it gets into the blood system quicker
Is that how that's how it works? All right, let me see I guess I was gonna real laugh
And see I think that we're nailing it because all these laughs
You do like the the eyes where you like sort of squint and you're like was that you
Well, yeah, that's the thing with in when you you can see people laugh you can like a real laugh your eyes
squint together and your cheeks curl up and you know you
But but when it's just sound it's a lot easier to hide when it's sound
Sound only audio only that leaves metal bilge
I mean, I already did the the tightest one was like ha ha ha yeah, but this is a really bad one
You'd actually do that. Oh, no, that that that was that's your real last before so he goes
Yeah
It's like so I don't want
Like uh, you know what we should do you finish up your thing and then I have a suggestion for us
Okay
Do you yeah, he's done. Yeah
All right. Um
We need to do all of us at the same time doing it
Why so we're like they're like ending up together now because I can't remember what I did
Well, it'll be fine if if they wanted to have all of us so all of us could
Do the fake laugh and then we could do the real laugh
So that way they could just but they're all fake
We're closing a sitcom, baby. Well one sounds
Yeah, then there'd be other people would want to use the audio
Yeah, fine. If you don't want to fucking laugh, it's fine. Just say you know what?
I think I'm laughed enough today rags. I think I think we've been laughing enough today enough chuckles for the evening
I liked the idea
Yeah, it's a pretty fucking amazing idea
But you know, I I guess we're not doing it and now we can't do it for real because i'm so upset
That I can't laugh for real. So now what now what metal you did this you want to hear me cry for real. Yeah
Wait, look what you did. Look what you did to dad. Why me?
Why you yeah
Yeah, that's what I thought
I'm i'm i'm temple nudging my myself right now temple nudging. Yes
I've not been to that country
Oh
Wait, what I don't know what's happening anymore. I'm gonna continue. Yeah, but just just
move

I just hypocritical like versions of ourselves be like I guess just like us but

Did some kind of interstellar like thing where we talk about how love will save us love will carry us through
What is a force that goes beyond life?
We would we would be a podcast that talks about the movies themes and the messages and we'd be very lefty
politically and

We wouldn't be able to tell like any of these jokes because there'd be some
You'll never know when we'll actually like a film like a film comes out you watch it
You'll be like, oh, yeah, these guys will either not like it you'll just watch our podcast like did they?
No, no, okay. They didn't
Because yeah, we can talk about a movie. Also our podcast would be like 40 minutes most

Hi rags
Hey, please assert your dominance over my giant porg over and over and over and over wipes drool off keyboard
Okay
I don't know if I can
Uh, can we all agree that battle angel was objectively good?
I know that fringy and wolf will have wids with the person who says that i'm afraid i'm afraid I never saw it
I did see it, but i've already mostly forgotten it. I didn't really enjoy that much
Um, imagine trump saying we need to build a roof
Yeah, yeah swat cats equals rag wolfs also er again when
Swat cats equals rag wolfs
All right, wasn't swat cats like a cartoon or something?
It was back in the 90s

Okay, I followed also er again when um, we'll probably have er back at some point
We'll see I know you said he'd be up for it. We just got to find the right topics and stuff
Yeah, we just got to find something. He's really familiar with a water the plant that is er
Water the plant. Um, I guess spooter wars is cancelled. I thankful that you all enjoyed this saga of spiders
Thank you all very much. Yeah, uh, I don't know why
they
Decided to shit on that one specifically, but youtube is changing its tisms, I guess
So wait a minute, huh?
You know, well, we've watched spider wars for ages or spooter wars and for some reason this is the first one where it was like
All right, I guess it was the music in the background. I don't know
Oh the meme. Okay. I was about to say like
It sounded like he was saying spider man into the spider verse 2 was cancelled or something and I got no
No, no, no, no. No, that's i'm sure that's good
Also, there's only four left and then we'll probably read that tweet if you want race because that sounds interesting
Everybody at the same time do dsp's laugh

um
Stars nine c3po anthony daniels reveals his disappointment with the new films
Um
Daniel says oh wait, i'm not sure how i'm supposed to read this exactly the actor says well
Yes, I do understand why the fans are unhappy
It speaks to a devotion that they care so much that they mind if someone messes with it
I understand people being critical of the films. He has remained fairly silent until now
While stars like mark hamill have dropped loaded comments online and in interviews
um
Daniel says I know it's been particularly difficult for him in relation to hamill lately because the new movies haven't given him much to do
I certainly recognize that and can relate to it in these new movies
I felt like a table decoration
That is difficult because I recognize this character c3po is with so much more
But I understand it is a whole film not a feature about c3po
That is just my personal disappointment. I get paid whether or not he does anything
It would be nice for him to have a purpose oh bad
And then there's links for all takes from people
Uh shitting on him basically in response, I think
Lots of people saying I hope he dies
Uh the the character I mean c3po
Oh, okay. Jesus. He got one saying when was c3po more than a talking prop c3po was a full-on character
Yeah
Well, he's not really in the sequel trilogy. Like i'm trying to remember he's just he just spouts off a random singular line
every like half a film
Um
Jeb nickels has responded saying excuse my two cents
But if old actors can't play ball about not being the main character, they should leave the ball and go home
Yeah, always a good thing to say jeb
Jeb
Run faster, dude. Yeah, it's slowing down
Can't wait for ben to kill that golden boomer. Wow
Fucking hell. Wow, what he said wasn't even controversial
like it was
Let's go back to ignoring the ot cast and shitty men y'all please bring peace back to my timeline
Okay
I bet that's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna freaking kill him too
They've killed every other original character at this point
Just fuck all the old things the new things are way better. You guys like the new stuff better, right?
Just to hell with that old shit. Someone's literally tweeted a gun pointed at old white men
Okay
All right, yeah that happened, uh, sorry c3po
Yeah
Feels bored man talk about let's look it comes from the crowd. It's like everyone's a loud opinion
apparently
But yeah that about brings us to the end, uh, this was the meme stream
Yeah

I don't know exactly what that means. We did it. Yay
Uh, the the stream from yesterday will be up on moolah very soon
