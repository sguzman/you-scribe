Not before.
Being alive sounds like something a racist would do.
I knew it.
Are you saying that we need more dead racists?
More dead racists.
Wouldn't we lose half the left wing at that point?
Damn it.
The left wing, we have the right.
Everyone knows they're all a bunch of racists.
Mm-hmm.
You look jab alone.
I think you lose a fair amount of a lot of ideologies.
It's ideologies idiot.
No, all the racists are specifically on the one side that isn't me.
That isn't me.
Look, this is me side.
This is me.
Side me.
Double whammy back-to-back efap.
Yes.
We have some memes to shleem.
What memes?
We have a big stream.
We're gonna go over all the memes.
We're gonna laugh.
We're gonna cry together as a family because that's what this meme stream is all about.
It's family.
It's about family and that's what's so powerful about it.
Mm-hmm.
Formalore.
Sure.
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, how's everyone doing?
You're all right?
Doing all right.
Doing doing pretty okey-dokes.
I mean, almost for my first drink.
We didn't we didn't really talk about how bad it is, but Spooktober is over.
Like, Spooktober is a shit Spooktober.
I moved to make this November a sequel to Spooktober.
It's no not November, which is kind of spooky.
The thing is, it'll start to bleed into, you know, Christmas-tober and we can't remember.
No, not Christmas.
Also means I am back home now.
Nude.
Which means you'll be streaming again.
That is true.
We got so much done while you were here.
We drank.
And watch movies.
Um, do we do we mention drinking already?
No, no, I think we should probably.
Oh, we had some drinks.
Yeah, and and and so many things so many things are all rearing to come out.
Batwoman episode 5 is coming out any any time now as in the actual episode.
We haven't seen it yet.
Yeah, obviously very excited about that.
I anticipated more than I anticipated episode 6 of Game of Thrones.
So season 8.
Oh my goodness.
Moira and Mel no longer sleeping in the same bad cry phase.
Yeah, we got us a meme stream with a meme cast, which means all the people here are basically like, they're so silly.
They're barely human.
Why watch your stream for peace?
I'm gonna stream tomorrow again.
I'm sorry.
I thought we would start this earlier.
Yeah, you could have streamed today.
What the fuck?
Idiot.
Yeah, you could have.
Why didn't you?
Because I thought I had an appointment at 8 o'clock.
With who?
Why would anyone who did this?
That's my answer.
It sounded a bit like peeing.
TLJ is in the critically acclaimed films category on Netflix.
Well, it was critically acclaimed.
My point was immediately gonna be, why does anyone care what Netflix thinks about a list called critically acclaimed films?
Like, that's just...
Netflix is making two seasons of another life.
See, Netflix can't be trusted.
They really can't.
Not after they canceled Daredevil.
Well, they canceled Daredevil.
They keep Batwoman and another life going.
That seems like, that seems right to me.
Obviously, it wouldn't be if we weren't in Clan World, but that's where we're at.
So, stop complaining, guys.
Geez.
Besides, we still have Batwoman.
That's what's important.
Yeah.
It's about Batwoman, and that's what makes it really special.
I'm a Batwoman.
Batwoman's great.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the show we needed.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the one we got.
Batwoman was sent down to punish us for our sins.
So, as a continuation from the previous stream, I have been made aware of the Reddit thread
regarding that Star Wars girl and Batwoman.
Which Star Wars girl?
That Star Wars girl.
That one.
So, we can have a gander at this.
It is titled,
This has to be the worst review I've ever seen.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
Is that what Anna looks like?
Is that her?
Yeah, that's Anna.
Oh, okay.
I just like the comment.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
So, why is this in the Batwoman subreddit?
Is it because she's reviewing Batwoman?
Yes.
So, to see her review is Batwoman review.
What the hell is CW thinking?
Which is a fair...
So, the defenders of Batwoman on the Batwoman subreddit.
They're upset that that...
What a strange thing to say.
They're upset that that Star Wars girl is negatively reviewing Batwoman.
Yes.
I'm sorry, you need to have a high understanding of literature to understand that.
But yeah, just to, you know, add to it.
She comes off as homophobic.
That's interesting.
Along with all that, she clearly didn't actually watch the show.
At most, she read a brief summary.
Oh, she's like Jenny Nicholson then.
Well, sorry.
I think that a brief summary of the episode.
That's what a show...
Each show is a brief summary stretched out into an episode.
Yeah.
They don't flesh things out.
Things just happen.
People really go out of their way to bring the show down.
You do not have to go out of your own way.
You just need to watch the episode if that was brought down.
Well, that's what going out of your way is.
If you watch it, it wasn't made for you.
So, you're going out of your way to watch something you know is terrible.
You're like, I watched the episode.
I didn't think it was good.
So, I was like, why would you go out of your own way?
Yeah.
Why would you go out of your own way as if that's even possible as a concept to go out of your own way?
I think kind of watching that woman counts as going out of your way.
Did you miss the past two minutes of conversation?
Quite possibly.
I wasn't focusing on it.
B ad rags been making jokes about that for ages that you just cut it.
I was looking through the thread.
I will admit, I was looking through the thread and reading what was on it.
And then thought, I'll enter back into the conversation now.
The jib inside your head has clearly fallen out of his wheel.
The jib in your head.
Your head jib is confused right now.
He's trying to file everything.
See, I'm curious about what she has to say.
So, I jumped around a spot.
She's really bitching about how Batman didn't save Kate's family.
I'm sorry.
That's so integral to the whole thing.
It's what everything is based on.
But yeah.
Did she tune out at the part where Batman thought he secured the car so he
could save the busload of children?
So, is that what he did?
Well, this is the thing when we were watching it.
That was the best faith interpretation I had.
But the contention for everyone is, wow, Batman fucked that up.
He fucked up like the what his grappling hook could hold.
That seems like Batman.
Just a real simple thing.
But then when that woman throws a batarang and it misses, that's the
batarang's fault.
That's the batarang's fault.
Exactly.
It wasn't calibrated for me.
God, this batarang wasn't calibrated for my short woman arms.
Therefore, that is why I missed.
It wasn't because I fucked up.
What are you calibrating a fucking batarang anyways?
With science.
Oh, thank you.
I know I could come to you.
So, you got jumped to another random part.
She's bitching about why they took Sophie for whatever reason.
She clearly tuned out of the part where Jacob sees her as a better daughter
and attempted to kill her because Alice knew it would piss off Jacob.
Fine.
So in later episodes, we know that she shouldn't have anything against
Jacob, though.
That's the thing.
Well, this, yeah, so this is the rest.
There's other problems you can generate from this for sure.
But like I will admit when you watch episode one, it does seem kind of
random that they go for a fuck.
What's her name?
Ex-girlfriend person.
Yeah.
The like like she remember the whole they just plaid the thing where
she's going to fucking fall off the thing and land on like a trampoline
that they capture.
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what and then you're like, oh, so it's very
important that Alice kill her because she's, you know, going against
like Jacob.
It's like, well, she fails miserably to kill her.
She doesn't really do a good job.
And she sort of let her go in the next three episodes.
Not really kind of not really.
I mean, like, you know who this person is.
You know where they live.
And again, just highlighting how awful of a villain Alice is like Alice
is aware that the stepmother has forged documents in order to convince
everybody that Alice was dead and she blames Batwoman and Jacob for
that.
Yeah, they blame the she blames more the people for believing the lie
instead of the person who lies.
And then she wants to kill Sophie.
She is a vengeful guy.
She sees her as a daughter like, wow, all right then.
Hey, listen, maybe there will come a time in the show where Jacob kind
of gives that impression once.
I think in the first episode, he's nice to her at some point.
There you go.
Yeah, he's sort of nice to her.
I guess.
That's like a daughter like Mahler.
I just I've always wanted to say Molly you you've just like always
been a daughter to me.
Oh, I've always sensed that the daughter father relationship we
have. I really can't understand why the show gets so much hate.
I didn't know that this is really bad.
All right, if these people if these people who complain and hate it
justify their opinion that it's bad just because it's bad.
Clearly, they haven't watched the other Arovis shows.
Oh, that's yeah, that's saying other things are also shit.
That's not saying your things good.
Does that statement obviously read as they say it's bad, which is
stupid because everything else is bad.
If anything, you're just saying things are consistently shit.
This is the exact same thing the TLJ defenders say.
Oh, yeah.
Well in the original trilogy.
Okay, even if that was true, that wouldn't I was going to make
your show.
The other CW shows may very well be bad.
Why would that mean the show isn't bad?
There's more shows than just the CW shows that get goes further.
Okay.
No, there are no if you like Batwoman your universe is watching
the CW shows and Batwoman is in no way worse than them.
It's like, okay.
You know what?
I believe that considering the clips of Superwoman.
I've yeah, well, I assume Arrow is best out of all of them.
It's either Arrow or Flash.
I remember you'll talk about that.
But I know that Superwoman is garbage.
I've heard Flash is the best.
I think yeah, we wouldn't know.
We don't want to know.
We are doing the unthinkable and judging something on its own
merits.
Look at this on the contrary at the moment.
The show is fresh and new and has a better atmosphere.
Sorry has better atmosphere and stories than Arrow for example.
Oh, no, Arrow.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no.
She's just it's a new by the way fresh and new just means,
you know, woohoo.
I've definitely never seen anything like Batwoman.
That is true.
Isn't the flash on Netflix right now?
I don't know.
Is this a different flash on the flash Batwoman?
Oh, look at this.
So clearly the show gets so much hate because it's about a lesbian
woman.
Yeah.
Where is that?
There's always one down.
But if someone actually watched the show, they will see that she
doesn't disrespect Batman.
Yes, he does.
Oh, man.
It was a first of all here right now.
He would fucking flabber.
But secondly, yes, he does.
Batman.
She doesn't disrespect Batman.
No, she doesn't disrespects.
Oh, no, I thought it was Spatman.
Spatman.
I'm the Spatman.
She doesn't want to take his place or claim she's better than
him.
She literally.
Oh, this came out before this came out before that was said.
Oh, my goodness.
That's why people like this show.
That's an age.
Well,
I'm not the same Batman.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better with Batman.
This show doesn't have any agenda.
Yeah, it just tells the story.
Sorry.
It just tell the story of a superhero who happens to be a gay
woman.
I don't think that's.
Man.
That's all that's all it is.
Is it just a comment that just says watch the fap biddies?
I was about to say that.
Yeah.
Like we've got a moment where she says I'm gonna be better
than Batman and then that comment is like she's not trying
to be better than Batman.
Okay.
I'm curious if on YouTube or someplace we could get our
hands on somebody like live reviewing our minis or something
or doing a response to our minis.
Oh, do you mean like someone who disagrees with us?
Like people who disagree with our our mini our reactions to
it as we watch the show.
Now you've said that you might encourage people to do it
in like a fake way.
Let's hope that we don't be able to tell we can sniff this
sort of thing through.
Yeah, we usually vet a little bit before we just throw on
a video.
So oh, yeah, we'll be fine.
By the way, anybody who hasn't seen the Jay Longbone reviews
of the they're great.
Please do make an effort to watch them.
They're great.
Yeah, you shouldn't just watch one person's review of these
film video things because they're so terrible.
Like one person is not going to catch everything that's wrong
with them.
And I mean that I'm serious.
Like there are things that Jay Longbone says and Thorius
Unlimited say that we just don't catch we legitimately just
missed it because there's so much.
The reviews are awful and generally politically motivated.
Ours really aren't we?
I'm part of yes.
I'm part of the good show party.
Yes, we advocate for consistency in the in the eFap party.
Yeah, we refuse were politically motivated.
Wouldn't they say it was good like mainstream reviewers
politically motivated.
That's the kind of thing that they like.
Well, they were they're addressing people like Anna and
they assume Anna hates lesbians.
I guess politically something.
I don't really know.
It's not as opposed to morally.
I have a political hatred of lesbians.
It's not like stop having rights.
It's political.
I hate the lesbian party.
So I saw a bit of one of the one you show here.
She complains that things that could have been dragged out
for a whole season are resolved in first two episodes.
Some of her words repeating this idea were don't drop every
single bomb in the first episode.
You could really drag this out.
You could have dragged this out for a whole season.
Like that's a problem that the show gets to the point too
much.
What you're looking for is rush.
Yeah, the show gets to the point too much.
That's what they conclude for me say that it's almost too
well for all of a sudden we have we need to have our we
need to respect the time.
Listen, the time of the people who enjoy Batwoman.
It's very valuable.
They're doing it.
They're doing very important things.
Otherwise, all right.
I like that.
I get your point, but I think that this drama about Kate and
her family.
Most people are just confused because they haven't had a lot
of time to care yet.
Like if Darth Vader told Luke is his father 30 minutes into
a new hope it wouldn't work as well.
Yeah, it wouldn't.
That's one of our memers.
Yeah, it's just like by the way, have you ever considered
that's why that wasn't done?
Like yes, you're going to care about people.
The whole story should be five minutes.
It would get to the point better.
It would don't post these idiots and give them extra publicity
of views.
Don't challenge my thoughts as if any of these people actually
watched it.
Like any of these people actually want to watch the review.
No, it's the top the top things on the thread say I skipped
around after half.
I only skipped the two random parts like great.
Yeah, go away.
Genuine guess 60% didn't watch it.
30% watch portions 10% if we're lucky watch the video.
I think there's probably yeah, I'm being really generous.
I don't think the show is good yet, but I have watched each
episode to criticize it without completely watching the episodes
is not fair.
You can criticize episodes.
Yeah, individual episodes can absolutely be criticized and
I would be curious to the if this person could let us know
beforehand how many episodes we need to watch before we're
able to reach a conclusion just so we know when we get there.
So it's not a constant moving the goal post of oh, no, you
have to watch more.
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
If you have to watch more really not to mention it's all
like our later episodes really going to fix what happened to
the previous ones.
Like are the effects just suddenly not bad anymore in like
the previous episodes and so on.
Yeah, because it's revealed.
It was all faked by mysterious say, for example, we were
tasked with writing the rest of it.
There are fixes we could try and apply.
We could try but but you know, there's something you could
do to try and make it better.
But let's say for example, I was tasked with writing the
remaining 14 episodes.
I'd be like the season still gonna be bad overall.
There's no way I'm gonna be able to do anything about that.
It's hard to come back from some of this stuff.
What's happened happened.
We can do our best to flesh out relationships and back story.
Obviously, I'm discounting the idea of having to wake up and
go.
Whoa.
What are the crazy long dream?
Okay.
Yeah, I dreamt.
I was bad girl.
Well back to school and back to school.
Why do you give them all publicity?
You do realize that you're basically encouraging more people
to watch her video and give and given she probably makes money
from ads based on the view of using a video and the response
for the poster is I never told anyone to watch it.
Jesus Christ.
How dense can it be?
Apparently there's a crossover already between that one
and Arrow.
Yeah, there's like and what is it the the extroverse or?
The extroverts the extrovert.
The extrovert extroverts unite.
People who have no knowledge in literature have no place to
make a review reviews are supposed to be unbiased given
with knowledge.
Wow.
This is neither knowledgeable nor read like me.
I don't mind watching a review that is biased, especially if
that's the fucking point like if they're like, we're going
to be looking at this from the perspective of but if you
like, you know, this is what it is and you're clearly biased.
That's a problem.
But the idea that you can't have any bias kind of weird.
That's that's like the full opposite of Quentin's take of
like a review is just a description of an experience and
it's wrong for like the exact well, no the same reason.
It's like it can be this video is like going to the doctor
who's never been to med school.
What it's not how this works.
No, that's not that's not not a very good analogy.
A doctor who's never been to med school can still accurately
diagnose and cure you.
Yeah, you can still be an amazing doctor.
It's about level of trust and accountability.
It's not about this.
It's not about ensuring right?
Not to mention it's like it makes it sound like she's trying
to say.
Oh this person didn't spend seven years in school to learn
how to watch movies to learn how to criticize Batwoman.
I definitely did.
There's a comment that says what about people that did watch
it and didn't like it and then you got the responses that
if they can leave a valid response as to why then, you
know, that's fair enough or whatever and so we'll just respond
it with what we're reacting to Batwoman season.
What episode?
Why do you fat bit it?
There you go.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
Like the they really don't like people shitting on the show.
It makes sense.
They're a community of Batwoman.
I can't believe a community formed around that show.
That's saying that's a real thing.
I imagine it's a community that's like already just like
bleeding over from the other shows.
Maybe yeah, I like because my conclusion on a lot of this
is just like, you know, you know, like TLJ you can get a
lot of like rationalization and I'm just like so how bad
does the show have to be before it has zero fans and I
don't think it's just not possible, right?
There's always going to be someone who likes something.
Yeah, that's where we're at.
Well, that was fun.
That was great.
I agree with everything that was said.
That stars goes in chat as well.
Yeah, we found the thread.
That was a very fun read.
Keep this off.
Go for it.
It's funny.
Remember if they post about you, you're you're essentially
Um, so next up we've got the well, I was going to give you
guys a link to this, but there's no point because obviously
I'm doing it on screen, but you can play along.
I suppose make your own tears as we're doing it, but this
is supposed to be a tier list of efap villains.
Unfortunately, Jeb Nichols is not in here.
So I don't know if we can like quickly make one or something,
but we can head Canada.
Yeah, I don't actually recognize all of these icons.
I might do after we just discuss them for a little bit,
but I'm almost feeling like is this it?
Is this all the people we've covered because we need to improve
like, you know, it can't be all the people that have been
covered on efap.
I guess it's just the prominent ones.
I don't know.
Mem- most memorable.
Yeah, Jay's in there as well.
Jay or defap villain, how's that feel?
Beautiful.
So this first tier list, well, I was going to say we'll do
two and one will be tearing them for the meme ability and
the other one will be tearing them for like quality in terms
of a content creator.
And I suppose the rule will have to be overall versus the
video we covered because that's not going to apply very
easily with a lot of these people if we've covered more
than one video and also if we've watched them separately.
So and you know, we can have a look at chat, see what they
think as well.
But which one would you guys want to do first, I guess?
Well, memes, I think.
So hold on a minute.
This is this it ranks them to who's the most evil to who's
the least evil.
I suppose.
Well, so the two, do you hear anything?
I see Ally up there and now I'm confused.
Oh, ignore those.
I'm going to change them to S plus and then god-like.
I already know who's going in god-like.
Yeah, me too.
Alright, one day.
Yeah.
So it's just like I said, degree of either quality of meme
ability, which one do you want to do first?
Memes wallet.
Let's do.
Yeah, we can start off with meme ability.
Get us in the main mood.
So we'll use kind of say low tier meme ability.
Yeah, somewhere in the middle ish middle low.
He's reasonably meme-able.
I'd say C.
What really it's like we know because D is the worst right
the absolute worst, but we did get the whole I fucking hate
Trump thing out of them.
And ragged.
Oh, that was him.
Yeah, and also that's just fan stuff narrative tripling.
Was that same video?
I think he's in a at least I thought narrative tripling was
so sorry narrative tripling goes to TRO rather than him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think I think I think B.
I see your B with B was okay.
Well, I almost feel like let now the the overton window, right?
I if they were in grade school because there's not an F.
So we have to boost that up or D is the lowest we can shoot.
Maybe we can come back to him later after we after we filter in
some of the end of the list.
All right.
So I would if I'm making a vote now, I would say he's B.
So while we haven't had many memes out of him, the ones that
we do have are pretty powerful stuff and long-lasting.
I don't know.
I feel like a lot of the memes we get from him.
We don't reference all that much.
Maybe the Trump one is the most popular rags is one of the
most way.
He wasn't necessarily him, right?
That's a combo.
That's a lot of people a lot of people don't know how to
pluralize things that end in S apparently.
He shares that with TRO or it might actually go strictly
the TRO.
I'm not 100% sure on that.
But we'll like I said, we'll put it at the end of the list
and we'll figure it out as we go along.
So Patrick Willems, I'm going to drop that to begin with and
then we'll figure it out.
So Patrick Willems.
We've got I say I would say that Patrick Williams.
Well, let's see.
He is a meme.
Our space wizard meant for children thing.
I was going to say there's not a lot of memes associated with
him, is there?
Yeah, watching a lot of dumb stuff.
It's a meme himself though.
Those aren't like memes per se, not in the sense like they're
just dumb stuff.
He said it's different than memes.
I would I would argue.
I do agree that he is essentially a meme.
I do agree with that.
But what does that mean for the monster?
It's my favorite.
Yeah, but he's not a meme because he says meanie things
so much as he says stupid shit.
Yeah, that's what makes him a meme.
I don't think that like all I don't think memes are the
same quite the same like he is a he is a meme.
We say that as a meme, but he hasn't really said a lot of
stuff that I think is meanie.
But all of our all the people in the audience use second
language is English.
I'm so sorry.
You're watching movies wrong.
Yeah, that was quite a thing.
I would I was it's intended for children.
That was him original fine with B.
I'm fine with B for Patrick Willems.
I'm okay.
He was chat.
What's your favorite Patrick Willems quote?
It's going to be hardly any means.
I swear to chat.
It's your job whenever we come up with one of these to
start throwing memes at us.
We remember them.
Okay, that's that your interaction.
You'll you'll remind us you need your help so you can
throw in any note.
What are you okay?
He said that space titty aliens were his favorite addition
to Star Wars.
Say that I still think B though, I don't matter.
He's he's up against a lot of competition here.
So I think there's I think we're going to have a lot of
B AB and C tier guys.
I'm happy to leave him in B for now.
Yeah, I think B is 1.2.
Bill, you know, no, he's there.
We'll get to you.
We'll get there.
Yeah, so this is the man who made the the only one we
covered was him saying that a Infinity War equates love
with abuse.
I would honestly put him he's possibly our D like I don't
think we even mean.
Yeah, I think he's D.
We didn't get any memes from that.
I don't know.
He wrote alien colonial Marines.
Oh, he did.
Oh, how does that factor in?
Yeah, I think that puts him up to a C.
I think that that's like, you know, one mention that boost
him a little is what you might say D would just be there
are no memes based on them.
And then C is like, you know, maybe if we can have something
Is there anybody who hasn't had a meme about them?
Well, we've managed a few years.
No, no, because he said he can't you have to remember seven
people's names.
Oh, yeah, cinema wins.
This is it will wait.
Hang on.
We'll get there.
All right.
We'll leave is everyone.
Okay with C for film.
I'm C for film joy.
If anything, the fact that he wrote aliens colonial Maria,
that's quite a bit out of the bottom list, even if it's only
well, I think it should count because we did efap that game
on efap gaming.
So videos from that game.
Oh, man.
So Jay is next.
Jay, I'd say Jay is ally or S.
We got no, so I've changed it to me and we've got no ally
category.
What?
Oh, we don't know how I changed it to SS plus Godlike.
Well, there's no reason not to farm rhinos.
This is so I need to rename.
Oh, as a as I will change that to S plus.
All right, do that.
If you read it upwards, it says ass Godlike.
Nice or Godlike.
Yes.
Saba, just good.
I'm happy with honestly, my first guess would be as plus.
I think we're looking at a pretty strong name material here.
Some of the some of the strongest memes have been generated
from this creature.
Yeah, that I genuinely feel like this is an achievement.
So we have mom, he he we got good memes from him
that when we first covered him and he continues to be
a source of me amusement.
So I would say I would say he's up there.
S plus or S one of those two S plus probably I would say
that we sell the future.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
There's a lot of shit.
There's a lot Mel.
What's your take S or S plus?
Uh, actually somewhere in between actually.
Well, if we got to wait, what was yours Rex?
S plus.
So you've got two S plus is the between S plus and S
and then S that does average amount to S plus.
Yeah.
Next up, Matt job.
His whole life is kind of a meme.
His whole career is a meme.
Yeah, polder boy.
Yeah, he's he's maybe taken that step from meme hood
into case study.
I was going to say for me.
It's probably S maybe a he's he's not just an eFAT meme
though. He's like a Monday.
You met you meet.
You said Monday.
I was confused.
I like how people people in chat would have scored him low.
It's like no guys.
I kind of want to score him low too.
Well, we got we got lots of fun out of him in his video
about Game of Thrones.
Remember?
Yeah, man.
People are all over the place about Matt Gebro.
I I think because it's every it's really all over the place.
I'm fine with I'll put him at a for Matt.
I do want to clarify.
Is this just how many eFAT memes there are like how memeable
they are just like for the world?
Because he's got like he's memed a lot outside of eFAT.
Yeah, that's true.
I would say in general.
Well, let's just let's just compare the right.
So if it was eFAT only he probably scores like a B, right?
Yeah, probably.
I don't think he said that.
But if we can't if we count them as a whole which I did say
we kind of have to do sort of because the problem is that then
he wouldn't be any fat fella.
This is very skewed if we don't count them with other stuff
because we're fully a lot of these people have a lot of
backstory we're aware of.
I don't think he's as high as Patrick.
And when eFAT runs we are talking about these people with
knowledge of their backstory.
It's not like eFAT ignores mundane Matt's history.
We made bolder jokes all the time.
That is that is true.
So A around around an A.
Yeah, I think he's more meme-y than Patrick Willems.
So this is an interesting one.
Cinema sins.
I don't actually know.
Probably a D.
I don't know any memes about cinema sins to be honest.
But we haven't really had any memes out of him.
So I'd say just D plus he's not I don't know if he tries to
be meme-y or if he's just chat.
Are there any good cinema sins eFAT memes as cinema since ever
been memed on eFAT not that I can recall.
I have no memory.
Yeah.
It's going D D D F D D F D D D F because I think a lot of
people that we cover talk about cinema sins, but we'd never
really talk about cinema sins.
Give him to D.
I'm not seeing a single meme yet like oh the plank.
That was funny.
The plank was good, but I don't think it was a random plank
in the forest.
At least this is a pirate plank.
That was that was funny.
Yeah, he's still D.
He doesn't get it.
He doesn't get it was the it was the blade from the helicopter.
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, I'm happy to put it as our bottom of the list though.
Yeah, next up.
I think someone who comes close to very few memes, maybe
CTA the right opinion.
Are there any well?
No idea.
He gets credited with rags doesn't he?
I think we give him rags because it was his editing team
that did it, but it still belongs to him.
narrative tripling.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I have to pick it up.
No, I would I'd agree.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I would say yeah, cuz he's he's not like Mimi.
He's just sad.
I I I wouldn't he doesn't like.
I don't yeah, I put a C at the highest.
All right.
I think see the suitable place Joseph Anderson.
So let's see.
My review has been viewed by more people than anyone.
That's a very disgusting horror game subjectivity is implied.
So it was not a horror.
Yeah, yeah.
That was spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky.
Undertale.
So we're A ish.
A to S is probably going to be isn't this probably.
Yeah, he's I'd say a yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I like a say he's a.
Looks like Chad is straddling between A and S.
Okay.
Oh dude, massive came out of him.
Oh, that's right.
Oh shit.
He's S now that boobs him up to S.
Yeah, congratulations.
Joseph.
Good job.
You're more Mimi than Matt Jarbo.
You did it.
You did it.
You win the internet.
I like the phrase that as massive came out of him.
All right.
Cosmonal variety hour.
Do we have anything on that guy?
I was going to say we might be looking at a B or C here because I can't
remember.
You can't remember you.
You don't get to be if you can't even remember.
Yeah.
I'd say he's a cinema since got the plank.
That was it.
Yeah, but what's what do we have of Cosmo stupid shit?
But I don't think any of us we did actually kind of like his joke about
the whole close shut this damn door and he bleeped it.
Remember that?
That was kind of funny.
I don't know if that counts as a meme though.
I'd say that's still D.
Do any memes chat?
Do any memes come from me?
I'm saying the prize.
No memes have come from him.
Yeah, I'm saying D.
Also, I'm sure a year to six months right.
That's just right.
Well, when we're in here for whatever of you just try isn't in
this list.
No.
Is there a way to add people to the list as you're on it?
Save download reset reset create template.
I'm guessing you have to like upload the pictures individually.
Damn just right.
We can we can do an honorary thing with just right.
We'll probably do him next.
I know we can't put him in but we decide where you go so screenshot
the tail is I'm not seeing like any memes about Cosmo.
Is he a D then?
He's a do you think is a D?
Yeah, all right.
Cause he's he says some yeah, just right.
Probably be an S rank.
If we had him here, I imagine he's point big.
Do you think he would be S huh?
Yeah, he probably would actually.
Yeah.
He did be giddiest didn't he?
A lot of great shits come out of just right.
Yeah, a lot of shits come out of just right.
Did I hit everything on you?
We have we haven't covered and I hit everything video on eFap
yet.
Yeah, only Rags did.
We will get it eventually.
He pops up every once in a while because of it, but we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, and as much as we could use never bored, it's we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, we probably S rank just right.
If we had him next up shinobi.
We're looking at like a probably a C again.
I don't know.
No memes that came the stage from him, right?
Yeah, he was like he has a Mimi personality, but no real
memes came from him that we say as far as I know D.
Let me see.
Oh, I guess D would be more accurate.
Yeah.
D is pretty accurate.
I know he blew his channel up after the cover, you know, there
was yelling into the mic and piercing your ears and saying
the blank and then responds.
He talks it through did not come from shinobi.
So when it really I thought it did.
No toxic road came from I think was AJ the OP soon.
Yeah, that was well, I fucked up the thing.
So no, but
yeah, so yeah, I guess he's a D someone.
Someone is saying that shinobi is the origin of the episode
nine question.
Oh, that might bump him up.
Well, would it bump him up to C?
I mean C is an interesting collection.
We've got the guy made no memes, but he created well,
he wrote alien corner is the guy was kind of man, but there
was some things almost like where you go if you just don't
belong in D and we don't know where to put you.
It's like a purgatory here at this point.
I'm okay with putting him at C because of that.
That's kind of what it looks like.
It's what the tier is becoming.
C is like a not meme-y but technically not meme-less either.
Yeah.
He's got at least some power level.
Yeah, it's C is kind of almost normie tier and D is just
boring people.
Eric slash Patricia Taksim.
That's up pretty high.
I'm trying to think of specific memes that came from her.
Yeah, I don't know about.
Yeah, that's a good point specific memes.
I'm not certain just an extremely strange.
I would say vindictive intelligent person extremely could
be C.
What is chat saying?
I think really name a good meme that came out of
Patricia Taksim.
That's a thing.
I can't.
That's why I'm thinking it's C.
I think it's C.
Oh, little centrist boy.
Little centrist boy.
Yeah.
When do we use it?
It was a monumentally ugly.
It was titatically ugly.
We use it during a gig Cadell episode.
Well, oh, yeah, the centrist boy.
Yeah, it's a little centrist boy.
Yeah, that would play C, right?
Because I think that's still C.
Yeah.
For centrism.
All right.
I guess that's a C.
Damn.
Cinema wins.
Cinema wins.
Remind me what we covered from.
Oh, the TLJ one.
Yeah, the TLJ one.
Were there any memes from that?
Were there any memes from that?
I don't know, man.
I feel like we've got nothing for cinema wins.
I can't remember.
Yeah, I think that might be a D.
Just bad video, not meme.
I'm looking at, yeah, we got loads of D's in chat.
The D's are flying through.
Yep.
Yeah, boy.
I don't agree.
So many D's.
Where is F?
What's something like Ocean Man?
Oh, did Ocean Man?
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because cinema wins went on about people's themes and that's
where that came from.
But I don't think it's, I don't think it was his like, like
while he led to it.
I don't think you can really credit the meme to it.
Oh, and Kyle Ben came out of that too, in a way.
But it wasn't, I don't think it was anything you should credit
to him.
Surely we have to credit them when memes are created.
Like, for example, all the Jeb memes are now accredited to
Jeb Nichols.
Sure, at least.
Yeah.
That puts him in a C, right?
I would, yeah, C. C's fit in with the rest of the memes.
Even more of a C minus, but there is no C minus.
Okay, which takes us to Sarah Z.
Someone said Kyle, someone's Kyle Ben came from Drunk Rags.
I mean, it was definitely the logic of Kyle Ben.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you accidentally, you said, I said, you either said
Kylo Ben or Kylo or Kyle Ren and then we doubled it up because
we thought it was, yeah, because it was a whole like play
Kyle's theme and stuff like that.
Yeah, so there's the fly meme which puts her at least at a
C. I think that's it though, isn't it?
There was the meme about her being the sister of Jared.
I don't know if that had my staying power, probably not.
I don't remember it.
Oh, we, someone saying the burned door that linked to Jared's
room.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
I think that's it though, which kind of places her C.
C. Jack Saint.
I'm thinking we're just gonna need to put him next to Patty
Tax and be done.
Not very, not very meme-able, is he?
No, he's not.
He's kind of a boorish idiot.
Yeah, there's not really a lot that's there to meme.
I'm trying to think of anything.
That was seed seers getting stacked.
Not a lot of fun comes out of that, dude.
Just not a lot of fun at all.
We could be in a D sort of thing for that, actually.
Yeah, I would say, yeah, I'd say he certainly loves me.
If he's got long man bat comes from him.
Oh my god, yeah.
Oh, that's one of the strongest memes we have.
Long man bat is one of the greatest memes.
But we, but I think, did we come up with that because of
him or is he the one who counted?
Oh, he definitely didn't say long man bad, but we came up
with it because of his video.
I'm thinking that he didn't say long critique is not deep
critique is what he had said.
I'm fine with a at least at their bare minimum and a for
that really.
I would go that far.
I would say that we do long the long man think of all the
memes that became of long man.
All the one meme.
It is a powerful.
Yeah, still this means that it's not just quantity.
It is quality.
I guess why do you have to answer?
Yeah, well, we were able to name like four or five things
from Jojo.
You know, what's crazy is I am that Robbie is coming up
soon and didn't the dawn come from his video or was that?
It was one of the people we covered for Captain Marvel.
Wasn't that brown table?
Oh, the whole straw man doing whichever one had Jack as
well.
Robot head is gassed.
Which one was that robot head?
Oh, yeah, Jack is responsible for like a lot of the straw
man memes.
Well, it's between A and B.
I think at this point.
I'm fine with B.
Oh, I will accept to be it's once it's one strong meme
that gets him up to be but it's like I don't I wouldn't
say to write that but that was legal out of her.
No, no, it must have been I'm I'm that Robbie because it
was robot head started it.
He started the meme and it was I'm that Robbie is the one
that he guessed it on.
So yeah, but we've got yeah, I'm fine with B.
It doesn't put it puts above the quagmire of C.
We got straw man and long man bad coming out of him, which
is strong but with do we definitely concluding that he's
lower than Matt, Matt, Matt job over then.
Yeah, he's lower than that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Game makers toolkit.
Hi.
Oh, that's gonna be I know how meme-able he is for that
too.
Yeah.
Yeah, because that's the thing.
It's just like everything he says.
Yeah, like there's so much out of his mouth.
When it comes to if have so much inspiration come from
this guy.
I mean, it is already down the bottom.
Yeah.
Goodell is entirely like supposed to be afraid does his
show.
Yeah, it's a tile for press the
forms.
The aim for
the double jump.
He's so fantastic.
Is he Jay jump?
No, not quite.
He's got a lot of good means, but he doesn't.
He's not rhino milk.
Dark Souls.
Dark Souls.
He's Dark Souls.
Some people are asking us about like Dark Souls.
No, he's not.
We know who that's reserved for.
We know who God like is.
One slot for God like I think.
I don't know.
So you guys plus you guys deciding s plus I'm going with
s plus two.
What's the three remaining votes?
I agree.
Yeah, s plus is good.
I would say s but I'm happy with s plus.
You just don't want to
You don't want to
Come on Jay share.
Don't be dad guy.
Ren's reviews or Ren reviews.
I can't see not too familiar with the guy.
There was a couple memes.
There's a couple
Let me other than the meme list, but he's not got any proper
memes.
He's like it's a B or C.
I think really so what would you say what would lift him out
of C?
Yeah, what pushes him up to a B actually?
Yeah.
Okay.
I changed my vote just to see he was a familiar faces guy
right multiple faces.
Yeah, remember like what multiple faces.
He gave us a live example of somebody like refusing to accept
information moving the goal post like seven times in a row.
That is true with the mask creator.
Yeah, I was crazy.
That was in that was really interesting.
That was the having him watch that specifically after we
pulled up the clip and showed it to him.
It's it's like a man losing his religion.
It was very odd.
He created Southpaw.
Hmm does that lift him out of C?
It's not D, but it's not A.
So it's.
Yeah, I don't know about the loaded A right now.
He's gonna be alone where free goes.
She's in good company, but I doubt I doubt anything would really
take him out of C.
Yeah, someone's saying bringing forth Southpaw meme.
I agree.
That's fair.
Let's go to multiple places me first.
I'm watching one of these for wake Robin in the chat.
We're ranking the meme ability of all the the e fat villains.
So why didn't you say you more you can't change team when
it's convenient that mean change team change team first off.
Don't take it too seriously.
Yeah, I'm ranking the meme ability of e fat villains.
Well, you mean you're you're not taking this seriously.
So yeah, very seriously.
This is like the most important thing.
I've done all I'd say C.
I think C.
Yeah, he Stacey.
Okay.
So next up according to me is God like yeah, God like if you
disagree, you're wrong.
God like you're wrong.
You're objectively wrong.
God like damn.
He's that fantastic.
I'm just curious.
What's happening is there any disagreements if any if anyone
disagrees kill them.
I'm so I was gonna say that kill came out.
God like God like God like God like 1.2 we create 1.2.
There's no point in referencing all the memes that come out
of him.
There's too many.
There's too many.
We'll have a whole episode.
Total tier.
Total tier.
There's a whole tier.
A plus to T.
I'm putting down agreement.
Leave God like empty.
What he wasn't putting down agreements.
That was me.
No, I know but I say get a chat.
Yeah, there you go.
Leave God like empty and have Tonal be ascended above it.
Yeah, we've got like a total tier above God like T rank.
And then next we have toxic group T or Captain.
I can't even fucking see it because of the background color.
Okay.
Are you actually adding another one?
Yeah, it says it's wrong.
Ronald Donald total add to dictionary totaled.
Yes, how do you the heavenly color?
I'll add row above.
Okay.
Here it is.
I see it.
There.
So you change God likes a black now put it back.
I have to check this to be sure but I'm pretty sure AJ is the
guy we covered with world-class bullshits and geeks and gamers.
He's the one who did the toxic brood.
The thing about how you'd follow a waitress into an alleyway
with a knife.
If she don't know what the fuck that was anymore.
I'm trying to remember it.
What are we looking at?
Yeah, at least s it definitely sounds very sane.
Yeah, toxic brood ends in a lot of points.
What do you think chat?
What other memes came from that video?
I can't even remember.
He named the community Medea was born in that episode.
I don't know if it was his fault in any way though.
Medea was born.
John Adam spider.
Oh shit.
That was that episode.
Oh, see the one looks like you're allowed to like he was
all.
Yeah, you're allowed to like this plus s plus really.
I'm okay with now.
No, no, I don't know.
I don't think he's s look at s plus these are lame generators.
He's not like he's made some strong memes.
That's for sure.
He must have the highest memes per minute generation.
Well, his video was long.
Yeah, but still it's not like well game makers toolkit
generates me.
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
And tonals meme generation is off the charts quite literally.
We had to we had to extend the chart to include him.
I'm saying s yeah, I'm cool with s.
Yeah, s is good.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
We got the high tiers getting some good company now.
I am that Robbie who is responsible for the dawn a ha ha a
for the dawn.
Really?
I don't know man.
That's that's another super strong.
It's another super strong, but it's one so far.
We need to wait.
Wasn't he the top-voted man by the community?
He was yeah, I think we need to see if that's still the case
because there are new memes now.
There are more relevant me.
Yeah, but the fact that it won that poll anyway is yeah,
I mean it and I would say that does he get credit for that?
I can I can support him being an S if it's created.
I think that's our rules.
Anyway.
All right.
Yeah, that's fine.
I can support him being an S because it keeps my job.
Oh, I think it matches s got the creation of the toxic brood
in there as well.
Yo, somebody just sent hang on somebody just sent me a list
of updated memes.
There's a whole lot more names in here.
Do we want to go to this one?
Oh, give me the is the same as this.
If you give me the link, I'll just slot everybody.
We've done already.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, we're almost done.
Wait, no, no, I'm in this shit.
Here it is.
All right.
Thank you to kibakins.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, yes.
I do wonder what this like tier list would look like if it
was entirely community vote based.
Yeah, there's so many more now.
All I do is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
Oh, there we go.
And I'm just going to put this over here a second while I
slot everybody in.
Oh my god, that's a lot.
So Sarah Z was nuts.
See we didn't do.
Wynton.
Yeah.
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Jay.
Yeah, shut up.
Tornald.
It's tornald.
We're missing from.
Oh, he's down there.
AJ.
Yeah, Mr.
Anderson.
Oh, where's Monday Matt?
Matt was A.
No, I mean, where is he in the pictures?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, three, three fuck theater.
That's him, right?
He's three, but theater is him.
Then we need Willems and Jack St.
And oh, I got a whole bunch through here.
Film joy.
TRO, where are you?
Oh, is TRO not in here?
Oops.
Did we lose TRO?
Yeah, but I mean, you know,
he was in the sea.
So I guess it's not too bad.
The sea is the tier where he is there.
He's already in sea.
Oh, I'm retarded.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm retarded too, then.
All right.
Tax on.
There we go.
Cinema wins.
Doo doo and D was cinema sins.
And there we are.
All right.
I have successfully transferred old man more.
All right.
So next up is Quentin Reviews.
It's got to be a high score.
Who's that right next to him?
He kind of looks like Quentin Reviews.
Oh, it's the guy we covered in the small video.
The director of Shazam.
We watched his five-minute video.
Well, he can put him and D right away, then.
Yeah, that's D.
Throw him in there real quick.
Yeah, Quentin is probably eight here.
At least.
That was a pretty strong.
That fucking eight-drop thing was pretty strong.
I don't think he's-
He's just a little straw manning.
Does that really put him above long man bad, though?
And Teddy Milk is my favorite addition to Star Wars.
Hmm.
You make a point.
See what chat has to say.
Quentin's either A or S.
A review is just the description of your experiences.
Yeah, he has a lot of-
Characters plot, lore, consistency.
It's just fan stuff.
I fucking hate Trump.
Rags doesn't like-
Rags thinks a movie is objectively bad if it sells toys.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Oh, and it's his opinions.
Well, they are subject or they are objective.
What I'll say is there are a couple of these memes,
but a lot of them, some people might not even remember
some of these.
They're a bit.
Some people might not even remember what a Y-Wing is.
I would say he's already getting up there between.
Everybody always asks Y-Wing.
They never ask how Wing.
Do you want better?
Y-Wing.
Got it.
That went well.
I'm just gonna go kill myself now.
I'm okay with A.
What's everyone feeling?
It's A and S in the chat.
What?
Well, I'm asking you guys.
This is-
Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay, I'd say A.
Rags.
It literally isn't showing your icon.
So I'm like, oh my god.
It worked.
My icon is gone for you.
It's gone.
That's a screenshot of it.
It's just not there.
Oh man.
Well, rip me in your.
It's actually weird not having your icon.
It's like you're talking to me from some other place.
Just the fact that your icon isn't there.
All right.
Well, actually, where are you?
So pop culture detective who we have not covered since I think
episode, I want to say three could be two.
Classic.
I think it's three.
One who had the hilarious take on TLJ, but I'm not sure what
memes have survived from that.
Yeah, I'm trying to think right now.
He might just be be.
I mean, I'm trying to think of what was his theme reaching
idiot.
I don't think anything that I know of.
I don't know who this is.
This next one.
Neither do I.
No idea.
Help us out.
Who's this guy?
Who is that?
Could be just like so one of the random videos we've covered
before.
Probably is.
D rank.
Oh, obviously, these are all from efap.me.
Oh, yeah.
Which means I can just go there and look at the list and find
him.
Somebody said he did the core of it with er.
Oh, did he was that him?
If I wasn't the core of it just right.
I feel like I don't know because then that were big ideas
came from.
Yeah, he did.
Why core is better than aang avatar than aang yet.
So so that was not just right.
No, well, he did a core video too.
Oh, got it.
Yeah, that guy we've he's got to be D.
There's nothing I remember about that.
I don't even better remember covering the video, but we
yeah, we watched it with you.
Put him in C.
Just for nostalgia.
No, you don't get C for nostalgia.
No.
All right.
Major Lee.
Major Lee S plus.
It's a possible S plus.
He's a slice.
He's really up there.
So we got a slice and dice.
Look at women.
Look at women.
Just just those two on their own.
I think puts them in at least desk.
This is certainly a pretty wrong one.
And he is just a meme on his own as well.
Like he is.
Well, does he lose any does he lose points for being like
like his motivations being kind of?
Oh, you mean like a funny man.
Yeah, like just trying to be provocative for its own sake.
That's good.
Losing points that I think they came out of S plus.
Yeah, I would because I think that the the the integrity
if that's the way to call it the the the honesty of their.
You know, the way they carry themselves as part of it, like
he seems very disingenuous.
I'd agree with that.
Yeah.
So but not in the way the others are.
But what I will say is we don't know for sure because I'm happy
to actually believe that he's well, he says that's what he said,
isn't he?
Yeah, but that's what I mean.
That's what I mean, like so he says a lot of stupid shit
and it's like, are you fucking seriously listening?
He's like, no, I'm going to evoke you.
Who said touched fingers?
Was that guy?
Yeah, that was him.
Yeah.
So what I'm going on that is that like I think that he partially
said that as a sort of cover for how stupid a lot of the stuff
that he says is that might drop him to S because of what
reg said about how he.
Yeah, I agree.
I think he's in that way.
Yeah.
And also the I mean the whole debate was just a nightmare nightmare.
So there is the next is that a wing.
What is that?
It's a sleek legal.
I think is that legal legal legal legal legal legal.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
And then he was the one saying like you touch the map and that's
battery.
It's at least he's not he's above sea.
So is that where Dawn's from?
No, no, no.
Bolstered I think I think he bolstered the dawn for sure to be
like, you know, he's on really flourished.
He's a charitable guy and then he and then she fucked him up.
Yeah, I think since we're doing all of them, the official meme
rating needs to appear on efap.me next to the profile.
The rating for the total.
This is total.
I'm liking me so far for the guy unless we can come up with any
more that he had or we got two memes.
They didn't go long, but they're good ones.
He meant us more angry though.
Like he legit like made me angry.
Yeah.
Yeah, he it was just kind of disgusting the video like and
kind of threatening him pretty much above sea at that point.
He came after the dawn like they're you do that.
You do get docked points for that.
Yeah, yeah.
He's another one of those ones where he is himself.
Oops, I've heard him reference so many times as a joke.
He battered her.
Is are we thinking like she's bad.
It's a BOC.
Sorry by that logic.
She she battered Stanley.
So is everyone happy with me?
Yeah.
All right, Jim Sterling privilege goggles.
That is all privilege goggles and privilege goggles doesn't
get referenced that much which puts them is that C.
I think it would be C plus, but I think yeah, see it could
be a B.
So I see competition is a little tough.
We've got some echo C to be honest.
See he's not.
He's no long man.
That's like putting privilege goggles on the same level as
long as you think C is pretty decided that B is one strong
meme a is like either one strong meme with a couple of bonus
memes and then S is like several strong memes and S plus is
like several great memes.
Which would be with the expectation of more means to come
which puts Jim Sterling in like a C surely.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's just not really bright or anything.
So what culture is next D D.
Yeah, I'm even having trouble kind of remembering.
Yeah.
Next up is always that never look.
Oh, yes, it's Jeff Nichols.
Jeff probably will be a we don't know how those memes are
going to last in my guess.
Yeah, I think a is fair because there's some great memes
have come out of it.
We don't know how long they'll last sure.
I could see be though.
I'm happy to agree with AFF runs.
We're going to be fine with AABBAADB God see I just don't
know that those memes haven't like caught up to me yet.
So I don't know got a lot of different takes the Jeb Bush
meme.
I don't know how long that'll last.
I don't know what's going to happen with it.
I think it's strong.
My name is Jeb.
What else was there in that stream?
There's a lot of stuff.
Yeah, because it was like just it was more wrong than Mimi.
Sure.
It was flat out wrong.
Oh, she what was it the direct quote where she said I think
it was exactly these words watching fantastic beasts gives
me immense sexual satisfaction.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm always coming for fantastic beasts.
I think I knew it the first time.
I'm looks like that might you think that isn't a I think
that's not there's no way it's nothing to know.
Well, we've got we know we've got all the thing is with a
is like one strong meme with several memes or several media
memes like she's got a extremely strong name and a couple
of other.
Yeah, I mean still making Jeb jokes when the damn stream
started today.
It was kind of nuts.
Yeah, you know, it might not last who knows but I think
an A is a safe spot for now a provisional a yeah, because
A is like middle she could go lower or higher as time
progresses.
You think we should hold on to this in case these are subject
to change like somebody might start like come up with a
really crazy-ass meme.
We'll have to compare your lists.
Yeah, let's compare a year from now.
So insider.
I don't even remember covering insider D.
No idea what it is.
If we can't remember who this is they go to D.
Yeah.
Who D.
All that game of for bars.
I remember us covering him briefly.
I just wanted to find but I don't think any memes can
get it was probably a D reg because he's terrible, but
I don't think any beams come out of it.
His meme ability is low D.
What's the FBI?
Frame by frame.
That was the guy who did the video on how Ray's not a
Mary Sue, I think.
We covered it during the 50th with doom cock and critical
drinker.
I think.
No idea remembering any memes from it though.
I don't remember it.
All right, off to D.
Sorry man.
Extra credits.
Oof.
You're a Nazi.
Yeah, it's like that's like prime meme like and it was
in general.
I know this is just an efap thing, but man when they made
that video that has been like I think it might be one of
the most respond.
Oh, sorry.
Frame by frame is sword like weapon.
Oh, that person is not even.
Oh, maybe even be yeah, it's a strong meme, but I think
we receive because these strong memes are pretty damn
strong.
Yeah.
Stick like weapon.
Yeah.
All right.
No, that's fair and then ask for extra credits.
What are we looking at here?
They were between an A and B.
A A A B.
Yeah, I'm happy with a like this overall means like oh,
yeah, but that's like a like a general meme for everyone to
be honest.
It's not like efap exclusive.
So I would actually go for B personally.
Yeah, that in mind B is looking a little more.
I'll fight with that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I can agree with that too.
I'm all right with that.
DX.
What was DX's video?
Is that that's not sausage man, right?
The sausage man is criminal.
No, we had him on right.
DX was a subjectivity.
That was a he's the Holocaust denier.
Wait, really?
He actually deadly to die.
No.
It just I think he just misspoke in a really weird way.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Probably see.
What is what are the memes?
Because I remember the conversation.
I'm trying to remember any memes that came from it.
Chat helps out.
Sorry.
I've been playing some cards on the side and I haven't got
Piccadilly yet.
I don't think you can derive joy from a fictional event.
Oh, he said words only have one meaning.
Oh, was that him?
That was him.
Wasn't it?
That's probably a B.
Ooh, that might be a B.
I like we've made a certainly no longer boring.
Kind of looks like a Christmas tree.
What we have right now.
Yeah, like half a Christmas tree.
I mean, it's just the star on top.
Yeah, although that in mind,
who's going to have anybody here's God like exactly.
What's looking at this list?
Well, you know, we're going to we're going to go through a
revision at the end.
We're going to take a look at the list, adjust accordingly
based on where everyone else because at the beginning,
we didn't have any reference.
So now that we're getting there at the end, we can go through
watch Mojo.
I think that's a D right.
I don't remember.
I'm sorry.
I hate to I hate to bring this up.
But Cosmic Chicken Goliath.
Oh shit.
Watch Mojo memes.
That was that stream.
That's like I would consider that Efap honorary Efap.
Wow, that was an amazing stream with cynic snacks until
that's non-canon made by Disney when they non-canonize after
that probably actually lifts them up to at least a I might
even say S.
Yeah, this Goliath cosmic chicken.
Yeah, those were the only memes in that stream.
Were they surely though?
I swear there were more in that.
That's the meme.
What that's the stream.
We got like a tonal congealed in a cave.
Oh God, that's an orphan Lord.
Yeah, that's it.
Wow.
That's that's that's that's definitely.
Yes, that's my love.
How much has got nothing to do with what it wasn't.
It wasn't it wasn't the your are orphans like got continued
there.
They didn't originate that true, but a lot of the significant
orphan law did come.
Yeah.
What do we think?
They came from there is still like an S still like an S.
That's that's that's weird because wolf just said that's
a godlike meme.
Really?
Well, the cosmic chicken is a god.
I guess we could put them in there.
Mo.
Oh man.
Mojo is actually a orphans cosmic chicken.
Tonaled congealing.
They get like status for no reason of their own.
Like it's yeah, but that's the problem is the a lot of the
memes that generate because of us.
Anyway, so I don't I don't think we can give them godlike
status because they didn't it's not and none of them is
there for like at all.
No, I'd still say it's S.
They just got lucky.
I'm fine with S because I think what Jay is saying is a
good point where it wasn't really them in any way at all.
It was us.
We're there because of watch.
Well, Joe, they they only spoiled like to attribute it
solely to whatever they say they'd be indeed.
No, yeah, but no, they did spawn like the deserts.
I think we give them credit for the fact that that's a
meme that didn't move on in any way though.
That stayed right there.
We got a lot of that fake that happened on their watch, which
I think we need to give them credit for which a lot of
credit for those memes, but they didn't actually do anything
for it.
So they can't be super high.
All right.
So what is what you're saying?
A now a yeah, a is think I think is appropriate.
I think yeah, I'm fine with a fine.
Okay, because of that.
Yeah, all right.
If we're consistent with that.
Scipulation a yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I agree.
Next up is I don't know who that is.
Lee Dave Lee Down Under Down Under.
No, this thing was I can't even look like I will fight.
I'll find out from you have 43.
Was it 43?
I'm not sure what I can't I remember.
I know what it was.
It was the fact that you guys can't even remember is probably
evidence for how it was a D.
We almost gave watch Mojo a D though.
I mean, technically, I still think they kind of deserve it.
It depends on what the ruling is the complication.
If we really had to go, I would say at least see but I say
they're all right a day right now.
Anyway, this guy.
Who is he if we establish that?
Well, that's the problem.
I'm still trying to actually figure out something from like
chat to be able to explain this because I I don't remember.
Oh, it's Dale.
I think.
Dale's a lot of stuff.
Was it which was Dale the one that was like men hate Star
Wars or the rooting star?
That's the next one.
No, it's not.
Oh, that's no, that's the one you're on there.
So the stream was behind for me.
Yeah, there's a little behind too.
I've refreshed it twice now.
It's like way.
It's just a YouTube latency.
It's not what you can do about it.
Yeah, men are ruining Star Wars.
See, there's not a lot that actually stayed from even his debate
portion and the video because it was just terrible.
I think it was the fact that you didn't stand for any of it.
COD.
Probably C.
Yeah, I'd say C.
I have no idea.
I don't know the guys.
Next up is Sausage Man.
A yellow pipe in Sausage Man and very like not super strong
memes, but they I think it puts them at a B.
Apparently film was cinema Roberto gave Dark Fate 7 out of 10.
What is this happening?
Good joke.
Yeah, people are saying B.
BC mainly B.
So what did he do?
It was the yellow pole Sausage.
Oh, the yeah, yeah, the yellow pole guy.
I feel like there were more from that stream though.
Are we missing anything?
I think drink that stream halfway through.
Yeah, and I came back at the end.
I would probably place in between B and C, but I'm liking
B so far.
Sausage was pretty good.
We got a we got a few really good drawings out of that.
Sausage Raider.
That was good shit.
Yeah, I have no memory of any of those.
Yeah, I'm putting on B.
I would say B.
B then I guess.
So be it.
Next one is like a seat picture.
I'm trying to see what is that comic book cast to
thanks to this last song.
Which one was this?
Yeah, I don't remember.
Looks like a microphone to me.
Dude, I really love how useful this site is that we've got
here.
It's so crazy.
Who are these people?
They were covered during.
Wait, what did I write?
Efap six.
Holy shit.
Wow.
Wait, really?
Oh, the guy the guy who had like oh my god, this is a deep
blow.
Right?
Do you remember this?
He was like trying to look at all the things on.
Oh my god, so so nostalgic.
He's he had like Wolf was disappointed because he had a
whole bunch of witcher stuff.
He's I think he was his whole video was basically saying
that TLJ sold well, so it's not that bad.
I do remember this is going back.
Oh, I think I do remember like I remember.
Yeah, the toys this guy that we've completely forgotten
about him though.
Yeah, that's gotta be the status.
Yeah, probably.
Yeah, wait, so it's not it's not useful because they sell
toys.
Who said that?
No, that's I think that's combining Quinton's quote
about Rags.
Quinton said that Rags thinks a movie is objectively bad
if it sells toys.
Right.
I don't understand that statement.
Next up.
We got closer look which is pretty epic celestial even
bone-chilling.
Epic celestial bone-chilling bone-chilling and can't do
the voice.
Yeah, chilling.
B or D.
What's not BOC?
What?
No, he's getting like an A.
Really?
You think that's A?
Dude, people are saying epic and celestial all the fucking
time.
I say it on my stream like every time says it constantly.
Pick up a few steel.
I'm comfortable with it.
What do you think chat?
We got a c a c a a a a k a a c for celestial a a b a c
for celestial.
I guess a is where he's where he's sitting.
Fighter productions.
Who dat?
Who dat?
Code them on 50 apparently.
Oh.
Like Tori.
I don't remember fighter productions.
Nah.
Part one.
I don't productions.
Tism.
So when I wish I could check this guy who did the Civil
War coverage.
That wasn't very good.
I think it's a D.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah D.
Sorry fighter productions.
Then we got a guy who he's prototype Patrick Willems and
yet.
Well, Patrick Willems stole from him.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
D.
Yeah D.
Like I bet a lot of people are probably like shocked to see
that face.
I'm surprised that you remembered it because I was about
to try and explain.
That's who he was.
Yeah, he's basically the whole plot holes.
People shouldn't focus on plot holes thing that Patrick
Williams did.
This guy did it too.
So he has got one slight meme.
Oh, yeah.
I redrafted this nine times over 11.
Yeah, he did say that.
Yeah, but did anyone ever use that?
Is that that's where I've heard that come up again.
He's not totally memeless.
Is that what D is?
I thought D was like, you know, cinema sins is plank.
It doesn't matter.
The planet is just sure actually.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's key.
I'm okay.
He's D.
Vox.
We covered them saying that the X-Men cinematic universe
makes a lot more sense than Marvel's.
No, no.
Yeah, I just say that.
That's a D.
I can't remember anything else about that video.
I mean, Vox is a meme, but nothing even related.
No, we don't even reference much of anything about it.
Yeah.
Now we got Wisecrack who created Allen.
The middle is the best thing ever.
We're lost forever.
This is my favorite part.
Bass.
That's a pretty high meme.
That's pretty.
I'd say A at least.
Probably say A.
So we're looking at between A and S.
What is that?
Allen, the middle.
And I think wasn't that the Mihai Cheek sent Mihai stream.
Put him in A because that's the middle rank.
I don't know, man.
We've just well, no, it's it's sure it's in the middle.
But tonaled is tonaled and we have no god likes yet.
I'm put.
I think you should be an S.
This is pretty strong meme material.
There needs to be a tier separating everyone else from tonaled.
And that's god like.
Well, we'll figure it out.
It's all right.
Yeah, I'm okay with S.
Yeah.
Mihai Cheek sent Mihai.
All the middle stuff.
Allen.
Yeah, Robocop or Republican.
Oh, that's like A or S.
Loud soup.
Our camel is a lesbian.
Oh, Robocop.
There's a ripoff.
Duff fader.
Yeah, Robocop.
I think S.
Cause C3PO is a gay butler.
Time when I was to apex homosexual.
Oh, yeah.
Apex homosexual.
Yeah.
I'm convinced S.
S.
Then we've got the fucking shit of him wanting to build a theocracy on Mars.
Oh, shit.
We got no bullshit.
So suspicious amount of women.
Suspicious amount of women.
That's the amount of women.
Giant midget.
Giant midget.
So with that, so far, he's B.
Say at least a B.
Can we think of any more that came of that?
He just get referenced a little bit.
Yeah, I think he said he does get referenced a lot.
That's right.
And I feel like his memes you could do a lot with them.
Mm-hmm malleable memes suspicious amount of women will never die.
Yes.
I've never heard that before.
Oh, this is trans.
Yeah, this is trans.
He did say that is trans.
What the hell the trans human?
Overrepresentation of giant midgets thing, of course.
Perfectly balanced.
Yeah.
So is everyone happy with B?
Yeah, I'm fine with B.
Yeah.
Just from what I've heard, I'm fine with B.
Yeah.
Oh, my goodness.
Just right.
S plus.
Just right.
God like in meme factory.
Well, let's read a response theory.
Damn it.
We've got read a response.
That's yeah.
The giddiest is ironic.
Oh, yeah, ironic.
He's ironic.
So those three alone get him to S plus, I think.
Yeah.
And so we had the people don't remember why we're pretty great as
well.
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
And then there was the debate that you guys had with him.
Oh, God.
The robot.
We said people came from that.
People don't remember.
There's the fact that you like first viewing first viewing.
Oh, yeah.
Didn't notice that God like.
I don't I don't know if that's God like because S plus is so
strong.
Yeah, it is.
I might put I probably put a mess plus.
Oh, good.
Rats is brown table guys.
It's not good.
Rat is brown table.
Table's covered.
Brown table is fantastic.
So people are saying good rat.
So I'm Karl Marx.
This reminds me of Karl Marx.
That's that's your.
That's brown.
Yeah.
So we got to wait for brown tables.
Okay.
Did he say did he say evolve as a critic?
Yes, he did.
Oh, I think he's got like I think we have a God like I think
we've got God like memes here.
Damn.
Oh man.
Chat one for God like to first s plus just just report because
I almost feel like wanted to never work city keeps him from God
like it's like four of them have worked.
Oh, man.
You also have to say God like to talk about Cora.
We have to bring up an 18th century German philosopher.
Hey, Jay.
Hey, Jay.
Oh, it doesn't work.
Look at those ones.
Look at him.
Yeah, he's got like yeah, it's settled.
Congratulations.
Just right.
You are the God like if at me, you are the God like he said me.
It's so great because he's such a pretentious youtuber.
So what do you mean of a giant beam?
He's extremely pretentious and his brain size can't justify it
which makes it so Mimi.
Next up is high top brain which would obviously probably rank
as a D.
I don't remember him being named at all.
Hi top.
It's got some not great videos, but he's I don't particularly
remember anything Mimi about it.
Um people this people every once in a while people will ping
and say what about Wags is like that guy's not on here.
Yeah, Wags.
Wags is IHE's buddy on the podcast.
We can we can barely say that belongs to IHE.
So yeah, definitely.
Yeah, it's not even IHE.
It's the IHE's buddy.
Wags won't be on here.
Unfortunately.
He was in he was on the island of speech impediments.
He can't help it, but it's still a meme.
If only he made a channel that we covered.
Yeah, he made a channel.
I'm sure he'd have amazing takes.
Wait, um, he references.
That's actually not a terrible idea.
This is such a bizarre stream.
Just FYI.
So I don't know.
All right.
So yeah, I'm fine with high top being just a D.
So we got Hello Greedo.
Hello Greedo.
At least B.
I'd say at least B as well.
Yeah.
What are his memes?
So I couldn't think of a waste of time more than debating art.
Right.
I got that.
What an interesting person.
I don't know that you might be a C because there's the problem
with his memes.
They don't last from what I remember.
He is himself a meme.
True.
True.
But does that get you to be status?
I think so.
Yeah, I will extra credits and Patrick Willems are certainly
memes.
Yeah, I guess Jackson is kind of a meme.
Oh, you.
Yeah, I certainly say I think when we mention Hello Greedo,
I in probably a fairly substantial part of the audience thinks
of him as a meme.
Like we don't take him seriously.
I'm just remembering his TIE fighter.
His TIE fighter.
Yeah.
And his he where he streams wearing a helmet.
Why the fuck bother?
Why have set up a face cam so that then cover your face.
So no one can see it.
A helmet.
Did a meme come out of him when people talk to him on stream
at one point?
Yeah, that was mainly just him misunderstanding.
You've had memes are not really like okay.
I wasn't sure if he said something like in response and
it kind of came out wrong.
I'm not I can't remember wearing a mask for a face cam.
That didn't like that was more just a joke that rags made.
That was funny.
Like it doesn't really evolve into anything of a meme.
Yeah, say with the TIE fighter.
I think he is himself.
So yeah, his his mind our Minecraft skills memeable.
Not really everyone's typing in Jamaican.
Oh, yeah, because you're making it up.
Yeah, he looked up massive.
Oh, yeah, and then it was Jamaican.
That's what he said.
Well, this is why I think he's probably that makes him be.
Yeah, I said be all right, then all right.
Yeah, it I think he's been around long enough.
We've covered him long enough and he's brought us enough
joy and laughter that he's elevated out of the sea quagmire.
Yeah, welcome to be welcome to be here.
So we got to the young ticks that one video from Joker.
We watched.
I remember the video.
I'm trying to think of women.
The funny thing is that it opened with just say Joker hates
black people or whatever.
It doesn't like black.
Yeah, has a problem with black.
Right, right.
Yeah.
Either.
I I'd probably put him in D.
Yeah.
I care.
I don't think we spent too much time with it.
Well, it was only a three-minute right after that.
It wasn't a very long video.
It was only three minutes, but it was horrible.
Oh, yeah, it's it's TYT man.
That's the thing shit in terms of quality of videos.
We'll do that next.
That should be easier than this because there's not going
to be as much memory.
Yeah, but uh, yeah, he's a captain midnight.
Deeks.
I can't remember.
Yeah, yeah.
Angry Joe.
So we got Joe senior out of him, but that's not really
something we can equate to him.
Yeah, Joe is kind of an offensive in that regard.
He just has bad takes.
He ranks movies really badly.
Yeah, suicide squad kind of his problem.
Angry Jew.
Yeah, angry.
Does that mean he's a see that probably does that put him
up to see angry?
That's how long that meme lives.
Really angry.
Dude, you're brand new all the press.
Yeah, so yeah, I'd say they're God's chosen people.
Oh God, next up is movie Bob.
SRS plus.
The entire chat just says angry Jew.
So you said S right away.
Why do you say that?
The man is a meme like he is.
That is the kind about him being a meme isn't enough to
push him that high.
So what else we got?
Yeah, yeah, but he's a prominent meme.
Like he's the biggest meme creator.
Yeah, but just being a meme only gives you.
I get it because he is a meme because he thinks so highly
of himself.
He thinks he's the biggest fucking galaxy brain ever.
Now we're really not done like Christina Hoff Summers on
Twitter recently.
I can't really just like the metanarrative shit.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, the talking fast shit.
All of the memes were bad wolf quit wolf had enough and
you know, he not just killed several people.
He killed Jay Longboat.
I think as well as well.
I'm fine with him being be because of that.
Like like he has a reputation.
I was gonna say doesn't he fits in with be Patrick Willems
and Jackson and extra credit.
Yeah, I'd say he's starting to shape up to be very consistent.
No bullshit.
These are all meme people.
Yeah, but their memes themselves are weak.
Yeah, the memes themselves aren't too fantastic.
But those people my goodness.
All right brown table.
And ironically, I don't know if I'd sell for anything less
than s plus.
He's a sexual harassment.
Why are we talking about brown table?
Brown table is coming out.
Yeah.
Good rat.
I like it.
You must be good.
Yes.
Him as well.
That was that was just right.
Are there any other good brown table memes?
I like this not his entire right.
So yeah, this reminds me of Karl Marx.
Yeah, we had the whole the whole Zootopia thing was because
of him.
How he was a laugh riot.
I love tables videos.
He's all like if he carried on in the exact same quality,
he would start to get to a tonal for me.
Like he would start to get to a time as it stands probably s
plus and he acknowledged.
I don't know if I put a rough s plus s I I would well,
yeah, because I got to put him above Republican and Wisecrack
and all them.
Yeah, I'd say s plus brown table.
They can do to called sexual harassment and Skillshare.
Someone saying Skillshare.
Did have the way wasn't that a closer look that did the that
stuff or am I thinking the like the Russo's would benefit
from from some creative writing.
Oh, the nobody comes to my birthday thing.
That's all.
Yeah, that's how we laughed our asses off.
Oh my goodness.
Someone says Batman is a symbol of Batman.
I remember that quote.
Where was it from?
That's his Batman in Dark Knight Rises video.
We did on 50th.
That was really bad too.
Brown table.
So special.
I love it.
Make more than saying the dawn was brown table.
The dawn was brown table.
What?
Oh, no, no, the dawn was like I know a lot of people are struggling
to remember, but like I said, I know for a fact that robot had
created the meme with us and he was on the stream where we covered
I am that Robbie who did the first video on Captain Marvel.
He's the guy who said that I'm like the reason we first covered
it was because he like took a shot of me and we were like,
okay, and then we started doing a couple of Captain Marvel
ones and so the dawn originates with I'm not Robbie but it got
bolstered over all the Captain Marvel videos for sure.
Yeah, next up is I don't know this channel is cold, but I know
the video we covered from them was the Game of Thrones one
where they're trying to argue that it wasn't too dark and
other things tree sickle.
This is one of the few videos we actually stopped watching
because it was just so fucking worthless.
Yeah, then that probably put some on D.
It was automatic to keep us going.
Next is snowman gaming D.
I can't remember anything about someone in his video.
No clue.
Yeah, and we actually spoke to him as well.
I can't remember that.
Yeah.
All right.
Now we got Seamus Gorman D.
I can't remember what we covered.
Get no Game of Thrones fans.
You don't deserve better.
Was that him?
Jesus.
That was him.
Yeah, I don't remember that's part of a bad take than a mean.
It was all about stuff him saying like I just want a video
with a million views.
Right.
Yeah.
Next one is Chef Rilla Productions.
I think and he he did the video on thing.
It was endgame.
We covered it with critical drinker.
I still want to click whole night to cover.
We didn't talk about it.
We got on tangents so many times.
It wasn't even a particularly awful video.
If I think we concluded and that we just it just nothing came.
It's like me.
Do you think it's a D thing is lower than that?
All right.
And I'll finally get tested.
Yes, an IRL.
Yes.
Oh my.
So let's say we got the Christmas music at the end.
Christmas music.
The world is better off with today.
Yeah.
I was on with that.
Say that.
But no, I don't think there were any memes.
Well, those I think would easily become me.
He's a he might be B tier.
He's he's a meme for sure.
He's certainly recent.
I think if he was less recent, we'd be putting him in D.
Some people are saying D for the pain.
CD.
Maybe C then.
Well, that's yeah.
Yes and be gone.
Oh, he said walk of shame is sexist.
Oh, that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Even after we explain that both men and women have to do it.
It's still sex.
It's first done to a man.
So it sounds like people saying Lee in the skies.
Yeah.
I'm yeah, it's hmm.
So those get him up to sea.
I think that is a sea surely.
I think he hasn't would be sea level.
Yeah.
Walk of shame is sexist.
Daenerys was better for the world.
Christmas music.
Yes and be gone was a thing that happened a lot.
The lispy voice.
I would say that's a B.
I it's quite a repertoire already.
And tell the fact that he himself is a meme.
I do see sympathy for B right now.
See what's a realist.
He might not age too well over time.
But yeah, he's a B.
Was it brown tape?
So I've said I've seen this once or twice in the chat.
Did the brown table say plot holes don't affect the plot?
Because I saw it before but now that somebody else has said that.
I don't know.
So it's reasonable to me.
I don't know.
It sounds like such a Patrick Willems thing to say.
Oh, apparently snowman gaming gave us weird grape and blessed
pikeman.
I don't think blessed pikeman came from Jared Jared was blessed
pikeman.
Yeah, when he was on stream.
Yeah, when Jared came on but my giving might have given us weird
grape, but I'm almost certain.
All right come from his video.
If it was I think brown table saying that potholes that does
that elevate brown table to God like.
Yes, if we confirm brown people did say that if it's if we
can confirm it then yes.
If someone can give us a all right, tell you what brown table
will be elevated to God like if someone can give us a video
and a timestamp for when he says plot holes don't affect the
plot. I'm assuming it's the Dark Knight Rises one.
Yeah, because this is because if just to be certain if there's
some hero in chat, you can do that.
Who remembers that we get this right because this is like
Southpaw said yes, I reached about that.
Remember God like it's no big is a big deal.
We got to make him you know, I'm starting to feel like that
might yeah, maybe yeah, but because we just because of the
sanctity of the God like tier.
We have to be sure this is like making someone a saint the
canonization process is really important.
So we got to make sure.
So let me see so look.
It was the Dark Knight Rises video.
He said it we got a lot of people saying certainty Southpaw
is a video on it.
He said.
That moment.
Well, I yelled the film like a lot of films is layered with
the possibilities like how did Bruce heal is back so quickly.
Are we doing it?
Are we pushing them?
I'm currently listening to this.
So if everyone just listen to this like 10 seconds, how do
you get back to Gotham exists, but having no relevance to
the plot in any way.
So having no relevant plot in any way.
Yeah, it exists, but having no relevance to so yeah, you I
can't remember what the fuck is rationale is, but he kind of
says the plot holes aren't relevant to the plot in any way.
Okay.
Yeah, that but that puts him a godlike.
Yeah, I think that's the level of just graduations Brown
table.
Good job Brown table.
That's not a level of just because it's bad doesn't mean
it's bad.
Yeah, but we've already decided where he is and he will stay
there forever in our hearts.
So is this it?
This is our meme meme tears.
We've done it.
All right.
So let's so here's what we'll do before we call it.
Let's go to the first couple in each row because those were
made early and now that we've kind of filtered everything to
now that we've got a better relative view of what the tears
are.
Let's see if we need to reevaluate some of the earlier
spots that we gave out.
Are we just redrafting a tier list?
No, no, no.
We're just taking the first fit.
No, no, no.
We're just the first in the first and a special of these
kids the ones we did earlier.
It's okay.
It was a joke.
Calm down.
We power through it.
Yeah, it's power through it.
I was joking.
Yeah, I guess if there's any maybes.
Well, I suppose the best way to do is everyone have a look.
Is there anyone you think shouldn't be in the tears?
Yeah.
I'm hearing I'm hearing snowman should be bumped because of
the weird grape and the first ragswolf elevator music argument.
Lot of listeners have some names in there.
Yeah, I don't know.
No one I don't know if hmm.
Sarah Z could move down to get rid of the obnoxious gap.
There's a part of me that wonders if there's anyone and
see who should be D.
Well, for the memes for weird puppet person, who is that weird puppet person?
I know the action figures.
Oh, Shinobi.
Oh, Shinobi.
Any reason he shouldn't be D.
Was there any?
I don't think any memes came out of it.
We just we just kind of remember him for the guy that blew his
channel up after we covered him and then he like came back shortly after.
So that was memorable, but not really meme-y.
You know what I mean?
I swear I remember us naming a meme from him.
What chat chat?
What what meme is credited to him?
Oh, I'm hearing a lot of people in chat say that Patrick Willems
should be eight here.
I agree.
Yeah, I've heard I've seen the same thing.
I'm fine with that because that's up there with Quentin and
it does feel right.
But I don't know.
We couldn't reference much from him that we couldn't reference the
same for BTO.
Yeah.
So let's do a quick recap.
Patrick Willems, you're watching movies wrong.
Space Wizards intended for children.
Yeah.
Star Wars is Space Wizards intended for children.
Just something.
Reviewers don't get paid a lot.
I would say that we yeah, he did say that.
Yeah.
Reviewers don't get paid off.
A review of Black Panther from the 20 year old white guy isn't
gonna have any.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's A for me.
That puts racism puts him into A for me.
Yeah, totally.
Racism gets you in A.
Racism gets you up to A's here.
Not to mention he said like Green Monster is my favorite and
you should go away and you're not my friend if you don't agree
or some shit.
Oh, yeah.
He loves the porgs.
Yeah, if you don't like something in The Lost Jedi,
I don't want to be your friend or I think it was porgs.
Wasn't it?
No, he talked about the milk monster.
He said that was his favorite new thing.
Yeah, you went in for that.
Right.
There's a highlight for me.
That's one of the first like explosive efap highlights.
Yeah, me Appa Band of Wolf lost our shit.
Yeah, so he's coming.
Yeah.
All right now chat.
I think chat was right on that one.
Yeah, A's here for Patrick Willems, especially because we
forgot the racism, right?
I'm wondering if we should move anyone down from C to D.
When you look at the C tier, is there anyone there that you're
like, man, I don't remember fuck all about this.
Are we Filmjoy?
Yeah, I was going to say, hailing Chloe of Marines.
Yeah, but who actually who like people remember it when you
bring it up, but it's one of those that's a feature that
no one else has.
He wrote something that was awful like, all right.
In a game.
I mean, it's kind of weird.
You got like a whole like efap gameplay.
The first one.
Yeah, that's the thing.
Yeah, that's right.
Efap gameplay played that game.
So that's attributed to him though.
I don't know.
It's like, all right.
Well, if this is an efap villain thing, so by playing his game.
When we were playing it, we weren't really critical of the
story that much.
It was way more the mechanics.
Yeah, the writing wasn't the worst part.
It was the fact that we were playing the game.
From what I understand, the writing is dreadful, but that's
not really what the efap gaming episode was focusing on for
the tism, was it?
Yeah.
So, so does he belong in C or D?
Probably D, honestly.
I'm moving him down to D.
Plus it makes her chart look neater.
Didn't Joseph Anderson have some really good books as well?
Just write with books.
Yeah.
He, I mean, Joseph Anderson isn't, is an acclaimed author.
What was it?
What were his books called?
Oh, it's still a near seller Marines.
Oh, yeah.
Does that bump him up?
I don't think that pushes him to S plus S plus.
Yeah.
Not as well.
Yeah, I wouldn't.
Yeah.
He's definitely not S plus material, but he's definitely S.
I'm seeing a lot of Jay's godlike in the chat.
I'm proud, but I don't agree.
Yeah, I think Jay's too smart to be godlike, if that makes
sense.
Like Jay's just gonna clip that.
I think Jay's too self-aware.
Like just right has no fucking clue how pretentious he is and
how much he can't back it up.
But he really thinks that he is like super galaxy brain.
So I think that's part of why he's so, you know, he's so
godlike in terms of meaning.
And the brown table is just glorious.
Brown table is like, yeah, we're talking, he is almost
like the like discount tonaled, which is already tonaled
sun or something.
Brown table, son of tonaled.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm happy with this tier list.
I'm pretty happy with this.
Yeah.
Thought it out pretty well.
Someone's just saying tonal should have a higher tier.
Now we don't need to exaggerate it that much.
When you go above godly, there's just no, you know, there's
nothing above that.
Um, but yeah, I suppose we could, this took way longer than
I expected.
I don't know if it's weird.
What a shock.
If we do another tier list for the quality of those content
creators, that might take another.
Feel like this is on stream almost.
Yeah, actually the whole reason we did this is to actually
have a show people beeps.
Yeah, we'll do that.
We can always come back later and do it.
Yeah, we'll do it again at some point.
We'll actually, we'll do all the efap villains in terms of
quality of content.
I mean, I'm prepared.
I just ordered some food.
I'm here for the long run.
Tonal stays in his tonal tier for that, right?
Oh, uh, tonal video.
I don't know.
We'll have to decide that when we get around to it, I guess.
You know, I don't fucking know.
Tonal tries to send any form of quality.
All right, so there's a lot of memes that I've collected and
the way this is gonna have to work is the, it's, well, it's
the way it normally works, but I may have some difficulties
with how these tabs are working.
I hope nothing goes wrong and that no one notices anything.
I'm just warning you ahead of time that I might need to take
time to do things.
But anyway, let's start with this one is not technically a
meme, but I think we all need to be aware of it.
So Chuck Tingle is the guy who writes the books that Professor
Tospot often reads excerpts from and apparently did an AMA and
someone asked, have you heard of Professor Tospot's dramatic
reading of some of your books on eFap podcast?
It's great.
I believe he read out your gay donuts and unicorn books.
He said, no, I have not, but it sounds like this is a moment
that brought joy to many.
So I think it's probably a very good way and I'm glad to hear
about it.
I hope everyone had fun.
I thank you so much for telling me about this.
You've made my timeline a little bit brighter today.
That is very kind.
Thank you, bud.
Really fucking doesn't use punctuation, does he?
No notice to capitalize the eyes, but that's fine.
Who needs to do that?
We just had like a really wholesome comments like fucking
punctuation piece of shit.
It's just odd to see it from an author, you know, his books
are so eloquently written as well.
Is this really him?
So someone said, where's the loud soup in reference to his
noticing that his fucking audio symbol was on the thing and
he said it was a microphone side.
I figured out how to hide it.
I'm surprised that the Dubbies on eFap don't know what it
is. It's not a microphone side.
You read speaker.
That's a big old whoosh first off.
It's a yeah, it's a speaker.
We obviously fucking know it looks like loud soup on Vader's
forehead.
It's hilarious.
We've loved covering your stupid video.
It was amazing.
Give us more loud soup, please.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, so on to memes.
I'm going to try and I was going to say try and do this
fast, but no, no, it'll just take as long as it takes.
We'll involve the only Gex.
Am I the only person who knows what Gex is or I'm aware of
what Gex is because of that Hbombergau video?
Wasn't there an old energy drink that had like a lizard like
Sobey or something like that?
Yeah, I was Sobey.
There was yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wasn't really an energy drink though.
I think Sobey was just a I think it was just like a type
of juice.
I don't think I ever drank that but I did play Gex on Gameboy
at one point.
And the original looked like that's what the original cover
looked like.
Yep.
Yes, I never played that game did not age well at fucking
all.
All right.
It doesn't look good for it doesn't look good and he's got
like shitloads of references that were like 90s to like
90s celebrities and it's just please stop.
Please stop talking right now.
I don't know which game this is.
I'm sure chat will know but apparently there was a thing
called the molar in it.
Neat.
It looks really small.
He says you're supposed to zoom in idiot knows in the character
looks really small compared to the table in on the character
idiot.
Fuck a lot of these are going to be things that I show and
I even read out and I wonder how this happened.
There are two premises inside of you one is a massive.
The other one is a massive.
You are a massive.
Okay.
Yeah, yeah, I can't remember the context is these ones can
go back a long way.
So the screen we don't appreciate them.
Okay, they're wonderful.
Now for anyone who's seen kick-ass 2 will understand this
meme.
I like it.
I totally forgot.
There's a second one and most people forgot.
It's the second one.
Is this any good?
I hate probably not.
All right, I hated it first time when I enjoyed a second.
But you know, it's fine.
Oh look, it's a reference to when Jay was criticismed.
Congratulations, you're being critiqued.
Do not resist.
I thought it was pretty funny me watching Lord of the Rings
after Game of Thrones season 8 and the Last Jedi.
My friends, you bow to no one logical character progression
three-dimensional characters consistent message and themes
satisfying ending.
Those four were murdered across several other pieces of
media.
You see it was horrible.
Jay won't get this one.
I'm not sure what this one rags.
What is this?
Target.
What's the what is the grimace me?
Why don't I forgot the fucking the drawings?
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
That was but I'm wondering what doggo.
I probably called him McNuggers at some point.
Chicken McNuggers.
I'll have some chicken McNuggers.
It's a very graphic image.
That's terrifying in its own way.
In prehistoric times referred to him as the we managed to
imprison him in the Philippines Goliath has moved.
Goliath has chosen cynic snacks next target eyes on Goliath.
That's a haunting picture of snacks.
Yeah, that's cold.
That's nice images.
Like this is good shit.
I heard we showed this before.
I think there's been a few Singapore Singapore.
So Mel, you'll get this because you watched it recently.
Batman 89.
When he gets his revolver, it tends to be a lot longer than
expected and he fires the long at bad yoga days.
That's good.
That's applicable to the oh, yeah, we watched it.
So, you know, this will be a reference for efap gaming for
Steve who's definitely not an alien.
I promise I won't get political guys.
What bias cat later?
What was that?
Me and Mel actually own those t-shirts now.
I'm wearing it right now.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I'm gonna wear it tomorrow as well on stream if
you want to see it live.
It's a depiction of the efap war ongoing.
Why am I a little horseback?
Jen just asked what's the point of playing kotmoto player
if everyone is just going to camp with a shotgun?
I think that this is quite a good meme.
I appreciate.
It's funny because it's true.
It's a fact of life.
You should never ignore it.
Good shit.
This is from a Monty Python sketch.
This character was assassinated.
His actions big.
No sense.
No see Luke was a Jedi.
There's another word of that but it's different things for you.
We need to watch some Monty Python.
I haven't watched any Monty Python.
By the way, I want to I want to give a props to the person
who made that meme for doing Luke behind and inside of the
cage.
The actual pieces.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you had to mask each individual bar.
So congrats for the patience.
Yeah.
So that's I appreciate the effort.
That must have been frustrating writing TLJ.
Oh, definitely.
And who wrote this with the seagull beep?
Who wrote going on this?
There's so many kick J memes that are going to be coming
across.
This is one of my kicking boots.
I love the implication.
Wait is oh, no, no, no.
It's no I thought that the Isle of Man thing was actually
there.
It does look like it belongs.
It's the lighting on.
It's pretty good.
Mm-hmm.
It actually got me as soon as I zoomed in and realized.
Oh, okay.
What's the thing up in the Isle of Man that they have decent
tits in that picture as well?
Yeah.
Yeah, there's a lot to unpack with this one.
Freudian an Aristotle thing.
They just battle over to the corner.
We call it going to watch bad women so soon.
Objective facts.
Just swap those little demons away and you're good.
He's talking to Quinton and he's Bob a guy.
I don't think you understand.
Like gloop.
I gotcha.
Hey, he's Bob a guy.
I'm sure of the narrative here.
Does does Quinton betray somebody or or is he saying
he's going to defend his phone?
He's going to back him up.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't mind just being like a Hydra thing.
That's fine with me.
I'll be right back.
I quite like this ping pong.
I mean, it's just a photo someone took.
Okay.
It's realistic.
I don't know those words were just there.
Is this what looks to be a few long men?
A few long men but also recommend a few good men.
It's a good film.
It's quite a haunting image.
A few long men scribes what is clearly an event arguably
terrifying.
I like one of them is just the chat.
Our chats good enough to be a character in a lot of memes.
Oh, definitely.
So this is Zootopia on the sloth.
Definitely.
It's loaded.
May say may say fuck.
That's hilarious because he does at least say it once the
rest are bleeped.
This is one of those ones where I'm like fuck.
What's the context?
Pixels.
Pixel fucking.
Yeah, pixel fucking.
It literally says it in the URL.
Oh, you're right.
I'm retarded.
Well, this is pixel.
Fuck.
That's that's a far cry from pixel fucking.
Yeah.
I'm glad you back me up rags.
High five.
I'm not.
I'm kind of a jam.
I'm glad you back me up man.
I have food quite quite like this.
Funny.
Oh, no.
I wonder if they came across that by accident or that's what
they made them think of.
They're like, oh, that's definitely that, you know, this
is an actual poster and people just posted they want us to
comment on the fact that it's described as a massive finale.
And I guess they're really gunning for the whole women part
of it.
Oh, that was the best shot.
They had for several costumes at once.
I suppose.
It's a nice looking shot.
Well, I mean, it's good for showing costumes as well.
I guess it's just that there must have been a lot of options
for that.
I don't know.
But we'll see.
We'll be interested to see what Oscars are won for who.
This is a very important meme.
I think a lot of people will appreciate.
I love it.
God, that would hurt.
That is that is good rad right there.
I'm just sitting there thinking I'm just thinking I would
not be brave enough to sit there.
No.
That's my problem with this image.
Epic epic epic celestial.
Hefep original.
A savior has dawned.
Amazon Prime.
This is one of I think two memes of like apparently there's
like a long version of Meowth that came out for Pokemon.
I don't know what's going on there.
But yeah, apparently this is long now.
Meowth is long.
Long Meowth good.
Long Meowth good.
And this is the boys reference.
You got the fan base being like lately.
Some of you have been a little out of sorts erratic for solo
unreliable for Force Awakens.
Don't worry.
Sloppy for the last Jedi.
Not you though.
You've been great Vader comics.
I've not read Vader comics, but I'm a man.
Very good.
Mola Prime spook option.
I like it.
Both of the icons.
It works.
So I guess this is spook option.
Local military police in Brazil using buffaloes to patrol
man.
That looks cool as fuck.
It is actually kind of cool.
They're pretty.
They're pretty neat looking.
Yeah, we want to fuck with them.
Nope.
Oh, this is the other version of that meme I guess.
She's dead.
No, she's not dead.
She's resting.
Like her eyes are close.
So the original Simpsons thing for this is Bart is making
fun of a show for getting the knots wrong, I think, because
he's become a Boy Scout and he's getting good at it.
And he's like, they're getting the rots and accurate, the
knots, they're accurate.
And I'm homeless.
No, I think Lisa says they don't have to be realistic all
the time.
And then Homer walks by in the background while he's
sitting on the sofa in the room because it's just good
shit.
You got Ryan Johnson doesn't know squat.
Luke wouldn't try to kill his nephew in his own sleep.
Luke would have been trying to save Ben just like he did
with Anakin and the Jedi.
Oh, long man.
This is just a movie about space wizards for children.
You just see Ryan walking past in the background while
he's there.
I like to catch this Ryan subverting expectations.
It's good.
It's good shit.
I love Simpsons references.
So we got a big idiot.
He was a mathematician and philosopher.
Oh, yeah.
Someone just to ultimately look up to.
I love the fact that someone saw this and thought, I
don't have to do.
I know.
I know what I have to do.
Delicious things done right.
Right.
I like these ones.
So everyone's in their day to day and they're like, oh,
right.
Oh, food.
I have been drawn here for a purpose.
Now we got a what makes good rat in a classroom,
obviously.
He's really enjoying this lesson.
I mean, you know, we all need to learn about it.
Yeah, I'm thrilled.
So this is definitely an eFap meme.
But now I'm what was what am I missing?
That's Arkansas.
That's the state.
That's the state of Arkansas.
It's stopping you from counting to fifty five.
It's two, fifty three, fifty four, fifty four.
It says fifty four twice from counting fifty four, five.
Right.
Why?
Was this like eFap fifty five?
I mean,
I.
I don't.
Oh, I named I named the episodes wrong.
I think I think I named two fifty fours and I had to change it to fifty five.
But then I don't understand the rest.
Okay.
All right.
Check.
Decode this number of states.
We did two episode fifty fours.
But then what's with Arkansas?
All we can.
Yeah, I don't.
I don't understand.
Someone just said that's Wisconsin.
Fuck off.
I actually don't know what this meme is.
This may be a road road map to get this one here.
Maybe it's because I was like an I'm from Arkansas and even I know something,
something maybe hard to count.
Maybe he couldn't draw a dog and represented rags.
Arkansas was a good place.
You guys are talking about.
Is that it?
Yeah, we know it's about me, but I just I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know that this one is me.
All right.
We tried.
We tried our best.
I like getting sent images of people watching eFap.
There's a couple of them in here, but
he's got a little.
Oh, wait.
I think I might have shown this one because I remember saying like.
Rip all of those franchises.
He's got stuff for outside of Gears of Wars.
Yeah, Gears is fine.
Gears is fine.
Gears 5 is fine.
Terminator Fallout, though.
Yeah, Terminator Fallout.
And the eFap franchise is going OK.
So yeah, we're doing great.
Still strong.
How many how many how many TV series can say that they made it to episode 60 and
they're still going strong?
Oh, no.
Any adventure, they just simply aren't prepared.
That was me when I first watched a movie about video and he started talking.
I was like, stop, stop, stop.
Oh, I defeat this.
This is the dangers of often, I guess.
I haven't seen this movie, but apparently that's the thing that happens.
I don't know.
That's Christopher Lee.
No, I was fucking making a joke.
Idiot.
Also, this.
Hers.
And the dawn survived, so it's all good.
So as long as you've seen the shining, this works just fine.
Forever and ever.
Long live time's best seller.
Long live battle.
I'm not sure that's inherently much of a bad thing.
Oh, Quintonio.
Next up, we got.
So this was the dawn of bad takes us.
Got a joke.
This is so boring.
This is boring.
Jay, do you think you'll be?
Yeah, I think we got a I think I was right.
Someone in Chad is saying I'm from Arkansas and even I can count.
That's something that I said.
So that's probably what that means for.
OK.
See, I remember I remember someone bringing up something about Galaxy Quest as well
after I wasn't here.
Oh, I want to confirm that I have seen Galaxy Quest and it's much better than Spaceballs.
I love Galaxy.
I thought you were there for that because I remember mentioning like I love Galaxy Quest,
but I also love Spaceballs.
So I swear it happened when I wasn't there, but I can't be certain.
So maybe I just repeated myself.
I don't know.
This one's called Quinted Underscore Bed.
Fire.
Not quite.
It's got a load up for us.
This one.
It's slow for me.
Oh, facts and law constructor.
I love that he's so neutral.
He's just like.
Damn.
I'm burning.
I do not like this.
So this is in reference to the Gray Blobs.
There is an episode of Daily All Parents that represents it.
We said the most inoffensive thing you could have is a storyline with just everyone's Gray Blobs.
Yeah, apparently we weren't the first to come up with that.
I think this was when we were discussing how we started Pokémon and this is already a meme that exists.
And apparently like I don't know because I don't know the fuck all about Pokémon, really.
But apparently like the other three do actually suck more than Bulbasaur.
Is this is this a true?
It's almost like I said it for a reason.
Oh, well, I mean, I don't I already made it clear.
I don't care about their actual power levels.
I just don't want to play the retard.
Venus looks like no beast old man.
You compare that to Blastoise and Charizard like oh.
But a lot of people just assume because of the element, you know, the type that they are that, oh, Bulbasaur must be the worst.
He's just grass type.
He's like, oh, yeah, I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't go that far because I don't know fuck all about Pokémon in like the late stage and stuff.
Like I. Yeah, I was just saying.
Makes an incoherent tismy statement consisting of objective fallacy lashing out when they're feelings.
The channel is generally storming on opposition, throwing insults, ignoring contextual information,
or bringing political agendas into a conversation about media when unnecessary.
And I'm like, hmm.
And then Isle of Man.
I'm sorry.
The flitting mask there is disturbing.
It is kind of disturbing.
That is actually kind of strange.
Creepy.
The tongue.
Oh, God.
So for those who have seen Lord of the Rigs, no matter what comes through that gate, you will stand your ground.
It's movie Bob.
Run.
Run.
Also, if they're not displaying on Discord, you just got to click them.
As in.
Yeah, that was being annoying.
Or just get my stream open, I guess.
That's what I'm doing.
So this is wonderful new movie coming out starring Dishonored Wolf, Antoine Loke, called Hello All My Onwards.
Goliath cometh soon.
Holy shit.
I'm on the verb.
You are.
I really like the rhino and the hello all my onwards.
I really like that.
Goliath cometh soon.
Those mess ups didn't cut my pizza.
Faggots.
Oh, my God.
Use scissors or a pizza cutter.
Oh, it's Starkiller base in the background as well.
You have even knives.
What is Starkiller base?
Well, how about that?
Knives are worse for cutting pizza than scissors or pizza cutter.
Knives are worse than a scissors.
Wait, sorry, what?
If you want to cut pizza, scissors are better than a knife.
It's like your opinion.
Yes.
Ahoy, matey.
I love pirates.
Pirates.
I guess that's a yeah.
Pirates.
Oh, yeah.
All right, baby.
Hey.
Oh, this.
I'll just let anyone else realize the hilarity and
sument from that soon.
It's not load like it takes so like these aren't loading.
I got a middle mouse on the links.
Are you are you are you putting into the chat or are you putting the
image?
Are you pasting the image or are you pasting the link?
I'm doing the exact same thing.
I don't want to pop them up.
To see each one of them, I have to click them so they open up
in a browser.
I imagine it could be related to the fact that there's so many
now.
Maybe.
But I'm just doing the same thing I've been doing the whole
time.
But yeah, so in a straight line at full speed, the
resident class could be faster than a Thai F.O.
Space superiority fighter.
Here's the thing.
There is no fucking way it wouldn't.
Well, let's see.
Yeah, just OK.
So for those who aren't sure of what's happening, the joke is
that they say that anything that's small, small is going
to go faster.
Like they just.
Yeah, but this is space.
There is no wind resistance.
There is no atmosphere.
And look at the big fuck off engines on the back of that.
I mean, we don't even go by that rule.
If we don't just say it's smaller, therefore faster.
Yeah, like we don't go that way.
Have you ever seen something small and stationary?
I don't think you have.
Yeah.
Checkmate atheists.
Snails don't exist.
No snails.
Yeah.
So like obviously this isn't this is from like a wiki or
something, but it's not just frustrating how stupid TLJ
is.
Yeah, see, that's just a JPEG image.
So that should just show up, but it's not.
I don't know why.
Some of them are.
Try to just copy paste the image and see if it comes up.
Okay.
It could almost be worth just opening.
It's the same thing anyway.
It's because there are too many images in the chat.
It could be worth opening a new chat.
At that point that we'd have to start a call, right?
I guess.
But is that you could still you could still talk to each
other on a call, but be looking at the text.
Because it displays based on whatever's currently on
discord.
So yeah, I mean, I'll start a new call.
All right.
It's not a big deal.
We just click on them.
You sure?
Yeah, it's okay.
All right, then.
So yeah, when you bring me out, can you introduce me as
the dawn?
That's a good one.
Yes.
I like that.
This one's terrifying.
I'm looking forward to it.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Why me?
Me and Jay paying full attention, of course.
I don't like the poo poo.
We've been looking away from it.
Well, yeah, I guess both of us are.
But I think we're on board, which is sort of, you know,
we're like, we're looking knowingly into the camera.
We knew that someone was taking a photo of it.
And that's that's what's wonderful about it.
There's a lot of checkered shirts there.
The new in thing.
Oh, no.
That's a new Photoshop job.
There's another one of those words where it's just like,
so that speaks for itself.
It's actually a couple of, I Love Man is very successful.
Are you happy about that, Jay?
Yeah, that's one of my preferred memes.
Beautiful.
I've not seen the source for this, but the thing is,
I do kind of care about both themes and subjectivity.
Just not when they used for what they used for.
If you catch, if you pick up what I'm putting down.
Agreement?
Yes.
Agreements.
Agreements.
Remember this?
Yeah.
Super chat says the rooster.
See, this is something that's happened since the dawn of time.
It's a very beautiful.
We're just continuing a long human tradition.
I didn't know this was a thing.
One day they will dig this up.
The people of the future.
Isle of Man shoes.
Oh, my God.
If you draw feet on your shoes, it helps you run faster.
True.
Oh, yeah.
Kind of like the whole Reebok pumps thing back in the day.
Yeah.
It's like why a lot of race cars have stripes on them.
I don't know how Rags is going to feel about this.
Rags and molar go to Mars.
He's definitely the woman.
I'm a I'm a fit ship.
Titson.
Rags and molar go to Mars.
I like it.
The dawn presents tales from the eFap by Bill Barr.
Oh, yeah.
Remember when?
Bagtons.
What if you sent a link to Gmail?
Gmail.
It's a link to Gmail.
What the fuck?
Why have you linked to Gmail?
That's a wrong link.
Oh, it's a male attachment.
Oh, well, for this one, you can just pull up the stream, I guess.
I don't know how to make it stop.
Is that the same?
The Aiden one.
Yeah.
So when we told her about what Quinn said, she sort of just died.
A sequel is only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Classic Quentin.
That's insane.
Yes, it is.
That's one of those quotes where the more you think about it, the more you just.
I forgot when we were doing this.
Hmm.
I think we forgot to mention that when we're doing the tier list.
It's only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Oh, yeah, that would be one.
It probably doesn't change its rankings, but yes.
I agree.
I like this one, though.
I do too.
Protect attack.
Well, that one actually showed up as well.
Yeah, I'll show you this.
But that thing scared me.
That really is that picture, that one, whoever that was who made that.
The fucking three legs.
Oh, that's terrifying, man.
I don't think so.
Why is that the symbol of a nation?
I don't know.
I don't even know.
What?
Adopted the web.
I was.
Oh, man.
Being reminded of that stream is great.
Oh, that was such a crazy good stream.
I'm only checking the spider milk to learn the runtime of the next event.
Twenty four hours.
I love pirates.
Little cosplay.
Isn't that like the pirate from like SpongeBob or something?
Possibly, yeah.
Because the ship is its own thing.
Then Banjo Kazooie is.
It must be that and total space.
I like how jagged totals faces.
It's wonderful.
The suit will be perfect when it fits a critic.
Oh, no.
I'm not wearing that weirdly good Photoshop.
I was going to say it fits well.
Color scheme fits pretty well, too.
No, it's like you were made for this role.
Well, so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Well, it made sense to cover Batwoman, I guess.
You don't know?
Wait, what's the order for this?
It goes...
I'm trying to figure it out.
I think it's right to left because it's a weep comic?
Yeah.
If you want me to believe Fab is over, that's what happens when you Fab is over.
You don't know?
That's when you Fab begins, which is very applicable for the streams we were doing.
That is actually...
Yeah, that works really well.
Oh, I showed this one already.
Did we show...
I think we showed this one.
Biggitties.
Um...
Yeah, I think so.
Still good, though.
Oh, of course.
I've not seen this one.
Didn't get some form.
Heater.
Just a second.
Imagine they make such a scene over silly stage play for children.
Or sooth.
They are going beyond nitpicking for the tale of their own sake, and they are, in fact, murdering
the very concept of culture.
Fill a countryman.
Handeth me the hemlock, if thou will.
There's a guy in the background saying hi rags.
I lift the hand.
He's like, hey.
Silence, chest, cub, wizard.
Fucking boring.
I like the guy who's just fucking crying on the wall.
You'd think they would have attached a quote to that.
Tismy people rejected his message.
The last Jedi's objectively bad.
Shut up.
They hated one because he told them the truth.
Shut up.
The gender wizard.
Before I change you to look like a female, you may choose what female you look like.
You have two choices.
You can either look like a random woman of my choosing, or you can look like Brie Lawson.
Who shall you choose?
How are our responses?
He throws him off.
I think we put a wizard hat on a wrestler.
Monday Night Raw.
This is like...
This is almost worth...
This is actually worth posting to surreal vibes.
The gender wizard.
The gender wizard.
Super close.
Oh wow, that's a big one.
Oh yeah, we got...
We got loser references here.
Oh wow, yeah, that's a lot to look at here.
Oh, you got rats at the bottom left.
Who fucking did he come?
By the way, to the left.
Oh fuck yeah, I'm a snake.
Oh man.
Who's in Samus's mask?
Samus?
Is it Samus or Samus?
Samus.
Samus.
Who's in Samus's mask?
Oh yeah, it's really small, isn't it?
Oh yeah.
Can't make it out.
Yeah, I don't know who that is.
I've got the spider.
Kathleen, Kendi, Ryan, Johnson.
I would play this game.
Patrick.
Joseph.
It's a great shad face, they've chosen for that.
I'm guessing that's me as Peach.
Ice climbers are...
Oh, of course, Eric and...
Eric and Jack Sain.
Pikachu is the correct.
That woman is Bayonetta.
Oh no.
Theo is Young Link.
Southpaw's Ryu.
Doomcock is...
I guess that's Gannett?
Wolf is Wolf.
Ike is...
That guy.
Oh, FPF.
Oh, that's Bob.
I think FilmBob is Sonic, right?
I think that's, yeah, FilmBro.
FilmBro.
I like Joseph Anderson's Ridley.
Wolf is Wolf.
Wolf is Wolf, yeah.
Jay Longbone is the Inkling.
I'm using a long sword.
Yeah, it says long.
It makes sense that Joseph Anderson's Ridley
and Martha's shad.
Mahler is...
Quinton's Bowser.
Robot head is Mega Man.
That makes sense.
Some of these are pretty good.
Yeah, I like it.
Where's Nerdrotik and Drinker?
I don't know.
Terrible castle design.
Oh God, Karl Marx is leading the Pikmin NPCs.
Wait, wait.
In the middle, right beneath Jay.
Oh.
And the cosmic chicken is in the heart of it all.
There he is, I see him.
Oh yeah, the cosmic chicken.
I love it.
That's a good one.
I like that.
I like how they weren't just randomly posted on.
They are...
There is some sense to them.
I like the shad meme.
Oh.
This is pretty referential.
Yeah, everyone was like, Yasm was just...
Yeah, this is good.
I like this one.
I know a lot of people in chat were mentioning
something pretty similar to this.
Chat is a character again.
Hmm.
Why is everyone...
Why is everyone spelling it like that?
Yeah, did we do something about that that we said?
I don't remember.
So, not so great debate.
I can believe I spelled it like that.
Say he's old again.
Say he's old again.
I dare you.
I double dare you, motherfucker.
Say he's old one.
God damn tell.
Oh, poor Wolf.
Dealing with that.
This is apparently a character's name from Code Vein.
Everyone's like, oh my God, it's you.
You're also in Fortnite by that logic.
Oh, neat.
Oh, no.
I don't mind being able to tell.
So, this is...
Good Halloween.
That's not the only one I've seen.
Well, a Mexican Halloween is a thing, I think.
It was like the same logo and everything, but a poster.
This is actually pretty decent.
This could be used for stuff like a graphic.
Pretty cool.
It's the Buffy form.
Oh, yeah.
You slap it over stuff really easy.
Yep.
Good tisms.
I think Ra will like this one if you were here.
Oh, no.
Now that I can get behind that.
That seems about right.
I believe it.
It's a shamejerker doesn't throw it off.
A roof.
Subjective.
Oh, that's transparent too.
Yeah, it could be used for some stuff.
If we workable.
I think so.
How many times do we have to teach this lesson, old man?
It's a yes.
Yes.
And legacy, I suppose.
Yes.
And legacy.
So this is for the horizon for themselves.
An epap.
Car that has a manual rags, bringing in the tree on it.
The tree, I guess.
Yeah.
Looking sexy.
And as what will happen in the epap car.
It's kind of you can put like custom stickers and stuff.
What is that?
Oh, that's a game.
Yes.
It's not a real car.
It took me a second.
It took me a second.
Because someone actually go back to their fucking car.
And you're like, oh, there's a big logo that says Forza Horizon 4.
So the letter six.
Oh, yeah.
Yes.
Yes.
And was truly Major Lee in disguise or he was he was someone in disguise.
We're sure about it.
Got another movie about killing guests.
Maybe.
Stop it.
Okay.
You'll appreciate this.
Clorums.
I don't know why.
There's no context to that.
It's just me as a movie.
He is a movie.
I mean, there's enough for them to work with.
I can say it's a good part.
It's quality part.
So I love the idea that someone thought I have to make this.
He woke up one morning.
J.O.D.
Yes.
I like the Ros Felita into the Sun God thing.
It's it's getting old.
Oh, my God.
This is another depiction of Efap and it's in an older state.
Obviously, we're doing the modern version.
Chats there.
Pull the beams from.
Oh, that's good.
I like that one.
Pretty funny.
Waskely Wags.
Wags.
Stupid squeaky chair.
Fuck.
By the way, this is absolutely how real shotguns work.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
That's a fucking map strap reference.
I don't know what that means.
That's that.
That was OK.
There was a day of Minecraft YouTubers and this is like the one fucking.
Yeah, yes.
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy this is in here.
What does it mean?
Yeah.
The reference is that it's just like the sign saying fucking liar is the reference.
But oh.
That's it.
Yeah.
I'm disappointed.
Yeah.
You find again.
I want to see people.
I just I was surprised to see it.
All right.
To lose friends and alienate people.
Quinton reviews.
Molotiero.
ContraPoints rags.
Sex doll.
Bread 2.
PewDiePie.
Internet historian Jay Longbone.
Armored skeptic.
Turkey Tom.
Ben Shapiro.
Ben Shapiro.
I fucking hate everyone that's everyone's a Nazi.
I'm surprised they didn't do anything with the piglet.
I haven't seen that.
Who are his friends.
That's weird.
I look weirdest to talk about.
Yeah.
That it.
Who is like on Quinton's team exactly.
Who's like his buddy now.
I mean, Quinton's on there.
That's good enough for him.
I'm sure.
That's good enough.
Remember when you made the comment right about him seeming to like be blessing her with his staff.
He does.
He does.
He did look like that.
Yeah.
Always.
That's such a well chosen picture of Ray too.
Yep.
I'm so cold.
So cold.
What?
I like this.
A lot.
Sonic says if you're ever bored, punch an orphan.
What are they gonna do?
Tell their parents.
Thanks Sonic.
Sonic knows what's up.
You did it.
Hey.
That's it.
I'm so cold.
So cold.
I like this a lot.
Sonic says if you're ever bored, punch an orphan.
What are they gonna do?
Tell their parents.
Thanks Sonic.
Sonic knows what's up.
You did it.
Hey.
That's it.
Yet another accurate meme.
Oh Singapore.
Wild was better off with Taderis.
I see this as an absolute win.
Um Rags you've been spotted in a store.
Though you've put on some weight and you're wearing a little, uh, I'm sure they're called.
Is it like a shawl or a necktie thing?
It's not necktie.
Swapping out accessories.
Like a headscarf.
Yeah.
Provat.
Is that?
No.
So that's like, that's your word.
Somebody who can, someone who can speak that someone tell us what that means.
Cause I don't even know what language that is.
Cause I don't even know what language that is.
I'm going to assume Japanese or some, some Japanese font.
It's a kerchief.
Is that it?
Ascot?
Anchor chief.
An ass.
No.
Ascot or like around.
That's what Freddie wears.
Babushka.
Someone's saying I can vote twice.
So that's true.
Kerchief.
Neckerchief.
It could be just worn up top.
Yeah.
Someone said Japanese.
That's that's cool.
But what does it say?
All right.
Does anyone speak Asian?
The church of the toxic brood.
We've got James Moore, the Pope, the richest defabber of the toxic brood.
Got the creamy sheath Palpatine, the revered historian.
Beowyn, the skilled artist.
Both veteran verbal terrorists and newcomer hate mongers.
The kinds of deep themes that can, the mere words cannot.
Meme repository, the missionary.
His video is filled with Tism reaching far and wide telling the massive history of the toxic brood.
Oof oof, protector of orphans.
He definitely loves as much as his biological children.
Has low bode, has low bode density submits to the apex orphan.
Incapable of being gay, allegedly.
Doesn't own their own blood.
Got left behind.
Rather controversial revisionary.
They are the last controversial opposition.
Salad King rise.
Noble successor.
And Jared Genesis, the unfortunate traitor.
I think that fits.
I think that works.
I think that works.
This is beautiful.
This one.
Someone's caught someone saying it's called moon.
Runic.
If so, that's interesting.
Baby, it'd be okay for him to get killed.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
The geode wings.
Oh my goodness.
No.
John Luke is a national treasure.
I agree.
I agree.
100%.
I had the pirate hat.
This is getting weird now because the tabs don't actually have like,
I can't choose them myself.
I have to use the shortcut.
That's some good rat.
I love that.
So much Photoshop work gets done.
What is this?
I don't know the source like thing.
Hmm.
Thank knowing the source would help.
Who could be the alien Vader who has been tagged with like all the alien
things.
One of the best gifts I ever got was drugs.
I'm in danger.
Other use of my picture of you.
Everyone should watch if I'm giving for it was good shit.
Oh, it was funny.
I guess someone found this book jazz rags and blues.
Oh, by the way, um, I guess I, um, you could put this on stream.
Give me just a second here.
Um, when I saw that originally, I thought it was very,
very interesting that somebody had, um,
had brought that up because dude,
dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
Mm hmm.
That's pretty good.
It's not.
It's better than I can do.
Yeah, that's what I mean by it's not.
I think that's an absolute win win.
What's this?
Yeah.
Well, that's, that's my copy.
That's all you have a vision of that.
I do.
I actually, I actually have that book and I used it extensively when I was,
uh, uh, going through, when I was learning the piano.
That's why when I saw that meme, I had to do like a double take because I,
I know that cover so well.
You sure that they didn't rip that off your name from the future when they
made, I don't know.
I couldn't even say now the terminators went back in time to plant this into
our home.
Do you have a green carpet?
Huh?
You have a green carpet?
Not at my house.
It says my, my parents' house.
Oh.
That's where I grew up.
It's a, it's a, it's actually works.
It works with the room.
It's like a, like a dark green.
That's a pretty cool shit.
And then that's not how acronyms work.
No, but it's, you get what they're doing.
You get it.
It's cool.
Racist.
Um, yeah.
I think, you know,
we get it.
It's still good.
Oh, Jared.
Um, we have one of these before, but this is a different version of the long
man body pillow, I think.
Oh, and for the, for the Chask about Laura.
Yes.
I do know how to play piano.
Pretty good.
I like the long man.
This is another long man with you.
And this is another long man with me and there's you as well.
Whoa.
Thing.
That's like the Meowth thingy.
Yeah. Yeah.
So you said there's more than one of them.
Meowth being long as a thing.
And I'm okay with that.
I've summoned Meowth.
Oh my God.
Pretty much definitive proof that style was ripped off.
Um,
Part Sith Lord part,
all pussy ass.
He's got soup in his hand.
I'm a cop.
That is good.
Sorry, Kat.
Just loud soup is just a funny combination of words.
Not normally the adjective you use to describe soup.
This is another Efap gaming for inside me.
It was like one of my, one of my top five favorite memes.
Apparently in Borderlands you can come across badass Goliath.
Oh yeah.
So I think there must be some kind of clone or shrunken vision because Goliath
isn't that puny, you know?
Yeah.
It's kind of insulting, but you know, fair enough.
Yeah.
You simply named after the great Goliath.
One of the children.
Wagsies.
I'm hunting wags.
Hunting wags.
They've gone through all of the individual season things to replace
with wags.
Of course.
Yeah, you know, that's just, you know, that's it.
Another Efap gaming for reference.
It's getting my head dirty here.
The not so great debate part two.
2019 colorized.
It was an ordeal to say the least.
That was something else.
What makes it crap?
I like how he didn't even say that, but well, it didn't say that.
It's just the font was so tizzly.
What would you have us do?
I'm sorry.
It looks like a rat.
Millions.
It says showtism.
I mean, yeah, I'd watch it.
I don't know.
It's past for me.
You guys might be aware of this.
This meme got sent around.
Where it's well.
And they've just replaced it.
So people who don't know, it's just like, if a guy says that
Canterbury didn't serve a purpose, then they probably don't understand
a plot and theme work.
If they say that Holders plan was like just nonsense, all of it,
then they probably have a problem with men facing consequences
for their actions.
And then if they say, and I love the J's on you, the Rose Tico
character was useless and poorly acted.
They racist and probably hate women.
This thing got around.
Just imagine unironically thinking like that.
Yeah, that's what's so that's what's so weird.
There are people who unironically like Batwoman and who parrot
stuff like this around as if it's really a thing.
Like they believe it.
It's like, oh, you don't like Rose Tico?
Yeah, probably a racist who hates women.
You don't like a character in a movie and that's all that's all
they need.
They added a fifth panel.
Just a sad face like, oh, man, what is it wrong with me?
Oh, no, I'm going to have all of the flags.
So that's not actually the end of the meme images, but we're
getting close.
Oh, yeah, I know.
I'm actually like.
All right.
Next portion.
That was one of the portions.
Jeb and Angry Jew.
We had a lot.
We all we took.
Yeah.
Jenny's video got fucking ignored several times for just
better things.
Angry Joe and you know, that stuff.
Go with the job.
That's good.
That's good.
I mean, I can't say this meme is accurate, but I still
appreciate the effort.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now, Jeb is my best friend.
We have both.
I think Jeb and the dawn can work together.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now, Jeb is my.
Jeb is pretty awesome.
What a powerful tech team.
Lord of the Faps.
Return of the Alpha.
These are all specific, I guess, to the previous.
Yeah, probably yesterday.
Yeah.
Definitely this one.
Zack Snidey is the guardians of the cool.
I guess it would be done.
You're right.
Yeah.
That guy.
What was it?
What?
Yeah.
The demon bugle in that movie.
I forgot.
I didn't even.
I didn't even think about it.
But yeah, that's the name of the demon guy from that
one movie.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I haven't seen it actually.
So Sinister is the name of it.
Sinister.
Yeah.
I've heard of that.
That's the one with Ethan.
Ethan Hawke was in there.
I'm not sure.
He like lives in images and stuff like that.
And he eats children or something.
Oh, well, you know.
Sinister is the name of it.
I love this.
This is great.
Oh, no.
No.
This is a chance.
Wait, what is the little guy?
It's uncompetitive, I think.
Because he has an Xbox avatar.
Okay.
I like how accurate this is.
Well, that's from Trollhunter.
That's from Shrek.
That's from Shrek, not Trollhunter.
That's Ogrehunter, if anything.
Do the wrong.
This is a reference to Cyberpunk.
That's a reference to The Dawn.
True.
It's Trollhunter.
Dude, it's a crossover.
It's a reference to Trollhunter.
Why not a crosshunter?
Like we had two of these.
Come have bad takes with us.
They are very bad takes.
I can't believe that Jenny's was worse than Movie Box.
Yeah, it was just awful.
It's interesting how everything she said was wrong.
I think she gets away with a lot of really hated statements because of how the framing of all of it is.
To say it's just a girl sitting down talking about a movie she saw.
What's the wrong with that?
What are you criticising her for?
You're all talking about movies.
She got Jenny Nicholson.
Insert film here thinks it's more deep and profound than it actually is,
complete with pointless filler that doesn't add anything to the overall story.
Wolfmolar and West.
Oh my, this one looks interesting.
How many eFas have we gone without memes?
Smaller, about four.
Oh god, I can't read it.
It just says Beeb Overload.
It's super tiny as well.
Yeah, it's juicy.
I saw this the other day and it's much better quality.
Is it on the eFas on the Discord?
Maybe I, yeah, I must have copied it.
Did you actually grab the thumbnail or something?
Must have been, yeah.
But I mean, I still understand.
It's very good memes, I like it.
The trouble with memes is that they're no trouble at all.
That is a true.
Um.
What?
Don't get it.
It's a tank.
Oh, it's a tank.
Oh, what?
That's the way you could lift up a tank.
Oh god, it's back to back wartime style ones.
Everyone eFap goes live.
I'm not sure what's happening in this image.
Are you trying to say everyone goes fucking nuts?
They're racing to watch the eFaps.
The tank is no longer affected by gravity.
I'll sell that.
I've seen realistic.
Shot and killed 404.
Shot and wounded 1960.
Total shot 2364.
Total homicides 440.
Yeah, that's from the website that I was using for crime statistics yesterday.
You wouldn't get it.
Oh, Jeb.
Jeb.
This is a Futurama reference.
If anybody needs me, I'll be in the angry doll.
And I guess that's where eFap lives.
It's not untrue, I will say.
I don't like this one.
How many cinema Roberto memes?
Jenny memes?
Jeb memes.
I can't believe that's an actual picture of Jeb.
I know.
I wish I knew the context of why he was doing that.
Someone in chat will have it.
Yeah, if someone in chat knows, let me know.
This is an eMan gameplay one.
Don of war.
Yeah, boy.
That don looks like it was always there.
Good shit.
eFap 40k.
This would be the Smiler Al version of the 8-bit stuff.
Oh, there's ER.
Hmm?
I think that's ER.
No, no, Smiler Al.
ER is the different color scheme.
I don't think there is an ER one yet.
And look at this craziness.
Apparently, Borderlands is kind of a fan of eFap.
I don't know.
It's just a fresh rat.
Fresh rat.
They're clearly inching toward it, I can tell.
That seems like a trap.
Yeah, kind of.
That's neat.
I don't know.
I'm assuming this is something else's image of death.
Like, it was clogged with death.
But if you want to apply me to death,
I'm not going to say that's a big wrong, all right?
But it does suggest things that are interesting.
Oh, look at Jamie.
Nothing.
Got him.
Save.
Save.
Save.
I guess that's from him.
Oh, from his green.
Yeah.
His shitty Kylo Ren mug.
Celestial Epicry.
Epicary.
What have we got going on here?
Everyone's blue.
What is this?
Oh, so this is Bloodborne.
Bloodborne, yeah.
Thanos against.
Yeah, that's.
Oh, it was.
Oh, yeah.
Because he had a sword.
Like, it looked like.
Oh, wait a minute.
That's not even a fucking Bloodborne character.
No, no, no, it's not.
But it's the Bloodborne boss, the fungi man.
That meme is really good.
That took a lot of work.
This is the thing that exists.
Oh, no.
It's beautiful.
What we should definitely do is we should put it in a public place and make it a crime
to destroy it instead of throwing it right into the landfill.
Yes, that thing is gorgeous.
I love it.
Make it a crime to destroy it.
It is important that this is displayed on the stream.
No.
So J.
Don't explain what happened here.
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
Just replace the fucking collar with little rhinos.
Yep, yep.
It's the most to explain.
I look like him.
I have to accept this fact.
Like, I'm not.
I don't like it, but it's true.
So you admit you're related.
Yes.
My God.
I could be.
Did he have kids?
I don't know.
I don't know.
You turned Celtic against me.
You have done that yourself.
I don't think he's actually against him or anything, but I don't know.
It could be.
This is when I was referencing how people go so nuts with how it's a reference to a thing.
So it's okay.
But I said, what if two sumos just battled on top of a star destroyed?
They're like, there's a reference to see more wrestling wrestling.
That's that's another one.
They could be a surreal me.
I think there's three efap chats.
So much concern.
It's one eyes are so yellow.
Apparently she hasn't closed them in a long time.
That makes sense.
Totally.
We got someone watching efap with pizza.
Can't say that's a bad choice.
Good stuff.
Is that a is that a pineapple on that pizza?
It looks like it is.
I'm afraid.
Oh, no.
What a shit meme.
I look like this meme is like POV from the pizzas perspective.
You can see almost all the pizza.
Well, yeah, if you look down, you can see almost all the pizza taking a selfie.
Oh, the pizza taking a selfie.
Okay, I can get that.
Yeah.
Pizza taking a salt sort of, I guess.
Well, if we imagine that there's eyes at the top of the pizza and it's looking down, that's like mainly what it would say.
How do we wait?
How do we know we're not at this isn't from the bottom of the pizza looking up because the eyes aren't at the bottom fucking dipshit.
How do you tell me where the eyes are on a pizza?
Tell me where the fucking eyes are on the top of the pizza.
On the top of the circle.
The pizza.
That's a circle.
Yes.
Well, it's the top because that's where the eyes are.
You've upset him.
No, Jay.
No, no, no, no.
Hang on.
Hang on.
Just let's find.
Hang on.
This is a necklace drawing from for metal.
He's entered the memes.
Is that metal?
Yes.
I can see that.
I can see that.
It's a shame he doesn't have any eyes in his nose.
They're fucking massive.
I don't really know the context of this image, but it really shows where Pete's eyes are.
Oh, right.
What the fuck?
I mean, he's not wrong.
It does kind of show.
You get it up for chat.
I don't know if they're aware of this.
This is we're getting into the thing is contextually.
Nothing's wrong here.
If the pizza has been cooked in the oven, that's probably dead.
So the eyes would be eyes could be closed and they just would look like it's a creature.
That's what brings life.
Yeah.
I was going to say that's not how it works.
But by your logic, Jay, the pizza has like fucking 12 eyes or some shit, depending on
how much it's been cut.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no.
No.
Oh, well.
So someone wanted to tell us about some more good rat.
It's a Halloween rat loaf.
Halloween rat loaf.
Oh, my goodness.
Imagine being presented with this and how you'd be like, whoa.
That's you put some evidence of that.
Some real effort into making that look as appealing as possible.
Off that off that mousetrap.
Right.
Why?
That's what it is.
I think one of the flavor.
A real rat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Southpaw's rendition of critical drinker.
Lego form.
If you would do this for a known racist alt writer, reviewing movies, disgusting.
Man's more of a Nazi than Jay Hemler.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
Somebody in chat wrote Jim earlier.
Jim.
That one.
Taking one last look.
So at my mass.
That's that meme is more sad than the actual scene in the trailer.
To realize that neon cover was not fucking accurate.
Disgusting.
I'm a terrible host.
I apologize.
So there's a couple here of the 3D drawn ones.
Right.
So we're going to have to get a bit of you might have to click these ones
because some of them have video in them.
Right.
Oh, there's pictures you got.
This is wags.
I think burning a straw man.
There's the opinion holes.
Someone's raw.
And someone's throwing things off a roof.
It's got money and people.
Money and people.
How much like people to me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
There's people.
They're white.
So it's hard to spot them.
But there are little people.
It looks like.
Oh, yeah.
They are little people.
They got the opinion hold.
I guess people get thrown into his little efap.
Like what do you call them?
Of.
It's because raw super chats about throwing people off roofs.
You know, is this drawn in a tilt brush?
No idea.
But there looks like it's brought in tilt brush.
It's really good.
I love these 3D ones.
I'm a farmer for this meme.
Or am I?
Is that an axe?
I have.
There are a lot more of these.
But right now we've got this one.
I guess this is us in GMOS.
It's just Slender Man.
Crystal Bowl.
Future Bowl.
Yes, it was a future bowl.
But not the Great Debate 2.
It's obviously the movie poster when it gets released.
Like instead of Nike.
They're back for everyone who believes in objectivity.
Electric Boogaloo.
So Rags, want to do some reading?
I would love to do some reading.
All right.
So this is The Cosmic Chicken Part 1 written by Baguidious.
He says,
That's where I saw him.
The cosmic chicken himself.
I was confused and scared.
But then the chicken looked at me and I was suddenly not scared.
I was calm.
He then said,
I bid thee welcome, Baguidious.
He spread his wings.
I am known as the cosmic chicken.
I was stunned that he knew my name.
I was fascinated that the legends were true of a cosmic chicken.
He continued,
You are truly a massive and a great scholar, my boy.
I looked at him confused and I asked,
What is a massive?
He laughed and said,
My friend, you have much to learn.
So yeah, it's official.
This is only part one.
This is only part one.
Where I could go from here.
It's intense stuff.
Yeah.
So I appreciate the meme,
but I mean,
I'm totally on board with complaining about matriculations.
I say it in my episode three review.
But what about the matriculation?
I would never throw him out the window for that.
Rawwood.
Yeah.
Maybe this is raw wearing my mask.
Who knows?
I don't know what this is from,
but it says happy wags on it,
which is good enough.
Happy wags.
Happy wags.
Oh, is this like a diary of a kid stuff?
Possibly.
I don't know.
I haven't seen that.
I think that is.
Happy wags.
I've been boarding.
I haven't been boarding in a while.
So sorry about that.
This is like me,
but as I'm willing to let people guess what this is a mashup of,
because I'm not entirely sure.
I'm assuming an animu.
It looks like code vein.
Oh, it could be.
With the whole neck thing that goes over.
It could be like the gas mask thingy.
But fair enough.
I assume this is created in relation to eFap,
but I don't actually know.
It could not be.
Also, opinion hold.
A good old logo for it.
The official eFap rig.
It's another gaming for reference.
This is apparently for.
Remarkable Republicans video.
Bisexualism.
Oh my God.
Arthur Fleck is a bisexual and this plays a major role in his breakdown.
Arthur's relationship with his mother has some Oedipal qualities.
That means I guess in chat,
Oedipal is the guy who kills his dad and marries and fucks his mom.
It's considered Oedipal's complex, right?
Yes.
It's actually Freud, I think, who is Freudian.
Freudian, of course, of course.
The idea is that we look for,
like when a man looks for a woman,
he wants qualities that he sees.
And his mother, that sort of thing.
Let's see.
He he his imagined romance with his neighbor is an homage to how Brad Pitt
imagined Edward Norton by his side.
And the minimal intimacy between the couple shows Arthur's conflicted emotions.
It's not that backwards.
If he's talking about Fight Club.
Also, I don't know what that has to do with him being bisexual.
No, because it's a good thing.
Yeah, nothing to do with being bisexual.
Next bullet.
Arthur clearly has an attraction to Thomas Wayne and Marie Franklin.
He expresses his attraction in very strange ways.
Yeah, very strange.
And last bullet point.
This conflict of his sexuality and rejection by all four of this romance,
of his romantic interests, turned Arthur into the Joker.
And that's what he said.
Four of this romance of his romantic interests turned Arthur into the Joker.
Don't know what that has to do.
We should visit one of these videos again.
No, just come off.
That's for insanity.
Oh, yes, we can.
The last one is pretty good.
I like this one, considering what we just read.
Oh, I remember that.
Yeah, yeah.
The Joker is a film about how Arthur struggles with mental illness.
He's shaped by the circumstances of society he lives in.
That leads Arthur to become the Joker.
No, no, let's have our own narrative.
We've got another scammy idea, you.
Oh, God.
Yes.
If these memes haven't made you want to go see Efap Gaming 4, chat,
you've got to do it.
Perfect.
Just do it.
Oh, my God.
Subversive chieftain.
Oh, no, not not Yerksky, the subversive chieftain.
He's dangerous.
Not Yerksky.
It's from Meme Repository.
I saw this one.
It's beautiful.
I'd like to point out.
I like this chat and this this chat comment.
I used to think Remarkable Republican was a tragedy.
Now I see it as a comedy.
Yeah, this is Jay.
He got his video, Total Party.
He did not resort to character assassination and insults to defend himself
and admitted some mistakes while still feeling free to disagree
and ask questions.
Joe, Jay chose to make friends, improve his content.
You can say Jew.
Angry Jew instead of being the big gay.
Feel like Jay, Geode.
What a nice story.
You need a Geode in your image there.
Jay is an S plus tier meme.
It's true.
I like this.
Even though it's not like I think that the other seasons are amazing
or something, but seven seasons were gifted to the race of men who,
above all else, desire quality.
But another season was made.
Oh.
Also, again, I guess you were right about Fortnite.
I'm in Fortnite as well.
There you are.
There you go.
You have three fingers.
I'll get over it.
More than enough?
Yeah, you can grab something.
Oh, no, you're like, you're like Dale.
I'm like Dale.
So we got a lot here.
Efap Mitty reacting to Batwoman.
We got, I guess I've got the Welsh flag on me.
Batwoman's got the Isle of Man.
And I got the Bat Cleaver.
Bat Cleaver.
And she's saying, I'm a woman.
She's got the kicky legs on her chest.
The giddiest in the bottom left there.
Yeah.
And I'm not there.
Hooray.
Oh, yeah.
You can't actually see the bat cleavers.
Probably fell off the roof.
The wrath, are you off it?
I was I was said this.
It's it's nicely cut.
I'm entirely sure of what's happening here.
I'm Dr. Doom giving children ice cream.
Why?
I don't know why.
But it's important.
Who's that guy in the back?
Oh, ice cream man, I guess.
Oh, it's just part of that.
Yeah, I guess that's just part of the picture.
I was wondering.
Oh, God.
I am inevitable.
Episode died.
I have bullet.
All right.
We will be covering it.
It's going to happen.
We're currently living in a pre episode nine world.
You realize that won't exist for very long.
We're almost out of that.
Live it up.
Yeah.
I'm going to be in Washington state on the 20th.
I should see if I could at least still see the movie while jet lagged.
This is harassment.
Sexual harassment.
Release raw.
Here comes the roof.
I think he throws it before this point.
Again, an episode for me as gaming episode for me.
This is not.
Oh, rags.
You have a lift.
Tresnik dictionary.
Tresnik.
Most trusted.
Years ahead of its time, better than my mother and bad Freudian.
Happy, adjective, sad.
Then.
I'm glad we got this.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure?
Are you sure about that?
All right.
That actually might be it for images.
No, sorry.
Well, me.
No, no.
About 50 more came in in the last hour.
One more portion.
No promises on how long they're going to be.
But yes, this is me.
Miss worth one quarter portion.
This has been added to my discord as a emote.
And I love it when it's used.
Is this.
Yes.
As the mode.
It's very important and relevant.
Are you sure about that?
Someone created me in what I assume is like blender or one of the other 3D
modeling things.
Terrifying.
Say the least.
Damn.
Wonderful.
It's like an alien.
It looks like something you'll find an uncharted like a little artifact.
Yeah.
It looks like that woman pre hair.
What's the key to unlock your nose?
I want to make everyone aware because some people might not see it.
But this was.
Amy trying to draw a guy dancing in.
A guy dancing.
What in 1940s Germany.
That's fantastic.
Here I want to read this out.
It's only small.
I think you'll like it.
Let's see.
Yo.
What are themes?
They're nothing but memes.
That's what mauler deems.
So drop these schemes and listen to my streams.
And I even have a little dab.
Dab on.
So.
So you know how.
The batarangs are calibrated for Bruce's long arms.
They're not funny to me.
At this point I'm ready to believe that Luke's fetish is.
Getting assaulted by women.
I'm a woman.
Such.
Great.
This is a movie that's coming out soon.
I can't wait to see it.
Massive productions and if up in association with a discord far away
presents a film by a fellow massive long man mauler rags.
That's actually that's actually creepy.
Yes.
Genuinely really creepy.
It's actually genuinely pretty creepy.
I want to see this movie.
Oh man.
I'm no I'm too spooky.
It's coming out on TV video to me.
Oh no.
I don't want that in my house.
It's too spoopy.
Oh no.
Massive productions and if up in association with it is called far
away presents a film by a fellow massive long man.
No.
Yes.
I have the tiredness.
You do.
And yes, this is a rendition of spiders seeing into the future.
Is that a little fun?
This one's one from a guy who draws scary drawings.
Wait, do we cover this one?
I'm starting to think that this seems familiar or did we not?
This is no replies.
I don't know if I can do this Alex.
Just think of something dope to say.
Okay.
Hey.
It's a baby wavy.
You ever get a guy?
Hey wavy.
Oh yeah.
I'm pretty sure we've looked at this.
You ever be the guy that blocked someone on Twitter for a meme?
Get away from me you weirdo.
You're a quack.
Because he blocked some.
Yeah, he blocked rags because he shared a meme.
So me and Mel were playing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Someone shared a meme about me.
He shared one of my memes.
It wasn't even me.
Yeah, I know.
So we made a joke about her crap.
A lot of like telltale slash until dawn, the supermassive games things.
Yeah.
Like you take a drink of water.
It'll be like the ocean will remember.
You killed me.
You consumed me.
I think this is when rags has been given Daenerys's story.
And he was like.
Imagining being with Khal Drogo.
Maybe I'm not sure.
He's a handsome one.
He is handsome.
Just what went through my mind.
You know my mind well.
Imagine being young woman.
What does that say to the left?
Someone actually drew that.
You're still a guest.
They did.
They drew me sleeping.
Ground a pickle.
Ground a pickle.
Ground a pickle.
Yeah, that's good shit.
You're still objectively a guest.
I think rags is happy about that.
Yeah, I think so.
I'm fine with being a guest.
The moral arithmetic of Biggittias morality is measured in the base unit of murdered
civilian MC.
A bad act is positive MC negative units.
A good act is negative MC units.
As long as the person's total MC score comes out of zero or lower the world is better
off for them.
So killing into self-defense.
So it's like for a singular unit of murdered civilian.
So freeing a slave is equal to one murdered civilian.
Makes sense.
Petting a dog is equal to 0.01 murdered civilians.
You got to pet a hundred people to kill someone, but you've had a hundred dogs.
Then there you go.
Crafting memetics.
That's 18 murder civilians.
Being an orphan for murder civilians, naturally.
Burning down a major city depends on who's judging, obviously.
Touching a woman's map, eight murdered civilians.
Oh, no, not a map.
The thing that Biggittias was way ahead of his time.
What can I say?
He was a smart man.
The man had some ideas.
Biggittias, he had some big ideas, you know.
He did.
He did.
This is a wonderful rendition of The Dawn and Joker hanging out.
Putting on a happy face.
Wonderful little rainbow in the background as well.
Yay.
This is more from Mr. 3D Man.
I guess this is me and Rags battling with several Jedi of some kind.
Terrifying, like I said, but accurate.
Yeah.
I like how Rags has like Wolverine clothes and then I've got like...
Yeah, because I'm fucking amazing.
I guess.
This is a cool piece of dialogue.
So the idea with this is to take fonts from...
Like metal bands.
The hate mongers of the toxic brood are objectively good, in my opinion.
It's awesome.
That's good.
You can get them framed.
The toxic brood can be a metal band.
Oh, yeah.
I like the spiders too.
This is for me.
This is obviously commentary on the fact that dentists know their shit.
And when it comes to Game of Thrones, I imagine.
Again, Ephab Gaming 4.
I really like this one though.
Father Fortier.
Going across to the alien.
I like the concerned battle ball phase.
I got hacked.
I got hacked.
Rags alien is outside.
Rags, were you ever the alien?
I was never the alien.
Yeah.
Never the alien.
Not a single time.
I like that you still got your shades on now.
Of course.
They never leave you.
I got hacked.
I'm sure.
I don't know how this was constructed, but it's adorable.
I guess a Rags pillow.
On my...
Oh my god.
Seat made of Isle of Man flags maybe.
Yeah, I think it was the alien three times when we were playing this.
Yeah.
I got Church of the Dawn.
I believe this is Father Fortier practicing the Church of the Dawn.
Very good.
As he should.
As he should, yeah.
He knows this stuff.
Very holy.
This one is...
This is one of the early ones for your street battle.
I think from the same guy.
Oh yeah.
It was actually...
What was the reference?
Yeah, it was referenced in Tarzan's Falls, wasn't it?
Because of the lighthouse.
Yeah.
Mola Productions.
I saw that now.
Ronald Sludge Village.
All the Sludge memes.
Oh yeah.
So this...
This one's a whole album as well.
You got Guestless Hold On.
Good, Bad...
Good, Bad End Rats.
Some Lizard.
What the fuck Rags is this?
Psych it out.
The Isle of Man flag is just chilling out.
There's Aiden.
Several Rats.
Oh, there's...
Grimace.
Oh, whatever was Grimace.
Have you even got the Dolphin of the Whale fighting in space?
I remember talking about that, but there's so much.
The Spider has Thor's Hammer.
Have you even got a section for Super Chats?
Where it's just like a fucking pile.
Wow.
A section for Super Chats.
And it's like me just presenting it, I think.
So it would have taken a while to do.
Yeah.
I'm curious how it works, like how you draw in 3D.
Well, like once you put the helmet on, everything has depth and it's way easier than you think.
There's more as seen by others, so...
Well, I mean, it's not as easy to, like, you know, be an artist.
Like, you know, drawing in 3D space, yeah, absolutely.
Like, it's just right back in your forehead.
Oh, wait.
Wait, click it. This is a lot more.
I did click it.
Oh, okay.
Through bosses eyes.
We're all drinking.
Through the Bay Bays.
Yeah.
They're all like very Efap episode specific, like they all apply to one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That alien game, that brought out a lot of memes.
I don't think I would have been able to call that.
Yeah.
Played that four times.
I love this.
Five, I think.
I love this.
Me and Mel streamed Man of Medan, or Man of... fucking don't care.
The way it worked was the way you make, like, you can just play on your own or you can have, you know, multiple people on the same PC, just hot seat it sort of thing.
And we chose that option, then it was like, okay, so name your individual people.
Now, every time you typed anything, once the letter goes in, it pulls you back out of, like, in the same way that, you know, you have to, like, click, like, Discord to type a message and then click out of it to carry on with whatever.
Whatever you're doing, you have to click back in.
So every time you type a letter, you have to do it again.
If you type E, it would, like, if you weren't already into the thing, it would, like, delete the profile and send you back to the beginning.
Yeah.
And it would, like, whenever you first click, it highlights everything you've done.
So if you type anything after that, you delete all of it.
Oh.
It was the most fucking infuriating system I've ever had to type a name with, and I just love this meme.
Probably took, like, 10 minutes to just put in the names.
I like the happy ghost in the background as well.
Yeah.
The Dark Souls of Values, yes.
We had alcohol to help us get through it.
Yeah.
Madame Madone was fucking terrible, by the way.
So bad.
Holy shit.
Oh, that was really terrible?
Really bad.
We were also done rolling.
I would recommend Until Dawn 10 times over before that game.
Yeah, interesting.
I don't know what the hell they were doing.
Like, I don't know how...
Just watch the stream.
It's only, like, four hours.
Yeah, I haven't seen the stream yet.
I mean, we had fun, obviously, but the game itself is, like, oof.
I like how simple this one is.
I love Jay.
I love Kick Jay.
Oh, beautiful.
And then as a follow-up...
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, that is scary.
Imagine that running at you.
I imagine if, like, Ifat was a cult, that would be the tattoo that all of them had.
By the way, I like the Dark Souls of Minus thing that's on it.
Yeah.
This is me battling the Isle of Man flag, I suppose.
Oh, you win.
We got a lot of mileage out of this Isle of Man.
Oh, my goodness, that flag.
Yeah, this is all from the same guy.
Any of these 3D ones, yeah, I think it's all from the same guy.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, this guy's a tilt brush enthusiast.
I kind of love it.
This is fucking hilarious.
Fly, you fuck!
Good.
Yeah, Ra is slowly becoming literally the Sun God depiction as well.
That is what Ra means.
Well, that's what I'm saying is that it's coming along.
That was like my initial intention.
I was just thinking about Smite when I said it because I think...
It's Smite and the Mummy, that's how I know about Ra.
This was made because, for some reason, you can't have a community without them wanting to ship stuff.
That I make hour-long videos so that I'm extremely concise and precise about what I'm talking about.
And then I'm curating. I'm like, we should hang out more.
I get the same criticism when I'm trying to actually be precise.
I can push that up a little bit.
I like that it's all in harass, that's it.
Yes, that team is cool.
This is like a cool...
I don't know what the team is, but like a... What was it, Jay? You said you studied it.
Photo manipulation?
I didn't say I studied it, I said I did it while I studied it.
You said you got a degree in it.
I dropped out in first year, I would never have said I got a degree in it.
You currently have a career in it.
You said you invented it.
You said you were born in it.
You're molded by it.
You've got Darth Vader's respirator there.
I do, with a skull, red eyes, got the monster truck wheelies.
Even Ephab's up there.
Some cool shit, looks awesome.
Yeah.
Next up, there's a couple of Pikachu ones that I've got to make sure we actually saw, as in the artist Pikachu.
I think this one was like... I don't know how I found it, but I liked it.
Slick the tazmi eyes.
Then...
Another interesting drawing.
I guess it's Dale.
And he's got like a shad symbol on his...
It was massive cancer, but now he's got a chad.
What is Rah here, like an alien?
Oh, he's one of the hillbillies from Squidbillies, yeah, Squidbillies.
You just got Belch for Rags.
Okay, it was massive cancer.
I like the Squidbillies thing.
Drawings are cool, are they not?
Oh, look at that.
It's oars.
Wags. Wolf. I like that. That's really cool.
I wonder if I hate everything's friend is aware of how much we've said wags thanks to him.
Oh, I don't know if you've seen this, Jay, but I'm assuming...
Did I show you it before? I can't remember anymore.
I've not seen this.
Well then.
This is Geode.
Geode? The art's actually really good.
Well, yeah, I guess it's like reference to a Steven Universe, but...
Maybe.
It is.
Once you saw anime for Steven Universe, you can make this character, Jay.
Really?
This is me doing my stream with Luigi's Mansion, and someone created some art.
Oh.
25-year-old long man.
Happy birth, Moolah.
This one's Stradomire.
Oh, Stradomire.
I didn't notice it first, probably because it's made in paint or something.
Yeah, it's not quite like it otherwise.
25-year-old long man.
I like the Luigi-Moolah crossover.
I like how the nose thing is the keyhole.
It's like a keyhole.
I like that.
Ew.
Are you squeezing the shit out of me?
I don't understand how this happened.
What?
Why is any of this?
I don't know.
I do not want that pizza.
Is it bad that the part of this that baffles me the most is that it's...
It's a road?
It's a road.
You cut out as well.
It's a concrete shit pizza.
It is a concrete shit pizza.
There is context for this, and we may never know what it is.
I like this.
It's a good shit.
You're working out the face.
That's a bias camera.
Efap gave me four, lots of beeps.
Yeah.
Speaking of which, one of the top fucking beeps.
That shirt was great.
There's no way when you drew that you would have thought...
Yeah, this is gonna become one of the...
This is gonna become...
This is memeage right here.
That was Fortilla's drawing, apparently.
Yeah, Fortilla drew that.
Yeah.
Well, this is I Love You Bods.
Humans.
Humans.
I just got hacked.
What the fuck?
Rags, I think you've seen this before, but it's still awesome.
I have.
Yeah, this is a great one.
Tism.
Tism.
The gun on the top of this.
You've got a gun-like weapon right there.
A gun-like weapon.
Staff is a gun-like weapon.
Oh, this is really good.
I really, really like this.
It's so awesome.
The Tism Wizard.
Tism Wizard.
I'd love to make the Tism Wizard.
It feels like you should be in some kind of game or show.
It's an important character that helps people progress.
Again, back to the scanning.
It's a Nekos drawing.
I can't believe this is a Tism Wizard.
Yeah, I dare you.
I think for those who haven't seen it, they're probably like,
what is the meme?
I keep saying I was...
You gotta keep up with the lore.
Yeah.
Yeah, what the fuck?
You missed one stream and you're gonna be out of the loop, man.
I ain't buying it.
You know, the Rhino dollars.
In Don we trust, it says.
The neat rendition.
There's so much I love about this.
So cool.
Super Chad's like, why are we good?
Oh, that's great.
I love that.
That's really cute.
Everyone's just great.
All Aiden's sleeping.
All Aiden's asleep.
Really, Jay is even there with his Rhino milk of course.
This is, I guess, me as the Joker running from movie pop.
Escape the better narrative.
That's great.
Escape from the better narrative.
I love how angry he looks.
You come right here.
Oh, look at the bells.
It probably says meta on it.
You can just barely see the E and the TA.
Oh, yeah.
Good shit.
I think we can all appreciate this meme.
You're always better off for Daenerys.
Yeah, what if he was one of the people that...
I'm sure he'd still agree.
It was better off.
She freed slaves, dude.
Yeah, man.
We live in a meta narrative.
I think it's this Pikachu's referencing taxon here, like in the also reality.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think so because he uses that.
I guess he uses that little doggy picture on like Twitter or something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
But he's like a psychotic, vindictive, evil, stupid dog.
Pretty much.
Got a little bit to go with the development.
I think it suits him so well.
He's a yappy little dog that isn't useful in any way.
Just makes noise and is annoying.
Yeah, that's him.
Yeah, that's him.
That's like a follow up image.
I think running mascara.
Hmm.
Yes.
Adorable drawings.
It's funny how like we're actually starting to spread out into several known artists
among the Pikachu.
Pikachu, yeah.
Pikachu and Ecos, Beowyn obviously, and I guess the 3D artists.
There's all these different like reoccurring ones.
The guy who makes the terrifying ones like this.
I like the eyes, like the eyeshadow.
Yeah.
Underneath it.
The creepy thing.
I really like that.
That crazy ex-girlfriend sort of thing.
That's Eric Texan.
Yes.
And wonderful wolf as well.
I can't remember when this was made or what the reference is, but he's got the pizza.
I'm not sure.
He's got his pizza, though.
And I already say these Pikachu ones are very good.
Oh, yeah.
Starting to get lots of images to save, kind of back up at home.
Oh, wait, have you seen this one yet, right?
I don't remember if I showed this.
I think I...
Hello.
Hello, I'm wack.
Oh, yeah.
I guess this is sort of me looking, reacting to the wolf, what I think.
Continuity.
Yeah, there's also versions.
Cuteness overload.
Oh.
I'm dying of cuteness.
Yeah, they're all super cute drawings.
They are very cute.
They're bubbly and...
And then...
My soft line is very rounded.
To completely swap genres of drawing.
Check this one out.
This is a, I think, high quality.
Well, like a high resolution one, so it might take some time.
I want to click it.
Yeah, this one's really good.
Ah, yes.
I'm checking out Chat's reaction.
Oh, God.
Nice, cool.
He's got rhino milk 100% on his wrist.
Oh, hey, that's nifty.
Yeah.
That, that's really nifty.
The saver's lighting as well.
Sorry, just looking at it for a bit.
Is that such a problem, you know?
Just appreciate it.
Spacey background.
Shut the fuck up, I'm looking!
Yeah.
It's good shit.
Mortal has a stick-like weapon.
This is another one.
I think this way I slipped through the cracks.
Like, I was giving it a while ago and I never put it on screen.
I don't think so anyway, but...
Observe mortals, as I say the M-Wid.
It's certainly a Halloween suitable and it's got eFap on the belt, I think, as well.
The pumpkin is really cool.
Yeah.
Oh, and yes, this one...
A couple people were very happy once this was created.
Yes!
Ultimate showdown.
Man, that Isle of Man flag, because it doesn't have to keep rolling to stay steady.
You can do it on one foot, right?
You know, he's got a lot of balance to him.
But who's to say this isn't a still frame of him charging towards me?
I think he's charging at this.
Oh, everyone's going...
Who knows where he's going?
It's a JoJo reference.
And none of us know that, because we're not weebs.
I'm so disappointed.
I don't know.
I know enough to know it's a JoJo thing, but I don't know anything about the memes themselves, no.
Oh, I guess we've got to watch that show.
I guess.
We're out on the memes.
So, Rags, have you seen this one?
Me and Mel have.
Yeah, I have.
I love this one so much.
This one is so great.
This one's really good.
Good rat.
Intense.
Good rat.
We are Aiden riding Goliath with me and Rags with her.
The dawn is carrying an orphan while also carrying metal up the mountain as we reach the good rat.
Yeah.
Metal looks very medley.
I guess that makes sense.
That looks like it really fits his avatar.
Well, I was going to say, you can see him right next to each other.
Those big eyes.
Those big eyes and the lips.
The lips, yeah, the nose.
Headphones.
The eyes are really...
The pepe eyes are really good.
It's the sad lips.
But if there was...
If there was a...
I could make like an eFap gallery.
These would be one of the ones that would just be like a framed portrait.
There's been a shit ton of them, though.
And yeah, actually that symbolizes...
Signifies the end of the images.
Really?
Yeah.
We made it.
That only took like...
How long was that?
Too long?
We are three hours in now.
Well, we started with the meme rankings.
No, no, no.
But how long have we been looking at images?
Oh, a hundred.
Hundreds.
For some reason, I looked at it right when we started with the tears.
And it was 100 minutes.
And then we started with the images.
Oh.
Well, I was going to say I can get it down to literally the minute because I just have
to look at the first one I posted to you guys, right?
I got a lot of scrolling to do.
But yeah, those are all collected.
And I imagine that I'll probably be doing more collecting now as we go forward with eFaps.
But you can see they pile up.
They pile up.
They do pile up.
Pile up.
That was an hour and 50 minutes.
Neat.
Of just images.
Just...
So how many videos are there?
Oh, you know.
Like a million.
Two or three?
All of them.
All of them.
All of them.
We get like it with copyright probably, but that's okay.
Can we get ready here?
Oh, yeah, of course.
I have to give you guys the invite.
Invitation.
Invitation.
Invitation.
Oh, have people been tweeting stuff to me?
Oh.
Oh, no.
More images.
Did you see the eFap movie one, which is apparently already...
eFap the movie part one.
17 minutes.
Did we watch...
Oh.
That's like the Halo Mass Effect mashup one, right?
I think so, yes.
Oh, we've got to look at...
Movie Bob's made a Dark Fate review.
I'll have to watch that.
I watched...
Critical.
I watched his review of Dark Fate.
It's not very good.
He says a lot of wrong-think things.
I had a lot of people in my comment section say,
yeah, but you're wrong because Critical said it was good.
I'm like, okay.
Oh, God, no.
He doesn't even really make arguments, though.
What's his best argument?
It's a lot of vague stuff.
Like, unfortunately...
So I'm thinking about the kind of thing that you get is...
I don't know.
The film has great action.
The plot has some stupid in it, but not loads of stupid.
That sort of stuff.
It's something in my penis.
The plot is all stupid.
If we have a specific eFap for covering anything to do with Dark Fate,
I'll probably throw it in.
It's not a fleshy video, because a lot of the stuff he says is the kind of thing
where we can't do anything about it, like I said with ones that are like...
We said about some of the stuff Jenny was saying.
We've come across it before.
I'm trying to think of a specific person.
Where they say stuff, we can't necessarily...
Like, if you just go, oh, it was boring.
It was this.
It was this.
It was this.
We're just like, okay, okay, okay.
But some stuff he says are easy for conversation starters.
I think he'll reconsider his perspective on the film.
Maybe, eventually.
Also, I'm collecting extra memes.
That's why I was a little bit distracted.
Well, we're going to continue on with video memes.
But that doesn't mean we won't check some of these picture ones out at the end.
I'm still collecting them.
Yeah, because I got the HD versions of those other ones.
They got blurred in transit, you see.
That's the internet for you, blurring things.
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
I think this has proven that we really are long podcasts.
All we did was look at pictures and went at three, eighty-four hours.
It's funny that I'm talking about this while getting a meme prepared about how there's too many memes.
Hmm.
I'm in danger of falling asleep at this point.
Well, I mean, you made it and lost the pictures.
So I imagine the videos will probably wake you up a bit.
Like, you know how you woke up very late?
Yes.
So, like, I'm energized and I could probably go for a while.
You're the reverse of that, aren't you?
I'm exactly the reverse of that.
I knew it.
I've been waking up so late that I've been waking up early.
All right.
So our first one is Efap meme Captain Marvel meets Goliath.
And I think...
I want to say this might be League of Legends.
Oh, no.
This noise is freaking me the fuck out.
What?
I didn't realize those noises were coming from my headphones.
Oh.
Hmm.
For a thousand years.
Bound beneath these waves.
I have watched you.
I have...
Is this Goliath?
Yeah, she meets Goliath.
She's got to be Goliath.
Oh, it's World of Warcraft at the time.
You.
How's the John?
It won't be long now.
Long now.
Your death is near.
Oh, no.
Only I can sustain you.
What is happening?
I don't know.
I haven't seen this game.
He sees her reflection in his eyes, I guess.
Maybe.
Oh, sorry.
Serve me.
You.
You are nothing.
Nothing.
I am a god.
Oh, shit.
Me.
Before you walk this way.
Oh, that's got to be Goliath at that point.
Oh, yeah.
I need you.
I'm magnificent.
Serve me.
Not the tentacles.
Something you need about a horrible tentacle monster assaulting Egypt, or something similar.
I want to see that movie.
It's not Egypt.
It's a lady.
Did you say this was Warcraft?
It's not Egypt.
It's a lady.
Her name could be Egypt.
You have some weird names out there.
Her name could be Egypt.
And, yes, apparently this is World of Warcraft.
Cool.
Pretty cool cutscene.
Yeah.
No.
You.
You.
You.
You.
Not a slave.
Give us the fuck that tentacle monster.
I don't know that Goliath would agree to...
Oh.
... Date Bree Lawson.
I don't know.
I'm just saying.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
She's helping.
Apparently it's a mortal elf bargaining with an old god for more power.
Which old god?
Okay.
And you will remain here?
a prisoner the god of nothing I want to find out what that cutscene actually is
apparently it's world of warcraft can't find it we're just setting a world of
warcraft look at new world of warcraft cutscenes you'll probably find something
and also we are only mortal elf old god you'll find something yeah D&D amasses
after all game of thrones show with 300 characters in costume having sex that's
all you really need to know your show that makes me feel dumb you know we're
also the show that makes us feel dumb we screened the initial pilot for three of
our friends all writers all smart got to the end and there was just dead silence
in the room and one of our friends shakes his head and says you guys have
a massive problem you certainly didn't want to say massive when you were
embarking on this was such a massive undertale throw that weird around like
that just like that it's kind of fucking probably watch this maybe between that
and in your friend saying it was massive I can't believe it like well yeah
we say it but in context so is okay but they just just throwing it out the
casual disgusting really so here's seen the boys me me me me there's a really
quick meme it'll be funnier if you've seen the boys copyright infringement is
costing bought one point two oh man that got me usually a couple of small
video memes but still popping it in

their face because their faces all fucked up from being injured but because
she's so sad about being like oh no no one likes me anymore she says hey

she's like yes all of the all of the things you just said yes so she's she's
sitting in her house like la la la and then one day is this the plot of the
film you want me to see no this is the history the law if you will of the film
it doesn't spoil whatsoever this is this informs the rest of the film which I
will do movies just to see what you guys think no let's do it now we'll do
it after the stream 100% okay I'm not gonna fall asleep whatsoever let's do it
now now wide awake so you wake me up so one day she's old people she's chillin
she's knitting whatever you do and she has a knock at the door she's like oh
my goodness and she opens the door and there's these these angry parents and
sometimes people like hey motherfucker what'd you do without kids she's like
wait what it turns out two kids a Hansel and Gretel if you will went to see her
with the intention of trading that their children teeth that fell out during the
night for coins they've disappeared they've disappeared she killed them
obviously what else could have happened they've disappeared and so they they
put her on a stake they're like this is 100% she's killed them 100% there's
nothing else that could have happened put on a stake they rip off her porcelain
mask by the way his skin very sensitive to the sunlight and she's in pain she's
like oh my goodness I wear this because it protects my fragile skin from the
Sun and as they set her alight they put it to flame they're like hey motherfucker
you deserve this and she's like you know what town you know gay town every one of
them in fact every time a child loses their last tooth in this town I will
come to collect it and if they look at me if they look upon my disfigured face
I will fucking kill them you understand all right good that's very specific in
the moment while you're being confused yes but it's spooky nonetheless and so
she dies and she's burned and she's dead and she's all kinds of yes it's horrible
she's ashes all of the ashes and the townspeople they're horrified they learn
that the children got lost in the forest they're not dead they're just like oh hey
we're here hi I'm sorry we took a long we're wrong turn the path was there and
you know fuck it we guys didn't do anything stupid we were gone right no
oh my goodness fuck it we we saw a bread trail it led us to a candy house and we
ate the candy house and you guys know we just didn't go the right way and so the
townspeople like oh my goodness we we killed a woman for no reason damn and
then fast-forward to the opening set of scenes of the movie and there's a child
a young boy who's lost his last child's tooth and he puts it under his pillow
because that's what we all do when we're younger and we're like hey mom dad give
me some money so I can buy some some stuff and for the money and creepy things
happen and then and that's I've led you into literally the opening five minutes
of the movie so that's yeah that's it that's it Halloween is literally the
coolest time of year that was really good shit yeah I really like that that
was really great we still have to see that movie though we do I watched it
with Mel while he was over Mel what do you think of it oh wow it's pretty good
yeah some some weird tisms with the rules but it's fine this is a quick one
I guess everywhere I go
oh that's great I was hacked oh man um and hilarious
that's funny Chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about pores he eats them he grills
them he grills them twice
dogs and flavors
Oh
Wolf's pizza good rat cosmic chicken
Hungry that's really good. I like that
This is called efap in a nutshell
It's king of the monsters, I mean I'm gonna have to do some pausing. Otherwise we could actually go down stream wise
Oh
Hey the the flash of lightning actually flashed onto their faces you see that
Yeah
I'm looking forward to when our efap releases for this as well. I have to give it some time folks. It's 17 we have on the waiting
Oh
So who's gonna be Godzilla at this I wonder I don't think it'll be Goliath no, it'll be
the dawn
Oh
She screamed at that creature by the way
She did a very good job
Seems well, there's more tonal to gases in chat
The entirety I guess thematically that makes more sense it does and it's important to nail those themes people
Oh
Also, yeah, like I realized that by the way the with the amount of work
I've been doing stupid efap movies edits. It's as low as seven seconds
I've never seen it go lower than that, but that's video clip limit. It seems to be I used to say ten
seven
Yeah, we have to pause the shit out of this
I see jazz not great. I
Mean what's wrong with it the legs? I don't know it just looks not good. I'm ahead of you
I don't know about the legs. I'm ahead
Yeah
Oh
Man imagine tackling movie ball Patrick Willems and Quinton if they did like a collab video
Yeah, just gonna make sure I'm pausing this is just all I need to do is make sure the stream doesn't go down
That's the main goal here
You
Who owns Godzilla as long as it's not zephyr we should be okay. No one owns him. He's king of monsters. That's true. Yeah
You know him running at that speed man with how big he is
You can't you can't you can't bring up how big Godzilla wait you fuck up him or for no
Well, the whole city is just gonna get fucked with some yeah
Yeah
Then he finishes off with the radiation meltdown
Yeah, I was gonna say he like nukes Boston at the end of the film, but they treated us. Oh, it's just like this. That's fine
We're good we'll come back tomorrow we're rebuilt no issues the buildings are melting because of the radiation, yep
If you remember
Jay and Mel will both know about this one. So
Talking about how if Ani was an actual dad in like a family life the t-800 then surely at one point
He would like break stuff. For example a toilet. You probably break
Yeah
Oh
Maybe so bad
But I've heard a lot of people like it so what do I know? Mm-hmm. This is called the Battle of the Flags. Oh
Boy
Oh
All right, let's go
You want a piece of me I
Don't want a piece of you. I want the whole thing
This is a is a happy Madison
Happy Gilmore. Yeah, Billy Madison, right? Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore. Yeah, Happy Madison is the company that makes the films. I think
correct
I
Like the the older the film you go a lot of films have the fucking watermelon punch sounds
I
Get movie gotta pause
So what I'm how twitch are planning on trying to introduce some kind of
Watch together system that you can actually watch the stuff from Amazon Prime without it like live with an audience. Oh
That's cool. Like if that goes ahead
You tube you better catch up quick cuz we're gonna want to do that
Watch batwoman with a live audience. What is shitty? Oh, no
It's a trap
I went well, didn't it?
Now you've had enough so think that the dragon would eat the legs it wouldn't even be a thing you just be over
Well, it depends on how big the legs are bitch in comparison to the dragon
looking Quentin face randomly
Is you fap endgame part two
You
See how this Sony movie ones I was like, I'm sure they were gonna get hit with some kind of
Hopefully not struck down entirely. Oh
This is the 2014 one
I am a muto in this case. It's a 2014 one. Okay better than King of the Monsters for sure
Hot excrement does not actually come close to describing this
So titty inside something
Oh
Yeah, just FYI so this is actually a clip from this movie do you remember
Rags Mel that they say the King Ghidorah is making the monsters do naughty things
Yeah weird King Ghidorah is not even around in this film, huh?
Monsters fucking up everything
Trek what's the fuck film you are drunk. I
Think this film was intended for traditional reviewers and they will be oh I remember saying that because if I didn't
Patrick Willems said that a
traditional reviewers know this stuff and
There's the only traditional reviewer on YouTube is movie Bob though
I think he'd involve just right into that selection now because those two are buddies
I
Logic as much as possible since traditional reviewers of the only people who appreciate think this is like Oh
Patrick Willems and movie Bob and just write a traditional reviewers
Glad we moved beyond those traditions. They say maybe maybe there's some traditions. We should just let let go a lack of logic
Yeah, I don't know if I like this movie more than king of the monsters in terms of the entertaining bits
Quote-unquote, but Bryan Cranston is in the majority of the human moments or at least half of them in this film
So that's way better than anyone in
Oh, they're all just the only good person they had is completely wasted
Yeah, I wouldn't call waste. Well, he's half. It's kind of complicated. It's like a really he's like our main character for a while
So it's like good shit. They should have done the same with Charles dance. Fuck it. I know he's old
I know what happens to Bryan Cranston's character. Hello there. I've heard people complain about it
Yeah, because it was a really stupid decision
That's a shipping video I didn't realize
Why do we have to be giant hideous monsters what's that about huh?
You're trying to tell me
I
Fap okay. So the idea is the radiation helps the monster
lay like egg things
Trying to lay if app is if I was helping it lay TFA part 3
I'm confused, but all right
official music video
music video
So this is space efap just an ordinary resupply mission. This is Kerbal, which means I can play it in full
Thank the goodness
You see the thumbnails just got Jay's face Oh
22 tons of rhino milk sponsored by Jeff
music video
It's in cheaper rocket season
I think we can all see what that that's not right. Oh milk at all
The music is so
Boy he coming
Oh
Handling that thing is not easy and quite some trading had to be done to move it like this
I guess I'm the world's best low gravity try leg pilot now
It's available in Steam Workshop just search for the triskelion terror
Anyways guys good shit
So this one's go loads of clips from music I don't know what's gonna happen in terms of
Copyright we'll do what we can
Even three, I think three seconds that will get me in trouble. I don't know what's gonna happen with this. This is
This is all music
Yes, this is a this video is a minefield. Do you think it's too dangerous or what?
I don't know. It might be too dangerous. I think this might because this one's literally
music yeah
This might be one we because the problem the problem is less because I can fight claims
Even though I'll probably have like 17 on this efap just takes one and it's as well say the worst-case scenario
I get a strike and then the stream goes down
Which is possible?
I wouldn't it takes it can take a month to clear a strike
So like this is not something that you know
Is this some is can we place this like for somebody else to watch in their own time?
Oh, well, I can link it I guess yeah, it's like on YouTube or some it'll it's not currently in the description. It will be
You know when it gets re-uploaded, also, it's called quick play everyone's theme. It's by coherent ramblings
And yeah, I would love it, but it's super dangerous. That's all
Over it doesn't work differently for um being live this is uploading as well
Because like YouTube's like oh you trying to make money off it like whoa. Whoa, buddy
By the way, um, I'm gonna hang on a minute
I'm gonna um
Do you mind if I step out for a little bit because I got some work stuff that came up
I gotta make a bunch of stupid calls. Um, I'll I can step back in when i'm done. Is that okay? Sure
Okay, well, um, i'll just jump back in when i'm done so uh, you guys enjoy yourselves i'll be back in a bit
All right. Sure. Sure. Yes. This is a great movie by the way
What is it?
Okay
I'm gonna have to pause gotta be careful even though i've already let more than it played than I probably should have
Let's uh, let's quit this video
Yes
Let's go that went well, didn't it?
Um
It is a cool screwdriver hello, man
So
It's quitting time I guess it's quitting time
It's quitting time as in not to be confused with quitting time. No, no, no
I was gonna say like, you know, um
I I was I was here for the promise of memes. Oh
kick me
Actually, well now I can't do memes because chat's gonna be upset at me if I do memes it's quitting time
How long are you free for jay? I'm free for a while. All right, then
Oh, yeah people point that out. You said you were free for a while. You stayed like about the 10 hours
Well, that is a while. Yes, it is
The elephant music's on the other side of the door
Where did we kick jay originate from I genuinely don't know was it just kick v and it got turned into jay
Me
As awkward as this sounds oh are you guys ready for some memes?
Is
This is really good this I really like this works really well this scene is yeah super
For jack saint who doesn't understand that people who said to superchats also make a meme about the super chat
Lest you be yeeted and chat will bring great famine upon you my goodness. Oh, no
No
No vegans
The elongated male critic rags
Oh
I love it. What a great movie. So I guess this came after the end of the spoon wars
Oh, i'm also back from the dead I found out I I didn't I I wasn't aware that I had died
But I had died, um, and the chronicles is the chronicles of the epic spooder man wars
But die i'm back I forced myself back from the grave so I can have my kangaroo jack. Oh boy
Last time on spooder wars loyalty to disney
salvation
Like how everybody like this when they made this
Loyalty is life number 14 the aftermath
Quintan you won the coin toss tell him about the about the racism and the sexism in star wars. So, um
Here's the thing. I fucking hate marsupials. You know today's my best
I would be a much happier person if we found a way to
Ship is fine
Ouch follow
The rules that you learn that's dale by the way my goodness he's doctor
Oh my god, they're all here metaphor for races
Point of meaningless as an act of film criticism to oh my god
If I can shoot the laser beams out of my hands pretty applicable good stuff
That guy would be toast theme doesn't mean
Spits today's episode is inspired in part by a recently viral youtube video, but you're watching movies wrong. You're watching movies
Sorry fighter sounds well
This is like if uh, like if a poop like remember youtube kind of yeah
I don't think sjw is a real
You
Sexual harassment that you get to look at women at the same time
Bring it back this would resolve cancel culture completely
God they killed rhino. So what is
I'm assuming this show is a specific spider-man cartoon versus
I guess not when I know a person is actually touching on a deeper pet peeve. I have
No, you can like stuff that's objectively bad. I really like some of the faster
Kick his ass for me. Look at women
Sometimes they just don't like women
I can't believe he said that sometimes they just don't like women
Help
Uh-oh people are saying f and oh no, oh no
Chat stream take it down. Oh, yeah
Oh shit
Oh
Has it been suspended yeah, what's the other reason for policy violations what?
Stream suspended for policy violations. What's
What does that mean I assume the spider-man cartoon has got some heavy copyright it was either that or one before this
Which
Which one which one would it have been I haven't got any notifications for it yet apparently i'm oh it's back
It's back
Yeah, it can't be back if if there's policy violations that seems very unlikely. I'm gonna send it
It's back for me
Yeah
You saw it say policy violations. Yes. Yeah
And then just went back online
Just you know, you just stopped violating policy. It's okay, but what?
We don't know what we did wrong
My guess is that they could my guess is that it was like a live copyright id
And then as soon as you turned it off, it was like, oh they've stopped doing it
Is that how that worked? I don't think that's how that works though
I've never heard that well that would that would explain what just happened to us
Well, no give it a give it five minutes. See what happens
I'm gonna load it up my phone so I can see if it goes down again
I'm gonna I guess use the loo
Do it. This is yeah, this was my concern. Don't worry. Don't worry. I'm doing it
You violated policy you showed a bunch of memes in a video
Gosh
This is why i'm always good said about beams videos. Anyway, it's not the part where we can't get the efap back up
Once it's uploaded to moolah because I can wait on that
It's a tourist one kills my stream. That's the worry
You also want a separate platform to be able to stream the memes on
I suppose that might be the answer at one point
Maybe like twitch
Is twitch millennium or stuff like this twitch? Um, don't they mute your vod instead of killing you?
uh
Well, the only time my streams got muted or the vods got muted was when I was playing
third age
So apparently like music and stuff was pretty hard
Like those got like
Muted all the way through like the ost is like out taboo
You violated the law apparently there's background music in this meme. That's
From amazing spider-man 2 that's what some people have been saying
Huh?
I didn't even oh my god, imagine
striking someone because they use content from
Amazing spider-man 2 I know you'd think they'd have standards about all of this
But no apparently even bad films deserve copyright. What's that about?
Oh
New feature happened to sfo this morning because I got relevance to anything we're talking about
Oh, yeah, i'm not saying twitch is fucking lenient and other things efap would have been banned off twitch probably by now
I don't know actually though
But um, I mean we're still up
Yeah, speaking of still being up i'm gonna have to not be in in a minute. So i'm gonna have to hop out
Really jay, even though this some videos are very relevant to you coming up
Uh, it's fine
The people who made them are gonna be very disappointed. They're gonna put down disagreements
You know what you've you've persuaded me to stay for at least
20
Hours, what should I do about what should I do about this video then should I keep playing it even though it's the whole thing?
Or what should I do?
No idea. Do advise me
I have to go to toilet. Yeah
Um, I just have to pause more maybe neckbeards on me
You guys I wish I could play it for longer than a few seconds
Chad efap stream goes straight back to violating policy
It's like don't you play it like but but
Crap
What the hell happened to quinniton quinniton
I think oh my they don't have quotes
Don't play it. It's dangerous. Look at wibbit bad lad. Don't risk it. I mean the music's not playing anymore at least
Don't know it was the music though true, um, but if that was the reason it was going down
Uh
Feels bad man, if we just go through real real nice and carefully quick get the packet arm off of him
Jay you have to come up with commentary on every six seconds
Um, uh, he's brown table funny
I'm being harassed. You're not being harassed. You're just being crushed by a fatman
Wait, he's drunk
So there's got to be some commentary there
I laughed because
Um
The tie fighter sound is perfect. There we go. I did it. I said it
I like to think patrick willams makes a tie fighter sound in real life. Well, he uh, if not not wally walks
Only if he's like flowing like if he's flung through the air, he will make it trying to escape like a bitch
Escape
Hey, get your ass off of there oh shit
That's a nice looking window, yeah, yeah
YouTube harassment that's that is
Precisely what this is get back here bird brain
Fucking re-uploading. This is gonna be a nightmare. They're gonna be like no no no
At least efap
1459 is sacred and safe, you know, that's fine
Women you're watching movies wrong
I like that he had that tweet about like how I don't regret saying watch your movie wrong
It's people taking it out of context and i'm always just all like listening to it wrong or understanding it wrong
I'm just like what the hell did you mean by it?
It's not even the worst part of the video. I think it gives you guys want to say that it's not it's it's partly a joke
It's like how could that partly be a joke? That doesn't make sense
I don't know about space wizards intended for trouble. That's not a
Oh my god, vulture was a robot
I guess so the music is on more than more the song
Uh
I couldn't even hear it. Maybe i'm like really stupid
Just love drinking directly from the couch. Oh, they're right
There is a song and it's sort of like blanking it out because i'm trying to listen for the quotes
How is it that this is happening to us but he managed to upload this video without
You'd think that would have gotten taken down with all the music or because they monetize it
Uh
My guess is that it doesn't hit um that it hits streams with like a couple thousand people watching harder than it hits like
Uploads that get i'm guessing like a hundred or so fuses on this
Yeah, i'm, sorry, mr. Spooda wolves, man, but um, it's uh, it's too risky
We might we might get flumpled ingust
Oh, there's even more though like maybe this one doesn't have music
As in this other one i'm looking at I mean the stream still up so
Okay, that kind of does have music
Okay, listen, we can have damn it. This is soundtrack. What do I do? I can't play it
It looks like a big tub of jello it does
Beautiful
I want to play more of a bit of super risky again
How I don't understand how the stream got paused for community whatever and then really yeah, that's really weird
I don't understand policy violations
All right, i'm sorry we're not able to check this one out, uh
There's one for um a stardust the thing for 40k. I don't know if that has copyright on it either
My recommendation would I mean that's that's a
It's a fan
Thing that was made. I don't know that works. I think just a lot of these that are more risky record them offline and
Because you can't you can't get a strike for trying to upload something privately you actually can
Oh you can if you upload say for example like a full episode or something you'll just automatically get a strike
It's like hey, we can see what you're doing
All right, but if you but like if you upload something like this, it's clearly is fair use and you can argue as
Yeah, all right, i'm here. I made it
Skip over about three because the the yeah, they're like there's lots of copy tisms
Yeah
We're not sure about this is like an efap version of
The 40k thing. Oh, it's star tests. Yeah, I don't know if
And look how well it's made
The the the the image masking for a moment there oh so good. Yeah, so
Uh, I don't know if this will be here. Oh depth of field. Oh depth of field. Yeah
Artificial pair of blocks they did say this is uh fan made though. So it should be arranged. Yeah, I hope they believe themselves to be
warriors
So
In my subjective opinion
Actual arguments
A review is nothing more than a description of an experience
You're so titanically ugly
This is a film
Without face wizards intended for children
There's no arguments being made here
A gun the bark
You're kind of watching movies wrong
Oh wow
Oh
Hello there ladies and gentlemen
This movie's a fucking mess
Whoa
Crosses that went well, didn't it?
Apparently a bunch of people have the that went well didn't it as an audio clip from me suspended a funeral
What was really cool?
Is about that is that there's a there's a part where one of the space marines?
Eye lenses starts to crack from the pressure and he had that on the glasses and I was like, oh wow
That's a good touch. Yeah, and if this apparently this was made by one guy
I didn't actually know that about it started go check it out
Let's start. It's 40k fan film
Um, is this a corridor? What's the channel corridor digital?
Is that who it is? I don't know. No, they have an episode about it about how cool it is
But yeah, just uh
Pretty good shit and uh, there's a very that's a that's a really good meme
Um, excellent work. All right, very good which pushes us on to uh more copyright risks
I feel like you've been eternally scarred by that one feeling down gay
Hey
Hi mauler, probably wolf and rags too. Don't you want to know what happened? Say hi to jay
The dawn survived
Chilly met me
Because if these are going to be my last words, then you're gonna listen because the dicks about this too the doctor who stuff
I got hit with the bbc
bbc pulled a um
Think I think a 15 minute video of mine because I played that minute trailer within it
with or without the audio
And I took the time ball sex and poured it into his head and turned him into dust
The god of all ether
And I destroyed him this was on purpose. This is a genuine response to this kindly. Fuck you. Hey, what's going on guys?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
ponald
Uh, I love it. I can only play it for seconds at a time, but I keep forgetting just pause
Yeah
That's me always that you are powerless
How are you? Oh same old, you know
What tonal'd really align himself with the taxon? I don't know
Sexual harassment
Danger
Survive that flame wars I envisioned myself as happy as I was the day diablo 2 came out
I'd spend the next six months in an orgasm
You can you can watch this
What
Wait they go down and get off for fuck's sake. Yeah
Yeah
Well, I think the solution is probably to
Record it offline like a new like a mini I get
We might
We did the talk to who ones before how come we're not alone?
I guess they've just got it more anal about it or something. They've
You've I don't know you've drawn more attention to the channel and now you know
Dear youtubin
Oh
Someone in the chat just said copyright harassment
I mean unironically. Yes. It's not like with as if this is even remotely the fucking original content, you know
Stream suspended for policy violations
He oh there he goes back again, that's so weird and now so the concern what is this
The concern I have is that maybe you get three chances
To you know, like three is the maximum time you can be suspended before it takes the stream down fully
Yeah, my my guess is it's probably not a good idea to carry on with them right now
Because there's another
Okay, so we might do any fab mini form
But I don't even know if i'll be able to upload them without them being booped
But we'll I guess we'll try well you put with being when you're uploading them
you basically get infinite tries to
Cut out footage. They don't like I guess all I have to actually do it as a sort of um
Like put the efap logo over it, you know what I mean like the same way we do with batwoman
Yeah, maybe that'll be the way we do it
um
all right, well
I guess we'll push on i'm gonna have to i'll skip over any that have like
because there's quite a few
This one was so good. That's a shame because this one is really good
Sad faces all around
Um, this one shouldn't get copyright
Like oh, don't you care about the substance of wales politics or people you know, we have a cool flag
I think I love man
Let's have a look
Oh man
Just leave man flank
I love these
Why would you say that
What does it mean rack
Did you just say is a sleigh of man
Is
The weights do you replace it?
Is
Like a shuriken
I
If all of the flags were personified into creatures and made to fight each other
Welsh flag just looks at this three-legged creature
It's got no face
The welsh the welsh flag, let me just be confused. Why do I have to fight this?
I mean
That's true with steer ups
So it's ready to write some kind of well not steer ups, um, what are they what are they called?
They're all right legs
I just want to point out the super chat's relevant. It's just a cheap swastika
The problem is you know, they're one of those kids they're trying not to do their swastika pose
I feel like I would see that before that's amazing
That I remember that man that's what I remember that magical magical
Oh my goodness
That stream was so so amazing this one should be okay
Only small as long as I pause at least once
Come on you try it. No, I couldn't yeah, just breathe slowly
I don't know if you guys have seen this episode, but um
What basically happens is this woman is trying to
Get marj to be a little bit less like stiff with everything and uh, she started to fire a gun
Anyone seen this for?
I think a long time ago. I don't remember. I can't remember it
Marj ends up shooting some cans that have been just conveniently on this this this like a fence
Whatever and as soon as she shoots the one of them this old man comes out. He goes my antique cans. Why didn't you?
Shot some cans
I hear it. I hear it my themes
Look what you're done to him. Look what you're done to him
I love that it was bob. I hope stream doesn't get suspended for that
Oh, yes, another one that's immune to suspension
woohoo
Rex will even want me to shoot bob's themes
Yeah, when a homeless person's murdered no one gives a
flex journey of self-actualization through realizing
Society can be tough. The real cause of all of your problems is probably a woman but because this is a
I am just I am baffled. I am absolutely at a loss
Completely, there's a nine. We don't even groundless. No, no evidence is supported. My mouth is just open
I'm like a good idea
Singapore will save us because this is a movie that's only constructed to confer a
It's like he's an alien speaking some intergalactic language, I don't understand how could you even begin to think that's been heck
Well, that was awesome. I love the art style. That was fantastic. I love it. Singapore will save us
And it's true
So this is e-man gameplay i'm pretty sure this is from a game trailer for a game it's the right line so
Wow is that a thing man impressive
Rise of Skywalker was still uh standing for a little bit there because we haven't yet been able
To check it out. Who knows
How amazing it will be?
So jay
You may be aware of this. I believe you may have seen it already. It's it's quite the video
You ready for this?
Yes
Oh, no, I see this I'm aware of this
That's that's you
It's clearly in the film and it's like mass amnesia for kids
Mass amnesia
This is the f***ing this is the fbi in the film
There we go
I'd have to do this
So
Something that people can think
I'm literally gonna write that on my ego for like three years
Okay
Are you drinking from a geode is that a geode, okay
Did moxus do this
E-fat meme jay finally drinks rhino milk off a gee
Yeah, okay. Yeah
You drink it off a geode
So this is what you sent me jay because we kind of baffled that it was created. Uh
Oh, what is it? It's fully original animation, right? Well, I guess we'll play it first
I don't like them button chemicals in the water that turn the freaking frogs gay
Do you understand that?
I'm gonna say it real slow for you
For your life
My goodness
It's not funny
Sponge
So you clarified right that that's like an animation they made specific because of because of you
I I think so. Yeah
Like why i'm genuinely confused just to why someone went you know what i'm gonna do with my day?
But I like it I like the decision
and
I'm thankful for it. Then there is this legendary meme
but uh
I think we all need to accept and enjoy
Tracer
We're taking some time to construct this
Does
So
I like that
The community has sort of collectively decided that the place I need to be kicked is my eyes
Yeah, they gave you the rhino bill too. It's very important part of your character
Keep your shit in. That's the world building
Uh, it's about family that's what's so great about it
You
Created by joss weeden this is called what makes good rat
So I think it's like a documentary is very serious thing. I love documentaries
Hello there ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to a student's philosophical information
or aspie
On aspie
We'll be taking a look at a question that's playing to the greatest. Please be generic music that can't be copyrighted
Please please please please
Minds in human history said begirious in 429 b.c
makrisan tropus kakos
Translated we get the common philosophical question
What makes good rat?
Before we work on answering this question, we'll have to define our terms
first
What is
good
Many scholars believe that what beginning is meant by good was reaching of a standard
But that's just their opinion. I choose to go with the third definition on google
possessing or displaying
Virtuous
So now the question becomes what makes virtuous rat?
but what is
virtuous
To be virtuous is to have high moral standards
Obviously, there's only one definition of the word
however
What is a high moral standard?
after all
Voltaire teaches us that morality is subjective
in his book
By a big case
Often murder is acceptable in my known subjective opinion
This disproves objective analysis
Where does that leave us?
Well
We have to ask the question
What makes good rat in my opinion?
This works to our advantage as it is a fact that everything is subjective
But what is an opinion?
Well for that we look to be giddiest teacher
That being mr. Freudian in a transcript of the 512 bc novel
Freudian tells us
The truth is the lie of belief
But what does this mean?
well
in my opinion
What he factually meant was that what we believe to be true
Is really just our opinion
and so
We come back to our question
the question
That which has come to symbolize the divide between the upper and lower classes
What makes good rat?
Well
I think what begidious intended with this question was to spark this very discussion
To make us realize that objectivity does not exist as Bilbo Baggins once said
That will have to do for this episode of aspie
On screen are some of the people who inspired this video and I highly recommend their videos on philosophical tisms
I like it. It feels very inspired by gedelve actually. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah
I'm at this weird point where i'm like, okay. I'm really kind of tired. Although we're just sort of
Just letting anything wash over me and that was
I was like, oh, okay. Oh
Yes
Beautiful. It seems this was very inspired. I think as well
So a quick disclaimer before we jump into the video
Everything that follows is just my opinion guys
Now I am going to make a number of objective claims in this video
But see what i'm doing now is i'm framing them all as my opinion so that you can't criticize me or say that i'm wrong
This is called the film you hate is actually genius and here's why dash npc reviews
Okay, so remember that this is just my opinion and you're not allowed to criticize me. Okay, are we clear?
All right, let's jump into the video that new movie you criticize is actually genius and you're a bad person if you don't like it
And also that old movie that you really like is problematic and you're a bad person if you still like it
So
What's worse
I've noticed a lot of people online especially straight white men seem to be really mad about this new movie
So they're spewing their toxic hate claiming that their opinions are objective and anyone who likes the movie is wrong
Now I could spend time talking about the legitimate flaws and things that the movie doesn't do as well as it could
But honestly, no movie is perfect except for sorry to bother you because capitalism is evil
But really I don't want to think into this idea that pop culture blockbusters are even to be taken seriously in the first place
Unless of course you really love them in which case they absolutely should be taken seriously and furthermore
There is no such thing as objectivity in art. There are only better and worse subjective opinions
Now to talk about how great this movie is I might have to get into spoiler territory
So here's your warning if you don't want to hear me recap the entire plot in a boring and uninteresting manner
Then skip to this timecode
So the movie starts with this and then this thing happens and this person says oh my god
That's crazy. And then this other thing happens and they're like, oh my goodness
And then this other thing happens and then she doesn't like that
So she says hey, you stop that and then captain baubles
And then the movie's over now a lot of haters and the toxic families of this intellectual property have said that politics is ruining
This franchise what I say to that is boo hoo hoo
And besides everything is political therefore a good film is a film with good politics. See these new movies
Have the right politics the old movies
Let's just say they were a product of their time
But also you're not allowed to like them
It's time to change if you still like something that was a product of its time
That means you're evil now another thing these so-called critics won't stop harping about is the plot
They say the plot makes no sense
And to that I say
And there you go
And there you go one but really like any sane person
I'm going to forgive little tiny holes in the plot because what really makes a movie is themes
Oh, thank god he's got papyrus
Now as anyone who actually studied the art of cinema and filmmaking knows
Like me by the way good themes make good art regardless of how they're executed. See this movie has really strong themes of
hope
and despair success and failure life and
Death now i'm going to quote an intellectual
Whether or not it's relevant to the topic at hand to show that my film studies degree wasn't a waste of time
As the analytical psychologist eric noieman once wrote all the objects of the outside and inside worlds are
introjected
And are there represented according to their value the selection
Arrangement gradation and elimination of the contents are represented
And in large measure on the cultural canon within which consciousness develops and by which it is conditioned
But it is characteristic
Under all circumstances to create for himself a consciously constellated and synthetically constructed view of the world
however great or small in scope
See a smart person said that and I quoted them. So I am also smart by association
Now there is one last thing. I should probably mention about criticisms of this movie and that's the character of blank
A lot of people think blank is a poorly written
unlikable
nothing of a character
And that's just wrong. I'm not going to explain why that's wrong
It just is but more importantly they criticize her for having no flaws and no obstacles to overcome
I don't buy the marysue thing. Anyway, I found that I find the term sexist
You go girl now a lot of morally good people try to defend her saying that no
She does have flaws and obstacles to overcome
But i'm going to take kind of a bold stance here and say that it's good that she doesn't have any flaws or obstacles
To overcome you see blank is a insert minority group character
And if we said that insert minority group characters had flaws then we'd be saying that insert minority group were flawed
And that would be bigoted. I for one think
She has no flaws to overcome
Because it's showing this insert minority group community that they're perfect just the way they are
And on that note
That's all I have for you in this video. I'd like to thank my mega sexy patrons for supporting me my parents their parents
That wasn't real communism
Now I have become death
Michael brown house is funny
Mindless sick event. Oh, this is my favorite just right video skill share for sponsoring this video
If you like this video, please mail pallets of cash directly to my
Thanks for watching and always remember everything is objectively subjective so you're not allowed to criticize me
That was amazing
This is crazy who are very talented individual this only has 57 views this must change subscribing to you
This is a make by capital o opinions. Yeah. Oh my goodness. This is an amazing video. It's actually
I love this so much. It was very enjoyable and cathartic
Oh my goodness, I I would this is all after all of the apps that we've done
I feel like this is what we've watched like every week every week
Please mail pallets of cash to my house
I just like the skill shoes
Oh my god, we've experienced it soon I'm a
Like the the themes thing hit it's just too it's too real
It's too real
Another bit where he's like i'm just gonna quote the fucking the whole bit was great
Make more content, please. I'm gonna watch it all. That's so good. Like that's so good
Oh man that was inspired by just right
So
There's probably a few more image memes and video memes that I could show a lot of them the copyright ones that i'm concerned about
So I think the plan will be to try and collect them up and maybe do any fab mini forum
of some kind
Yeah, uh, see what you do with that
then um
And i'll catch like any image memes i've missed
I will attempt to recapture them because I know i've got a bunch on twitter already
but um
platter
Yep, and some I really like too. They're looking looking pretty pretty sexy. It's pretty swag
Some of them i'm just i'm just gonna say like we're gonna push on to um
The super chats because i'm kind of
Edging tool trying to end this stream to see what kind of trouble my channel might be in. I'm hoping it's done
hooray
But um, you know, they're letting me be alive right now. So that's reassuring. Yeah, that's cool
I love it when they let you do that
Yeah, it's very kind of them
But yeah j, I guess if you're um, if you're deleted in the head you're welcome to um, yeah
i'm probably gonna skip away and
Yes, yes
Bye toodles. Bye. Bye. Bye. Toodles. See ya
What a what a god now we can fucking party
All right. Let's do it. So there were two
Uh chats that we missed when we went went offline last night rags. Um, do you want to know what they are?
Say what there were two super chats that came in after we went offline last uh, well last you've happened. Oh, that's too bad
We gotta do you we must acquire them. I have um, would you like to know what the first one is?
I would yeah
gay
well
Fakers yeah fair enough. Good stuff. I ain't gonna say no to that
and then
Uh, we've got
Don't let jenny vote
Um raw it was raw it's i'm so sorry, but um
Uh, there's nothing we can do about this. It's a part of the law. She can vote. Um, he can vote not twice though
Definitely not twice just the once
Forged once oh the uh, the pixel drawing I I showed was not uh
Yes, I think I said I I I got something mixed up i'm trying to keep track i've got a lot of messages right now
The toxic brood stats with you apparently there's some comments flowing in all that guy's video good stuff. Give me some love
It's good. You know, man, like that video really was legit. Excellent. Yeah, it was really good
And yeah, oh and this i've been getting messages people can sorry about the memes causing trouble. It's not your fault
It's never like I don't
We're not, you know, we know what we're doing with like playing them
But you never know sometimes something slipped through some the rules are always different literally the rules for each and every um
like individual meme individual video or piece of music like youtube is different with all of them
like I said, it's really weird that we've got the um
We can play the avengers, you know, like the marvel opening theme in full, uh from the films where they show like the um
The comics flowing like with pages you can play all of that for some reason and monetize it
yeah, you're not allowed to um
Play the avengers theme for longer than like I think it's like that might be 10 seconds or so, but um
Yeah, I know there's a there's an influx of new stuff. I can see it on the discord
Um, i'm gonna collect them up make sure I grab them. Uh, but for now, I think we're um
We're probably pretty good with five hours of just meme
Like the result was always good. Yeah, that's quite a bit. Yeah
um
Okay
Also, welcome back
Thank you. I am back now. Sorry about that. Thank you
Oh you missed uh, you missed a great video i'll i'll send you it
Yeah, it's been an hour. I figured I was gonna miss something really good
Uh, we've sent people to it as well, but you should check it out at some point. It'll make you laugh
It's called the film you actually hate. Well, the film you hate is actually genius and here's why
Um, but yes, good stuff. Everyone's gonna be keeping an eye on him for future mpc reviews
Okay
Uh, but metal how was the sex
Excuse me, that's the first stupid chat of this stream. James Moore wants to know how he sexes
Mm-hmm. Was it everything you hoped for and more?
It was like a three out of ten three out of ten
Oh, it could be with well, just wait till you try it with a girl. Oh you
Got him fucked up. That's gonna screw it up, right?
You gotta compare a girl's butt to a boy's butt
Two e-faps in a row also a message for death bullshit 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16, etc
Okay
I I don't get it. But all right
I have a series that i've made over the years and I I stopped at episode 15. Oh, you told my idiot box
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so before we get a lot of 16 requests, huh?
Uh, yeah
I had 10 minutes. I I felt really shitty about it. I I assure you
I mean we all do what we can. Um
Patience is a virtue as as as she said in the mummy
That is true. People see the mummy's a good movie
Mummy is good
I had 10 minutes left on the last one you massives. That's right
You can play them both at the same time get that 10 minutes sorted and then play this one. It's all good
Uh, if he hasn't seen blade runner or lord of the rings
When are we gonna stop trying to save jay and take him out back like old yella also hi jay?
Also
Uh
kick jab doe
No, never ever never kick a jab while he's down, which is always
Hug jeb, this means never kick him. Uh, i'm gonna chafe my jab from all this efap and
Oh fapping kick jay
Uh completely random question usually but is calum a normal welsh name?
I have no idea
uh
Doesn't even know I don't I have no idea what the origins of of of the name is
Are all they could they could be from anywhere?
Oh
Also, hi rex
Hey
I should be getting into my new computer this month gang the end of the meme drought is upon us my friends
Excellent. That's from my repository
though
Oh, yeah, the stream more than ever. It's just apparently
do what you can memers to
counter
copyright because
Yeah, because it'll hurt your meme when it's being played. It will affect our ability to enjoy the meme
Oh, it was maybe you guys want to come up with
I don't like a like a list or pdf of approved music that you know stuff like that or try to use um
Like I know youtube has a huge library of stuff. That's cleared for copyright
Yeah, and then obviously when you want to reference movies, it's tough
Because
I could pull this you might have to use like a
A different version of them or a parody of them because we we've loved a lot of the movie references and stuff
I'm just saying that like it gets if we get like a five minute meme video, that's all from a movie
It's going to take us a while to get through it and it'll often damage the pacing of jokes in it as well
Yeah
And funnily enough we had a guy
Do what was that like a three minute video of like paint drawings and we were laughing our ass off of it. So yeah, man
Don't like don't be too considerate about making it like cinematic and stuff
Like we love all the effort everyone's putting in it's just we're just really concerned about being able to show stuff in its natural form
in its raw form
Reviewers are saying the new terminator is actually good. Perhaps humanity does have a dark fate thoughts
Sad it's really bad
If anything it's gotten worse in my head more i've been thinking about it
um bad movie
Also salutations ragsimus
Hello salutations to you. And yeah, the pixel drawing I showed was not smile around. It was psa stitch. Uh
But there you go. It was like the all black figure with the the white
Uh face or white eyes and white teeth and I was like, oh, yeah, you can totally mix those up in pixel form
Uh me they took a week off I can get caught up more the frack you were doing a 12 hour on saturday and another one
On sunday we didn't mean to
intended accident
Hello guys, are there any film shows that you would consider nearly objectively perfect?
Um
No shows that i've watched that i've felt that way about
That is a really tough one because I don't watch a lot of shows and I don't watch a heck of a lot of movies either
The best we get is like seasons or episodes rather than a whole show
Probably episodes actually and then movies there's a handful
That I struggle to find holes in
Um, but not many that I find to be 100 clean like they have small mistakes or something that
Are totally understandable for a massive production. Yeah
massive
Um, it's like well if you have a film that's really good and then you go
Ah, but they let's say lord of the rings to go. Oh, there's that car in the background one of the scenes like so that
Could have been prevented
Meaning theoretically possible. That's what I mean by that. Oh, yeah. Absolutely
I will okay. Yeah, I uh breaking bad. What about breaking bad?
I have plot issues with some of uh, I think season three or four of breaking bad
And I think some of the characters could have used
um
a little help like uh
Marie is a character that I look back on and i'm like, what was her journey of five seasons? She's a klepto
And annoying there's not a lot going on with marie
I love everything with walt pretty much. Uh, I think gust makes a couple of irrational decisions at certain points once
The gang bangers are killed by waltz
There's a couple of things
Thanks, pretty great. I like yeah. No, I was gonna say by the way
The breaking bad is my pick for like best objectively a tv show like I don't need to come across one that has more consistent. Um
The production values in in most aspects buffy's my favorite, but buffy's got a shit ton of problems
Um, they're just all in regards that don't damage my experience as in
Uh, the characters are all intact
For the most part. Yeah, for sure. Um
Band of brothers is probably a good suggestion actually, uh, oh, yeah, that's a fantastic tv show
Oh, yes, you know people saying skyla
Yeah having her being annoying is one thing but
Is she inconsistent? Uh, we'd have to look through it all
Saving power ryan is pretty damn good. Yeah saving power ryan's up there as well. I don't think she was really
Like as inconsistent as marie. I think marie is pretty bad. Um
But I feel like maybe skylar was maybe just a little more
Annoying than people would have liked, you know, it's all like
Constantly hounding the poor cancer guy who's obviously going through a hard time and everything
It's like I think they're kind of putting themselves in the seat like okay. Well, he's got a ton of cancer
Maybe I shouldn't treat him as much of crap as skylar did, you know, he got a ton of cancer
Yeah, he's got to cut it. He's all over his cancer body. It's crazy. You can have different amounts of cancer. So
And once you know someone dies of cancer and they pull it all out of him and put him a big bag the bag way a ton
The suit absolutely is perfect it will be when it fits jeb
Yeah, it's true batarangs calibrate themselves for him
About walking dead
Holy shit, the walking dead's terrible. Uh, it's like first season. Yeah pretty good the rest. Uh, fuck off
Dances with jebbs. Hello all my jeb words
Rags, I want to look you in the eyes when you poop with the door open
I will not stop with these comments until my demands are met
All right, oh no, you will not stop skipping money. Is that a super is that a super chat?
It is every time that's an an unusual threat
But
I I know I know and it ain't about the money. It ain't about the money
It's about a pretty helps but it's about the principle of I don't make eye contacts with people while i'm fucking dropping a stink pickle
It ain't happening. All right
It's fair enough
Hi rags, it's weird. It's weird for me
Um, any thoughts on the fitoria map?
Um
It's okay, um
I think that invasion could use quite a few tweaks the ending the the end section is way too easy for the attackers
And if defenders can just be really annoying with it by guarding the last villager
I don't like the emphasis on making a lot of players like nobles and super tall guards and stuff
The less super soldier characters that are available for play the better. Um
Um
It's okay, uh, definitely
Saveable it's not like bad right now. It's just okay, and it could be better. They need to readjust the last position especially
and um
That that's really my main concern with it. Maybe instead of giving especially now that the mortar on the uh,
Wall point is gone
But they should take away the whole making people super powerful. I think it'd be better as well
And what I wish they'd given more cosmetics I think that's my big thing
Okay, uh
Sorry, this has been asked already haven't been called the last stream yet. No, I think that was entirely original as a question
uh
I tapped myself out with the avatar super chat yesterday. So i'll just say hi all and thanks to the content heart you rags
Oh heart you
What do you guys think about the new?
Tyler riser
aka best thick girl
No idea what I like. I tell you
Eight leah eight leah riser. Can you spell up for me real quick? I will paste it to you
You can see it in its natural form
Um
Oh, I haven't played it it looks like a game
Yeah, it's like it's like a jrpg I think I think I saw it pop up on steam sometime the protagonist is
Pretty thick. All right. Yeah, she's pretty lovely. Definitely lovely
Also chat can I get a panda rau panda rau also I need this five dollars for rent
Oh
Well, well
Well, it's more important living someplace or giving super chats to us
Uh, please tell me you're showing efap the movie part one today
I would love to see reactions to jay getting redacted for youtube super chat
um if that's that so
Is that the one that's like 17 minutes? Yeah. Yeah
Um, i'm not saying there's a time limit like memes
But 17 minutes starts to get super long man for memes and um, we've got like millions to get through
oftentimes
so like 17 minutes is a
Pretty long really long. It's uh, yeah. Um, like I don't discourage anybody from doing whatever they want to do and everything but
um
We like
Like joke heavy short and sweet angled memes instead of like super long movie long narratives or anything
Like don't you don't need to worry yourselves and making like an actual movie out of
uh
Stuff yeah
I will watch it
More along man batting people level five of your laughs are infectious. Hi wags
Hello
I think the t-800 named himself carl
All right
Is that supposed to help it I don't I don't know actually I guess he saw someone named carl in tv and he was like
I'll call myself carl. I'll be carl carl is the name I will use
Also, would the movie be better in any way if the t-800 named himself jab instead of oh, yes
Oh, yes better. Oh, that would be so good
Best of the series you're not allowed to insult efap if you haven't seen every episode
And I knew batwoman would be a terrible show from the crossover episode before the show started kick rags. Hi j. Oh
Oh, well, that's oh
Ban you from chat. Um
Yeah, that's sort of about the weird ass logic like you can't criticize batwoman episodes of having seen all those like no
You haven't seen them either, but you've come to the conclusion that they're amazing. So
Um, what now maybe maybe they have it. Maybe they're like no, it's actually terrible, but i'm not gonna say until it's over
Uh marriage is between a man and a woman or two dudes
Okay, all right, I agree it's either one of those well, what about a woman and a woman
No, no, not allowed doesn't count
Uh put j in the kick tier
Oh
No country for old jab
You fap we all fap together. No
Uh chase face came up with long man bad from making fun of jack chase face has a long man bad origin. Nice
Hmm he does. Um, I don't know. Yeah, I do
Tonal tier is beyond the barriers of blockage
Yes
Uh wolfs retired last street made me fail. No, not november. Oh, no
So, sorry, I was always next year quick play
I don't know what jeb's theme would be the benny hill theme. Um
I mean while he's running on his little mouse wheel
Yeah
Jay's on his redemption arc. He's the spike of efap villains. Yes. Very true
Uh, be wary for the efap is long and full of massives
Game of thrones
Where would you put us massives in the chat on the list?
Oh if chat got onto the list
in terms of like quality, I mean
um
It's not a bad question. Actually. I actually like that question. I mean a lot of the time they're the ones that essentially
Enable the meme to live they breathe the life. Yeah
It's almost like ranking them as hmm
I mean, I guess i'd say
Hmm
That's tough. I mean like there was a lot of great jeb memes like yesterday, you know, they kept going
Like they can decide whether or not a meme lives or dies. Basically. Yeah, does he ask the audience?
I feel like they they they are outside of the list almost or they are the list
Yeah, it feels odd to rank them
It really does and it's we're not trying to like like cop out of the answer
It just seems like a really odd thing to rate
I mean without the chat the whole list couldn't exist really
It sounds like it was suggesting a tier list for every single member who watched efap
Oh, so 3000 entries cool
Uh, so we recognize code gas in an old efap. I was wondering what your opinions were about the show
I liked it. I thought it was pretty good. I thought there was some tisms in it
Um still haven't seen it code you would also like to recommend wim book to wolf
I will save that comment
On the next I shall visit his tisms. I shall uh, let him know
Go here
Um
I'm surprised big jack films isn't on the list
Big jack films jack films
Doesn't sound like someone we've covered if we did I maybe I didn't realize um, yo that reminds me was fat man falling even on that list
No, but we haven't really covered them. We covered a portion of the podcast
He appeared on I don't know if that counts
I don't know
I don't think it takes more to be an efap villain
At least I think so. It looks obviously we covered uh, we we put angry joe up on there
But I think we would have been happy like fine if he wasn't there
Because we yeah bits
Uh, jim sterling should be in should be in b because he's too big to fit in with all the people in c
At the time of writing also, I can't type fat
You can't type fat
Oh man, that's fucked up
Really? You can't type fat because he typed f at t to say fat
So youtube blocks him from saying fat, I don't know maybe
Wow, it is pretty offensive. It is pretty offensive
The hardest choices require the strongest jabs
yep
Please do jabs tlj video before episode nine comes
Oh, they mean jenny's
Jenny was tough man
Yeah
Like jeb helped us through that stream
big time
a meme-like weapon
And yeah, like uh, you know, this is possible there's so many different streams
We've got to get done before uh episode nine comes out and ruins everything because that's just gonna be
There's like another two joker streams. I want to do
Really I want to do a dark fate one too and this isn't even including all the ones that are like guest specific so
Plus you still got you still got uh jack saint naret taxon's video to cover at some point
Oh the the new taxon video. Yeah, I mean that's not too much of a worry like but the
The other ones got to get them done. I want to talk about more more, you know
There's got to be a joker takeout there. That's not as terrible as uh, Jenny's, right?
Yeah
There's gotta be yeah extra credits didn't ask for the a tier they didn't choose it
Tell wolf he is missed. Oh, I think after the preview the stream last night. He's very aware
Oh, yeah
I recently discovered efap and i'm simply in love with rags too. Obviously, is it too much? Oh, that's great
Uh, is it too much to ask for my name to be in the mooler archive?
If not, you have to say it correctly though. Have my peasant student money. Love you mooler archive
What's the mooler archive
Um, I mean I could say it it's yohan lund or yohan lund I guess um
But yeah, I guess that puts it in the mooler archive to a degree
uh, put jenny nickels on the error rank above s or a
I like that. Everybody was very invested in how those places were placed even we were, you know, getting those accuracy important
Why are we ranking brown table tree sickles up next? Oh my god
snowman gaming equals steaks were ruined olive is a weird grape
That uh that the hell is a cherry tomato
Oh the cherry tomato thing. I remember that that didn't last though
You know the memes are like hunger games like they fight each other
It's crazy like some of them just don't make it
Like it's like I told you jay was very happy that um, i love man made it and it's very strong
But he was very upset that uh, aids bus died
Poor guy
It lived on a little bit on my stream though
Remember aids bus
Oh, it was uh to do with um, oh wait was rags there for that then i'm assuming it was it was the
Was it efap gaming 3 was it just a stream?
Uh
No, i don't know i'm not sure anymore
What about jared he practically created efap memes
I I think what wasn't the creation of efap means goes to um
Kyle ben wasn't that the first big significant meme i'm not saying it's the first meme, but
He was the one that kicked off the channel
Uh in my discord as well as like cataloging memes. So
I'd like to think because memes existed well before all of us, you know memes they've been around since
Cavemen could scratch on wolves eternal. Yeah
It's like I said before I think the very first meme I ever dealt with before was before the internet was around that was the
Eye fallen and I can't get up thing. I'm sure i've mentioned that before that was a meme through like radio and television and shit
Oh, there is kill roy
We have like lots lots lots of super chats left because i've been getting a bit tired myself
No, actually, uh, this should probably take about half an hour. Um, no, no, that's fine. Oh, wow, really?
Yeah, I mean it's this only half an hour to read all over super
It depends on what questions we get. Uh, list is missing eric butts and sore e-sports
Eric butts isn't a villain eric butts is no he's a sweetheart. He's just a sad person. He's just a really really sad adult human
Let him have fun with episode nine trailers. All right
And i'm not sure who saw e-sports is that could be one of the
Maybe podcast eric because eric is a villain in the sense that he's why star wars get now
Yes
He's the audience there appealing to
He is like fucking fat ass seals who will clap at anything
That took way longer than expected maula. Yes. I mean
You never know with memes
Surprised to be sure still learning to be electrician if the circuit for my bathroom outlet is objectively not ground fault protected
But I subjectively believe it is can I drop a toaster into my bathtub and survive?
Try it. I mean if it's all subjective
Wait, didn't didn't mythbusters actually cover whether or not a toaster in a bathtub will kill you and it actually was proven false
It seems like something they would cover
Um, but I always thought that it was like a known thing that that would definitely kill you
I thought that was like certain
Because like that's been a meme in everything for him
Like it's been in movies and I thought movies would lie to us right I would never do yeah
Yeah, I don't know. I remember watching the mythbusters and it's like it didn't I like it didn't kill
And then like something else happened that it did how do they test that then?
I'm well, you could you could measure the the voltage of liquids
Using my computers and stuff, but I and then you could see how much it takes to kill a human
I figured we knew that part
I thought that they wanted they were curious about the
They could put a baboon in the bathtub
Oh jeez, okay
Baboon balls you except maybe it might not
um
brown table son of tola tola tonaled sexual be thy harassment
Uh petition to rename the second top tier jeb like
Jeb like a jeb like weapon the griper army versus dan crenshaw to noronite watch america first with nick fuentes
nica out
I I don't I don't even know what girl. What is a griper? I can't I heard that we heard that on the stream. Is that like a
Weird zoomer thing or what?
It's something must be a collective name for somebody
I guess it doesn't match nick fuentes his name
grow
I don't know. I don't know. Maybe some of the chat. Tell me what a griper is so that when it's mentioned in the future
I know what it means
Uh, my little jab gi jab the jabinator
What makes good orphan?
Unicorns are just massive rhinos true gears five sucks because fuck women
Someone's saying oh someone's saying in the chat they found out that the drain grounded the tub
Uh grounded the water. So I think we're shocked that dummy. Oh
Oh
Does okay, man science is fucking cool, dude
That's the big game. So if you were like in a hmm interesting, is there a scenario?
What about like old-timey?
I say old-timey tubs as if they had toasters as well, but you could have an older tub
Like in a future. Yeah old tub. Yeah, you can have an old tub. That's got like the legs on the bottom
Yeah legs, you know a little bitty leg tisms
Uh
Also says the last word is censored
I guess oh what it said. Fuck women. It just says f women. No, no, it's like an in joke. The last word is
Censored. Oh, here's five stars because fuck women censored
Oh also that
Uh, if you were dating a guy or girl and it's all going great
But then you discover they have a giant porg in their bed. Do you stay or run?
Fuck the porg to assert dominance
Yeah
You know take away it's uh, it's alpha nature, you know
but they also would be like oh so uh
You like last jedi, huh?
That's cool. That's cool. Just yeah. All right. Neat neat
Well, it's it's very very possible that they hate the last jedi, but they just think that porgs are cute
We did have that super chat of the guy who said he had one of those things because he won it and he was trying
To get rid of it and couldn't so
Please someone take it away from me. Like I said, man, just burn it up. It'll be pretty cool burn it burn it
But hell say you have bush inside
Okay, yeah, always take care and check. There's not a you know
It's just the tragedy when anyone has ever shot in the head. They take the jab with them
Oh, yeah, it's really it's really a double murder every time someone shot in the head
It should they should be tried as a double murder because it's really screwed up when people die and the jabs crawl out
But you need that to happen. It's a natural thing
There's all this paper. Yeah, they live in the forest
A little jab community. Uh, also I thought it was spelt porg, but apparently that is something else entirely not intended for children. Yes
Hey molar in the tree I sent you for the last name I included every reference
Oh for the um for the the smash brothers image
Uh, I think we we probably got most of them. I imagine uh, very very good stuff
Because I didn't miss anybody and there were some that we didn't mention
But I certainly saw them all and I was legitimately impressed with not just how many there were but
A lot of the times they were if possible like thematically related to the character that their, you know, head was on
Although i'd still really like to know who was in samus's armor
Yeah, I oh, yeah, who is in samus's armor? Uh,
Because I I couldn't really see is a
Big image. It was well. Yeah, and that like the helmet visor was like really narrow too. So what we could really see is the eyes
Yeah
I was gonna say my twitch is kind of stacked right now
Uh, yeah
I will if I if I get a chance to snatch it up, I will that uh that info
Hmm, uh do
Oh, where am I so many taps? Um
Zombie land was meh go see it if you want more of the same jokes that run on too long a rushed third act
And a bill mary scene that's worth the ticket
Oh, you mean for the first one
Because uh, yeah, I thought the first one was okay. I haven't seen it. Yeah, it's fine
Haven't seen the second one. I think er is the smash logo. Perfect. Ah
I started the first episode of bat bitch. Wow, and I was so close to angrily shitting italian dressing diarrhea that I had to turn it off
Here's for your suffrage. Not yours
I imagine what that would taste like
Um
The visual came to mind as it's just sitting there in front of the
You don't want to write over a salad
You don't want to watch the show. Okay, just watch our coverage. You'll be fine. Just watch our don't watch the show
Watch us watching save yourself. Don't hit like, you know self-harm
Uh, that beautiful story rags red reminded me of a story just as beautiful called gay bigfoot a mouthful of sasquatch
I could I could I would imagine there would be some
Some similarities there. Oh, yeah, definitely
Uh, what's your opinion on watch dogs? I love the game
Oh games never played it. I never played watch dogs never played
Uh, the first watch dogs was really repetitive and stuff
The second watch dogs was actually pretty decent
The stealth was kind of garbage in the sense that once you took somebody down in a non-lethal way
You cannot move the bodies. That's a problem because the guys can see the goddamn body. So it like
Kind of almost unincentivize doing non-lethal in certain ways, but you can like slip through anyway watch dogs. It was pretty good
it was a good attempt to uh
You know make watch dogs one like less
terrible, I guess
I've played them both
Uh, so I had a dream last night wherein I experienced the same story repeatedly with the ability to make different choices and see different outcomes
Madam madon gameplay literally crept into my dream. Oh, no
I'm so sorry
Was it really that bad that that implies the choices like matter in any way most of them don't
It's more to do. I hate that one. Everyone's like, oh, yeah
Here's a choice and then the choices don't mean anything and they just lead to the same conclusion
I'm actually totally being harsher than you realize what i'm trying to say is like
When I say they matter in games like that what I mean is events actually change in this whole game
Most of it just goes the same for example
It's like hide here or run and then you choose hide and then the guy goes
And then you go. Oh my god and start running away instead of just running
You're like, yeah. Oh, yeah. Just fucking pointless
It's the same thing it's like decisions that don't like that create
That create a consequence that you couldn't have possibly seen happening. That's something that's completely irrelevant to what you did
Yeah, the best example i've got man is the uh playing with alex
He had a he was chasing after a girl who was screaming
And it said you can take the fast path or the safe path and I was like, oh, that's obviously a uh, fucking
It's practically a dog whistle for you're gonna die if you go the fast path. You're like, okay safe safe fine
Then it's like you're too slow. She's dead. You're like, oh
And then the walking if you chose fast and it died because you didn't go the safe path
What the fuck am I playing this like this sucks
Yeah, and it's it's not enough to be like fast and safe. It's like
Okay, that could go a number of ways who knows
The uh, there was a choice in the walking dead the first chapter of the game, um
Where you go to herschel's farm and spoilers who haven't played the first one, but did you find out?
Yeah, it's like
You're supposed to like either like make herschel happy or make his son happy
And then like, you know, you'll do something for herschel that says herschel
We'll remember that but no matter what you do herschel dies like like a minute later
It's like, oh cool. I can't I can't help but notice you're saying you're you say like a lot but you don't compare to things
Huh
Is that it wait what
It's right counting on the fact that you use that's great. So you use like
You say like a lot but you never compare to things
It's a strength. Oh, i'm sorry. I'm just kind of using verbal crutches. My bad
Verbal crutches rags probably knew that and he just wanted to make the joke tripling or something
Um
Also, someone said how is uh question dog whistle and I was like, oh did I use that wrong and I guess technically because it's more
More typically these days used about politics. I just meant a message that was concealed to a degree
That only uh, that's what I meant. So like a subtle push toward that's probably what I meant to say instead. Um
All trannies want are equal rights and far lefts
Huh. All right
I put mauler commander above maiden personally
More than oh, no, somebody corrected me herschel doesn't die his son dies and then just boots you off the farm and he never returns to the game
Okay
either way point
Tism and or cousins tism and or
All right, fair enough episode nine is almost upon us hashtag toxic brood unite
Hashtag toxic brood unite. Absolutely toxic broods rise up
All right, my toxic broods supple you massives just finished watching the last efap at work
It was nice seeing a fellow wolf returned to efap also high rags and kicked you. Hello. Hey got in the correct order
Yeah, I kicked you thumb wars nine the thighs of sky skipper
Okay, the thighs a sky skipper sky skipper rags rambunctiously rescues romanians rushing russia
None
The enemy of my enemy howdy all question is a channel trailer good to have if so
Should I do an accent or would that end up being misleading?
Also high rags an accident. Oh, I don't know why you would do an accent. I don't see the need
Yeah, I don't know. I I mean, I obviously everyone has an accent, but I don't know why you would do an accent
Assuming it's not your at all
Yeah, unless you were doing a really specific bit
But then the point of the channel trailers is to show what the channel is all about, right?
All the channel is about being a character of some kind I guess
yeah, would you be
playing a character or doing some kind of a joke or
If you're just doing standard good old-fashioned you're doing x content and you just keep the voice the same should be fine
Really framed it made it seem like it would do something out of the ordinary like make an accent and then just never do it
Again in the other videos. So it's like well. No, I don't see the point
Uh, can we get jay to do a fireside reading of all efap memes and lore behind them have him dress up in a house coat
monocle and pipe buy wags
Goodbye
um, I mean, I think he'd be on board with that if he if he goes through the
The lore and behind the meme section of the efap website and just explains the history
While holding a book
Yeah, maula. Can I still like the godzilla king and the monsters? It's okay
No, yeah, you can still like it but it's not okay. It's terrible. It's not okay
Um still like it though. Don't worry. Has rag seen the patricia taxon video on him. If so, is he planning a response?
Response may be on efap, but like all in a long time. It's not worth
anything really
yeah, I think um
Nobody so like with the tiara video we had a portion of the community telling us over and over again
You know, do you have a response for these claims like the
Arguments, you're not really addressing it and it was always just like okay fine
We will we finally did and then it was like why did you guys think this had any fucking credibility at all?
And I think because of that and the jack st
Video that we we are becoming less and less required for for people to see our response. They can watch the video be like, okay
Yeah
Just I mean i've said this before but the biggest bane toward a lot of these video essays that efap
Provides as we listen to them. It's like whoa
Because a lot of people watch videos on youtube these days while doing something else and that's totally okay
But a lot of the time you miss what people are saying
When you stretch them out sentence by sentence you get stuff like is the theme of this movie that people shouldn't take medication
And your eyes widen like wow
Uh
Mola look at jenny's video again. It has people from your previous stream and they're shattering her glass house argument about joker
um
People are going to comment on it
She has a huge audience. So probably not that noticeable, but you know be nice
it's
jebby nickels like
Was silly said silly things. She's not bright, but she's not like evil. So just don't worry about it
Yeah, don't don't harass. It's like within a lot of the names. Yeah, don't harass just let it tism in peace
but you're welcome to obviously disagree with her and provide a counter argument or say you didn't like the video and everything just uh
Don't be throwing insults. That's the
It's the last thing you need because then you get screen shotted quoted and you'll be you'll be
See this is what maulers fans do and that comes back on us
The last thing you need to do is be like those efap people fucking oh
Uh, the copyright violations it's over nine thousand man. You went with that instead of 1.2 billion really
Yeah, I was about to say damn. We have our own means. We don't need nine thousand
More and now the stream has a goofy pause in the middle of the efap stream because of the violation
I mean, I don't know what usually they stitch them back together. So hopefully it's uh,
So a violation did happen two of them
Ooh, the stream got paused twice. I don't know exactly what damage that's gonna do in post
Um, the previous efap is ready to go up. I'll probably put it up as soon as this one's done
This one might be delayed to say the least
Uh, how's uh, where are we going here?
Thanos used the reality stone to bring back the stream. Oh, that's kind of him. It's nice
YouTube being massive true
Uh
I'm laying down on my couch watching efap and all of a sudden it's suspended and I swear to the cosmic chicken
I was about to build a roof just for youtube if the stream didn't come back online
Don't worry he'll stay for a while 10 hours later yep
Completely innocent question will telling youtube that efap is a five star content have negative content consequences for you
no idea when you when you're asked to rate streams or
I don't know what the fuck that does. I don't know if it does anything
YouTube are
More than likely having it just for interaction stuff. I don't know if they actually look at it. But um
Do whatever you want
I doubt they look at it
Yeah, anyways, thanks for sharing many fun memes. Have a great week. Don't bless. Thank you very much. Don't bless
Don't bless. Oh don't bless. Do you do?
Why not have the people who create these memes pause every few seconds in their actual videos?
I mean
I don't think they're gonna want to do that. But yeah, it's just when you make a meme
Please be aware that if you use copyrighted material, we can't play it on stream and it's not that we don't appreciate it
But by now we are kind of hoping that you understand that
Yeah, I mean honestly as everyone's fully aware after those two suspensions. We're very concerned now
This is the closest we've come to having efap being knocked off completely and
We don't want that. I don't think you guys want it either
Um, so do what you can. Um
What is this the gorka podcast four minute breaks?
Um, I don't know. I hope not youtube violation, huh? Ra get the roof
People really need that roof
After watching rlm's dark fate review. I realized that they are efap
They are efap will be another 15 years of suffering and cynicism continued in part two
Uh
Part two red. Let me just auto separates the beloved original film
Films of franchises from what comes nowadays. That's why they tolerate the rubbish more
So i've seen the first half of their dark fate one. I thought it was really interesting that jay said something like, um
You can either judge this as a film or as a sequel to terminator two
And i was like it is a sequel to terminator two. Yeah, so it's kind of a strange film
How do you judge the film without this terminator one and two when the film relies on all the information of terminator one and two?
Especially when it starts with like the two characters
like
Uh
Like i'm not saying you can't like it's not possible you can totally do it
But I don't understand how you can make comments about plot when you're missing several pieces of key information
And you assume a lot like it's weird to me
It is strange that is a very strange good luck judging rise of skywalker as a film on its own that's gonna be garbage
Like don't consider episodes one two three four five six seven eight nine well, yeah don't even consider itself
um
Gets copyrighted for grade a under a for style. That was the paint video
Um, I have to think this takedown thing is new because when I uploaded the doctor who meme it didn't show claimed material until the last minute
Sorry to put y'all at risk though. Yeah again, man. It's okay. I don't think anybody intends for this to happen
It's just youtube being tismy or at least yeah
the people who
Re at youtube as in like bbc and whoever else zephyr and stuff
Mm-hmm. Uh, this is for jay. I think he's cute
Oh
There you go. Jay
Yeah, you left before you could say that
Good night. Jay. Good work. Sleep. Well, we'll most likely kick you in the morning. Oh
Jay is the apex bundle of sticks
Thank you so much for featuring my video love making y'all laugh bonus memes for any masses that translate he said love making
translate the greek
Translate the greek, you know, did he say something to you? Oh it was um
Um
I was the the one the the what makes good rat. I think you mean at the very end. Yeah, I think so
No, that was the japanese at the very end. Oh, right. Yeah. Uh, well either way there was there was some greek in there
All right. There was definitely greek. I
But yeah, man. I I just i'm gonna rely on you to have translated it properly
I yes, i'm not good with my greek a little bit rusty. Honestly
It's all greek to me. Mm-hmm
Uh
Das well played make an efap meme using your bobby will never be mlg video but replace peggy hill at the end with jay
Since you uh, since he left before you got back
I get it. Nobody else does but I do I give it a thumbs up if you get it. I agree
I know there's thumbs in the middle
It's godzilla's birthday acknowledge this
Happy birthday godzilla
I hope your next film isn't shit. You did it. Please don't kill me. You're older. You did it
You're the king of the mansters
Uh sounds like you need to step up your game with him maula metal has high standards for a flop dingus apparently
I did everything I could what can I say?
He's an alien even all of the alcohols and he still wasn't satisfied. Yeah, I was hacked. Sorry. He was hacked
Um, oh hi das. You missed the shad man shader man
Shader man, I think
And rag wolfs and rag wolfs
Oh, hello i'm part of rag wolfs
Missed the live reaction to my drawing, but I want to thank you guys for all the work you do ps
Thoughts on angel's egg if any of you have seen it
Who angels don't know what that is?
No, I I don't know what that is. Yeah
is that like
Angel is angel the show and like an egg is like a plot device or something
I don't know. That is not heard of it though
Passion of the jeb angel in chains or nirvana. I don't listen to either
Maybe he meant say alice. Was it is it supposed to be like alice and change? Oh alice and change
You said angel in my bad alice and chains on nirvana, yes
Yeah, um, I don't know anything about alice and chains
I don't know anything about alice and chains and i'm just sick to goddamn death in nirvana because back in seattle
Like they would play smells like teen spirit at least 10 times a day on the radio and i'm just so goddamn done with it
Anyway, but that's just my but that's just my angel's egg is an anime movie apparently
I have no idea never heard of that
Star Wars that star wars guild is samus in that image and oh
Okay, uh, they they're looking for a link to the isle of man meme cartoon video
Uh, so whenever we look at the videos, you can see their names in the top left
Uh, so that'll be a quickest route though. I will link uh, that one in the description with the other two, I guess. Um
Like I said that you can always find them through their names
um
If I can have a look quickly see what the name of it is
It's called maula succumbs to the leg and the channel is bad mems
Bad men's spelt m ems
Normally, I just let this go but given the time that went into the original
I think i'll make an altered cut for the meme that you might be able to show
um
Yeah, man, like uh, we let me know like on twitter and like I said, we'll try i'll try and collect up a bunch
That'll have to be done for an efap mini
And uh, we can just do some editing
Yes goliath saga 2 will be 95 to 100
Copyright free audio as well as the footage being very re-edited. So that should help the copyright situation. That's from meme repository
Good shit fat wait, what the fuck youtube does uh, just block random combinations of words
Well, it's weird because some people were saying fat just to test it and it went through
Maybe it's just not for super chats
Maybe it's like algorithms or shit
The theory now is that it's that weird plus another word or something or in the right order in some way
Yeah, it must be something
I just said it just now. No, you didn't
Oh
Damn, that's phat is different
Oh
Pat hello fellows. Have you considered playing the forest for efap gaming?
I have played the forest, uh quite a bit and I enjoyed it. I have too. I completed it
I had actually played it while it wasn't finished yet
And then they released an update to where it had like a finished storyline. There's a storyline in that game
It's kind of cool. I haven't played it in a while. I need to go back. Take a look. I know
What a consideration. I I kind of like that idea to be honest with you. Uh, yeah
The score e-sports was the okay sign is not okay vid
Oh, so oh I remember that yeah
Yeah
That happened guys
That was a thing the okay sign is not okay. There are people who think that the okay sign means you're
Racist and you're a white supremacist. That's the world we live in. It's like of course
You know a green frog is racist. Like I understand that but okay sign. Okay
Nope you're a racist you hate black people if you play the circle game, isn't that nuts?
It's like you got you got the sign that's been around forever
But suddenly you're just gonna hand it over to the so-called white supremacists. Just oh if they use a gesture
Just give it to them. Yeah, like yeah, not way to not give in
Supremacist start drinking water a lot publicly you guys will be great. Oh, uh, they said about milk
I guess you don't want healthy bones then. Fuck you. That's white supremacy talking white supremacy
um
And yeah about the whole fat thing. I think there's the rules for super chats and chat are different like, uh,
I don't know what
There is but there's some kind of difference
Um, I can hear everyone do. Oh wait, can I hear everyone do a fake laugh? Good old good and bad
so
So like oh who goes first?
Left to right mauler can be first
Uh, that's like right to left. Okay, fine. I mean for people watching oh, I guess. Oh, yeah
I guess it's different for everyone. Yeah
Fine i'll go so like it says good and bad. So like a good fake laugh is a bad. What would that mean like believable?
Yeah, the best fake laugh you can do and like a clearly fake laugh. So the clearly fake won't be like
Almost sarcastic
It's like straddling the line, you know, like oof
then a a fake laugh
That I can you can generate without actually laughing and be like
You need to like hopefully no one actually paid attention to that because I didn't really try that sort of that sort of
I would have thought the exact same thing. Did you just did?
Yeah
Just like yeah
Yeah, anyone else want to do their takes
Next up is dash. Bullshit
Oh, okay
Um, so the fake laugh
That was pretty bad, right
You get a lot of breath that's something I noticed too
I'm not trying to stall but I noticed I like a lot of actors have trouble with laughing and coughing
It's like none of them like so few of them can get it right. All right, so let me try, uh to
Do them do something real here?
All right, there you go, I mean the goal with the good fake laugh is probably to make us all go was that real
Was that fake? Yeah, like that's the sort of yeah
And you'd think that with mauler and myself especially you'd have plenty of
laugh laughins
But I get i'm next up on the list except for my fake laugh
We could do a
Like tightest from final fantasy 10
And then I guess for a real laugh, let me see sorry, let me take some more beer
Were you taking it?
Right at the butt the beer in a beer enema goes in faster. Yeah, and it goes it gets into the blood system quicker
Is that how that's how it works, all right, let me say I guess I was gonna real laugh
And see I think that we're nailing it because all these last
You do like the the eyes where you like sort of squint and you're like was that you
Well, yeah, that's the thing with in when you you can see people laugh you can like a real laugh your eyes
Squint together and your cheeks curl up and you know, you
But when it's just sound it's a lot easier to hide when it's sound
Sound only audio only that leaves metal belch
I mean I already did the the tightest one was like ha ha ha
Yeah, but now you get this a really bad one. You'd actually do that. Oh, no
That's your real last before study is uh, yeah
It's like so no one
You know what we should do you finish up your thing and then I have a suggestion for us I think okay
Do you yeah, he's done. Yeah

So wait a minute, huh?
You know, well, we've watched spider wars for ages or spootables
And for some reason this is the first one where it was like, all right, I guess it was the music in the background

Let's see star was nine c3po anthony daniels reveals his disappointment with the new films
Um
Daniel says oh wait, i'm not sure how i'm supposed to read this exactly
The actor says well, yes, I do understand why the fans are unhappy
It speaks to a devotion that they care so much that they mind if someone messes with it
I understand people being critical of the films. He has remained fairly silent until now
While stars like mark hamill have dropped loaded comments online and in interviews
um
Daniel says I know it's been particularly difficult for him in relation to hamill lately because the new movies haven't given him much to do
I certainly recognize that and can relate to it in these new movies
I felt like a table decoration
That is difficult because I recognize this character c3po is with so much more
But I understand it is a whole film not a feature about c3po
That is just my personal disappointment. I get paid whether or not he does anything
It would be nice for him to have a purpose oh bad
And then there's links for all takes from people
Uh shitting on him basically in response, I think
Lots of people saying I hope he dies
Uh the the character I mean c3po
Oh, okay. Um, he got one saying when was c3po more than a talking prop c3po was a full-on character
Yeah
Well, he's not really in the sequel trilogy like i'm trying to remember he's just he just spouts off a random singular line
per every like
half a film
Um
Jeb nickels has responded saying excuse my two cents
But if old actors can't play ball about not being the main character, they should leave the ball and go home
Yeah, it was a good thing to say jeb
Run faster, dude. Yeah, it's slowing down
Can't wait for ben to kill that golden boomer
Wow
Wow, what he said wasn't even controversial like it was
Let's go back to ignoring the ot cast and shitty men y'all please bring peace back to my timeline
Okay
I bet that's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna freaking kill him, too
They've killed every other original character at this point
Just fuck all the old things the new things are way better. You guys like the new stuff better, right?
To hell with that old shit. So it was literally tweeted a gun pointed at old white men
