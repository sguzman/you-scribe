Not before.
Being alive sounds like something a racist would do.
I knew it.
Are you saying that we need more dead racists?
More dead racists.
Wouldn't we lose half the left wing at that point?
Damn it.
The left wing, we have the right.
Everyone knows they're all a bunch of racists.
Mm-hmm.
You look jab alone.
I think you lose a fair amount of a lot of ideologies.
It's ideologies idiot.
No, all the racists are specifically on the one side that isn't me.
That isn't me.
Look, this is me side.
This is me.
Side me.
Double whammy back-to-back efap.
Yes.
We have some memes to shleem.
What memes?
We have a big stream.
We're gonna go over all the memes.
We're gonna laugh.
We're gonna cry together as a family because that's what this meme stream is all about.
It's family.
It's about family and that's what's so powerful about it.
Mm-hmm.
Formalore.
Sure.
Okay, I'm sorry.
So, how's everyone doing?
You're all right?
Doing all right.
Doing doing pretty okey-dokes.
I mean, almost for my first drink.
We didn't we didn't really talk about how bad it is, but Spooktober is over.
Like, Spooktober is a shit Spooktober.
I moved to make this November a sequel to Spooktober.
It's no not November, which is kind of spooky.
The thing is, it'll start to bleed into, you know, Christmas-tober and we can't remember.
No, not Christmas.
Also means I am back home now.
Nude.
Which means you'll be streaming again.
That is true.
We got so much done while you were here.
We drank.
And watch movies.
Um, do we do we mention drinking already?
No, no, I think we should probably.
Oh, we had some drinks.
Yeah, and and and so many things so many things are all rearing to come out.
Batwoman episode 5 is coming out any any time now as in the actual episode.
We haven't seen it yet.
Yeah, obviously very excited about that.
I anticipated more than I anticipated episode 6 of Game of Thrones.
So season 8.
Oh my goodness.
Moira and Mel no longer sleeping in the same bad cry phase.
Yeah, we got us a meme stream with a meme cast, which means all the people here are basically like, they're so silly.
They're barely human.
Why watch your stream for peace?
I'm gonna stream tomorrow again.
I'm sorry.
I thought we would start this earlier.
Yeah, you could have streamed today.
What the fuck?
Idiot.
Yeah, you could have.
Why didn't you?
Because I thought I had an appointment at 8 o'clock.
With who?
Why would anyone who did this?
That's my answer.
It sounded a bit like peeing.
TLJ is in the critically acclaimed films category on Netflix.
Well, it was critically acclaimed.
My point was immediately gonna be, why does anyone care what Netflix thinks about a list called critically acclaimed films?
Like, that's just...
Netflix is making two seasons of another life.
See, Netflix can't be trusted.
They really can't.
Not after they canceled Daredevil.
Well, they canceled Daredevil.
They keep Batwoman and another life going.
That seems like, that seems right to me.
Obviously, it wouldn't be if we weren't in Clan World, but that's where we're at.
So, stop complaining, guys.
Geez.
Besides, we still have Batwoman.
That's what's important.
Yeah.
It's about Batwoman, and that's what makes it really special.
I'm a Batwoman.
Batwoman's great.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the show we needed.
It's the show we didn't deserve, but the one we got.
Batwoman was sent down to punish us for our sins.
So, as a continuation from the previous stream, I have been made aware of the Reddit thread
regarding that Star Wars girl and Batwoman.
Which Star Wars girl?
That Star Wars girl.
That one.
So, we can have a gander at this.
It is titled,
This has to be the worst review I've ever seen.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
Is that what Anna looks like?
Is that her?
Yeah, that's Anna.
Oh, okay.
I just like the comment.
She has no knowledge of literature whatsoever.
So, why is this in the Batwoman subreddit?
Is it because she's reviewing Batwoman?
Yes.
So, to see her review is Batwoman review.
What the hell is CW thinking?
Which is a fair...
So, the defenders of Batwoman on the Batwoman subreddit.
They're upset that that...
What a strange thing to say.
They're upset that that Star Wars girl is negatively reviewing Batwoman.
Yes.
I'm sorry, you need to have a high understanding of literature to understand that.
But yeah, just to, you know, add to it.
She comes off as homophobic.
That's interesting.
Along with all that, she clearly didn't actually watch the show.
At most, she read a brief summary.
Oh, she's like Jenny Nicholson then.
Well, sorry.
I think that a brief summary of the episode.
That's what a show...
Each show is a brief summary stretched out into an episode.
Yeah.
They don't flesh things out.
Things just happen.
People really go out of their way to bring the show down.
You do not have to go out of your own way.
You just need to watch the episode if that was brought down.
Well, that's what going out of your way is.
If you watch it, it wasn't made for you.
So, you're going out of your way to watch something you know is terrible.
You're like, I watched the episode.
I didn't think it was good.
So, I was like, why would you go out of your own way?
Yeah.
Why would you go out of your own way as if that's even possible as a concept to go out of your own way?
I think kind of watching that woman counts as going out of your way.
Did you miss the past two minutes of conversation?
Quite possibly.
I wasn't focusing on it.
B ad rags been making jokes about that for ages that you just cut it.
I was looking through the thread.
I will admit, I was looking through the thread and reading what was on it.
And then thought, I'll enter back into the conversation now.
The jib inside your head has clearly fallen out of his wheel.
The jib in your head.
Your head jib is confused right now.
He's trying to file everything.
See, I'm curious about what she has to say.
So, I jumped around a spot.
She's really bitching about how Batman didn't save Kate's family.
I'm sorry.
That's so integral to the whole thing.
It's what everything is based on.
But yeah.
Did she tune out at the part where Batman thought he secured the car so he
could save the busload of children?
So, is that what he did?
Well, this is the thing when we were watching it.
That was the best faith interpretation I had.
But the contention for everyone is, wow, Batman fucked that up.
He fucked up like the what his grappling hook could hold.
That seems like Batman.
Just a real simple thing.
But then when that woman throws a batarang and it misses, that's the
batarang's fault.
That's the batarang's fault.
Exactly.
It wasn't calibrated for me.
God, this batarang wasn't calibrated for my short woman arms.
Therefore, that is why I missed.
It wasn't because I fucked up.
What are you calibrating a fucking batarang anyways?
With science.
Oh, thank you.
I know I could come to you.
So, you got jumped to another random part.
She's bitching about why they took Sophie for whatever reason.
She clearly tuned out of the part where Jacob sees her as a better daughter
and attempted to kill her because Alice knew it would piss off Jacob.
Fine.
So in later episodes, we know that she shouldn't have anything against
Jacob, though.
That's the thing.
Well, this, yeah, so this is the rest.
There's other problems you can generate from this for sure.
But like I will admit when you watch episode one, it does seem kind of
random that they go for a fuck.
What's her name?
Ex-girlfriend person.
Yeah.
The like like she remember the whole they just plaid the thing where
she's going to fucking fall off the thing and land on like a trampoline
that they capture.
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, what and then you're like, oh, so it's very
important that Alice kill her because she's, you know, going against
like Jacob.
It's like, well, she fails miserably to kill her.
She doesn't really do a good job.
And she sort of let her go in the next three episodes.
Not really kind of not really.
I mean, like, you know who this person is.
You know where they live.
And again, just highlighting how awful of a villain Alice is like Alice
is aware that the stepmother has forged documents in order to convince
everybody that Alice was dead and she blames Batwoman and Jacob for
that.
Yeah, they blame the she blames more the people for believing the lie
instead of the person who lies.
And then she wants to kill Sophie.
She is a vengeful guy.
She sees her as a daughter like, wow, all right then.
Hey, listen, maybe there will come a time in the show where Jacob kind
of gives that impression once.
I think in the first episode, he's nice to her at some point.
There you go.
Yeah, he's sort of nice to her.
I guess.
That's like a daughter like Mahler.
I just I've always wanted to say Molly you you've just like always
been a daughter to me.
Oh, I've always sensed that the daughter father relationship we
have. I really can't understand why the show gets so much hate.
I didn't know that this is really bad.
All right, if these people if these people who complain and hate it
justify their opinion that it's bad just because it's bad.
Clearly, they haven't watched the other Arovis shows.
Oh, that's yeah, that's saying other things are also shit.
That's not saying your things good.
Does that statement obviously read as they say it's bad, which is
stupid because everything else is bad.
If anything, you're just saying things are consistently shit.
This is the exact same thing the TLJ defenders say.
Oh, yeah.
Well in the original trilogy.
Okay, even if that was true, that wouldn't I was going to make
your show.
The other CW shows may very well be bad.
Why would that mean the show isn't bad?
There's more shows than just the CW shows that get goes further.
Okay.
No, there are no if you like Batwoman your universe is watching
the CW shows and Batwoman is in no way worse than them.
It's like, okay.
You know what?
I believe that considering the clips of Superwoman.
I've yeah, well, I assume Arrow is best out of all of them.
It's either Arrow or Flash.
I remember you'll talk about that.
But I know that Superwoman is garbage.
I've heard Flash is the best.
I think yeah, we wouldn't know.
We don't want to know.
We are doing the unthinkable and judging something on its own
merits.
Look at this on the contrary at the moment.
The show is fresh and new and has a better atmosphere.
Sorry has better atmosphere and stories than Arrow for example.
Oh, no, Arrow.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no.
She's just it's a new by the way fresh and new just means,
you know, woohoo.
I've definitely never seen anything like Batwoman.
That is true.
Isn't the flash on Netflix right now?
I don't know.
Is this a different flash on the flash Batwoman?
Oh, look at this.
So clearly the show gets so much hate because it's about a lesbian
woman.
Yeah.
Where is that?
There's always one down.
But if someone actually watched the show, they will see that she
doesn't disrespect Batman.
Yes, he does.
Oh, man.
It was a first of all here right now.
He would fucking flabber.
But secondly, yes, he does.
Batman.
She doesn't disrespect Batman.
No, she doesn't disrespects.
Oh, no, I thought it was Spatman.
Spatman.
I'm the Spatman.
She doesn't want to take his place or claim she's better than
him.
She literally.
Oh, this came out before this came out before that was said.
Oh, my goodness.
That's why people like this show.
That's an age.
Well,
I'm not the same Batman.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better.
Maybe I'm better with Batman.
This show doesn't have any agenda.
Yeah, it just tells the story.
Sorry.
It just tell the story of a superhero who happens to be a gay
woman.
I don't think that's.
Man.
That's all that's all it is.
Is it just a comment that just says watch the fap biddies?
I was about to say that.
Yeah.
Like we've got a moment where she says I'm gonna be better
than Batman and then that comment is like she's not trying
to be better than Batman.
Okay.
I'm curious if on YouTube or someplace we could get our
hands on somebody like live reviewing our minis or something
or doing a response to our minis.
Oh, do you mean like someone who disagrees with us?
Like people who disagree with our our mini our reactions to
it as we watch the show.
Now you've said that you might encourage people to do it
in like a fake way.
Let's hope that we don't be able to tell we can sniff this
sort of thing through.
Yeah, we usually vet a little bit before we just throw on
a video.
So oh, yeah, we'll be fine.
By the way, anybody who hasn't seen the Jay Longbone reviews
of the they're great.
Please do make an effort to watch them.
They're great.
Yeah, you shouldn't just watch one person's review of these
film video things because they're so terrible.
Like one person is not going to catch everything that's wrong
with them.
And I mean that I'm serious.
Like there are things that Jay Longbone says and Thorius
Unlimited say that we just don't catch we legitimately just
missed it because there's so much.
The reviews are awful and generally politically motivated.
Ours really aren't we?
I'm part of yes.
I'm part of the good show party.
Yes, we advocate for consistency in the in the eFap party.
Yeah, we refuse were politically motivated.
Wouldn't they say it was good like mainstream reviewers
politically motivated.
That's the kind of thing that they like.
Well, they were they're addressing people like Anna and
they assume Anna hates lesbians.
I guess politically something.
I don't really know.
It's not as opposed to morally.
I have a political hatred of lesbians.
It's not like stop having rights.
It's political.
I hate the lesbian party.
So I saw a bit of one of the one you show here.
She complains that things that could have been dragged out
for a whole season are resolved in first two episodes.
Some of her words repeating this idea were don't drop every
single bomb in the first episode.
You could really drag this out.
You could have dragged this out for a whole season.
Like that's a problem that the show gets to the point too
much.
What you're looking for is rush.
Yeah, the show gets to the point too much.
That's what they conclude for me say that it's almost too
well for all of a sudden we have we need to have our we
need to respect the time.
Listen, the time of the people who enjoy Batwoman.
It's very valuable.
They're doing it.
They're doing very important things.
Otherwise, all right.
I like that.
I get your point, but I think that this drama about Kate and
her family.
Most people are just confused because they haven't had a lot
of time to care yet.
Like if Darth Vader told Luke is his father 30 minutes into
a new hope it wouldn't work as well.
Yeah, it wouldn't.
That's one of our memers.
Yeah, it's just like by the way, have you ever considered
that's why that wasn't done?
Like yes, you're going to care about people.
The whole story should be five minutes.
It would get to the point better.
It would don't post these idiots and give them extra publicity
of views.
Don't challenge my thoughts as if any of these people actually
watched it.
Like any of these people actually want to watch the review.
No, it's the top the top things on the thread say I skipped
around after half.
I only skipped the two random parts like great.
Yeah, go away.
Genuine guess 60% didn't watch it.
30% watch portions 10% if we're lucky watch the video.
I think there's probably yeah, I'm being really generous.
I don't think the show is good yet, but I have watched each
episode to criticize it without completely watching the episodes
is not fair.
You can criticize episodes.
Yeah, individual episodes can absolutely be criticized and
I would be curious to the if this person could let us know
beforehand how many episodes we need to watch before we're
able to reach a conclusion just so we know when we get there.
So it's not a constant moving the goal post of oh, no, you
have to watch more.
Oh, no, no, no, it wasn't.
If you have to watch more really not to mention it's all
like our later episodes really going to fix what happened to
the previous ones.
Like are the effects just suddenly not bad anymore in like
the previous episodes and so on.
Yeah, because it's revealed.
It was all faked by mysterious say, for example, we were
tasked with writing the rest of it.
There are fixes we could try and apply.
We could try but but you know, there's something you could
do to try and make it better.
But let's say for example, I was tasked with writing the
remaining 14 episodes.
I'd be like the season still gonna be bad overall.
There's no way I'm gonna be able to do anything about that.
It's hard to come back from some of this stuff.
What's happened happened.
We can do our best to flesh out relationships and back story.
Obviously, I'm discounting the idea of having to wake up and
go.
Whoa.
What are the crazy long dream?
Okay.
Yeah, I dreamt.
I was bad girl.
Well back to school and back to school.
Why do you give them all publicity?
You do realize that you're basically encouraging more people
to watch her video and give and given she probably makes money
from ads based on the view of using a video and the response
for the poster is I never told anyone to watch it.
Jesus Christ.
How dense can it be?
Apparently there's a crossover already between that one
and Arrow.
Yeah, there's like and what is it the the extroverse or?
The extroverts the extrovert.
The extrovert extroverts unite.
People who have no knowledge in literature have no place to
make a review reviews are supposed to be unbiased given
with knowledge.
Wow.
This is neither knowledgeable nor read like me.
I don't mind watching a review that is biased, especially if
that's the fucking point like if they're like, we're going
to be looking at this from the perspective of but if you
like, you know, this is what it is and you're clearly biased.
That's a problem.
But the idea that you can't have any bias kind of weird.
That's that's like the full opposite of Quentin's take of
like a review is just a description of an experience and
it's wrong for like the exact well, no the same reason.
It's like it can be this video is like going to the doctor
who's never been to med school.
What it's not how this works.
No, that's not that's not not a very good analogy.
A doctor who's never been to med school can still accurately
diagnose and cure you.
Yeah, you can still be an amazing doctor.
It's about level of trust and accountability.
It's not about this.
It's not about ensuring right?
Not to mention it's like it makes it sound like she's trying
to say.
Oh this person didn't spend seven years in school to learn
how to watch movies to learn how to criticize Batwoman.
I definitely did.
There's a comment that says what about people that did watch
it and didn't like it and then you got the responses that
if they can leave a valid response as to why then, you
know, that's fair enough or whatever and so we'll just respond
it with what we're reacting to Batwoman season.
What episode?
Why do you fat bit it?
There you go.
Yeah.
I don't know man.
Like the they really don't like people shitting on the show.
It makes sense.
They're a community of Batwoman.
I can't believe a community formed around that show.
That's saying that's a real thing.
I imagine it's a community that's like already just like
bleeding over from the other shows.
Maybe yeah, I like because my conclusion on a lot of this
is just like, you know, you know, like TLJ you can get a
lot of like rationalization and I'm just like so how bad
does the show have to be before it has zero fans and I
don't think it's just not possible, right?
There's always going to be someone who likes something.
Yeah, that's where we're at.
Well, that was fun.
That was great.
I agree with everything that was said.
That stars goes in chat as well.
Yeah, we found the thread.
That was a very fun read.
Keep this off.
Go for it.
It's funny.
Remember if they post about you, you're you're essentially
Um, so next up we've got the well, I was going to give you
guys a link to this, but there's no point because obviously
I'm doing it on screen, but you can play along.
I suppose make your own tears as we're doing it, but this
is supposed to be a tier list of efap villains.
Unfortunately, Jeb Nichols is not in here.
So I don't know if we can like quickly make one or something,
but we can head Canada.
Yeah, I don't actually recognize all of these icons.
I might do after we just discuss them for a little bit,
but I'm almost feeling like is this it?
Is this all the people we've covered because we need to improve
like, you know, it can't be all the people that have been
covered on efap.
I guess it's just the prominent ones.
I don't know.
Mem- most memorable.
Yeah, Jay's in there as well.
Jay or defap villain, how's that feel?
Beautiful.
So this first tier list, well, I was going to say we'll do
two and one will be tearing them for the meme ability and
the other one will be tearing them for like quality in terms
of a content creator.
And I suppose the rule will have to be overall versus the
video we covered because that's not going to apply very
easily with a lot of these people if we've covered more
than one video and also if we've watched them separately.
So and you know, we can have a look at chat, see what they
think as well.
But which one would you guys want to do first, I guess?
Well, memes, I think.
So hold on a minute.
This is this it ranks them to who's the most evil to who's
the least evil.
I suppose.
Well, so the two, do you hear anything?
I see Ally up there and now I'm confused.
Oh, ignore those.
I'm going to change them to S plus and then god-like.
I already know who's going in god-like.
Yeah, me too.
Alright, one day.
Yeah.
So it's just like I said, degree of either quality of meme
ability, which one do you want to do first?
Memes wallet.
Let's do.
Yeah, we can start off with meme ability.
Get us in the main mood.
So we'll use kind of say low tier meme ability.
Yeah, somewhere in the middle ish middle low.
He's reasonably meme-able.
I'd say C.
What really it's like we know because D is the worst right
the absolute worst, but we did get the whole I fucking hate
Trump thing out of them.
And ragged.
Oh, that was him.
Yeah, and also that's just fan stuff narrative tripling.
Was that same video?
I think he's in a at least I thought narrative tripling was
so sorry narrative tripling goes to TRO rather than him.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I think I think I think B.
I see your B with B was okay.
Well, I almost feel like let now the the overton window, right?
I if they were in grade school because there's not an F.
So we have to boost that up or D is the lowest we can shoot.
Maybe we can come back to him later after we after we filter in
some of the end of the list.
All right.
So I would if I'm making a vote now, I would say he's B.
So while we haven't had many memes out of him, the ones that
we do have are pretty powerful stuff and long-lasting.
I don't know.
I feel like a lot of the memes we get from him.
We don't reference all that much.
Maybe the Trump one is the most popular rags is one of the
most way.
He wasn't necessarily him, right?
That's a combo.
That's a lot of people a lot of people don't know how to
pluralize things that end in S apparently.
He shares that with TRO or it might actually go strictly
the TRO.
I'm not 100% sure on that.
But we'll like I said, we'll put it at the end of the list
and we'll figure it out as we go along.
So Patrick Willems, I'm going to drop that to begin with and
then we'll figure it out.
So Patrick Willems.
We've got I say I would say that Patrick Williams.
Well, let's see.
He is a meme.
Our space wizard meant for children thing.
I was going to say there's not a lot of memes associated with
him, is there?
Yeah, watching a lot of dumb stuff.
It's a meme himself though.
Those aren't like memes per se, not in the sense like they're
just dumb stuff.
He said it's different than memes.
I would I would argue.
I do agree that he is essentially a meme.
I do agree with that.
But what does that mean for the monster?
It's my favorite.
Yeah, but he's not a meme because he says meanie things
so much as he says stupid shit.
Yeah, that's what makes him a meme.
I don't think that like all I don't think memes are the
same quite the same like he is a he is a meme.
We say that as a meme, but he hasn't really said a lot of
stuff that I think is meanie.
But all of our all the people in the audience use second
language is English.
I'm so sorry.
You're watching movies wrong.
Yeah, that was quite a thing.
I would I was it's intended for children.
That was him original fine with B.
I'm fine with B for Patrick Willems.
I'm okay.
He was chat.
What's your favorite Patrick Willems quote?
It's going to be hardly any means.
I swear to chat.
It's your job whenever we come up with one of these to
start throwing memes at us.
We remember them.
Okay, that's that your interaction.
You'll you'll remind us you need your help so you can
throw in any note.
What are you okay?
He said that space titty aliens were his favorite addition
to Star Wars.
Say that I still think B though, I don't matter.
He's he's up against a lot of competition here.
So I think there's I think we're going to have a lot of
B AB and C tier guys.
I'm happy to leave him in B for now.
Yeah, I think B is 1.2.
Bill, you know, no, he's there.
We'll get to you.
We'll get there.
Yeah, so this is the man who made the the only one we
covered was him saying that a Infinity War equates love
with abuse.
I would honestly put him he's possibly our D like I don't
think we even mean.
Yeah, I think he's D.
We didn't get any memes from that.
I don't know.
He wrote alien colonial Marines.
Oh, he did.
Oh, how does that factor in?
Yeah, I think that puts him up to a C.
I think that that's like, you know, one mention that boost
him a little is what you might say D would just be there
are no memes based on them.
And then C is like, you know, maybe if we can have something
Is there anybody who hasn't had a meme about them?
Well, we've managed a few years.
No, no, because he said he can't you have to remember seven
people's names.
Oh, yeah, cinema wins.
This is it will wait.
Hang on.
We'll get there.
All right.
We'll leave is everyone.
Okay with C for film.
I'm C for film joy.
If anything, the fact that he wrote aliens colonial Maria,
that's quite a bit out of the bottom list, even if it's only
well, I think it should count because we did efap that game
on efap gaming.
So videos from that game.
Oh, man.
So Jay is next.
Jay, I'd say Jay is ally or S.
We got no, so I've changed it to me and we've got no ally
category.
What?
Oh, we don't know how I changed it to SS plus Godlike.
Well, there's no reason not to farm rhinos.
This is so I need to rename.
Oh, as a as I will change that to S plus.
All right, do that.
If you read it upwards, it says ass Godlike.
Nice or Godlike.
Yes.
Saba, just good.
I'm happy with honestly, my first guess would be as plus.
I think we're looking at a pretty strong name material here.
Some of the some of the strongest memes have been generated
from this creature.
Yeah, that I genuinely feel like this is an achievement.
So we have mom, he he we got good memes from him
that when we first covered him and he continues to be
a source of me amusement.
So I would say I would say he's up there.
S plus or S one of those two S plus probably I would say
that we sell the future.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
There's a lot of shit.
There's a lot Mel.
What's your take S or S plus?
Uh, actually somewhere in between actually.
Well, if we got to wait, what was yours Rex?
S plus.
So you've got two S plus is the between S plus and S
and then S that does average amount to S plus.
Yeah.
Next up, Matt job.
His whole life is kind of a meme.
His whole career is a meme.
Yeah, polder boy.
Yeah, he's he's maybe taken that step from meme hood
into case study.
I was going to say for me.
It's probably S maybe a he's he's not just an eFAT meme
though. He's like a Monday.
You met you meet.
You said Monday.
I was confused.
I like how people people in chat would have scored him low.
It's like no guys.
I kind of want to score him low too.
Well, we got we got lots of fun out of him in his video
about Game of Thrones.
Remember?
Yeah, man.
People are all over the place about Matt Gebro.
I I think because it's every it's really all over the place.
I'm fine with I'll put him at a for Matt.
I do want to clarify.
Is this just how many eFAT memes there are like how memeable
they are just like for the world?
Because he's got like he's memed a lot outside of eFAT.
Yeah, that's true.
I would say in general.
Well, let's just let's just compare the right.
So if it was eFAT only he probably scores like a B, right?
Yeah, probably.
I don't think he said that.
But if we can't if we count them as a whole which I did say
we kind of have to do sort of because the problem is that then
he wouldn't be any fat fella.
This is very skewed if we don't count them with other stuff
because we're fully a lot of these people have a lot of
backstory we're aware of.
I don't think he's as high as Patrick.
And when eFAT runs we are talking about these people with
knowledge of their backstory.
It's not like eFAT ignores mundane Matt's history.
We made bolder jokes all the time.
That is that is true.
So A around around an A.
Yeah, I think he's more meme-y than Patrick Willems.
So this is an interesting one.
Cinema sins.
I don't actually know.
Probably a D.
I don't know any memes about cinema sins to be honest.
But we haven't really had any memes out of him.
So I'd say just D plus he's not I don't know if he tries to
be meme-y or if he's just chat.
Are there any good cinema sins eFAT memes as cinema since ever
been memed on eFAT not that I can recall.
I have no memory.
Yeah.
It's going D D D F D D F D D D F because I think a lot of
people that we cover talk about cinema sins, but we'd never
really talk about cinema sins.
Give him to D.
I'm not seeing a single meme yet like oh the plank.
That was funny.
The plank was good, but I don't think it was a random plank
in the forest.
At least this is a pirate plank.
That was that was funny.
Yeah, he's still D.
He doesn't get it.
He doesn't get it was the it was the blade from the helicopter.
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, I'm happy to put it as our bottom of the list though.
Yeah, next up.
I think someone who comes close to very few memes, maybe
CTA the right opinion.
Are there any well?
No idea.
He gets credited with rags doesn't he?
I think we give him rags because it was his editing team
that did it, but it still belongs to him.
narrative tripling.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I have to pick it up.
No, I would I'd agree.
He's not as high as Patrick.
I would say yeah, cuz he's he's not like Mimi.
He's just sad.
I I I wouldn't he doesn't like.
I don't yeah, I put a C at the highest.
All right.
I think see the suitable place Joseph Anderson.
So let's see.
My review has been viewed by more people than anyone.
That's a very disgusting horror game subjectivity is implied.
So it was not a horror.
Yeah, yeah.
That was spooky, spooky, spooky, spooky.
Undertale.
So we're A ish.
A to S is probably going to be isn't this probably.
Yeah, he's I'd say a yeah.
Yeah, it's pretty good.
I like a say he's a.
Looks like Chad is straddling between A and S.
Okay.
Oh dude, massive came out of him.
Oh, that's right.
Oh shit.
He's S now that boobs him up to S.
Yeah, congratulations.
Joseph.
Good job.
You're more Mimi than Matt Jarbo.
You did it.
You did it.
You win the internet.
I like the phrase that as massive came out of him.
All right.
Cosmonal variety hour.
Do we have anything on that guy?
I was going to say we might be looking at a B or C here because I can't
remember.
You can't remember you.
You don't get to be if you can't even remember.
Yeah.
I'd say he's a cinema since got the plank.
That was it.
Yeah, but what's what do we have of Cosmo stupid shit?
But I don't think any of us we did actually kind of like his joke about
the whole close shut this damn door and he bleeped it.
Remember that?
That was kind of funny.
I don't know if that counts as a meme though.
I'd say that's still D.
Do any memes chat?
Do any memes come from me?
I'm saying the prize.
No memes have come from him.
Yeah, I'm saying D.
Also, I'm sure a year to six months right.
That's just right.
Well, when we're in here for whatever of you just try isn't in
this list.
No.
Is there a way to add people to the list as you're on it?
Save download reset reset create template.
I'm guessing you have to like upload the pictures individually.
Damn just right.
We can we can do an honorary thing with just right.
We'll probably do him next.
I know we can't put him in but we decide where you go so screenshot
the tail is I'm not seeing like any memes about Cosmo.
Is he a D then?
He's a do you think is a D?
Yeah, all right.
Cause he's he says some yeah, just right.
Probably be an S rank.
If we had him here, I imagine he's point big.
Do you think he would be S huh?
Yeah, he probably would actually.
Yeah.
He did be giddiest didn't he?
A lot of great shits come out of just right.
Yeah, a lot of shits come out of just right.
Did I hit everything on you?
We have we haven't covered and I hit everything video on eFap
yet.
Yeah, only Rags did.
We will get it eventually.
He pops up every once in a while because of it, but we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, and as much as we could use never bored, it's we haven't
covered him yet.
Yeah, we probably S rank just right.
If we had him next up shinobi.
We're looking at like a probably a C again.
I don't know.
No memes that came the stage from him, right?
Yeah, he was like he has a Mimi personality, but no real
memes came from him that we say as far as I know D.
Let me see.
Oh, I guess D would be more accurate.
Yeah.
D is pretty accurate.
I know he blew his channel up after the cover, you know, there
was yelling into the mic and piercing your ears and saying
the blank and then responds.
He talks it through did not come from shinobi.
So when it really I thought it did.
No toxic road came from I think was AJ the OP soon.
Yeah, that was well, I fucked up the thing.
So no, but
yeah, so yeah, I guess he's a D someone.
Someone is saying that shinobi is the origin of the episode
nine question.
Oh, that might bump him up.
Well, would it bump him up to C?
I mean C is an interesting collection.
We've got the guy made no memes, but he created well,
he wrote alien corner is the guy was kind of man, but there
was some things almost like where you go if you just don't
belong in D and we don't know where to put you.
It's like a purgatory here at this point.
I'm okay with putting him at C because of that.
That's kind of what it looks like.
It's what the tier is becoming.
C is like a not meme-y but technically not meme-less either.
Yeah.
He's got at least some power level.
Yeah, it's C is kind of almost normie tier and D is just
boring people.
Eric slash Patricia Taksim.
That's up pretty high.
I'm trying to think of specific memes that came from her.
Yeah, I don't know about.
Yeah, that's a good point specific memes.
I'm not certain just an extremely strange.
I would say vindictive intelligent person extremely could
be C.
What is chat saying?
I think really name a good meme that came out of
Patricia Taksim.
That's a thing.
I can't.
That's why I'm thinking it's C.
I think it's C.
Oh, little centrist boy.
Little centrist boy.
Yeah.
When do we use it?
It was a monumentally ugly.
It was titatically ugly.
We use it during a gig Cadell episode.
Well, oh, yeah, the centrist boy.
Yeah, it's a little centrist boy.
Yeah, that would play C, right?
Because I think that's still C.
Yeah.
For centrism.
All right.
I guess that's a C.
Damn.
Cinema wins.
Cinema wins.
Remind me what we covered from.
Oh, the TLJ one.
Yeah, the TLJ one.
Were there any memes from that?
Were there any memes from that?
I don't know, man.
I feel like we've got nothing for cinema wins.
I can't remember.
Yeah, I think that might be a D.
Just bad video, not meme.
I'm looking at, yeah, we got loads of D's in chat.
The D's are flying through.
Yep.
Yeah, boy.
I don't agree.
So many D's.
Where is F?
What's something like Ocean Man?
Oh, did Ocean Man?
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Because cinema wins went on about people's themes and that's
where that came from.
But I don't think it's, I don't think it was his like, like
while he led to it.
I don't think you can really credit the meme to it.
Oh, and Kyle Ben came out of that too, in a way.
But it wasn't, I don't think it was anything you should credit
to him.
Surely we have to credit them when memes are created.
Like, for example, all the Jeb memes are now accredited to
Jeb Nichols.
Sure, at least.
Yeah.
That puts him in a C, right?
I would, yeah, C. C's fit in with the rest of the memes.
Even more of a C minus, but there is no C minus.
Okay, which takes us to Sarah Z.
Someone said Kyle, someone's Kyle Ben came from Drunk Rags.
I mean, it was definitely the logic of Kyle Ben.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you accidentally, you said, I said, you either said
Kylo Ben or Kylo or Kyle Ren and then we doubled it up because
we thought it was, yeah, because it was a whole like play
Kyle's theme and stuff like that.
Yeah, so there's the fly meme which puts her at least at a
C. I think that's it though, isn't it?
There was the meme about her being the sister of Jared.
I don't know if that had my staying power, probably not.
I don't remember it.
Oh, we, someone saying the burned door that linked to Jared's
room.
Yeah, that's what I meant.
I think that's it though, which kind of places her C.
C. Jack Saint.
I'm thinking we're just gonna need to put him next to Patty
Tax and be done.
Not very, not very meme-able, is he?
No, he's not.
He's kind of a boorish idiot.
Yeah, there's not really a lot that's there to meme.
I'm trying to think of anything.
That was seed seers getting stacked.
Not a lot of fun comes out of that, dude.
Just not a lot of fun at all.
We could be in a D sort of thing for that, actually.
Yeah, I would say, yeah, I'd say he certainly loves me.
If he's got long man bat comes from him.
Oh my god, yeah.
Oh, that's one of the strongest memes we have.
Long man bat is one of the greatest memes.
But we, but I think, did we come up with that because of
him or is he the one who counted?
Oh, he definitely didn't say long man bad, but we came up
with it because of his video.
I'm thinking that he didn't say long critique is not deep
critique is what he had said.
I'm fine with a at least at their bare minimum and a for
that really.
I would go that far.
I would say that we do long the long man think of all the
memes that became of long man.
All the one meme.
It is a powerful.
Yeah, still this means that it's not just quantity.
It is quality.
I guess why do you have to answer?
Yeah, well, we were able to name like four or five things
from Jojo.
You know, what's crazy is I am that Robbie is coming up
soon and didn't the dawn come from his video or was that?
It was one of the people we covered for Captain Marvel.
Wasn't that brown table?
Oh, the whole straw man doing whichever one had Jack as
well.
Robot head is gassed.
Which one was that robot head?
Oh, yeah, Jack is responsible for like a lot of the straw
man memes.
Well, it's between A and B.
I think at this point.
I'm fine with B.
Oh, I will accept to be it's once it's one strong meme
that gets him up to be but it's like I don't I wouldn't
say to write that but that was legal out of her.
No, no, it must have been I'm I'm that Robbie because it
was robot head started it.
He started the meme and it was I'm that Robbie is the one
that he guessed it on.
So yeah, but we've got yeah, I'm fine with B.
It doesn't put it puts above the quagmire of C.
We got straw man and long man bad coming out of him, which
is strong but with do we definitely concluding that he's
lower than Matt, Matt, Matt job over then.
Yeah, he's lower than that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Game makers toolkit.
Hi.
Oh, that's gonna be I know how meme-able he is for that
too.
Yeah.
Yeah, because that's the thing.
It's just like everything he says.
Yeah, like there's so much out of his mouth.
When it comes to if have so much inspiration come from
this guy.
I mean, it is already down the bottom.
Yeah.
Goodell is entirely like supposed to be afraid does his
show.
Yeah, it's a tile for press the
forms.
The aim for
the double jump.
He's so fantastic.
Is he Jay jump?
No, not quite.
He's got a lot of good means, but he doesn't.
He's not rhino milk.
Dark Souls.
Dark Souls.
He's Dark Souls.
Some people are asking us about like Dark Souls.
No, he's not.
We know who that's reserved for.
We know who God like is.
One slot for God like I think.
I don't know.
So you guys plus you guys deciding s plus I'm going with
s plus two.
What's the three remaining votes?
I agree.
Yeah, s plus is good.
I would say s but I'm happy with s plus.
You just don't want to
You don't want to
Come on Jay share.
Don't be dad guy.
Ren's reviews or Ren reviews.
I can't see not too familiar with the guy.
There was a couple memes.
There's a couple
Let me other than the meme list, but he's not got any proper
memes.
He's like it's a B or C.
I think really so what would you say what would lift him out
of C?
Yeah, what pushes him up to a B actually?
Yeah.
Okay.
I changed my vote just to see he was a familiar faces guy
right multiple faces.
Yeah, remember like what multiple faces.
He gave us a live example of somebody like refusing to accept
information moving the goal post like seven times in a row.
That is true with the mask creator.
Yeah, I was crazy.
That was in that was really interesting.
That was the having him watch that specifically after we
pulled up the clip and showed it to him.
It's it's like a man losing his religion.
It was very odd.
He created Southpaw.
Hmm does that lift him out of C?
It's not D, but it's not A.
So it's.
Yeah, I don't know about the loaded A right now.
He's gonna be alone where free goes.
She's in good company, but I doubt I doubt anything would really
take him out of C.
Yeah, someone's saying bringing forth Southpaw meme.
I agree.
That's fair.
Let's go to multiple places me first.
I'm watching one of these for wake Robin in the chat.
We're ranking the meme ability of all the the e fat villains.
So why didn't you say you more you can't change team when
it's convenient that mean change team change team first off.
Don't take it too seriously.
Yeah, I'm ranking the meme ability of e fat villains.
Well, you mean you're you're not taking this seriously.
So yeah, very seriously.
This is like the most important thing.
I've done all I'd say C.
I think C.
Yeah, he Stacey.
Okay.
So next up according to me is God like yeah, God like if you
disagree, you're wrong.
God like you're wrong.
You're objectively wrong.
God like damn.
He's that fantastic.
I'm just curious.
What's happening is there any disagreements if any if anyone
disagrees kill them.
I'm so I was gonna say that kill came out.
God like God like God like God like 1.2 we create 1.2.
There's no point in referencing all the memes that come out
of him.
There's too many.
There's too many.
We'll have a whole episode.
Total tier.
Total tier.
There's a whole tier.
A plus to T.
I'm putting down agreement.
Leave God like empty.
What he wasn't putting down agreements.
That was me.
No, I know but I say get a chat.
Yeah, there you go.
Leave God like empty and have Tonal be ascended above it.
Yeah, we've got like a total tier above God like T rank.
And then next we have toxic group T or Captain.
I can't even fucking see it because of the background color.
Okay.
Are you actually adding another one?
Yeah, it says it's wrong.
Ronald Donald total add to dictionary totaled.
Yes, how do you the heavenly color?
I'll add row above.
Okay.
Here it is.
I see it.
There.
So you change God likes a black now put it back.
I have to check this to be sure but I'm pretty sure AJ is the
guy we covered with world-class bullshits and geeks and gamers.
He's the one who did the toxic brood.
The thing about how you'd follow a waitress into an alleyway
with a knife.
If she don't know what the fuck that was anymore.
I'm trying to remember it.
What are we looking at?
Yeah, at least s it definitely sounds very sane.
Yeah, toxic brood ends in a lot of points.
What do you think chat?
What other memes came from that video?
I can't even remember.
He named the community Medea was born in that episode.
I don't know if it was his fault in any way though.
Medea was born.
John Adam spider.
Oh shit.
That was that episode.
Oh, see the one looks like you're allowed to like he was
all.
Yeah, you're allowed to like this plus s plus really.
I'm okay with now.
No, no, I don't know.
I don't think he's s look at s plus these are lame generators.
He's not like he's made some strong memes.
That's for sure.
He must have the highest memes per minute generation.
Well, his video was long.
Yeah, but still it's not like well game makers toolkit
generates me.
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
And tonals meme generation is off the charts quite literally.
We had to we had to extend the chart to include him.
I'm saying s yeah, I'm cool with s.
Yeah, s is good.
All right.
Yeah.
All right.
We got the high tiers getting some good company now.
I am that Robbie who is responsible for the dawn a ha ha a
for the dawn.
Really?
I don't know man.
That's that's another super strong.
It's another super strong, but it's one so far.
We need to wait.
Wasn't he the top-voted man by the community?
He was yeah, I think we need to see if that's still the case
because there are new memes now.
There are more relevant me.
Yeah, but the fact that it won that poll anyway is yeah,
I mean it and I would say that does he get credit for that?
I can I can support him being an S if it's created.
I think that's our rules.
Anyway.
All right.
Yeah, that's fine.
I can support him being an S because it keeps my job.
Oh, I think it matches s got the creation of the toxic brood
in there as well.
Yo, somebody just sent hang on somebody just sent me a list
of updated memes.
There's a whole lot more names in here.
Do we want to go to this one?
Oh, give me the is the same as this.
If you give me the link, I'll just slot everybody.
We've done already.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, we're almost done.
Wait, no, no, I'm in this shit.
Here it is.
All right.
Thank you to kibakins.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, yes.
I do wonder what this like tier list would look like if it
was entirely community vote based.
Yeah, there's so many more now.
Oh, take a look.
Do is doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.
There we go.
And I'm just gonna put this over here.
Second while I slot everybody into the oh my god, that's
a lot.
So Sarah Z was nuts.
See we didn't do.
Wynton.
Yeah, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo Jay.
Yeah, shut up.
Tornald.
It's tornald.
We're missing from oh, he's down there.
AJ.
Yeah, mr.
Anderson.
Oh, where's Monday Matt?
Matt was a no, I mean, where is he in the pictures?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, three three fuck theater.
That's him, right?
He's three, but theater is him.
Then we need Willems and Jack Saint and oh, I got a whole
bunch through here.
Film joy.
TRO.
Where are you?
Oh, is TRO not in here?
Whoops.
We lose TRO.
Yeah, but I mean, you know, he was in the sea.
So I guess it's not too bad.
The sea is where he is there where he's already in sea.
I'm retarded.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm retarded too then.
All right.
Tax on.
There we go.
Cinema wins.
Doo doo and D was cinema sins.
And there we are.
All right.
I have successfully transferred old man.
Well,
all right.
So next up is Quentin reviews.
It's got to be a high scorer.
Who's that right next to him?
He kind of looks like Quentin reviews.
It's the guy we code from the small video.
The director of Shazam.
We watched his five-minute video.
Well, he can put him and D right away then.
Yeah, that's the D.
Quentin is probably 80.
At least that was a very strong.
That fucking thing was pretty strong.
I don't think he's a little strong manning.
Is that really put him above long man bad though?
And Teddy Milk is my favorite addition to Star Wars.
Hmm.
You make a point.
See what chat has to say.
When does either a or a review is just the description of your experiences?
Yeah, he has a lot of new characters plot.
Lore consistency is just fan stuff.
I fucking hate Trump rags.
I'm like rags think some movies objectively bad if it sells toys.
Oh, and and and it's the his opinions.
Well, they are subject or they are objective.
There are a couple of these memes where a lot of them some people
might not even remember some of these.
They're a bit.
Some people might not even remember what a y-wing is.
I would just write is wonderful.
I would say he's already getting up there between everybody
always asks why wing they never ask how wing.
Do you want better?
Why wing?
Got it.
I went well.
I'm just gonna go come myself.
I'm okay with a what's what's everyone feeling?
It's a and s in the chat.
What?
Well, I'm asking you guys.
Yeah, it's fun.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'd say a rag is.
It literally isn't showing your icon.
So I'm like, oh my god.
It worked.
My icon is gone for you.
It's gone.
That's a screenshot of it.
It's just not there.
I see.
Well, rip me in your it's actually weird not having your
icon.
It's like you're talking to me from some other place.
All right.
Well, actually, where are you?
So pop culture detective who we have not covered since I think
it was so I want to say three could be two classic.
I think it's three one who had the hilarious take on TLJ,
but I'm not sure what memes have survived from that.
Yeah, I'm trying to think right now.
He might just be be.
I mean, I'm trying to think of what he's just a pretentious
theme-racing idiot.
Like what brings them over to you?
I don't think anything that I know of.
I don't know who this is.
This next one.
Neither do I.
No idea.
Help us out.
Who's this guy?
Who is that?
Could be just like so one of the random videos we've covered
before.
Probably is.
D rank.
Oh, obviously, these are all from efap.me.
Oh, yeah.
Which means I can just go there and look at the list and
find him.
Somebody said he did the core of it with er.
Oh, did he was that him?
If it wasn't the core of it, just right.
I feel like I don't know because then that were big ideas
came from.
Yeah, he did.
Why core is better than aang avatar than aang yet.
So so that was not just right.
No, this guy.
Well, he did a core video too.
Oh, got it.
Yeah, that guy we've he's got to be D.
There's nothing I remember about that.
I don't even remember covering the video, but we yeah,
we watched it with you.
Put him in C just for nostalgia.
No, you don't get C for nostalgia.
No.
All right, Major Lee.
Major Lee S plus.
It's a possible S plus.
He's a slice.
He's really up there.
So we got slice and dice.
Look at women.
Look at women.
Those just just those two on their own.
I think puts them in at least as.
That's the problem is certainly a pretty long one.
And he is just a meme on his own as well.
Like he is.
Well, does he lose any does he lose points for being like
like his motivations being kind of?
Oh, you mean like a funny man.
Yeah, like just trying to be provocative for its own sake.
That's good.
Losing points that I think they came out of S plus.
Yeah, I would because I think that the the the integrity
if that's the way to call it the the the honesty of their.
You know, the way they carry themselves as part of it.
Like he seems very disingenuous.
I'd agree with that.
Yeah, so but not in the way the others are.
But what I will say is we don't know for sure
because I'm happy to actually believe that he's.
Well, he says that's what he said, isn't he?
Yeah, but that's what I mean.
That's what I mean.
Like so he says a lot of stupid shit and it's like,
are you fucking serious to the list?
And then he's like, no, I'm going to provoke you.
Who's that touched fingers?
Was that guy?
Yeah, that was him.
Yeah.
So what is that?
Like I think that he partially said that as a sort of cover
for how stupid a lot of the stuff that he says is.
That might drop him to S.
Because of what Rags said about how he.
Yeah, I agree.
I think he's an ass.
Yeah.
And also the I mean, the whole debate was just a nightmare nightmare.
So there is the next is that a wing.
What is that?
It's legal, legal, I think.
Is that legal?
Is that legal legal?
It is legal, legal, yeah.
Oh, yeah, and then he was the one saying like you touch the map
and that's battery.
It's at least he's not.
He's above sea.
So is that where Dawn's from?
No, no, no.
Bolstered.
I think I think he bolstered the Dawn for sure to be like,
you know, he's on really flourished.
He's a charitable guy and then he and then she fucked him up.
Yeah, I think since we're doing all of them, the official meme
rating needs to appear on efap.me next to the little profile.
The meme rating for the total.
This is total.
I'm liking me so far for the guy.
Unless we can come up with any more that he had.
We got two memes.
They didn't go long, but they're good ones.
He meant us more angry though.
Like he legit like made me angry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He it was just kind of disgusting.
The video like and kind of threatening in the much above sea
at that point.
He came after the Dawn like there you do you do get docked points
for that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's another one of those ones where he is himself.
Oops.
I've heard him reference so many times as a joke.
He battered her.
Is are we thinking like she batted B or C.
Sorry.
Yeah by that logic.
She she battered Stan Lee.
So is everyone happy with me?
Yeah.
All right, Jim Sterling privilege goggles.
That is all privilege goggles.
Privilege goggles doesn't get referenced that much which puts
is that C.
I think it would be C plus but I think yeah, C could be a B.
So I see competition is a little tough.
We've got some echo C to be honest.
See he's not he's no long that that's like putting privilege
goggles on the same level as long.
I think C is pretty decided that B is one strong meme a is
like either one strong meme with a couple of bonus memes
and then S is like several strong memes then S plus is
like several great memes.
Which would be with the expectation of more memes to come
which puts Jim Sterling in like a C surely.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's just not really bright or anything.
So what culture is next D D.
Yeah, I'm even having trouble kind of remembering.
Yeah.
Next up is oh is that never look.
Oh, yes, it's Jeff Nichols.
Jeff Nichols.
Probably A.
We don't know how those memes are going to last.
Yeah, I think A is fair because there's some great memes
that come out of it.
We don't know how long they'll last.
Sure.
I could see B though.
I'm happy to agree with AFF runs.
We're going to be fine with AABBAADB God.
I just don't know that those memes haven't like caught up
to me yet.
So I don't know got a lot of different takes the Jeb Bush
meme.
I don't know how long that'll last.
I don't know what's going to happen with it.
I think it's strong.
My name is Jeb.
What else was there in that stream?
There's a lot of stuff.
Yeah, because it was like just it was more wrong than Mimi.
Sure.
It was flat out wrong.
Oh, she what was it the direct quote where she said I think
it was exactly these words watching Fantastic Beasts gives
me immense sexual satisfaction.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm always coming for Fantastic Beasts.
I think I nailed it the first time.
Looks like that might you think that is an A?
I think that's not there's no way it's not an A.
Well, we've got we know we've got the thing is with A is
like one strong meme with several memes or several medium
memes like she's got a extremely strong name and a couple
Yeah, I mean still making Jeb jokes when the damn stream
started today.
It was kind of nuts.
Yeah.
You know, it might not last who knows but I think an A is
a safe spot for now.
A provisional A.
Yeah, because A is like middle she could go lower or higher
as time progresses.
You think we should hold on to this in case these are subject
to change like somebody might start like come up with a
really crazy-ass meme.
You can save your lists.
Yeah, let's compare a year from now.
Yeah, so insider.
I don't even remember covering insider.
D.
No idea what it is.
If we can't remember who this is they go to D.
Yeah.
Who D?
All that game of for bars.
I remember us covering him briefly.
I just wanted to find but I don't think any memes can
get it was probably a dreg because he's terrible, but I
don't think any beams come out of it.
His meme ability is low D.
What's the FBI frame by frame.
That was the guy who did the video on how raise not a
Mary Sue.
I think.
We covered it during the 50th with doom cock and critical
drinker.
I think.
No idea remembering any memes from it though.
No, I don't remember it.
All right, off to D.
Sorry man extra credits.
Here we go.
You're a Nazi.
Yeah, it's like that's like Prime meme like and it was
in general.
I know this is just an efap thing, but man when they made
that video.
That has been like the I think it might be one of the
most respond.
Oh, sorry frame by frame is sword like weapon.
Oh, that person is not even.
Maybe even be yeah, it's a strong meme, but I think we
see because these strong memes are pretty damn strong.
Yeah.
Stick like weapon.
Yeah.
All right.
No, that's it.
And then ask for extra credits.
What are we looking at here?
Hey, we're between an A and B.
A A A B.
I'm happy with a like this overall one potential like
yeah, but that's like a like a general meme for everyone
to be honest.
It's not like efap exclusive.
So I would actually go for B personally.
Hmm.
Yeah, that in mind B is looking a little more.
I'm fine with that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I can agree with that too.
I'm all right with that.
DX.
What was DX's video?
Is that that's not sausage man, right?
Sausage man is criminal.
No, we had him on right.
DX was a subjectivity.
That was a he's the Holocaust denier.
Wait, really?
He actually deadly to die.
No, you just I think you just misspoke in a really weird way.
It's like, oh, no, no, no, no, probably see what is what are the
memes?
Because I remember the conversation.
I'm trying to remember any memes that came from it.
I said, I've been playing some cards on the side and I haven't got
Piccadilly yet.
I don't think you can derive joy from a fictional event.
Oh, he said words only have one meaning.
Oh, yeah.
Was that him?
That was him, wasn't it?
That's probably a B.
Who that might be a B.
I like we've made a certainly no longer boring.
It looks like a Christmas tree.
What we have right now.
Yeah, like half a Christmas tree.
I mean, it's just the star on top.
Yeah, although that in mind, who's going to have anybody here's
God like exactly.
What's looking at this list?
Well, you know, we're going to have to be at least going to go
through a revision at the end.
We're going to take a look at the list.
Adjust accordingly based on where everyone else because at the
beginning, we didn't have any reference.
So now that we're getting there at the end, we can go through
watch Mojo.
I think that's a D right.
I don't fucking remember.
I'm sorry.
I hate to I hate to bring this up, but Cosmic Chicken Goliath.
Oh shit.
That was that stream.
That's like I would consider that efap honorary efap.
Wow, that was an amazing stream with cynic snacks until that's
a non-canon made by Disney when they non-canonize.
That probably actually lifts them up to at least a I might
even say S.
Yeah, this Goliath cosmic chicken.
Yes.
Yeah, those were the only names in that stream were they surely
though.
I swear there were more in that.
That's the mean boy.
That's the stream.
We got like a tonal congealed in a cave.
Oh God, that's an orphan Lord.
Oh yeah, that's the orphan Lord as well.
Yeah, that's it.
Wow, that's S.
That's definitely S.
That's my love.
How much has got nothing to do with it wasn't it wasn't it
wasn't the orphans like got continued there.
They didn't originate that true, but a lot of the significant
orphan law did come.
Yeah.
What do we think?
The orphan bone density came from there.
Still like an S.
That's that's that's weird because wolf just said that's a
godlike mean.
Really?
Well, the cosmic chicken is a god.
I guess we could put them in there.
Mo.
Oh man.
Mojo is actually a orphans cosmic chicken.
Tonaled congealing.
They get godlike status for no reason of their own like it
yeah, but that's the problem is that a lot of the beams are
generated because of us anyway, so I don't I don't think we
can give them godlike status because they didn't it's not
and none of them is there for like at all.
No, I'd still say it's S.
They just got lucky.
I'm fine with S because I think what Jay saying is a good
point where it wasn't really them in any way at all.
It was us.
We're there because of watch.
Well, Joe, they they only spoiled like to attribute it
solely to whatever they say they be indeed.
No, yeah, but no, they did spawn like the deserts.
I think we give them credit for the fact that that's a mean
that didn't move on in any way though.
That stayed right there.
We got a lot of that like that happened on their watch, which
I think we need to give them credit for which a lot of credit
for those beams, but they didn't actually do anything for it.
So they can't be super high.
All right.
So what you're saying a now a yeah, I think I think is appropriate.
I think yeah, I'm fine with a fine with a because of that.
Yeah, all right.
If we're consistent with that.
Scipulation a yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I agree.
Next up is I don't know who that is.
Lee Dave Lee Down Under Down Under.
No, this thing was I can't even like I will find I'll find out
from you have 43.
Was it 43?
I'm not sure what I can't remember.
I know what it was.
It was the fact that you guys can't even remember is probably
evidence for I was a D.
We almost gave watch Mojo a D though.
I mean technically I still think they kind of deserve it.
It depends on what the ruling is the complication.
If we really had to go, I would say at least see but I say
they're all right a day right now.
Anyway, this guy.
Who is he if we establish that?
Well, that's the problem.
I'm still trying to actually figure out something from like
chat to be able to explain this because I I don't remember.
Oh, it's Dale.
I think Dale's a lot of stuff.
Wasn't which was Dale the one that was like men hate Star
Wars or the rooting.
So that's the next one.
No, it's not.
Oh, that's no that's the one you're on that.
So the stream was behind for me.
Yeah, there's a little behind too.
I've refreshed it twice now.
It's like way.
It's just a YouTube latency.
It's not that you can do about it.
Yeah, men are ruining Star Wars.
See there's not a lot of actually stayed from even his
debate portion and the video because it was just terrible.
I think it was the fact that you didn't stand for any of it.
COD probably see.
Yeah, I'd say C.
I have no idea.
I don't know the guys.
Next up is sausage man.
A yellow pipe and sausage man are very like not super strong
memes, but they I think it puts them at a B.
Apparently film was cinema Roberto gave Dark Fate 7 out of 10.
What is this happening?
I'm a jerk.
Yeah, people are saying B.
BC mainly be so what did he do?
It was the yellow pole sausage.
Oh, the yeah.
Yeah, the yellow pole guy.
I feel like there were more from that stream though.
Are we missing anything?
I think drink that stream halfway through.
Yeah, and I came back at the end.
I would probably place in between B and C, but I'm liking B.
So far sausage was pretty good.
We got a we got a few really good drawings out of that.
Sausage Raider.
That was good shit.
Yeah, I have no memory of any of those.
Yeah, I'm putting on B.
I would say B.
Be then I guess.
So be it.
Okay, next one is like a seat picture.
I'm trying to see what is that comic book cast to.
Thanks to this last song.
Which one was this?
Yeah, I'm trying to look at the channel.
I don't remember.
Looks like a microphone to me.
You know, I really love how useful this site is that we've got here.
It's so crazy.
Who are these people?
They were covered during.
Wait, wait, wait.
All right.
Efap six.
Holy shit.
Wow.
Wait, really?
Oh, the guy the guy who had like oh my god, this is a deep lore.
Right?
Do you remember this?
He was like trying to look at all the things on.
Oh my god.
So so nostalgic.
He's he had like Wolf was disappointed because he had a whole
bunch of witcher stuff.
He just I think he was his whole video was basically saying
that TLJ sold well.
So it's not that bad.
I do remember this is going back.
Oh, I think I do remember like I remember.
Yeah, the toys this guy that we've completely forgotten about
him though.
Yeah, that's gotta be status.
Yeah, probably.
Yeah, wait, so it's not it's not useful because they sell toys
who said that?
No, that's I think that's combining Quinton's quote about
Rags.
Quinton said that Rags thinks a movie is objectively bad if
it sells toys.
Right.
I don't understand that statement.
Next up we got closer look which is pretty epic celestial
even bone-chilling.
I pick epic celestial bone-chilling bone-chilling and
come to the voice.
Yeah, I'm chilling.
B or D must be biossi.
What's no, he's getting like a really you think that's a dude
people are saying epic and celestial all the fucking time.
I say the my stream like every time says a constant.
All right, okay.
I'm comfortable with it.
What do you think chat?
We got a c a c a a a a k a a c for celestial a a b a c
for celestial.
I guess a is where he's where he's sitting fighter productions.
Who dat who did code them on 50 apparently.
I don't remember fighter productions.
No.
Part one.
I don't productions.
So when I wish I could check this guy who did the Civil War
coverage.
That wasn't very good.
I think it's a D.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah D.
Sorry fighter productions.
Then we got guy who he's prototype Patrick Willems and yeah.
Well, Patrick Willems stole from him.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
D.
Yeah, D like I bet a lot of people are probably like shocked
to see that face.
I'm surprised that you remembered it because I was about
to try and explain that's who he was.
Yeah, he's basically the whole plot holes.
People shouldn't focus on plot holes thing that Patrick
Willems did except this guy did it too.
So he has got one slight meme.
Oh, yeah.
I redrafted this nine times over 11.
Yeah, he did say that.
Yeah, but did anyone ever use that?
Is that that's where I've heard that come up again.
He's not totally memeless.
You know what D is.
I thought D was like, you know, cinema since his plank doesn't
matter the planet.
That's true.
Actually, yeah, yeah.
He's key.
Okay, he's D.
Vox.
We covered them saying that the X-Men cinematic universe makes
a lot more sense than Marvel's.
No, no.
Yeah, I just say that.
That's a D.
I can't remember anything else about that video.
I mean Vox is a meme, but nothing even related.
No, we don't even reference much of anything about it.
Yeah.
Now we got Wisecrack who created Allen.
The middle is the best thing ever.
We're lost forever.
This is my favorite part.
Bass.
That's a pretty high meme.
That's pretty I'd say a at least price a looking at between
a and S.
What is Allen the middle and I think wasn't that the me high
cheeks and me high stream because that's the middle rank.
I don't know man.
We've just rolled out.
Yeah, but it's it's sure it's in the middle but tonaled is
tonaled and we have no God likes yet.
I'm put I think you should be an S.
This is pretty strong meme material to be a tier separates
and everyone else from tonaled and that's God like
we'll figure it out.
It's all right.
Yeah, I'm I'm okay with S.
Yeah, I think that we hide all the middle stuff Allen.
Yeah, remarkable Republican.
Oh, that's like a or S.
Loud soup.
Yeah, oh, yeah, it is a lesbian.
Oh, Robocop is a ripoff.
Darth Vader.
Yeah.
Robocop S.
Cuz you know, I see three girls a gay butler Tywin.
I'm still a homosexual.
Oh, yeah.
Apex homosexual.
Yeah, I'm convinced S.
We've got a fucking shit of him wanting to build a theocracy
on Mars.
Oh shit.
We got no bullshit.
So suspicious amount of women.
Suspicious amount of
giant budget.
Giant, but yeah, so with that so far, he's B.
Say at least to be the can we think of any more that came
with that?
He does get referenced a little bit.
Yeah, I think he said he does get referenced a lot.
That's right.
And I feel like his memes you could do a lot with them.
Mm-hmm malleable memes suspicious amount of women will
never die.
Yes.
I've never heard that before.
So I was trans.
Yeah,
he did say that is trans.
What the hell is a trans human?
Overrepresentation of giant midgets thing, of course perfectly
balanced.
Yeah.
So is everyone happy with B?
Yeah, I'm fine with B.
Yeah.
Just from what I've heard.
I'm fine with B.
Yeah.
Oh my goodness.
Just right.
S plus.
Play.
Just right.
God like in meme factory.
Well, let's read a response theory.
Damn it.
We've got read a response.
They're not.
That's how big idiots is ironic.
Oh, yeah, I'm on it.
He's ironic.
So those three alone get him to S plus.
I think.
Yeah.
And so we had the people don't remember why we're pretty
great as well.
Yeah.
Oh, I see.
And then there was the debate that you guys had with him.
Oh, God.
Like the robot.
The robot came from that.
People don't remember.
There's the fact that you like first viewing first viewing.
Oh, yeah.
Didn't know that God like I don't I don't know if that's
God like because S plus is so strong.
Yeah, I suppose.
I might put I probably put a mess plus.
Oh, good.
Rats is brown table guys.
It's not good.
Rat is brown table.
Table's covered.
Brown table is fantastic.
So people are saying good rat.
So I'm Karl Marx.
This reminds me of Karl Marx.
That's that's your that's brown.
Yeah.
So we got to wait for brown tables.
Okay.
Did he say did he say evolve as a critic?
Yes, he did.
Oh, I think he's got like I think we have a God like I think
we've got God like meme tier.
Damn.
Oh, man.
Chat one for God like to first S plus just just report because
I almost feel like one and two never works.
He keeps him from God like and so on like four of them have
worked.
Oh, man.
You also have to say God like to talk about Cora.
We have to bring up an 18th century German philosopher.
AJ AJ.
Oh, it doesn't work.
Look at those words.
Look at him.
Yeah, he's got like yeah, it's settled.
Congratulations.
Just right.
You are the God like if at me, you are the God like he fat
me.
It's so great because he's such a pretentious youtuber.
So he's like, what do you mean of a giant beam?
He's extremely pretentious and his brain size can't justify
it which makes it so Mimi next up is high top brain which
would obviously probably rank it's a D.
I don't remember him being beamed at all.
Hi top.
He's got some not great videos, but he's I don't particularly
remember anything Mimi about it.
People this people every once in a while people will ping
and say what about Wags is like that guy's not on here.
Yeah, Wags Wags is IH's buddy on the podcast.
We can we can barely say that belongs to IHE.
So yeah, it's not even IHE.
It's the IH's buddy.
Wags won't be on.
Unfortunately, he was in on the island of speech impediments.
He can't help it, but it's still a meme.
Only he made a channel that we covered there.
He made a channel.
I'm sure he'd have amazing takes.
Wait, he referenced.
That's actually not a terrible idea.
It's such a bizarre stream.
Just FYI.
So I know all right.
So yeah, I'm fine with high top being just a D.
So we got Hello Greedo.
Hello Greedo.
I'd say at least me as well.
Yeah, what are you saying after bacon?
So I think of a waste of time more than debating art.
Right.
I got that.
What an interesting person.
I don't know that you might be a C because the problem with
his memes.
They don't last from what I remember.
He is himself a meme.
True.
True.
But does that get you to be status?
I think so.
Extra credits and Patrick Willems are certainly memes.
Yeah, I guess Jackson is kind of a meme.
Oh, yeah, I certainly say I think when we mention Hello Greedo,
I in probably a fairly substantial part of the audience
thinks of him as a meme.
Like we don't take him seriously.
I'm just remembering his type photo.
His type fighter.
Yeah, and his he where he streams wearing a helmet.
Oh, why the fuck bother?
Why have set up a face cam so that then cover your face.
So no, I can see his helmet.
Did a meme come out of him when people talk to him on stream
at one point?
Yeah, that was mainly just him misunderstanding.
You've had memes are not really like okay.
I wasn't sure if he said something like in response and
it kind of came out wrong.
I'm not I can't remember wearing a mask for a face cam.
That didn't like that was more just a joke that rags made.
That was funny.
Like it doesn't really evolve into anything of a meme.
Yeah, say with the tie fighter.
I think so tight.
Yeah, his his mind are Minecraft skills memeable.
Not really.
Everyone's typing in Jamaican.
Oh, yeah, because you're making it up.
Yeah, he looked up massive.
Oh, yeah, and then it was Jamaican.
That's what he said.
Well, this is why I think B is probably bad.
Makes him be.
Yeah, I said B.
All right, then all right.
Yeah, it I think he's been around long enough.
We've covered him long enough and he's brought us enough
joy and laughter that he's elevated out of the sea Quagmire.
Yeah, welcome to be welcome to be here.
So we got to the young ticks that one video from Joker.
We watched.
I remember the video.
I'm trying to think of women.
The funny thing is that it opened with just say Joker hates
black people or whatever.
It doesn't like black.
Yeah, has a problem with black.
Right, right.
Yeah.
either I I'd probably put them in D.
Yeah, I can't I don't think we spent too much time with it.
Well, it was only a three-minute right after that.
It wasn't a very long video was only three minutes,
but it was horrible.
Oh, yeah, it's it's TYT man.
That's the thing shit in terms of quality of video
because we'll do that next that should be easier than this
because there's not going to be as much memory.
Right.
But yeah, he's a captain.
Midnight to D because I can't remember.
Yeah, yeah.
Angry Joe.
So we got Joe senior out of him,
but that's not really something we can equate to him.
Yeah, Joe is he's kind of an offensive in that regard.
He just has bad takes.
He ranks movies really badly.
Yeah, suicide squad kind of his problem.
Angry Jew.
Oh, yeah, angry.
Angry Jew.
Does that mean he's a see that probably?
Does that put him up to see angry?
Do you look at how long that meme lives?
Really? Angry Jew.
Joe is a brand new all the press.
Yeah.
So yeah, I'd say they're God's chosen people.
Oh, God.
Next up is movie.
Bob.
We've got to pass the rest.
Plus cinema battle.
I don't the entire chat just says angry Jew.
So you said S right away.
Why do you say that?
The man is a meme like he is a mean that is a kind of him being
a meme isn't enough to push him that high.
So what else we got?
Yeah, yeah, but he's a prominent meme.
Like he's the biggest meme creator.
Yeah, but just being a meme only give you I get it because he
is a meme because he thinks so highly of himself.
He thinks he's the biggest fucking galaxy brain ever.
Now we really have like Christina Hoff summers on Twitter recently.
I can't really just like the meta narrative shit.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The meta narrative talking fast shit.
All of the memes were bad wolf quit wolf had enough.
You know, he's not just one second several people.
He killed Jay Longboat.
I think as well as well.
Um, I'm fine with him being be because of that like like he
has a reputation.
I was gonna say doesn't he fits in with be Patrick Willems
and Jack Saint an extra credit.
Yeah, he really do.
I'd say he's starting to shape up to be very consistent.
No bullshit.
These are all mean people.
Yeah, but their memes themselves are weak.
Yeah, the memes themselves aren't too fantastic.
But those people my goodness.
All right.
Brown table.
Ironically, I don't know if I'd sell for anything less than
s plus.
He's uh, you think sexual harassment.
What are we talking about brown table brown tables coming
out?
Yeah.
Good rat.
I like the giddiest must be giddiest him as well.
That was that was just right.
Are there any other good brown table memes?
I like to not his entire
This reminds me of Karl Marx.
Yeah, we had the whole the whole Zootopia thing was because
of him.
How he was a laugh riot.
I love tables videos.
He's all like if he carried on in the exact same quality,
he would start to get to a tonal for me like he would start
to get to a time as it stands for the s plus and he acknowledged
I don't know if I put a rough s plus s I I would well.
Yeah, cuz I got to put him above Republican and wise crack
and all them.
Yeah, I'd say s plus brown table.
They can do to called sexual harassment and Skillshare.
Someone saying Skillshare did have the way wasn't that closer
look that did the that stuff or am I thinking the like the
Russo's would benefit from from some creative writing.
Oh, the nobody comes to my birthday thing.
That's all.
Yeah, that's we laughed our asses off.
Oh my goodness.
Someone says Batman is a symbol of Batman.
I remember that quote was it from that's his Batman Dark
Night Rises video.
We did on 50th.
That was really bad too.
Brown table so special.
I love it.
Make more videos and the dawn was the dawn was brown table.
What?
Oh, no, no, the dawn was like I know a lot of people is struggling
to remember.
But like I said, I know for a fact that robot had created the
meme with us and he was on the stream where we covered.
I am that Robbie who did the first video on Captain Marvel.
He's the guy who said that I'm like the reason we first covered
it was because he like took a shot of me and we were like,
okay, and then we started doing a couple of Captain Marvel
ones and so the dawn originates with I'm not Robbie but it
got bolstered over all the Captain Marvel videos for sure.
Yeah, next up is I don't know all this channels cold, but
I know the video we come from them was the Game of Thrones
one where they're trying to argue that it wasn't too dark
and other things tree sickle.
This one of the few videos we actually stopped watching
because it was just so fucking worthless.
Yeah, then that probably put some on D.
It was automatic D.
Keep us going.
Next is no man gaming.
D.
I can't remember anything about someone in his video.
No clue.
Yeah, and we actually spoke to him as well.
I can't remember that.
Yeah.
All right.
Now we got Seamus Gorman.
D.
I can't remember what we covered.
Get no Game of Thrones fans.
You don't deserve better.
Was that him?
Jesus.
That was him.
Yeah, I don't remember that's part of a bad take than a
mean.
It was all about stuff him saying like I just want a video
with a million views.
Right.
Yeah.
Next one is Chef Rilla Productions.
I think and he did the video on I think it was Endgame.
We covered it with Critical Drinker.
It's the one that took like a whole night to cover.
We didn't talk about it the entire time.
We got on tangent so many times.
It wasn't even a particularly awful video if I think we
concluded and that we just did just nothing came.
It sounds like a C to me.
D.
Nothing is a D.
Thing is lower than that.
All right.
And I'll finally get tested.
Yes, an IRL.
Yes.
Oh my.
So let's say we got the Christmas music at the end.
Christmas music.
The world is better off with to dare.
Yeah.
I was saying that but no, I don't think there were any
memes.
Well, those I think would easily become me.
He's a he might be B tier.
He's he's a meme for sure.
He's certainly recent.
I think if he was less recent, we'd be putting him in D.
Some people are saying D for the pain.
CD.
Maybe see them.
Well, that's yeah, I'm little.
He hasn't begun.
Oh, he said walk of shame is sexist.
Oh, that shit.
Yeah.
Yeah, even after we explained that both men and women have
to do it.
It's still sex and it's first done to a man.
But so it sounds like people saying Lee in disguise.
Yeah.
I'm yeah, it's hmm.
So those get him up to sea.
I don't think that is a sea.
Surely.
I think he hasn't would be sea level.
Yeah, walk of shame is sexist.
Daenerys was better for the world.
Christmas music.
Yes and be gone was a thing that happened a lot.
The lispy voice.
I would say that's a B.
I that's quite a repertoire already.
And tell the fact that he himself is a meme.
I do see sympathy for B right now.
See what's a realist.
He might not age too well over time.
But yeah, he's a B.
Was it brown tape?
So I've seen this once or twice in the chat.
Did the brown table say plot holes don't affect the plot?
Because I saw it before but now that somebody else has said
that.
I don't know.
So it's reasonable to me.
I don't know.
It sounds like such a Patrick Willems thing to say.
Oh, apparently snowman gaming gave us weird grape and blessed
Pightman.
I don't think blessed Pightman came from Jared and Jared
was blessed by Jared.
Yeah, when he was on stream.
Yeah, when Jared came on, but I have given us weird grape,
but I'm almost certainly come from his video if it was I
think brown table saying that potholes that does that elevate
brown table to God like
yes, if we can say that if it's if we can confirm it then
yes.
If someone can give us a all right, tell you what brown
table will be elevated to God like if someone can give us
a video and a time stamp for when he says plot holes don't
affect the plot.
I'm assuming it's the Dark Knight Rises one.
Yeah, cuz this is cuz it just to be certain if there's
some hero in chat you can do that who remembers that we
get this right because this is like Southpaw said yes,
I reached about that.
Remember God like it's no big is a big deal.
We got to make it.
You know, I'm starting to feel like that might.
Yeah, maybe yeah, but because we just because of the
sanctity of the God like tier, we have to be sure this is
like making someone a saint.
The canonization process is really important.
So we got to make sure.
So let me see.
So look.
It was the Dark Knight Rises video.
He said it.
We got a lot of people saying certainty Southpaw's a video
on it.
He said that moment.
Well, I yelled the film like a lot of films is layered with
the possibilities.
Like how did Bruce heal is back so quickly.
Are we doing it?
Are we pushing?
I'm currently listening to this.
So if everyone just listen, it's like 10 seconds.
How do you get back to Gotham?
Yeah, it exists but having no relevance to the plot in any
way.
So having no relevant plot in any way.
Yeah, it exists but having no relevance to so yeah, you
I can't remember what the fuck is rationale is but he kind
of says the plot holes aren't relevant to the plot in any
way.
Okay.
Yeah, but that puts him on God like yeah, I think that's
a level of just grad gradations Brown table.
Good job Brown table.
That's not a level of just because it's bad doesn't mean
it's bad.
Yeah, but we've already decided where he is and he will stay
there forever in our hearts.
So is this it?
This is our meme meme tears.
We've done it.
All right, so let's so here's what we'll do before we call
it.
Let's go to the first couple in each row because those were
made early and now that we've kind of filtered everything
to now that we've got a better relative view of what the tears
are. Let's see if we need to reevaluate some of the earlier
spots that we gave out.
Are we just redrafting a tier list with no, no, no, we're
just taking the first no, no, no, we're just the first in
the first and a special lot of these kids the ones we did
earlier.
It's okay.
It was a joke and calm down.
We power through it.
Yeah, it's power through it.
I was joking.
Yeah, I guess if there's any maybes well, I suppose the
best way to do is everyone have a look.
Is there anyone you think shouldn't be in the tears?
Yeah.
I'm hearing I'm hearing snowman should be bumped because
of the weird grape and the first ragswolf elevator music
argument.
Lot of dealers have so many in there.
Yeah, I don't know.
No one.
I don't know if hmm.
Sarah Z could move down to get rid of the obnoxious gap.
Maybe there's a part of me that wonders if there's anyone
in see who should be D.
Well for the memes for weird puppet person.
Who is that weird puppet person?
I heard the action figures.
Oh, Shinobi.
Oh, Shinobi.
Any reason he shouldn't be D.
Was there any I don't think any means came out of it.
I mean, we just we just kind of remember him for the guy
that blew his channel up after we covered him and then he
like came back shortly after.
So that was memorable, but not really Mimi.
I mean, I swear I remember us naming a meme from him.
What chat chat?
What what meme is credited to him up?
Oh, I'm hearing a lot of people in chat say that Patrick
Willems should be eight here.
I agree.
Yeah, I've seen the same thing.
I'm fine with that because that's up there with Quentin
and it does feel right, but I don't know.
We couldn't reference much from him that we couldn't reference
the same for BTU.
Yeah.
So let's do quick recap Patrick Willems.
You're watching movies wrong.
Spot holes don't matter children.
Yeah, Star Wars is Space Wizards intended for children.
Which is something.
Reviewers don't get paid a lot.
I would say that we yeah.
He did say that.
Yeah, reviewers don't get paid off.
A review of Black Panther from the 20 year old white guy
isn't going to have any.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I that's a for me.
That puts racism puts him into a for me.
Yeah, totally.
Gets you what a racism gets you up to eight here.
Not to mention he said like green monster is my favorite
and you should go away and you're not my friend if you
don't agree or some shit.
Oh, yeah, porgs.
Yeah, if you don't what it was if you don't like something
in the last Jedi, I don't want to be your friend or I think
it was porgs.
Wasn't it?
No, he talked about the milk monster.
He said that was his favorite new thing and you went in
for that rags.
Yeah, there's a highlight for me.
That's one of the first like explosive efap highlights.
Yeah, me app abandoned wolf lost our shit.
Yeah, so he's come.
Yeah.
All right.
Chat, I think chat was right on that one.
Yeah.
A tier for Patrick Willems, especially because we forgot
the racism, right?
I'm wondering if we should move anyone down from C to D.
When you look at the C tier, is there anyone there that you're
like, man, I don't remember fuck all about this.
We film joy.
Yeah.
I wasn't there.
They didn't call the Marines.
Yeah, but who actually who like people remember it when you
bring it up, but it's one of those that's a feature that no
one else has.
He wrote something that was awful like, all right.
Yeah, game.
I mean, it's kind of weird.
You got like a whole like efap gameplay the first one out.
That's the thing.
Yeah, that's right.
Efap gameplay played that game.
So that's attributed to him though.
I don't know.
It's like, all right.
Well, if this is an efap villain thing.
So by playing his game when we were playing it, we weren't
really critical of the story that much.
It was way more the mechanics.
Yeah, the writing wasn't the worst part.
It was the fact that we were playing the game.
From what I understand, the writing is dreadful, but that's
not really what the efap gaming episode was focusing on for
the tism, was it?
Yeah.
So, so does he belong in C or D?
Probably D, honestly.
I'm moving him down to D.
Plus it makes her chart look neater.
Didn't Joseph Addison have some really good books as well?
Just write with books.
Yeah, he, I mean, Joseph Addison is an, is an acclaimed author.
What was it?
What was books called?
Oh, in Stellar Marines.
Oh, yeah, that, does that bump him up?
I don't think that pushes him to S plus.
S plus is pretty good as well.
Yeah, I wouldn't, yeah, he's definitely not S plus material,
but he's definitely S.
I'm seeing a lot of J's God-like in the chat.
I'm proud, but I don't agree.
Yeah, I think that J's too smart to be God-like, if that makes
sense.
Like J's just going to clip that.
I think J's too self-aware.
Like Just Write has no fucking clue how pretentious he is and
how much he can't back it up, but he really thinks that he
is like super galaxy brain.
So I think that's part of why he's so, you know, he's so
God-like in terms of meaning.
The brown table is just glorious.
Brown table is like, yeah, we're talking, he is almost
like the, like discount tonaled, which is already.
He's like tonaled son or something.
Brown table son of tonaled, yeah.
I mean, I'm happy with this tier list.
I'm pretty happy with this, yeah.
Thought it out pretty well.
Someone's just saying tonal should have a higher tier.
Now we don't need to exaggerate it that much.
When you go above Godly, there's just no, you know, there's
nothing above that.
Um, but yeah, I suppose we could, this took way longer than
I expected.
I don't know if it's weird.
What a shock.
If we do another tier list for the quality of those content
creators, that might take another.
I feel like this is on stream almost.
Yeah, actually the whole reason we did this is to act like
show people beeps.
So yeah, we'll do that.
We can always come back later and do it.
Yeah, we'll do it again at some point.
We'll actually, we'll do all the fab villains in terms of
quality of content.
I mean, I'm prepared.
I just ordered some food.
I'm here for the long run.
Tonaled stays in his tonal tier for that, right?
Oh, uh, tonal video.
I don't know.
We'll have to decide that when we get around to it, I guess.
I don't know.
We'll have to decide that when we get around to it.
I guess.
Tonal transcends any form of quality.
All right.
So there's a lot of memes that I've collected and the way
this is gonna have to work is the, it's the way it normally
works, but I may have some difficulties with how these tabs
are working.
I hope nothing goes wrong and that no one notices anything.
I'm just warning you ahead of time that I might need to take
time to do things.
But anyway, let's start with this one is not technically a
meme, but I think we all need to be aware of it.
So Chuck Tingle is the guy who writes the books that professor
Tospot often reads excerpts from and apparently did an AMA and
someone asked, have you heard of professor Tospot's dramatic
reading of some of your books on eFap podcast?
It's great.
I believe he read out your gay donuts and unicorn books.
He said, no, I have not, but it sounds like this is a moment
that brought joy to many.
So I think it's probably a very good way and I'm glad to hear
about it.
I hope everyone had fun.
And I thank you so much for telling me about this.
You've made my timeline a little bit brighter today.
That is very kind.
Thank you, bud.
Really fucking doesn't use punctuation, does he?
No notice to capitalize the eyes, but that's fine.
Who needs to do that?
We just had like a really wholesome comments like fucking
punctuation piece of shit.
It's just odd to see it from an author, you know, his books
are so eloquently written as well.
Is this really him?
So someone said, where's the loud soup in reference to his
noticing that his fucking audio symbol was on the thing and
he said it was a microphone side.
I figured out how to hide it.
I'm surprised that the dubbies on eFap.
Don't know what it is.
It's not a microphone side.
You read speaker.
That's a big old whoosh.
First off, it's a yeah, it's a speaker.
We obviously fucking know it looks like loud soup on Vader's
forehead.
It's hilarious.
We've loved covering your stupid video.
It was amazing.
Give us more loud soup, please.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, so on to memes.
I'm going to try and I was going to say try and do this fast,
but no, no, it'll just take as long as it takes.
Well, it'll involve the only Gex.
Am I the only person who knows what Gex is or I'm aware of
what Gex is because of that H Pomega video.
Wasn't there an old energy drink that had like a lizard like
Sobey or something like that?
Yeah, I was Sobey.
There was yeah, yeah, yeah.
Wasn't really an energy drink though.
I think Sobey was just a I think it was just a like a type
of juice.
I don't think I ever drank that but I did play Gex on Gameboy
at one point.
And to remind you of what the original looked like.
That's what the original cover looked like.
Yep.
Yes, I never played that game did not age well at fucking
all.
All right.
It doesn't look good for it doesn't look good.
And he's got like shit loads of references that were like
90s to like 90s celebrities and it's just please stop.
Please stop talking right now.
I don't know which game this is.
I'm sure chat will know but apparently there was a thing
called the molar in it neat.
It looks really small.
As soon as you're supposed to zoom in idiot.
No, as in the character looks really small compared to the
table.
Zoom in on the character idiot.
Fucking idiot.
A lot of these are going to be things that I show and I even
read out and I wonder how this happened.
There are two premises inside of you.
One is a massive.
The other one is a massive.
You are a massive.
Okay.
Yeah, I can't remember the context is these ones can go
back a long way.
So the screen we don't appreciate them.
Okay, they're wonderful.
Now for anyone who's seen kick-ass 2 will understand this
meme.
I like it.
I totally forgot there's a second one and most people forgot
it's the second one.
Is this any good?
I hate probably not.
All right.
I hated it first time, but I enjoyed it second.
But you know, it's fine.
Oh look, it's a reference to when Jay was criticismed.
Congratulations.
You're being critiqued.
Do not resist.
I thought it was pretty funny.
Me watching Lord of the Rings after Game of Thrones season
8 and the Last Jedi.
My friends you bow to no one logical character progression
three-dimensional characters consistent message and themes
satisfying ending.
Those four were murdered across several of the pieces of
media.
You see it was horrible.
Jay won't get this one.
I'm not sure what this one rags.
What is this?
Doggo McNuggers.
What is the crevice be?
Why don't I forgot the fucking the drawings?
Oh, right.
That was but I'm wondering what doggo.
I probably called him McNuggers at some point.
Chicken McNuggers.
I'll have some chicken McNuggers.
It's a very graphic image.
That's terrifying in its own way in prehistoric times referred
to him as the we managed to imprison him in the Philippines.
Goliath has moved.
Goliath has chosen cynic snacks.
Next target eyes on Goliath.
That's a haunting picture of snacks.
Yeah, that's cold.
images.
I like this good shit.
I heard we showed this before.
I think there's been a few Singapore Singapore.
So Mel, you'll get this because you watched it recently.
Batman 89.
When he gets his revolver, it tends to be a lot longer than
expected and he fires the long at bad yoga days.
That's good.
That's applicable to the oh, yeah, we watched it.
So, you know, this will be a reference for Efap gaming for
Steve, who's definitely not an alien.
I promise I won't get political guys.
What bias cat later?
What was that?
Me and Mel actually own those t-shirts now.
I'm wearing it right now.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, I'm gonna wear it tomorrow as well on stream.
If you want to see it live.
It's a depiction of the Efap war ongoing.
Why am I a little horseback?
Jen just asked what's the point of playing cod multi-player
if everyone is just gonna come up with a shotgun?
I think that this is quite a good meme.
I appreciate.
It's funny because it's true.
It's true.
It's a fact of life.
You should never ignore it.
This is from a Monty Python sketch.
His character was assassinated.
His actions big.
No sense.
No see Luke was a Jedi.
There's another word of that, but it's different things for you.
We need to watch some Monty Python.
I haven't watched any Monty Python in forever.
I want to give a props to the person who made that meme for
doing Luke behind and inside of the cage.
Oh, yeah, cut the actual pieces.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you had to mask each individual bar.
So congrats for the patience.
Yeah, so that's I appreciate the effort.
That must have been frustrating writing TLJ.
Oh, definitely.
And who wrote this with the seagull beam?
Who wrote going on?
Yes, this is so many kick J memes that are going to be coming across as
one of my kicking boots.
I love the implication.
Wait is oh, no, no, no, it's not.
I thought that the Isle of Man thing was actually there.
It does look like it belongs.
It's the lighting on it's pretty good.
It actually got me as soon as I zoomed in and realized.
Oh, okay.
I think a man that they have decent tits in that picture as well.
Yeah, yeah, there's a lot to unpack with this one.
And our thing and this is battle over to the corner.
We're going to watch bad women so soon.
Wait, objective facts.
Just swap those little demons away and you're good.
I'm still going to quit an unhatred power guy.
I don't think you understand the gloob.
I gotcha.
Hey, he's Bob a guy.
I'm sure of the narrative here.
Does does Quinton betray somebody or or is he saying he's going to
defend his ball?
He's going to back him up.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't mind just being like a Hydra thing.
That's fine with me.
Okay, I'll be right back.
I quite like this ping-pong.
He's just a photo someone took.
Okay, it's realistic.
I don't know.
Those words were just there.
Is this what looks to be a few long men?
A few long men but also recommend a few good men.
It's a good film.
It's quite a haunting image a few long men scribes.
What is clearly an event arguably terrifying.
I like one of them is just the chat.
Our chats good enough to be a character in a lot of memes.
Oh, definitely.
So this is a utopia on the sloth.
Definitely.
It's loaded.
May say may say fuck.
That's hilarious because he does at least say it once the
rest are believed.
This is one of those ones where I'm like fuck what's the
context?
pixels pixel fucking oh, yeah pixel fucking it literally says
it in the URL.
Oh, you're right.
I'm retarded.
Well, it's just pixel fuck.
That's that's a far cry from pixel fucking.
Yeah, I'm glad you back me up rags high-five.
I'm not I'm kind of a jam.
This one.
I'm glad you back me up man.
Kind of with you.
I have food quite quite like this.
Funny.
No, I wonder if they came across that by accident or that's
what they made them think of they're like, oh, that's
definitely that you know, this is an actual poster and people
just posted they want us to comment on the fact that it's
described as a massive finale.
And I guess they're really gunning for the whole women
part of it.
Oh, that was the best shot they had for several costumes at
once.
I suppose.
It's a nice looking shot.
Well, I mean it's good for showing costumes as well.
I guess it's just that there must have been a lot of options
for that.
I don't know but we'll see we'll be interested to see what
Oscars are one for who.
This is a very important meme.
I think a lot of people will appreciate.
I love it.
That would hurt that is that is good.
Rad right there.
I'm just sitting there thinking I'm just thinking I would
not be brave enough to sit there.
No, that's my problem with this image epic epic epic celestial
new fap original.
A savior has dawned and the song Prime this is a one of I
think two memes of like apparently there's like a long
version of me out that came out for Pokemon.
I don't know what's going on there.
But yeah, apparently there's a mouth is long now.
Long me out good.
And this is the boys reference.
You got the fan base being like lately some of you have
been a little out of sorts erratic for solo unreliable
for Force Awakens downright sloppy for the last Jedi.
Not you though.
You've been great Vader comics.
I've not read Vader comics but I'm a man.
Mola Prime spook option.
I like it shit.
Both of the icons.
It works.
So I guess this is spook option.
I'm not sure what it is.
I'm not sure what it is.
I'm not sure what it is.
Spook option.
Local military police in Brazil using buffaloes to
patrol.
That looks cool as fuck.
It is actually kind of cool.
Those are they're pretty they're pretty neat looking.
Yeah.
We won't fuck with them.
Nope.
Oh, this is the other version of that meme I guess.
She's dead.
No, she's not.
She's resting.
Like her eyes are close.
So the original Simpsons thing for this is Bart is making
fun of a show for getting the knots wrong.
I think because he's become a Boy Scout and he's getting
good at it and he's like they're getting the rots and accurate
the knots.
You're accurate and homeless.
No, I think Lisa says they don't have to be realistic all
the time.
And then Homer walks by in the background while he's sitting
on the sofa in the room because it's just good shit.
You got Ryan Johnson doesn't know squat Luke wouldn't try
to kill his nephew in his own sleep.
Luke would have been trying to save Ben just like he did
with Anakin return to the Jedi.
Oh, long man.
This is just a move about space wizards for children.
You just see Ryan walking past in the background while
he's there.
Like the cashless Ryan subverting expectations.
It's good.
It's good shit.
I love Simpsons references.
So you got a big idiot.
He was a mathematician and philosopher.
Oh, yeah.
Someone just ultimately look up to you.
I love the fact that someone saw this and thought I don't
have to do.
I know what I have to do.
Delicious things done right.
Right.
I like these ones.
Everyone's in their day to day and they're like, oh, right.
Oh, food.
I have been drawn here for a purpose.
Now we got a what makes good rat in a classroom, obviously.
He's really enjoying this lesson.
We all need to learn about it.
I'm thrilled.
So this is definitely any fat meme.
But now I'm what was what am I missing?
That's Arkansas.
That's the state.
That's the state of Arkansas.
Stopping you from counting to fifty five.
It's two, fifty three, fifty four, fifty four.
It says fifty four twice.
Stopping you from counting fifty four, five.
Right.
Why?
Was this like a fat fifty five?
You fat fifty five.
I don't know.
I named I named the episodes wrong.
I think I think I named two fifty fours and I had to change it to fifty five.
But then I don't understand the rest.
Okay.
All right.
Check the code this number of states.
We did two episode fifty fours.
But then what's with Arkansas?
All we can do.
I don't I don't understand someone just said that's Wisconsin.
Fuck off.
I actually don't know what this meme is.
This may be a road road map to get this one here.
Maybe it's because I was like an I'm from Arkansas and even I know something
something maybe hard to count.
Maybe he couldn't draw a dog and represented rags.
This was a good place.
You guys are talking about.
Is that it?
Yeah.
We know it's about me, but I just I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
This one is me.
All right.
We tried.
We tried our best.
I like getting sent like images of a dog.
I like getting sent like images of people watching.
There's a couple of them in the in here.
But it's one of these got a little.
Oh wait.
I think I might have shown this one because I remember saying like rip all
of those franchises that he's got stuff for outside of Gears of Wars.
Yeah.
Gears is fine.
Gears is fine.
Gears five is fine.
And fall out though.
Rip.
Yeah.
Terminator fall out.
And the franchise is going OK.
So yeah.
We're doing great.
Still strong.
How many how many how many TV series can say that they made it to episode 60
and they're still going strong.
Oh no.
An adventure.
They just simply aren't prepared.
That was me when I first watched a movie about video and he started talking.
It's like stop stop.
I defeat this.
This is the dangers of all of them I guess.
I haven't seen this movie but apparently that's the thing that happens.
I don't know.
That's Christopher Lee.
No I was fucking making a joke.
Idiot.
Also this.
Hers.
And the dawn survived.
So it's all good.
So as long as you've seen the shining this works just fine.
Forever and ever.
Long live.
Times bestseller.
Long bad bad.
And I'm not sure that's inherently much of a bad thing.
Oh.
Quintonio.
Rhett.
Next up we got.
So this was the dawn of bad takes us.
Got a joke.
That's not how you spell boring.
Spaceballs is boric.
Boric.
Jay do you think you'll be.
Yeah I think we got a I think I was right.
Someone in Chad is saying I'm from Arkansas and even I can count something
that I said.
So that's probably what that means for.
OK.
See I remember.
I remember.
Someone bringing up something about Galaxy Quest as well after I wasn't here.
Oh I want to confirm that I have seen Galaxy Quest and it's much better than
Spaceballs.
I love Galaxy.
I thought you were there for that because I remember mentioning like I love
Galaxy Quest but I also love Spaceballs so.
I swear it happened when I wasn't there but I can't be certain.
So maybe I just repeated myself.
I don't know.
This one's called quinted underscore bird.
Can you fire.
Not quite.
It's got a load up for us.
This one.
It's slow for me.
Oh facts and walk instructor.
He's so neutral.
Damn.
I do not like this.
So this is in reference to the gray blobs.
There is an episode of
I think this was when we were discussing how
about starter Pokemon and this is already a meme that exists and apparently like I don't know
because I don't know the fuck all about Pokemon really.
But apparently like
the other three do actually suck more than Bulbasaur.
Is this is this a true.
It's almost like I said it for a reason.
Oh well I mean I don't I already made it clear I don't care about their actual power
levels.
I just want to play the retard.
Venus looks like no beast old man.
And compare that to Blastoise and Charizard like oh.
But a lot of people just assume because of the element you know the type that they are
that oh Bulbasaur must be the worst he's just grass type.
I wouldn't know.
I wouldn't go because I don't know fuck all about Pokemon in like late stage and stuff.
Like I.
Yeah.
Just saying.
Makes an incoherent hismy statement consisting of objective fallacy lashing out when their feelings
channel is generally storming on opposition throwing insults ignoring contextual information
of bringing political agendas into a conversation about media when unnecessary.
I'm like hmm.
And then Isle of Man.
I'm sorry.
The splitting mask there is disturbing.
It is kind of disturbing.
That is actually kind of strange.
Creepy.
The tongue.
Oh God.
So for those who have seen Lord of the Rigs no matter what comes through that gate you'll
stand your ground.
It's movie Bob.
Run.
Also if they're not displaying on Discord you just got to click them.
As in those being annoying or just get my stream open I guess.
That's what I'm doing.
So there's this wonderful new movie coming out starring Dishonored Wolf Anton and Loke
called Hello All My Onwards.
Hello All My Onwards.
Holy shit.
I'm on the verb.
You are.
I really like the rhino and the hello all my onwards.
I really like that.
Goliath cometh soon.
I was a massive student cut my pizza.
Faggots.
Oh my God.
Use scissors or a pizza cutter.
Oh it's Starkiller base in the background as well.
You have even knives.
Oh it is Starkiller base.
Well how about that.
Knives are worse for cutting pizza than scissors or pizza cutter.
Knives are worse than a scissors.
Wait sorry what.
If you want to cut pizza scissors are better than a knife.
It's like your opinion.
Yes.
Ahoy matey I love pirates.
Pirates.
I guess that's a yeah.
Pirates.
Oh yeah.
Hi matey.
Hey.
Yay.
Oh this.
I'll just let anyone else realize the hilarity and sument from that.
It's not load like it takes so like these aren't loading I got a.
Middle mouse on the links are you are you are you putting into the chat or are you putting the image.
Are you pasting the image or are you pasting the link.
I'm doing the exact same thing.
I don't want to pop them up because to see each one of them I have to click them so they open up in a browser.
I imagine it could be related to the fact that there's so many now.
Maybe.
But I'm just doing the same thing I've been doing the whole time.
But yes so in a straight line at full speed the resident class could be faster than a tie.
FO space superiority fighter.
Here here's the thing there is no fucking way it wouldn't.
Well let's see yeah just OK so for those who aren't sure of what's happening.
The joke is that they say that anything that's small.
Small is going to go faster.
Like they just.
But this is space.
There is no wind resistance.
There is no atmosphere.
And look at the big fuck off engines on the back of that.
I mean we don't even go by that rule.
If we don't just say it's smaller there for faster.
Yeah like we don't go that way.
Have you ever seen something small and stationary I don't think you have.
Yeah checkmate atheists.
Snails don't exist.
No snails.
Yeah so like obviously this isn't this is from like a wiki or something but it's not.
Just frustrating how stupid T.L.J. is but you know.
Yes see that's just a JPEG image so I should just show up but it's not.
I don't know why.
Some of them are trying to.
Try to just copy paste the image and see if it comes up.
OK.
It could almost be worth just opening.
It's the same thing anyway.
It's because there are too many images in the chat it could be worth opening a new chat.
At that point that we'd have to start a new call right.
I guess but is that.
You could still you could still talk to each other on a call but be looking at the text.
Because it displays based on whatever is currently on Discord.
No.
So yeah I mean I'll start a new call.
It's not a big deal.
We just click on them.
Sure.
Yeah it's OK.
All right then.
So yeah when you bring me out can you introduce me as the dawn.
That's a good one.
Yes.
I like that.
This one's terrifying.
No.
I'm looking forward to it.
Oh God.
Oh no.
Why me.
Me and Jay paying full attention of course.
I don't like the poo poo.
We've been looking away from it.
Well yeah I guess both of us are but I think we're on board which is sort of you know.
We're like we're looking knowingly into the camera.
We.
Yeah we knew that someone was taking a photo of it.
And that's that's what's wonderful about it.
Yes.
There's a lot of checkered shirts there.
The new in thing.
Oh no.
That's the Photoshop job.
There's another one of those words where it's just like so that speaks for itself.
There's actually a couple of I love man is very successful.
Are you happy about that Jay.
Yeah that's one of my preferred means.
It's.
Beautiful.
I've not seen the source for this but things I do kind of care about both themes and subjectivity
just not when they used for what they used for.
If you catch if you if you pick up what I'm putting down agreement.
Yes.
Agreements.
Agreements.
Remember this.
Yeah.
Super chat says the rooster.
Super chat says the rooster.
See this is something that's happened since the dawn of time.
It's a very beautiful.
We're just continuing a long human tradition.
I don't know that.
I didn't know this was a thing.
One day they will do this up the people of the future.
I love man shoes.
Oh my God.
Draw feet on your shoes it helps you run faster.
True.
Oh yeah kind of like the whole Reebok pumps thing back in the day.
Yeah it's like why it's why a lot of race cars have stripes on them.
How rags gonna feel about this.
Rags and molar go to Mars.
He's definitely the woman.
I'm a I'm a fit ship.
Titson.
Rags and molar go to Mars.
I like it.
The dawn presents tales from the eFap by Bill Barr.
Oh yeah.
Remember when bag tins.
Sent a link to Gmail.
Gmail.
It's a link to Gmail.
What the fuck.
Why have you linked us Gmail.
That's a wrong link.
Oh it's a male attachment.
Oh well for this one you can just pull up the stream I guess.
I don't know how to make it stop.
Is that the Aiden one.
Yeah so when we told her about what Quinn said and she sort of just died.
A sequel Sony a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Classic Quentin.
That's insane.
Yes it is insane.
That's one of those quotes where the more you think about it the more you just.
Yeah.
Is that a meme.
We forgot when we were doing this.
Hmm.
I think we forgot to mention that when we were doing the tier list.
The it's only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Oh yeah that would be one.
It probably doesn't change its rankings but yes.
I agree yeah.
I like this one though.
I do too.
Protect attack.
Well that one actually showed up as well.
I feel no man.
I'll show you that.
But that thing scared me.
That really is that that picture that one.
Whoever that was who made that the f**king three legs.
Oh that's terrifying man.
I don't I think so.
Why is that the symbol of a nation.
I don't know.
I don't even know if I saw that.
What?
Bane Spider?
What?
I only adopted the web.
I was born in it.
Mooted by it.
This is just shit.
I was born in the web.
Oh man, being reminded of that stream is great.
Oh, that was such a crazy good stream.
I'm all at checking the spider milk to learn the run time of the next eFap.
24 hours.
This can sell the lactose.
I love pirates.
A little cosplay for total.
Wait, isn't that like the pirate from like SpongeBob or something?
Possibly, yeah.
It's because the ship is its own thing.
Then Banjo Kazooie is.
There must be that and total's face.
I like how jagged total's face is.
It's wonderful.
The suit will be perfect when it fits a critic.
Oh no.
I'm not wearing that.
That's weirdly good Photoshop.
I was actually going to say it fits well.
Good.
The colour scheme fits pretty well too.
No.
It's like you were made for this role.
I'm so sorry.
It made sense to cover Batwoman, I guess.
Wait, what's the order for this?
It goes.
I'm trying to figure it out.
I think it's right to left because it's a weeb colour.
If you want me to believe Fab is over, that's what happens when Fab's over.
You don't know.
That's when he begins.
Oh yeah.
Which is very applicable for the streams we were doing.
Yeah, that works really well.
Oh, I showed this one already.
I think we showed this one.
Biggittiest.
Yeah, I think so.
Still good though.
Oh, of course.
I've not seen this one.
Didn't hear something for him.
Imagine they make such a scene over silly stage play for children.
Or sooth.
They are going beyond nitpicking for the tale of their own sake, and they are in fact murdering the very concept of culture.
Fella countryman handeth me the hemlock, if thou will.
There's a guy in the background saying hi rags.
I don't know if the hand's like, hey.
Silence chess cup wizard.
Fucking boring.
Like the guy who's just fucking crying on the wall.
You'd think they would have attached a quote to that.
Tismy people rejected his message.
The last Jedi's objectively bad.
Shut up.
They hated him because he told them the truth.
Shut up.
The gender wizard.
Before I change you to look like a female, you may choose what female you look like.
You have two choices.
You can either look like a random woman of my choosing, or you can look like Brie Lawson.
Who shall you choose?
How raw response?
Throw some off.
I think people put a wizard hat on arrest.
Monday night raw.
This is like, this is almost worth, this is almost, this is actually worth posting to surreal vibes.
The gender wizards.
The gender wizards.
Oh wow, that's a big one.
Oh yeah, we got, we got loads of references here.
Oh wow, yeah, that's a lot to look at here.
Oh yeah, that's at the bottom left.
Fucking Diddy Kong.
By the way, to the left.
Oh fuck yeah, I'm a snake.
Oh man.
Who's in Samus's mask?
Samus? Is it Samus or Samus?
Samus.
Samus.
Who's in Samus's mask?
Oh yeah, it's really small, isn't it?
Oh gee, I can't make it out.
Yeah, I don't know who that is.
I've got the spider.
Kathleen, Kendi, Ryan, Johnson.
I would play this game.
Patrick, Joseph.
It's a great shad face, they've chosen for that.
I'm guessing that's me as Peach.
Ice Climbers are, oh of course, Eric and Jack Saint.
That woman is Bayonetta.
Oh no.
Theo's Young Link.
Southpaw's Ryu.
Doomcock is, I guess that's Gannett?
Wolf is Wolf.
Ike is that guy.
I think Filmbob is Sonic, right?
I think that's, yeah, Filmbro.
Filmbro.
I like Joseph Anderson's Ridley.
Wolf is Wolf, yeah.
Jay Longbone is the Inkling.
I'm using a long sword.
Yeah, it says long.
It makes sense that Joseph Anderson's Ridley and Martha's shad.
Mahler is...
Quinton's Bowser.
Robot-headed Mega Man.
That makes sense, some of these are pretty good.
Yeah, I like it.
Where's Nerdrotic and Drinker? I don't know.
Terrible castle design.
Oh god, Karl Marx is leading the Pikmin NPCs.
In the middle, right beneath Jay.
And the cosmic chicken is in the heart of it all.
There he is, I see him.
Oh yeah, the cosmic chicken.
I love it.
That's a good one, I like that.
I like how they weren't just randomly posted on.
There is some sense to them.
I like the shad meme.
This is pretty referential.
Yeah, everyone was like, Yasm was just...
Yeah, this is good.
I like this one.
I know a lot of people in chat were mentioning something pretty similar to this.
Chat is a character again.
Why is everyone spelling it like that?
Was there something about that that we said? I don't remember.
So not so great debate.
Say he's old again.
Say he's old again, I dare you.
I double dare you, motherfucker.
Say he's old one, god damn time.
Poor Wolf, dealing with that.
This is apparently a character design from Code Vein.
Oh my god, it's you.
You're also in Fortnite by that logic.
Oh, neat.
I don't mind being able to tell.
So this is...
That's not the only one I've seen.
Well, Mexican Halloween is a thing, I think.
It was like the same logo and everything, but a poster.
This could be used for stuff like a graphic.
It's the Buffy form.
Oh yeah, it's slapped over stuff really easy.
Yep.
Good tisms.
I think Ra will like this one if you were here.
Oh no.
Now that, I can get behind that.
That seems about right.
I believe it.
It's a shamejerker doesn't throw out a roof.
Subjective!
That's transparent too.
Yeah, it could be used for some stuff.
I think so.
Phew.
How many times do I have to teach this lesson all bad?
It's Yesen's Legacy, I suppose.
Yesen's Legacy.
So this is Forza Horizon 4.
I got themselves an Efap card that has a mailer rag that's bringing in Teotree on it.
Teotree, I guess.
Looking sexy.
What will happen in the Efap card?
It's kind of nifty. You could put custom stickers and stuff on.
Wait, is that...
Oh, that's a game.
Yes, it's not a real card.
It took me a second.
It took me a second because someone actually got back to their fucking card.
Then you were like, oh, there's a big logo that says Forza Horizon 4.
It's also the Lettuce 6 on Efap.
Oh, yeah!
Yesen was truly Major Lee in disguise.
Or he was someone in disguise, for sure about it.
Got another Movie Bob killing guests meme.
Stop it, Movie Bob.
Jay, you'll appreciate this.
Clorums.
It's Jay Ode.
I don't know why this can't be a card.
There's no context to that. It's just me as a meme.
I mean, there's enough for them to work with. I can see it.
It's a good part. It's a quality part.
I love the idea that someone thought, I have to make this.
You woke up one morning, Jay Ode. Yes!
I like the Ros Felita to the Sun God thing. It's scared node.
Oh, my God. This is another depiction of Efap in an older state.
Obviously, we're doing the modern version.
Chat's there.
We can pull the memes from shit in the U.S.
Oh, that's good. I like that one.
That's pretty funny.
Waskely Wags.
Wags.
Stupid squeaky chair. Fuck.
By the way, this is absolutely how real shotguns work.
Yes.
Oh, my God. That's a fucking map strive reference.
I don't know what that means.
That was OK.
That was a day of Minecraft YouTubers.
And this is like the one fucking show.
Oh, my God.
I'm so happy this is in here.
What does it mean?
Yeah.
The reference is just like the sign saying fucking liar is the reference.
Oh.
That's it?
Yeah.
I'm disappointed.
Yeah.
You're fine.
You're fine again.
I want to see people.
I just I was surprised to see it.
All right.
To lose friends and alienate people.
Quinton Reviews, Molotiero, ContraPoints, Rags, Sextal, Bred 2, PewDiePie, Internet Historian J Longbone,
Armored Skeptic, Turkey Tom, Ben Shapiro.
Ben Shapiro?
Here's the thing.
I fucking hate everyone.
That's everyone's a Nazi.
They didn't do anything with the piglet.
I haven't seen those friends.
That's weird.
I look weird as to talk about it.
Yeah.
Who is like on Quinton's team exactly?
Who's like his buddy now?
I mean, Quinton's on there.
That's good enough for him.
I'm sure.
That's good enough.
Remember when you made the comment right about him seeming to like be blessing her with his staff?
He does.
He does.
He did look like that.
Yeah.
That's such a well chosen picture of Ray too.
Yep.
I'm so cold.
So cold.
I like this a lot.
Sonic says, if you're ever bored, punch an orphan.
What are they going to do?
Tell their parents?
Thanks, Sonic.
Sonic knows this up.
You did it.
Yet another accurate meme.
Oh, Singapore build was better off with today.
I see this as an absolute.
Rags, you've been spotted in a store.
You've put on some weight and you're wearing a little.
I'm sure they're cold.
Is it like a shawl or a tie thing?
It's not a necktie.
Swapping out accessories.
It's like a headscarf.
Yeah.
Provat.
Is that? No.
So that's like, that's you.
Well, someone who can, someone who can speak.
That someone tell us what that means.
Because I don't even know what language that is.
I don't even know what language that is.
I'm going to assume Japanese or some Japanese.
Some, some Japanese font.
It's a kerchief.
Is that it?
Ascot.
Anchor chief.
And ask.
No, ascot are like around.
That's what Freddie wears.
Babushka.
Someone's saying I can vote twice.
So that's true.
So necker chief.
Necker chief.
It could be just one up top.
Yeah.
Someone said Japanese.
That's cool.
But what does it say?
All right.
Does anyone speak Asian?
The church of the toxic brood.
We've got James Moore, the Pope, the richest defabber of the toxic brood.
We've got the creamy sheaf Palpatine, the revered historian.
Beowyn, the skilled artist.
Both convey both veteran verbal terrorists and newcomer hate mongerists.
The kinds of deep themes that can, that mere words cannot.
Meme repository, the missionary.
His video is filled with Tism reaching far and wide telling the massive history of the toxic brood.
Oof oof.
Protector of orphans.
He definitely loves as much as his biological children.
Has low boat.
Has low boat density submits to the apex orphan incapable of being gay.
Allegedly.
Doesn't own their own blood.
Got left behind.
Rather controversial.
Revisionary.
They are the less controversial opposition.
Salad King, Ras, noble successor, and Jared Genesis, the unfortunate traitor.
I think that fits.
I think that works.
I think that works.
This is beautiful.
This one.
Someone's call it.
Someone's saying it's called moon runic.
If so, that's interesting.
Maybe it's okay for him to get killed.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.
The geode wings.
Oh my goodness.
No.
Don't look is.
Is a national treasure.
I agree.
100%.
Not the pirate head.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.

No.
No.
So much Photoshop work gets done.
What is this?
I don't know the source like thing.
Hmm, knowing the source would help.
Who could be the alien?
Vader who has been tagged with like all the alien things, one of the best gifts I ever
got was drugs.
I'm in danger.
I'm in danger.
Oh, they're using my picture of you.
Yeah.
Everyone should watch E5 Gaming 4, it was good shit.
Oh, it was funny.
I guess someone found this book, Jazz Rags and Blues.
Oh, by the way, I guess I, you could put this on stream.
Give me just a second here.
When I saw that originally, I thought it was very, very interesting that somebody had
brought that up because.
That's pretty good.
It's not.
It's better than I can do.
Yeah, that's what I mean by it's not.
I think that's an absolute win-win.
What's this?
Yeah.
Oh, that's.
That's my copy.
Oh, you have a vision of that.
I do.
I actually, I actually have that book and I used it extensively when I was going through
when I was learning piano.
That's why when I saw that meme, I had to do like a double take because I, I know that
cover so well.
Are you sure that they didn't rip that off your name from the future when they made?
I don't know.
I couldn't even say now the terminators went back in time to plant this into our home.
Do you have a green carpet?
Huh?
You have a green carpet?
Not at my house.
It says my my parents house.
Oh, that's where I grew up.
It's actually works.
It works with the room.
It's like a like a dark green.
That's a pretty cool shit.
And then it's not how acronyms work.
No, but it's you get what they're doing.
You get it.
It's cool.
Racist.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Still good.
We have one of these before this is a different version of the long man body pillow, I think.
Oh, and for the for the task about Laura, yes, I do know how to play piano pretty good.
I like the long man.
This is another long man with you.
Mm hmm.
And this is another long man with me.
And there's you.
Whoa.
That's a thing.
That's like the Meowth thingy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you said there's more than one of them.
Meowth being long is a thing and I'm okay with that.
I've summoned Meowth.
Oh my God.
There's definitive proof that Star Wars ripped off Robocop.
Part Sith Lord, part Robon Forcer, all pussy ass.
He's got soup in his hand.
Robocop the future of my cost.
That is good.
Sorry, Kat.
Just loud soup is just a funny combination of words.
Not normally the adjective you use to describe soup.
This is another Efab gaming for inside me.
One of my top five favorite memes.
Apparently in Borderlands you can come across badass Goliath.
Oh, yeah.
Though I think there must be some kind of clone or shrunken vision because Goliath isn't
that puny.
You know?
Yeah.
It's kind of insulting.
Yeah.
You're simply named after the Great Goliath.
One of the children of Goliath.
Wagzies.
I'm hunting wags.
Hunting wags.
They've gone through all of the individual season things to replace.
With wags.
Of course.
Yeah, I know.
That's just, that's it.
Another Efab gaming for reference.
It's the not so great debate part two 2019 colorized.
It was an ordeal to say the least.
That was something else.
I like how he didn't even say that, but well it didn't say that on the screen, it's just
the font was so tizzly.
Yeah.
What would you have us do?
I'm sorry.
Looks like a rat.
Make millions.
It says showtism.
Showtism.
But I mean, yeah, I'd watch it.
I don't know.
I'm just saying.
Yeah.
It's a pass for me.
You guys might be aware of this.
This meme got sent around where it's, well, they've just replaced it.
So people who don't know, it's just like, if a guy says that Kanto bite didn't serve
a purpose, then they probably don't understand a plot and theme work.
If they say that, um, holders plan was like just nonsense, all of it, then they probably
have a problem with men facing consequences for their actions.
And then if they say, and I love the J's on here, the Rose Tico character was useless
and poorly acted.
They racist and probably hate women.
This thing got around.
Just imagine unironically thinking like that.
Yeah.
That's what's so, that's what's so weird.
There are people who unironically like Batwoman and who parrot stuff like this around as if
it's really a thing.
Like they believe it.
It's like, oh, you don't like Rose Tico?
Probably a racist who hates women, you don't like a character in a movie and that's all,
that's all they need.
It's like they added, they added a fifth paddle, the sad face, like, oh man, well, I don't
know.
What isn't wrong with me?
Oh no.
I'm going to have all of the flags.
So that's, um, not actually the end of the meme images, but we're getting close.
Ooh.
Yeah.
I know.
I'm actually like, all right.
Next portion.
So that was one of the portions.
And angry Jew, if we had a lot, we all we took, yeah, Jenny's video got fucking ignored
several times for just better things, angry Joe and you know, all that stuff.
That's good.
I mean, I can't say this meme is accurate, but I still appreciate the effort.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now.
Jeb is my best friend.
We have both.
I think Jeb and the dawn can work together.
Friendship ended with the dawn.
Now.
Jeb is my, Jeb is pretty awesome though.
What a powerful tech team.
Return of the alpha.
These are all specific.
I guess the previous yesterday.
Yeah.
Probably yesterday.
Yeah.
Um, definitely this one.
Zach snidey is the guardians of the cool because it would be done.
You're right.
Yeah.
That guy.
What was it?
Insidious or.
Hmm.
What?
Yeah.
The demon bugle in that movie.
Um, I forgot.
I didn't even, I didn't even think about it, but yeah, that's the name of the demon guy
from that one movie.
Oh, um, yeah, well I haven't seen it actually.
So sinister is the name of it sinister.
Yeah.
Oh, I've heard of that.
That's the one with, um, Ethan.
Is it Ethan Hawke was in there?
I'm not sure.
He like lives in images and stuff like that.
And he eats children or something.
Oh, well, you know, that's right.
I love this.
This is great.
Oh no.
Wait, what, what is the little guy?
It's uncompetitive.
I think it was, he has an Xbox avatar.
Okay.
Um, I like how accurate this is.
Well, that's from troll hunter.
No, that's from Shrek.
That's from Shrek, not troll hunter.
Ogre hunter, if anything, do the wrong.
This is a reference to cyberpunk reference to the dawn.
True.
It's true.
It's a crossover.
That's right.
It's the troll.
Why not?
It's under like two of these have bad takes with very bad takes.
I can't believe that jenny's was worse than movie box.
Yeah.
That's awful.
It's interesting how everything she said was wrong.
She's sort of, I think she gets away with a lot of really hated statements because of
how the framing of all of it is to say it's just a girl sitting down talking about a movie
she saw.
What's wrong with that?
Why are you criticizing her for talking about movies?
Um, so you got Jane Nicholson, insert film here thinks it's more deep and profound than
actually is complete with pointless filler that doesn't add anything to the overall story.
Oh my.
This one looks interesting.
Uh, how many of us we've gone without memes smaller about four.
Oh God, I can't read it.
It just says bebo overload.
Oh, it's super tiny as well.
Yeah.
It's just, I saw this the other day and it's, it's much better quality.
Is it on the, the E fat on the discord?
Maybe I, yeah.
I must've copied it.
Grab the, the, yeah.
The thumbnail or something must've been there, but I mean, I still like it.
The trouble with memes is that there are no trouble at all.
That is a true
back to back war time style ones.
I'm not sure what's happening in this image that you're trying to say everyone goes fucking
nuts.
They're racing to watch the E-Faps tank is no longer affected by gravity.
I'll sell that realistic shot and killed 404 shot and wounded 1960 total shot 2364 total
homicides 440.
Yeah.
That's from the website that tracks the, that I was using for crime statistics yesterday.
Oh, Jeb, Jeb.
This is a Futurama reference.
If anybody needs me, I'll be at the Agri doll and I guess that's where E-Fap lives.
It's not untrue.
I will say, I don't like this one.
I can't believe that's an actual picture of Jeb.
I wish I knew the context of why he was doing that.
Yeah, someone in chat will have it.
Yeah.
If someone in chat knows, let me know.
There's an email game play one.
Don of war.
Yeah.
And that, that Dom looks like it was always there.
Good shit.
E-Fap 40k.
Um, this would be the, the Smiler Al version of the eight bit stuff.
Oh, there's ER.
Hmm?
I think that's ER.
No, no, Smiler Al.
ER is a color scheme and I don't think there is an ER one yet.
And look at this craziness.
Apparently Borderlands is kind of a fan of E-Fap.
I don't know.
It's just a fresh rat.
Fresh rat.
They're clearly inching toward it, I can tell.
Yep.
That seems like a trap.
Yeah, kind of.
That's neat.
I don't know.
I'm assuming this is something else's image of death, like one o'clock or something, but
if you want to apply me to death, I'm not going to say that's a big wrong, right?
But it does suggest things that are interesting.
Oh look, a Jamie.
Nothing.
Got him.
Oh.
Save.
Save.
I guess that's from, from his green, his shitty Kylo Ren mug.
Real epicry.
Epicary.
Oh, what do we got going on here?
Everyone's blue.
What is this?
Oh, so this is bloodborne.
It's bloodborne.
Yeah.
Thanos against.
Yeah, that's.
Oh, it was.
Oh, yeah.
Cause he had a sword, like it looked like, oh, wait a minute, that's not even a fucking
bloodborne character.
Okay.
No, no, no, it's not, but it's the bloodborne boss, the, the fungi man.
That meme is really good.
That took a lot of work.
This is the thing that exists.
Oh no, it's beautiful.
What we should definitely do is we should put it in a public place and make it a crime
to destroy it instead of throwing it right into the landfill.
Yes.
That thing is gorgeous.
I love it.
Make it a crime to destroy it.
It is important that this is displayed on the stream.
No.
So explain what happened here.
What's going on?
Oh my God, just replace the fucking color with little rhinos.
Yep.
Yep.
It's just amazing.
It's the most to explain.
I look like him.
I have to accept this fact, like I'm not, I don't like it, but it's true.
So you admit you're related.
Yes.
My God.
I could be, did he have kids that I don't know, I don't know.
You turned Celtic against me.
You have done that yourself.
I don't think he's actually against him or anything, but I don't know.
Could be this is when I was referencing how people go so nuts with how it's a reference
to a thing.
So it's okay.
But I said, what if two sumos just battled on top of a star destroyed?
They're like, there's a reference to see more wrestling.
Yeah.
This is like this one.
That's another one.
They could be a surreal me.
There's like three Efap chats.
There's so much concern.
Her eyes are so yellow.
Apparently she hasn't closed them in a long time.
That makes sense.
Totally.
She slept twice.
We got someone watching Efap with pizza.
Can't say that's a bad choice.
Good stuff.
Is that a is that a pineapple on that pizza?
It looks like it is, I'm afraid.
Oh, no.
What a shit meme.
I like how this meme is like POV from the pizza's perspective.
I was looking at pizza's perspective.
You can see almost all the pizza.
Well, yeah.
If you look down, you can see almost all of your stuff.
Oh, the pizza taking a selfie.
Okay, I can get that.
Yeah.
Pizza taking a salt sort of, I guess.
Well, if we imagine that there's eyes at the top of the pizza and it's looking down,
that's like mainly what it would say.
Wait, how do we know we're not at this isn't from the bottom of the pizza looking up
because the eyes aren't at the bottom.
Fucking dipshit.
How do you tell me where the eyes are on a pizza?
Tell me where the fucking eyes are on the top of the pizza on the top of the circle.
The pizza.
That's a circle.
Yes.
It's the top because that's where the eyes are.
You've upset him.
No, Jay.
No, no, no.
Hang on.
Just let's find.
Hang on.
This is a necklace drawing from metal.
He has entered the memes.
Oh, is that metal?
Yes.
I can see that.
It's a shame he doesn't have any eyes in his nose.
They're fucking massive.
I don't really know the context of this image, but it really shows where pizza's eyes are.
Oh, right.
What the fuck?
I mean, he's not wrong.
It does kind of show.
Get it up for chat.
I don't know if they're aware of this.
This is we're getting into the thing is contextually.
Nothing's wrong here.
If the pizza has been cooked in the oven, it's probably dead.
So the eyes would be eyes could be closed and they just would look like it's a creature.
That's what brings life.
Yeah, I was going to say that's not how it works.
But by your logic, Jay, the pizza has like fucking 12 eyes or some shit, depending on how much
it's been cut.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No.
No.
Oh, well.
So someone wanted to tell us about some more good rat.
It's a Halloween rat loaf.
Halloween rat loaf.
Oh, my goodness.
Imagine being presented with this and how you'd be like, whoa, that's you put some effort into that.
Some real effort into making that look as appealing as possible.
Cleaned off that.
Cleaned off that mousetrap, right?
Why?
That's what he.
I had to echo what a flavor is.
He's like a real rat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Southpaw's rendition of Critical Drinker.
Lego form.
He would do this for a known racist alt writer.
Reviewing movies.
Disgusting.
Man's more of a Nazi than Jay Hemler.
Mm hmm.
Somebody in chat wrote Jim earlier.
I like that one.
Taking one last look at my mess.
That meme is more sad than the actual scene in the trailer.
Just realized that neon cover was not fucking accurate.
Disgusting.
I'm a terrible host.
I apologize.
So there's a couple here of the 3D drawn ones, right?
So we're gonna have to get a bit of you might have to click these ones because some of them have video in them.
Right.
Oh, there's pictures you got.
This is wags.
I think burning a straw man.
There's the opinion holes.
Someone's raw.
Someone's throwing things off a roof.
Money and people.
Money and people.
That doesn't look much like people to me.
Oh, yeah.
There's people.
They're white, so it's hard to spot them, but there are little people.
It's just like, oh, yeah, they are little people.
Then you got the opinion hold.
I guess people get thrown into his little efap like what do you call them?
Sort of.
It's because raw super chats about throwing people off roofs.
Yo, is this drawn in a tilt brush?
No idea.
But there looks like it's brought in tilt brush.
It's really good.
I love these 3D ones.
I'm a farmer for this meme.
Or am I?
Is that an axe I have?
There are more of these.
But right now we've got this one.
I guess this is us in GMOS.
It's just Slenderman.
Crystal Bowl, future bowl at Wolla.
Yes, it was a future bowl.
Not the Great Debate 2.
It's obviously the movie poster when it gets released.
Like instead of Nike.
They're back for everyone who believes in objectivity.
Electric Boogaloo.
So, Rags, want to do some reading?
I would love to do some reading.
All right, so this is The Cosmic Chicken Part 1.
Written by Bagidious.
He says...
And that's where I saw him.
The Cosmic Chicken himself.
I was confused and scared.
But then the chicken looked at me and I was suddenly not scared.
I was calm.
He then said...
He spread his wings.
I am known as The Cosmic Chicken.
I was stunned that he knew my name.
I was fascinated that the legends were true of a cosmic chicken.
He continued...
You are truly a massive and a great scholar, my boy.
I looked at him confused and I asked...
What is a massive?
He laughed and said...
My friend, you have much to learn.
So yeah, it's official lore.
This is only Part 1.
This is only Part 1.
Where I could go from here.
It's intense stuff.
Yeah.
So I appreciate the meme.
But I mean, I'm totally on board with complaining about matriculations.
I say it in my episode 3 review.
But what about matriculations?
I would never throw them out the window for that.
Rawwood.
Yeah.
Maybe this is Raw wearing my mask.
Who knows?
I don't know what this is from.
But it says Happy Wags on it, which is good enough.
Happy Wags.
Oh, is this like a diary of a kid stuff?
Possibly. I don't know.
I haven't seen that.
I think that is.
Happy Wags.
I've been boarding.
I haven't been boarding in a while.
So sorry about that.
This is like me, but as...
I'm willing to let people guess what this is a mashup of
because I'm not entirely sure. I'm assuming an animu.
Sounds like it.
Looks like Code Vein.
Oh, it could be him.
With the whole neck thing that goes over.
It could be like the gas mask thingy.
Hmm.
Fair enough.
I assume this was created in relation to eFap.
But I don't actually know.
It could not be.
But I'm also cool.
Opinion Hold.
A good old logo for it.
The official eFap rig.
It's another gaming 4 reference.
This is apparently from...
Remarkable Republicans video.
I'm going to ask bisexualism.
Oh my God.
Arthur Fleck is a bisexual and this plays a major role in his breakdown.
Arthur's relationship with his mother has some Oedipal qualities.
That means, if I guess in chat, Oedipus is the guy who kills his dad and marries and fucks his mom.
It's considered an Oedipus complex, right?
Yes.
It's actually Freud, I think, who is...
Freudian.
Freudian, of course.
The idea is that we look for...
When a man looks for a woman, he wants qualities that he sees in his mother.
That sort of thing.
Let's see.
His imagined romance with his neighbor is an homage to how Brad Pitt imagined Edward Norton by his side.
And the minimal intimacy between the couple shows Arthur's conflicted emotions.
Isn't that backwards if he's talking about Fight Club?
Also, I don't know what that has to do with him being bisexual.
No, because it's a girl.
Nothing to do with being bisexual.
Next bullet.
Arthur clearly has an attraction to Thomas Wayne and Marie Franklin.
He expresses his attraction in very strange ways.
And last bullet point.
This conflict of his sexuality and rejection by all four of his romantic interests turned Arthur into the Joker.
Don't know what that has to do.
We should visit one of these videos again.
No.
That's for insanity.
Yes, we can.
The last one is pretty good.
I like this one, considering what we just read.
Oh, I remember that. Yeah, yeah.
Joker is a film about how Arthur struggles with mental illness.
He's shaped by the circumstances of society he lives in.
And that leads Arthur to become the Joker.
No, no, let's have our own narrative.
We've got another scammy idea, you.
Oh, God.
Jesus.
If these memes haven't made you want to go see Efap Gaming 4 chant, you've got to do it.
Perfect.
Just do it.
My God.
Subversive chieftain.
Oh, no.
Not Yerksky, the subversive chieftain.
He's dangerous.
Not Yerksky.
Um, this is from Meme Repository.
Oh, I saw this one.
It's beautiful.
I'd like to point out.
I like this chat and this this chat comment.
I used to think Remarkable Republican was a tragedy.
Now I see it as a comedy.
Yeah, this is Jay.
He got his video Total Party.
He did not resort to character assassination and insults to defend himself and admitted some mistakes.
While still feeling free to disagree and ask questions, Joe.
Jay chose to make friends, improve his content and show humility.
You can say Joo.
Hangry Joo, instead of being the big gay.
Feel like Jay.
Gio.
Aw.
What a nice story.
You need a Gio in your image there.
Jay is an S plus tier meme.
That's true.
I like this.
Even though it's not like I think that the other seasons are basic or something, but seven seasons were gifted to the race of men.
Who above all else desire quality.
But another season was made.
Oh, I'll see again.
I guess you were right about Fortnite.
I'm in Fortnite as well.
There you are.
There you go.
You have three fingers.
I'll get over it more than enough.
Yeah, you can grab.
Oh, no, you're like you're like Dale.
I'm like Dale.
So we got a lot here.
Efap Mitty reacting to Batwoman.
I guess I've got the Welsh flag on me.
Batwoman's got the Isle of Man.
And I've got the Bat Cleaver.
Bat Cleaver.
And she's saying, I'm a woman.
She's got the kicky legs on her chest.
The giddiest in the bottom left there.
Yeah.
And I'm not there.
Hooray.
Oh, yeah.
You can't really see the Bat Cleavers.
Probably fell off the roof.
You often.
I always said this.
It's nicely cut.
I'm entirely sure of what's happening here.
I'm Dr. Doom giving children ice cream.
I don't know why.
But it's important.
Who's that guy in the back?
Oh, ice cream man, I guess.
Oh, it's just part of that.
Yeah, I guess that's just part of the picture.
I was wondering.
Oh, God.
I am inevitable.
Episode died.
I have bullet.
All right.
We will be covering it.
It's going to happen.
We're currently living in a pre episode nine world.
You realize that won't exist for very long.
We're almost out of that.
Live it up.
Yeah.
I'm going to be in Washington state on the 20th.
I should see if I could at least still see the movie while jet lagged.
This is harassment.
Sexual harassment.
It's very funny.
Release raw.
Here comes the roof.
Like a fucking thing.
He throws it before this point.
Again, an episode for me as gaming episode for me.
This is not.
Oh, rags.
You have a lift.
Tresnik dictionary.
Tresnik approved.
Most trusted.
Years ahead of its time, better than my mother in bed Freudian.
Happy, adjective, sad.
And.
I'm glad we got this.
Are you sure about that?
Are you sure?
Are you sure about that?
All right.
That actually might be it for images.
No, sorry.
Well, meme.
No, no.
About 50 more came in in the last hour.
One more portion.
No promises on how long they're going to be.
But yes.
This meme is worth one quarter portion.
This has been added to my discord as a emote.
And I love it when it's used.
Is this.
Yes.
That's the mode.
It's very important and relevant.
Are you sure about that?
Someone created me in what I assume is like blender or one of the other 3D
modeling things.
Terrifying.
Say the least.
Damn.
Wonderful.
It's not too bad.
It's like an alien.
It looks like something you'll find an uncharted, like a little artifact.
Yeah.
It's like that.
It looks like Batwoman pre-hair.
What's the key to unlock your nose?
I want to make everyone aware because some people might not see it.
But this was.
Amy trying to draw.
I guess guy dancing in.
A guy dancing.
Yeah.
What in 1940s Germany.
That's fantastic.
Here.
I just want to read this out.
It's only small.
I think you'll like it.
Let's see.
Let's see.
Yo, what are themes?
They're nothing but memes.
That's what mauler deems.
So drop these schemes and listen to my streams.
And I even have a little dab.
Dab on angry.
Dab on Demi.
So.
So, you know how the batarangs are calibrated for Bruce's long arms?
They're not funny to me.
At this point, I'm ready to believe that Luke's fetish is getting assaulted by women.
I'm a woman.
Such.
Great.
This is a movie that's coming out soon.
I can't wait to see it.
Massive productions and in association with a disco far away presents a film by a fellow massive long man.
Mola rags.
Well, that's actually that's actually creepy.
Yes.
Genuinely really creepy.
It's actually genuinely pretty creepy.
I want to see this movie.
Oh, man.
I'm no I'm too spooky.
It's coming out on TV video to me.
Oh, no.
I don't want that in my house.
It's too spoopy.
Oh, no.
Massive productions and in association with the disco far away presents a film by a fellow massive long man.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.
I have the tiredness.
You do.
And yes, this is a rendition of the spiders seeing into the future.
Is that a little fun?
This one's one from a guy who draws scary drawings.
Oh, wait.
Do we cover this one?
I'm starting to think that this seems familiar or do we not.
This is no replies.
I don't know if I can do this, Alex.
Just think of something dope to say.
OK.
Hey.
It's a baby wavy.
You ever get a guy?
Hey, wavy.
Oh, yeah.
You ever be the guy that blocked someone on Twitter for a meme?
Get away from me, you weirdo.
You're a quack.
Quack.
Because he blocked some.
Yeah, he blocked rags because he shared a meme.
So me and Mel were playing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Someone shared a meme about me.
He shared one of my memes.
It wasn't even me.
Yeah, I know.
So we made a joke about her crap.
A lot of like telltale slash until dawn.
The Supermassive Games things.
Like you take a drink of water.
It'll be like the ocean will remember that.
You killed me.
You consumed me.
I think this is when rags has been given Daenerys' story.
And he was like imagining being with Khal Drogo, maybe.
I'm not sure.
He's a handsome one.
He is handsome.
Just what went through my mind.
You know my mind well.
Imagine being young woman.
What does that say to the left?
Grown damn pickle.
Someone actually drew that.
You're still a guest.
They did.
Grown day pickle.
Ground day pickle.
Ground day pickle.
Yeah, that's good shit.
You're still objectively a guest.
I think rags is happy about that.
Yeah, I think so.
I'm fine with being a guest.
Oh.
The moral arithmetic of Bigidius.
Morality is measured in the base unit of murdered civilian MC.
A bad act is positive MC negative units.
A good act is negative MC units.
As long as the person's total MC score comes out of zero or lower, the world is better off for them.
So killing into self-defense.
So it's like for a singular unit of murdered civilian.
So freeing a slave is equal to one murdered civilian.
Like, makes sense.
Petting a dog is equal to 0.01 murdered civilians.
You gotta pet a hundred people to kill someone, but you pet a hundred dogs.
Then, there you go.
Crafting memetics, that's 18 murdered civilians.
Being an orphan for murdered civilians, naturally.
Burning down a major city, depends on who's judging, obviously.
Touching a woman's map, eight murdered civilians.
Oh no, not a map.
The thing, Bigidius was way ahead of his time, what can I say?
He was a smart man.
The man had some ideas.
The man, Bigidius, he had some big ideas, you know?
He did, he did.
This is a wonderful rendition of the dawn and Joker hanging out.
Putting on a happy face.
Wonderful little rainbow in the background as well.
This is more from Mr. 3D Man.
I guess this is me and Rags battling with several Jedi of some kind.
Terrifying, like I said, but accurate.
I like how Rags has like Wolverine clothes and then I've got like...
That's because I'm fucking amazing.
I guess.
This is a cool piece of armor.
So the idea with this is like to take fonts from metal bands.
The hate mongers of the toxic brood are objectively good, in my opinion.
It's awesome.
That's good.
You can get them framed.
Oh yeah.
Like the spiders too.
This is for me.
This is obviously commentary on the fact that dentists know their shit.
And when it comes to Game of Thrones, I imagine.
Again, Ephab Gaming 4.
I really like this one though.
It's Father Furtier.
I'm going across to the alien.
I like the concerned metal ball face.
I got hacked.
Rags alien is outside.
Rags, were you ever the alien?
I was never the alien.
Never the alien.
Not a single time.
I like that you still got your shades on now.
Of course.
They never leave you.
I got hacked.
I don't know how this was constructed, but it's adorable.
I've got, I guess, a rags pillow.
On my seat made of Isle of Man flags maybe.
Yeah, I think it was the alien three times when we were playing this.
Yeah.
I got Church of the Dawn.
I believe this is Father Furtier practicing the Church of the Dawn.
Very good.
As he should.
As he should, yeah.
He knows his stuff.
Very holy.
This one is, this is one of the early ones for your street battle, I think, from the same guy.
Oh, yeah.
It was actually, what was the reference?
Yeah, it was referenced in Dark Souls, wasn't it?
Because of the lighthouse.
From all the productions.
I saw that now.
Ronald Sludge Village.
All the Sludge memes.
Oh, yeah.
So this, this one's a whole album as well.
You got Guestless, Hold On, Good, Bad, Good, Bad and Rat, Some Lizard.
What the fuck, Ragaziz is.
Isle of Bad flag is just chilling out.
There's Aiden, several rats.
Oh, there's Grimace.
Oh, whatever was Grimace.
Have you even got the Dolphin of the Whale fighting in space?
I remember talking about that, but there's so much.
The spider has Thor's hammer.
These even got a section for Super Chats.
Where it's just like a fucking pile.
A section for Super Chats.
It's like me just presenting it, I think.
It would have taken a while to do.
Yeah.
I'm curious how it works.
Like how you draw with 3D.
Well, like once you put the helmet on, everything has depth and it's way easier than you think.
Oh.
There's more as seen by others.
Well, I mean, it's not as easy to, to like, you know, be an artist.
Drawing in 3D space.
Yeah, absolutely.
Like it's just right in your forehead.
Wait, click it.
This is a lot more.
I did click it.
Oh, okay.
You're all drinking.
Through the Bay Bays.
Yeah.
They're all like very episode specific, like they'll apply to one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That alien game, that, that brought out a lot of memes.
I don't think I would have been able to call that.
Yeah.
Played that four times.
I love this.
So for context, me and Mel streamed Man of Medan or Man of Fucking Don't Care.
The way it worked was the way you make like you can just play on your own or you can have, you know, multiple people on the same PC, hot seat, it sort of thing.
And we chose that option.
Then it was like, okay, so name your individual people.
Now, every time you typed anything, once the letter goes in, it pulls you back out of like in the same way that, you know, you have to like click.
Like Discord to type a message and then click out of it to carry on with whatever you're doing.
You have to click back in.
So every time you type a letter, you have to do it again.
If you type E, it would like, if you weren't already into the thing, it would like delete the profile and send you back to the beginning.
Yeah.
And it would like, whenever you first click, it highlights everything you've done.
So if you type anything after that, you delete all of it.
Oh.
It was the most fucking infuriating system I've ever had to type a name with.
And I just love this.
Probably took like 10 minutes to just put in the names.
I like the happy ghost is in the background as well.
Yeah.
The Dark Souls of Venues.
Yes.
We had alcohol to help us get through it.
Yeah.
Madame Madone was fucking terrible, by the way.
So bad.
Holy shit.
Oh, that was really terrible.
Really bad.
I would, I would recommend until doing 10 times over before that game.
I don't know what the hell they were doing.
Like, I don't know.
Just watch the stream.
It's only like four hours.
Yeah.
I haven't seen the stream yet.
I mean, we had fun obviously, but the game itself is like, oof.
I like how simple this one is.
I love Jay.
I love kick Jay.
Oh, beautiful.
And then as a follow up.
Oh, Jesus.
Horrifying.
Oh, that is scary.
Imagine that running at you.
I imagine if like, if that was a cult, that would be the tattoo that all of
them at the time.
By the way, I just was like, I like the Dark Souls of menus thing.
Yeah.
This is me battling the Isle of Man flag, I suppose.
Oh, you win.
We got a lot of mileage out of this Isle of Man.
Oh my goodness, that flag.
Yeah.
This is all from the same guy.
Any of these 3D ones.
Yeah.
I think it's all from the same guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This guy's a tilt brush enthusiast.
I kind of love it.
This is fucking hilarious.
Fly, you fuck.
Good.
Yeah.
This is slowly becoming literally the sun god depiction as well.
Throws people up.
Well, that's what I'm saying is that it's getting, it's, it's coming along.
I want that.
So that was like my initial intention.
I was just thinking about smite when I, when I said it because I think it's
smite and the mummy.
That's how I know about raw.
This was made because for some reason you can't have a community without them
wanting to ship stuff.
But I make hour long videos so that I'm extremely concise and precise about
what I'm talking about.
So I find that infuriating.
I'm like, we should hang out more because I get the same criticism of what
I'm trying to actually be precise.
I can push that up a little bit.
Yeah.
I like that.
Yes, that's cool.
This is like a cool.
I don't know what the term is, but like a, what was it Jay?
You said you studied it.
I didn't say I studied it.
I said I did it.
I know I dropped out in first year.
I would never have said I got a degree.
You said you invented it.
You said you were born in it, molded by it.
You've got Darth Vader's respirator there.
I do with a skull, red eyes.
I've got the monster wheelies.
Even if apps up there.
So some cool shit looks awesome.
Yeah.
Next up, there's a couple of Pikachu ones that I got to make sure we actually
saw as in the artist Pikachu.
I think this one was like, I don't know.
I don't know how I found it, but I liked it.
It's like the tesla me eyes.
Then another interesting drawing.
We got, um, I guess it's Dale.
And he's got like a shad symbol on his.
It was massive cancer, but now he's got a chad.
What is Rah here?
Like an alien?
Oh, he's one of the hillbillies from squidbillies.
Yeah, squidbillies.
You just got belch for rags.
Belch.
Okay, it was massive cancer.
I like the squidbillies thing.
Drawings are cool.
Are they not?
Oh, look at that.
It's all rags.
I like that.
That's really cool.
I wonder if I hate everything's friend is aware of how much we've said wags
thanks to him.
Oh, I don't know if you've seen this Jay, but, um, I'm assuming.
Did I show you it before?
I can't remember anymore.
I've not seen this.
Well, then.
This is.
Geode.
The arts actually really good.
Yeah.
I guess it's like reference to a Steven Universe, but maybe.
It is.
Yeah.
You know, once you saw Steven Universe, you can make this character Jay.
This is me.
I'm doing my stream with Luigi's mansion and someone creates some art.
Oh, 25 year old long man.
Happy birth.
More moolah.
Strata by.
Oh, Strata Meyer.
I didn't notice it first.
Probably because it's made in paint or something.
Yeah.
It's not quite like 25 year old long man.
I like the Luigi moolah crossover.
I like how the nose thing is the key.
The keyhole.
I like that.
So.
Ew.
Are you squeezing the shit out of me?
I don't understand how this happened.
What?
Why is any of this?
I don't know.
I don't want it.
What's the context?
What happened?
I do not want that pizza.
Is it bad that the part of this that baffles me the most is that.
It's a road.
It's a road.
Look at your squeezing.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a concrete shit pizza road.
It is a concrete shit pizza.
There is context for this and we may never know what it is.
I like this.
It's a good shit.
You wake up.
E-Fab gave me four.
Lots of memes.
Yeah.
Speaking of which.
Yeah.
One of the top fucking memes.
That shirt was great.
There's no way when you drew that you would have thought.
Yeah.
This is going to become one of the.
It is going to become.
This is memeage right here.
That was a forteer's drawing apparently.
Yeah.
Forteer drew that.
Yeah.
Well this is I love you bods.
Humans.
Humans.
I just got hacked.
What the fuck.
Rags I think you've seen this before but it's still awesome.
I have.
Yeah.
This is a great one.
This is a gun on the top of this gun like weapon right there.
A gun like staff is a gun like weapon.
Oh this is really good.
I really really like this.
I didn't see.
The tism wizard tism wizard.
Oh I'd love to make the tism wizard.
It feels like you should be in some kind of game or show.
Important character that helps people progress.
Again back to the scanning.
This is a neckos drawing.
I can't believe this.
I think for those who haven't seen it before like why does.
What is the meme.
I keep saying I was.
You got to keep up with the lore.
Yeah.
What the fuck.
You missed one stream and you're going to be out of the loop man.
I buy it.
You know the rhino dollars.
In Don we trust it says.
The neat rendition.
There's so much I love about this.
So cool.
Oh that's great.
I love that.
That's really cute.
Everyone's just great.
All Aiden sleeping.
All of us asleep.
Really.
Jay is even there with his rhino milk of course.
This is I guess me as the Joker running from movie pop.
Scape the better narrative.
I love how angry he looks.
You come right here.
Oh look at the bell.
It says it probably says metal on it.
You can just barely see the E in the T.A.
Oh yeah.
Good shit.
I think I think we can all appreciate this meme.
Yeah what if he was one of the people that.
I'm sure he'd still agree it was better off.
She freed slaves.
Yeah man.
We live in a meta narrative.
I think.
It's this.
Pikachu's referencing tax on here like.
In the also.
Yeah yeah yeah.
I think so.
Because he uses that.
I guess he uses that little doggy picture on like Twitter or something.
Oh yeah yeah.
But he's like a psychotic vindictive evil stupid dog.
Got a little bit like.
Like I think it suits him so well.
He's a yappy little dog.
That isn't useful in any way.
Just makes noise and is annoying.
Yeah that's him.
That's him.
Follow up image.
I think running mascara.
Yes.
Adorable drawings.
It's funny how like we're actually starting to spread out into several known artists.
Among the.
Pikachu.
Yeah.
Pikachu.
And Ecos.
Beowyn obviously and.
I guess the 3D artists.
There's all these different like reoccurring ones the guy who makes the terrifying ones like this.
I like the eyes like the eyeshadow.
Yeah.
Underneath it the creepy thing.
I really like that.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
That's Eric Texan.
Yeah.
And one for Wolf as well.
I can't remember when this was made or what the reference is but he's got the pizza.
I'm not sure.
He's got his pizza though.
And I already I already say these Pikachu ones are very good.
Oh yeah.
Starting to get lots to lots of images to save kind of back up at home.
Oh wait have you seen this one you're right.
I don't know if I showed this.
I think I.
Hello.
Hello I'm away.
Oh yeah.
I guess this is sort of me looking reacting to the wolf what I think.
Continuity.
Yeah.
There's also also visions.
Cuteness overload.
Oh I'm dying of cuteness.
Yeah.
Super cute drawings.
They are very cute.
And then my soft lines very rounded to completely swap genres of drawing.
Check this one out.
This is a I think high quality like a high resolution once might take some time.
I want to click it.
Yeah this one's really good.
Ah yes.
I'm checking out chat's reaction.
Oh god nice cool.
So.
Rhino milk 100 percent on his wrist.
Hey that's nifty.
Yeah.
That that's really nifty.
The the savers light lighting as well.
Sorry just looking at it for a bit.
Is that such a problem.
You know just appreciate it.
Space.
It's good shit.
More has a stick like weapon.
This is another one.
I think this way slipped through the cracks.
Like I was given it a while ago and I never put it on screen.
I don't think so anyway but observe mortals as I say the M word.
It's Halloween suitable and it's got a fab of the belt I think as well.
The pumpkin is really cool.
Yeah.
Oh and yes this one.
Cold people were very happy once this was created.
Yes.
Ultimate showdown.
Man that Isle of Man flag because it doesn't have to keep rolling to stay steady.
You can do it on one foot right.
Yeah he's got a lot of balance to him.
But who's to say this isn't a still frame of him charging towards me.
I think he's charging at this.
Oh everyone's going.
Reference.
And none of us know that because we're not weaves.
I'm so disappointed.
I don't know.
I like I know.
I know enough.
To know it's a Jojo thing but I don't know anything about the memes themselves.
No.
I guess we've got to watch the show.
Yes.
We're out on the memes.
So right.
Have you seen this one.
Me and Mel have.
Yeah I have.
This is really.
This one is so great.
This one's really good.
Intense.
Good rat.
You're Aiden riding Goliath with me and Rags with the dawn is carrying an orphan while also carrying metal up the mountain as we reach the good rat.
Yeah.
Metal looks very medley.
I guess that makes sense.
That looks like it really fits his avatar.
You can see it right next to each other.
Those big eyes.
Those big eyes.
The eyes.
The lips.
Yeah.
The eyes.
The eyes are really the pepe eyes.
It's the sad lips.
But if there was if there was a.
I could make like an efap gallery.
These will be one of the ones that would like just be like a framed portrait.
There's been a shit ton of them though.
And yeah actually that symbolizes signifies the end of the images.
Really.
Yeah.
We made it.
That only took like how long was that.
Too long.
We are three hours in now.
Well we started with the meme rankings.
No no no but how long have we been looking at images.
A hundred.
Hundreds.
It's longer.
For some reason I looked at it right when we stopped with the tears and it was 100
minutes and then we started with the images.
Oh well I was gonna say I can get it down to literally the minute because I just have
to look at the first one I posted to you guys right.
I got a lot of scrolling to do.
But yeah those are all collected and I imagine.
I'll probably be doing more collecting now as we go forward with efaps but you can see
they pile up.
They pile up.
They do pile up.
Pile up.
That was an hour and 50 minutes.
Neat.
Of just images.
Just.
So how many videos are there?
Oh you know.
Like a million.
Two or three?
All of them.
All of them.
All of them.
We get like it with copyright probably but that's okay.
We're gonna be ready here.
Oh yeah of course I have to give you guys the invite.
Invitation.
Invitation.
Invitation.
Oh people have people been tweeting stuff to me.
Oh no.
More images.
Did you see the efap movie one.
Which is apparently already.
Efap the movie part one.
17 minutes.
Did we watch.
Oh.
That's like the Halo Mass Effect mashup one right.
I think so yes.
Oh we've got to look at.
Movie both made a dark fate review.
I'll have to watch that.
I watched.
The.
Critical.
I watched his review of dark fate.
It's not very good.
He says a lot of wrong think things.
I had a lot of people in my comment section say yeah but you're wrong because critical
said it was good and like okay.
Oh God no.
He doesn't even really make arguments though.
What's what's his best argument.
I think it's a lot of vague stuff.
Like unfortunately there's something about the kind of thing you guys.
I don't know that the film has great action.
The plot has some stupid in it but not like loads of stupid.
That sort of stuff something in my penis.
The plot is all stupid.
If we have a specific efap for like covering anything to do with dark fate.
I'll probably throw it in.
It's not a flashy video because like a lot of the stuff he says is the kind of thing
where we can't do anything about it.
Like I said with ones that are like we said we said about some of the stuff Jenny was
saying or we've come across it before I'm trying to think of like a specific person.
Where they say stuff we can't like if you just go I was boring it was it was this it
was this it was this wish like okay okay okay.
But some stuff he says are easy for conversation starters.
I just I think he'll reconsider his perspective on the film maybe eventually.
Also I'm collecting extra memes.
Yeah that's why I was a little bit.
Oh no even more.
Well we're going to continue on with with video memes.
But that doesn't mean we won't check some of these picture ones out at the end.
I'm still collecting them.
Because I got the HD versions of those other ones.
All right.
They got they got they got blurred in transit you see.
That's the internet for you blurring things.
I think this has proven that really are a long podcast.
All we do is look at pictures.
Really?
I need four hours.
Do do do do do do do do.
It's funny that I'm talking about this while getting a meme prepared about how there's too many memes.
I'm in danger of falling asleep at this point.
Well I mean you made it unless the pictures.
So I imagine the videos will probably wake you up a bit.
Like.
You know how you woke up very late.
Yes.
So like I'm energy and I could go probably go for a while.
You're the reverse of that aren't you.
I'm exactly the reverse of that.
I knew it.
I've been waking up so late that I've been waking up early.
All right. So our first one is if app meme Captain Marvel meets Goliath.
And I think I want to say this might be legends.
Who are you.
Show yourself.
I didn't realize there's noise coming from my head first.
For a thousand years.
Bound beneath these waves.
I have watched you.
This Goliath.
Yeah she meets Goliath.
Goliath.
Oh it's Will the Warcraft.
That's the song.
Only I can sustain you.
What is happening.
I haven't seen this.
He sees her reflection in his eyes I guess.
Oh sorry.
You.
You are nothing.
Nothing.
I am a god.
Holy shit.
Me.
Oh that's gotta be Goliath at that point.
Oh yeah.
I am.
Not a tentacle.
Something you need about a horrible tentacle monster assaulting Egypt or something similar.
I want to see that movie.
It's not Egypt.
It's a lady.
Did you say this was Warcraft?
It's not Egypt.
It's a lady.
Her name could be Egypt.
You have some weird names out there.
Her name could be Egypt.
And yes apparently this is Will the Warcraft.
Cool.
Pretty cool cut scene.
Yeah.
Give us the fuck that tentacle monster.
I don't know that Goliath would agree to date Brie Larson.
I don't know.
I'm just saying.
I don't know.
I don't know.
For a thousand years.
So you know what I want.
Apparently it's a mortal elf bargaining with an old god for more power.
Here's a proposition for you.
You're going to give me your jacket, your helmet, and your motorcycle.
Oh.
And you will remain here.
A prisoner.
The god of nothing.
I want to find out what that cut scene actually is.
Apparently it's Will the Warcraft.
I can't find it.
We're just stepping in the world of Warcraft.
Look at new Will the Warcraft cut scenes.
You'll probably find something.
And also we apparently, mortal elf, old god, you'll find something.
Yeah.
Boots, motorcycle, you know.
D&D amasses after all.
Game of Thrones.
A show with 300 characters in costume having sex.
That's all you really need to know.
You're the show that makes me feel dumb.
We're also the show that makes us feel dumb.
We screened the initial pilot for three of our friends.
All writers, all smart.
Got to the end and there was just dead silence in the room.
And one of our friends shakes his head and says,
you guys have a massive problem.
Oh no.
Massive problem.
He certainly didn't want to say massive.
When you were embarking on this, it was such a massive undertaking.
Well, they just throw that word around like that.
Holy shit.
Man, just right on TV.
Jesus Christ.
Just like that.
That's kind of fucked up.
Children probably watch this maybe.
Between that and your friends saying it was massive problems.
Yeah, that was a bad one.
That was a bad one.
God damn, dude.
I can't believe it.
Like, yeah, we say it, but in context it's always okay.
But they're just throwing it out.
But casual, disgusting, really.
So who here has seen the boys?
Me, me, me, me.
It's a really quick meme.
It'll be funnier if you've seen the boys.
Copyright infringement is costing Vought 1.2 billion.
Oh man.
That got me.
Really?
Really?
These are like a couple of small video memes, but still popping it in.
I don't give a damn how good that shepherd's pie is.
I want my bloody spaghetti bullet A.
That's a really good shepherd's pie though.
So this, I got copyrighted for using this song in the stream live, but that's fine.
Because this one will get copyrighted regardless.
It didn't stop us from streaming, so it should be fine.
I can show this now.
I was talking about it before, but I'll just show it straight up this time.
So this is called a very special eFap Halloween story, darkness faps.
I'm already screwed.
Back in the X hundreds, old timies, there was a town and then there was an old woman who lived alone because she was wounded.
What are we talking about?
I had to step out.
I'm just setting up the idea.
I want to watch this movie with you Rags, see what you think of it.
What movie?
I see that.
Darkness Falls.
So the idea, like I said, back in the day, really old timey times, something hundreds.
Back in the 80s?
Older than eight, 80 hundreds.
The timies.
There's a town.
There's a town.
All right.
I'm spooky.
There's a town.
Actually, wait, let me spooky music for the chat.
All right.
That's a reference.
That's a reference.
It's a great.
No, I know the reference.
It's fucking nibbled off penis.
I couldn't tell.
I can't help because you've been drinking.
I want to make sure that you understand the reference.
All right.
I put on spooky music.
I actually just opened another beer.
I put on spooky music.
So there's a town in the 18, 18, whatever.
I can't hear the music.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
I put it on the link to you guys so you can experience the spooky music.
Put a little watch together so we can all hear it.
You know what?
That's true.
I should put it in the watch together.
You're right.
Okay.
I'm going to put it in the watch.
Shit.
Where's the watch together?
Everybody look for the watch together link.
It's really high up in the chat.
Scrolling.
I have to scroll past the gigantic comment that Jay left on that weird
article.
Scrolling.
If anyone has the link, if you could repost it, that would be fucking good.
I just put it at the border.
I've just fucking done that.
Good.
I'm using it.
All right.
What if this, what if the spooky music's copyright?
Well, if you're talking over, it means that it won't get copyrighted.
As long as, as long as there's never a time where someone isn't talking,
we will be fine as long as someone's talking.
Okay.
To go and do a thing, you guys are going to take over for me.
Okay.
So I'm, I'm playing it again.
All right.
Here's a spooky music.
Okay.
So in this town, in the 18 thingies, old, old Tisms is there's a town who
love their townness.
They're like, Oh, we're such a good town.
Town is great.
And then there's this woman who got injured by a thing.
I can't remember what it was, but she wears a porcelain mask over half of, no,
her face because her face is all fucked up from being injured.
But because she's so sad about being like, Oh no, no one likes me anymore.
She says, Hey, because this is old timey town and no one's ever heard of her
tooth fairy.
She's like, Hey, Hey kids, if ever you leave a child tooth, you know, because
losing an adult tooth is embarrassing.
Losing a child tooth though, that's normal.
So if you lose a child to you come to me and I give you a little coin, a little
coin.
And it's a cool little thing.
You interact with the kids and, and, and she gives them some money and she, you
know, it's all great.
So picture town forest house.
And that's where she is.
And so one day these two little kids, they, the house is like out of town.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cause she, you know, she's ugly.
She, oh, she's disfigured.
She just disfigured ugly tooth lady.
Yes, exactly.
So she's, she's sitting over there and she's like, what do you want to do to her?
You want to try to?
Yes.
Uh, all of the, all of the things you just said.
Yes.
She's sitting in your house like la, la, la.
And then one day.
Is this, wait, wait, wait a second.
Is this the plot of the film you want me to see?
No, this is the history, the law, if you will, of the film, it doesn't spoil the
film whatsoever.
This is, this informs the rest of the film, um, which I will, you know, I'm going to
do it for eFAB movies just to see what you guys think.
No, let's do it.
Let's do it now.
We'll do it after the stream.
Okay.
I'm not going to fall asleep whatsoever.
So let's do it now.
Now, now I'm wide awake.
This is how you wake me up.
So one day she's, she's chilling.
She's knitting, whatever you do.
And she has a knock at the door and she's like, oh my goodness.
And she opens the door and there's these, there's these angry parents and sometimes
people are like, Hey motherfucker, what'd you do with our kids?
And she's like, wait, what?
And turns out two kids, uh, Hansel and Gretel, if you will, went to see her with the intention
of trading that their, their children teeth that fell out during the night for coins.
They've disappeared.
They've disappeared.
She killed them.
Obviously what else could have happened?
They've disappeared.
And so they, um, they, they put her on a stake.
They're like, this is a hundred percent.
She's killed them.
100%.
There's nothing else that could have happened.
But on a stake, they rip off her porcelain mask.
By the way, his skin, very sensitive to the sunlight and she's in pain.
She's like, Oh my goodness.
I wear this because it protects my fragile skin from the sun.
And as they set her alight, they put it to flame.
They're like, Hey motherfucker, you deserve this.
And she's like, you know what?
Town.
You don't gay town.
You deserve every one of them.
In fact, every time a child loses their last tooth in this town, I will come to collect
it.
And if they look at me, if they look upon my disfigured face, I will fucking kill them.
You understand?
All right.
Good.
All right.
That's very specific in the moment while you're being consumed by flames.
I can't remember if that's actually what she says, but it's spooky nonetheless.
And so she dies and she's burned and she's dead.
And she's all kinds of, yes, it's horrible.
She's ashes, all of the ashes in the townspeople.
They're horrified.
They learn that the children got lost in the forest.
They're not dead.
They're just like, Oh, Hey, we're here.
Hi.
I'm sorry.
We took a long, we're wrong turn.
The path was there and you know, fuck it.
We guys didn't do anything stupid while we were gone, right?
No.
And they were like, Oh my goodness.
Fuck it.
We, we saw a bread trail.
It led us to a candy house and we ate the candy house and you guys know, we just didn't
go the right way.
And so the townspeople like, Oh my goodness.
We, we killed a woman for no reason.
Damn.
And then fast forward to the opening set of scenes of the movie.
And there's a child, a young boy who's lost his last child's tooth.
And he puts it under his pillow because that's what we all do when we're younger.
And we're like, Hey, mom, dad, give me some money so I can buy some, some stuff.
For the money and a creepy things happen.
And then, and that's, I've led you into literally the opening five minutes of the movie.
So that's, yeah, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Halloween is literally the coolest time of year.
Halloween's pretty sweet.
Halloween's so cool.
That was really good.
I really liked that.
That was really great.
We still have to see that movie though.
We do.
We'll lose over.
Mel, what do you think of it?
Oh, wow.
That's pretty good.
That's right.
Yeah, there you go.
That's all right.
Yeah.
Um, some, some weird tisms with the rules, but it's fine.
This is, um, the quick one, I guess.
Everywhere I go, I see his face.
Oh, that's great.
I was hacked.
Oh man.
And hilarious.
That's funny.
Chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about pork.
He eats them.
He grills them.
They're all great.
I was hacked.
Yeah.
Oh man.
That's funny.
Chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about pork.
He eats them.
He grills them.
He grills them twice.
That's funny.
Chewbacca wouldn't give a shit about Porches.
He eats them.
He grills them.
He grills them twice.
Twice...
twice...
salt.
Porgs and blacks.
He's crazy.
Bye-bye.
Check out some of the YouTube videos.
See you next time.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh God.
Bye-bye.
Oh God.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
I'm Governor.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
hmm
off
the
I'm hungry. That's really good. I like that
Good shit
This is called efap in a nutshell
It's king of the monsters
Oh no, that means I'm gonna have to do some pausing otherwise we could actually go down stream wise
Oh, hey the the flash of lightning actually flashed onto their faces you see that
Oh
I'm looking forward to when our efap releases for this as well. I have to give it some time folks. It's coming
17 we have on the waiting
So who's gonna be Godzilla at this I wonder I
I don't think it'll be Goliath. No, it'll be the dawn
She screamed at that creature by the way
She did a very good job seems one there's more tonaled gases in chat
oh
The entirety I guess thematically that makes more sense it does and it is important to nail those themes people
Also, yeah, like I realized that by the way the with the amount of work
I've been doing stupid efap movies edits. It's as low as seven seconds
I've never seen it go lower than that, but that's video clip limit. It seems to be I used to say ten
seven
But yeah, I have to pause the shit out of this
I see jazz not great. I
Mean what's wrong with it the legs? I don't know it just looks not good. I'm ahead of you
I don't know about the legs. I'm a head
Yeah
You have response oh
Man imagine tackling movie ball Patrick Williams and Quinton if they did like a collab video
I
Just gotta make sure I'm pausing this is just all I need to do is make sure the stream doesn't go down
That's the main goal here
Who owns Godzilla as long as it's not zephyr we should be okay. No one owns him. He's king of monsters. That's true. Yeah
You
Know him running at that speed man with how big he is
That is good. You can't you can't you can't bring up. How big goes the other way you fuck up him
Oh, well the whole city is just gonna get fucked with some yeah
Yeah, then he finishes off with the radiation note down
Yeah, I was gonna say he like nukes Boston at the end of the film, but they treated it
So it's just like this there's fine
We're good. We'll come back tomorrow. We're rebuilt. No issues. The buildings are melting because of the radiation. Yep
If you remember
Jay and Mel will both know about this one. So
Talking about how if Ani was an actual dad in like a family life the t-800 then surely at one point
He would like break stuff. For example a toilet. You probably break
Yeah
I have a family I care about very much, but you could kill me. Oh, that would be so bad
But I've heard that a lot of people like it so what do I know? Mm-hmm. This is called the Battle of the Flags. Oh
Boy
All right, let's go
You want a piece of me
I don't want a piece of you. I want the whole thing
This is a is a happy Madison
Happy Gilmore. Yeah, Billy Madison, right? Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore. Yeah, Happy Madison is the company that makes the films. I think
correct
Gosh that's actually really loud. I didn't realize I'm sorry
I
Like the the older the film you go a lot of films have the fucking watermelon punch sounds
Again movie gotta pause
Oh
So what I'm out twitch are planning on trying to introduce some kind of
Watch together system that you can actually watch the stuff from Amazon Prime without it like live with an audience. Oh
That's cool. Like if that goes ahead
YouTube you better catch up quick cuz we're gonna want to do that
Watch batwoman with a live audience. What is shitty? Oh, no
It's a trap
I
Think you've had enough that went well, didn't it?
Now you've had enough so think that the dragon would eat the legs it wouldn't even be a thing you just be over
Well, it depends on how big the legs are bitch comparison to the dragon
fucking quinted face randomly
Hmm
Is you fap endgame part two
See how this Sony movie ones I was like, I'm sure they were gonna get hit with some kind of
Hopefully not struck out entirely
Oh
This is the 2014 one I
Am a muto in this case, it's a 2014 one. Okay better than King of the Monsters for sure
Oh
Hot experiment does not actually come close to describing this
Sound titty inside something
Oh
Yeah, just FYI so this is actually a clip from this movie
Do you remember rags metal that they say that King Ghidorah is making the monsters do naughty things?
Yeah, weird King Ghidorah is not even around in this film, huh?
Monsters fucking up everything
I think this film was intended for traditional reviewers and they will be oh, I remember saying that because if I
Patrick Willems said that a
traditional reviewers know this stuff and
There's the only traditional reviewer on YouTube is movie Bob though
I think he'd involve just right into that selection now because those two are buddies
Out logic as much as possible since traditional reviewers of the only people who appreciate
Patrick Willems and movie Bob and just write a traditional reviewers
Glad we moved beyond those traditions. I was gonna say maybe maybe the sub traditions. We should just let let go to a lack of logic
Yeah, I don't know if I like this movie more than King of the Monsters in terms of the entertaining bits
But Bryan Cranston is in the majority of the human moments or at least half of them in this film
So that's way better than anyone in the oh
They're all just the only good person they had is completely wasted
I wouldn't call waste. Well, he's half. It's kind of complicated. It's like a really he's like our main character for a while
So it's like good shit. They should have done the same with Charles dance. Fuck it. I know he's old
I don't know what happens to my presence character. Hello there. I've heard people complain about it
Yeah, because it was a really stupid decision
It's a shipping video I didn't realize
Why do we have to be giant hideous monsters what's that about huh?
You're trying to tell me
I
Fap okay. So the idea is the radiation helps the monster
Lay like egg things
Trying to lay if app is if I was helping it lay TFA part 3
I'm confused but all right
official music video
music video
So this is space efap just an ordinary resupply mission. This is kerbosh means I can play it in full
Thank the goodness
You see the thumbnails just got J's face Oh
22 tons of rhino milk sponsored by Jeff
music video
.
I really liked my rhyymid trap
I think we can all see what that, that's not right on milk at all.
Oh no!
The music is so well chosen.
Oh my god, look at it go!
Oh boy, he coming!
Oh boy, oh boy!
Oh boy, oh boy!
Oh boy, oh boy!
Oh boy!
Handling that thing is not easy, and quite some training had to be done to move it like
this.
It's available in Steam Workshop, just search for the Triskelion Terror.
So this one's go loads of clips from music, I don't know what's going to happen in terms
of copyright, we'll do what we can.
We shall do what we can.
Jump!
Hey Ryan!
Jump!
Oh boy, I think three seconds of that will get me in trouble, I don't know what's going
to happen with this.
This is all music.
This video is a minefield.
Do you think it's too dangerous or what, I don't know.
It might be too dangerous I think.
This might, because this one's literally music.
This might be when we...
Because the problem is less, because I can fight claims even though I'll probably have
like 17 on this Efap.
Just takes one, and it's a five of the...
Well I was going to say the worst case scenario, I get a strike and then the stream goes down,
which is possible.
It can take a month to clear a strike, so like this is not something that, you know.
Can we place this like for somebody else to watch in their own time?
Oh well I can link it I guess.
Yeah it's like on YouTube or some shit.
It's not currently in the description, it will be, you know when it gets reuploaded.
Also it's called Quick Play Everyone's Theme, it's by Coherent Ramblings, and yeah I would
put more of it, but it's super dangerous that's all.
Yeah it is, because the copyrightisms work differently for being live versus uploading
as well.
Because like YouTube's like, oh you're trying to make money off it?
And you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Fuck you buddy!
By the way, I'm gonna, hang on a minute, I'm gonna, do you mind if I step out for a little
bit?
Because I got some work stuff that came up, I gotta make a bunch of stupid calls.
I can step back in when I'm done, is that okay?
Sure.
No, we can't leave.
Oh.
Okay well, I'll just jump back in when I'm done.
So you guys enjoy yourselves, I'll be back in a bit.
Sure, sure.
This is a great movie by the way.
What is it by the way?
Blue Brothers.
Oh Blue Brothers.
Blue Brothers.
Blue Brothers.
Oh Blue Brothers.
I'm gonna have to pause.
Gonna have to pause, gotta be careful, even though I've already let more of them play
than I probably should have.
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Let's uh, let's quit this video, wouldn't it?
Yes!
That went well, didn't it?
Um...
That is a cool screwdriver.
Hello, man, what's this thing?
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
It's quittin' time, I guess.
It's quittin' time.
It's quittin' time.
As in, not to be confused with quittin' time.
No, no, no.
I was gonna say, like, you know, I was here for the promise of memes.
Oh.
Kick me.
Hahaha!
Actually, well, now I can't do memes, because chat's gonna be upset at me if I do memes.
It's quittin' time.
How long are you free for, Jay?
I'm free for a while.
Alright then.
Alright then.
Oh yeah, people pointed that out, you said you were free for a while, you stayed for like
10 hours.
Hahaha!
Well, that is a while.
Yes, it is.
Hahaha!
Hahaha!
It's the elephant musics on the other side of the door.
Hahaha!
Where did Kick Jay originate from?
I genuinely don't know.
Was it just Kick V and it got turned into Jay?
Yeah, I think it was Kick V.
As awkward as this sounds.
Oh, are you guys ready for some memes?
This is really good.
I really like, this works really well, this scene in Super Chat.
For Jack Saint, who doesn't understand that people who send to Super Chats also make memes about the Super Chats.
Lest you be yeeted and chat will bring great famine upon you, my goodness.
Oh no.
No pagans.
The elongated male critic.
Rags.
Hahaha!
My family hostage.
Oh, I love it.
What a great movie.
So I guess this came after the end of the Spoodawars.
I'm also back from the dead I found out.
I wasn't aware that I had died.
But I had died, and the chronicles, the chronicles of the epic Spooderman Wars.
It was, it was, but don't worry I'm back.
I forced myself back from the grave so I can have my Spoodawars.
Kangaroo Jack, oh boy.
Last time on Spoodawars.
Loyalty to Disney.
Loyalty to the brand.
Loyalty is salvation.
I like how everybody liked this when they made this.
Loyalty is life.
Number 14.
The aftermath.
Quintan.
You won the coin toss.
Tell him about the.
About the racism.
And the sexism in Star Wars.
So, um, here's the thing.
I fucking hate marsupials.
You know what, today's my business.
I would be a much happier person if we found a way to.
Ship is fine.
Ouch.
That's Dale, by the way.
Oh my goodness, he's Doctor Octopus.
Oh my god, they're all here.
Number four.
Four.
Racism.
Point of meaningless as an act of film criticism to.
Oh my god.
If I can shoot the laser beams out of my hands.
Pretty applicable.
Good stuff.
That guy would be toast.
Theme doesn't mean.
Spits.
Today's episode is inspired in part by a recently viral YouTube video.
But you're watching movies wrong.
You're watching movies wrong.
You're watching movies wrong.
So I fight ourselves as well.
You're watching movies wrong.
This is like a, like a poop.
You remember YouTube poop?
I know. Yeah.
I don't think SJWs are real.
You said that.
You want to keep accusing me.
You get sexual harassment.
Women.
Sexual harassment.
And you get to look at women at the same time.
Harassment.
Women.
Harassment.
Women.
Harassment.
Women.
Harassment.
Bring it back.
This would resolve cancel culture completely.
It's all right.
God, they killed Rhino.
So what is, I'm assuming this show is a specific Spider-Man cartoon or is this?
I guess, not when I know a person.
This is actually touching on a deeper pet peeve.
Sexual harassment.
Women.
No, you can like stuff that's objectively bad.
I really like some of the past.
Look at women.
Kick his ass for me.
Look at women.
Look at women.
You're a big wanted boy.
Sometimes they just don't like women...
Is that an argument?
Probably why you said that.
Sometimes they just don't like women.
Uh oh, people are saying F and oh no.
Oh no!
Stream take it down?
Oh yeah.
Oh shit.
Uh oh...
Oh, no, has it been suspended?
Yeah.
What's the other reason for policy violations?
What stream suspended for policy violations?
What's does that mean?
I assume the Spider-Man cartoon has got some heavy copyright.
It was either that or one before this.
Which which one would it have been?
I haven't got any notifications for it yet.
Oh, it's back.
It's back?
Yeah.
It can't be back if there's policy violations.
That seems very unlikely.
Someone send it.
It's back for me.
Yeah.
That.
You saw it say policy violations.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then just went back online.
It's just, you know, you stop violating policy.
It's okay.
But what?
We don't know what we did wrong.
My guess is that my guess is that it was like a live copyright ID.
And then as soon as you turned it off, it was like, oh, they've stopped doing it.
Is that how that works?
I don't think that's how that works, though.
I've never heard that.
Well, that would that would explain what just happened to us.
Well, no, give it a give it five minutes.
See what happens.
I'm going to load up my phone so I can see if it goes down again.
I'm gonna, I guess, use the loo.
This is yeah.
This was my concern.
Don't worry.
I'm doing it.
You violated policy.
You showed a bunch of memes in a video.
Gosh, this is why I'm always considered about games videos anyway.
It's not the part where we can't get the effect back up once it's uploaded to Moolah, because
I can wait on that.
It's about where it fucking kills my stream.
That's the worry.
You just want a separate platform to be able to stream the memes on.
I suppose that might be the answer at one point.
Maybe like Twitch.
Is Twitch Molynean on stuff like this?
Twitch, don't they mute your VOD instead of killing you?
Well, the only time my streams got muted or the VODs got muted was when I was playing
Third Age.
So apparently like music and stuff is pretty hard.
Like those got like muted all the way through.
Like the OST is like out taboo.
You violated the law.
I think there's background music in this meme that's from Amazing Spider-Man 2.
That's what some people have been saying.
Huh.
Oh my god, imagine striking someone because they use content from Amazing Spider-Man 2.
I know.
You'd think they'd have standards about all of this, but no, apparently even bad films
deserve copyright.
What's that about?
New feature happened to SFO this morning?
Has that got relevance to anything we're talking about?
Oh yeah, I'm not saying Twitch is fucking lenient in other things.
Efap would have been banned off Twitch probably by now.
I don't know actually though.
Mm-hmm.
But I mean, we're still up.
Yeah.
Speaking of still being up, I'm going to have to not be in a minute, so I'm going to have
to hop out.
Really, Jay?
Even though some videos are very relevant to you coming up.
Oh, fine.
The people who made them are going to be very disappointed.
They're going to put down disagreements.
You know what?
You've persuaded me to stay for at least 20...
Hours.
...isms.
What should I do about this video then?
Should I keep playing it even though it's the whole thing or what should I do?
No idea, dude.
Advise me.
I have to go to the toilet.
Ew.
Um, I just have to pause more maybe.
I wish I could play it for longer than a few seconds.
Chad, if that stream goes straight back to violating policy.
It's like, don't you play it?
Like, but...
Crap.
What the hell happened to Quiniton?
Quiniton?
I think, oh my, they don't have quotes.
Don't play it.
It's dangerous.
Look at Wibbit.
Bad lad.
Don't risk it.
I mean, the music's not playing anymore at least.
I don't know it was the music though.
True.
Um, but if that was the reason it was going down.
Feels bad, man.
If we just go through it real, real nice and carefully.
Jay you have to come up with commentary on every six seconds.
Um, brown table funny.
I'm being harassed.
You're not being harassed.
You're just being crushed by a fat man.
Wait, he's trying.
Gee, there's gotta be some commentary there.
I laughed because, um, the TIE fighter sound is perfect.
There we go.
I did it.
I said it.
I like to think Patrick Willems makes a TIE fighter sound in real life while he, uh, not
while he walks, only if he's like flowing, like if he's flung through the air, he will
make it.
Oh.
Trying to escape like a bitch.
Trying to escape like a bitch.
Hey, get your ass off of there.
That's a nice looking window.
Yeah.
Yeah.
YouTube harassment.
That's, that is precisely what this is.
Get back here, bird brain.
Fucking re uploading.
This is going to be a nightmare.
They're going to be like, no, no, no, at least if app 49 59 is sacred and safe, you know,
that's fine.
You're watching movies.
You're watching.
Women.
You're watching movies wrong.
You're watching movies wrong.
Movies wrong.
Movies.
I like that he had that tweet about like, oh, I don't regret saying what you're moving
wrong.
People taking out of context and I'm always just all like listening to it wrong or understanding
it wrong.
I'm just like, what the hell did you mean by it?
It's not even the worst part of the video.
And he gives you guys what to say that it's not, it's, it's partly a joke.
It's like, how could that partly be a joke?
That doesn't make sense.
That's not a, oh my God.
Wait, Vulture was a robot?
I guess so.
The music is on all of them, all of the song.
I couldn't even hear it.
Maybe I'm like really stupid.
Love drinking directly from the couch.
Oh, they're right.
There is a song and sort of like blanking it out because I'm trying to listen for the
quotes.
It's how is it that this is happening to us?
But he managed to upload this video without you think that would have gotten taken down
with all the music or because they monetize it.
My guess is that it doesn't hit that it hits streams with like a couple of thousand people
watching harder than it hits, like uploads that get, I'm guessing like a hundred or so
of use on this.
Yeah. I'm sorry, Mr. Spoodalwars, man, but it's it's too risky.
We might argue might get flumpled ingust.
There's even more though, like maybe this one doesn't have music.
As in this other one I'm looking at, I mean, the stream still up, so
that kind of does have music.
OK, listen, we can have it.
This is soundtrack.
What do I do? I can't play it.
It looks like a big tub of jello.
It does.
This discussion again.
I don't. The point is that all my work.
Beautiful.
I want to play more of a bit of super risky again.
How I don't understand how the stream got paused for community, whatever.
And then yeah, that's really weird.
I don't understand policy violations or something.
All right. I'm sorry, we're not able to check this one out.
Uh.
There's one for a starters, the thing for 40K.
I don't know if that has copyright on it either.
My recommendation would mean that's that's a that's a fan thing that was made.
I don't know how that works.
I think just a lot of these that are more risky record them offline.
Because you can't you can't get a strike for trying to upload something private.
You actually can. Oh, you can.
If you upload, say, for example, like a full episode or something,
you'll just automatically get strikes like, hey, we can see what you're doing.
All right. But if you but if you upload something like this,
it's clearly as fair use and you can argue as.
Yeah. All right. I'm here. I made it.
I think we had to skip over about three because the yeah, they're like
there's lots of copy tisms.
Yeah, we're not sure about this is like an E-Fap version of the 40K thing.
Oh, I start us. Yeah.
I don't know if and look how well it's made.
The image masking for a moment there.
Oh, so good. Yeah.
So I don't know if this will be the field.
Oh, that the field. Yeah.
Artificial pair of blocks.
They did say this is fan made, though.
So it should be all right. Yeah.
I hope they believe themselves to be warriors.
In my subjective opinion.
Actual arguments.
A review is nothing more than a description of an experience.
You're so titanic ugly.
This is a film about space wizards intended for children.
There's no arguments being made here.
A gun, the bark.
You're kind of watching movies, Ron.
Oh, wow. Wow.
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
This movie's a fucking mess.
Whoa, crosses that went well, didn't it?
Apparently, a bunch of people have that that went well, didn't it?
As an audio clip from this has been in a funeral.
What was really cool
is about that is that there's a there's a part where one of the space
marine's eye lenses starts to crack from the pressure.
And he had that on the glasses.
And I was like, oh, wow, that's a touch.
Yeah. And if this apparently this was made by one guy,
I didn't actually know that about a start.
It's go check it out.
Start is 40K fan film.
Is this a corridor?
Was the channel corridor digital?
Is that who it is? I don't know.
No, they have an episode about it about how cool it is.
But yeah, just a.
Pretty good shit.
And Gary does say that's a really good meme.
Excellent work.
All right. Very good.
Which pushes us on to more copyright risks.
I feel like you've been eternally scarred by that one feeling down gay.
Hi, mauler.
I'm probably Wolf and Rags, too.
But you want to know what didn't say hi to J.
What happened to you?
The dawn survived.
Tell him that me.
Because if these are going to be my last words, then you're going to listen.
Because the dicks about this to the Doctor Who stuff.
Oh, BBC BBC pulled a
think I think a 15 minute video of mine because I played that minute trailer
within it with or without the audio.
And I took the time vortex and poured it into his head and turn him into.
The God of all ether.
And I destroyed him.
This was on purpose.
This is a genuine response to this kindly.
Fuck you.
Hey, what's going on?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You are the.
Oh, no.
Since I've read.
Oh, I love it.
I can only play it for seconds at a time.
But I keep forgetting just pause.
Yeah, it's so good.
That's me.
Always that you are powerless.
Are you?
Oh, same old, you know.
What tonal really aligns himself with the tax and I don't know.
And Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, nice to see you.
Sexual harassment.
Survive that flame wars.
I envisioned myself as happy as I was the day Diablo 2 came out.
I'd spend the next six months in an orgasm.
You can watch this.
What?
Well, they go down and get all for fuck's sake, yeah.
Well, I think the solution is probably to
record it offline like a new like a mini, I guess.
We might.
We did the talk to who ones before.
How come we're not alone?
I guess they've just got more in about it or something.
They've you've I don't know.
You've drawn more attention to the channel and now.
They're you too, Ben.
So the chat just said copyright harassment.
And ironically, yes, it's all like with as if this is even remotely
the fucking original content, you know, stream suspended for policy violations.
He oh, there he goes back again.
That's so weird.
And now so the concern.
What is this?
The concern I have is that maybe you get three chances
to, you know, like three is the maximum time you can be suspended
before it takes the stream down fully.
So yeah, my my guess is it's probably not a good idea to carry on with them right now.
Yeah, because there's another.
OK, so we might do any fab mini form,
but I don't even know if we'll be able to upload them without them being booped.
But I guess we'll try.
Well, you have to put with being when you're uploading them,
you basically get infinite tries to cut out footage they don't like.
It's all I have to actually do it as a sort of
like put the eff up logo over it.
You know what I mean?
Like the same way we do with Batwoman.
Yeah, maybe that'll be the way we do it.
All right, well,
I guess we'll push on.
I'm going to have to I'll skip over any that have like
because there are quite a few.
This one was so good.
That's a shame because this one is really good.
Sad faces all around.
This one shouldn't get copyright.
Like, oh, don't you care about the substance of Wales politics or people?
You know, we have a cool flag.
Yeah, I think I love man.
That's a good idea.
Let's have a look.
Yeah. Islay of man.
Islay of man, flank.
I love these boys.
Why would you say that?
The legs will stick out.
That's three legs.
What does it mean, Rax?
Did you just say Islay of man?
What does it mean?
You put on a screen.
It's a screen.
I don't know what the stream is to see it.
You don't know how to keep it together.
You can't you can't lose to the pilot.
I thought after all we go through.
Everything puffed the weights to replace it with a foot.
You call it a squat?
It's three legs.
It's just three legs in like a shuriken's shape.
I want to see this creature rolling along.
If all of the flags were personified into creatures
and made to fight each other.
Oh, the Welsh flag just looks like this three legged creature.
It's got no face.
The Welsh flag will be just be confused.
Why do I have to fight this?
I mean, it's a drive that you probably need to watch.
It's wearing armor. It's wearing armor.
It's an armored leg. That's true. With stirrups.
So it's ready to write some kind of stirrups.
What are they? What are they called?
They're all right legs.
It doesn't even make sense.
All right, all right.
I just want to point out the super chat's relevant.
It's just a cheap swastika.
The problem is, you know, they're one of those kids,
they're trying not to do their swastika pose.
For instance, they just get it quite right.
And then they grow a third leg.
I feel like I would see that before. That's amazing.
That I remember that man.
Well, I remember that magical magic.
Oh, my goodness.
That stream was so, so amazing.
This one should be OK.
Only small, as long as I pause at least once.
Come on, you try it. No, I couldn't.
Yeah, just breathe slowly and squeeze.
I don't know if you guys have seen this episode,
but what basically happens is this woman is trying to get Marge
to be a little bit less stiff with everything.
And she started to fire a gun.
Anyone seen this before?
I think a long time ago, I don't remember.
I can't remember it.
Marge ends up shooting some cans that have been just conveniently
on this, this, this like a fence or whatever.
And as soon as she shoots the one of them, this old man comes out,
he goes, my antique cans.
Why did you do that?
He just shot some cans.
The. I hear it, I hear it.
My themes, which you can't do.
Which you did to him, which you did to him.
I love that it was Bob.
I hope stream doesn't get suspended for that.
Oh, yes, another one that's immune to suspension.
Well, who? Oh, Rex was able to shoot Bob's themes.
Yeah, when a homeless person is murdered, no one gives a flex
journey of self actualization through realizing that society can be tough.
Real cause of all of your problems is probably a one.
But because this is a.
I am just I am baffled.
I am absolutely at a loss.
Completely.
I don't even groundless.
No, no evidence is supported.
My mouth is just open.
I'm like a good idea.
Singapore will save us because this is a movie
that's only constructed to confer a sense of it's like he's an alien
speaking some intergalactic language.
I don't understand.
How could you even begin to think that's been hacked?
That was awesome.
I love the art style of that was fantastic.
I love it.
Singapore will save us.
Singapore.
And it's true.
So this is the man gameplay.
I'm pretty sure this is from a game trailer for a game.
It's a real life.
Wow. Is that a thing, man?
Hmm.
Rise of Skywalker is still standing for a little bit there
because we haven't yet been able to check it out.
Who knows how amazing it will be?
So, Jay, you may be aware of this.
I believe you may have seen it already.
It's it's quite the video.
You ready for this?
Yes.
Oh, no, I see this.
I'm aware of this.
That's you clearly in the film.
You know, it's like mass amnesia for kids.
Mass amnesia for kids.
Who the fuck is this?
The FBI.
I got to do this.
It's something that people can think.
I'm literally going to write that on my ego for like three years.
You're drinking from a yard.
Is that a dude? OK.
Did you do this?
That's kind of me.
Jay finally drinks right.
I milk off a G.
Yeah. OK, yeah.
You drink it off a geode.
So this is what you sent me, Jay, because we kind of baffled that it was created.
Oh, what is it?
It's fully original animation, right?
Well, I guess we'll play it first.
I don't like a button.
I don't want to turn the friggin frogs gay.
Do you understand that?
Turn the friggin frogs gay.
Boom, boom, serious crime.
I'm going to say it real slow for you.
Hey, frogs.
Oh, for your life.
Frogs, friggin frogs.
I don't like a frog.
I can't think of frogs.
Frogs, friggin
frog crap. Won't you fight the frogs?
It's not funny.
It's not funny. Real slow for you.
So you clarified, right?
And that's like an animation they made specific because of you.
I think so, yeah.
Like why?
I'm genuinely confused as to why someone went, you know, I'm going to do with my day.
But I like it.
I like the decision.
And I am thankful for it.
Then there is this legendary meme that
I think we all need to accept and enjoy.
Tracer.
We were taking some time to construct this.
Just.
I like that the community has sort of collectively decided
that the place I need to be kicked is my eyes.
Mm hmm. Yeah, they gave you the rhino bill, too.
It's a very important part of your character.
It's the world building.
It's about family.
That's what's so great about it.
Created by Joss Whedon.
This is called What Makes Good Rat?
So I think it's like a documentary is very serious thing.
I love documentaries.
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a student's
philosophical information or ASPE.
Today on ASPE, we'll be taking a look at a question that's played to the greatest.
Please be generic music that can't be copyrighted.
Please, please, please, please.
Minds in human history, said Biggidius in 429 B.C.
Macris, Antropos, Kakos translated.
We get the common philosophical question.
What makes good rat?
Before we work on answering this question, we'll have to define our terms.
First, what is good?
Many scholars believe that what Biggidius meant by good was reaching of a standard.
But that's just their opinion.
I choose to go with the third definition on Google, possessing or displaying
more value, virtuous.
So now the question becomes, what makes virtuous rat?
But what is virtuous?
Well, to be virtuous is to have high moral standards.
Obviously, there's only one definition of the word.
However, what is a high moral standard?
After all, Voltaire teaches us that morality is subjective.
In his book, A.M.S.
Homosexuality forces to learn before.
By a big case.
And if you will, if you will, the truth is correct.
And we'll have to be objective.
Often, murder is acceptable in my own subjective opinion.
This disproves objective analysis.
Where does that leave us?
Well, we have to ask the question, what makes good rat?
In my opinion, this works to our advantage as it is a fact that everything is subjective.
But what is an opinion?
Well, for that, we look to Biggidius teacher, that being Mr.
Freudian, in a transcript of the 512 B.C.
novel, and all of that, Freudian tells us,
or the truth is the lie of belief.
But what does this mean?
Well, in my opinion, what he factually meant
was that what we believe to be true is really just our opinion.
And so, we come back to our question, the question,
that which has come to symbolize a divide between the upper and lower classes.
What makes good rat?
Well, I think what Biggidius intended with this question
was to spark this very discussion, to make us realize that objectivity does not exist.
As Bilbo Baggins once said,
Jey wa roi-ing ki moi, biggidius.
That will have to do for this episode of Aspie.
On screen are some of the people who inspired this video,
and I highly recommend their videos on philosophical-tisms.
Philosophical-tisms?
I like it. It feels very inspired by Gedel, actually.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
This weird point where I'm like, OK, I'm really kind of tired,
although we're just sort of just letting anything wash over me.
And that was I was like, oh, OK. Oh, yes.
Beautiful. It seems this was very inspired, I think, as well.
So a quick disclaimer before we jump into the video.
Everything that follows is just my opinion, guys.
Now, I am going to make a number of objective claims in this video,
but see what I'm doing now is I'm framing them all as my opinion
so that you can't criticize me or say that I'm wrong.
This is called the film you hate is actually genius.
And here's why Dash NPC reviews.
OK, so remember that this is just my opinion
and you're not allowed to criticize me. OK.
Are we clear?
All right, let's jump into the video.
That new movie you criticize is actually genius.
And you're a bad person if you don't like it.
And also that old movie that you really like is problematic
and you're a bad person if you still like it.
A lot of people online, especially straight white men,
seem to be really mad about this new movie.
So they're spewing their toxic hate,
claiming that their opinions are objective.
And anyone who likes the movie is wrong.
Now, I could spend time talking about the legitimate flaws
and things that the movie doesn't do as well as it could.
But honestly, no movie is perfect,
except for Sorry to Bother You, because capitalism is evil.
But really, I don't want to get into this idea of the pop culture
blockbusters or even to be taken seriously in the first place.
Unless, of course, you really love them,
in which case they absolutely should be taken seriously.
And furthermore, there is no such thing as objectivity in art.
There are only better and worse subjective opinions.
Now, to talk about how great this movie is,
I might have to get into spoiler territory.
So here's your warning.
If you don't want to hear me recap the entire plot
in a boring and uninteresting manner, then skip to this time code.
So the movie starts with this, and then this thing happens.
And this person says, oh, my God, that's crazy.
And then this other thing happens.
And they're like, oh, oh, my goodness.
And then this other thing happens.
And then she doesn't like that.
So she says, hey, you stop it.
And then Captain Marvel twigs here from there.
And then he gives him like, I'm going to kill my way.
And the next thing happens.
And then the movie's over.
Now, a lot of haters and the toxic families of this intellectual property
have said that politics is ruining this franchise.
What I say to that is boo-hoo-hoo.
And besides, everything is political.
Therefore, a good film is a film with good politics.
See, these new movies have the right politics.
The old movies, let's just say they were a product of their time.
But also, you're not allowed to like them because time has changed.
If you still like something that was a product of its time, that means you're evil.
Now, another thing these so-called critics won't stop harping about is the plot.
They say the plot makes no sense.
And to that, I say...
And there you go.
And there you go.
And there you go.
I'm at one.
But really, like any sane person, I'm willing to forgive little tiny holes in the plot
because what really makes a movie is themes.
Oh, thank God he's got papyrus.
Now, as anyone who actually studied the art of cinema in filmmaking knows,
like me, by the way, good themes make good art, regardless of how they're executed.
See, this movie has really strong themes of hope and despair, success and failure,
life and death.
Now, I'm going to quote an intellectual, whether or not it's relevant to the topic
at hand, to show that my film studies degree wasn't a waste of time.
The analytical psychologist Eric Neumann once wrote,
all the objects of the outside and inside worlds are introjected as
and are there represented according to their value.
The selection, arrangement, gradation and elimination of the contents are represented
and in large measure on the cultural canon within which consciousness develops
and by which it is conditioned.
But it is characteristic of all circumstances to create for himself
a consciously, constellated and synthetically constructed view of the world,
however great or small in scope.
See, a smart person said that and I quoted them.
So I am also smart by association.
Now, there is one last thing I should probably mention about criticisms of this
movie, and that's the character of Blank.
A lot of people think Blank is a poorly written, unlikeable, nothing of a character.
And that's just wrong.
I'm not going to explain why that's wrong.
It just is. But more importantly, they criticize her for having no flaws
and no obstacles to overcome. I don't buy the Mary Sue thing anyway.
I found that I find the term sexist. You go girl.
Now, a lot of morally good people try to defend her saying that, no,
she does have flaws and obstacles to overcome.
But I'm going to take kind of a bold stance here and say that it's good that she
doesn't have any flaws or obstacles to overcome.
You see, Blank is a insert minority group character.
And if we said that insert minority group characters had flaws,
then we'd be saying that insert minority group were flawed.
And that would be bigoted.
I, for one, think she has no flaws to overcome because it's showing this
insert minority group community that they're perfect just the way they are.
And on that note, that's all I have for you in this video.
I'd like to thank my mega sexy patrons for supporting me.
My parents, their parents.
That wasn't real communism.
I was in 42.
Now I have become deaf.
Lirma, Lirma, Lirma.
Michael Brown, sir, is a funny name.
Mindless sick effect.
Oh, this is my favorite just right thing.
Skillshare for sponsoring this video.
Skillshare is a lot more.
If you like this video, please mail pallets of cash directly to my.
Thanks for watching.
And always remember, everything is objectively subjective.
So you're not allowed to criticize me.
That was amazing.
Please mail.
This is crazy.
Who are very talented individual.
This only has 57 views.
This must change.
Describing to you.
This is by capital O Opinions.
Yeah. Oh my goodness.
This is an amazing video.
It's actually I love this so much.
It was very enjoyable and cathartic.
Oh my goodness.
I would this is after all of the apps that we've done.
I feel like this is what we've watched like every week.
Every week.
Please mail pallets of cash to my house.
I'm going to put that.
I just like the skill.
She's a rule.
It's always skillshare.
The themes.
Oh, my God, we've experienced it soon.
I'm like the the themes that hit is just too is too real.
It's too real.
Another bit where he's like, I'm just going to quote
the fucking the whole bit was great.
Make more content, please.
I'm going to watch it all.
That's so good.
Like that's so good.
Oh, man, that was inspired by just right.
So there's probably a few more image, memes and video memes that I could show.
A lot of them are the copyright ones that I'm concerned about.
So I think the plan will be to try and collect them up and maybe do any
FAB mini forum of some kind.
Yeah, I'll see what you do with that.
Then and I'll catch like any image means I've missed.
I will attempt to recapture them because I know I've got a bunch on Twitter already.
But
platter.
Yeah, and some I really like, too.
They're looking looking pretty, pretty sexy.
It's pretty swag.
Some of them I'm just going to say that we're going to push on to
the super chats because I'm kind of editing to we're trying to end this
stream to see what kind of trouble my channel might be in.
I hope it's done.
Hooray.
But, you know, they're letting me be alive right now.
So that's reassuring.
Yeah, it's cool.
I love it when they let you do that.
Yeah, it's very kind of them.
But yeah, Jay, I guess if you're if you're
deleted in the head, you're welcome to.
Yeah, I'm probably going to skip away and.
Yes, yes.
Bye, Toodles. Bye bye.
Bye bye, Toodles. See you.
What a what a god.
Now we can fucking party.
All right, let's do it.
So there were two
chats that we missed when we went offline last night, Rags.
Do you want to know what they are?
Say what?
There were two super chats that came in after we went offline last.
Well, last year.
Oh, that's too bad.
We got to do we must acquire them.
I have.
Would you like to know what the first one is?
I would. Yeah.
Gay.
Well,
figures.
Yeah, fair enough.
Good stuff. I ain't going to say no to that.
And then.
We've got.
Don't let Jenny vote.
Raw.
It was raw. I'm so sorry, but.
There's nothing we can do about this.
It's a part of the law.
She can vote.
He can vote.
Not twice, though.
Definitely not twice. Just the once.
For once.
Oh, the the pixel drawing I showed was not.
Yes, I think I said I got something mixed up.
I'm trying to keep track.
I've got a lot of messages right now.
The toxic brood stands with you.
Apparently, there's some comments flowing on that guy's video.
Good stuff. Give me some love.
You know, man, like that video really was legit.
Excellent.
Yeah, it was really good.
And yeah.
Oh, and there's I've been getting messages.
People can sorry about the memes causing trouble.
It's not your fault.
It's never like I don't we're not you know, we know what we're doing with like
playing them, but you never know sometimes something slipped through.
So the rules are always different.
Literally, the rules for each and every
like individual meme or individual video or piece of music like YouTube is
different with all of them. Like I said, it's really weird that we've got the
we can play the Avengers, you know, like the Marvel opening theme in full from
the films where they show like the the comics flowing like with pages.
You can play all of that for some reason and monetize it.
Yeah, you're not allowed to play the Avengers theme for longer than like,
I think it's like that might be 10 seconds or so.
But yeah, I know there's a there's an influx of new stuff.
I can see it on the discord.
I'm going to collect them up, make sure I grab them.
But now I think we're we're probably pretty good with five hours of just meme.
Like, yeah, it was always been quite a bit.
Yeah.
OK, also, welcome back.
Thank you. I am back now.
Sorry about that.
You. Oh, you missed you missed a great video.
I'll send you it.
Yeah, it's been an hour.
I figured I was going to miss something really good.
We've sent people to it as well.
But you should check it out at some point.
It'll make you laugh.
It's called the film you actually hate.
Well, the film you hate is actually genius.
And here's why.
Yes, good stuff.
Everyone's going to be keeping an eye on him for future MPC reviews.
OK.
But metal, how was the sex?
Excuse me.
That's the first stupid chat of this stream.
James Moore wants to know how he sex sex.
Was it everything you hoped for and more?
It was like a three out of ten, three out of ten.
Could be with.
Well, just wait till you try it with a girl.
Oh, you got them fucked up.
That's going to screw it up.
You got to compare a girl's butt to a boy's butt.
Two e-faps in a row.
Also, a message for that bullshit.
Sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen, sixteen,
sixteen, sixteen, et cetera.
OK.
I don't get it, but I have a series that I've made over the years and I stopped at
episode 15. Oh, you told my idea box.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, so we get a lot of sixteen requests, huh?
Yeah.
I had a minute.
I felt really shitty about it.
I assure you.
I mean, we all do what we can.
Patience is a virtue, as she said, in The Mummy.
That is true.
People see The Mummy is a good movie.
Mummy is good.
I had ten minutes left on the last one, you massive.
That's right.
You can play both at the same time.
Get that ten minutes sorted and then play this one.
It's all good.
If he hasn't seen Blade Runner or Lord of the Rings,
when are we going to stop trying to save Jay and take him out back like old
yellow? Also, hi, Jay.
Oh, no.
Also, hi.
Kick Jeb, go.
No, never ever.
Never kick a Jeb while he's down, which is always.
Hug Jeb.
This means never kick him.
I'm going to chafe my Jeb from all this E-Fap and
or Fapping kick Jay.
Completely random question usually, but it's kind of a normal Welsh name.
I have no idea.
Doesn't even know.
I have no idea what the origins of of the name is.
All they could they could be from anywhere.
Oh.
Also, hi, Rex.
Hey, I should be getting into my new computer this month, gang.
The end of the meme drought is upon us, my friends.
Excellent. That's from the other story, though.
Oh, yeah.
This stream more than ever.
There's just apparently do what you can,
memers, to counter copyright because.
Yeah, because it'll hurt your meme when it's being played.
It will affect our ability to enjoy the meme.
Oh, maybe you guys want to come up with
like a like a list or PDF of approved music that stuff like that or try to use.
Like I know YouTube has a huge library of stuff that's cleared for copyright.
Yeah, and then obviously when you want
to reference movies, it's tough because you might have to use like a
a different version of them or a parody of them because we've loved a lot of the
movie references and stuff.
I'm just saying that like it gets if we get like a five minute meme video
that's all from a movie, it's going to take us a while to get through it.
And it'll often damage the pacing of jokes in it as well.
Yeah.
And funnily enough, we had a guy do what was that?
Like a three minute video of like paint
drawings and we were laughing our ass off of it.
Yeah, man.
Don't like don't be too considerate about making it like cinematic and stuff.
Like we love all the effort everyone's putting in.
It's just we're just really concerned about being able to show stuff in its natural
form, in its raw form.
Reviewers are saying the new Terminator is actually good.
Perhaps humanity does have a dark fate.
Thoughts?
Sad. It's really bad.
If anything, it's gotten worse in my head.
More have been thinking about it.
Bad movie.
Also, salutations, ragsimus.
Hello, salutations to you.
And the other pixel drawing I showed was not smile around.
It was PSA stitch.
But there you go.
It was like the all black figure with the white
face or white eyes and white teeth.
And I was like, oh, yeah, you can totally mix those up in pixel form.
Me, they took a week off.
I can get caught up more.
A frack you were doing a 12 hour on Saturday and another one on Sunday.
We didn't mean to.
Wasn't intended.
Accident.
Hello, guys, are there any film shows that you would consider nearly objectively
perfect?
No shows that I've watched that I felt that way about.
That is a really tough one because I don't watch a lot of shows and I don't
watch a heck of a lot of movies either.
The best we get is like seasons or episodes rather than a whole show.
The episodes, actually.
And then movies.
There's a handful that I struggle to find holes in,
but not many that I find to be 100 percent clean.
Like they have small mistakes or something
that are totally understandable for a massive production.
Yeah.
Massive.
It's like, well, if you have a film that's really good and then you go,
ah, but they let's say Lord of the Rings, you go, oh, it's that car in the background
and one of the scenes like so that could have been prevented.
Meaning theoretically possible.
That's what I mean by that.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
I will. OK, yeah, I'm breaking bad.
What about Breaking Bad?
I have plot issues with some of I think season three or four of Breaking Bad.
And I think some of the characters could have used
a little help, like Marie is a character that I look back on and I'm like,
what was her journey of five seasons?
She's a klepto.
And annoying.
There's not a lot going on with Marie.
I love everything with Walt pretty much.
I think it makes a couple of irrational
decisions at certain points once the gang bangers are killed by Walt.
There's a couple of things that thanks pretty great.
Yeah, no, I was going to say, by the way,
the Breaking Bad is my pick for like best objectively a TV show like I don't come
across one that has more consistent.
The production values in most aspects.
Buffy's my favorite, but Buffy's got a shit ton of problems.
They're just all in regards that don't damage my experience, as in
the characters are all intact for the most part.
Yeah, for sure.
Band of Brothers is probably a good suggestion, actually.
Oh, yeah, that's a fantastic TV show.
Oh, yes, you know, people saying Skyler.
Yeah, having her being annoying is one
thing, but is she inconsistent?
We'd have to look through it all.
They've been fine.
It's pretty damn good.
Yeah, same price up there as well.
I don't think she was really like as inconsistent as Marie.
I think Marie is pretty bad.
But I feel like maybe Skyler was maybe just a little more annoying than people
would have liked, you know, it's all like constantly hounding the poor cancer guy
who's obviously going through a hard time and everything.
And it's like I think they're kind of putting themselves in the seat like,
OK, well, he's got a ton of cancer.
Maybe I shouldn't treat him as much of crap as Skyler did, you know.
He's got a ton of cancer.
Yeah, he's got a ton of he's all over his cancer body.
It's crazy.
You can have different amounts of cancer.
So, yeah.
And once someone dies of cancer and they
pull it all out of him and put him in a big bag, they'll bag away a ton.
That gets wrong.
The suit absolutely is perfect.
It will be when it fits Jeb.
Yeah, it's true.
Batarangs calibrate themselves for him.
Oh, Walking Dead.
Holy shit, Walking Dead is terrible.
It's like first season.
Yeah, pretty good. The rest.
Fuck off.
Dances with Jeb's.
Hello, all my Jeb words.
Rags, I want to look you in the eyes when you poop with the door open.
I will not stop with these comments until my demands are met.
All right. Oh, no.
Is that a super is that a super chat?
It is every time an unusual threat.
But
I know, I know it ain't about the money.
It ain't about the money.
It's about it helps, but it's about the principle of I don't make eye
contact with people while I'm fucking dropping a stink pickle.
It ain't happening. All right.
It's fair enough.
Hi, Rags. It's weird.
It's weird for me.
Any thoughts on the Vittoria map?
It's OK.
I think that invasion could use quite a few tweaks.
The ending, the end section is way too easy for the attackers.
And the defenders can just be really annoying with it by guarding the last
villager. I don't like the emphasis on making a lot of players like nobles and
super tall guards and stuff, the less super soldier characters that are available
for play, the better it's OK, definitely saveable.
It's not like bad right now.
It's just OK, and it could be better.
They need to readjust the last position, especially.
And that's really my main concern with it.
Maybe instead of giving, especially now that the mortar on the wall point is gone,
but they should take away the whole making people super powerful.
I think it'd be better as well.
And I wish they'd given more cosmetics.
I think that's my big thing.
OK, sorry if it's been asked already.
Haven't been called the last stream yet.
No, I think that was entirely original as a question.
I tapped myself out with the avatar super chat yesterday, so I'll just say hi all.
And thanks for the content. Heart you, Rags.
Oh, heart you.
What do you guys think about the new Tyler Reiser,
a.k.a. Best, thick girl.
No idea what I would say.
It's a telly, a little eight lee, eight lee, a little for me real quick.
I will paste it to you so you can see it in its natural form.
I haven't played it.
It looks like a game.
Yeah, it's like it's like a JRPG, I think.
I think I saw it pop up on Steam sometime.
The protagonist is.
Pretty thick.
All right.
Yeah, she's pretty lovely.
Definitely lovely.
Also, chat, can I get a panda row panda row?
Also, I need this five dollars for rent.
Oh, well, well,
well, it's more important living someplace or giving super chats to us.
Please tell me you're showing the movie part one today.
I would love to see reactions to Jake getting redacted for YouTube super chat.
So is that the one that's like 17 minutes?
Yeah. Yeah.
I'm not saying there's a time limit, like memes,
but 17 minutes starts to get super long, man, for memes.
And we've got like millions to get through oftentimes.
So like 17 minutes is a pretty long, really long.
Yeah.
Like I don't want to discourage anybody
from doing whatever they want to do and everything, but
we like like joke heavy, short and sweet
angled memes instead of like super long, long narratives or anything.
Like don't you don't need to worry yourselves
and making like an actual movie out of stuff.
Stuff. Yeah.
I have it on the tab.
I will watch it.
More along man, bad people.
Level five of you are laughter, infectious.
Hi, Wags. Hello.
I think the T-800 named himself Carl.
All right.
That's supposed to help it.
I don't I don't know.
Actually, I guess he saw somebody called TV and he was like, I'll call myself Carl.
Ollie, Carl, Carl is the name I will use.
Also, would the movie be better in any way
if the T-800 named himself Jeb instead of oh, yes.
Oh, yeah.
Better. Oh, that would be so good.
Best of the series.
You're not allowed to insult if you haven't seen every episode.
And I knew Batwoman would be a terrible show from the crossover episode
before the show started. Kick rags. Hi, Jay.
Oh, oh, well, that's a new from chat.
Yeah, that's sort of the weird ass logic.
Like you can't criticize Batman episodes of having seen all of those.
Like, no, you haven't seen them either.
But you've come to the conclusion that they're amazing.
So what now?
Maybe maybe they have it.
Maybe they're like, no, it's actually terrible.
But I'm not going to say until it's over.
Marriage is between a man and a woman or two dudes.
All right, I agree.
It's either one of those.
Well, what about a woman and a woman?
No, no, not allowed.
Doesn't count.
Put Jay in the kick tier.
Oh, yeah.
No country for old Jeb.
You fat, you fat, we all fat together now.
Chase face came up with one bad from making fun of Jack Chase face as a long
man, bad origin. Nice.
Hmm, he does.
I don't know.
I do.
Tonal tier is beyond the barriers of blockage.
Yes.
Wolf's retired last three baby failed.
No, no, no, no.
Oh, no.
Sorry.
I was always next year.
Quick play.
It's the one.
It's DMV.
I don't know what Jeb's name would be.
The Benny Hill theme.
Well, he's running on his little mouse wheel.
Yeah, Jay's on his redemption arc.
He's the spike of a fat villains.
Yes, very true.
Be wary for the fap is long and full of massives.
Game of Thrones.
Where would you put us masses in the chat on the list?
Oh, if chat got on to the list in terms of quality, it's not a bad question.
Actually, I actually like that question.
A lot of the time they're the ones that
essentially enable the meme to live, they breathe the life.
Yeah.
It's almost like ranking them as.
I mean, I guess I'd say.
Hmm.
That's tough.
I mean, like there was a lot of great
Jeb memes like yesterday, you know, they kept going.
Like they can decide whether or not a meme lives or dies.
Basically, because he asked the audience.
I feel like they are outside of the list almost, or they are the list.
Yeah, it feels odd to rank them.
It really does.
And we're not trying to like, like cop out of the answer.
It just seems like a really odd thing to rate.
I mean, without the chat, the whole list couldn't exist.
Really?
It sounded like it was suggesting a tier list for every single member who watched.
Oh, so three thousand entries.
Cool.
So you recognize code gas in an old EFAP.
I was wondering what your opinions were about the show.
I liked it. I thought it was pretty good.
I thought there was some tisms in it.
Still haven't seen it.
Code you would also like to recommend WIM book to Wolf.
I will save that comment.
On the next, I shall visit his tisms.
I shall let him know to go here.
I'm surprised Big Jack Films isn't on the list.
Big Jack Films, Jack Films.
Doesn't sound like someone we've covered.
If we did, maybe I didn't realize.
So that reminds me, was Fat Man falling even on that list?
No, but we haven't really covered.
We covered a portion of the podcast he appeared on.
I don't know if that counts.
I don't know.
I don't think it takes more to be an EFAP villain.
At least I think so.
Obviously, we covered we put Angry Joe up on there, but I think we would have been
happy, like fine if he wasn't there because we have bits.
Jim Sterling should be in should be in B
because he's too big to fit in with all the people in C at the time of writing.
Also, I can't type fat.
You don't have fat.
Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Really? You can't type fat.
He typed F at T to say fat.
So YouTube blocks him from saying fat.
I don't know. Maybe.
Wow. It is pretty offensive.
It is pretty offensive.
The hardest choices require the strongest jabs.
Now.
Please do Jabs TLJ video before episode nine comes.
Oh, they mean Jenny's.
Jenny was tough, man.
Yeah.
Like Jeb helped us through that stream.
Big time.
A meme like weapon.
And yeah, you know, this is possible.
There's so many different streams we've got to get done before episode nine comes
out and ruins everything, because that's just going to be there's like another two
joker streams I want to do.
Really, I want to do a dark fate one, too.
And this isn't even including all the ones that are like guest specific.
So whoa.
Plus, you still got you still got
Jackson here at taxons video to cover at some point.
Oh, the the new tax video.
Yeah, I mean, that's not too much of a worry.
But the the other ones got to get them done.
I want to talk about more, more, you know, there's got to be a joker take out there.
That's not as terrible as Jenny's, right?
So yeah, there's got to be extra credits.
Didn't ask for the A tier.
They didn't choose it yet.
Tell Wolf he is missed.
Oh, I think after the preview of the stream last night, he's very aware.
Oh, yeah.
I recently discovered and I'm simply in love with rags, too, obviously.
Is it too much?
Great.
Is it too much to ask for my name to be in the Mueller archive?
If not, you have to say it correctly, though.
Have my peasant student money.
Love you.
Mueller archive.
Oh, what's the Mueller archive?
I mean, I could say it.
It's Johan Lund or Johan Lund, I guess.
But yeah, I guess that puts it in the Mueller archive to a degree.
Put Jenny Nichols on the error rank above S or a.
I like that everybody was very invested in how those places were placed.
Even we were, you know, getting those accuracy.
Why are we ranking brown table tree cycles up next?
Oh, I get it.
It's no man gaming equals stakes were ruined.
Olive is a weird grape that that the hell is a cherry tomato.
Oh, the cherry tomato thing.
I remember that that didn't last, though.
You know, the memes are like hunger games, like they fight each other.
It's crazy.
Some of them just don't make it.
Like I told you, Jay was very happy that Isle of Man made it and it's very strong,
but he was very upset that AIDS bust died.
Poor guy.
It lived on a little bit on my stream, though.
I don't even know if I remember AIDS bust.
It was to do with.
Oh, it was rags there for that, then.
I'm assuming it was.
It was the I mean, it was a party, right?
Was it you have gaming three or was it just a stream?
No, I don't know. I'm not sure anymore.
Not sure anymore.
What about Jared? He practically created the FAB memes.
I think it wasn't the creation of the FAB goes to
Kyle Ben. Wasn't that the first big, significant meme?
I'm not saying it's the first meme, but it was the one that kicked off the channel
in my Discord as well as like cataloging memes.
So.
I'd like to think because memes existed well before all of us,
you know, memes, they've been around since cavemen could scratch on walls.
Yeah, it's like I said before,
I think the very first meme ever dealt with before the Internet was around.
That was the I've fallen and I can't get up thing.
I'm sure I've mentioned that before.
That was a theme through like radio and television and shit.
There was Killroy.
We have like lots, lots, lots of super chats
left because I've been getting a bit tired myself.
No, actually, this should probably take about half an hour.
No, no, that's fine.
Oh, wow. Really?
Yeah, I mean, it's this only half an hour to read all over super.
Yeah, it depends on what questions we get.
List is missing Eric Butz and saw e-sports.
Eric Butz is a villain. Eric Butz is now he's a sweetheart.
He's just a sad person.
He's just a really, really sad adult human.
Let him have fun with episode nine trailers.
All right.
And I'm not sure who saw e-sports is.
That could be one of the maybe podcast because Eric is a villain in the sense
that he's why Star Wars get now. Yes.
He's the audience they're appealing to.
He is like fucking fat ass seals who will clap at anything.
That took way longer than expected.
More. Yes.
I mean, you never know with memes.
Surprised to be sure.
Still learning to be electrician.
If the circuit for my bathroom outlet is
objectively not ground fault protected, but I subjectively believe it is.
Can I drop a toaster into my bathtub and survive?
Try. I mean, if it's all subjective.
Wait, didn't didn't MythBusters actually
cover whether or not a toaster in a bathtub will kill you?
And it actually was proven false.
It seems like something they would cover.
But I always thought that it was like a
known thing, that that would definitely kill you.
I thought that was like certain.
Because it's like that's been a meme in everything for like it's been in movies.
And I thought movies like that I would never do. Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.
I remember watching the MythBusters and it's like it didn't.
I like it didn't kill.
And then like something else happened that it did have a test that then.
Well, you could you could measure the
voltage of liquids using computers and stuff.
But then you could see how much it takes to kill a human.
I figured we knew that part.
I thought that they wanted to get a baboon in the bathtub.
Oh, geez.
Baboon walls you, except maybe it might not.
Brown table, son of tola, tola tonaled sexual be thy harassment.
Petition to rename the second top tier Jeb like.
Well, Jeb like a Jeb like weapon.
The Griper Army versus Dan Crenshaw to
Noronite watch America first with Nick Fuentes knicker out.
I don't I don't even know what what is a griper.
I heard that we heard that on the stream.
Is that like a weird zoomer thing or what?
It's something must be a collective name for somebody.
I guess I don't know.
I think Fuentes his name.
Grrr.
I don't know.
Maybe some of the chat.
Tell me what a griper is so that when it's mentioned in the future,
I know what it means.
My little Jeb, G.I.
Jeb, the jabinator.
What makes good orphan?
Unicorns are just massive rhinos.
True.
Gears five sucks because fuck women.
Someone's saying, oh, someone's saying in the chat they found out that the drain
grounded the tub or grounded the water, so shock the dummy.
Oh, does.
OK, man, science is fucking cool, dude.
That's the big game.
So if you were like in a hmm, interesting.
Is there a scenario?
What about like old timey?
I say old timey times as if they had toasters as well.
But you could have an older tub like in the future.
Yeah, old tub.
Yeah, you can have an old tub.
That's got like the legs on the bottom.
The legs, you know, a little bitty leg tisms.
Also, it says the last word is censored.
I guess.
Oh, what it said, fuck women.
It just says F women.
No, no, no.
It's like an in joke.
The last word is censored.
He's five stars because fuck women censored.
Oh, also that if you were dating a guy or girl and it's all going great,
but then you discover they have a giant porg in their bed.
Do you stay or run?
Fuck the porg to assert dominance.
Yeah, you know, take away it's it's alpha nature, you know.
But they also would be like, oh, so
you like last year, huh?
Just that's cool.
That's cool.
Just, you know, all right, neat, neat.
Well, it's very, very possible that they hate the last Jedi,
but they just think that porgs are cute.
We did have that super chat of the guy who said he had one of those things
because he won it and he was trying to get rid of it and couldn't.
So you can just burn it or take it away from me.
Like I said, man, just burn it up.
It'll be pretty cool.
Burn it.
Burn it.
But I don't want to have a bush inside.
Oh, yeah, I always take care and check.
There's not a, you know,
it's just the tragedy when anyone is ever shot in the head.
They take the jab with them.
Oh, yeah, it's really it's really a double murder.
Every time someone shot in the head, it should they should be tried as a double.
Because it's really screwed up when people die and the jabs crawl out.
But you need that to happen.
It's a natural thing.
This is a lot of faith.
Yeah, they live in the forest.
Little jab community.
Also, I thought it was spelled porg,
but apparently that is something else entirely not intended for children.
Yes.
Hey, Mueller, in the tree, I sent you for the last name.
I included every reference.
Oh, for the for the the Smash Brothers image,
I think we probably got most of them, I imagine.
Very, very good.
Yeah, because I didn't miss anybody and there were some that we didn't mention,
but I certainly saw them all.
And I was legitimately impressed with not just how many there were,
but a lot of the times they were, if possible,
like thematically related to the character that their head was on.
Although I'd still really like to know who is in Samus's armor.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Who is in Samus's armor?
Because I couldn't really see is a big image.
It was well, yeah.
Like the helmet visor was like really narrow, too.
So we could really see is the eyes.
Yeah, I was going to say my Twitter is kind of stacked right now.
Yeah, I will.
If I if I get a chance to snatch it up, I will.
That info.
Where am I?
So many taps.
Zombieland was meh.
Go see it if you want more of the same jokes that run on too long.
A rushed third act and a Bill Murray scene that's worth the ticket.
Oh, you mean for the first one?
Because, yeah, I thought the first one was OK.
I haven't seen it's fine.
I haven't seen the second one.
YAR is the smash logo.
Perfect.
I started the first episode of Bat Bitch.
Wow. And I was so close to angrily shitting
Italian dressing diarrhea that I had to turn it off.
Here's for your suffrage, not yours.
That sounds terrible.
I imagine what that would taste like.
The visual came to mind as he's just sitting there in front of the two of us right
over a salad.
You don't want to watch the show.
OK, just watch our coverage.
Just watch our don't watch the show.
Watch us watching your self.
Don't hit like, you know, self harm.
That beautiful story rags read reminded
me of a story just as beautiful called Gay Bigfoot, a Mouthful of Sasquatch.
Oh, I could I would imagine there would be some some similarities there.
Oh, yeah, definitely.
What's your opinion on Watch Dogs?
I love the game.
Oh, game. Never played it.
I never played Watch Dogs.
Never played the first Watch Dogs was really repetitive and stuff.
The second Watch Dogs was actually pretty decent.
The stealth was kind of garbage in the sense that once you took somebody down
in a non-lethal way, you cannot move the bodies.
That's a problem because the guys can see the goddamn body.
So it like kind of almost unincentivize doing non-lethal in certain ways.
But you can like slip through.
Anyway, Watch Dogs 2 was pretty good.
It was a good attempt to, you know, make Watch Dogs one, like less.
Terrible, I guess.
I've played them both.
So I had a dream last night wherein I experienced the same story repeatedly
with the ability to make different choices and see different outcomes.
Man of Medan gameplay literally crept into my dream.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
Was it really that bad?
That implies the choices like matter in any way.
Most of them don't.
It's more to do.
I hate that when everyone's like, oh, yeah, here's a choice.
And then the choices don't mean anything.
And they just lead to the same conclusion.
I'm actually totally being harsher than you realize.
What I'm trying to say is when I say they matter in games like that,
what I mean is events actually change in this whole game.
Most of it just goes the same.
For example, it's like hide here or run.
And then you choose hide.
And then the guy goes, blah, blah, blah.
And then you go, oh, my God.
And start running away instead of just running away.
You're like, oh, yeah, just fucking pointless.
This is where we just play the cutscene.
It's the same thing.
It's like decisions that don't like that, that creates that create
a consequence that you couldn't have possibly seen happening.
That's something that's completely irrelevant to what you did.
Yeah, the best example I've got, man, is the plane with Alex.
He was chasing after a girl who was screaming and said,
you can take the fast path or the safe path.
And I was like, oh, that's obviously a fucking it's practically a dog whistle
for you're going to die if you go the fast path.
You're like, OK, safe, safe, fine.
Then it's like, you're too slow.
She's dead. You're like, oh.
And then the lucky if you chose fast and
died because you didn't go the safe path, just like, what the fuck am I playing this?
Like, this sucks.
Yeah, and it's it's not enough to be like fast and safe.
It's like, OK, that could go a number of ways.
Who knows?
There was a choice in The Walking Dead, the first chapter of the game
where you go to Herschel's farm and spoilers who haven't played the first one.
But yeah, it's like
you're supposed to like either like make Herschel happy or make his son happy.
And then, like, you know, you'll do something for Herschel.
It says Herschel will remember that.
But no matter what you do, Herschel dies like like a minute later.
It's like, oh, cool.
I can't I can't help but notice you're saying you're you say like a lot,
but you don't compare to things.
Huh?
Is that it? Wait, what?
It's right counting on the fact that you use it's great.
So you use like you say like a lot, but you never compare to things.
It's a strength.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just kind of using verbal crutches.
My bad.
Verbal crutches.
Rags probably knew that and he just wanted to make the joke.
Tripling or something.
Also, someone said how question dog whistle.
And I was like, oh, did I use that wrong?
And I guess technically, because it's more more typically used about politics,
I just meant a message that was concealed to a degree that only that's what I meant.
So like a subtle push toward that's probably what I meant to say instead.
All trannies want are equal rights and far lefts.
Oh, all right.
I put more the commander above maiden personally.
More than.
Oh, no, somebody corrected me.
Herschel doesn't die.
His son dies and then just boots you off the farm and he never returns to the game.
OK.
Either way, point this out.
Tism and or cousins, tism and or.
All right.
Fair enough.
Episode nine is almost upon us.
Hashtag toxic brood unite.
Hashtag toxic brood unite.
Absolutely. Toxic broods rise up.
Don't touch my toxic broods.
Supple you, Massives.
Just finished watching the last of work.
It was nice seeing a fellow wolf returned to Efab.
Also high rags and kick.
Hello.
Hey, got in the correct order.
I kick your thumb was nine.
The Thighs of Skyscripper.
OK, the Thighs of Skyscripper, Skyscripper.
Rags rambunctiously rescues Romanians rushing Russia.
None is the enemy of my enemy.
Howdy. All question.
Is a channel trailer good to have?
If so, should I do an accent or would that end up being misleading?
Also high rags. An accent.
I don't know why you would do an accent.
I don't see the need.
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, obviously everyone has an accent,
but I don't know why you would do an accent.
Assuming it's not your at all.
Yeah, unless you were doing a really specific bit.
But then the point of the channel trailers is to show what the channel is all about.
Right. All the channel is about being a character of some kind, I guess.
Yeah. Would you be playing a character or doing some kind of a joke or?
But if you're just doing standard good old
fashion, you're doing X content and you just keep the voice the same,
should be fine. Really framed.
It made it sound like it would do something out of the ordinary,
like make an accent and then just never do it again in the other videos.
So it's like, well, no, I don't see the point.
Can we get Jay to do a fireside reading of all
the Efab memes and lore behind them, have him dress up in a housecoat,
monocle and pipe, buy wags.
Goodbye.
I mean, I think he'd be on board with that if he if he goes to the
the lore and behind the meme section of the website and just explains the history.
While holding a book.
Yeah, more like, can I still like the Godzilla King of the Monsters?
It's OK.
No, yeah, you can still like it, but it's not OK.
It's terrible. It's not OK.
So like it, though, don't worry.
Has rag seen the Patricia Taxon video on him?
If so, is he planning a response?
Response may be on Efab, but like a long time.
It's not worth anything, really.
Yeah, I think
nobody so like with the video, we had a portion of the community telling us over
and over again, like, you know, do you have a response for these claims?
Like the the arguments, you're not really
addressing it, and it was always just like, OK, fine, we will.
We finally did. And then it was like, why did you guys think this
had any fucking credibility at all?
And I think because of that and the Jack Saint video that we are becoming less and
less required for people to see our response, they can watch the video, be like,
OK, yeah, just I mean, I've said this before,
but the biggest bane toward a lot of these video essays that Efab
provides is we listen to them like, whoa, because a lot of people watch videos
on YouTube these days while doing something else, and that's totally OK.
But a lot of the time you miss what people are saying
when you stretch them out sentence by sentence, you get stuff like, is the theme
of this movie that people shouldn't take medication?
And your eyes widen like, wow.
Mola, look at Jenny's video again.
It has people from your previous stream
and they're shattering her glasshouse argument about Joker.
People are going to comment on it.
She has a huge audience, so probably not that noticeable.
But, you know, be nice.
It's jebby nickels like was silly, said silly things.
She's not bright, but she's not like evil.
So just don't worry about it.
Yeah, don't worry. Don't harass.
It's like within a lot of the names.
Yeah, don't harass.
Just let it tism in peace.
But you're welcome to obviously disagree with her and provide a counter argument.
Or say you didn't like the video and everything.
Just don't be throwing insults.
It's the last thing you need, because then you get screenshotted,
quoted and you'll be you'll see this is what Mahler's fans do.
And that comes back on us.
The last thing you need to do is be like those people.
I don't know.
The copyright violations, it's over nine thousand.
Man, you went with that instead of one point two billion, really.
Yeah, I was about to say, damn, we have our own means.
We don't need nine thousand.
Yeah.
Mola, now the stream has a goofy pause in the middle of the stream
because of the violation.
I mean, I don't know why.
Usually they stitch them back together.
So hopefully it's so a violation did happen.
Two of them.
Oh, the stream got paused twice.
I don't know exactly what damage that's going to do in post.
The previous ifap is ready to go up.
I'll probably put it up as soon as this one's done.
This one might be delayed, to say the least.
Where are we going here?
Thanos used the reality stone to bring back the stream.
Oh, that's kind of him.
Nice.
YouTube being massive. True.
I'm laying down on my couch watching eFAB and all of a sudden it's suspended.
And I swear to the cosmic chicken.
I was about to build a roof just for YouTube.
If the stream didn't come back online, build a roof.
Don't worry, he'll stay for a while.
Ten hours later.
Yep.
Completely innocent question.
Will telling YouTube that eFAB is a five star content, have negative content
consequences for you? No idea.
When you when you're asked to rate streams or
I don't know what the fuck that does, I don't know if it does anything.
YouTube are more than likely having it just for interaction stuff.
I don't know if they actually look at it, but do whatever you want.
I doubt they look at it.
Anyways, thanks for sharing many fun memes.
Have a great week. Don't bless.
Thank you very much. Don't bless.
Don't bless.
Don't bless. Do you do?
Don't ask why not have the people who create
these memes pause every few seconds in their actual videos?
I mean, I don't think they're going to want to do that, but yeah.
It's just when you make a meme, please be aware that if you use copyrighted
material, we can't play it on stream and it's not that we don't appreciate it.
But by now we are kind of hoping that you understand that.
Yeah. I mean, honestly, as everyone's fully aware,
after those two suspensions, we're very concerned now.
This is the closest I've come to having Efap being knocked off completely.
We don't want that.
I don't think you guys want it either.
So do what you can.
What is this, the Gorka podcast?
Four Minute Breaks?
I don't know. I hope not.
YouTube violation, huh? Ra get the roof.
People really need that roof.
After watching RLM's Dark Fate review, I realized that they are Efap.
They are Efap will be another 15 years of suffering and cynicism
continued in part two.
Part two, Red Let Me Do just auto separates the beloved original film
films of franchises from what comes nowadays.
That's why they tolerate the rubbish more.
So I've seen the first half of the Dark Fate one.
I thought it was really interesting that Jay said something like,
you can either judge this as a film or as a sequel to Terminator Two.
And I was like, it is a sequel to Terminator Two.
Yeah, so it's kind of a strange film.
How do you judge the film without this
Terminator One and Two when the film relies on all the information of Terminator
One and Two? Yeah, especially when it starts with like
the two characters and the two two, and then like ahh.
I'm not saying you can't, like it's not possible.
You can totally do it, but I don't understand how you can make comments about
plot when you're missing several pieces of key information and you assume a lot.
It's weird to me.
It is strange.
That is a very strange.
Like good luck judging Rise of Skywalker as a film on its own.
That's going to be garbage, it's like nonsense.
Like don't consider episodes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
Well, yeah, don't even consider itself.
Gets copyrighted for grade A, under A for style.
That was the paint video.
I have to think this takedown thing is new,
because when I uploaded the Doctor Who meme, it didn't show claimed material
until the last minute. Sorry to put y'all at risk, though.
Yeah, again, man, it's OK.
I don't think anybody intends for this to happen.
It's just YouTube being tismy, or at least the people who read YouTube,
as in like BBC and whoever else Zephyr and stuff.
This is for Jay.
I think he's cute.
Oh, there you go, Jay.
Yeah, you left before you could say that.
Good night, Jay. Good work.
Sleep well. We'll most likely kick you in the morning.
Oh, Jay is the apex bundle of sticks.
Thank you so much for featuring my video.
Love making y'all laugh.
Bonus memes for any massives that translate.
He said love making.
Translate the Greek.
Translate the Greek.
You know, did he say something to you?
Oh, it was
it was the the one the what makes good rat, I think.
You mean at the very end?
I think so.
That was the Japanese at the very end.
All right. Yeah.
Well, either way, there was there was some Greek in there.
There was definitely Greek.
But yeah, I just I'm going to rely on you to have translated it properly.
I yes, I'm not good with my Greek.
I'm a little bit rusty, honestly.
It's all Greek to me.
Dass, well played.
Make an eFap meme using your Bobby will never be MLG video,
but replace Peggy Hill at the end with Jay since you since he left before you got
it.
I get it.
Nobody else does, but I do.
I give it a thumbs up if you get it.
I agree.
I was thumbs in the middle.
But it's Godzilla's birthday.
Acknowledge this.
Happy birthday, Godzilla.
Happy birthday, Godzilla.
I hope your next film isn't shit.
You did it. Please don't kill me.
You're older. You did it.
You're the king of the man's dust.
Sounds like you need to step up your game with him more.
Metal has high standards for a flop dingus, apparently.
I did everything I could.
What can I say?
He's an alien.
Even all of the alcohols and he still wasn't satisfied.
Yeah, I was hacked.
Sorry. He was hacked.
Oh, hi, Dass.
You missed the Shadman, shader man, shader man, I think.
The Shadman.
The Shadman partner.
And rag wolfs and rag wolfs.
Rag wolfs.
Oh, hello.
I'm part of rag wolfs.
Missed the live reaction to my drawing,
but I want to thank you guys for all the work you do.
P.S., thoughts on Angel's egg, if any of you have seen it?
Oh, Angel's.
I don't know what that is.
No, I don't know what that is.
Yeah, is that like
Angel is Angel, the show and like an egg is like a plot device or something.
Oh, I don't know that is not heard of it, though.
Hmm.
Passion of the Jeb.
Angel in Chains or Nirvana?
I don't listen to either.
Maybe he meant Alice.
Was it is it supposed to be like Alice in Chains?
Oh, Alice in Chains.
Oh, you said Angel in Chains.
You said Angel and my Alice in Chains or Nirvana.
Yes. Yeah.
I don't know anything about Alice in Chains.
I don't know anything about Alice in Chains.
And I'm just sick to goddamn death in Nirvana because back in Seattle,
like they would play Smells Like Teen Spirit at least 10 times a day on the radio.
And I'm just so goddamn done with it.
Anyway, but that's just my but that's just my.
Angel's Egg is an anime movie, apparently.
I have no idea. I've never heard of that.
Star Wars, that Star Wars Gill is Samus in that image.
And oh, OK.
They they're looking for a link to the Isle of Man meme cartoon video.
So whenever we look at the videos, you can see their names in the top left.
So that'll be a quickest route, though.
I will link that one in the description with the other two, I guess.
Like I said, you can always find them through their names.
If I can have a look quickly, see what the name of it is.
It's called more or less a comes to the leg.
And the channel is Bad Mems.
Bad Mems.
Spelt M E M S.
Normally, I just let this go, but given the time that went into the original,
I think I'll make an altered cut for the meme that you might be able to show.
Yeah, like we let me know like on Twitter.
And like I said, we'll try I'll try and collect up a bunch that will have to be
done for any fat mini and we can just do some editing.
Yeah, Goliath Saga 2 will be 95 to 100 percent copyright free audio,
as well as the footage being very re-edited.
So that should help the copyright situation.
That's from Meme Repository.
Oh, good shit. Fat.
Wait, what the fuck? YouTube does
just block random combinations of words.
That's weird because some people were saying fat just to test it and it went
through. Maybe it's just not for super chats.
Maybe it's like algorithms or shit.
The theory now is that it's that weird plus another word or something or in the
right order in some way.
It must be something.
I just said it just now.
No, you didn't.
Oh, damn.
That's P-H-A-T is different.
Oh, fat.
Hello, fellows.
Have you considered playing the forest for refab gaming?
I have played the forest quite a bit and I enjoyed it.
I have, too. I had completed it.
I had actually played it while it wasn't finished yet.
And then they released an update to where it had like a finished storyline.
There's a storyline in that game.
It's kind of cool. I haven't played it in a while.
I need to go back, take a look.
I know. I played it.
What a consideration.
I kind of like that idea, to be honest with you.
The score eSports was the OK sign is not OK, Vid.
Oh, so.
Oh, I remember that.
Yeah.
That happened, guys.
That was a thing.
The OK sign is not OK.
I think that the OK sign means you're racist and you're a white supremacist.
That's the world we live in.
It's like, of course, it's, you know, a green frog is racist.
Like, I understand that, but OK sign.
OK, take a minute to remember when it was not coming in the middle.
Nope. You're a racist.
You hate black people if you play the circle game.
Isn't that nuts?
It's like you got you got the sign that's been around forever.
But suddenly you're just going to hand it over to the so-called white
supremacists just oh, if they use a gesture, just give it to them.
Yeah, like, yeah.
Not way to not give in.
Well, just but not the white supremacists start drinking water a lot publicly.
You guys will be great.
Oh, oh, oh, they said about milk.
I guess you don't want healthy bones.
Then fuck you. That's why the premise we're talking.
White supremacy.
And yeah, about the whole fat thing, I think there's the rules for super chats
and chat are different, like, I don't know what there is, but there's some kind of
difference I can hear everyone do.
Oh, wait, can I hear everyone do a fake laugh?
Good old good and bad.
So, so like, who goes first?
Left to right.
Mahler can be first.
That's like right to left.
OK, fine. I mean, for people watching, oh, yeah, I guess it's different for everyone.
Yeah, fine. I'll go.
So like it says good and bad.
So like a good fake laugh is a bad.
What would that mean? Like believable?
Yeah, the best fake laugh you can do and like a clearly fake laugh.
So the clearly fake won't be like.
Almost sarcastic.
It's like straddling the line, you know, like,
then a fake laugh that I can you can generate without actually laughing and be
like, you like, hopefully no one actually paid attention to that because I didn't
read that sort of that sort of I would have done the exact same thing that you
just did. Yeah, just like.
Yeah.
Yeah. Anyone else want to do that takes.
Next up is Daspo shit.
Oh, OK.
So the fake laugh, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, that was pretty bad, right?
You get a lot of breath.
That's something I noticed, too.
I'm not trying to stall, but I noticed a lot of actors have trouble with laughing
and coughing. It's like none of them, like so few of them can get it right.
All right. So let me try to.
Do the do something real here.
All right. There you go.
I mean, the goal with the good fake laugh is probably to make us all go.
Was that real?
Was that fake? Yeah, like that's the sort of yeah.
And you'd think that with Mahler and myself,
especially, you'd have plenty of laugh, laugh ins.
But I'm next up on the list for my fake laugh.
We could do a ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, like Titus from Final Fantasy 10.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
And then I guess for a real laugh, let me see.
Sorry, let me take some more beer.
We're taking it.
The right at the butt, the beer in a beer.
And it goes in faster.
Yeah, and it gets into the blood system quicker.
Is that how that's how it works?
All right, let me see. I guess I was going to real laugh.
And see, I think that we're nailing it because all these last
and do like the eyes, we like sort of squint and you're like, was that you?
You fuck with me right now.
Well, yeah, that's the thing with when you can see people laugh,
you can like a real laugh, your eyes squint together and your cheeks curl up.
And, you know, you know, but but when it's just sound, it's a lot easier
to hide when it's sound, sound only, audio only.
That leaves metal belch.
I mean, I already did the tightest one.
It's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, you have a negative.
It's a really bad one. You'd actually do that.
Oh, no, that was that's your real laugh before.
So he goes, yeah.
It's like, so I don't want to like.
You know what we should do?
You finish up your thing and then I have a suggestion for us.
I mean, OK.
Do you? Yeah, he's done.
Yeah.
All right.
We need to do all of us at the same time doing it.
Why? So we're like,
this is like ending that together now, because I can't remember what I did.
Well, it'll be fine if they want to have all of us.
So all of us could do the fake laugh and then we could do the real laugh.
So that way, but they're all fake.
We're closing a sitcom, baby.
Well, one sounds
they have to be on people would want to use the audio.
Yeah, fine. If you don't want to fucking laugh, it's fine.
Just say, you know what?
I think I'm laughed enough today, rags.
I think I think we've been laughing enough today.
Enough chuckles for the evening.
I like the idea.
Yeah, it's pretty fucking amazing idea.
But, you know, I guess we're not doing it.
And now we can't do it for real because I'm so upset that I can't laugh for real.
So now what now what metal?
You did this.
You want to hear me cry for real?
Yeah.
Wait, look what you did.
Look what you did to dad.
Why me?
Why you? Yeah.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
I'm I'm I'm temple nudging myself right now.
Temple nudging.
Yes.
What?
I don't know what I've not been to that country.
Wait, what?
I don't know what's happening anymore.
I'm going to continue.
Yeah, but just just just move.
Latest RTS leak.
Ray summons force ghost of Mike Pence to cure Kylo of the gay.
If you could send Karl back, would it be for JJ or Ryan?
Also, hi, rags.
Hello.
So like, so like a terminator to get JJ or Ryan.
Let me convert that question into
what would you rather stop JJ's influence?
Star Wars or Riots?
Ryan's say Ryan's probably right.
What would poorly written versions of yourselves be like?
I just hypocritical like versions of ourselves be like, I guess, just like us,
but poorly written, I don't even really.
Under that's an that's an unusual question.
We end up in some kind of fictional thing.
And
I don't know, didn't care for accuracy in lots of different scenarios and
did some kind of interstellar like thing where we talk about how love will save us.
Love will carry us through the force that goes beyond life.
We would we would be a podcast that talks
about the movie's themes and the messages and we'd be very lefty politically and
that we wouldn't be able to tell like any of these jokes because there'd be some
erasure you'll never know when we'll actually like a film like a film comes out.
You watch it and you'd be like, oh, yeah, these guys will either not like it.
You'll just watch our podcast like, did they?
No, no, OK, they didn't because we can talk about a movie.
Also, our podcast would be like 40 minutes most next
because we'd just be so tired and exhausted and depressed.
We'd have to it would be 40 minutes with a 20 minute ad for Skillshare.
Or Raid Shadow Warrior or whatever the Raid Shadow Legends.
Yeah.
From the makers of Darkness Faps comes
the sequel to Halloween Skeleton Claws, I think there's another video I just searched.
I am getting a result.
I will check that out.
Oh, it's got lots of
masses of the universe and I wonder if.
Well, yeah, that should be playable.
I think it's an old cartoon should be right.
Should be right.
But yeah, I'll put it on the roster.
I was spotted at Fearpocalypse.
I missed him, sadly.
Forpocalypse.
I don't know. I guess that's a con of some kind.
I don't know. I'm scared to Google it.
Well, I'm assuming it's a furry con, so just saying.
Do Thumb Wars for eFap movies.
It's so stupid.
I mean, it's not the first time we've been put on the maybe pile, I guess.
Throw it on the maybe pile.
Hello, fellow Brewsters.
I've been listening as I reset my iPhone
after forgetting my passcode and losing one point two billion data.
Least I got you guys right now.
Oh, happy to be here.
Good night to them all going to blow, going to go blow ranch to Katana,
to Katara from Last Day of Bender.
Don't waste your money on Zombieland to just sale the seven C's if you're curious
to see it. Oh, yes.
High by Raggle, the Zizmizmiz.
Hello, goodbye.
Molar, I think you have a streaming addiction.
Oh, we took a we took a two week break.
And then people are like, oh, two streams.
Oh, well, I guess it was three.
If you do that, yeah, OK, fine.
You went high rags.
Hey, please assert your dominance over
my giant porg over and over and over and over.
Wipes drool off keyboard.
Oh, OK.
I don't know if I can.
Can we all agree that Battle Angel was objectively good?
I know that Fringy and Wolf will have
wids with the person who says that, I'm afraid.
I'm afraid I never saw it.
Still never saw it.
I did see it, but I've already mostly forgotten it.
I didn't really enjoy that much.
Imagine Trump saying we need to build a roof.
Yeah, yeah.
Swat cats equals rag wolfs.
Also, E.R. again when.
Swat cats equals rag wolfs.
I wasn't SWAT cats like a cartoon or something.
It was back in the 90s.
Oh, that's one of the videos that was going to get played.
But we decided against it because it's got the things in it.
OK, I followed.
Also, E.R. again when we'll probably have back at some point.
We'll see. I know you said you'd be up for it.
We just got to find the right topics and stuff.
Yeah, we just got to find something he's really familiar with.
Water the plant that is E.R.
And water the plant.
I guess Spooder Wars is canceled.
I thankful that you all enjoyed this saga of spiders.
Thank you all very much.
Yeah, I don't know why they
decided to shit on that one specifically, but YouTube is changing its tisms, I guess.
So wait a minute, huh?
You know, well, we've watched Spider Wars for ages or Spooder Wars.
And for some reason, this is the first one where it was like, all right.
I guess it was the music in the background.
I don't know.
Oh, the meme.
OK, I was about to say, like, it sounded like he was saying Spider-Man into the
Spider-Verse 2 was canceled or something, and I got one.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm sure that's good.
Also, there's only four left.
And then we'll probably read that tweet if you want to raise because that sounds
interesting. Mm hmm.
Everybody at the same time, do DSPs laugh.
I don't know the latter.
I don't know what that laugh is.
I do.
You want to do it?
It's kind of been a while.
I don't remember it.
I sorry.
Tell metal about the book, Germany Must Parish.
Yeah, tell me about it.
All right.
I don't know much about it, but there's a book called Germany Must Parish.
Germany Must Parish.
It's waggot season.
I'm sorry.
Please go easy on me.
Oh, about the
a battle angel thing.
You're fine. You're fine.
Yes, you haven't seen it.
So Rags has just linked a tweet.
Let's see.
Star Wars 9, C3PO Anthony Daniels reveals his disappointment with the new films.
Daniel says, oh, wait, I'm not sure how I'm supposed to read this exactly.
The actor says, well, yes, I do understand why the fans are unhappy.
It speaks to a devotion that they care so much that they mind if someone messes
with it, I understand people being critical of the films.
He has remained fairly silent until now,
while stars like Mark Hamill have dropped loaded comments online and interviews.
Daniel says, I know it's been particularly
difficult for him in relation to Hamill lately because the new movies haven't
given him much to do.
I certainly recognize that and can relate to it.
In these new movies, I felt like a table decoration.
That is difficult because I recognize this character.
C3PO is with so much more.
But I understand it is a whole film, not a feature about C3PO.
That is just my personal disappointment.
I get paid whether or not he does anything.
It would be nice for him to have a purpose.
Oh, bad.
And then there's links for all takes from people.
Shitting on him basically in response, I think.
Lots of people saying, I hope he dies.
The character, I mean, C3PO.
Oh, OK, Jesus.
Got one saying, when was C3PO more than a talking prop?
C3PO was a full on character.
Yeah, well, he's not really in the sequel trilogy.
Like, I'm trying to remember.
He's just he just spouts off a random singular line per every like half a film.
Jeb Nichols has responded saying, excuse my two cents,
but if old actors can't play ball about not being the main character,
they should leave the ball and go home.
Yeah, always a good thing to say.
Jeb.
Run faster, dude, and it's slowing down.
Can't wait for Ben to kill that golden boomer.
Wow.
Fucking hell.
Wow. What he said wasn't even controversial.
Like, yes.
Let's go back to ignoring the O.T.
cast and shitty men.
Y'all, please bring peace back to my timeline.
OK, I bet that's exactly what they're going to do.
They're going to frickin kill him, too.
They've killed every other original character at this point.
Just fuck all the old things.
The new things are way better.
You guys like the new stuff better, right?
So what the hell with that old shit?
So it was retweeted a gun pointed at old white men.
OK.
All right, yeah, that happened.
Sorry, see three.
Pio.
Feels Boardman talk about it.
It comes from the crowd.
It's like everyone's a loud opinion.
Apparently.
But, yeah, that about brings us to the end.
This was the meme stream.
Yeah, there were a couple of memes that didn't make it.
We got suspended twice.
I don't know exactly what that means.
Yeah, the stream from yesterday will be up on Moolah very soon.
We got more Batwoman coming very soon.
This stream, there's a good chance you're not going to see it for a while.
I don't know what's going to happen when I try to re-upload this thing.
It's going to be processes we shall see.
It's going to be interesting.
Yeah, thank you all for for coming.
Thank you all for the incredible community content.
I'm going to try and get it all onto the Discord.
I'll link those videos in the re-upload.
Thank you all for the donations and for for watching as well.
There's three more.
Let me just read these.
Ah, that's DFP.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's how he did it.
That's how he left.
If anyone makes memes for IFAB, please look up the Japanese ads for Longman's
Sekiru gum. There's gold in them there, Hills.
And then seriously, what's wrong with people?
Oh, you know, that's when we're at the usual.
Thank you all and good night.
Good night. Good night.
Good night, Tisms.
