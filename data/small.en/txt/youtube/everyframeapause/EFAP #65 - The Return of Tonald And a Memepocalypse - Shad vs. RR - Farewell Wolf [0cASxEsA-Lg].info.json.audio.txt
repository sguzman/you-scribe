It's telling me whether or not the broadcast is working, uh, during people in chat saying things.
It's like, I'm gonna assume it's working at that point. Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?
Who knows what shenanigans YouTube will play? Exactly.
All right, now I've just gotta find the relevant video and then snatch a chat link from it because
it doesn't provide me them anymore. What? Yep. Like, I gotta go to the individual video and get
chat from there instead of having it beforehand. Not annoying at all. Nope. People are saying late
man bad. I did what I could. You know, 30 minutes isn't a lot to do all of the tisms. You can do
some tisms, I agree. But what if it was? Uh, that's a will I don't want to be a part of. I'm sorry.
I don't know how I feel about that. Well, how do you feel about a will that doesn't have feelings?
I'm sorry, what? I don't know how much I can feel about a world that doesn't have feelings.
Well, or it doesn't have rules. What if you're talking about how you feel about this will before
entering it so you would still have the feelings? I had a feeling once. How'd it go?
Oh, that's kind of shit. That's why I swore off feelings. And then I took a vow that nobody else
could feel things or have opinions. It went well. All right, everything should be fine.
I'm getting faster at correcting all YouTube's speed bumps.
That's the previous ones unlisted. This one's the only one that's around.
And we're live. Thumbnail's correct. Chat is working. Everything, literally every last thing
is perfect. We did it. Excellent. All right. So if you're all still in the watch together,
we were we were about to carry on with watching a bit of Tonal Bloke.
He has graced us with a return. He disappeared for a bit, had himself a break. And that's fine.
We all have breaks, you know, but ultimately, Tonal can't leave the internet forever. He is
the inspiration for hundreds, if not thousands, if not millions, millions, billions. We're going
all the way back to the reason EFAP was created. Exactly. TLJ and Tonal. Those are the two things
that made in heaven. So yeah, you guys ready to watch some Tonal? I'm very ready. I was born ready.
Exciting stuff. Here we go. And naked. Oh my.
After EA's less than stellar treatment of the Star Wars franchise lately, I had more or less
expected Fallen Order to land somewhere in the ballpark of painfully average to a bucket of
deep fried crap. For me, Star Wars has actually been going downhill for years. Jar Jar Binks,
the laughably fake CGI, midichlorians, hem, and culminating with the unholy apocalypse that is
the last Jedi. Man's got some opinions. Man's got some opinions. TLJ's the unholy apocalypse,
fellas. Well, yeah, if we'll have Tonal understood themes and characters, then...
I can't believe that Tonal actually has the cognitive functionality to be able to say that
TLJ is bad, but the last guy that we just watched can't come to that same conclusion.
Oh, it's Tonal's fault. How much? How smart do you have to be? I severely underestimated how
intelligent Tonal actually is. You gotta remember, the guy in the other video said you gotta be smart
to be able to have seen this stuff, right? Tonal is smart. So I'm not like he bases his
smartness as a quality. He is what it is to be smart. He is. Yeah, he's smartness.
You gotta be smart to understand TLJ is what the guy's point was, right? You gotta,
he said something like you gotta pay attention and you gotta like all these different things. So,
you know, Tonal is just like us. He just, you cognitively failed TLJ to come to this conclusion,
but that's fine with me. Oh my. We're in this group. We'll stick together with Tonal leading
us through the darkness. Good Star Wars and bad. And on the gaming side, EA has more or less
condemned Star Wars as well to a life of mediocrity with the failed MMO, the mass market
cash cow battlefronts, and the kitty games on mobile. Next on the chopping block is Fallen
Order. And to my surprise, and thankfully EA finally did what any sane publisher would do with
the competent. He's like the way he speaks to my surprise. And thankfully the prize and thankfully
EA finally did what any sane publisher would do with a competent developer partner. Stay out of
their way. Fallen Order is the first piece of Star Wars media I've consumed in 10 years that
I've been fully satisfied with, with the exception of Rogue One on film. In a year, at least mildly
replete with good games, it stands atop most of them actually with fantastic art design, a well
paced and fun story. What does replete mean? I don't know. I'm about to take a little look-see.
Tonal's using words, or well supplied with something. So, mildly supplied with good games.
All right, Tonal. You guys, you know, you meme about how, oh, it doesn't make sense, some words
he uses. Well, sometimes he teaches us shit, okay? I was just being certain. I didn't know if
replete meant like it had to be like full. So it was like a way of saying half full.
Someone in the chat asked what MMO he was referencing. I think he was talking about
The Old Republic. Although that wasn't an EA game. He might have fucked up and said it was,
but it still did fail as far as I'm aware. You failed. To them actually with fantastic
art design, a well paced and fun story, and solid game mechanics. If you want to be a nitpicky,
you can definitely find some flaws. The game's cosmetic system. 21 different ponchos. I mean,
come on. Some issues with the camera and hitboxes. Not enough bosses. Nor complex boss mechanics.
A few bugs and glitches. And of course, the game's... I wouldn't say the bosses, just the bosses
fucking suck. And a full on game review here. This is weird because the video is called Woke
Star Wars. I'm not 100% clear on what he's referencing yet, but I'm excited. I guess we'll
find out. Lead up to the finale. However, they nailed the rest of it. Fallen Order is an extremely
fun action adventure game that you can pick up and beat in 15 hours without the need to repeat it as
an all inclusive package. Under the heavy hand of modern corporate and game design, that might
not be a worthy proposition for a gamer who wants an all-you-can-eat buffet in every single game he
or she owns. However, for those who like our game experiences concise and punchy, Fallen Order fits
the bill nicely. In replace of arbitrary bitch work, grinding, checklists, or fluff, you instead
have a linear set path with one quest to complete to arrive at the end of the game. Cal's Adventure
is the classic race. Can you pause it? We're almost two minutes into this video and I'm like
not able to pick it apart. Yeah, he's so far pretty sound. It's like actually kind of solid.
Makes sense so far. I disagree with a couple of his takes, but not like huge disagreements.
Yeah. Wow. This is bizarre. He's coming a long way. He did it.
The sacred item against an evil bad dude, or chick in this case, that wants to kill you and rule the
galaxy. At no point in the journey does the game ever move backwards or sideways and the conflict
always jumps forward from point A to point B in a very timely manner. Character threads are mostly
fleshed out, Cal's character arc feels natural, and the motives make sense. This is a game that
plays like a video game but acts like a movie. Introduction and setup, sudden conflict, rising
action, defeatism, struggle, and defeatism. I don't even know if you could refer to it that way.
Could that... Well, defeatism. Let's have a look.
Apparently it exists. The acceptance of defeat without struggle.
I don't know if that's applicable because I haven't played the campaign yet.
I don't think it's quite applicable. I'd say defeat is, but I think he's just trying to make
it sound a little better, but it's not tonal. Rising action, defeatism, struggle, and resolution.
All in 15 hours of straight to the point, no BS gameplay. Gotta admit, this is a pretty goddamn
nice breath fresh air, and to be assumed mostly independence of EA's influence. Pretty nice breath
fresh air. Did he don't even skip the all? This is a pretty goddamn nice breath fresh air, and to be
assumed mostly independence... Rewind that and slow hold it. Okay. I don't have to gedelb that shit too.
Gedelb. Gedurlb. Gedurb. Yes, gameplay. Gotta admit, this is a pretty goddamn nice breath
fresh air, and to be assumed mostly independence of EA's influence as a publisher.
Influence. Somebody else said this, didn't they? I could have sworn.
Influence. Influence.
Influence. It's influence. Accenting the wrong syllable. Pretty nice breath fresh air.
It's a level.
Traditionally, they've toyed with developers like puppets, prodding them with a barbed whip
at every corner, condemning them to create games in a vacuum of what's best for the bottom line.
Here, free from subjugation, Respawn was able to make the game they wanted to make without
all the BS that comes with the madness of modern gaming propaganda. Holy shit.
That's a classic toy. Can we just rewind that again?
Without all the BS that comes with the madness of modern gaming propaganda,
holy shit. A game developer sets out, makes a game they want to, and it's good. Shocking.
Overall, the game is small in scale, but it packs a punch. Trilla as the villain
is completely badass, not to mention hot ass.
That just makes it sound like he's saying his literal
name. She's pissed, and her hateful presence enfoils the tale nicely in a sense of urgency,
which makes Cal's mission feel pressing, which led me to want to keep playing and see where it was
going. Boss battles could have done with a little bit more mechanical depth though.
Not only is there not enough fights in my opinion, but the showdowns here
feel slightly run in the mill. Run in the mill. I actually agree with the sentiment though,
I haven't really disagreed with too much of this video. Lies, obviously lies.
If you've played a Souls game, get ready to feel right at home. Roll out of the way of the overhead
attack, block the three hit swiping combo, dodge the unlockable, dodge the three hit swiping combo
I think. Yeah, you made sense. Souls game, get ready to feel right at home. Roll out of the way
of the overhead attack, block the three hit swiping combo, dodge the unlockable, punish.
If not for the awesome spectacle of fighting in a rainstorm or atop a thousand foot tree in the
movie of Avatar, the bosses would otherwise have been just go. Yeah, I guess he's saying it looks
kind of like Pandora, I guess. I will say it looks more like Pandora than it looks like Kashyyyk.
It's like a really fucking overly generic forest level. Doesn't really scream Star Wars at all,
which is weird because you'd think Kashyyyk would be really easy to make look like Kashyyyk is
supposed to look, I guess. Just looks like a really boring forest for the most part.
It's okay. Still fun though. That's because combat is fun in fallen order across. It's still fun though,
and that's because all those combat is fun. Who could argue with that? Cow's lightsaber feels
weighty yet fluid, which sinks up nicely. I said weighty yet fluid, I think.
It was numerous options for character movement and environmental manipulation, dodge, roll,
parry, force powers, and healing. Unlike the obvious influence of Dark Souls, the need to
constantly roll around like a damn chimpanzee is not necessary. Cow can pull enemies to him,
push him away, slow down time. You know, the only issue I'm having here is
all understand the title. Yeah, I don't understand the title, but this is unironically one of the
best videos we've covered on efap. Yeah, it's so weird. Like remember when he was showing those
clips from like movies and shit? They actually like made sense in the context with what he was
saying, whereas usually that doesn't happen. Man, what can we say? Yeah. Did he actually make a good
video? Dodge, parry, whatever he wants, as previously mentioned, as a result, combat has this
warm flowy feel to it. That ends up being one of the games warm flowy. I didn't get that warm creamy
feel. I didn't. I don't really like the combat in the game. I mean, he's clearly in love. I don't
really mind the combat. I have issues with the enemy design and the enemy placement.
And I cannot get over the fact that the scout troopers are the melee ones. It doesn't make
sense. That is a little odd. One wouldn't expect that. That's for sure. Strongest areas. The other
area that was really well done was the level design and platforming. Taking some influence
from uncharted and Tomb Raider, Fallen Order is filled to the brim with simple platforming
challenges and puzzles that connect map routes together. These platforming elements come in a
form of sliding, jumping, roping, wall running, and climbing. Certain elements require special
items, which limit Cal's exploration capabilities initially, yet he can come back to them later
once acquiring the tools. It's a recipe that calls for a heavy dash of dark souls.
A glug of Prince of Persia. What does that mean? It's a glug. It's more than a sip.
Okay, I understand him perfectly. It was a dish of a Sunday brunch should be the humble fruit salad.
Normally, we don't get many hodgepodge titles because it's difficult to find the right symmetry
among different game ideas. For the amateur developer achieving equally, I was enjoying so
much, but if you wish, Librium is a disaster waiting to happen. For Fallen Order, there are
so many avenues for potential peppery that it boggles the mind. What was that? I guess we had
a slow note. Potential fuckery was it? Okay, back to slow note. Giving equilibrium is a disaster
waiting to happen. For Fallen Order, there are so many avenues for potential peppery that it boggles
potential peppery. That's what it sounds like. Poppery? I'm pretty sure he meant to say fuckery
and he's blocked it out. It just sounds like fucking poppery. I don't know. The news for potential
peppery that it boggles the mind in this regard. Too much combat, too many climbing sections,
fiddly controls, annoying levels that wrap around way too much, yada yada yada, I can go on for days.
Simply throwing everything into a witch's cauldron and praying it turns out. What a strange
reference, but alright. As opposed to another cauldron, but alright. You can get wizard cauldrons,
they're very different operating on this. You like to have the cauldron of a wizard?
On way too much. Yada yada yada, I can go on for days. Simply throwing everything into a witch's
cauldron and praying it turns out greats is not going to get the job done in most cases, let alone
make a fantastic game. It takes a deft hand to create balance and tie those elements together,
and they achieve that with Fallen Order. If they want to build upon this game and make another,
surely giving the player control of the starship would be the first order of business.
Fallen Order provides no space exploration or combat, no stealth, no player choice in the story,
and no role-playing elements outside the skill tree, which is limiting in itself. Perhaps these
are the things that they could consider for their next iteration, although I'd be perfectly fine if
they didn't. That's because this game is good on its own and you can't find many games like Fallen
Order. It's both a high quality linear action game and an amalgamation of not just some of the best
industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing and mixed in the proper proportions.
It was really bad about it in the past where it would just be him cycling through a menu and then
randomly cut to him walking down a hall. He is improved. Like, I don't know what else to say,
like this is, you know, we're near the end. Wow. It's like he watched us and actually took
the criticism to heart. Yeah. Tonal, this is unironically a pretty good video. I don't agree
with everything he said, but this is genuinely good. This is up there, man. Not bad. And an
amalgamation of not just some of the best industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing and mixed
in the proper proportions. You see that sentence? It's very confusing. Properly. Yeah. It's an
excellent game with mixed, you know, it's an odd with mixed in proper proportion of the game and
an amalgamation of not just some of the best industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing
and mixed in the proper proportions. A feat surely much harder than it sounds.
Fallen Order is not original. It's not innovative. It's a consolidation of industry standard game
design with the amazing visual world of Star Wars and Respawn's well-known wall running mechanic.
Nothing more and nothing less. Sounds about right. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty much 100% accurate.
If you've ever tried to whip up a fancy recipe for dinner, the easiest part is to go to the
store and buy the ingredients. The hard part is bringing them together correctly so that the dish
is harmonious in the end. Fallen Order takes components and creates symmetry. It's not a
perfect game, but it's as good as any game I've played this year. And it doesn't try to be
anything it isn't while doing it. It's not ashamed of what it is or where those ideas came from.
It is a game that woke Star Wars from the brink of death on the gaming front and
oh, this. Oh, oh, he used Woken. Correct. Woken Woken. Yeah.
Oh, that's definitely not what I. Yeah, I wouldn't title the star video that way.
Not when the connotation with Woken Star Wars is pretty obvious.
I mean, the title doesn't make any sense. And I understand what he was going for,
but it really shouldn't. He shouldn't have titled it that way. But otherwise,
this is pretty strong video. Yeah, the amount of time he spends. I'm blown away.
The developers at Respawn should be extremely proud of the game they created.
It proves that whoever is funding the creation of anything Star Wars really needs to separate
themselves from the actual creation. This will probably reduce the chance that games or movies
get made with a hard on for the bottom line and nothing else. The highest quality products are
produced when a hands-off policy is promoted between teams, which gave me more power to.
No, I agree. He didn't use the fart sound. No, he didn't use the he said
or something like that. Like he cut himself out almost.
Like five minutes. Why didn't he just do that? I missed the phone.
I need the phone to know that this is this is this is an adult.
How am I supposed to know that it's a potty word? Mm hmm.
No, a thing or two about making a good game or movie to make something people actually want.
Maybe we can take this lesson learned and carry it through to build a brighter future of Star Wars
media. Oh my God. Oh, what can we say? If that began to shit on tonal a year later,
he's actually put out a good video. Oh, my God. What the fuck?
Well, our child, I'm so proud of you. Our boys grown up. Mm hmm.
He's become like genuine man. Make more of this. I would actually subscribe to you unironically.
Oh, my God. He's become everything and more. You think it's like loads of time.
Well, do you think that he's just really passionate about this game and so
thus passionate about the video? Maybe maybe that might be the case.
Someone in the chat said that maybe tonal is so apolitical.
He doesn't actually know what wokeness is. Oh, God, you might be correct.
Look at those claps in chat. Look at that. Very good tonal.
Congratulations. We're proud of you.
Everyone go give this video a like and like say we want more of this.
Yeah, it's a pretty good review. That was that was good. Take it home, buddy.
Tonal, you just offered us the best video we've ever watched in the history of eFap.
That might actually be true. It might actually. I'd have to look.
This is the day the Lord has made. Oh, wow.
That brings us into the nicely into video memes, ones that are free from copyright.
And here we used to think that tonals would be like a video meme, but it wasn't.
It was. It was insane.
It was a real. He's redeemed himself.
Yeah, so there's there's a lot of video memes that are copyright minefields,
and I have kept them all into this big folder. We are going to record something offline,
looking at them, and then I will re-upload that as a eFap mini,
just like, you know, meme mini or whatever, after I fiddle with it in Vegas to get it
copyright friendly. Give me a lot of things I'll just do to it. So if your preferred video
doesn't show up, don't panic. It's just because it's probably copyrightisms.
Even everyone's clapping and someone sent in a super chat saying that he didn't even ask for
the claps. That's how you know he's done something right. He didn't he didn't pull a jab on us.
So, wow.
So many to choose.
Guess we could start with back on the meme stream, we covered a guy called
Capital Opinions. Do you remember that man? He he made the NPC review.
Uh, yeah.
So he's got a video called film criticism when everything is subjective.
But we've checked this out. Yeah, let's take a look.
Hello, friend. Hello. What did you think of the new Joker film? I really liked it.
What did you think of it? I really disliked it.
I respect your opinion. I respect your opinion.
That's pretty funny.
I love the pause. Yeah, like they don't know what happens next.
So we watched NPC reviews one. He has NPC reviews number two.
Oh, my goodness. This is called that film you like is actually dangerous. And here's why.
Oh, my goodness. So quick disclaimer. Remember, this is just my opinion and you're not allowed
to criticize me. Okay.
I didn't want to have to make this video, but someone has to put everyone in their place.
And I guess it's gonna have to be me.
You know the one. I'm not going to mention it by name because I don't want to give such a dangerous
film free publicity, but this movie might just be the most socially irresponsible piece of media
to be released for this year. And this current social and political climate with far right
extremism on the rise with a literal white supremacist in the White House with incels
and gamers going around shooting people and saying things I disagree with on the internet.
The fact that they made a movie that humanizes a white male protagonist is absolutely appalling.
Not only that, the movie actually tries to get audiences to sympathize with an incel
loner who commits acts of far right terrorism. Now, I haven't actually seen the movie because I don't
want to subject. But nonetheless, I think it's important to talk about. Now, some idiots have
actually fallen for the idea put forth by the main character himself that this movie and this
main character aren't political. Yeah, right, as if it's even possible to be apolitical. You see,
this movie is just one of many movies released in recent years that tries to trick audiences by
claiming to be apolitical. But in reality, it just supports the status quo. Like Paddington 2.
The colonial experience. This movie even has the audacity to have the veneer of leftist class
politics over it to make you think the movie has something meaningful and deep to say. Spoiler alert,
it doesn't. Speaking of the supposedly apolitical nature of the movie, the director of this film
has been going around saying this movie is a response to the woke crowd and the mythical
cancel culture we're allegedly living in. Which should tell you everything you need to know,
really. Well, no one thinks my offensive jokes are funny. Well, if you can't think of jokes that don't
cause literal pain and violence towards marginalized people, then maybe you should study
quantum mechanics, build a time machine, and go back to Nazi Germany where you belong. Anyway,
all the great lengths this film goes through to portray the cisgendered straight white male
protagonist as a victim. The real victims of this movie are the actresses of color that the film
uses like props. Side note, if I were to suggest a rewrite to help fix this movie, I would make
Sassy Beats the main character instead of Joaquin Phoenix. And instead of being a single mom, she'd
be a badass crime fighter. And instead of it being anything like it currently is, it'd make it
completely different. It's a small change, but it would make it all different. It's a small change.
Ah, but alas, that's not the movie we got. What we did get is a movie that clearly hates women.
And what's most frightening is all the ignorant and easily manipulatable audience members who
won't see the racist and misogynistic themes of this movie and will internalize the ideology
without any critical thought. Thankfully, I'm here to save you all for yourselves and help you save
the correct thoughts and see the world properly. You're welcome. And as if all that wasn't bad
enough, the film is just a blatant derivative ripoff of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver,
which is a much better film. Wait a minute. If the movie is problematic and it's a ripoff,
maybe it's because Taxi Driver has deep themes and this movie is shallow and thinks it's smarter
than it is. Yeah, yeah, that's it. This movie isn't nearly as smart as it thinks it is. And
it has absolutely nothing deep to say about anything. All in all, this movie is just bad.
It's dangerous and irresponsible to make a movie like this on current year. And I think there's
still a very high likelihood that this movie will be directly responsible for violence.
In fact, I'm really hoping it will be because I would really validate my worldview. Anyway,
that's all I have for you today. Thanks for watching. If you like this video, don't forget
to like, subscribe, ring the bell and give me all your money. If you take anything away from this
video, let it be this. The next time you think about going to see a film directed by, written by,
or starring a white guy, just go support the films of marginalized filmmakers instead.
Anyway, thanks for watching everyone. And always remember,
everything is objectively subjective so you're not allowed to criticize me.
Pretty great content, huh? That's good. I like that.
Capital Opinions. Yeah, I was gonna say. I like it.
We'll post his channel in the chat in a moment. But yes, Capital Opinions, you can find him.
He's made two of those now. We covered him last time on the meme stream that we did.
Hopefully, this one doesn't go down with copyright at some point. So that it will be
delayed as hell before we actually get to promote him again. But buddy stuff. I have a feeling that
he's aware of the podcast. We like your videos. They amuse us. They are very good. I think they
are fantastic. You did a good job. So many great quotes. Most of them are real. So it just makes
it that much better. I like how blood the video is. If everything is subjective,
this is how a movie conversation goes. Yep, pretty much.
All right, so I've set this one. I'm not 100% sure of what I'm dealing with.
Oh, boy. Neither do we. So don't worry. A mod of some kind.
That's the big, true, true.
Fuck you, Derek.
That's it? Like, I don't have any more for that.
Can you replay that? Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Is that a pizza wall?
Oh, fuck you, Derek.
Got to be a woman.
Yeah, I know. That's it. I don't know.
Who's Derek? What's the what's the context behind that?
Right. Who's Derek?
Oh, I forget. Oh, my goodness.
I forget about all all that such vitriol.
I know. I must have really hated. He must have really been a piece of shit.
In fairness, he's Derek. Yeah.
Typical. This is typical. Fucking Derek.
All right. Ready for the next one?
I'm very ready for the next one.
I love this one. Fads of Baguettias.
The Freudian and pupil Baguettias are the first in history to engage in debate on the trap questions.
Dearest pupil, I beseech thee to abandon these explorations unto massively.
The gods erected boykind to please girlkind, not thine tireless phallus.
Considered this honored mentor.
If it were a lad of most effete beauty and the room were dark,
would it truly be queenly to mount him in ignorance?
Imagine, if you will, the shadow of a youth cast on a wall in silhouette.
They're growing as yet obscure.
As stimulating as I find such theoretical, the ancient wisdom remains unchanged.
If the balls do not come in contact, as a man partaken in the big gay.
But my master, are you not in an effable champion of the subjective naturity of existence?
If all about us is but a mirage of our senses, then surely the big gay too is up to interpretation.
A world of our senses is surely subjective. Never doubt that, fair Baguettias.
But within the framework of what our eyes and pains do tell us,
your summertime fling had a manhood beneath her stola.
You ought to confess to your wife, O Pupil.
Leave big titties out of this.
It's actually too wonderfully written.
That was great.
Yeah, there's two big videos of that exchange.
We'll have to.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, that was a good one.
That was great.
Whoever wrote that.
Hard to keep the names together.
But that was that was one I'll remember.
That was quite a quick, funny one.
There was a good comment in the chat.
Brooks isn't a debater.
And that's what I've always said.
I've never said I was a debater.
I don't do debates.
I don't even do very many live streams on my channel.
I just do this for fun.
And yeah, if I'm a bad debater, so be it.
I don't give a shit.
Debates are gay.
Debates are gay.
I love the visual representation of debates
and him breaking his own neck.
Yeah, mauler debates are gay.
Debates are gay, yo.
All right.
Such a sweet, such a sweet lad.
This one's pretty legendary.
How many medias are there now?
Too many?
Yes.
One is too many.
That turned out pretty well.
But it's also less than a month.
Should we do a Medea movie for our little side project?
Yeah, boy.
Oh, yeah, we could do it.
Marvel is released.
Medea gets an abortion.
It doesn't seem like great schedule.
It could be.
I don't fucking know.
I've never watched one of those.
You have to ask, which is that?
Well, well, that's a thing is like...
Medea goes to Wakanda.
That wouldn't be a far-fetched conclusion.
Medea joins the KKK.
Medea joins Thanos.
Medea.
Medea invades Iraq.
Oh, it's the passion of the Medea.
Safe private Medea.

I still can't get over these Medea names.
Medea battle angel.
Black Medea down.
Clockwork Medea.
Medea's Bizarre Adventure.
Guardians of the Medea.
3 tend of Medea.
The Dark Medea Rises.
Medea Skull Island.
Grand Theft of Medea.

What would it wouldn't?
What would Promatheus do?
Promedea.
Surprisingly.
Promedea Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
That's so much better.
It's picturing like the dude's body with like her head,
but like still muscular blue.
But she's like, you know how Han Solo says that Indiana Jones
is like a well of content.
There's so much you can do with the character.
There is nothing that compares to Medea.
You can put Medea in anything.
And it will be just as terrible as the last one.
Yeah, they put a lot of effort to make it.
It's like going to visualize the Medea films is important.
I love that Billy the fridge was just sitting there silently.
You don't get it.
You don't get it.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sexual arrest.
Okay.
Sexual arrestemento.
This is good, right?
In Maller's video, Captain Marvel and Unburdled Man,
at Timecode 2014, we see a clip of Jeff Bush.
Now I know what you're thinking.
What did you bring me?
But wait, came out on April 18th, 2019.
And the f-app stream that manufactured the Jeb Bush meme
was on November 3rd, 2019.
That's exactly 200 days apart.
Why is this?
Is Mahler a plant from the Illuminati and or the Bush family
to help set up the new world order was
I love that frigging was really really move sugar with his mind.
Who can we ask that would know the pig from the Walmart commercial?
That thing's thick.
Hey, he's just dropping his money everywhere.
No, big idiot.
Well, that's all the time I have for this video.
High raggers and long man mother.
Hello.
Hey!
Good, uh, good conspiracy theory.
Not gonna confirm or deny.
So, um, this, uh, I'm not even gonna tell you
why this was created specifically.
I hope you'll just know.
Oh, is it another one?
It's a short way.
No.
Jay, what do you want?
I'll get, give me some.
Okay.
What?
Oh, god.
That's fucking horrible.
It's the droid to kill movie ball.
It's horrifying.
That's disturbing.
Why though?
Oh my god, you can make memes.
That doesn't mean you should.
No.
Oh, what a terrifying creature.
I thought that was like a chicken or earth.
Turkey, like rolling down the hall and then it unfolds.
It was terrifying.
I agree.
That really is terrifying.
Oh my goodness.
Gotta love that we did the force sprint thing too.
The force super speed and we were talking about that earlier.
It all comes up.
Oh my god.
Remember that tune, Frank's?
Oh my goodness.
Oh, black men.
What was the context of that?
That is a Batwoman episode.
Batwoman.
They're all terrible.
So it's kind of hard to be like, oh, it's a bad one.
But yeah, this is the bad Batwoman episode.
Not the good one.
This is the bad one.
Oh my god.
I can't say I have.
No, I haven't.
That's a no with me.
What does it mean?
That's true, a big.
Oh, it's Twitter, Galaxy.
being.
That's J. W.
Yeah, when we tried to warn us, who do you think it was?
Like, I was Twitter deleted.
I didn't know J had that kind of power.
That was pretty good.
Isn't it?
I hope it was funny.
I mean, I think I think there's some validity there.
I don't know.
I can't disprove it.
So it must be true.
The fucking tooth.
I I was expecting it was going to be like, see, they have like similar facial structure
and that's like no teeth.
They do, though.
Clearly they do.
They don't.
Oh, my God.
I can't imagine, like, being a human and having this much hatred.
Oh, that's amazing.
That's a good name.
I'm a good rat right there.
All right.
More good rat on the way, you know?
That was some good.
I genuinely and ironically hope that Jar Jar is in it.
People say.
Yeah, man.
I would love Jar Jar to turn up.
It would make me so happy.
It would it would genuinely make me happy.
By the way, we are 14 seconds away from finishing this video.
They cannot mistreat Jar Jar either.
If like someone kills Jar Jar, I will be mad.
Yes, if they created Jar Jar defenders, if they create it, if they brought Jar Jar into
the narrative and had him die, I would be upset.
And ironically, you just brought him here to kill him.
Jar Jar deserves.
He was just he was just sitting somewhere, sitting in the area where like they get ready
to kill Jar Jar.
Like, this is what the fans want, right?
An old Jar Jar living off his pension from the Senate, just relaxing in retirement.
And then, you know, episode nine knocks on his door.
And just fucking cuts it down into shaking.
Milo violently made him as the representative of the move with a fucking sequel films.
He deserved better.
That's really funny.
Sad reality.
Oh, that's fun.
It's the second time we've seen a meme that covers something we talked about in the last
stream.
Yeah.
Oh, this one I meant to play at a different point, I guess, because it's like it's not
a meme video.
It's a video that's kind of like that NPC review thing, but it's also a good rant.
Jumping.
This is called Every Game Analysis Video Essay.
That's what this is called.
All right. Enjoy.
Jumping is a core part of video games from Super Mario to Super Mario three.
It allows the player to move upwards, forwards, upwards and forwards.
But what makes a jump feel good in new and exciting ways?
I'm Tom O'Regan.
This is Game Player's University.
And let's jump into it.
Oh, my God, it's perfect.
Mm hmm.
That sounds all right.
It's got all the amount of pretension that one of these videos could have.
It's a Bob Brown video, like through and through.
It's perfect.
The first game featured in the jump mechanic was 1988's Super Mario Bros 2, directed by
Kintsuki Tanabe.
And while it's easy to think of the Italian plumber as the grandfather of jumping, it's
actually a little more complicated.
You see, while it released in the US and Europe as Super Mario 2, the game is actually just
a reskin of the Japanese title, Mega Man X.
And so it's actually the blue bomber we have to thank for the gift of ascension.
But how does this jumping work and what new opportunities did it allow for?
Let's jump into it.
It goes to black again.
The mechanic works like this, the player that's you would press the B button to gain altitude
or pair that with the left or right buttons on the D pad or directional pad to perform
a lateral movement.
In retrospect, this might seem shockingly simple, but back in 1786, the game was like,
I never seen it.
I never didn't like it.
So how did this simple yet revolutionary new idea change the gaming landscape as we know
it?
Well, let's...
Shit that has nothing to do with anything.
Oh, fade the black into it.
Third fade.
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment
and especially on their children than the unlived life of the parent.
Now, you might be wondering what this has to do with jumping in a video game.
With jumping developers all over the world are putting their own unique spin on this
brave new mechanic.
Now you can jump off walls, jump on your half, sometimes even jump and then jump again.
What exciting new territory are these players in color?
Only time for the challenge.
Aim for the bushes.
Hey, thanks for watching.

I like to think he may have seen Godelb, no idea, but that was wonderful.
That was perfect.
I loved it.
That is from Tom O'Regan.
I will push him into the old stream chat in a moment, but I just love it.
I love these things because it's just like stripping away all of the pretentious garbage
that you get from those videos because they just see through it, people.
It's so crap.
They're just like, let's jump.
I learned so much about jumping from that video.
I didn't know it was jumping.
I feel like a jumping expert.
More parody.
Shit, it's fun.
Oh, video essayists.
What won't they do?
They make good content.
All right.
This is called, do plants sneeze?
Do plants sneeze?
Do you think?
Copyright claims.
We just says bullet.
Glad you're back.
Wolf played the last time I'll ever be on YouTube.
Well, at least you saw it.
Yeah.
Oh, this one may amuse.
Wolf racks the game of thrones.
Oh, my God.
And the fucking shitty thing is, is the last two episodes were really good.
Me and mala were so happy.
We were like, fuck.
It's good again.
It's really fucking good again.
And then this happened and we were so happy for most of the episode and then the end happened.
It's like, what the fuck did you do that for it to top it all off ice dragon with the blue
fire.
So it breathes the blue fire on the wall and blows the fucking thing up.
And then when John needs to hide behind a little fucking student, well, if you have
amazing insights, lots of Iron Man three, it's shit, but not a season eight episode
three.
Fuck that.
Damn it.
I hate this show.
You made me all invested.
We would get hit with copyright for that song, right?
Because that's all over the games.
Is that how that works?
Like let's please be hit with copyright, right?
They might be.
I don't know.
That's the thing.
I don't.
Games are really weird.
Mm hmm.
And asking for consistency with a copyright is I don't know to say to the fucking point
where all I wanted was to see John fucking complete his goddamn I don't know if I can
risk it.
Unfortunately, it's got to be covered because like this is a game, but, uh, wait, maybe
it stops at some.
Fuck that episode.
It pisses me the goddamn hell off.
I mean, it's a pretty good risk to do such a great soundtrack, you know?
Yeah.
There is no possible fucking way that they can redeem them.
Do you want to save that for the?
Yeah, actually, that makes a lot of sense.
We will save it.
Um, okay.
The game gameplay said that Mick Gordon doesn't copyright his tracks.
He's used them a bunch of times, apparently.
We're safe.
Oh, all right.
All right.
Apparently.
Themself, the next three, because who the fuck cares about the most useless fucking bitch
of the show?
Wait a minute.
The biggest fucking plot line of the entire series.
Because the whole point of the White Walkers was to show that the Game of Thrones is petty
useless and that they should stop bickering over retarded shit like that and fucking come
together to fight a threat bigger than them.
Well, now the threat that's bigger than them is fucking done.
And now they've got to go back arguing about dumb petty shit.
Well, if you're just mad, George RR Martin is better than Tolkien.
Tolkien would rape him.
The fucking ending hasn't even happened and it's already shit.
Blame Wolf.
If this gets taken down, motherfucker, I'm going off.
This is your fault, Wolf.
Your fault.
No, it's more than one of these.
Talking about pants.
Oh, God, I remember this.
More importantly, the pacing and design of games themselves.
Games are so much.
Where did she get that from?
It wasn't in her hand.
Is that going to go?
Wait, what?
Oh, the syringe.
So much.
The syringe?
Yeah, the syringe that she pulled out and stabbed the character with.
Is that like an American thing?
Isn't it syringe?
I've never heard it pronounced syringe.
Syringe syringe.
Well, I don't like when you were saying it's a scissors and everyone was
like, what are you talking about?
Look, that's not incorrect.
Well, no, it doesn't that way though.
Yeah, well, it's not correct.
They need to get with the old times.
Let's me OG rags.
Talk about scissors.
How do you pronounce scissors?
This is a scissors.
Yeah, scissors.
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't the contention.
It was like, but he said he said a scissors.
Okay.
Listen, we can have this discussion again.
I don't fucking care.
The point is that if I take my pants and I cut them down the middle, I
don't have, do I have a pant and then another pant and I put together and
they become pants or do I have pants?
You have two halves of pants.
You have two halves of a pair of pants.
So you have a pant.
That's why I pair of pants.
The pant is the leg, but they're connected at the top.
Isn't pants like short for like,
So now if you have two pairs of pants,
you say I have a pair of a pair of pants.
So if you have two matching pants,
you can't say a pair of pants because that's just one.
You say you have two pairs of pants,
but you could all,
but what if they match and you want to,
you want to signify that they match.
You say I have a pair of a pair of pants.
No, you have two pairs of pants.
Two pairs.
Yes.
Two matching pairs of pants.
Well, that's kind of redundant to say a matching pair.
Well, you just said you wanted to let people know that they're matching.
Oh yeah.
So you say a pair.
No, you have two pairs of pairs of pants.
No, you say two matching pairs of pants.
Two matching pairs.
What the fuck are you talking about?
And if you take scissors and you break them apart,
you have a scissor and another scissor.
No, you have a scissor blade.
And then you put them together and then it's because they have scissors.
No, people would say you have two pairs of scissor blades.
You don't say a scissors.
No one says a scissors.
It's a pair of scissors.
They used to.
Because I learned it from a Charlie Brown comic.
Well, Charlie Brown's like,
Charlie Brown tries his best.
Okay.
About the scissors.
I say pass the scissors, not pass the pair of scissors.
However, I understand that's probably growing.
Correct.
No, no, pass the scissors is still grammatically correct.
But a scissors is the thing that Rags said.
That's no one says that.
I probably say that too casually.
Yeah.
I'd still be.
I'd happily consider it'd be wrong.
I wouldn't care.
It's more like a slang thing.
Well, yeah, sure.
It doesn't matter if you say it's just, it's wrong.
So, um, he gets so much like a video.
No.
No.
Fuck movies.
Tone load is not being given these are really needs.
Okay.
Don't put the elevator music back on.
What is this?
Punch up.
Punch something right on the nest.
Punch out.
Is that it?
Because you can have one fist and another fist and that makes sense.
But you can't have a fist apparently.
Hands are implied.
Even though fists are connected.
No, they're not.
Yes, they are.
Fists.
Yes.
Fists are connected.
Every part of your body is connected.
Wolf.
Well, yeah.
Sure.
You did it.
I'm right.
You're wrong.
Got it.
I'm right.
You're wrong.
No.
No.
My two thumbs are not attached to each other.
Just like my two.
Yes, they are.
Yeah.
Everything from the boxing of every single whim is technically still attached to your
body as a whole.
My toe is connected to themselves.
Thumb bones connected to your hand bones.
Your hand bones connected to your arm bones.
Okay, Jared.
If there isn't another one, I think there was three.
Oh, yeah, there is.
So this was the other version of the big, hideous thing.
Let's do it.
Like super individual.
Oh, yeah.
Chats asking us to tell Aiden about if she knows about Freudian.
Oh, yeah.
So, you know, when someone says a Freudian slip, they're referring to the guy Freudian,
right?
Not Freud, because I would be a fucked up mistake.
His name is Freudian.
Not Freudian.
Oh, of course.
Yeah.
We may or may not have had.
Who even?
I've never heard of this man Freudian.
I mean, everyone knows Freudian.
We may or may not have had a guest who was convinced it was Freudian and we let them
run with it for a few seconds.
Oh, no.
Right.
So now we have Freudian and big idiots.
They are very galaxy brained individuals.
The Freudian and pupil big idiots are the first in history to engage in debate on the
trap question.
I want to read this out.
I'll do.
I'll do.
Are you going to be Freudian?
Okay, I'll be Freudian.
Are you going to be Freudian?
I'll be big idiots.
Dearest pupil, I beseech thee to abandon these explorations unto massivity.
The gods erected boykind to please girlkind, not thine tireless phallus.
Consider this honored mentor.
If it were a lad of most effete beauty and the room were dark, would it truly be queenly
to mount him in ignorance?
Imagine, if you will, the shadow of a youth cast on a wall in silhouette, the groin as
yet obscured.
As stimulating as I find such theoretical, the ancient wisdom remains unchanged.
If the balls do not come in contact, as a man are taken in the big gay.
But, my master, are you not in an effable champion of the subjective naturity of existence?
If all about us is but a mirage of our senses, then surely the big gay, too, is up to interpretation.
A world of our senses is surely subjective.
Never doubt that, fair beginners.
But within the framework of what our eyes and peems do tell us, your summertime fling
had a manhood beneath the stola.
Aught to confess to your wife, O people.
Leave big titties out of this.
And then we go from that to this meme, which is just a wonder.
I'm saving it.
Yeah, it's like slick editing.
I like it, the style.
This channel is Kaiser Mongol.
I shall now put this one in the chat as well, or at least a link to the video.
Check out more.
There is another one.
It is a tad too long for our purposes here.
Too long?
But we're probably going to check it out on the offline one.
What is too long for our purposes?
I think it's like a 24 minute meme.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that's.
That's a bit long.
Yeah, that's pretty long.
That is a long meme.
And as you know, we're not a fan of the long here.
That's the window.
Hate the long.
Can't stand it.
It should be short and sweet and concise.
It should be 65 minutes or less.
Should be like a mouse.
This is some old good rap.
You guys ready?
Yes.
Oh my God.
Can spiders actually tell the future?
I read that as rats.
I was like.
What makes good rats?
People who are.
Quality, quality.
Image.
And then to sweat, to segue then.
I have a problem being a puppet.
This one zero one mean.
Oh, that's one hundred and one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't even remember that.
I don't remember what the context of that.
Oh my goodness.
God damn it, Kyle.
Ben.
Okay.
He's sexual harassment.
Like when I was like, when I was like,
he seems like the kind of person.
You want to hurt him by talking to him.
Michael.
Sarah is the red Prius of actors.
My name is not.
You see this pile of papers.
Sword like weapon.
And a grape is like a.
Some of these highlights are really good.
It's really crazy to have it all lined up all of the classic
memes, like their origins.
Oh man.
Don't know,
but I think we're going to be able to do some, some,
some history out there.
So this is a next step in the E fap animated series from plagued.
Like Dink, like Incorporate.
I think.
Okay.
Okay.
I love how we've hijacked the Avengers theme.
Oh, let's pause, alright, so, YouTube is in chaos.
Copyright strikes have spread far and wide, engulfing the galaxy in what some call the
big gay.
Plague Creations, that's the name.
An ally of EFAP has animated this tangent, making this title crawl an obvious pause spot
for meme hunters.
Can you spot the four other EFAP guests?
Amidst the YouTube chaos, Maul and his team of EFAP agents have infiltrated the celestially
epic battle station, the Death Star, and have made an unexpected discovery, also high rags.
You know, you know the guy that you see press the lever on the Death Star?
He was a bad character.
I mean, what do we know about his life?
Does he have any hobbies?
Does he play tennis?
You know, he was just having a good day at work.
He called his daughter, he's like, yeah, I'll be home late, you know, I'm late at work,
but, you know, go to bed early, tell your mum I love her, you know, I love that kid.
He's blissfully unaware of what the station even does.
He's just like, I just work for the Empire, you know, try to put food on the table.
I tell you to push a button and pull a lever, and it makes a very huge sound, and I do.
You know, my wife got injured on the job.
You know, Darth Vader comes by, he's like, good work, good job, you're doing a good job,
you're not pulling that lever.
I don't know.
Hey, honey, Darth Vader, complimented me.
Honey, make a cake for Vader.
Vader's coming over for dinner.
Could you imagine, like, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god,
oh god, oh god, oh god.
And he's like, oh, hmm, that was very good.
I was passing my compliments on to the Emperor for you.
He's like, I'm moving up, honey, you know, I might be working with the Emperor.
I just got to go to work tomorrow, and you know, all I got to do is flick a lever, it's
going to be great.
I'll see you tomorrow, then he blows up, and it's just like, his wife.
And when you walk to Darth, those upper positions are always, you know, becoming available,
so you're always moving up in the middle.
There's a lot of room for growth, a lot of potential for moving up.
You have the celebration, the medal scene in A New Hope, it all works out, and then
there's this epilogue scene where these series of stormtroopers arrive in a car, and they
come out with this whole thing, there's this whole house, there's the wife in it.
A folded empire flag?
Yeah, she's got it all taken out of her arm, she's like, I've just got the spaghetti
bolognese is ready for this, you know what I'm saying?
I'm like, what are you doing with this bloody ship, it's fucked, mate!
She's like, god, shit.
Oh, I'm sorry.
God, imagine how many people they'd have to visit for that, you know, and they'd have
to go out a million times.
He wasn't a good character too, so fuck him.
Ten grenade.
Negative 50 BBY to zero.
Or tilde, rather.
There was that Star Wars guild cameo right at the beginning-ish, then there was the watching,
or we were in the background debating water.
You've got the family picture back there as well.
That was very good!
There's a little, like a five-year-old version of the person in the empire uniform.
Yeah, the whole family address the same way.
But that's plague creations, I shall also post him in the chat.
Oh my.
We love his animations, more the merrier.
They're very good, those are always a delight to watch.
It cannot be understated how much work goes into him, it's wonderful.
I feel like when we were coming up with that, I remember feeling like, oh, this could be
animated easily, with how much fucking lols they're coming up with, it's good shit.
But yes, ten grenade didn't make it.
Just a bunch of F's in the chat now.
Efforten, one might say.
Alright, and this is the last one for the videos today.
Oh my.
I just, I picture, right, and then the extra credits man comes into this kid's room and
he's like, do you know who you're playing as?
And he goes, this needs to stop.
The entire problem is solved by a single conversation.
Let everyone clap.
They're awesome.
You know.
Someday someone's going to make an absurdly detailed 60FPS animation and it's going to
scare the hell out of them.
I'm starting to wonder why people are going to start looking back and finding all the
choice quotes they can actually use.
Oh man, this is a long one.
Come on dude, you do that kind of shit to me all the time.
Pip pip doodly doo, everyone.
Pip pip doodly doo.
Pip pip doodly doo.
Pip pip doodly doo.
Poodle pip and poodle doo.
Have a good day wolf.
I fucking thought that Jay would.
Second.
I had a beer.
Hello.
Oh dear.
The projectile.
All it would take is some conscious planning of the environment they're located in.
Granted, this means that we'd probably have to lock down our dialogue a bit early.
Oh my god, Molly, this reminds me of that one.
I said that a great is like a weird olive.
No, it's not a weird olive.
It is a weird olive.
It's nuts.
No, I don't want 50 people to get herpes.
That would be terrible.
I want 50 people to get herpes.
You're such a massive.
Well, no, here's the thing.
If you're going to buy.
Oh, they got the burning door.
They got the burning door.
Fucking.
Hey.
What is the philosophy ever due to her?
Paul.
What is the status?
Paulu ski.
Paulu ski.
When wolf was shot out by the fucker.
Oh, that's so good.
I've got a gift for that.
Oh my god.
So I'm going to go get some victory.
James Moore is the Nintendo switch.
The fucking infinite helmets I was putting on.
Mahler casually wears two helmets.
He's got to protect his feet.
Fuck off.
I'm a happy nut.
And your rhino milk.
And my rhino milk.
Terrorist rule.
Hey, look at.
Hellblade.
Terrorist rule.
Rex is.
Hey, everyone.
There's a woman.
I have the power, which means that I can bully whatever man I wish.
Oh, my God.
Sausage raider.
A lot of things happened in here.
Sober has been split into two batters.
Cosmic chicken.
Cosmic chicken with the egg.
This is a depiction of.
Oh, the yellow pipe.
Yeah, with sausage.
Oh, yeah.
It's got the yellow pipe.
The dog is smiling upon.
Tonal does he defeats a dark evil.
Interesting.
Jared.
This means.
Oh, yeah.
The.
Tonal is defeating Jared.
Is that bats?
Are they bats there?
I don't know if that's a part of the original drawing or not.
Next to Jared's head is bats.
Bats.
I don't.
For whatever reason.
This is why it's just better to stay with.
At this point.
Yeah.
You know, look, if women just.
I got a question for you.
Choices for themselves.
None of this would be an issue.
They're so tightly ugly.
I mean, who would you rather be looking at that?
I think I'd rather be looking down the barrel of the gun.
If she'd been the dawn.
Would you?
Oh, my God.
By that or would you.
Oh, look, it's a skeleton.
And I'm in the Hot Wheels thing on the wall.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
You know, this meme selection has been like a throwback
to all the really old memes.
It's great.
It's a great way to.
You're really good.
And.
There's so many of them could revisit the old ones.
It's like they're new all over again.
If she had been the.
No, no, no, no, no.
He is the dawn shoes have to be done away.
It's time to warm up the Evans.
I am.
And that was definitely a good.
You're next.
Since since.
No.
He's doing all right.
Oh, back when we called him.
Since since.
Oh, yeah.
So those are the days.
So.
All right.
YouTubers list breads.
What?
In that.
Yeah.
I think.
Did it go out of its way to tell you that the person you're
playing was pressed into service under threat of their life?
No.
Terrors.
Terrors.
No loud soup.
And that's why it's so tragic.
Because in The Force Awakens, the tragedy is that Kylo will
destroy her pussy.
It's just so much about it.
That's like her titty meat jiggles a little bit.
Like this boy.
Slice and dice.
Yeah.
This is this is what Hitler wanted.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, boy.
This is bad on so many levels.
We can stop helping to normalize Nazis.
Why is my brain failing me?
What?
What?
What noise is that from?
Okay.
I know.
I was thinking the same thing.
That's the zombies from Call of Duty Black Ops.
Oh, that's it.
Oh.
Oh god.
Oh, here we are.
Oh Jesus Christ.
Holy fuck!
I have never seen a more terrifying red dish than me.
Oh my god!
I'm sitting in my room!
I have a pentagram on my chest!
Hello there ladies and gentlemen.
Goliath.
Huh.
E-fat blood for the E-fat gods?
Marked dose.
I'm not gonna call it pot dose.
Damn it! You made me all invested!
Fuck a son of a bitch!
Fuck!
Fuck.
Orange juice is the best of all that juice.
Really? Alcatism cured critically?
Music is copyright free, don't worry, no need to pause.
Lights, creative commons, free download.
Like credits, I guess.
It's a long credits, he wins.
Oh, I think that's original.
I think it's original, yeah.
It's kind of old school.
Yeah.
Oh, I think that's original.
I think it's original, yeah.
It's kind of old school.
Yeah.
Huh.
All those elements.
Is that total?
It might be.
Super science away.
That's the view.
Is that, uh, CJ in there? Maybe.
He's a great little droids though.
Yeah, he's really cute.
Thanks.
He made that sound live!
That's so good!
I'm pushing F's to the chicken.
The cosmic chicken.
Oh my god.
I don't know if we're expected to read all of that.
What happened to Rex?
Oh no.
Oh jesus.
It doesn't really look like that.
It's really good.
Hey, you got the one right.
Does it bite you?
Does it be the point?
Is that total space?
That's Aiden sleeping on a cloud.
That is, yeah, she got the martini go.
People call me.
Yes!
Yay!
I've got a smile for me, huh?
A bunch of rhino milks in the chat.
I only read manga, dude.
Oh god, that was from the, uh...
That was from the Geeky Gamer stream.
Huh.
I haven't heard that in a while.
Yes.
Oh, that was wonderful.
That was really great. That was wonderful.
I almost shed a little manly doggo tear there.
That was very sweet.
I really like that.
That was a really amazing original artwork.
A lovely little, lovely little song to go along with it.
That was lovely.
Mm-hmm.
I second all of those comments.
I loved it.
That was great.
Such incredible talent.
There's the video, posting in chat.
Flick away, folks.
It's incredible.
Like I said, there's a whole bunch more memes.
There's more than double the ones we went through,
but they're all copyright-related ones,
so we are going to tackle those in a recording at a later date.
For now, though, it's over to Picture Memes.
Picture Memes.
Of which, oh my.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
There's a couple.
Make a big picture pie.
We got, um, they're from all over the place.
I did my best to order them in some way, shape, or form.
It didn't work out very well.
Oh no.
We're just going to check out some Picture Memes.
Is that all right, everybody?
Yeah, absolutely.
Let's do it.
Thank goodness.
All right.
So this is the first one.
Some of these may be in the position I've been shown before.
I do not know 100%.
Set the coordinates for China.
Oh, it's Flute Musician.
We defeated Flute Musician more than once.
He came onto my stream.
He did.
I defeated him like hardcore in the stream.
Super Chat readings.
I fucking killed him straight away.
I was proud of myself.
Um.
I guess this is a rendition of Movie Bomb of some kind.
It's very flattering.
Oh my God.
That is very flattering.
He'd need like a mouse in his hand in order to sort of.
He seems almost human.
Yeah.
Not far off.
Good stuff.
Yeah.
Um.
I just control C this shit.
It would make it easier.
We've got Confluxious and Brigidious.
I think they conflicted at certain points.
But may the rat be good?
It is possible.
The rat is only understand by society of clowns.
These are pieces of information to really think about over the course of many thinking hours.
Um.
After the comment about wearing a dress.
I'm Tran's dad.
He's like connect from that.
Wait I just said connect.
Just today.
So yeah.
That's a nice fresh one.
Oh we got a whole combo of old and new memes here.
Old and new.
Sounds good.
Speak to yourself.
The more Jeb memes the merrier.
At this point you'll just be like let's hope we can make this a reality one day you know.
Jeb needs that gauntlet.
Don't let your memes be dreams.
We don't always reference Hitler whenever.
Yeah.
Though that actually reminds me after we've got the picture memes done we've got that.
Oh that reminds me Hitler.
Actually yes.
We've got that thing where we have to decide on whether a quote is from MovieBob or Hitler.
That's actually something we can do today as well.
I figure Wolf would find that pretty fun.
We still have to play the game.
What game.
You know is this MovieBob.
Is this a MovieBob quote or a Hitler.
Yes we have that game is ready to be done.
Also again just to remind people.
The remaining eFap videos that you'd want to be seen.
Wolf's going to check those out as well in like an eFap mini.
They will be covered by him as well as us.
Just to be safe on not making sure this stream doesn't go down.
Is this an example of good art.
Should be good rat but you know.
Yep.
We know what makes it good.
Yep.
So therefore we can assess what differentiates good and bad art.
The way for everyone to analyze is to be on a subjective analysis.
Makes sense to me.
Is this objectivity or not.
Stop denying my opinion you bigot.
But you have to remember that.
That you know by saying something is good or bad objectively.
You have essentially ended the conversation and you are a bad person.
There's no more discussion that can take place afterwards.
We certainly don't have discussions here.
And we don't talk about things.
Hey Wolf you were there for that stream.
The dad dog guy who suggested the alternative Joker film.
It changed everything.
Oh yeah.
He's a good liar Jay.
You're covering Nendo.
He's a good liar Jay.
Oh do you remember it was it was what's it called collider.
The guy said go suck on a toad fart.
We were all just like to toad fart.
Oh.
I think this is the second meme and it's the same guy who depicts critical
as a bottle of alcohol.
I'm not against that.
I like it.
Such a strange like specific thing to go to.
Yeah it that is an odd one.
So you got the guy who makes like false movie synopsis.
So Jeb Zilla versus King Diabeto.
After the dastardly Diabeto's defeat at the hands of professor exercise.
He is burning with revenge.
When the ominous Uchi provides Diabeto with a serum of geode milk.
The serum transforms Diabeto into the ultimate form.
King Diabeto.
Jeb knows the only way to stop King Diabeto is to become a monster.
Jeb Zilla.
So I think that film's coming in 2020.
Look out for it.
We certainly will be.
Review pending.
Jeb an angry Jew.
Angry Jew.
That was funny.
I guess this is an example of how we tangent.
But you got George Lucas sells Disney to Star Wars eventually.
We got on to Jeb Bush acts with the fan fiction.
That's totally natural.
It's perfect sense to me.
Oh God.
I don't know.
There's lots of implications with this image.
Don't hurt me, Jenny.
All I need to do is turn up in a car and I'll be safe, right?
Yeah.
It's like your band of hooligans will save you.
Oh my God.
Massive.
Got one of them movie titles.
Classics.
If you have three of the suitory in the search for total.
Oh, look at that.
That's a pretty nifty little logo there.
I will say that obviously if I fall came out where we found tonal.
But well, maybe that was the finale of this film.
I don't know.
But either way he came back.
He came back with his best review ever.
And ironically, that's probably the best video he's ever made.
Yeah, I was finding myself agreeing with what I what agreeing more than disagreeing.
Yeah, because you guys don't have the greatest things to say about that game.
And he had quite a lot of great things to say.
And he and he's tonaled and he still managed to make a video that wasn't that bad.
How do you do it?
We'll never know.
I mean, the fact that we're ending off with tonal actually being good is quite heartwarming.
Saving majorly.
I love man majorly of the one point two billionth.
Arby has been separated from his squad of fellow pay for Arby while his squad debates whether to leave him behind or not.
Majorly must survive on the Isle of Man dodging three legged rolling monsters and a beast legend known as the long man.
Thank God.
Why is it?
Why are you always depicted with fucking tentacles coming out of your face?
I like it.
Oh, I don't dislike it.
I just like I wonder.
More behind that or something.
No.
Slender man.
I said splendor.
I was thinking about sugar.
Oh, my God.
I thought it was like Splenda, like the sugar substitute.
And I got those mixed.
There are there are questions to be asked, I suppose.
Bletch.
Bletch.
What is with Ray's face on this as well?
Is that the normal look?
It's her lip.
She looks like she's constipated.
It looks like perfect.
She looks wrong.
Or am I just crazy?
Oh, no, it does.
It's probably part of the original.
OK, well, I'm not going to judge.
We'll get in trouble, remember?
You can't do that.
I don't even.
This might be a part of like a series of images that I may have lost.
I'm not even sure.
But Patrick Willems is entering a plot hole and it's for him.
Plot holders specifically for him.
We can enjoy the movies more.
Got our son, neutron stars, black holes in terms of density.
You know, that's some that's some deep lore in there.
Pretty hard provisions.
I like this.
I want to see this movie.
The wags.
Yay.
Yay.
I guess we got toxic brood.
Atlantis, the Lost Empire.
Treasure Planet Disney, Star Wars fans, Frozen 2, Star Wars.
So we are pointing at Star Wars.
Star Wars fans are crying.
And then Disney with Frozen 2, Treasure Planet and Atlantis and the Oz Empire.
I'm a little confused.
Treasure Planet and Atlantis haven't become horrible remakes yet, right?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Yeah.
Sorry about that, everyone, but inevitable.
I heard they were making a there.
Yeah.
We learned they were making that live action Robin Hood.
Mm hmm.
Oh, God.
Yeah.
No, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God.
That's horrifying.
They're all horrifying.
They just don't stop.
The Lord of the Massives, the fellowship of the event.
So the dawn is Frodo.
You get to be Aragorn.
Which one am I?
I can't tell from this.
Here, Gandalf.
Oh, okay.
Let's go.
I'm Legolas, because I could tell because I have the long blonde hair.
No, that's Galadriel.
No, I'm Legolas.
I got the long blonde hair.
Galadriel also has long blonde hair.
Well, that's who E.R. is.
No.
I see what you're doing.
E.R. is Legolas.
No.
Yeah.
No, Legolas has a bow.
And E.R. has a bow.
No, he's got some weird.
He's holding, he's got it.
It looks like a spear.
He's holding it in front of him.
You could see the, see it sticking up like that.
I am Legolas because I have the long blonde hair.
And I have long hair in real life, so it just makes sense.
Just one color change.
And I'm basically Orlando Bloom from 20 years ago.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to drown in that Mad Elf pussy.
You saying you disagree with them all?
You're going to present a counter?
I'm going to have to take the L on this.
My logic is solid.
Okay.
Yeah, I thought you'd fight for the position, but I guess you're conceding.
Rags was right.
He is indeed Legolas.
Let me know that I am Legolas.
Yeah, cool stuff.
I thought it was something else, but I was wrong.
This is, um...
Oh, man.
I cannot wait for this movie to come out.
So, the bottle in the movie is not that bottle.
This means that this is a production image that was taken for him practicing milking this thing.
Oh, my God.
Yeah.
Enjoy that.
He had to do multiple takes as well as practicing milking this piece of shit.
I'm so sorry, Mark.
So sorry.
Look at what you've become.
You've become the very thing you swore to destroy.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What now?
Oh, nothing to do with this stream.
I'm sorry, bad video essay.
Is this, because I am ill educated, is this Metal Gear Solid?
That would be my guess.
It's one of the Metal Gears, right?
Isn't that like a Psycho Manus or something?
I've never played a single Kojima game ever, so...
Wow.
What's with the Asian hate?
What's that about?
Ah, you know, it's just not...
It goes quietly, I knew it.
Ephaps angels.
Major Lee has developed...
Of course Rex is in the first...
Yeah, boy.
Major Lee has developed a terrifying weapon for Disney.
Something that will turn...
Something that will turn, give everyone Eric Butt's mind for Disney stars.
Absolute control.
Major Lee must be stopped from activating the weapon by any means,
even if it means he will get to look at woman.
I may have had a lot of vodka by now, but that is actually how it's written, okay?
That is the synopsis, how dare you?
When someone asks Theta Roberto why he likes themed-isms.
I am a critic, themes are part of my religion.
So, undeniably true.
This is how girls argue, how boys argue.
Should the government fund Elon Musk's cat-gills research?
Yes.
The answer is yes.
The answer is yes.
Yes, absolutely.
For the good of us all.
That's just like my opinion, man.
You've got all over the background as well.
No, it is Harlow in the back.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know if Toenold would team up with I Hit Everything, but...
Amidst the bowling bowls.
We've got another rendition of an Efap Lord of the Rings.
This time Rags is Legolas, nice.
I'm always Legolas.
I don't see it.
Yeah, it doesn't pop up for me.
I should have posted the bowling one twice.
I am so sorry.
There you go.
You retard mauler.
I don't know.
It's not me.
Oh my god, Erics.
The chat is Sam.
Always ever faithful, Sam.
I've been cursed by the mauler plague.
I've actually been full of mauler fads the next 11 hours.
Oh my.
Dude, he's going to make a video response to your tweets.
It's going to be six hours long.
This is so good.
Jesus.
Undialated.
Yeah, this is what is a standard for anti-mauler slash Efap jokes.
They go, he's going to make a 10 hour response to your tweet.
That's what it amounts to.
I think our memes are better.
That's my opinion.
That's my subjective opinion.
We have some pretty amazing memes and we have a whole fleet of amazing meme makers.
Oh my god.
Ooh boy.
I guess this was Rags doing a little tool shop, I suppose.
Popping in.
Little modeling work, you know, gotta look good for the hammers.
This was when, uh, no bullshit described Jay as a vulture on no bullshit's content.
And then I was like, Jay, you get that means that he considers himself dead.
Like I'm sure vultures kill live things, but typically they're associated with picking at dead flesh, right?
Or at least dead things.
Mm hmm.
Most people say about vultures.
Same for hyenas.
They have the same reputation.
How, how sad.
Yeah.
Hyenas are all, they're capable hunters.
This is, I think the Sims Rags is a rendition of Rags and the Sims.
Oh, it says a male though.
I'm so sorry.
We've got it.
What are those, wait, what are those glasses though?
Let me zoom in.
It's kind of like a sticker.
Rateism, round head, kind of majorly.
That's really cool though.
Mm hmm.
And I'm Rags.
Rateism, round head.
Oh, so is this like a, is this like a mod you could make?
Because it has a file size attached to it.
I think so.
I'm not 100% sure.
I've got a couple of links to that one.
Huh.
This is a movie I mean to watch with both of you.
Have you either seen, either of you seen Seven Psychopaths yet?
Uh, no, I have not seen Seven.
It is the movie maker who made In Bruges, which I adore.
He made this movie.
And I'm actually, I typically argue it's better than In Bruges.
It's funny as fuck.
Well, I definitely want to watch it because when you showed me In Bruges,
I loved that movie.
Maybe we should watch it sometime.
We should do that.
The dawn has been murdered and there are only seven main suspects.
All of them have a motive, but Moeller can't figure out who could pull it off.
With detective Ham Hawk now on the case,
the mystery deepens and turns deadly as Moeller is found dead.
Detective Ham Hawk will need his smarts and wits
to crack these seven masses before it's too late.
Who do you think would commit the murder?
I'm immediately going with Captain Marvel.
Captain Marvel absolutely would commit murder.
Yeah.
She basically has.
Legal Eagle would defend her.
I don't think he'd commit the murder, you know?
Yeah.
Colin Farrell.
Well, that's what he wants you to think.
Well, he's a good cover, I suppose.
The soldier carried his service dog down a mountain
because it was 117 degrees and the rocks were burning his paws.
Could you just give him little doggy booties?
We don't have a funding for that.
Oh.
See, this is why you need to elect a president who can afford doggy booties.
That's the main.
That's such a nice thing that you're doing for me.
Carrying me across that desert.
On the way to on the search for memes.
Um.
Springy.
Shad is the most likely to kill someone.
He has the most weapons rags.
Are you challenging me?
I do.
I do have a scary amount of things.
Yes.
Terrifying, if you will.
Fucking love that you shag.
He's challenging me.
Part bad.
Part scooter.
All Bob.
All Bob.
Robo.
Robo.
No, it's it's Robob.
Bob.
Robob.
It's Robob.
People actually started to notice rags that when we begin some videos,
instead of immediately saying it's terrible,
you describe it as strange until you've seen enough.
Yeah.
It's very strange.
What does that caption say?
The number of ways you could rephrase that.
My God.
I think I must have heard you say that both of those things a
thousand times.
Yeah.
Oh, it's perfect.
Oh my goodness.
This one.
With the algorithms, it's a lot here.
So during a given six hour stream,
at least two hours worth of superchas will be sent by ravenous,
disgusting members of the toxic brood debasing himself.
The streamer will respond to each of these in length,
rubbing elbows with the pros.
By the time two hours have been expended to respond to each audience
comment.
Another hour's worth of new superchas have been sent,
requiring our hosts to continue this humiliating exercise.
All the while, new messages will arrive.
Each time a portion of superchas reaches its end,
a new one must be dealt with in an endless recursion,
ipso facto quadrata demonstrandum,
facto et logico,
refell it that a stream can literally never end.
And we'll continue in perpetuity.
Weep for this wretched man and locked in his internal torment
like Tantalus, Sisyphus or Prometheus.
Thus spokeeth Vigidius.
Amen.
Yeah, man.
He was so far ahead of his time.
He was.
Crazy.
He was...
Oh, if we drop him off in modern times and he'd be like,
yeah, is that what I thought?
I mean, he's what I would call prophetic.
We got knobs here.
Oh, boy.
Because here's the thing.
Everything is SJW.
Everything is anti-white.
Everything is part of the Zionist conspiracy,
and you have to point it all out.
Oh, my goodness.
Don't know why he is.
There you go, knobs.
It's crazy.
You're just a fat, uglier, negative Sarkeesian.
I know.
Yeah.
The clown is feeling pain.
I am happy and think it is very interesting.
Conflucious.
The conflucious one.
Where did that come from?
I've completely forgotten because I'm retarded.
I don't remember.
Man, I don't think I remember.
Someone in the chat will.
Oh, my God.
We need to watch Has been Hotel.
There's so many references to it.
We have no idea what it is.
Yeah, I haven't seen it.
Me and Fringy watched it within minutes of it coming out.
Oh, is it good?
Yeah.
Could me and Max see it?
Yeah, it's it's just the pilot of the show.
But they got the funding now to actually start making more episodes.
So I'm pretty eager to see where they go with it.
Not really much happens.
It's just like a proof of concept more than anything.
But it's a fun proof of concept.
All right.
Yeah, let's do it.
Is it better than Mandalorian?
Well, I haven't seen the Mandalorian.
Well, I've seen the Mandalorian or the Mandalorian.
Yeah.
Why haven't you seen the Mandalorian yet?
Because I don't want to.
That's not a reason to not do something.
What?
What do you mean it's not a reason not to do something?
Where would you be if you just didn't do all the things you didn't want to do?
Well, that's the.
Can you imagine a world like that?
Where people just didn't do the things they didn't want to do?
I guess.
Well.
Then my point should be proved just from that.
Just from your imagining you should be in agreement.
So well, you can see then that you must watch Mandalorian even though you don't want to.
Correct.
No.
Oh.
So the argument goes on.
It's something for us to talk about.
I don't want to watch it.
Well, do you not want to talk about it with us?
I don't want to watch it to talk about it.
Don't you know how good it is?
You guys have told me that it looks really bad after episodes.
I know you'll love it and we could talk about it.
We can talk about how bad it is together.
If it gets bad after episode two, then why would I talk about it?
Rags and I have said nothing but good things about Mandalorian.
I love Mandalorian beginning bits.
I enjoy Mandalorian episode one.
See, you start off high.
You like being high, right, Wolf?
Yeah.
You're one of those.
You're a blazer.
You're a.
You're a.
You like the cosmic trail as the kids say.
You like to poof the poof if you know what I'm talking about.
You like to light up and smoke the devil's lettuce.
You like to partake of the lotus.
The Mandalorian's lettuce, if you will.
Yeah, if you buy in what I'm telling you like to,
you like to inhale the narcotic fumes.
What the fuck are we doing here?
I hope that my euphemisms for drug use.
The new episode has Bill Burr.
Don't you want to watch it?
Yeah.
The new episode has Bill Burr as a character.
He is funnyman.
You like Bill Burr?
Why is Bill Burr in that way?
You know, that's a good question.
Considering his character isn't funny or likable in any way.
I don't know if I liked him.
I liked it.
Well, I guess I guess he was fine.
But like you would think that if you hired a famous talented comedian like Bill Burr,
you'd be like, hey, maybe he'll make us laugh once or twice because he's a comedian
and he makes jokes.
Well, you would be mistaken.
This is Disney Star Wars.
Yeah, but he's not even a half bad actor in general.
He just comes across as like real.
That's what I mean.
You have to be funny.
Does he have to be funny?
You don't see a character.
Wait.
Okay.
Actually, let's pitch the joke he makes to Wolf.
See what Wolf thinks.
All right.
I can't actually remember what it is.
I got it.
I got it.
So, so Mandalorian meets up with this, this crew that he's going to be doing.
Okay.
I know.
Classic Mandalorian.
So, uh, Bill Burr is part of this crew and he's all, you know,
like this is a crew.
He, you know, why is Bill Burr on the team?
And he has like a million guns.
He has guns strapped to his chest.
It's kind of embarrassing.
He has like five guns.
We'll just, we can, that's fine.
It's great, actually.
It helps.
He's got more guns than hands.
At one point, someone takes one off his chest and he doesn't do anything about it.
So just take it.
It doesn't matter.
So you might be thinking to yourself like, oh, well, what's the point in having five guns
if you're not even a good shot?
And so the boss guy is like, nah, man.
He's a great shot.
He is an ex-imperial, uh, sharpshooter.
Imperial, meaning with the empire, right?
And then Mandalorian, I can't remember if he says something specific, but he gives him
that there is an exchange that implies stormtroopers are bad aims, bad shots.
And then Bill Burr is like, I wasn't a stormtrooper.
Yeah.
He says I wasn't a stormtrooper, smart ass.
What do you think?
Well, okay.
Your delivery was kind of catastrophic, but the point of delivery, I don't even think
that's how it went.
Yeah.
No, he says smart.
He says I wasn't a stormtrooper, smart ass.
He says, he says that at the end.
Sure.
But like the buildup is important.
Okay.
Give me the, do it.
You do it better.
Do it.
I don't, I don't even remember it.
I just know that.
Oh, so you call someone else out.
I don't remember what the shape of Italy is.
But if I saw it, I'd know it was wrong.
You can't.
No, no, no, no.
You, if you can't make the last Jedi, you cannot criticize it.
I don't know what the hell is happening here.
Okay.
The point is, the point is one, I couldn't make the last Jedi.
If I tried to that, the Mandalorian has confirmed in universe that stormtroopers not being able
to shoot is an actual thing.
Yeah.
So like, like he's like, Oh, I'm a pro Imperial guy.
And then Mandalorian is like lol.
And then he's like, I wasn't a fucking stormtrooper smart.
Stormtroopers smart ass, as if to say stormtroopers are canonically stupid and can't aim properly.
Even though that's not a thing at all that actually exists, the whole stormtroopers can't
aim is built off of people not understanding that they weren't.
They specifically weren't trying to hit people in episode four.
What?
Do you remember?
Yeah, not only that you're right.
But Obi-Wan says that they're like really fucking good.
Do you remember that?
Like Imperial stormtroopers.
Fucking terrifying.
They will they will melt your aunt and uncle at the moment.
They will fuck you up.
So don't mess with them.
So like it, it's frustrating.
It was frustrating to me in ranks to hear this acknowledged that stormtroopers suck.
They are trying to.
They are.
Is this Disney?
This just their their latest greatest attempt to do what they can to chip away at the OT.
Like remember the OT.
Yeah.
Shit.
I suppose you could apply it to the sequels as well.
I suppose you're in that too.
Um, this sounds terrible.
Why would I ever want to watch this?
No, this was no, no, no.
Wolf.
No, no, no.
This was only this was only but a taste.
This was only but this episode is way worse than that.
Yeah.
And I want to clarify though.
I thought Bill Boo was he did.
He did what he does fine.
I suppose I would say that for every actor actress actor person in all of the Mandalorian.
Everyone's doing what they can.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't think of any bad actors.
Can I don't think I can.
Wolf.
Can you think of any bad actors?
Yeah.
Well, you've seen it.
What do you think?
Yeah.
What the fuck is happening?
We're asking you if you think there's any bad actors or actresses.
Like bad faith actors in Mandalorian.
Other than Disney.
Mm hmm.
As a whole.
Yeah.
In the entirety.
Mm hmm.
There.
I don't.
I don't think there are any.
Either.
I agree.
Literally all I've seen of the Mandalorian.
Baby Yoda memes.
Baby Yoda's doing character that is still consistent.
Yeah.
He is.
Yeah.
Basically.
You know what?
It's funny.
Me you.
Sorry.
Wait.
Yeah.
No.
Friggy.
Metal me you.
I feel like we're the full people in this fucking universe that have the take that we
have of Mandalorian.
Where it started good.
It just got worse.
Because everyone else seems to think that it started bad.
It got good.
Well we can back ours up though.
And then we talked with someone and he was.
We convinced him.
So once you actually like get people into a discussion and say here's all the reasons
why it's terrible.
We're not saying he can't like it.
You're sad.
But we're just saying here's why it's terrible.
The um.
He like well for reference in episode six.
When we watched with six right.
Six.
Yeah.
The last one.
He passed the halfway point.
So he like gets a crew in six for the first time he's not like ever worked with a crew
and the crew consists of Clancy Brown right who if you don't know.
The most well known position I think people would know him from is he's the drill sergeant
in Starship Troopers.
He's quite cool.
Every role he was in Highlander.
I don't know if maybe Google Clancy Brown you probably know him.
You got him.
Then you got Tonks.
What's her name?
Is Adora Tonks from Harry Potter.
There's also um the wildling from Game of Thrones.
You know I'm talking about wildling.
The girl one who turns good and helps Bran what's her name.
Oh I don't fucking know the game is the show forgot about it.
They brought it back to killer.
Yes you're right.
But but her to them to build a he died in Game of Thrones.
Yeah.
Spoilers.
How does she die.
I don't even remember.
I guess the seduce Ramsey Ramsey Bolton he just fucking kills her.
Oh OSHA.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh I thought you were talking about the other one like the girl that Bran sent away and
then she just never appeared again.
Oh shit.
Clancy Brown was the voice of Mr. Krabs.
I didn't even know that.
Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs is voiced by a woman.
Clancy is a female name right.
What's happening.
Okay so.
And the last person is Richard sorry Richard Iowad who I was watching the analytics review
of the episode and he says I weighed I think and I don't blame him for it.
Such a fucking weird name.
It's just like a collection of vowels.
But the only reason I pronounce it that way is because that's what I've heard him say
his own name as on panel shows in Britain.
I can't wait to see who plays Darth.
Yes.
But it was a really cool crew I think in terms of actors and roles to play.
You know it could have really worked.
I just didn't like the episode at all.
There you go.
We reviewed Mad Lori and Rex.
We did it.
Oh yay.
Thank goodness we got that done because I think people getting upset that we hadn't
talked about it.
All right listen chat.
That's finally caught up.
First off.
Fuck you.
Clancy sounds like a woman's name.
I would never name my son Clancy.
That's like Nancy Drew's sister Clancy Drew.
You'd name your daughter Clancy?
I wouldn't name.
I wouldn't I wouldn't name anyone clampsy maybe I would name like a tool like a wrench
or something.
I might name it clampsy.
I wouldn't name a human being clamsy or clancy.
I would just avoid it all together.
Even if her sister Nancy was going around solving mystery.
I haven't said anything unreasonable yet.
What have I said this unreasonable?
I haven't.
I didn't say you said you have.
You told the joke unreasonably and it killed the joke.
It was hilarious.
We both died laughing.
Wait hang on.
I thought you didn't like the joke.
I thought that was the point.
I hope I'm not the only one that hasn't been just obscenely confused for the past ten
minutes.
Do you guys want to go back to watching Mean Pictures?
Is that it?
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.
All right.
We can do that.
What was the point of our um what actually was the little point of this?
To tell Wolf that they made a joke about stormtroopers being unable to aim properly
in universe.
It bothers me.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm glad we made it.
So this is has been hotel again.
This is actually not oh shit.
It's uh fuck I forget what the title of it is.
I actually liked it more than hotel but from like the same team.
You know this sea hell of a boss.
Yeah.
That's what it was.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I actually liked it a lot more than has been hotel thought it was a little bit more charming.
Uh why would anyone send me this?
I don't remember the context of this specific scene but I don't think it needs it.
The important thing is rags of movie bob do not get on.
Oh I sent you the I swear to god I copied it correctly.
This is it's getting harder okay that's all I'm gonna say you got the daily the major
contains images of women got 1.2 billion readers voting has started for the biggest massive
of 2019 which celebrity will win the popular vote only man to vote for Jeb found at last
I'm not political the anonymous man claims I felt sorry for the guy it seems that tonald
has been missing this is an old newspaper obviously he has been found thankfully clearly
after three years of extensive research a lone person who supported the presidential
bid of John Ellis wait is that why he's called Jeb is it John Ellis Bush is that actually
why he's called I thought it's just I just thought his name was Jeff I thought his name
was just Jeff because he's from Texas and that sounds like something they do did they
honestly why would you call him Jeb instead of John is that true John is a way better
name the Jeb okay okay okay okay okay okay I'm gonna Google this we need to know the
how you think you're gonna just be a fucking bush John Ellis Jeb Bush oh my god I had no
idea I thought his name was Jeb it actually makes not not that much sense but slightly
more sense why his why his why his slogan was Jeb but with an exclamation point because it stands
for John Ellis Bush that's terrible yeah Bush which it doesn't make sense because the
being Jeb is Bush over and saying John Ellis Bush I kind of want to start calling him Bush
honestly this whole time I was under the impression that his parents had cruelly named
him Jeb I did too oh my god oh my god oh my god it's not that they cruelly named him Jeb
it's that he incompetently calls himself Jeb can you imagine they had a board meeting and they
concluded that was the best way to mark it oh my goodness and you shall be Jeb how is it that
we're finding out about this now like well I just I just assumed that it just it wasn't like an
unreasonable name I could have because I've just seen I've seen that what's the movie with Christian
Bale plague yep no the guy who was with George Bush oh but I could have sworn Jeb was in that
like portrayed in that movie and they referred to him as Jeb just do you think this parent
would have called him Jeb oh it's like terrible like oh that's our that's our Jeb that's our
little Jeb growing up on the ranch what uh you don't have to ask these questions I just find it
funny what would your name be if it was just the initials of your name mine's the best yeah it
wouldn't make any sense mine would be cunty oh my god and for those who are like what the
fuck do you mean my initials would be C N T E so cunty can you either view up what up me or if I
got the winning vote there no mine is unpronounceable same with mine well I'll take the victory on that
I'm fine with it that's what I'll run on definitely win president cunty cunty at least I'll say it to
your face all right so John Ellis Jeb Bush in the 2016 United States United States election has been
uncovered by reporters working for the daily tism the lone supporter was interviewed anonymously to
uncover what alien mindset drove him to such a decision the results will shock you having
started by assuring his support had nothing to do with policy or leadership qualifications he
elaborated I mean the guy's own mom said on TV that he shouldn't get the post jeez did you see his
face I figured I don't know what's best for the country but maybe we could just help this poor guy
get his way for once new news studies indicate that insomnia serves as a great fuel for memes oh
there you go you did it hit it here first I'm assuming this is an Arlo meme SS leader Heinrich
cookie monster appears jovial as he is sworn in and reveals he enjoyed cooking is the origin of
this I have no idea it's probably the Arlo stream because he looks like cookie I mean that was my
guess but I always managed to bring up the Holocaust somehow all right we got us another
movie coming out the 12 long days of efab will premiere December 11th at a slow oh shit that's
already yeah came out four days ago hey what you got in that uh what you got in that that box for me
mauler can I just highlight a massive orgiginal production or G orgiginal orgiginal orgiginal
we're gonna we're gonna see if he really is the long man I mean proofs in the pudding as they
say wolf just casually in some pizza there oh I could go for some pizza now pizza would be good
so sounds pretty good it's not too late I shouldn't eat that much pizza though cuz I'm trying well
I've been I've been pretty good the last feed I might have a pizza I think this is a rendition of
diabetes oh just a couple pieces and then have the rest late I don't know diabetes oh he's got the
big D on his cake helmet he's got a dial he's feeding him insulin you guys like the diabetes
it was infinitely more popular than movie Bob will ever be yes such a legendary meme let's see
who the flute man really is it was massive J all along why would J have been the flute man
was the flute man wasn't he hmm conflucious wasn't that the flute guy yes they would be called
conclusion but why would it be J I like you in the corner of st. Kate J I don't even need
context exactly for this I just like it that's fucking horrifying oh my god what is this fresh
hell do you like how the memes come in all shapes and sizes there's nothing in terms of limitations
oh my goodness seasons greetings I took what did we say on the Arlo stream I've completely
forgotten I forget like I remember the stream but I don't think I remember anything relating
to like going to prison or genocide my memory clearly we fucked up because we had some strong
babes we forgot exactly what they were about chat probably knows that's some Avengers tisms
oh no this isn't Avengers this is this is crisis on infinite it's crisis on infinite jabs
we got jab diabetes Oh jab knee dawn jeb episode jab over jeb it's the end of the
claps dude look at the one where he's running oh beginning to fire a clap oh jay just said
apparently we made jokes about cookie monster committing genocide I honestly don't remember
you think that would be what I wouldn't forget but I apparently oh oh there's I don't even think
this is an efap me but it's a great beam you know there's there's that character it I didn't
actually know it existed until very recent there was another Yoda alien on the Jedi Council
yeah I didn't know that until like a couple weeks ago yeah she her kids a brother named
you know what their you know what their favorite hobby is fucking no yeah no Jesus fucking I was
gonna say yodeling I never I never said that they were fucking each other yodeling yodeling
sorry I was doing some push-ups of the closet real quick sorry all right well what about no
Anakin you can't be a Jedi master okay all right ironically we are like a third of the way through
picture means rags we really need to remember this shit everyone remembers cookie monster
genocide except for us very much out of the loop all right someone's saying the cookie monster meme
is a combination of Arlo and the Nick Fuentes cookie analogy okay that's triggering some memory
it's kind of all coming together yeah I don't want to cut in the line but oh wait what's that I
need as you walk down the street you hear a man's voice say you look prettier he smiled you turn
around and give him your widest grin revealing one-inch blood-stained fangs vampires call me
is that a reference vampires call me the dawn what is that at vampires call me the dawn we're
deciphering this chat go yeah what do we do chat assist I like that you just said
chat assist like it was a fucking order in a video game they do it they're good they know
what their shit is they have like a big old like they like Google oh someone sent me the
someone sent me the original of that picture and it's terrifying I've seen the original it's
terrifying why did someone draw that were they commissioned against their will possibly
wait to chat answer a question I don't know someone said wait wait wait splendor man would
be the nemesis of time you know he could potentially be like working with him you know
oh it's this dawn is fatal to vampires is he so that makes sense if he's a vampire hunter
and he's called the dawn wait why no because his name is dawn and dawn is deadly to vampires
why is dawn deadly to vampires because vampires can't be in the Sun mauler you watched vampire
drat count Dracula you know Dracula untold we watch Dracula untold you should be a vampire
expert why is the dawn the Sun no no no no no the da double yeah I was waiting for one of you two
to get it so I didn't look like a retard that's what they call a racism or sexism sorry gotta get
it right if someone's saying no the actor for the dawn is on blood and is a vampire wait why
don't vampires he is a vampire that's lame though really on one is way better build with self-hatred
I guess face when the leaks are real she's like terrified but also hungry ironically like wolf I
don't know if you've seen that stream yet or not but the leaks are insane I've seen some of the
leaks on like reddit but I haven't read all of them and I haven't seen the stream it like you
know it sounds hyperbolic but right like when we read those things doesn't it sound like someone
trying to destroy Star Wars it literally sounds like it's the most batshit insane convoluted fetch
quest across the galaxy that I've ever seen they have horses riding on top of Star Destroyers it's
the most insane thing wolf it's gonna be nuts I can't wait I can't wait to just use it as an
excuse to just never watch Star Wars again you gotta watch this though cuz it's insane well
yeah after this it's like I said it on Twitter already in the past dreams it's like I'm pretty
much done with Star Wars I'm not a fan that's not true though that's a lie because you gotta
watch you're gonna watch the Mandalorian no I'm not yeah you are I thought you said you'd already
started watching you said you not only you said you not you missed that you were going to start
watching it but that you were actually watching it at the moment yeah in the back remember you
told us about the Bill Burr comment and it annoyed us as well yeah you explained the Bill Burr joke
to us so we thought it was terribly told sure but even the point of the joke was terrible I
I just I really feel like you're I really feel like you're kind of letting us down yeah why why
start the Mandalorian not finish like why go halfway though I have to admit watching episodes
one three five and six is weird like why would you why what are you talking about I feel like I feel
like we can't rely on you yeah I guess we'll just move on the next picture meme okay Mandalorian alright
next meme your Buffy that Star Wars the efap that picture was good your sad wolf is that in that
get-together you can watch that video it's like I think it's a 20-year anniversary for Buffy Zander
isn't seen in any shot with all of them outside of I think Anya because all of them want to stay
away from him because he's crazy oh my god really yeah he like got into serious he got arrested
several times serious alcohol issues wait who it wouldn't you wouldn't know him he's just one of
the people in the picture it's just sad what how do you know I wouldn't know him maybe we met
I'm gonna bet 100 dollars on the fact that you do not know him I'm gonna oh yeah well I'll raise
you I'll bet 200 dollars that I don't okay I give up massive soft man that's rude that that really
disappoints me yeah I know it sucks you went on dr. Phil you can actually find it on YouTube it's
such a weird thing because I don't want Zander to be on dr. Phil I know I was like I remember
what I got told about I was like what the fuck is he on dr. Phil like what weird weird weird weird
things um he had like some really good shit I mean I like the character law it sucks I think
that Buffy was like his main consistent referring to him as Zander don't actually know his fucking
real name Nicholas Brendan oh raw the fuck you doing here it's night hey the sun is up somewhere
he just has to travel
have you guys got my stream up because yes look at the way that just filled the screen
McMuffin all right Jeb you know what's up
wait I'm trying to tell from the from the actual clip itself how much of that
is that a little bit of a delay on the stream is that all fake
like is the only original part of it just the closed mouth cuz wow
I see now that's funny
McMuffin McMuffin I'm only Liza Dusky wasn't there either that's true yeah oh oh I didn't
know the mouth moved mm-hmm of course the mouth moves
it's the mouthiest mouth that ever mouthed this is this is quite the meme you got bad
Joker takes most of your problems are caused because of a woman not not to not to take your
meds Joker hates black women bisexualism and then it's Bob's fault why bisexual
what's the origin of that I can't remember
so strange oh hey look it's the Titanic relevant to our stream six hours until the streaming cap
my god we'll never get through the super chats and then raw you massive
it's okay wolf I'll swim to New York okay well I'ma swim to New York
that's some good shit not to mention how long it would take to make this meme look at this you
gotta cow all the super chats place them all on top of each other cut my head out on top of you
good stuff good stuff that's really good cannot go without appreciating a good meme
tux on that tux off
it makes sense tux off is dead naming oh shit because has he cut his penis off yet I don't
think so but I think you can dead name without doing that it's not about the money it's about
sending whites to chambers oh my goodness oh my goodness he's on the stairs
just take the blur tool and just move it in a circle
that's like the laziest way of making a fat person I've ever seen
it's like smudge it's smudge they took a smudge tool is this no I'm pretty sure that's not that's
the uh the stamp tool is that where you no oh here like if you because if you use a large enough
smudge and you drag it out it only does it once every so far on the image like once every so far
for the pixels I'm saying we're talking it kind of looks like it I'm sure it's stamped not smudge
chat answer this is it stamp here I'll open gimp and I'll and I'll take a look how dare you refer
to me as a gimp I'll gimp you so I'll get a picture here right let me get one of my pictures
right let's drag that on the gimp and yeah the smudge tool so let's make the smudge tool
see I'm talking in terms of photoshop not this weird program that no one uses
plenty of people use gimp so okay I'll I'll print screen this this is what happens if you do it
I just did it for you jay said looks like smudge stamped smudge
smudge stamp smudge smudge stamp stamps we got oh we got some conflict here
okay well if you say well is it stamp studge smudge smudge stamp gimp it's not stamped rags
is thick I'm sorry I had to read that out rag I don't know if that's offensive I just had to
read it out it's true smamp gimp gigolo had to read that out too uh long gimp bad
stampy smudgy same thing oh my god could it be the same thing
but there I showed you an image as proof of the effect yes you're right it does kind of look like
it could have been done that way the way I would have if I was told to replicate this image I would
have used stamp um moving on however we've got um rags is missing on a rhino milk oh you can you
can change the rate and the flow so if I take the
I'm missing oh no I I I hope I find myself I think you're fired that's a really like it oh
this is the really cool image that we've talked about before I think it's so you got yeah you got
uh Wilford Brimley who famously says da we just and with the x you've got it at first you might
think it's the same guy but in the x is diabeto they fit together so well
it's a really good picture wow that's actually crazy they really do their faces are that that's
almost like the same person and I will say this diet diet bob diabe bob diabeto has a better
mustache than Wilford Brimley in tins of grooming by the looks of this picture just saying just
saying like rags what do you think is Wilford Brimley still alive that's the common question
people ask yes he is red letter media often are shocked by this because he was an old man
like 30 years ago and he's still Wilford Brimley is 85 he is currently alive I can't believe that
he's alive but he's got all right yes how guess how tall Wilford Brimley is seven foot one
whoa I'm guessing five four really yeah he's five eight so I was a short man yeah he's not
a very tall man woohoo he's shorter than me he's a wide man though oh wait when it says
it always surprises me that he was in the thing I'm always like shit man he was in the thing
he's still taller than Tom Cruise
oh hey man Tom Cruise is in some good ass movies like mission is five seven
Tom Cruise is a short man he is a short man how tall are you rags how what how tall are you
how tall am I oh god here we go yes I don't I don't I don't know I kind of I don't know I'm

Fringy sways in the wind when there's a song well he's 6 5 I am 6 4 so me and Fringy would be long
how are you so tall too what 6 foot 2 what is in the water in welshland wherever you're from

oh my goodness everyone's like rags as a man like like no I'm 5 10 that's that's not short you know
how it works women say anything below six foot automatically disqualifies you average male height
five feet nine inches I am one inch above average hey that's what that's what Jeremy says about his
penis above average penis I haven't above average penis hmm that's where it matters yeah fuck the
average he's like well there's a lot bigger than average manlets btfo that's disgusting
jay how tall are you are we all taller than our manager oh yeah by the way I just want to clarify
I can't extend myself to thousands of feet if at will obviously destiny is 5 8
you have to bring that up I just thought of short people and he came to mind
what are you sure people are shortens how could you say it like that that's so offensive
jay how tall are you should we all put bets on it before you reveal it I gotta guess 410
oh he's six six foot oh his birthday's not ago he's lying jay honestly I would have guessed
five foot jay you are not yeah but you're like a lanky six feet you you're yeah dude if he's six
foot he's gonna put rocks in your pockets when it's windy outside so you don't blow away
I feel like you could like punch him and you would break it off
you're like um he's like Gumby where he's really thin but he's tall
y'all y'all og's in the chat remember Gumby
am I the only motherfucker here he's talking about Gumby and everyone else is quiet because
they don't remember Gumby I don't know who the fuck you're talking about you don't know about
Gumby no it sounds like something you just made up no it isn't yeah y'all know about Gumby
but Gumby was a real thing he had a horse for a friend
oh oh my god poor Gumby dude I actually remember this this is it because a dude dressed up as
this for his dog and his dog went crazy
poor Gumby
this is from like the 50s and 60s fuck your old rags I don't know
no I'm not an old man like 70 years old I guess
I just need people
thank you so person to chat thank you Rommo Greywolf how could someone said I legit live
under a rock because I don't know what Gumby is how could you say that when Jay is here
Gumby's made out of clay that's like his thing jumbo jumbo is clay why is it was a tv show a
clay character how many of those were there oh stop motion was great did I miss stop motion
either of you guys see Coraline I never finished it that's good shit that's good shit
anyway yes it's true that Jenny Nixon being a tism doesn't really alert us but Jeb Bush
man that is straight to our hearts good meme
so this was someone submitted a meme where they had the thing with a cow that was like super thin
and we were milking it for Batwoman and we corrected them saying that Batwoman is like
an infinite source of milk and so they corrected the meme it's much more accurate now
they even added the cow or well what what do you call that a cow a maid I don't know
I really like how the guy is the efap colors yes the colors have spread to his arm and back
I don't I don't know see the animu ones I'm lost so you got movie bob I I fire a blast at him and
he explodes I don't know what what this is what animu is could it be pokemon slash something
completely different it could be pokemon or digimon digimon is it digimon digital monsters
oh they had the better theme but they just sucked
it's a pretty controversial take there I mean it's a it's a worthless take because I never
watched it I just knew the theme no I know it was worthless okay but I said it was worthless
before you did so you can't just say that I'm gonna distance myself I'm glad that on my screen
wolf is in between us because I don't wouldn't I wouldn't want to be staying well on my screen
you're right next to me buddy so would you say well I shouldn't be what's up with digimon huh
what's happening with digimon oh man thinking though who think of the digimon had a better theme
song than pokemon is that controversial really that is how it was more catchy okay more catchy
sing it you just did this the did it did it did it did it did it yeah that's catchy
not like you're like the x-men tv show as first off it's not catchy people haven't heard that
song and you are that's racist wolf back me up how racist he's being wolf no explain to mauler
that the digimon theme song is it nearly as good as the pokemon theme song I want to be the very
best no one ever come on I said catchy okay I'm clarifying that it's catchy not necessarily
better but I know theme songs oh do you know the theme song of pokemon or digimon you don't
know the theme song of pokemon you don't you know the theme song of pokemon who doesn't know that
I don't even I didn't even know digimon existed until just now what
gotta catch them all you know digimon was like hey we're cool too but they weren't
belch no I I wasn't aware only fucking damn it there was me thinking everyone knew about
pokemon and digimon I've been living in a different world
I like this meme it's so accurate
oh yeah that is true
I've told it's baby Yoda is still the most consistent character of Mandalorian
just saying put it out there what's the consistent character of Disney Star Wars
yes what about k2so
oh yeah k2so was pretty good it's k2so and baby Yoda best characters of Disney Star Wars
huh
just like the mickey d just said what are you people
I think that's in relation to the digimon conversation I like this meme by the way
you know the guy is sweating like baby yum word
how do you pitch efap to anyone ever what what does one do it would have to be a compilation
so this is kind of terrifying in a way just for the style I don't really know what's happening
I just got sent it okay
in jeb we trust oh my god you're reading lord of the rings I got that
what was this made with crayon digital
it's like digital this I could smell this picture
oh it smells like play-doh
oh I know what you mean I know that smell yes I know that smell yeah man I was gonna say why
like you know that that friend you go over to their house so you just like every time you
walk in you're like you wrinkle your nose and you're like why does my friend smell so weird
what's what's rags up to but the bomb there what's he doing
I'm clearly sick from all the play-doh I've ingested I thought it was I don't oh my goodness
oh this is all right I guess we'll have to sink
kind of this is this is a reddit post you guys have to click this to open it up and it's a video
okay um boy oh yeah okay wow look at this so you guys at zero hold on it's uh okay
turn my volume on all right ready all right I'm there three two one go
got wolf and me just I'm just having a dance as you do who's in the picture
I don't know I don't think it's that complicated I think this is sims and it's just me and you
I don't know if there's a rags here oh god where am I going you're probably going to eat some pizza
yeah fuck man I'm really into this song that's all right
that's a proper elevator too this is my jam yo oh yes I'm into this
see wolf thinks I've like died or something he's probably I'm probably in the back
trying to find an argument yeah I'm winning an argument oh my goodness sped up sped up a little
bit yeah I haven't played sims in so long I've never played sims no oh have you played sim francs
I have not no damn I live it I live it every day no I played sims on the ds one of the comments says
this is satanic that makes sense played um what was it called um
um oh the sims 2 on the ds it was the alien what a strange platform to play it on was it good
yeah I don't I can't tell maybe I was just I mean I enjoyed it but I was young so I might
have just been stupid I I think it wasn't good but I found some strange bestial attraction to
it and this most surface level because you could make little songs and one of the songs was called
disco blitzkrieg and you could make all the things happen and you just reminded me that guitar hero
was on ds I had rock band unplugged on the psp the sims now I kind of wanted out sims 2 ds uh music
all right but next meme uh episode 52 I think this is when we were covering the closer look
because it says epic epic epic epic my advert senses are tingling you know my my my fingers
seem to be morphing in with my nose but I'm okay with this it's having a big thong this is um I feel
like we should have shown this already if we didn't uh if we did already oh well but it's um
it's the pixel rendition of the bulb episode we've even got jay longbone riding rags
why are you jealous of jay longbone
man this is like a trip down memory fucking lane I don't even know what I'm dealing with right now
what is this uh I hereby announce that you are objectively a husband and wife and I'm marrying
egg you look like an alien I'm okay with that I'm confused about who I'm marrying
um it looks like an egg in one of those russian dolls what are they called like petrovshka dolls
petrovshka uh russian doll
they're called ryoshka doll matryoshka doll
shinoble dolls also also known as babushka dolls oh yeah
ooh
looking very fine if I may say
oh
I think diabetes should get his movie that's my opinion
access to tbs.twin.com was denied
I can't that link leads me to a place that I've been denied apparently no dogs allowed on tbs.twin.com
wolf you know the x-men cartoon tv show theme right that's all right just ignore my
no rags you know it right the x-men tv show theme yeah um yeah I think so do it
I'm trying to give me a second because I remember there like wasn't like
oh then the one there part that went like
it's the one that goes
yes yes I do
I might have been confusing it with the spider-man uh song
oh man that show was fun I remember watching that shit
but the only thing I know about the the tv show is a clip I saw where um someone takes down magneto
with a wooden gun and he's like how did you take me down and he explains that the gun is wooden and
it's like magneto why don't you just kill all of them now then
yes people are saying that spider-man yeah I went to the youtube and um you tried to cheat
then you failed no no it wasn't cheating it's like these are these are shows that I haven't
seen in many many many oh you haven't seen it in a while so that means you don't remember it quite
clearly that's that's an excuse both of them that's an excuse and even even when I even when
I hummed it I said I think that might actually order uh pokemon digimon x-men spider-man those
four themes from bestoist um pokemon is number one all right followed by spider-man then x-men
then digimon so I'm gonna I'm just gonna say x-men beats them all that fucking theme is fantastic
it was good then um I love the pokemon theme but I found digimon to be more catchy that is my
position I stand by it oh so you think that syphilis is a better disease than cancer because
it's more catchy well that's a complicated discussion because what makes the better disease
the one that is more catchy or the one that is uh whatever the other thing was pretty sure
I asked you that based on what you said was your disease that is more catchy be the better one
no it is the superior does that I'm not saying it's good morally so the best disease is the one
that knocks out and kills itself immediately yeah the best disease is disease because the
disease that doesn't exist at all I feel they're like communists the only good communist is a dead
communist communists can spread like a sexual disease if you can't spread like a fucking
sexual disease yeah everyone's like oh you feel like it's bad like listen I think that spider-man
and x-men I think they're both really good I really like them this is just subjectively
me ranking them I know that digimon's at the bottom oh people some people are putting digimon
right at the top oh it's all right if people are wrong in chat how can chat be wrong it's always
right and it always has a unified opinion there's never any difference look everybody's agreeing
on the exact same thing there's no difference spooter play the pokeball theme okay so that was
we we totally oh I don't even know what to make of this I guess it was human scooby and then we
look at human rags based on rags as doggo I understand this yeah not bad rags excuse me rags
oh yeah fucking I got that I got um I'm I have a quite the quite the physique
is it curious scooby versus the chad rags so this is uh shad this is the great emu king with
tiger snake arms this is a this is a photo realistic image uh he did indeed commit to
this battle and won the place he fought him in was the the zone of black and white
yeah pretty crazy emus with tiger snake arms I don't want anyone to say that's not real it's
very real uh next up we got look at women so majorly absolutely destroying this argument
the straw man says I wasn't making a particularly good point anyway
as if the straw man just wants to die it's like oh well
that was the uh the plague creations uh video where he like beats the shit out of the straw
about rule just like hey how you doing we're over here if you want to hang out
surprising how much the straw man has become useful in explaining positions
oh the straw man this is the nuke sword very good this was uh the arlo stream in which
what would it look like to have a nuke sword that looks pretty good for would that be dangerous
like would it affect you or do you have new community with the nuke sword would be dangerous
well I could see the radioactive fumes yeah but if I'm assuming you're immune to anything
that comes from the nuke sword yourself like because you're the user I don't know that's my
opinion yeah I don't know I feel like just my body in general isn't isn't you know we radiation
and I we don't get along that well someone put Elsa Jean in chat and so I've been looking up Elsa
Jean pictures and uh she's uh she's a she's a lovely lady was Elsa Jean Elsa Elsa's frozen
star oh okay yeah she's got some she's a pretty good looking got some nice tits what was the
video we covered where the person said they love rocks love rocks mm-hmm I don't know I think it
might have been the video from um the potential like the potential subjective uh rating of the
film is based on how many rocks there are I think that's what there might be
I think and then we said that you could actually get an objectively pretty strong game that was
all about collecting rocks and it was all accurate so like how rocks work and then like categorized
into very specific high high detailed systems of rocks uh like death stranding but with rocks
so here's the thing chat you say don't mock him for not knowing who Elsa Jean is I didn't know
who Elsa Jean is I don't know porn stars by name I didn't feel by ranks I felt no the chat so I
was like yeah right mauler you don't know like I don't know the name porn stars like I don't
I'm like I don't I don't specifically look and follow their careers like oh a lot of work tits
look today he's like no I just I just go to porn do you remember captain man oh no that's right I'm
a furry I only look at furry porn and I know all the characters names and I'll read all the comics
and I make sure that my porn furry porn lore is up to date and I always use the right pronouns
ranks do you remember do you remember captain manpower
oh my goodness totally masculine crazy opposite feminist hero who I believe we said he throws
meat at people he has like power drills attached he has a barbecue attached to his back I believe
fucking don't mess with captain manpower oh my god I forgot about this
I believe this is original artwork as well it is with the Isle of Man flag yep
that's what gives away see if ever you guys make like original artwork that's amazing you
gotta make sure we can tell because I for a second thought like oh this must be like
some image of a Nazi vision of several like the Muppets but that gives it away the Isle of Man
flag there's some there's some good rat right there so this is very good I believe this is us
trying to assault the the the entity that is uh movie bob I appreciate that he's wearing a bra
that's actually very thoughtful of him but uh he's throwing meat at us we're trying to assault
this creature I don't think he he it's almost it's weird because he is like a meat volcano
uh-huh uh-huh and he's throwing yeah it's pretty terrifying to say the least uh this is meat and
not shit well it's got bones sticking out of it you're just you're oh my god what are you eating
this is no I just didn't see the bones I'm gonna forget because he just
oh what a disgusting human that's your opinion that's not based on any kind of standard
just some any image here more with uh with that infinity gauntlet and on the gas mask portion I
believe it says like one x meaning nine and three ninety three that would be the name I usually went
by good shit good details it was a cool one I like the yeah I like that nine and three molar nine
ninety nine and three molar is nine three I like this
oh that is cool oh you drove
the size it is oh I was supposed to show the gift fist wait mix a gift oh there's a gift
I believe so sorry I'm looking oh it's tough to know Elsa Jean right here so if you click this
or at least play this I think you get a you get a video it's like
wait let me go back to the beginning it's when an obstacle seems insurmountable
uh just remember they survived the movie
hey mostly it looks really good I like that how it's different angles on it
but it's really good another rendition really animated with his you know arms up like that
it's like a gelatinous cube he's very attractive in the jelly world I believe yeah in the jelly
world he's less nasty looking in the jelly world he's very welcome do you see
it oh this was so if you remember Rags we uh we covered a mr Stuckman's video
and he said that like he had the characters lament upon the idea of a rolling pin enemy
that would how ridiculous that would be someone created the idea of Jerry the rolling
cherry oh my goodness it's not impossible guys all right you know what a good last name would be
for him Springer Baker Cherry Baker because this is using a rolling pin as a weapon I you know what
I gathered that I got it yeah so his last name could be Baker the uncanny efap you got wolf as
Rorschach uh oh look we've got the musicians there flute musician wait a second jay log mode
can shoot lasers out of her eyes why are you cyclops
two cyclops on the team
wait so that Star Wars guild is mr bad hat and then are my oh no mystique
I guess mystique I'm Wolverine and Diabeto is of course throwing jelly cubes at us
wolf your hat looks like it's smug
huh looks like your hat is smiling smugly
how you see the eyes in the little mouth uh I don't know the mouth is supposed to be
the thing in the middle that oh the thing I don't know what you're talking about
I'll show you I'll show you here like I highlight it rags you can do it here
I see the eyes I don't get the smug smile part it's the fucking thing in the middle
he writes post together the red box around the mouth no I know what you
I know what you think the mouth is I just don't see how I know the mouth is
I understand what's the smug part of it though that's the expression that is
what isn't the smug part of it it just looks like two eyes and a comma
it's like it's like a smug anime face
that doesn't look anything like that does fringy fringy back me up what what no fringy's on my side
fringy what the context is this fringy you agree with me right fringy fringy you agree with me on
this come on and and me wolf is the odd man out true no he's gay what what's this story
what are you doing help me out I can't all right so in the image that says do you see the uncanny
efap image yes okay look at wolf's hat yeah uh yeah doesn't it look like a smug face
um I don't know it looks like a trilby that's that's all I could say yeah I know I know I know
what it is but who is the hat and I'm thinking a smug anime face you think the hat has not even
an anime face just a smug face I mean I guess I can see two eyes there yeah one of them is consulted
at a 45 degree angle a little bit and the other one's sort of flat which gives it a little bit
of a crazy look more so than anything um I don't know what to make of the shadow at the bottom though
that's what's throwing me off it looks like a comma it does look like a comma does it look like a
comma or does it look like an impostor I don't know it looks like a comma I I mean I haven't
seen this picture before so I was a little bit distracted by the man teddy on underneath the
donut there you want to know why because it's up high it's on his hat it's up high and
apostrophes are up high yeah but it's like below the eyes if it was above the eyes I think I might
agree with you there but why would a smile be above the eyes ringy no but it's it's I don't
even I'm not even conceited that it is a smile at this point it doesn't look anything like a smile
yeah yeah I think I'm on both sides of this one yeah I'm using my judgment to tell me wrong
maybe if you're used to mouths being flipped uh like that's art that's art and art is subjective
entirely entirely entirely 100 there's literally no way okay yeah that's what we're about that's
what the efap podcast is about so you're willing to accept his eyes but no mouth am I am I getting
that right well I mean I'm not really willing to accept anything to be honest with you this picture
definitely looks like it's a smug face I show show this picture mauler show show this pick the one
here the one that we talked about why don't you post that to chat oh they I put it on full fucking
screen they can see it every single one of them agrees it's a smile there's not a single person
who doesn't it looks like a smug face yeah let's see someone just posted the smug face
how how is that not that exactly well I don't know what this hold on look at that chat thank
you chat you glorious absolutely you know what's up chat I love you yeah if the smile was tilted 45
degrees it doesn't yeah it doesn't it doesn't look like the smut face at all you're just it
doesn't look like it at all come on are you shitting me it doesn't look like it it's the
first thought is like look at how far up the mouth is tilting it's like he's been in a car crash
it does not resemble it in its entirety
yeah that's a pretty impressive that's that's that's uh that's that's what you sound like
right now people are posting the uh the what are you fucking what do you call them
quotation marks with the slash that looks more like it I didn't look like it that don't look
the same rags I don't know what to tell you okay no no no hold on fucking moving
hold on this is what it looks like it definitely looks like it no close here I'll make you your link
or anger or anger or whatever this stream is never going to end for me that's okay
what the hell we've still got nine hours remaining so we're fine
see chat why are you taking a piss or do you mean that no we already have nine hours remaining
see oh okay at it
you just keep saying like oh look at it it's definitely that why would why would rags need
to say anything else when it comes to the truth quite frankly now let's move along before let's
move along before wolf baron I'm I'm okay with moving along if you wish I bet wolf that I bet
hey wolf is a hat uh clothing or an accessory wolf that's the question okay hold on I'm gonna
need your definition on accessory in this I'm gonna need you to answer the question
question you call it I don't I can't answer the question if I'm not really certain how to define
accessory in relation to clothing uh because but my first thought is accessory but I don't know if
I'm right what what fringy is a hat clothing or an accessory I don't know what I don't know what
the definition of clothes is I like I don't want to tell you like in definitions oh I gotta
according to wikipedia a hat is a head covering so I'm gonna go ahead and say that yes as opposed
to a foot covering I guess okay okay so accessory the definition of accessory is a thing that can
be added to something else in order to make it more useful personal to make it more useful
versatile or attractive oh so really all clothes are accessories then because no clothes are clothes
and accessories are based on that definition that's not true it's fashion accessory it's
right under here on the wikipedia for fashion access yeah yeah fashion accessory what other
accessory would it be it could behave super different accessories it doesn't even say it's
clothes is a watch yes it does it literally says where is the outfit as types and it has
watches here and canes how is a cane a clothing what do you mean cane is a clothing
cane is not a clothing well maybe maybe it is who knows no how can you wear like clothes
cats and dogs i'm living with each other on an expedition this cane will keep me warm from the
elements yeah it will because i'll spin it around really fast spin this little ring around my
finger that i'm spinning it with it's keeping free if you spin the cane around really fast
that'll just create a fan it will fly away and you're like i'm hotter now
yeah because you're getting closer to the sun
what if it's night time and you're flying toward the abyss of space
well i mean i don't know what to tell you man like you guys aren't there hey listen
you can survive to live in space like layer yeah that's the acumen chain
use the force spin the cane really fast hold your breath for like 10 years and get to the
moon that's no what what have i what have i arrived in yeah wolf look everyone did you know
that the surface temperature of the moon on like the bright side is actually really hot i'm gonna
even confirm that that's your opinion why don't you just use the cane to fly to the nearest
store that has yeah this is what it says temperatures can reach 127 real degrees
so i was right fuck you guys yeah the sun okay wait the sun does exist at night but if you're
flying up at night time you're not hiding toward the sun exist at night well it depends no it does
depend on shit if it's nighttime and you're flying up you're not flying toward the sun no no no no if
you if it's nighttime then you use like earth's gravity as a slingshot to get to the sun what the
fuck that's what do you mean what that's like basically okay this is this is you are you're not
a scientist i'm not gonna take this seriously i don't know what to tell you man it's scientists
use mr you get hotter when you go to the sun but what if it's nighttime you're not going to the
sun at all are you what do you mean you're not going to the sun going to these guys are acting
oh my god did you just put something that says it's surprisingly hard to go to the sun
no this is nasa this is nasa saying nasa said it's not easy to go to the sun
really that's not say it's because are you people telling me the sun exists at night i know
we know that is not up for that we we all agree on efap that the sun does indeed exist at night
it does not mean if you fly up at any position or across the planet you end up with the sun that's
a big sense no no you see the sun phases out of existence when the lights turn off this is basic
science well no if you subscribe to the whole simulation theory then i guess the sun oh we're
all in the matrix but even in the matrix will they had a sun i'm just asking questions all right
they had a sun in the matrix even if it's a simulation the planet still spins in that
simulation like there are people yeah another matrix the machine's blocked out the sun the
galaxy brain to the conversation we'll get to the bottom of things what did ocean man say about the
sun ocean man he needed the tides so he needed the moon fuck the sun what the fuck did this
conversation start how do we look all this important is fringy did agree that it does look
like a smirk face okay we're good it literally does there's a picture on imger and it's it's there
for everyone to see and i i don't say i don't know say it looks like the smirk face it looks like
the smirk face if it was put in like a cap if you know when they make patterns in your coffee
it looks like the smirk face was put in your coffee and then let to like sit for like exactly
nailed it that's three to two three no no no i'm not saying it does look like the smirk face
it looks like someone put the smirk face in liquid and this is the distorted again this is
this is the distorted like you know version of it after 30 minutes after it's been distorted
i have instead it looks like someone from a country that doesn't exist who agrees with me
and someone who's not actually six so he's a confirmed liar if anything this hurts your case
i was gonna say you said he came from a made-up universe that means he's not even real hey look
there's two liars on my team and if you have two liars they cancel each other one big truth
no it means that's still only one vote for yes so you just took away a yes for you no
because it's a double player together then it's like four one times one is one that's true that's
true that is true rags knows what he's talking about here he's right oh yeah well if you multiply
our votes together one times one is one so huh yep oh i'm sorry i i thought you realized i was
joking but it sounds like very serious this is the time for joking nope what i get the whole
oh okay serious business how do you think we're just gonna of course when you start to lose it's
a joke you think nine hours into a stream we're gonna start joking is that what you think i get
to be so sleep deprived to go into this fucking funeral hey should we move on to the next one
yes unironically this is pretty awesome it's from stratumire i think it's from stratumire let me
stratumire so it would whoa no cid nicolson sorry cid nicolson he's he's another talented
artist so he's got this is completely original he got diabetes he's consuming a burger a hot dog
several tortilla chips with cheese and peppers donut donut donut donut donut donut donut and then
you got toxic brood comics back there so he's he's in his basement apartment not a basement
is he manning a drone there he's targeting a quite he's typing he's got you now motherfucker
marble gold out don't forget to take out the garbage oh fired and he thunks it into the
fucking garbage can there's even you can see there's a there's an eaten apple and a and a soda
of maybe a milkshake in it the elevator music is still running oh
oh god forbid i think many people think that this is 100 serious that would be terrible
he's also got a little keychain that has tlj on it
i like that um the belt is struggling to retain the fat as it rolls over the sides
i like his tricycle yeah and so this is the opening of him defeating professor exercise who
is obviously going to be quite the season finale if you will
so this meme i know i showed you guys this because i loved it but the the origin of this
meme was me saying that um the guy we covered who said that um every youtube show has to be pitched
to a producer before it can be made i said i was pitching efap to these youtube executives
why are the executives me and er well because you became a manager you were like yeah i'm gonna
invest oh yeah yeah i'm gonna invest there's the right er though you know er i guess er approved
of it you just didn't want to you know become a manager that's that's a fair choice i think
who's the third one i don't know we got five five brains here and and chat who is the fifth guy
wait five brains and chat well chat's like 17 brains all in one i think that might be susan
oh susan wouldn't have approved of efap
well it came down to a vote and two out of the three voted yes not just your opinion
vote yes to efap but yes i like this image it amuses vote yes for efap's independence we got
see before the streams before the stream inside we had rhino milk the don and spider oracles were
all there to begin with two of which were memes that were created quote unquote by the manager
but it looks like i created them in my blackboard whiteboard uh presentation jay what do you have to
say i mean you guys know that i mean i mean people know that this is all like acting right
none of this is all staged this is all what they call exactly none of all this is staged
i agree no it's all staged so this is i believe sid nicholson once again is the cover of a new
comic uh fuck i'm hot you got a tism the titans of intergalactic space magic from the efap fanatical
universe the stamp says i've been hacked titans of intergalactic space and ironically this is a
great comic cover yeah that's a really cool cover the return of wolf and you even got a qr code
just in case you guys want to do whatever that does i i mean what are qr codes on comics tend to do
they're on hold on they probably is these days yeah someone needs to look that up because that
might be a thing no let me check myself uh i got a whole bunch of barcodes qr code can someone scan
that qr code to see what it is why can't i scroll over oh is this as far as it goes where's the qr
scan your qr code i'm trying to get it on screen there it is i got a qr scanner hold on
oh it says sid nicholson.com hey that's cool he's a good man he made he made the splash
oh he was fucking fantabulous yesterday i found out that there's a porn site called black tism
well um let's take a look that's your immediate reaction black tism.com black tism
um uh
it says black conservative intellectuals in modern america oh god really
oh because of conservatism is why it's showing up oh oh for me it's just monster black cocks for
cute white teens coming from you it's
so sorry
manager you're not supposed to say such things oh i can say whatever one choose to say true
oh and this is like a um what is this is this reference is a specific animu but me being so
uneducated i don't actually know which animu you guys are animu-ish like jojo or something i think
that's a mother fucking jojo reference jojo it is but yeah pretty fantastic i love it
um if i was to appear in an anime i'm okay with this being the rendition
they went with black tism
well i didn't get it hey you want to be original maybe it waits the results based on stuff that
you normally watch which is why if you actually would you actually get like do you actually get
like this is the url is this where you went and got like conservatism stuff no oh wow
conservatism i'm not clicking that for the stream just fyi like enter for videos i mean yeah you
probably shouldn't as probably knows what will happen i don't even want to click it on my computer
there's only one black penis on the screen oh only one all right don't click it no i won't
yeah i'm not that risque as they say risque riz gay also that actually does it for the first
portion of efap images how do you guys feel oh god that's just the first portion the first portion
how many portions are there three i like it how when when mauler says oh i don't know what anime
that is chat's like oh it's this what it's this what it's this what it knows exactly what it is
well yeah because our audience is filled with weaves like do you you knew this
oh and so begins the the meme of the next portion ryan brought them together now it's up to them
efap versus the legion of videos oh there's someone i was gonna say but i can't say yet
i can say to you guys off stream i should have said that there's something interesting i want
to tell you all you're gonna have to remind me i just say it really just say it really quiet i
don't think that'll work because it'll still be live just just type in the discord chat no no
just just like a whisper well no because i don't want to risk you saying it and then
i betray the confidence of someone else all right okay oh fine fine fine break it up into parts and
send each one of us one of the words and then we'll no no regs don't do the plot of arrival
just tell us what it is this is the plot of arrival this is the plot of the funniest joke
arrival was great no i destroyed in that debate damn wolf how do you feel
that sums it up hey a.m. one bowler it comes with memes a critique of force wakers every favorite
pause a critique of the last jedi meme meme i i'm not against this but oh uh did i have wolf not wolf
rags on there like you know like a lady that they paint on the on the plane oh yeah oh yeah that's
truly i love it that's great it's on the second image behind the uh the propeller oh yeah okay very
cute genuinely as springy j thank goodness you guys are here so you can actually share how good
this meme is
see that's so i don't know that i've ever seen that joke be made and this is what i want to
reference as like clever jokes for rick and mordy then people like oh yeah you have to be smart to
get it it's like i don't know i just think that it's clever like your booze me nothing because
i've seen what makes you cheer that's good shit i'm making a video on this right now trying to
justify it now and that's why i'm i'm procrastinating it by being on ether we'd be getting
very annoyed at the bad rick and morty takes like oh rick and morty's not that good rick and morty
tells you that bad people are good i saw i've seen the worst rick and morty take ever it's from
renegade cut oh no i sent free i sent this no i didn't wait i've been recommended i said um
free i sent you a message like yesterday saying you want to see the worst video on the internet
oh boy i saw the rick and morty thing where they had all the sex dragons and it was funny
it is funny attention citizens of drag on a slut dragon has escaped
unironically rags i would i would watch all of it with you at a day just because of how easy it is
to binge that show and just just just it'll be fun just to get you in on the means good thing to
do some afternoon i'd i'd i'd be down for that because that's the thing like i haven't seen any
rick and morty yet except really how long does it take to watch the whole show at this point is it
literally like like it's like three hours yeah it's really not a lot of season basically so it's
probably like very quick and very fun hmm oh yeah i mean i watched it all like preparing for uh did
i imagine i'm making a video um i watched it all preparing for that and it took me like we all
make it was like half a day at most well are you gonna defend rick and morty from the people who
say that rick and morty are advocating for bad people actually i'm just gonna make a video
talking about why it's good i'm not i'm not responding to i'm gonna throw any shade huh
because you don't risk it i might i might um pop in a clip from that quinton video
oh where he's the cool video was really bad he basically said that the show espouses that
rick's viewpoint is the viewpoint that you should adopt and his proof of this was playing rick's
clips over and over again it's like yeah and not playing like morty's clips or any other clips
contradicting rick because if rick says it it means it's true do you mean to tell me that
quinton is disingenuous no no no i think he believed what he said yeah that makes it worse
that makes my favorite one was when he's you guys know the unity episode right um oh yeah that's
right yeah yeah yeah this was this was great right so in the unity episode the whole thing is that
like summer and to a lesser extent morty wanna like free the citizens of the planet that have
been subsumed by the hive mind um and when they do they find out they're all a bunch of racists
for a for a wolf and rags right the context is this this creature that is essentially like you
know like children of the corn like it takes over your body and makes you like clones you into a
point where you you no longer have any free will corn yeah i don't okay maybe you don't know what
that is like body snatches yeah that's yeah there you go borg you know that right nebraska
horror film fucking so it makes this you have no free will and you basically become a part of a
collective okay okay so yeah go on yeah yeah so basically the collective um has taken over the
planet summer and morty like kind of want to free them and when they do they find out that the
people are actually a bunch of racists and a race war starts um and then and then like they get
rescued um and summer says something along the lines of i didn't realize freedom meant people
doing things that sucked and it's like that's a really that's a really funny word right but like
quinton's interpretation of that what what was it that he what was quinton's interpretation
was that that was the message of the episode that freedom is bad
because it means that people do stuff that sucks
it's like the most retarded sifs level take ever yeah i've saved the video and my whole thing is
if i force rags to watch all of rick and morty we will cover that video it'll be great i wouldn't
mind watching rick and morty i've heard good things about it it well that's the problem is
the the fan base will convince people it's like oh that's bullshit it's like no it's really not
it's a really good show and i mean dan harman seems to always be involved in really good shows
that's the thing yes i i hear about the the the pickle rick thing yeah yeah that's a
weaker episode yeah it's not it's a good episode just the pickle shit is i do like it but i think
it's i like all the therapy the therapy at the end ties it together really nicely it's a good
episode with a cool like but um i think i think that uh season three is a real mixed bag
person and not rick mixed bag and that there are any bad episodes like they're all good it's just
that i always felt like the season three finale left me confused like it being about the president
you know you know i mean you guys have seen it yeah yeah i remember being like that's the finale
okay i know that the premiere was really strong um the the wasteland episode i wasn't a big fan of
we should i was gonna say we should probably go back to memes because rags and rags and wolves
have no fucking clue what we're talking about the only reason you're expected to be a big finale
is because of season two in season one the last episode of the season was just then having a party
and that was it that was a good finale i thought it was quite explosive yeah it was a good episode
but like well i guess the thing is it's it's has to do with like the tone of each season
it's something that the the writers seem to be aware of season one was loose you know fun classic
rick and mordy adventures as fast as mordy said you know fun classic you know rick and mordy
adventures and then seasons again rick and mordy is some good shit honestly um season four is
amazing um season four has been really so this is a reference to quinton putting out a tweet saying
that um if you you should ignore efap because they treat the people they disagree with as their
personal nemesis i'm like i don't even know who you are um but yeah several people involved in that
i suppose um now i'm gonna just gonna start posting memes and we figure them out as we go
i um
um oh my god so that's from asdfmovie yes it is from asdf don't say asdf that's gay
no that's how tom pronounces yes he's the creator why would he matter when it comes to it are you
guys gonna cite that we should call it gif instead of gif i'm ready to respond theory
gif instead of gif you guys gonna go there do you want to go there go there
the transition is it's the paratext that is metatextual of you to say oh you should watch
rena did cut to find out paratext so there's metatext paratext is context added by the author
that's not in the actual text does it help you survive uh falling from a plane what what
oh because wait paragliding oh parag no parachute oh wait no paragliding applies right you can paraglide
out of a plane i suppose i guess you could jump from a moving plane and paragliding that sounds
like fun let's do that it's just weird that you would think of that instead of paragliding before
i'll attach a thousand parakeets to my arms
i want to play the alien game with like a roster of eight people who are taking it very seriously
just to see how it goes that would be fun i like the repurposed h and n i love this
fortier's tismy drawing of like a marge simpson alien has like spread through all of the memes
oh that's wonderful
we got the she she crashes the ship on arc two she's got this stupid
uchi dagger everything is proceeding inside of the scene
oh it's gonna be horrible oh excitement oh as if it was gonna be good
so this is referencing how sargon came onto efap and it died
um oh so you guys know the meme the cartoon where it says like some guy's enjoying sports
and then some guy goes hey sports are gay because blah blah blah and then he goes shush let people
enjoy things look we got the reverse shush let people engage in constructive criticism
yay we did it
just let people enjoy stuff this is applicable because we're currently we we stopped at six
and a half hours we're currently at three and a half hours we're at nine ten hours nearly
with plenty to go i can read that double the link
please
my favorite thing is like anyone who doesn't know what efap is reading this
how about you actually engage in conversation with me no i don't think
oh shit this would be the uh this is this so we covered this actually for me star wars has
actually been going downhill for years culminating with the unholy apocalypse that is the last jedi
tonaled disproves of the last jedi uh yeah free tonal actually made a good video yeah
unironically he made a good video oh wow like watch his new song woke star wars
there's a couple of hiccups but overall it's actually a pretty strong video for the length
we think he may have been watching efap and he's just taking notes
oh that's you see what i mean that's good that's good i seriously doubt that that's the case but
hey i like to think about it that way no you never know people will you don't never know
you know that
we're gonna have to explain this so the fact that it's only half
so okay fringy jay all right the first video from from from tonal we watched was his channel trailer
for his second channel he spends the first minute explaining that this is the channel he will upload
his low standard content which is pretty funny on its own but we move on and the video almost
seems like it's gonna end you know you're like oh this is the natural end he's like no he starts
talking about how much he hates un no cooked carrots not uncooked yes he's okay he's okay
with raw carrot uncooked carrot however fuck him no cooked cooked cooked um he's okay with
raw carrot but not uncooked carrot yes no he's okay with with raw carrot but he doesn't
he does not like cooked yeah we know and he thinks it's like the bane of like the entire
human race he hates it and then he moves on to actually playing guitar and it's ironically cool
he's actually good at playing the guitar and we want more you can see this covered in efap 64
watch it live uh on uh clash attack what's the new game raid shadow legends.com watch it there
bump bump bump the most ambitious RPG
and the best part the best part is free
because they contracted too the poor fuckers can't say anything out
diabeto war star oh my god look at this cast of characters in this movie how could you resist
I like that I'm uh Michonne
wait who's Rags he's who is that Rags is um he's Thor Rags is Thor and um it looks like
Don is Captain America I'm disappointed that Rags is not a woman and um what are the other ones we
got there so oh I guess one isn't relevant then he's just had his face blocked by um
oh right yeah you're right yeah I can't see him um
nobody's that's a good conversation to have free do you think this is a good poster for a movie
the original vision obviously I mean um I've huh what you mean the infinity war poster yeah
um my big problem with movie posters in general is that they seem to have an obsession with putting
the actors faces on it and when you have to do that it means there's a lot of things you can't do
the thing we talked about this off stream before but we really like the minimalist you know attempt
yes yes so if the poster was just like the gauntlet yeah you could have had just the gauntlet you
could have had maybe like Iron Man like you know like you could have him sort of flying forward
with a streak going behind it and then maybe like the silhouettes of a bunch of other superheroes
like I don't need the face that's the main thing I know who the actors are I guess they
sell better though is the thing probably I mean the one thing I will say is that this is like once
in a lifetime sort of a cool factor of how many like this is seriously all star and to have every
just to be like whoa that's how many people are in this movie um but it makes for a busy poster for
sure I guess the thing is though we look at like Super Smash Brothers they seem to handle I mean
it's kind of a mixed bag with Super Smash Brothers I think like some of the
covers are better than others but um hold on let me see the ultimate one Super Smash Brothers
Ultimate I don't know if it was like the most analogous yeah like Super Smash Brothers Ultimate
has like a fantastic poster it's really really good and um I don't know maybe it has to do with
the fact that it's all like painterly and it's not you know it's not all like it's clear that they
weren't taking pictures of these actors on different days and then just compiling it together you know
what I mean they're not actors that they're model no I know they're not those aren't photos
ringing you're racist James literally just said that they were painterly fuck them up bring it
go open your ears open your freaking ears yeah I think I'm destroying the journey it's funny
though I think endgame's like poster is probably stronger when it comes to just composition but
I like infinity war more so like I don't know I'm conflicted like I said it's once in a lifetime
it's like hey look at all these characters from the Marvel universe coming together but also I
love minimalist posters so yeah I think we can all agree that there is no poster than the Spider-Man
Homecoming poster oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait didn't you mean Far From Home
where they have that weird triangle thing going on yeah but like Homecoming has this weird shitty
looking like explosion fire thing on the screen oh yeah that poster isn't great like the one where
there's like two Spider-Mans and two Iron Mans and just like a couple random smiling people there
you know the thing the thing is right like the teaser posters for both of those movies are way
better this is a JJ Abrams skit in Fortnite this yeah this this poster is way better the um there
is a JJ Abrams skin in Fortnite that is correct that is crazy yeah that's a much better poster
it's a much much better poster like look at that someone someone's corrupt this but the one the
one where he's just lying down on a wall I think it's great yeah I like the Far From Home one
where he's got a bunch of stickers on it from places fucking JJ Abrams that's sad and Fortnite
is this this isn't a joke is this you can it's real a JJ Abrams skin this this is a direct problem
that not necessarily started with but was just as cringy when they involved and not involved
stupid Fortnite in endgame that was just as cringy stop it yeah keep it out stupid
money grab it tonaled was right what did he say about fallen order that
he shouldn't be so concerned with the bottom line tonaled is lord
I can't believe we just referenced a tonal video in a positively positive light
he knows what's up tonaled is amazing oh my god what is that
I don't know what is this supposed to be there's like Google images I don't know
the the Iron Man looks like that I was hacked alien
what do you why because his head is slightly bulbous
I don't know he just reminds me of him it just distills what's wrong with the posters like oh
we got the Washington point up there oh there's New York I guess here's a whole bunch of people
the one the rags just posted that was cool yeah like there should be things for him to hang off
no yeah we don't care there's a lot of cool teaser posters for spider-man but every time
they do the theatrical ones like all right take the mask off put the bad guy on there
put them all on there you know it's like guys stuff it you can get it oh my that that is busy
well that's that doesn't that doesn't look so cool I can't yeah like as much as I could
appreciate the drawing of it I can't fucking figure out what's happening I think what are
the circles at the bottom are they on discord
the actual illustrations are really good I just think the uh
it's too confusing someone put a lot of work into that like a deviant deviant art poster
okay I don't like that one as much as worse he told us the buildings
it makes sense because that's perspective idiot that's a pretty good one actually oh
there that was that looks great like that yeah hold on let me let me find the far from home
he's spider-man's in a bit of a weird pose it looks like he's like
he's gonna drag that ass across the floor if he's okay this this should have been the actual
poster for far from home oh yeah yeah I like that one yeah really really I thought that was
the poster for far from home it's it was the teaser it's the teaser poster the actual poster
is this one yeah please post the real one it was fucking it's weird it's the triangle one right
yeah oh my god that looks awesome it's weird it's not good why is there a triangle because
Mysterio does have triangles when he does his powery things I think that's what supposed to be
yeah but like I don't know this is why is that
hang on hang on why is um why is like mg there is like just why has she not got shading on hook
like he didn't have a brown lego I don't know I'll sell you man it just looks like a 3d render
that they put in there the other ones look 3d she looks like the fill tool on a different
lego piece here's a better version it looks like oh my god this is
this is why we have not been getting through memes quickly this tree
I like how memes are delaying us by the way that's pretty I guess the issue with this one is it's
too spoilery but I don't know I like Mysterio's design I like the costume how is that spoilery
because it kind of it makes him look evil he's looming over him I guess kind of kind of
the issue is that I like the poster a lot yeah I guess the issue is um when it comes to Mysterio
it's like if you know the comics you're like oh when he's obviously a bad guy a lot of people
argue that the the spoiler is already done because most people know but I don't think
most people well that's the thing I think I would argue most general audiences don't actually know
well I think they're going to be the guy in the fish helmet
not well most people who know spider-man know but that's not many people
in regards to the whole that homecoming poster is really great yeah that's a really good one
I think it's too busy though with the webs and like the smudges all over it it looks
I'm not sure I think it's uh I think it's I think it's really good that one's he's not
so super he's not super imposed on the karti well like no he's not like yeah looks a bit oh god
that foot yeah that looks weird looking real flat footed there but I still kind of like the poster I
guess that's a good poster this is this is top tier poster for spider-man honestly right
if they release that so who wants to get back to memes what yeah these are the names
oh I think that's where we were we did that yeah that was a weird tangent we we got here
from looking at posters I'm sure this one won't lead us to talking about posters too
iron man homecoming bluster back your man and knuckles
I'm really disappointed that there's no you're gone
featuring Dante from the devil
they
photoshopped Robert Dowdy Jr's face on the falcon
I'll chance you mean vulture not falcon
there's one, two, three, four, five, six, Robert's here
he called vulture falcon
I mean they both have wings whatever
falcon's such a worthless cake
yeah
vulture is unironically way better as a character than falcon
he is
I'm sorry I'm so tired but streaming for so long
I love that you started your stream I went to bed and then I woke up and I was like oh the stream's
still going yeah we restarted so we'd have enough time to read all the superchats I'm
starting to get concerned we won't oh god we haven't even got to him yet
age of capsian marvel did you see that
capsian marvel I actually in like three hours I really will have oh
no all right uh let's we're gonna we're gonna crank this up folks we're gonna start moving
faster so caption marvel we got all the players here that's uh unfortunately age of ultron sucks
oh wait what anyway next meme okay where else can I teach you who the rooftop god was it's
fucking raw I love that one Gordon Ramsay Gordon Ramsay's great I'm he's fucking great
I watch his shows he goes in the trophy case of humans he totally does yes he does uh so this
is Arlo saying that the
good meme this is uh er being this is a this is a tweet that came from the Sid Nicholson picture
I believe it's the uh relevant meme yeah no that was a this was a stratum ire wasn't it well it
used to be I think this meme was inspired by stratum eyes one I feeding him the can of uh
what was it just rights video on Cora like it woke the fuck yeah the fuck up because
my goodness praising Cora that's evil um this is the tree of discourse what makes good rat you
got uh what's what's the 11 o'clock what is that what's that referencing probably the 11 hour no
that's 11 hours yeah 11 hours so we oh I guess I mean we go to 12 like 11 55 you call out 12 not
assuming it's referencing the cap I guess I'm willing to agree with that does thou lift look
at wamen TLJ is a stupid does objective even fucking jokers how do they work milk the rhinos
closed-minded no leftist Luke looks like a lesbian adaptation it's the constant battle of
true memory yeah I quite like this favorite part of the known leftist thing is the known
like known yeah people are aware of it as opposed to an unknown leftist what a fucking secret
leftist all we have to do is exist and movie circle chick get fucking annoyed
have they been taking snipes to dust recently all right fringy tell me decipher this tell me
what's happening what the fuck uh so I guess the scribble at the top is like oh I'm getting cold
so you're gonna have to hold on to that okay jay jay decipher this okay so the isle of man flag
is being destroyed unfortunately all right I uh I said did he really not meet but he did
himself for the unmuting to speak on the phone
oh my god yeah I'm all right I bought some fish Australians what can I say fish buyer
but I wasn't all right but I bought some fish and now I am yeah so that's you know I was I was
really feeling down but I bought some fish and everything just turned around things are looking
up what kind of fish was it cod we can still hear it fringy tell us what fish it was
um you guys want to take bets on what kind of fish it was um tilapia
I think it was a nice uh nice salmon we've got to keep going on these memes
jay go okay so you're like an amorphous cloud destroying the isle of man legs
I'm gonna go with that yeah can you see like I've got a hand on the bottom left ish
but it looks like it's disconnected from me like I'm ripping the leg off with yeah I think
I think you're supposed to be like a you're like rayman a lot of the the images relation to the
isle of man flag have me afraid of it or killing it and I'm like dude I love the isle of man flag
why would I kill it yeah that shit is fantastic do you think it has three sets of genitals or
no sets of genitals well you would have one set if it was two legs and then an extra leg means a
half a set so one and a half sets I suppose oh that's my opinion what what what kind does it have
well that's my opinion so does it have to be Sunday guys it's Sunday come on it's been Sunday
for like five and a half hours rex it has yeah yeah it's for him oh yeah for fringy it's been
Sunday for ages what's the international date line when how long has it been Sunday internationally
I kind of would have like I want to ask him about all the things he's been talking about
when he comes back I want to ask him why the fuck he unmuted like why would he do that
all right we have to you know it would give us names the islay of man mauler versus jenny the
massive the entire world gripped by terror oh that's cool hmm this is this is gojira right
I'm gojira we've got kingador in the background I think Jenny is um I don't know my gojira enough
to know what they did guys what he did he did what for you did he did it yeah all right he did
for you did it yeah this this meme works with context and without it
he's such a good character though this is also a twist this is also something what kind of fish
was it fringy what what kind of fish was it yeah fringy it was goth fish goth it was goth
you no like a real fish no what was the fuck is goth fish not like a real one what is that
it's like why was it why was it so important that it was Sunday
huh you did it why is it like I mean why is someone talking to you about fish on a Sunday
I'm not unmuted but I didn't so now it's what did you do for me you said I did it what did you
well done you did it I applaud you yeah I'm not providing the context of this discussion
that means it's shady but I didn't press mute so yeah awesome I thought you muted and unmuted was
that must have been what happened then because that was an accident
um well you let us in on your entire conversation so we did I know I mean what do you mean
what do you did it what do I mean I had goth fish that's what I'm telling you
but why was it on a Sunday what do you mean on a Sunday you don't even understand what that's
I know we only heard your side of the conversation so we now need the context
I don't want to give it to you well you said oh it's is it shady or is it very
why are you hiding it from us a lot to believe anymore yeah Frank here are we not your best
friends your only friends Jesus Christ no he's got his garfish dealer how exactly explain how
Garfield became a fish okay well here's the context so I got some garfish and I was talking
about how great it was that my garfish dealer was available on a Sunday to give it to me because
he's not normally where you have an actual fish dealer a scarfish slang for something is that is
that the big is that the big crack is that what that is a scarfish slang for coke I just assumed
that you guys knew what garfish is or maybe it's just oh my god it's it's a fucking it's a curvy
fish it's not garfish you're in fucking the United Kingdom look at that holy shit well we don't even
look at this look at this it's a sea fish it's in your waters yeah I know what it is look at that
it's it's like what am I facing a fish that broke its back why why does this fish exist
fringy even if they're if they're in our waters I'm not sure that we eat them
holy shit they're long oh my god are they a longman fish they have the longman fish yes I've
I've never heard of garfish because when you say that over here we have alligator gar and
like that like fucking fish that are angry with lots of teeth and stuff oh it seems like they
vary quite dramatically in size so we've got that big one that I just put in we've also got this one
apparently remarkable republicans in the chat who wants to debate us
we're we're debating garfish wait you're fucking dude
so fricky garfish real or fake it's real I ate it
then I got Australia's night on conference that's just what a fucking lie I would say
you ate the gar fish and didn't I didn't like huh what are you talking about why didn't you
share your car fish with us you always share your fish I just like put it in my computer
important question yeah it looks like it slips right through the ethernet cable
important question okay ready do you think it was a good joke that they commented on the
inaccuracy of the stormtroopers in Mandalorian episode six um what are you oh yeah it's kind of
funny rags assault him uh no I don't want it to be like an in-universe thing that stormtroopers
are incompetent and can't aim all right that's a good point actually all right I'll walk it back
wow well all right then back to garfish
back to garfish what's there to talk about uh because we have uh let me show you um we don't
believe garfish exist I think that's an Australian conspiracy well it's part of the Australian
conspiracy they've they've well-builded like you know loads of the uh loads of the wildlife
uh it's willed built idiot world builders god you so well-builded it
because okay they're similar but this is what we've got we got these uh these here alligator
garrs no that wasn't the fucking teeth and shit fuck you up what the fuck is that that's a
that's an alligator gar that's not an alligator that's a that's a fish okay look I'm going to
post it again you guys are not appreciating the power of this meme would you not would you would
you not would you not sit on his lap absolutely wow that's a hell of a photoshop job yeah well
I'm starting to wonder if he's ever great is there a picture of him I can't believe I'm looking this
up this is on my computer Jeb Bush Santa so I want to remind you right so we said if we replace
Gandalf with Hitler I think it would make for a very Lord of the Rings mine towers
oh god um what else we got
I think it's just a picture but I think this already existed without it being a meme that makes sense
it's weird like wags Sargon has this initials that he destroys things he comes out of that
he fucking like efap that's the only efap we've actually had to stop during right I don't think
we've ever had that before yeah I don't think it's ever happened it's a weird man no no no the um
the meme one we had to stop sharing no no we didn't we just had to stop covering that video
we carried on oh yeah even then so you got long sword long fish long bow long man these are
all from the same fish like a like a gar fish
I don't know what is this help me
what is what is it I said it isn't impossible to believe the earth is a marsh
when did you when was that when did that come up and why
oh it was the nature of belief yeah oh yeah yeah that was the um the all-o episode
when cookie when cookie wants to commit to genocide I can't believe none of you remembered that
what am I supposed to remember everything yes that's racist it's a job you think because I'm
white that I remember everything but I didn't say it like that you said it like that
that's true this is a good meme so why is skywalkers pg-13 and yet it's meant for children
but you know everyone what is the definition of children in terms of age group is it from like
as much as like five to seventeen or something all right so hang on are you saying that someone
under five isn't a child what are they a baby a four year a four year old is not a baby they
can be you kidding me oh my my two sisters five-year-olds are often still referred to as babies by my
family um so it says that a child is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty oh
hang on a minute I'm wrong by that definition sure but uh the definition of the word the
definition that's that's some tism because fucking I'm just talking about how it's colloquially
used in my culture so get fucked colloquially yeah I didn't I didn't say I was going by the
dictionary so get fucked green man okay but now now we are going by the dictionary oh is that right
well if we're going by the dictionary then I'll have to ask you what the definition is wouldn't I
because I don't go by the dictionary 24 seven why did you go before with your definitions like
oh well I was going colloquially which is what everyone does before checking the dictionary
you used anecdotal evidence yes that's that means you lose the debate that's that is racist
well I mean I don't know that's biased against mode the point is that Patrick Wilms thinks
children and he is absolutely correct because yes no adult ever enjoyed star wars all right so get
fucked see I do like the whole thing of star wars is meant for children and like people get their
arms cut off routinely it's just common in jeff we try please clap I like how the coin vision of
him still looks like depressed fuck it I guess I'm president whatever please can someone manufacture
this wait hang on isn't manufacturing currency illegal like um I mean that's not legal tender
well if it were if you were trying to pass it off as such well sure but we're not done it we're just
gonna have well well I'm just letting you guys know you shouldn't try and purchase any kind of
thing with this okay keep it to yourselves okay I mean oh my god can you imagine actually giving
this to a vendor and they look at it they just say like I voted for him too isn't it um I would
assume it's illegal to try and pay with stuff that isn't money it's just you know the shop is
obviously gonna reject it is it no I don't think it is well what if you bought uh what if you bought
like um you know an older you know like how people collect antique coins what if you decided to use
that antique coin is the cops gonna beat you on no it's still it's still legal no like coins don't
expire if you're using it no they do they do they do when they're um okay so in britain we used to
use shillings those you can't use those anymore shillings yeah you actually had i think it was
shilling well it was like 20 pounds to the shilling and 12 shillings to the pound or some
shit it was yeah he's calling you an old man fight him back fuck him up i'm not an old man
i know this because i watched doctor here well they're not that makes you an old man you can't
know the difference between expiration and being able to use it as like actual legal tender you're
pretty much always able to swap it out i doubt that you'd be able to swap out some shillings
they went out like 50 years ago i think no normally whenever they're moving from one to
another yeah you can stop it up for a while but you can't anymore like i guess uh maybe i don't
know because um in australia we used to use the australian pound and that got out of circulation
length in the 70s so i'm not sure that if i tried to pay for something with an australian pound that
i'd get beat up and arrested wait why did she get beat up why was that the thing well because the
whole thing was isn't illegal to use um you know fucking australian police roughed you up that's
fucked up dude no well i i initially used it as american police but then i just translated over
here for our money what that actually do is say come on mate come on you know just use your head
how did you just fail to do an australian accent with that impression like looks like i'm gonna
change them for their decimal three literally can't fail because he's from australia that
doesn't make that's my point man give it a go what do you mean that's your point you just said
he failed he can't i can't fail what's my accent that's the same as people say like
molds have a welsh accent it's like from wales
the fact that you're from somewhere doesn't mean that you have that place's accent
well that's no yeah sure but i have it though yeah no i agree i agree with that the implication
is that it's a fake and it's like well if i'm born and bred in wales and i have this accent
then this accent is welsh by definition but it could still be not what was understood typically
as a welsh accent i don't fucking sound like i'm from lester yeah but that's your fault
where are you from jay i'm from lester you're from lester that's why i said that no you we just
established that you don't have to sound like a place that you're lester sure yeah that's why
it's that's my point i was saying well i don't sound like the i don't have an accent from the
place i'm from yeah i don't sound like i'm from wales either do i exactly that's what i said
yeah but i'm from wales so like a jamaican or something yeah no this is the welsh accent i
don't give a shit if you think it's like jamaican me that's fucking stupid like you know
like just because it's not like movies and stuff doesn't mean you don't know what it sounds like
fucking dr dulittle over there is gonna be happening but he's like whispering and shit
it's fucking stupid
but are you like are you fuckers like not aware of how the welsh accent sounds like like
no i've seen touchwood who is this part of you i've never been this is literally the welsh
accent you fucking idiots like i feel like you're an adequate yet sloppy lover what
do we need to test this out i don't i don't mind because it's an adequate i feel like i have no
problem getting fucked but it would just be really messy you know no like i'm fucking adequate i'm
all right well i'll settle with that okay that's all right this is because this is because of the
accent like ironically uh one of the one of the big reasons why i wanted to separate myself from
the tizzleby welsh language was when i was in high school one of um someone like annoyed someone else
and he outraged with this scenario said oh why did you do that for and i was like yeah
well facts are fucking balls so is the so is the words they use they sound like cavemen
why did you do that for
is the child is lost
the welsh accent is just not um in media enough for people to know what it sounds like
it's tisney though i don't this is the thing i don't use that accent um but i never really had
a strong welsh accent but the thing is people listening to my videos could tell i had a welsh
accent because the way that i pronounce certain words like are there any certain words that are
like a yeah yeah no earth earth i remember earth milk that was a thing just because i don't say
earth milk all the all the milk that i drink is earth milk yeah sea rags is on my team yeah i
love her no i i like hellman milk ew martian milk i was hacked molar is confirmed jamaica welshman
that's something build a bear but welsh people jamaica jamaica milk that sounds like a drink
you'd order at a bar is like hey can i get a jamaica well i'm ironically right uh so robert
dani's union is going to be in the doc dulil film he's supposed to be doing a welsh accent but he's
like whispering throughout the whole thing and he's sort of doing it but uh all the comments
section like what the fuck is this accent all welsh people are like that's kind of our accent
um i'm gonna jump the line with the memes i just got sent this
can we can we officially can we officially officially official official i mean i would
have gone with da fringy but jesus i don't know i mean i'm not going with that here's another
gawfish meme i've got loads of like fucking iron man posters or whatever to get rid of too
oh my god we're not even close my favorite part is that they did that with the bucket tool instead
of like adjusting the hero saturation yeah it's just like the worst possible way of doing it
and it makes it look so much better as a meme all right where were we no yes yes oh my god someone
just drew an amazing picture in efap podcast talk send it over oh i'm fucking doing it

had more to drink but i have so what was what did you want to talk about oh you know whatever
you guys want to talk about i realized this was a special stream until i got into it because i
didn't see like the first few hours so um did you say that you wanted to debate something yeah i
just wanted to you know debate a little star wars or game of thrones or something of that nature
that's cool with you guys are you sure that the the layer is best friend hot rather than
just super hot i'm 100 positive about that yes what about when she's wearing the bikini
oh that that's not too bad but um still best friend she should have done that in the other
two movies also i mean hmm sure i wouldn't have said no to it yeah yeah that's what i'm saying
right i mean yeah we're gonna do a personally i think all of the characters should have
do you still feel that vader is a rip off of robocop oh no i'll look that one up i guess
so if you okay if you were at a spaceship and landed on mars and you wanted to go outside
what would you wear and you could wear a space suit i guess right i mean yeah that would be my
choice what an odd question jay why would you ask him that yeah jay there's there's context
like wellies what did you think welly
hey only wellies what was wellies well wellies are like big old rubber booties
to prevent the mud from getting to your socks oh i mean yeah as long as it's somewhat pressurized
you'd be all right i think wellies are pressurized hey okay just because you say that doesn't mean
it's not the cheap jetty lens but the expensive wellies expensive wellies the space wellies
i'm imagining someone of us wearing wellies but nothing else
i imagine c3po where can okay honest question can gay people wear wellies
i don't know what wellies are so think harder they are like big rubber boots
without laces or anything they just let you slip them on
walking in mud your kind of rain boots that girls wear well yeah those those they're very
popular in the uk sure i guess i mean let me let me know if you're somebody
you can buy in a store you can wear um including macaroni
what do you have only if you only have one foot are you wearing wellies are you wearing welly
you're just wearing well do you think it was fast couple do you think it was a smart decision to
put the catapults of the front of the army in game of thrones i mean the treasury chaise sorry
yeah i do why reason is they assume that the armies of the night would arrive
by day so it would give you the maximum time and space to fire at them from afar
but that's not the maximum time and space they're in the front of the army
but if you're there behind the castle walls they don't have a clear line of sight that's the
if they're behind the walls more trebucides don't need a line of sight that's like the advantages
that they don't need a lot are you f***ing retarded do you not know how trebuche works
okay if you fire i mean i've looked i've looked up stuff i mean i've learned a lot of stuff about
military things since i did my privatization series but when when you're firing okay you're
like there's a lot of velocity so the range you'll have when you're firing and okay so
so you realize having the behind the castle walls gives them more range than having them
in front closer to the enemy army the big thing is right no matter how much range you gain from
putting them at the front you have zero range when they're destroyed first
once the dead close uh they're not going to be useful anyway unless you will in the killer
i disagree why would the zombies arrive by day why would they why would they not there's i mean
if you think about it because their whole thing is night they paid attention their boss is called
the night king i'm aware of this also existed during the day i mean we see pictures of them
today i mean it's not like all you're right if their strategy is to rush the castle with
melee weapons wouldn't it be advantageous to use the cover of night nobody said they exist during
the day too not really i mean you know they could fight during night or day they had a massive
advantage i mean i guess but they wanted you're saying you're saying you're saying that they
actually their strategy worked because it was at night that helped a lot i mean because so why
would they go in the day sense that they would do it at night then like it makes perfect sense i mean
yeah if they if they can plan it that precisely but i mean
i guess the night is half of the 24 hour period
one of you guys criticized the fact that they had to don't rocky charge but i mean that's how
it works no that's not how cavalry works buddy you don't know anything about military tactics
you don't use light cavalry to start a frontal assault it kills me they literally had no
support they would say
mr rr you you realize they all died immediately yes they did next episode and there were a lot
of doth rocky around the show's bullshit they basically said that they had like what are you
gonna believe the editing or you're lying why are you posting wellies we actually don't know
if some of them were able to deliver them right off how could they have possibly lived though
like surely they would have come back you know the same way that their their zombies did but
they didn't it's just nothing but zombies so they're all dead how many doth rocky zombies did you see
did you miss the part where the night king raised the dead
but where were the rocky zombies they just wrote they were they were in the crowd they were
attacking denaris and all those guys you try to argue to us that the fact that they were dead
rather than zombies is a win i think you guys are overestimating the number of doth rocky
here i think we're i think you're overestimating the amount of functioning brain cells in your
head
i mean how many uh cavalry charges have you led lately
anything about cavalry charges because we haven't been in them is that how it works
i haven't drank battery acid
but what good is that gonna do if you're basing into a brick wall of dead people
it's just a wall of zombies you're gonna die
it's pitch black they don't even see them it's like a meter ahead of them and then they're all
dead you can see all the better course of action definitely would not have been sending
your cavalry in as the front like the full throttle assault to die instantly and be used against you
uh no i mean that's clearly i mean i think that's clearly the move to make
aren't that useful in the defensive that you have to attack somewhere don't even use them at all
you just put them with all the other dudes they didn't wait until the zombies were against the
wall then they flank from the sides of the castle like basically this would be i mean
this would be like if you had people swimming across the english channel to invade norman
i mean i don't i think you're underestimating how tough the doth rocky are in an attack but
also they can't defend all the time they can't kill us all the time
how many how many dead did it take with them we don't know it wouldn't matter because they
become zombies anyway it doesn't happen so much later in the battle which he could have done at
any time at this time you have no idea if the night king or any of his subjects raised the dead
between that moment and later you have no idea and we know for sure it happened at least once
your entire argument rests on the idea that the white walkers decided not to raise the dead at
that point they seem to have a lot of numbers going into that you're right you know what you're
right they had millions anyway why you don't because if you if you can do that at any point
your casualties are irrelevant you can give the other side of false sense of hope then raise the
dead you're like gotcha why would the zombies giving them loads of free treats
go on i'll give you a sporting chance to kill us go on do it
the ultimate the ultimate 40 test tactic is just killing your own troops
to own the zombie kill your own troops to own the zen
if you didn't think the dead would get back up i mean it kind of makes sense
they know that they do though they know how this works
do they all know that because i don't know
they saw it at heart home i haven't even seen the show and i know that
witnessed them raise the dead at heart home he would have told everybody by the way they
could raise the dead to fight in their army but did he know they could they could do it at
en masse though i mean he watched it happen in heart home he watched it he was sitting there
converted the wildling army which is supposed to be one of the largest armies in west eros into
zombies remember that happening that sounds cool i want to watch this film i'm gonna go get some
more pizza you're telling me that you don't remember the one good thing from all of season
five no i guess not i guess that was what do you remember like do you remember like what happened
six seconds ago have you ever engaged your brain in your entire life wolf be nice a few times
like when i uh destroyed you just now on this point about game of thrones
and also like uh the whole king's landing battle i mean that one actually i think you guys
she fucking wiped out everyone there was no battle it was over she took out all the crossbows
like just like that and that was over she she made the militarily wise decision to go
kill children the militarily wise decision to execute she was trying to create a path for her
troops to continue to advance what is that what you think that was she burned the city to the
ground her troops didn't mean how are you meant to advance when it's all on fire all right it's not
fire there's no words anymore if anything you made it way harder to get they literally retreat
because the city is falling apart they have to run away from their own leader when you're when
you're sacking a city people can nod up in the street especially narrow streets like king's
landing and at that point then her already depleted forces from the previous battle could
take additional casualties so if you clear the streets by blaming concentrations it helps i need
it wasn't concentrated it was the whole thing it was the whole city she killed everyone
she killed people who were well out of the way of the battle
uh i mean i don't think it showed that many civilian deaths i think people were reacting
it destroyed the whole city the whole city was on fire our fair civilians ulting got killed
that doesn't mean you go out of your way to kill them hey they just happened to be in the way
she killed children in the next episode
she saw them there but she still had to clear the street she had to clear the street of screaming
no women and children would get in the way of the invading i'm sure john was very thankful
that those children are out of the way that was that was the problem with john
yeah we wouldn't want to let those kids get hurt by the arms back worked
you don't understand how what works sorry and understand how the sack of a city worked i mean
you should be saying right there this is so like you know how when germany invaded paris they
didn't just kill every single person that was in the city you know that right they're mistake right
yeah they surrendered in the show
all the troops can't lay down their arms though they were still resisting
they literally threw down their weapons there that was in there i saw that scene
they literally threw down their weapons and then picked them back up because they were being
melted by horrible fire i can't believe this is happening
well did the danares hear from surcy that she surrendered did
surcy wave a flag on the tower the bells i thought the whole point of the bell
this isn't even that doesn't have direct access to the bells how was she gonna send a message
you're down to the bell city surrendered she's surrendered what what's she gonna do
now i don't surrender and then die she's got her king's guard she has to get a
mobile phone call from okay so she's got a king's guard so let's burn all of the children
that's not what i said but like the big that's the thing that's the action that she took that
you were defending currently no when she burned the city i don't know if danares heard the bells
john heard them and we know that from the scene but she definitely she literally people argue the
bells sent her insane that's what people actually argue uh i don't know how bill would send somebody
insane i agree with you i don't know how bell said someone insane unless that's the first time
in her life she's heard of bill which i would never heard it hang on that's that's i really
want to question that why would that send you insane if you'd never heard a bell before like
oh my god what's that i'm just speculating oh my god what's the reason why somebody would think
that but i mean i don't know well no we're just up there top 10 what a what a season
fidelity this is i'm gonna get another beer this is like the end of phase one
who knows what phase we're at at this point
um why did you spell in your video a game of thrones season eight story arcs like arc as in
you know like noah's arc that's how you spell the word arc you spelt it a-r-k-s but you're talking
about you're talking about story arcs though right correct yeah a story arc is not spelt
with a k it's spelt with a c that doesn't sound right it's hold on fringy i love you man
i mean i don't know what to tell you man like a cool mix of wikipedia that's how it's spelt i don't
know all right well i mean you got anything to say to me it's gotta oh i mean whatever oh god no
oh god no okay i think we'll all just be able to mute and shad you're taking the freight
i need this please shad pick up the phone
who is shad he's kind of an idiot he thinks he knows shit about medieval stuff i was i was
going to see if he could talk we like we like to humor him yeah well here's the thing here's
the thing they're all lying he's your worst fucking nightmare and i'm gonna love the next
five minutes why would you say that when he hasn't answered the call yet worst nightmare pick up the
phone no hold on he just wants to drag out the suspense i will agree that
do what uh no you're wrong man sorry like it's spelt off with a c like don't you saw yeah you
sent me the link i saw it i didn't know there was another version of the word i thought it was just
you mean like the ark of the covenant everyone's got knowledge caps no that's fine yes fine it's
fine right survival evolved uh why why is the outer world's cultural moxism
the game clearly promotes anti-capitalism and it does so pretty unapologetically how so i
haven't played it i mean okay so you start out you you're in this world where there is a board
of corporations running everything and it's basically just all humor about how these companies
are evil and how their products suck and how all the people who lead these companies are corrupt
and incompetent why is that anti-capitalist by its very nature though that's literally the only
kind of joke this in the entire thing so that can be anti-corruption i i doubt that that's the
only joke in the game being being against corruption and capitalism against being against
capitalism it literally is okay it's a strong man argument against capitalism it literally is
no one interpreted the one who said it was an argument
you all right what well i'm just viewing myself because i can't control myself
you're fine mauler hang in there i'm doing it so you can do it none of you guys have played outer
worlds no no i don't i feel like i don't need to to know that you're not telling me
so i mean i'm pretty sure you would agree with me if you play the game we put it that way i feel
that the only jokes in the game are anti-capitalist much i mean i'm sure you have an occasional sex
joke but i mean i played about five hours of it and it was just oh so you didn't beat it
it uh the game pissed me off it pissed the game off why is that the way you didn't finish it what
how did it the story was just i mean the story was just shitting all over capitalism i mean i
don't want to let's let's let's let's actually dive deeper if the story was shitting
exclusively on capitalism why is that necessarily a bad story because it's a false story i mean
what do you mean a false story what if that's what stories are real capital is meritocracy by
it's very is it no no no you can have no because you've got um i love capitalism but there's
definitely nepotism and capitalism yeah yeah i'm especially i love capital there's a lot that goes
on capitalism favors those who are already rich but well no that's just money that's just money
favors those who are always rich yeah that's what i that's why that's what i mean like there's
money in this way okay in the game outer worlds i think they go through seven or eight companies
eventually from what i've read in reviews would every company be led by someone who is completely
and totally retarded i met the guy in the first village who was running the cannery and i mean
this guy was completely moronic he was unable to run his business he he had let a bunch of people
walk out of the camp he couldn't do anything about them he couldn't make people work he couldn't
well what how does how does somebody make people work if they don't want to i mean if you're the
boss you figure out how to do that whether it's through persuasion force what have you got to do
i mean it's game yeah in this game they own their employees i mean if you you know you
guess that's not capitalism yeah it's i'm pretty sure that is capitalism no you don't own your
workers no that is still so that's still by definition capitalism it's just not the capitalism
capitalist system that we use being unable to negotiate your uh own working conditions
they did they signed contracts when they moved to this solar system
right you could call it indentured server too but i mean it's a fair price for being
transported is it a fair price i don't have a person ship i don't think that's fair are there
like how else do you pay for that kind of interstellar travel money with money with money
how are you not have enough money unless you have a job yeah you got a job you do that by being rich
yeah do it without money wow that's an interesting commentary on capitalism oh wow whoops i mean the
last i checked uh space travel was not exactly listed as a necessity was it uh but i thought we
needed to go to mars to set up an ethno state no no no no not an ethno state theocracy theocracy
an ethno state would be barbaric and backwards this is the only the only groups that have enough
resources to colonize and then the morality to keep a community like that together under harsh
conditions probably would be a church organization like mostly only groups with enough money would
be a church like scientology scientology i mean they'd probably fuck it up but they you know
they're welcome they would but everyone's welcome would direct them to the light let's see you know
i mean you know elitist back to the home planet there are also a lot of benefits of a space
colony that would i don't think you're considering like especially say for all people who know we
like space colony no we don't disagree with the space pot we like the space colony space colonies
are a big thumbs up for me and for me i like space i want me some space i saw at astra it's the final
frontier at astra oh you haven't had astra movie review i haven't seen it what what do you like at
astra did you like that oh wait wait wait wait wait okay okay so sorry i gotta i'm the host i
gotta redirect this conversation now myself j fringy rags wolf if we could all stay silent
and allow these two gentlemen to to talk about shad do you remember episode three of game of
thrones season eight yes the castle defense from the army of zombies do you remember this
oh oh yeah that one absolutely i do remember this um i would like remarkable republican
how do you what do you think of the defense of the castle i'll let you start and then i will
be silent i think that the defense that danny and john mounted was fundamentally sound based on
medieval realism they deployed the catapults forward so they'd have the maximum distance to
fire at the approaching enemy they were shipping the enemy would arrive by day they sent the cavalry
to charge because the cavalry needed space and momentum to be effective so their opening moves
were solid they also divided their defenders between outside the castle walls and inside
so we're defending all parts at all times i don't see how they could have done much better than what
they did they also had their dragons doing close air support and looking out for the other dragons
so i feel like they mounted a pretty competent and respectable defense do you know what castles are
meant to be um yeah they're also a cavalry when when is when is it preferable to use cavalry
in um open warfare three percent of the time no uh battle of ashen core massive french cavalry
charge got absolutely wiped out by english archers there are many situations no there are
many situations when cavalry is a terrible idea and the situation when they were using game of
thrones is most definitely one of them well the the dead didn't have archers though so it's not ashen
core no no no but see the other situation cavalry primarily is used for shock tactics hopefully to
try and break up a unit formation and you want to get them to flee if they don't flee and they
storm the cavalry the cavalry will be dead and so after the first impact if the infantry isn't
breaking up the cavalry needs to retreat otherwise they're going to get mowed down now with an army
of the dead do they retreat that i'm aware of no the the army of the dead don't retreat um and
they were also outnumbered as well the other time when you can use cavalry to just really mow down
infantry is if you are outnumbering them in a large measure you have a lot more cavalry but even that
that's even then that's not a a guaranteed thing uh it always needs to be used with the right you
know reason and consideration and stuff like that but in regards to the game of thrones situation
the cavalry was outnumbered and the undead weren't retreat and so sending them in is utter and
complete suicide especially looking at it from the historical lens of what cavalry is meant to do
and when they're meant to be employed and shad are there different kinds of cavalry oh yeah light
cavalry heavy cavalry and stuff like that and what's interesting about the game of thrones
technically the dothraki are light cavalry um and so that is like to use light cavalry in a heavy
frontal assault charge into infantry like that is absolute just completely retarded because they're
they're not unarmored so sorry they're not wearing heavy armor to survive the uh melee that they're
running into they don't have lances so there's no insta kill on the direct hit impact they are
they are armed with like small sickles and stuff like that which means they can't strike anyone in
front of their horse okay yeah can only strike people with these type of weapons on the sides
of your horse which means you can't remove or attack anyone in front of you and so you're just
presenting your horse to be killed in that way you might be underestimating the skill of these
guys who have been kicking so much ass in the show so so they're superhumans and they they were
dominating an isos probably because they were being used in the right way as light cavalry
should be skirmishing harrying around the edges and stuff like that there was also a lot of
mounted archers with the dothraki if i recall um and again just like the mongolians historically
uh light cavalry you run around it and like if you look at history um there were actually some
interesting games between the mongolians and uh eastern europeans you can kind of call them
knights but not about anyway armored you know european very medieval kind of combatants and
they got absolutely mowed down by the mongolians because mongolians were employing their light
cavalry to just perfect you know just in a perfect amount and it was basically running around them
pinging them from a distance not running into heavily armored units i mean the only the only
weakness of the mongols historically is if they'd ever run across real european knights i mean
there's no way in hell they could have gone up toe to toe with like richard the lion hard
or like the mongolians trashed um the europeans when they like we're talking about mounted you
know um uh units whenever they engaged they won like if you're looking at the from the medieval
technological standpoint also have you ever seen a uh have you ever seen a picture of the mongolian
empire and how far west yeah that's when it's a russia they were they were past russia they were
almost Constantinople i mean they were they were pretty far west and they didn't conquer anywhere
where they had true knights no you would call them true well hang on how do you define true
knights so you're talking about uh heavily armored cavalry because the mongolians did defeat
the mongolians did defeat heavily armored cavalry that sword and no no no no the mongolians did
defeat heavily armored cavalry it's historical it's it happened were they knights what how do you
define knights um you have to have the equipment and you also have to have a coat of chivalry
how do you define the coat of chivalry it's the coat of chivalry uh it's just like the coat of
conduct that they all follow i mean it's the name that makes them who they are is there more i mean
do you think that every kingdom had the same coat of chivalry for every you know knight group that
they had why are you like conflating why are you conflating like all of europe as though it's the
same fring is actually completely right here chivalry was a subjective subjective thing
interpreted by the knights and its most accurate application is chivalry means the qualities that
make a knight good at his job and it started with pure horsemanship because chivalry comes from the
word chivalier and if you go back it basically translates to horseman originally and so if you
were good at horse riding or technically combative horse riding you were chivalrous in the original
genesis of the word um and as it evolved it simply expanded to mean the qualities that made a knight
good at his job and when you look i made a whole video on this all right like specialties and and
when you go back and actually look at how chivalry was interpreted historically there are like there
was never a codified unified thing that everyone followed and there were forms of chivalry that
one person would call chivalrous and another group of people would think that's completely
incorrect and their version of chivalry would outrightly contradict something um sorry about
the kids in the background by the way and so so the following chivalry like is a very essential
part of what defines you know a knight to be a knight but not necessarily means that they're
going to be better at mounted combat than many other people of the medieval period and the type
it doesn't make their type of mounted combat different from other heavily armored mounted
you know warriors who were not knighted of the period okay and so when you're looking at heavy
cavalry of the medieval period the fact that one group might be knighted and one group might not
be won't change how effectively that you could employ them in combat is my point similarly like
the skill of the dothraki for instance won't change that little sickle into a lance yes that's
i mean the circle back something you said stuck with me um so you said that the code of chivalry
was subjective so were the knights like some sort of post-modernist or something that doesn't
post-modernist
what
do
where's your connection there i'm i'm i mean i thought i thought chivalry was supposed to be an
objective code of conduct like no no no no no no the big problem that you have is that you're
assuming that all of europe is like the same and that they all believe the same things and all
held the sort of like europe is not like america it's a whole bunch of different countries thank
god yeah that's absolutely right i mean um when you look at the actual books written of chivalry
like um uh there's one written by crétien de trois and then there's uh like again i have all the
references in my video and stuff like that they are trying to describe how they feel a knight
which is actually a direct kind of point of reference to show that not every knight was
behaving the way that they felt they should otherwise there's no point in them even writing
their books in the first place all right and so uh another one was by ramen lull okay um so chivalry
meant many different things depending on how different areas knights and even wards felt
what made a good knight and if you did those call if you perform those qualities that the
individual lords or even the individual knights felt made a knight good at their job they were
then chivalrous by these individual definitions okay i think i got you so they're not do you still
think they're post-modernists i didn't i didn't realize there were different codes of chivalry i
mean um that's not really something that pops up well i mean did you did you really think that
like british knights had the same code as french knights and you know yeah why would you think that
though yeah that that's a huge misconception there was no unified code of chivalry that everyone
was forced to adhere to i mean it sounds like you you think that there was like some rule book on
society you know like a society rule book that's like you doing this i mean that's what i thought
like special night loose nah sorry so you're wrong about that one then right i guess i was
so um what wasn't that made someone like say a richard linehard or like some of the other really
uh really good knights what was it that made them so good what was their secret generally success
i mean what led to success what do you mean like
you know one of the most good knights was william marshall and he gained huge um fame from winning
many uh tournaments you know talk like uh just and all that stuff um but as to active uh service
in large in large wars and stuff he had some military service early on but not to the scale
let's say richard the lion heart and if you want to look at some of the things that um certain
kings who were lauded at being very noble and chivalrous some of the things they actually did
in in warfare by the romantic view of chivalry they would seem like massive villains richard
the lion heart executed a few hundred prisoners or so because saladin um was stalling and didn't
pay certain ransoms and so because the ransom weren't paid yeah he executed them all uh might
not seem very chivalrous i knights and especially kings when it came to warfare were actually farm
war uh pragmatists than they were you know i shall not fight uh you know uh on unfair grounds and
stuff like that you know uh they uh were warriors first and foremost and they did adhere to the
things that they felt were chivalrous but and also generally their their direct society but
kings more so than anyone else had the power to go against the grain and do whatever the hell they
wanted because not many people are going to challenge them did you know that sorry richard
the lion hearted was gay fun fact was that rax king richard the lion hearted was gay
so it was stumbled on can we can we go back to king of thrones and how terrible episode three was
hey hey republican man what what did you think about the trebuchet has been at the front of the
lines what do you think about that i think that gives you the maximum distance to bombard the
enemy before they close with you and so that's the best place to put them then then right just
how long does it take to reload a trebuchet i would estimate around 30 seconds somewhere around
there 30 seconds and how long does it take to readjust where a trebuchet is being aimed at
like in terms of the uh the range because the range is determined by the counterweight and
so the weights that you put in the counterweight on the trebuchet and so if you are facing an army
that's charging you and that means their position is in a constant state of flux because they are
charging you you're only going to get one shot of the trebuchet and so you have to reconfigure the
whole setup to try and figure out where the enemy is in already and by that time the enemy will have
engaged you do realize trebuchet is rarely ever used by a defending army historically they were
mostly always used by a besieging army usually against fortifications a castle the main reason
why castles don't move well i mean i know that they were mostly used to bust walls but i guess
so in defense against an attacking army rarely ever used okay and if you did use them
well one you would most definitely want to put them behind a protective wall otherwise
they're just destroyed i guess a good example a good example would be the battle of um the battle
of um what minister where they where both um both the orcs were using trebuchets to try and um
break sort of the castle defenses and they were using trebuchets against a giant army but they
didn't put the trebuchets in the field because like if you put them in the field then it's like
a couple minutes and then they're gone by the way they were all sorry and catapults in the long
night yeah right yeah i have another whole video on catapults that catapults were not employed
nearly to the level that people assume in medieval combat um you know the trebuchet meme it truly is
the more superior siege weapon and also just to your point about putting the trebuchets out in
the front yeah how far out in front of the walls was it like only was it 50 meters i don't think
because you can see i think you can see the castle like in the frame as well yeah so sorry
the dead are afraid of fire so this is the thing so that if you're putting the trebuchet
what 50 meters in front of the castle walls and the dead how long would it take them to
charge over 50 meters probably like 10 seconds 10 seconds 50 meters that's let's say 45 seconds
i mean that's pretty slow man i think like
with the length of time that it takes to reload it trebuchet especially just one thing the zombies
are very fast i want to clarify yes and with the length of time it takes to reload a trebuchet
and by the fact you would need to recalibrate it so it would be shooting at a shorter distance
by removing things from the counterweight you wouldn't get an additional shot off by moving
it forward by 50 meters the few seconds that you're gaining won't do a thing you would still
get the same amount of shots from the trebuchet whether it's in front forward like that or behind
the walls i mean i guess the question um republican is like if you in the battle i'm i keep
referencing fantasy battles but like in the battle of homes deep they didn't put like anything in
front of the wall because like the wall they were gonna reach the wall eventually so anybody
that you put there is dead they couldn't stand on the terrain in front of me well yeah so do you are
you leading me to believe that if it could stand there they would have put it there i mean possibly
you think they would have though like you really think that and i don't know what the rules of the
lord of the rings universe what does it matter it doesn't matter what a kill of it like i don't
know if tulkian was quite as versed in medieval things as george's decision to put the trebuchets
forward like that it was a show right because george is pretty well versed in medieval stuff
for he's died out in front of him not like that do you guys the other thing is the show runners
just like totally did what they wanted yes yes yes how would they get away with that once he
publishes the book though because there's no way they don't give a shit you think season eight is
the first time they deviated from the books it's not i've never read the books but i i mean this
did you know did you know did you know that the show is ahead of the books right now
so they've definitely deviated from the books then because the books don't exist
but i imagine they still have an outline to work from and they're probably following it
because they know how dedicated game of thrones fans are to keeping yeah they figured that out
really oh hang on hang on hang on hang just sorry your argument was how would they get away with it
they haven't got away with what they did do like they haven't that's everybody's really
everybody's really annoyed yeah like season eight is gonna go down in the anals of history as
yes possibly the worst media that ever fucking goes shattered to our tv screens
if you guys think that's the worst thing that's ever happened i have to wonder if you guys have
ever seen things like the funky phantom um in reference to how it started it is the worst yes
it is among the worst it is certainly in turn control relevance in significance and its
popularity it is definitely like the uh the perspective right because it's it's the final
season of a show that was widely regarded to be a very high quality and yet it's so amateurously
written like i mean you've already conceded the cavalry point i'm not sure why you're still
arguing about the trebuchets and the battle of helms deep was happening that they would put the
trebuchets in front of the wall well just from the things i mentioned you would concede that
putting the trebuchets forward like that is just retarded like it's never done historically and the
fact that they didn't the show was just stupid i love you shadow but do we do we know with 100
certainty that trebuchets work the same way in game of thrones they work what how would they
work it in differently they have fantasy they're showing us a trebuche the assumption is yeah you
you got but like gravity works the same way in game it was it was a counterweight trebuchets
they showed it as a counterweight trebuchets with no deviation from the historical visions
r2 the point that we're that one of the big issues here is that you want to protect your
siege equipment for as long as you can so that they have enough time to continuously fire at the
enemy it's not how it works it's what it does and it showed it i assume i've not seen it it showed
doing the same thing that a trebuchet does that's how everyone knows it's the trebuchet and even in
the show if we if we look at the assumptions we've made i mean obviously the dead they just make
attacks they don't defend they have no castle so you can use your trebuchets you can sacrifice them
if you want to what good or that do you or you could keep them behind the walls and use them
multiple times i mean even in the show they only get one shot off before the dead overrun them
don't they i mean any battle that would be considered a complete imagine you had an m1
abrams and it got blown up after firing one shot it's like well shit that's like 20 million
dollars down the trade and shad um i looked this up real quick maybe you can confirm someone asked
what is the rate of fire of a typical typical medieval counterweight trebuchet this gentleman
says that the larger counterweight has a record load time of four minutes and 20 seconds load
420 that sounds about right that right so they'll get one shot maybe yeah no no video games can help
us contextualize this a bit better but four minutes and 20 seconds is an eternity in a battle every
second yeah with a charging enemy with the uh with the length of time it took for the dead to close
the distance uh they and it's funny because out of all the mistakes they made in that show
the fact that the trebuchet has only got one shot off before the dead close the distance does sound
want to be one of the only accurate things which just goes to emphasize the point even more
that if you were going to use them you would put put them behind the bloody walls of your castle
shad what about the um putting your men outside of the castle walls well even that is stupid as well
like the amount of spare like in my review i said if they had any spare space inside the castle
there should be filled up with you know those men armed with they have tons of space they had tons
of space in there it was it was i was shocked at how much space was inside the castle after
the dead actually got inside i couldn't believe it they should have loaded up that castle shoulder
shoulder with their soldiers obsidian tipped arrows even fires whatever as many as they could
and it and then if they couldn't fit everyone in after they loaded up it up as much as possible
you wouldn't position your military in front of the castle you would put it to the flanks the
sides of the castle and get them or sorry you would get the army the dead to hit the castle
forward front on smack them against the walls and then you would close in with the infantry
on the sides and flank them in that in and then if they start to actually focus on the infantry
instead of the castle you'd get the infantry to retreat move around the castle get the dead to
follow them while the defenders on the walls of the castle just ping them off okay and and that's
how you would work it and so the dead they could that would either force the army they're dead to
split their forces to focus on the infantry in the castle at the same uh same time or they would um
commit all their forces to attacking the castle all the infantry and if they're doing that when
the army of the dead is attacking the castle you get the infantry to smack them and then if the army
of the dead is attacking the infantry you get the castle to smack them like that like cavalry could
come in handy in a situation like that once or twice absolutely because as soon as you have you
know the army they're dead engage with something okay you then bring in the heavy cavalry to do a
massive uh shock impact on their flanks okay because that's not that those are the positions
in which they're not ready to receive an attack on and the cavalry would be employed to a much
much better degree but with the dothraki because they like cavalry you don't send light cavalry
into the ranks of your enemy okay you use them to harry the enemy because they got swords you run
up on the sides slash and then withdraw and then run in again okay you don't charge in unless
they're dedicated heavy cavalry there's one problem with the scenario you're painting though
and that's that they don't have enough provisions to maintain everybody within the fort so if they
all get in the walls then they're just gonna be starved out how how many provisions did they have
did the army of the dead wait to starve them out oh but they could the night king could just
be like all these guys fucked up they're cut off they didn't also where are you drawing information
that they didn't but also where where's your information that they didn't have enough provisions
you just moved a massive number of men to a single point in a short period of time
don't don't you think they would only do that if they had the supplies to do it though
doesn't that make more sense well no here's here's the bigger fundamental problem like
they obviously have enough food for everybody there because they're all there like what what
are you suggesting that when you put them outside they don't have to eat and drink
like that's just gonna step over fly lines open to the south where you can import more food
so what's that why does that change if they're outside the walls because if they're not they
don't have a supply line that they're telling me why would they just leave them but they can
what what's the winner from leaving the castle so so a couple of things okay um if the army of the
dead didn't attack that would have worked in their favor because they got two dragons that they can
just go in destroy them and hopefully draw out their dragon then draw them back to the castle
take out the dragon but the fact i was annoyed that the dragons weren't used nearly to the level
that they could have been because they were massively effective um and you know you could
say oh but the night king and his glances and stuff like that is like yeah that's very
convenient to the plot he's only good at it when he needs to be and stuff like that but it's not
necessarily um the win move for the army the dead so wait there wasn't there wasn't really
much indication in the show to say that they would wait but having said that waiting is still
a good strategy that's what the whole point of a siege is is to starve them out but it almost
seems like the army of the dead wouldn't have been doing that they were marching forward they wanted
to penetrate deeper into westeros and to do that they needed to get past winterfell i didn't see
much indication that they had that level of patience well yeah because if the idea is that
they could go around winterfell then why even like battle them there just like go around
i mean that would be an idea to draw them out of their board but surely it's not an idea to go
around because they had to go through you see when you have a castle if you have the supplies
and there seems to be plenty of indication that they did waiting actually it goes in your favor
because it gives you time to rally more defenses game of thrones lawman here they want to kill
bran that's their main goal bran is hidden inside the castle they assaulting the castle
to kill bran they're not gonna wait them out then no they're not gonna wait whatsoever they're
gonna assault as soon as possible well there you go i mean do we know for a fact that their main
goal was brandy because we know yes yes we do yes the final scene where they all crowd around bran
while the night king waits to execute himself that was their only goal they didn't care about
anything else they were going to kill everything in their way but they just not attack the garden
directly then exactly you're just highlighting even more issues with this show yeah the the
godswood should actually be behind inside all they need to do is have the dragon do a suicide run
i actually have another whole video on how winterfell should look according to the books
there you go another deviation as well from the shows um and the books all i'm looking for
r2 is that uh you'd agree that it's not very well written episode 3 of season 8 of game of thrones
what do you think yeah i thought it was pretty well written but has has shadowversity changed
your mind whatsoever i mean he he showed me that there are differences between real medieval war
and game of thrones can you tell me why those wouldn't apply to game of thrones wow i mean i
mean i don't think it necessarily makes the story bad because the story is primarily about story
arcs which i guess you guys must not have watched a more recent video on story arcs because the
story arcs but with a k yes that video right sure i mean so okay i spelled arc wrong you got me on
that but um i already admitted that um hang on but the the combat the fighting the these strong
points of conflict they create and are a part an integral part of the story arc overall
you just can't separate them they absolutely are because like the vehicle of storytelling
rather than yeah and they're a faulty vehicle they're a flawed vehicle
so like imagine imagine i don't know imagine that a story is like a car
or the story is you know like the beginning and end of a road and the car is like the vehicle
for the story so the plot is like the chassis um i don't know the characters of the wheel
like let's say the world is the wheels so every time you get something wrong you basically
slashing the tires of that car and making it harder and harder to get to the end point
like in a smooth good way yeah it gets bumpier it starts to drag specific characters though
i mean i actually no no no everything everything is part of it you can't you can't compartmentalize
it you can prioritize what you think is more important for sure but like the world is really
important especially in speculative fiction if how you arrive at your theme or goal or purpose
whatever you're trying to achieve in a story if if you arrive at that using means that are
nonsensical contradictory have plot holes in them are inconsistent then that is bad storytelling
you just want the reward without putting in the work and without making the effort to have it all
makes sense like what if like what if um if you needed to have the good guys win in the battle of
winter fell they were just about to lose but then the fucking marines arrive in their tanks
in their m16s and they blow away all of the undead and they save the castle oh we got our we got our
arc finished for the characters we we won the battle we saved the day but how we got there was
completely nonsensical i guess that would change all the game of thrones into a comedy
oh i yeah a lot of people been laughing at it for certain but it would ruin the story yeah
like a world should abide by its own rules and its own internal logic same thing with star wars and
war hammer and mass fact and every fictional world has a grounding in some set of rules that it
follows that helps establish stakes that helps let the audience know that not literally everything
is possible even harry potter has rules and that is that's the big thing right is making sure that
people know that not everything is possible like that there won't be any that i mean there's no
stories stories yeah exactly because stories are built on expectations to some extent and that
means like even if the story does something that you didn't expect it has a logical through line
so that there you know it would be reasonable for you to expect that whereas like it would be
unreasonable for me to expect that if i were watching episode nine that palpatine wasn't dead
and he's actually coming back and he's gonna fight ray and that's gonna be the end of the series
i mean i don't i i don't know what will happen in episode nine i don't think anyone does but
yeah we do i think we know what's gonna happen i think we know exactly what's gonna happen yeah
the leaks have been extensive and ongoing uh to a degree i've never seen before yeah it's kind of
unbelievable yeah it is legitimately interesting do you think it's all just a big fake out by disney
why would they have to get out what do you mean i mean do you think they're just trying to get one
over on the fans by why can i okay i'm gonna i'm gonna use my host powers here i feel like the
conversation has reached a natural end i want to i want to refocus the stream as to what it was
originally intended to i appreciate the discussion with both shadiversity and remarkable republican
but i was going to say yes yes yeah i don't know if you're going to dismiss him or so we can get
along but he asked you asked us to ask him the episode nine question i will do that okay uh
remarkable republican who do you think and i i'm going to rephrase this question because i don't
exactly know how you feel about star wars who do you think is it going to be the character that's
treated the worst in terms of consistency in episode nine who do you think is the character
that will fail to live up to who they are intrinsically with what we understand about
them uh in episode nine from what we understand and this is based on absolutely anything who do
you think palpatine comes back it'll be him because oh shit we disqualified palpatine yeah
oh yeah this was this poll we're keeping track we just want to see who gets it right so before
we began we didn't know that palpatine was going to be in this one so we've disqualified palpatine
and i think lando yes lando was disqualified just give us your top three i guess and then
we'll be able to tell you sort of how it works out well i guess no matter what ray does it isn't
really a surprise at this point because she kind of just does whatever um fin has been super
inconsistent but i don't uh the asian lady their buddy hated um they'll probably make her do
something that makes no sense again uh if lee is in the movie at all i mean that when it makes sense
i don't know if she's in a lot of it why why would you know that jab the moment
hurts the emotions more of the film who do you think will be the one the street of the
ways go for it worst okay that i'm not going with kylo ren all right because i think we disqualified
him too you got to pick someone else okay all right um poe dameron all right that's fair there
you go what's your reasoning for poe dameron out of curiosity i couldn't choose kylo or palpatine but
also um they just made him in the last episode they kind of emasculated him so i don't know what
he's going to do now but it won't be something that you would expect out of a fighter pilot it'll
probably be something really dumb yeah all right thing um and ours about feelings or something
yes uh fair enough there you go uh every every person who comes on efap and is considered a
relatively full-time guest is is given a chance to answer this question so uh thank you for giving
your input uh is there anything else you'd like to say before you uh you hop out um not really
just uh thanks for having me on uh had fun talking to you guys um subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already yeah yeah uh remarkable republican you can find him on youtube he makes a lot of
videos about game of thrones and assorted other medias it was good to meet you mate um uh i know
there's a bit of a strange way to meet and everything i just enjoy a good you know healthy
debate so sorry if i come off a bit aggressive at times but i'm just just like excellent good to
meet you chef yeah good to meet you too man because uh it's just i don't mean to rush just
that we've got a uh i get you an intention with this stream so yeah uh thanks for coming on my
good man and uh perhaps we shall see you in the distant future all right well have a good night
guys thank you bye bye bye bye i haven't had a headache that intense since the first time we
covered bob i enjoyed that immensely i love that thank you very much for shad for uh coming on
thank you hi so that was yeah hooray that was everything i thought it would be
so we have like 40 minutes of wolf remaining i believe which means we're gonna have to speed
through some memes and then uh i'll have to figure out how i'm gonna i'm gonna work the rest of this
all right but until then we're just gonna look at memes as little tangents as possible people okay
i never tangent so i don't have to worry about anything but all of you guys oh terrible the
tangents are what the fun is about i don't know what you mean so we're gonna start with me me and
rags did an efap mini that was like three hours i think and i i like this meme you are live but
we've not crannied the title of efap that one was great love it um oh shit i think we've done that
one all right oh i'm gonna be posting away here i think this is just something that exists
and someone took a photo of it but big idiots is no he he connected the g in the eye oh yeah he
connected it so now it's big idiots i love it that's very good good on you excellent work
you got um all i want for christmas is jay to watch lord the rings jay are you getting
around to that or what uh yeah yeah i'll get around to that one year
here rags i think you'll like this one
uh objectively good spoonaman oh my god i thought that was his leg race to the side
of our second yeah i heard like two total has indeed risen with the monthly thrust and
yeah just you know again if anyone doesn't know totals video woke style is actually pretty good
it's honestly not even that bad it's a shame he didn't really know it woke me
you know so rags are free he'll appreciate the shit out of this would you bring me
i miss jacob i want to see what he's slabbing these days i don't care about these new shitty
characters i want the old shitty character yeah we've come to learn so much about jacob
so this is the battle the endless battle of themes and objectivity of course
oh someone just reminded me i do have questions for shad unfortunately i do not have time to share
with him those questions he will address those i imagine on uh whatever the next stream he comes
on oh once once wolf is uh gonna gonna poop off sort of thing we'll get shad his questions if
if that makes sense i'll try and hang around jay what do you have to say about this
oh what do i have to say about there is no reason not to jay get away from the rhino and put
those jars down you have a problem at least you know i feel like you'll agree that yeah i was
gonna say you'll you'll probably take it more seriously when it's in meme form so it shouldn't
it shouldn't say jay get away from that rhino it should say whoever you are true unless you have
a name tag or something but yeah this is i'm wondering who who took this picture obviously
it was rags obviously this is um this is obviously addressing arch's story in that
20 minutes that we had him and sargon on but how i think someone else got banned
because of arch with a profile that matched his name wasn't that the story
i guess the only person who could address that is probably rags
all right
this is foreshadowing of what's going to happen soon enough
rise of skyward it's less than a week away you know you've converted me i did not want to see
this piece of trash but now i seriously i was like train wreck bring it on
if you haven't seen some of the leaks for this thing it is have you seen the leak stream
yeah yeah like the leaks have just been getting me more and more
excited for it it's like this is just getting worse and worse and it's going to be glorious
i cannot like it this is a good meme is this an e-fat meme or just well i was going to say
how relevant this meme is considering um everything wonderful oh my god i'm opening
oh my god it works perfectly
we never even got to talk about the martian theocracy
or the gay butler or or taiwan oh i know oh my god so many questions so i'd love to poke his brain
for an hour or two or three so this is the problem a 12 hours is too small how are we
supposed to fit a full podcast into 12 hours i ask you i don't even know what this meme is exactly
i love it double speed is that ray trying to kill baby yoda i don't really know it's okay no
something's going on here i don't know the baby yoda is okay with it ray seems to be
downright aggressive you know it's my interpretation i have not seen the film that this is from
what is the film this is from it's picks all right oh yeah this is uh moana moana i've not seen it
you've not seen the kids if you have kids you can't avoid seeing it stop it jay you can't
i thought one was not fine no shad likes to watch him alone by himself and he just uses having kids
cover it's my favorite i don't know why i'm using the movie was trash i'm just saying oh i've heard
that that controversial thing or is that the normal thing i don't know i don't know i've heard
it's not good i don't know exactly what this is but um like what game i guess uh city of heroes
or something one of the few long men remaining in the universe tunnel created the long meant
to counterbalance idiocracy they existed since the beginning of time but most were wiped out
by the sheer stubbornness of idiots he's approximately 1.2 billion years old and uses
psychic powers to aid him in argumentation both defending good films such as joker and deconstructing
bad films the last jedi his nemesis changes from time to time at one point being the powerful
quinton and at another being the charismatic patrick why does why are there lies powerful
and charismatic really i don't know uh but none compared to the speed of diabeto mauler's two
closest confidants are the very charismatic doggo rags see that's accurate and the very enraged
canine the dishonored wolf together they have defeated many enemies and even converted some
into allies such as the quite kickable jay xe who had once tried to slander the long man but
was stopped by rhino milk and now aids them in their quest to find good rat
and then i guess we have one for uh have this asked yeah this is the don the don was once a
normal man who enjoyed motorcycles but while his wife was on her death bed she told him that he
should try to smile upon her death the dawn set out to make the world a better place by giving
to charities volunteering at homeless shelters and even overcame orphan love adopting many children
into his home not even the heartless captain marvel who stole his bike and jacket after seriously
injuring his hand could stop him instead this only reassured the don that people like her needed to
be balanced by good men like himself after seeing the goodness that the don was capable of tonald
had a meeting with jeff the cosmic chicken and they agreed that they should give don the angelic
powers so that he would be more effective at making the world a better place so it was said
blessed be the don and he was made into an angel blessed by tonald and the cosmic chicken
look at that stunned into silence all of you i don't know if the actor who played the don
like watched efap i know right just like totally lost rise of mauler am i gonna have to kill ray
i'm not exactly against it i'm just asking that would be a privilege and you do wear a mask so
you fit quite nicely in there that's a good one god i guess you disagree
oh massive mauler and the gargantuan gay
fabricated fortification of fire i like that tonald is um gandalf the holy beast i like that
i like talking about dumbledore what the hell
gandalf what the fuck did that come helix
uh first froydian and now this yeah i like the alliteration on the uh you should all be like
you know instead of our barriers of blockage people say artificial everything it should be
should be alliterating i think that's better thank god um when the mauls tell you efap is
live while you're asleep how many other lies have i been told by the council i have not seen
clone wars but i'm sure that's what that's from so this is um just just your standard meme
brown table does feel that touching a book is sexual harassment oh yeah which means captain
marvel is a thingy event oh this is like someone doing possibly an exam they decided to draw the
long man on their book that was a full there's a full name on there yes i mean well what is this
probably several people with that name i don't know eric bucella is that eric butts's like
they were so bored with their exam they drew me twice
too long for me
yes even i am spooked by uh the long is that exam written in comic sense possibly it is
it is that's how you know it's a legit exam commissar mauler i've got the don bringer as a glove
very cool commissar this is actually a detailed rendition of shinobi of all things
check it out got the jurassic park belt defending what could be a velociraptor
very very cool
good old shinobi shinobi this is um mauler in anime form i believe there is a wolf
version of this as well that i hopefully can get to whoa the legendary longoid
i love the word longoid it strikes terror to many of my enemies
i get um so i don't know exactly what the context of this is i think it's plague creations is next
animation but i'm the pope or at least some kind i think it's a reference to future armor i can't
remember um space pope is it space pope i think it might be space pope oh yeah actually that sounds
right space pope that's such a feature let me look at it um images
no space pope is closed but it's the alligator remember oh yes reptilian oh yeah the garfish
fun effects yes garfish are not reptiles though do you have a fish oh shad oh oh wait no he's
he's no no no i'm here i'm just i i meet myself so there's not so much background noise all right
now help me out here because before i was like i ate garfish and they didn't even know what it was
you know what garfish is right oh yeah totally just cheating he's australian i've never heard
exactly he's from your fictional country too it doesn't count yeah it's it's a fictional animal
for a fictional country no no no they're not as bad as the drop bears though so you've got to be
drop bears yeah what you you've never heard of drop bears
what is that i feel like they're playing us now are they paratrooper bears is that what that is
no no no paratrooper bears yeah fringy no no there's smaller than koalas and there are
there are cousin to koalas but they have these massive claws okay and they actually they uh
they're the form of attack or oh jesus is that they let go of the the the trees and they jump
down and their claws they just like flay there they're praying oh my god what's wrong with your
country why are there so many holes in everything they're they're out there man they have a wiki
for australia they're like yeah no like for the drop bears they're like the snipes i know what
they're exactly like the snipes you have to be oh yeah the snipes old dude people
you know how in like the um you know 10 or 15 years ago you used to buy strategy
guides for video games i feel like you need a strategy guide for this country if you're a tourist
is it like google drop
there
the guy is like do i be afraid or do i love
drop bears
those hot bears are great you know that oh look at the plot thickens there's a bigger rib hang on
this is real this is a real picture it's not a
they're rescuing a bear from a tree of course it's real it's not a photo
i just saw that and i see it was like a meme or some shit it's a drop bear did you not
the bear couldn't get down from the tree by itself
well it could it was doing it there it's just you know how did it get up if it couldn't get
back it is harder to climb down trees than it is it reminds me of like you know when you're a
kid you climbed up a tree it's like mom i'm scared it's like when you got up there you might
know how to get down help me like it is harder to climb down something than it is to climb up
lies yeah i don't know that i was a big climber as a kid i still time sometimes
it's a lot easier to climb down the stairs than it is to climb up yeah oh sorry i forget
when somebody likes you oh anyway i guess we should go to next i was just gonna say by the
way this koala don't mean to drop i'll be right back guys it's okay the first thing you posted
for drop is j it just seems like like a sith lord version of a koala like if normal koala
it is jedi these would be the sith version the very very real animal yes also the bottom line
of the lord of rings style one or harry parlour i don't know i said i just glanced at the cover
and now i have fucking aids then that's a quote from tywin lannister just wanted to make sure we
got that got um say he's old again say he's old again i dig double day motherfucker
not so great debate where it all began kind of sort of not really but sort of i like this image
even through pr in there i look beautiful how do you think this was made
oh that would have been drawn probably in paint
i wonder if it's like like photoshop oh like a really good programmer they're like oh paid oh okay
it looks more about something because it's got shading and stuff so it can't be
you're the one who said paid well yeah but the thing is is like i got betrayed thanks dickhead
um yeah the thing is
no but the thing is you can do some really good stuff in paint so i wouldn't take it as like an
indictment against you i would like you can do a lot like i don't know what to tell you i saw a
video where someone did like a photo realistic drawing in paint yeah but that's but that's why
it's impressive because you because because of paint like you wouldn't see a photo realistic
drawing i go oh that was probably not in paint that's why there's a that's why i saw that video
is that shad battling the welsh dragon what's going on there
well you've got a you've got the isle of man in your eye i do jay is looking to spank a rhino
fair enough that's uh that's my daily routine spank the rhino every day we got a mcmuffin you're
about to stick your finger up his butt again well that's how i know look all that rhino squirt and
something oh my god i always make the rhino squirt apparently you're milking them the spider saw
all of this is that is that an angel mcmuffin oh this was so the context was this was how people
see baller who like don't like my stuff i don't like the women's this one i mean what can you say
right what can you say about this we are content parasites terrified you might even say that efab
is like the tracing paper of the art world do they know about oh oh i get it moving on he has a
pikachu toy wait hang up before i say something do they know about that or not they do not moving
on there's a pikachu okay look how adorable that is you know i just i just want to mention that is
sometimes uh you're not what how did i phrase it before i wonder
also that is portion two complete we're onto portion three of the efap memes
why do you serve your efap memes in portion because jay your why do you want to we don't
be careful you do not get addicted to me i just want fishy chips now look at this crap
what the fuck we watched it we watched a terrible horrible awful tlj because video
and they had these weird graphs that don't make any sense try to explain the balance before
remember what i said she she goes to the mirror and just goes lol no parents
oh right i just want to you know just just so everyone's clear uh you know maybe it's not
capitalizing on your criticizing shitty takes just just so you know 100 percent just i just think it's
a general knowledge general thing that we should you know reviewing a piece of media like uh you
know star wars or something would be capitalizing on star wars yeah tracing paper um yes if you were
around 12 hours ago you'd know that this is representative of the video we watched where
the defense of the tlj movie is is quite intense they draw lots of formulas and tisms all over the
place oh we got another vision of
what's the mean there why is it mood face that's the icon of the guy oh okay
we shall go onto the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the season with oceans we shall
fight with the growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island
of whatever the cost may be when it's what the fuck you're doing resisting the nuts oh you want
to read it go ahead yeah i'll read it winson what the fuck are you doing resisting the nazis
is pointless if they'll rise up again if we defeat them there's no point in delaying the inevitable
oh shit fam you're right there's no point they'll just rise up again break out the swastikas boys
are becoming nazis yeah for context uh the the argument was that what's the point in
re-establishing the jedi when the sith are just going to eventually win oh so just give up
basically yeah that's just that's not an argument
shut up jay jab's giving
oh that was that was the fucking thumbnail from wolf stream wasn't it it was i had to show it
so this was me being like you can't present an opposing opinion so instead i'm gonna drop a
pamphlet with an opposing opinion i'll be like oh look a pamphlet it's got nothing to do with me
but why don't you open it read what's inside i'm gonna go over here now
i like that i'm long in this rendition too oh god another one i didn't realize how many we had
of these look at this i like how they're all slightly different they're increasing with
quality every time true wow that's taken are they still around the jab jabs jib jab i don't know
jib jab official site oh fucking hell look at this fresh meme they are still around jib jabs
around rags look at your fresh meme may come to life well they say like luke threw his lightsabers
so that means it's completely consistent rags like throwing something in the litter throwing
a live grenade it's the same thing oh does someone actually make that argument where he
threw it in the ot that means it's consistent yes what do you mean everyone fucking says that
who loves tl i've never seen that in a video before i've just loved it the visual rendition
is someone throwing a grenade at a smiling child he thinks he's candy candy apple that sort of thing
so i'm in a game apparently i don't know which one this is but i like it oh my god a large axe
this is i guess what it's like trying to cover movie pop videos
the x i think that's from dc heroes online really i think so too actually what an obscure reference
that is this indiana jones photoshoot absurdly good it really is look at the gas mask great he's
holding a copy of joker too oh shit i didn't even notice the gas mask yeah
oh
oh shit another fresh meme so uh tonaled referenced liquid heat i'm not sure what that is
i think golem was killed by liquid you can cook carrots with liquid heat
i don't i don't how did this happen i think i got this from our actual chat what does it mean
that's just something i found on uh it's too complicated wonderful and what does it mean
well what does it mean i don't know it doesn't matter how how it doesn't matter how much the
sequels will try they'll never surpass the love oh my god so what actually did it they won't
this is alien isolation yeah yeah tonaled hiding from the steamed carrot
yeah he says cooked carrots are terrible he hates carrots
i can't say he was wrong they're fine i like cooked carrots are fine i don't like them raw
at all i hate cooked they're fine i don't like them raw either i think you have to cook them
you guys are weird you're from literally a make believe country
uh where are we going next oh after four hours of cinema roberto he's a sad longman
oh crap oh we win that's okay
i thought fringy was upset that i was upset in this picture i am a little bit upset that makes
me sad yeah this is sad fiction sad man bad this is another attempt at renditioning tonaled
ongoing war with cooked carrots that's a weird one oh hey look at this combo of old memes and well
i can hear it in kylo ren's voice too it's gonna be okay
it hurt oh we looked at that one
this was this is representative of how many straw men he totally destroyed in his video
it was great there were several arguments including but not limited to i wanted luke
to be super gary stew man and destroy everything don't you see person that's not good
that is not good and yet he he argued at one point that what people wanted was for snoke to
randomly just start reading out a wikipedia page about his history you know those how many people
have you guys met who absolutely have those arguments i'm just racking my mind because there
are so many yeah it's kind of hard to sort of put a thing not here poe mutes layer then
thing here therefore poe summoned things which led to unnecessary death poe man bad
that's how it works i guess there's nothing else to consider poe man bad um no you saved the entire
anyway oh check it out so you guys have seen uh fuck what's the name of this one this is pixar
as well right coco oh yeah i love coco oh so good that is a good one love it's playing me a song
he is and look who else is in attendance yay how wonderful oh um i'm not 100 sure what's going
on here fringy you want to figure this out i don't know um i have no idea rags are screaming
i am screaming fringy is trying to hold the floor in some way jumping up in the air i i don't know it
looks like i'm a woman as well no you're the plague doctor scp that's the scp logo on the wall
okay all right i think you are right okay right okay i suppose that makes sense
all right this is uh some fan art of me that's pretty damn cool i have to put this in the fan
art section at some point oh that's that's neat that's really cool i like the the gas mask portions
are now exhausts assassin spring who do you think is the person who's saying fuck
uh it's too small to be bob
it looks like you're groin oh your groin is just saying fuck well yeah for some reason
my hey my groin is always telling so that that makes sense this is a wolf commenting that
he seemed to be wearing a dress trans dad
hand solo just couldn't fucking accept it what a piece of shit
and so he was killed for his bigotry as is appropriate this is uh my mother made of knives
falling on me and giving me scars my knife mom in your baby yoda yes it makes sense
it's racist uh and then we got you know that was a racist dog whistle i confirmed that wasn't
a dog whistle and then mark brown says you can cook a carrot like a grenade and that upset tonals
oh my goodness what are we dealing with here i think so he said like you know uh luke uh sort
of attacked kyla while he was sleeping did luke do that to vader the answer is yes
oh look at vader he's all happy having his little sleepy sleeps
oh i don't have cozy sleeps yes the epic music was playing and it like you know the battle's
over in two seconds he just has a lightsaber in his head i was still playing and he's there like
rose tico answering the call to adventure oh very cute how uh wait that's that's the dora thing
right how many such and such is here and then she pauses for a second while you answer i actually
you gotta no matter what comes through that gate you'll stand your ground let's look at the themes
runs whatever themes get brought up in videos we're always like oh god here we go
oh what do you think this is specifically what do we reckon
uh kylo is it none is it like a play on the whole kylo dress link dress thing
oh why than a nun get up on him why not a nun
uh
vader would sweat after realizing he's made this enemies that he kills more powerful than
they could possibly imagine
waiting for toxic last jedi haters to lash out of me day one day
two day seven thousand five hundred and sixty seven well i mean he's patient
i like the little poised by the door as well like they're in cover
more the seconds are starting super chats youtube here's is truck one out of 64 good luck
i don't think we've ever had a mr b meme have we
oh man maybe they're few and far between oh a surprise to be sure of a welcome one this is
when we when we were told in the video that it's truly george lucas's fault that luke was a coward
oh now we get tired of those ones uh i i heard today apparently that um
like george lucas flat out said that palpatine wouldn't have been in his episode nine
yeah yeah well i mean
like yes obviously but this was planned from the very start
yeah when he said that kylo was confused but he still committed to the dark side lights i was like
hey he was like no this is uh me saying that i was totally on board with seeing a scene where luke
just slashed through a bunch of rebels for no reason i'm on board with this context pending
oh we actually went through that one all good what is this
i stick my life on it abe lincoln about the monthly thrust i'm i don't know i said i swore
on abraham lincoln's grave that i did and i did i swear that i did you can trust me
oh i guess this was i sent it as a patreon message so this is mauler getting googled mauler is gay
go pink mauler is short that's offensive mauler is the alien is gay
mauler didn't kill himself
mauler is the alien he didn't kill himself i like these these are really
what are the google suggestions if you type in mauler i don't is it terrible
wow someone pull up a google tab let's find out twitter my mother falling on me made of knives
um i yeah nothing have to do got the isle of man is good rat i think i may have shown
this one already but it's important to to repeat that it is good rat
um it seems i think this is a combo of something that exists already
but his repurpose you got this is his last that is his last he's doing his job then he goes
that's why i'll become that pillar he's the number one hero the symbol of peace i
is there any reason why i'm just there randomly uh because you're on the team
fringy whether or not oh okay i mean i'm not there but yeah that's what i mean
google it i googled it oh yeah he said the he said the layer would survive and he googled it
layer would have said we googled the exact same thing that he did and he left out some
important information i'm not sure what to make of this one
i guess jack saint is back and rags is rags is preparing with a knife i don't know what's jack
been doing i don't know he made a video about skyla white recently i saw that that's where that is
that's where you can bring back you got oh you haven't seen breaking bad then it's me as an
animu grill wow that's terrible i think it's wonderful and that you're a dirty liar
i'm a clean liar okay fine you're a clean liar i love it on the laptop that is
see this is ridiculous why would i fear chat some of these memes i don't even understand
yeah because it knows your secrets you know what yeah i've done this one though
they took the kids they took his keys he's gonna get the back directed by liam neeson
the sard conure oh liam neeson starring conuree it's a stod stared it's a stare
yeah stared man by conuree my brain is trying to fill in the correct things
ig and it makes sense fuck you care jay translate this uh why am i what um
i i don't know no wait jay thanks like the truth jay
jay nope this one like genuinely has me stopped i don't i like cheese i like cheese
explain chat wouldn't just make this up yeah they wouldn't do that um
maybe that's supposed to be ice cream not shit maybe because i like cheese and i like ice cream
is this maybe maybe that shit used to be cheese
yeah sounds like lies to me i think this last selection is goodbye memes
you i think we have a couple of lord the rings ones i i think i have a couple of meme videos
that are lord the rings related and i can't show them because of copyright systems but we will get
to them that's a good meme i think this is going to be an emote in the discord server
uh
i'm okay with that then we've got the many iterations you bow to no one oh even hue catman's there
it's an actual picture of you catman too
oh this is the one i was talking about see i got a wolf version
the greatest the greatest and weird
pizza and weird grapes up there i could seriously go for pizza right now
oh let's let's order a pizza i was kind of thinking about ordering a piece of tonight
i don't know which which spoon one is this uh sorry which one uh that is spoon and two
that's spoon and two okay so the good one the good as long as it's not spoon and three
yeah i don't know it's not the amazing spoon and two that's the thing what is this uh originally
um i don't know i like how rags is always a woman in these i like how new fap chat is a person
this i'm glad that the don attended my funeral absolutely
oh my god it's 7 30 a.m for me
i'm gonna have to hop out soon when the when the store's open to to go to the store
to buy cheese to buy cheese and poop what is the fucking difference jay really yeah jay
jay minary someone could actually just like manufacture a thing like that and make it
just just by sending in a meme that people will assume there's more context for
i think is efap supposed to be a character in this or is that just a logo that's attached
to the image i don't know i guess uh everybody's saying goodbye is efap all right i follow
oh hey i know this one this is fast and the furious yes oh this is good i like the
blare albeit rags it works for for sense of depth yeah depth of field yeah that's really this is a
really well put together one this is really great i don't like this one you guys get the
where the meme three two ones back was from the anime thing the anime one no neon genesis
evangelicalian oh oh i i had no idea now we got some some original drawings coming up
that's a good one hmm got a stick sweet is this is the stick of staff is it a reference to gundulf
or is it something else might just be a walking stick since i do want to hike do you have like a
stick at home that you really cherish that kind of looks like a family stick or i i can't is that
your family stick wolf is that your family wolf you have a family stick be honest every family
yes every family has a stick i've got my family stick right here family stick no i can't maybe
it's a dog's family family has a stick every every family has a stick this is a reference
to my ds2 series i believe this that's what the person posting it said on twitter it's quite nice
oh this is the tism guy he drew the tism wizard oh wow that was a cool pretty sweet drawing
i've got something dripping off my mask i assume it's estus because that's all it could be and
it's tears probably tears no estus i got oh i've got coming up all right i've got
i'm counting it coming out of my eyes too you've got cum coming out of yours yeah it's you know
it it happens are there any dogs that are allergic to dogs yes i let me google it
it's a sweet bit of fan art as well the many faces of catmen looks very aggressive
i think he's just how great he's mad at me for not feeding him i guess
feed mr catman i think you've seen a lot of these before because they're through twitter

because of course chris stuckman with two robot heads on the just above rags
ea and then just to those doomcock

like these two robot heads um those you could pretty easily manufacture robots right let me
look what i'm getting most out of this image is that mauler is just really tall everyone else is
really really small i mean it's the curse of the long man what can i say
i don't know if you've seen this or not this is uh one of bayouins

look at that that's lovely that's so good that is really good that landscape is really great
like yeah and this one is also i think you've seen this already as well i have not oh that's
farewell on a wolf a sheep in wolf's clothing or a wolf in wolf's clothing either way or a dude in
wolf's clothing yeah all right yeah thanks guys fuck you australian guy he was absolutely nothing
like a sheep so yeah but it's uh whatever all right
but yeah that's uh that's it for the memes i believe let me check i've got a few more that
are cycling in but it's kind of tough for me to get them without delaying for a while how much
time have you got wolf i i gotta go like now because i gotta be up in five hours to go
in that case what i'm gonna do right is begin reading the super chest once once you've left
but what i'm going to do is open a new notepad and pile every single thing that addresses you
into it and then when we record and this could be a while but it'll happen when we record the
remaining copyright related memes i will read out everything that's addressed to you and show you
any memes that address to you in that potential privatized recording thing that will be released
as a mini that does that how does that work yeah that works i'll be pretty busy for probably the
rest of those so you might not be able to record it until i late this month or early january
early january there you go guys besides i'm gonna need time to edit it anyway because of
copy tisms but um yeah that about seals the deal for your last efap um i don't know like i said
people have sent a lot of messages in super chats you will receive and respond to them um
it's gonna be i'm just gonna try and find a way to make sure i catalog everything so it's easier
for wolf to sort of uh see and respond to them like i said uh but other than that i suppose it's
uh it's been a wonderful journey we're up to what this is 65 right you almost hit order 66 wolf
you almost there gonna kill a whole bunch of jedi with us well i had to bail out because you know
i'm jedi true true but at least you got to see tonaled's first good video i know it's like this
is the best efap to end on because we get tonaled being good we get tlj defenders still being
horrible and then we got a ton of memes that had a bunch of callbacks to old memes it's it's like
the best callback episode absolutely it's been fucking great and they'll be available soon enough
once i i don't know when i'm gonna sleep sleeping is gay we're never gonna do it it's fine um
but yeah it's uh efap would not be the same without you sir thank you so much for uh being
with me and rags up to this point as well as the other gentlemen who have been on guests with you
as well it's been very fun as well as very meaningful we've made something really great
together and it wouldn't be the same without you yeah it's been fun and i i do want to say because
i i people thought this i i'm not stopping talking to all the efap related tisms and people
like i i'm just not going to be on twitter or youtube anymore i'm just cutting those out because
i don't feel like it's good for me mentally i i'm not gonna stop talking to mauler rags for
j shad and all them i'm still you know i'm not cutting my friends out of my life yeah we're
gonna watch uh avatar right yeah and the mandalorian no no like honestly it it gets really really bad
i think you know no no listen you'll you'll enjoy how bad it is rags this isn't making me
you will enjoy how bad it is just like you'll enjoy how terrible episode nine is
no the only thing i'm going to enjoy is ranting about it with other but much as i do
hey well you can do that yeah we can do that me and rags do it weekly with friggy and battle
we all just fucking rant about how terrible is gone yeah we do really just deteriorated so much
yeah uh i'll just before i go i'll say i started doing youtube when i was
teen so it's been eight years now across multiple different channels and uh yeah i i feel like i just
it some people can do it some people can't i'm clearly one of the people that can't and i need
to cut out things from my life that aren't good for me mentally so you know it's it's been fun
really like all the fun memories i've had and uh yeah doing nefap has been really fun too but time
to start doing something a little bit healthier for me absolutely and we've loved the time that
you've given uh and you can tell from chat you got you got a lot of love there too thank you
so much for uh everything and we're all hoping that you get you get what you're looking for with
whatever you choose to do next and um obviously this isn't goodbye from us because we're all
gonna hang out with you still i'm gonna make you i'm gonna make you watch more buffy and angel
because it's great yeah i still got video game-tisms to play and video or movies and shit to watch

sliding into the dms yeah we're always gonna be around yep absolutely we'll make sure to
have chats and shits about what we've been seeing and what we've been doing
play games or watch something together regularly like the mandalorian
yeah i gotta get going i gotta wait five hours again so uh it's been a while
been a wonderful 64 episode 65 episodes that makes sense what a journey one and a half years
just under that i think i don't even know anymore it's been a while it's been fun and uh i guess
from all of efap we love you you big tism and we'll catch you around yeah i hope you guys all
have continued success in everything you do except for you fringy because you haven't been doing much
of anything so hold on i i say this endearingly because i want him to go back to doing things

fringy's coming back there we go right now
oh all right someone please make it any fact jingle bells cover yeah that'd be really helpful
well i'll uh see you guys all right see you around man talk to you soon
toodle pip cheerio bye bye um goodbye my n-word yeah it feels weird happening on a christmasy
episode as in we got the snow falling in the background it's like okay um snow i like how
people are now saying don't let wolf down fringy you made a problem all right so i've got a whole
bunch of extra memes like like 20 that are gonna get transferred and sorted out but i'm not doing
any more memes for this stream we have five hours and 50 minutes remaining i am going to
read super chats and i'm going to open up a notepad and save every single one that's directed at wolf
and i'm going to skip over them uh instead of reading them out because it'll make that's going
to be quite a few it is a lot of them are directed at wolf but that's what i'm trying to say is all
the people who've made videos who are concerned they weren't shown on this stream if they had a
hint of copyright i was basically adamant in not showing them to make sure this stream didn't go
down um i've got someone just said you skipped the scroll of uh there's a meme i went over but
it was really long so i've kept it for a future meme we will read it no worries um future memes
will all be like i said i'm just gonna basically collect everything into that that recording what
once me and rags and wolf can set up a time we'll make an efap mini we will check out memes that
are relevant that he's missed we will look at videos and um i'll read to him all of the super
chats that are directed for him and we will release it uh but until we hit that 12 hour-ish cap
i am now going to start reading super chats uh obviously fringy j shad even rags if any of you
feel that um you may have hit your cap you're welcome to bow out i need to stay for a bit
longer you mentioned that there were questions though yes actually yes i want to address those
um because i like questions and i don't don't want anyone to miss out and anyone else see i've
got to go uh now but i will like i can i might be able to hop back in later today if you guys are
still good it's possible uh i will i will say tootily pep for now tootily pep sir tootily tootles
and fringy anything you want to say or you good
all right okay he's gone off to work on that video he's promised everyone ah yeah he doesn't
want to let him down so i'm looking at my like i post i it's very untidy i post a lot of the
questions i have for people all in the same section i try and begin them with the name
that they're relevant to and i've got one for rags that i hadn't read so oh right you ready for
this uh yes this says rags mayo blast my salami socket it's deli time and the first slice is free
all right so two things one that wasn't a question it was it's more of a comment really
it's more of a how can i have it so that this wasn't read to you how could i how could i possibly
do that he made freaky leave oh no he said salami socket free i'm sorry
i'm so sorry that's the one wooden rags to bail i should have known i should have known
uh that sounds like a great time yeah maybe one of these days don't count it don't don't count
it out um i've got another another three for you uh again not necessarily questions but things i
guess i felt i should read out to you from people so you got rags loving the dog bites vids
oh thanks thanks i've got some um i've got some planned this the last i just always seem to be
busy with this and that and then i get tired and sleep and hopefully soon hopefully soon i got
some planned out and i got new thumbnail stuff made so that'll kind of help as well there you go
this one says rags what is your opinion on breeders of the nephlim nephlim alpha
oh i haven't played it oh well there you go i don't play it but i i'm thinking about because
i've got some um i've got i've got a bunch of reviews i'm uh probably gonna have done fairly
soon for exclusively games i'm thinking about actually making a review of breeders of nephlim
but i'm also thinking about doing a legit raid shadow legend because it has been it has become
kind of like an actual meme around the internet so i would be interested to really play it and
kind of see what's up with it oh hi yeah i'm back sorry my blue my my computer blue screen
i know you're upset when i said salami socket you don't have to hide from me i get it oh sorry i
would have missed that um however like i actually probably there's probably like a good time to hop
off because i need to like make dinner and also if i'm gonna make good on my my you know my christmas
promise then i need to hop off to write what i'm working on catch you around mr i i i think it will
be something that will be very unexpected but i think if it all pans out and i basically like
put my head down for the next 10 days oh my god it'll be something real cool i hope excellent
yeah you're gonna review cats aren't you you're gonna review cats and you're gonna love it and
tell us oh shit yeah cats comes out in like two weeks yeah we can see that so we can that'll be
our palette cleanser after episode nine what really that's how that works oh finally oh episode
nine's done star wars is over we can watch cats oh man i totally forgot about that but i'll have
to put that on the watch list all right uh catch you gentlemen later well yeah see you all right
okay see you later babe see you later okay so next up for rags and i feel like this is redundant
but i'll ask it anyway so rags you managed to get a copy of breeders of nephilim alpha
kitty give us a little review it's on steam you don't need to like you don't need to suck someone
off in a back alley to get a review code for it all right it's on steam and no i if anything i
click that as a meme so i could screenshot it and send to somebody but like wolf got it he made the
tweet that i have not played breeders of nephilim um and the the follow-up was uh where can i find
wolf's books to buy wolf is not currently you're not able to buy any of wolf's books in any way
shape or form uh as of right now um moving on we've got to do where are the shad questions okay
and there's a few let's get going shad why do you sound like grandpa george from c-a-t-c-f
i intentionally do it to my voice so i sound more authoritative oh there you go that's a quick answer
effective you know you've got to cultivate this voice there's a lot of practice gone into it
catapultivate is what we mmm trebuchetivate that's the superior version that's when i
start doing david attenborough's when you know i'm trying to be serious and here we see an australian
the catapult is one of the greatest weapons ever made uh next one hey shad weird spot to put this
but i'd love to see the crouching tiger hidden dragon jiao long versus shulian fight as a potential
autopsy shall in well that would be a long one but gee oh that's a great fight scene absolutely
and a classic you know i think i'd actually i think i do need to put on my list because i kind
of want to hit some of the most iconic fight scenes in cinema and stuff the fight scene autopsy
i was thinking of doing um wesley versus enigo montoya from um princess bride but the thing is
with star wars coming out soon i was like oh i really okay i'm gonna do um luke versus vader
before just because it coincides nicely so i'm trying to do that for this week if i can get
them done hey shad if you're gonna put your money on the choreography being good or bad in episode
nine what would it be it's like i've seen the trailer right and from what we have seen in
the trailer it is garbage like same tier garbage as jennai like the telegraphing and the wide
baseball back swings and it was just like one small shot yeah both ray and um kylo they're just
as horrible as before it's like it hurts my soul oh sorry uh next up shad about the shish kebab
what if the gas tank was on your back and the tube that leads to the torch fitted through your
outfit still a bad weapon um i don't know i see it's simply it's just a flaming sword then the
cable could certainly get in the way especially with the amount of movement that you put into
a certain sword moves and stuff the the cord could get tangled quite considerably um so it's
hard to say it's hard to say i'd want to kind of test it out like i actually do want to do a video
on the protosaber and i have a very upset baby in the background sorry sorry it's a protosaber
nothing just throw a grenade at her oh no that might hurt him
no pieces of shrapnel fly into shad we can't have that oh yeah that's right can you go block it with
his sword true true i like that people sometimes highlight that they're like how stupid star wars
is already look they use swords like why would they use like why are you talking about realism
they use swords it's like um yeah the swords are pretty fucking good when you have a jedi behind it
yeah man clearly that's working pretty well someone with a gun gets the blast deflected into
them they're like on the floor bleeding out going you idiot using the sword he got me but still
stupid uh rags what do i do when we're on questions for shad but he's currently busy
oh i guess i'm still here kind of listening but just trying to cut out some of the
the noise do you want to carry on or we can continue absolutely very well shad thoughts on
memory sorrow and thorn trilogy which which trilogy memory sorrow and thorn
i'm unaware of it i don't think i've heard of it yeah unfortunately i just copy these so i don't
actually know like anything more sorrow trilogy well actually the last part of the sorrow trilogy
is going to release in about a week so we're going to see how the the the sorrow trilogy
yeah it comes together yeah i don't know sorry all right uh shad in for honor the first unlocked
knight class executes enemies by holding the blade and striking with the guard is there any merit for
that oh yeah absolutely that's called the mordhau or murder stroke uh mordhau being german for
murder stroke and yeah absolutely uh it's a move used against armored opponents yeah so if you've
got a long sword and you're fighting someone against who's wearing armor grabbing the sword
by the blade and striking with the cross guard is one of the maneuvers you can use which is more
effective against armor than striking with the blade itself so it kind of turns it into a club
so the answer is yes absolutely uh shad thoughts on anakin's move to cut off duku's arms or hands i
guess yeah it's an interesting one he kind of uh again you just have to put up with the glorious
background track but um that's what happens when you're a father but anyway you guys can still hear
me even yep yeah um it depends it depends because he kind of holds duku's hands off to the side
and he brings his lightsaber down around and then up cutting his his hands off at the wrist
with this upward kind of sweep and duku wasn't really doing much with his lightsaber up to that
point if i think anakin might have been completely open i need to look at it with a closer eye
but i suspect it was a poorly executed a bit of choreography because duku might have just
been out of sweep his lightsaber across anakin and chop him in half and he might have just
been standing there to take it so again i need a seat to double check but that's what i remember
from it uh shad i've not seen a take on the s-talk sword how would you rate it as far as
capability and legilat let legality legality lethality maybe a missileity oh yeah probably
i'll say the s-talk is a very underappreciated and underused weapon and more i'll say that
yeah it's a it's a more specific um specialized weapon and there are some that didn't even have
an like a blade edge on them it's purely for thrusting and you could you could like sometimes
consider it the two-handed two-handed thruster some might call it a two-handed rapier but rapiers
generally have swept hilt more iconic related to them um but the s-stock is a beastly weapon for
what it is meant to do and that's a mistake that a lot of people do they generally try and
like gauge swords on universal application taking them outside of the specific context in which
they were made and meant to be used for and so i mean the s-stock would sucks at cutting
like absolutely but as for its thrusting capacity it's one of the most devastating
thrusting swords ever made so yeah so for what it's meant to do it's a great weapon
and uh i i mean this isn't necessarily connected but a part of this is also opinions on the s2
spring steel as a material i need to look like i i unfortunately i can't remember the qualities
of s2 spring steel because i've looked up several different um qualities of steel for saw blades and
there's a couple of different interesting ones that came up to the top of the list but it's been too
long since i've reviewed my notes on it that i just can't remember the names of each definition
so i wouldn't be able to tell you off the top of my head fair enough um oh this one's interesting
i don't know how this is gonna go over uh so shad should call matt dilla hunty on the atheist
experience i believe this is in reference to whether belief is a choice that right right oh
that was a deep discussion we were having there it was it was great and i would say something
that i've been reflecting on since i haven't really come to any new conclusions or thoughts
but it's certainly you know something got me thinking okay you know what is what is the
nature of belief um but i don't have anything new to really share on the matter
yeah i mean i am i am a simple messenger i am completely innocent if there is nothing anyone
wishes to add i shall i shall move the f on as as a civil person would say unfortunately i don't
know what they're referencing the atheist experience was it he's a call-in show based out of
austin texas i think okay um shad i'm a mormon member of the church of jesus christ or
latter-day saints as well what do you think of the recent changes i think they're actually very
pragmatic and good um they um what changes um what changes for those of us who aren't
on on the inside administrative changes and so uh uh small things um uh there are different
auxiliaries and organizations in the church um and so these auxiliaries are like uh priesthood
and young men so there were there are two different priesthood quorums elders quorum
and high priests and they're being combined into just the the elders quorum and and so the thing
that needs people need in the church that need to understand is that none of this contradicts
doctrine because there's a difference between doctrine and principles and principles are the
practices and even commandments that are instituted to achieve the purposes of the doctrine and many of
the uh the institutes and organizations in the church the uh the practices that are adopted and
these are things that are being updated are all in line with the doctrine they are just changing
different procedures to achieve it more efficiently in the modern day so there we go
i love that like so few people are going to understand any of the context of this but yeah
i'm not going to pretend to be able to ask you follow-ups on that i'll just be like
hopefully hopefully that answers the person's question um shad how do you feel about the soul
reaver sword um spit out a proportion it's the one with the really wavy blade with the skull
above the handle if i remember correctly the skull seemed to be a bit oversized which would throw off
the balance unless it was like hollow and it was just a kind of a an external facing just to get
the look um then it could still be functional but i i can't remember the finer details to really
comment on any more any more specificity than that unfortunately all right um
see some of these i don't even know the context how many eight foot people do you know shad
not many i don't know i feel like the answer is zero how many eight foot people do you actually
do i can't think of one yeah i mean i mean i've completely forgot the context of that one um
oh look at this one hey mauler i have a question for shad will we ever see a return to the rogue
star universe oh i would love to but i don't think um this is coming from a youtube channel
that my brother launched and i was one of their founding members of it uh tabletop time where we
did role playing games and stuff and i was great and i ran a campaign called rogue star which was
very popular and that was very story driven um and uh unfortunately doesn't doesn't look like we'll
ever be returning to tabletop time because my brother's just too busy but i'm setting the
groundwork to launch my own role playing channel uh hopefully it could start next year once i get
my studio built and things um and will die would i do another rogue star campaign maybe maybe not
i don't know i wonder if you do other campaigns and things uh but i do want to kind of frankenstein
certain elements from the rogue star universe into a sci-fi book setting that i might want to write
sometime in the future so there might be vestiges of rogue star still seen uh that also ended with
also high rags hello and uh is this going to be like an online thing you do irl tabletop sort of thing
um sorry what was that was there a question for me is yeah is this going to be like a um an online
rp sort of thing or a tabletop like in physical form in a room in your house that you're doing
or yeah so i find the best kind of gameplay and interaction happens when you have people in the
same room together and so that's what i'm kind of going for and uh and so yeah my studio will give
it like i'm building a studio at the back to give me you know for instance i could do uh chats like
this and there won't be as much background noise and things so just to make working a little more
convenient but also to give me opportunity to launch some additional kind of projects and one
of them being that and so trying to get a good group of guys together to yeah do some do some
up good old RPG i didn't know you're into that that's really good i'm kind of starting to get
into it as well and i and i'm really like it yeah i've been i've been into it ever since i
was 12 years old i'm old schooler yeah i started with first edition dnd went through advanced dnd
third edition fourth edition was an abomination and uh they didn't regain my trust to try out
fifth edition and by then i had made my own rule system with my brother hmm very interesting there
you go um uh someone wanted you to say i love you in a heartwarming voice shad
well go on then as in you oh you want me to say it this super chat once i i i believe it
asked you to say it or me to say it for you to say it i love you was that was that was that
heartfelt did it come that was beautiful i think i could try it i could try more more emotion
i love you there you go there you go oh don't recall that gorgeous uh oh shad i recall you
saying you really enjoyed the game dragon's dogma if i'm correct what was your preferred class
mystic knight is mine i did like it first off dragon's dogma is actually my all-time favorite
game no game has actually topped it i like oh and the fact that they've never made us well
they might still but to this day there's been no sequel is
breaks my heart and no the online version doesn't really count as a sequel um because it was only
released in japan how dare they uh so yeah the mystic knight was actually that's why the game
was so good so many of the classes were fun i made probably over 100 characters and that's
probably about true in jagga's dogma playing through on the hardest mode and all that and
i did all the classes i mean the starter classes are lukewarm like luke you know watered down
versions of their higher classes and i usually did a hybrid one so i could get the right uh
feats and bonuses from all the other classes to get the get the you know the toughest character
that you could and things but of course the mystic knight was awesome but i couldn't stand
that the shield was always on the back of your character whenever you move and you only held the
character in your arm when you didn't attack that bug the heck out of me so if there's any criticism
i'd say it would be that all right actually i think that might actually be all of the ones
meant for you at least not including the ones that may have been sent in this stream not a worry
i've gone um i've got one copy here that says ask rags the use figuratively for literally
question i think we did that we're not shad is gonna agree with me i know it no well i mean it
wasn't even i think i even i said like no we don't destroy words even more let's not like
literally does not mean figuratively so the idea is that a whole bunch of people have used
literally to mean figuratively so much that we should take revenge by using literally to mean
figuratively and i said i hate that idea because we'll just kill the words even more uh yeah i
don't know how that's getting revenge on him it'll ruin everything um yeah the proper definition
of literally literally has a very use or important use in language yes and so i say let's try and
keep it yeah i understand that dictionaries are descriptive not prescriptive and they eventually
words change in their meaning but literal is a very dare i say it literal thing like it is very
useful it has a lot of utility to that being used the way it is especially and i i would
really rather not have words mean their opposite unironically gotta draw the lines we're gonna
draw a line somewhere i know it's just awful this is the kind of shit that keeps us out of living
in caves yeah this is how everything falls apart this is how everyone dies okay so we're beginning
yeah i like because i actually agree with you because yeah language is more fluid but for the
i like the original the proper meaning of literal is so useful i will fight against any cultural
kind of sway to try and push it against it but if it gets to the point where everyone has lost
the meaning i don't know if that whatever happened i hope not i would then just you know have to go
with the flow but at the moment we most people do remember the proper meaning of literal so let's
keep it i agree with this man yeah that's my controversial take i suppose uh let's see what
else i think i might have more for rags and he's like people someone said yeah but people don't
use figuratively that often because like i always think that it's more implied than explicitly
stated when people are talking about things figuratively they don't normally say figurative
you know figuratively a lot of the time you know when they're talking about an analogy
or just using it to refer to something and you could just kind of pick it up without them having
to say it um but all right guys i better go i need to help out my wife with the kids and so
well sure no problemo if there are any more questions i shall save them for you sir
it has been a joy as always it was particular fun to come on in such a heated time and
come through thank you so much for being around what you did that was
i think that was wonderful for so many people including wolf i know he had fun listening to that
it was great so anyway thanks guys i appreciate you inviting me and i'll
i'll see you next time i shall catch you around goodbye sir farewell bye bye that leaves me and
you rags what are we gonna do huh what are we gonna oh i don't know i guess we could
we could do all these super chats we will try um at least we could get started on them i got this
one that i i believe i skipped over for the sake of time before and now i'm looking at it and i'm
like okay so you got knights of ren golden company snoke jaws sequels dark fate pandas s u
i guess steven universe i don't know polio watson vader all my sanity which wins the title of most
redundant so i suppose i suppose i suppose we will choose one each which one do you think is the most
redundant i know that i went with the golden company because of the fact that in season eight
of game of thrones they don't actually need to be there for anything to change they are the
the epitome of the word redundant they don't serve any purpose whatsoever so we got not
or no longer needed or useful knights of ren they're supposed to show up in episode nine
so they might do something they might do something golden company what you said snoke snoke is not
redundant the problem is that he is extremely important he is vital for the story but he's
just basically treated as if he's not we don't know how specifically he's important we know he's
important yeah we don't know exactly how jaws sequels i haven't seen the jaws sequels actually
so uh dark fate you've seen i haven't um i don't know i call that movie redundant
i mean things happen people live and die you know i mean like it's not you know
then we've got pandas uh pandas are good for tourism and they're good for some
you know symbolism and stuff like that like a lot of ambles su
that like i said i don't know if that's steven steven universe or something else i don't know
su is yeah someone we'll go through the list someone tell me what su means i'm assuming
you steven universe i don't know what else it would be maybe jack that can confirm while they
go around uh the horn next we have polio uh polio is just well it's it's definitely not needed or
useful so it's certainly redundant in that sense um and i and we've basically cured it and we've
basically eradicated polio because of vaccines watson as i assume in watson and as opposed to
sherlock homes um depending on how it is he's like a grounding for the character he's uh every man
to be almost like a foil for him his assistant um depending on the iteration of uh homes we're
talking about it might be that he can't function normally without that normal person to you know
kind of keep him on track and all that it depends vader is definitely not redundant i mean he
performed a very important task for the empire the connotation there is that he couldn't even kill
the emperor because he's back so does he become redundant i don't know he killed he still killed
all those jedi definitely did a lot of work or my sanity i don't know about the state of your sanity
so i couldn't uh couldn't couldn't say um we've got soviet union in which case yeah
that's definitely no longer needed steven universe is probably what makes sense um
simply unresistible uh shelby uganda uh stupid uranium
i still think the golden company is the most redundant out of all of them
they serve no purpose they just get shut erased stargate universe i i don't i don't know if it's
i don't know anything about steven universe other than their fans are very understanding and happy
to discuss things with you so
so yeah um so what do you go with
um the most there yeah most redundant probably golden company all right there we go i did it
that's that has been answered rags i have a dumb question what the frick happened to v you mentioned
during a dumb in episode 60 what happened to him did something happen to him i don't know
is that was there a steven universe thing you interrupted a question jay you will wait your
tune all right i'm about to head out so if there's a question that he's answering i can do it now and
if there's not i'll just go how redundant is steven universe what like to the story i don't
not are no longer needed or superfluous um what to the events of the story he's like vital he makes
everything happen i don't know man it just says s u and i assume it maybe means the show yeah how
redundant is the show um i mean how redundant is any piece of art pretty redundant now that the
finale happened um maybe that's what a finale finale made everything kind of like not matter
it made like the events of everything just oh okay so if it was that easy to solve why didn't
you just yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna head to the store now all right thank you jay anytime all
right thank you jay what a piece of shit you completely interrupted your question as to what
happened to v is he is he alive i hope so glad now we can get some work done in here
um the next question is hyrag recently got divinity os2 after watching your vid i am greatly
enjoying it thought the physics magic armor negating cc would bug me but no yeah um and
there's a lot and there are uh mods to change that if you if you change your mind and decide
that you don't like this armor system um then you can easily install one of the many many mods for
the game that instead replaces the armor system with the willpower system instead which is very
interesting i'm going through a playthrough of the game intermittently using a highly modded
version and i'm having a good time there's a lot of different ways to play but i'm glad you're
liking it definitely a fantastic fantastic game um and that is all the questions i have saved for
either you or sad not sad we've got some left for archon sargon and i think we got one for
that star wars girl and i'm just giving her one for gary um one for a collective of three people
i'm not sure when that one will be run out and that's about it and i've moved all of the wolf
ones into a file and i'm now going to start on the super chats i like i said i'm going to skip
over the ones that are questions for wolf and save them all into a big notepad so yeah rags you
ready i am ready here we go first one do you guys like the end of mando episode six where the rebels
show up and decide to destroy the entire station just because the track is there and let mando
escape imagine mando left the tracker at a preschool and then flew away since one of the
rebels murder people just because a prisoner might be there yeah that is definite that is
something that made our job as a good a good little a little finisher for that terrible episode
yeah we already pissed we had the rebellion being murderous psychopaths and before someone says hey
man they were launching an attack vehicle or whatever it's like you have no context as to why
they are launching that like you can't just assume that they're they hostile destroy the entire base
like wow and they destroy it instantly and now what utterly disappointed in the uh the republic
the new republic whatever they fucked up holy shit really disappointing what can you do monstrous
action that they just took um yeah we're only two two episodes remaining before we can do an
efap episode all about mandalorian but as you can probably tell me and rags you know how do you how
do you put this uh not huge fans so far three was pretty meh pretty bad well i i don't it was not
good i'll say that three was not good four five and six were bad they didn't destroy it did they
they you see several shots like that seem to explode large portions of the base
they're just attacking random pieces as well as the the the hangar bay that they shoot seems as
though they they're okay with destroying the entire thing that's the impression i guess
also we got um maula will you post the sargon failed stream so we're rescheduling with sargon
and arch we're gonna try and get a full stream done with them eventually the uh the 20 minute one
that we had um i don't know what's the easiest way to access that if you want i was gonna release
it as a mini i'm not sure about it anymore like it's because it's a weird video if it does get
released as a mini it's kind of just like i don't know i'm not i'm not entirely for or against that
as an idea i'm not sure yet um this one just says ooh ooh what should i do with this ranks
hmm um what do you feel is right kill it no no i i agree with him i i also think
i think i think you should give in to your inner ooh ooh
flamethrower no let the ooh ooh flow through ooh you um hello all let's get started actually got
alerted this time as well let's get started yeah that that was my goodness right that was 13 hours
ago that that was said time has traveled to say the least uh what happened to the sargon stream
so my internet is currently having serious issues um they need to dig up my front lawn and replace
several core wires before everything will be fixed luckily for me the internet is not intermittent
right now uh however my phone line is dead and so everyone has to call through their mobiles which
because we're in the future isn't as much as a problem as it would have been like 10 to 15
years ago but yeah that's probably going to be fixed in january because i seriously doubt they're
going to set up to fix the dig up a front lawn during christmas time seems unlikely luckily for
me that means that my internet still works and that we still can stream uh which will be the
intention with rise of skywalker unfortunately that happened on the night that we had the first
stream with sargon of akad the notorious person who destroys everything am i right conspiracy
theorists there's a lot of ideas that he was actually the reason it got destroyed
i don't know why that would be something that people would think but we nearly had it on friday
unfortunately um sargon was exhausted because he did a really long stream talking about the uh
the brexit well no not brexit it was an election yeah uh yeah he was um he was obviously very
thrilled with the election very very happy so he probably was up late he did a stream while
while yeah you and our efap mini i think and he streamed for a long time he streamed longer than
we did and the following day we were all set to go but he was ruined and so he even said he
didn't want to come on to as a poor performance he wants to uh be sort of active and engaged so
we've still got the video we've still got a good efap planned for that it's just it's probably
gonna be in january now because uh we've got the 21st and then theoretically me and rags could do a
stream on the 20 but we'll have to we're gonna have to talk about what we're planning for christmas
if we're planning anything i don't actually know but uh efaps christmas times more to come i'm sure
of it um pewdiepie is taking a break from youtube is that true i don't know i don't know i don't
know but uh if he feel he needs to take a break then do it take a break take a vacation the incident
can be a nightmare um i'm just looking at his newest uploads i don't see anything about
title saying taking a break but you know maybe um anyway uh tlj and riser skywalker might suck
but at least it brought us all together looking forward to your reviews over the movie itself
unlike rise of skywalker they'll be glorious oh yes we've got there's gonna be hundreds of reviews
to watch who knows we might even find some new content creators it will consume us as rags said
on i think it was world class bullshits high council stream that this will be an opportunity
for new creators to really get their name out there if they make if they make the video with
the take you know yeah because it's not just one this will be one of those things you can have
a hundred people who have a really strong take and they all get to get a boost through this hot
topic um obviously i'll be making a video rags will you make a video on riser skywalker i might
or maybe we'll just do a stream on our channel or i will do uh if we'll do a special efap on it
maybe i don't know maybe uh that'll be a good opportunity to do a stream on my channel i'm not
sure haven't decided yet if we're not we're i know we're gonna do an efap maybe that's all we'll do
but it'll be either way it'll be a hell of an efap mm-hmm give me a long one again i'm not even
sure that we can say it's a long one would long ones actually just be straight up 24 hours that
would be a long one short ones are like eight hours normal ones are 12 i mean it'll be it'll
be an efap in all that you probably consider that um uh love you wolf also high rags and mauler
or it just says dot dot dot mauler i'm not sure what to make of that
i'm gonna say hi hmm hello um if water is wet is fire burnt on your side rags
i don't believe so no fire isn't burning it is the thing that burns it is the
isn't it the result of something burning yeah yeah basically uh
uh who is sex and how did my father offend them
sex you know how this works i read super chat sometimes they just don't make sense okay
i'm opposed to sex yeah that's what it says who is sex and how did my father offend them i don't
know what that means father
i am i am not following what they are yeah i i don't know i'm sorry i don't know the context
of that and i'm sorry your father is offended by sex what can i say just to remind people as well
um i'm skipping over ones that are directly addressing wolf we're gonna do an efap mini and
i'll read them all to him got my got my notepad i already have one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen for him i feel like that's going to
go up to at least fucking 300 before this is over um well i guess i'm clearing my schedule
for the next 12 hours 12 12 uh more like 19 hours am i right or am i right
i believe you're correct father is britain offended by saxons
is more or serious you fools really guys sexual harassment i don't understand how does that work
i don't get it either well what is what serious how did my father get offended by sex
what does that got to do with sexual harassment exactly how does that work sex chat help us out
rest yeah someone's asked did they not get it is like no i didn't get it i have no idea
what that means please let us know why well i'll keep an eye on chat but please let me know what
that means it might be some kind of meme that was in the opening of the first stream maybe but
i have to tell you a lot has happened that's like a week in me time i've also i'm finally sobering
up i had a lot of vodka but that's where we're at uh the first efap i actually get to watch live
from the jump you guys have meant so much to me we'll miss you we'll stay safe wish you the best
someone said reverse someone said reverse the words all right um
um wait which was father my did how and sex is who reverse the reverse the words
sex oh sex offender someone's saying sex offender but how did my father offend sex sex
offend yeah he's a sex my father is a sex offender he offended sex what's not gonna do with
the sexual harassment meme from brown table no it doesn't have anything to do with sexual harassment
is chat trolling us no it's supposed to be like a like it it means sex why is my father
is a sex offender because he offended sex that's the that's the joke oh oh that was yeah okay
um yeah all right there you go yeah we are we are better off as a result of that
someone like there are a lot of people like only one person or two in the in the in the chat was
saying that most a lot of people are still trying to figure it out someone is like maybe
sex is an acronym like we're all trying to figure it out onisian groom's teenage girls chris hansen
i'm about to end this man's whole career oh my yeah pretty much high right i don't really know
the thing going on with onisia uh just seems like chris hansen's looking to discover as much as
possible about the whole situation and do some till i know that onisian was knocked off patreon in
recently ish so getting he is what he was he was removed from the patreons why i don't actually
know the reasoning exactly um i just know that that happened uh let me see um controversial
youtuber banned from patreon after alleged doxxing onisian has come under the tuts tuts
now patreon banned the controversial youtuber onisian after he allegedly doxxed a woman who says
he harassed her and manipulated her into a sexual relationship which is uh not the first time
da serious said you guys are tired as f**k at its shows so we're at 13 hours of streaming i've had
the alcatisms we're doing we're doing the best we can but we got we got we got things to read out
so that's what we're doing we got this uh where's the onisian one uh lots of wolf ones
so tonald is one of the brood now with his stallwars video great hearing him trash tlj
gonna miss you wolf glad to be free of social media tism but yes uh tonald does not like tlj
it was quite a surprise to hear but pretty cool yes he took some shots of the prequels but
ultimately he seems to think that the sequel trilogy or especially tlj is the worst so
i don't know i don't know what else to say other than um welcome to the brood especially after his
his new video we were downright impressed that was that was legit impressive he did a good job
oi mauley why did i see you praising ben kingsley as a toilet terrorist in iron man 3 on twitter
did i mention him on twitter also i thought that he was pretty good in iron man 3 honestly um
i'm actually really disappointed that we didn't get to see him play the role of the mandarin
because man did he seem like he was nailing it um but uh when they made him play trevis
slattery the like fake actor dude i thought he did great as that too ben kingsley's just a really
good actor um just because he's in a terrible movie does not mean he was terrible in terms of
acting that's probably what my take would be i don't remember talking about that on um twitter
but if i did that's probably what i wanted to say but i can't confirm unless i see the tweet
that may be referenced and um also hi rags hello um
hey guys i hope you have a great stream was wondering what you think about that college
teacher that uses tlj to teach his students how not to write a screenplay i say bless that man he
knows what he's doing i'd love to see an actual like uh how how like um you know like like a series
of lessons that are all like focused around maybe scenes portions or acts of the film and just just
how that like how a lesson plan might run out with that sort of thing that could be really cool
like i stand by the whole like it's a challenge for homework like to discover as many problems
with the film as you can and then like mark each other's homework or something yeah
um
oh my so the reason i'm getting slowed on this is i've just like the next six in a row are all
directed at wolf so i'm gonna i got you i got you gives me a little bit of a speed bump but i'm
getting there um
it's a shame we can't get the efap screening of episode nine a weekend at palpatine's
a weekend at palpatine's i mean palpatine's gonna be alive and well so it wouldn't quite be
the same plot as that movie i imagine unless who who would the dead person be in that scenario
probably um just star wars in general that would be the corpse but um you know the stream we're
going to do for it instead we'll just do it'll it'll have to do and i'm sure it will like i said
full roster probably going to be the 12 hours again and all about episode nine your one-stop
shop for such things and um yes the 21st so it gives you guys a little bit of time if you really
want to um sort of see the film that's really up to you i suppose a lot of people feel that
they don't want to give any money towards it but some people do want to feel that they want to um
have context for our coverage but we'll do our best to provide all of that as well
when did the spiders develop wigs they fly now that fucking clip man they fly now they fly now
everybody was really pissed at that definitely didn't make any friends make any friends no like
the thing that it didn't earn them any friends that that that trailer agreed yeah no friends
were made as a result of that no friends made of course you guys start just as work starts
is that good or is that bad i think we could keep you company while you're working yeah
just your friends say hello
okay
okay hello all my e words does that what would the east end for at that point
e words um i don't know e words and i'm entirely sure so not internet words
oh my i haven't you know this this this theoretical mini is going to be very long
um with the with the bonus memes the the the videos we're gonna have to watch out all these
things i'm gonna have to read out but it'll be worth it uh hello me in eight hours i wonder
if that's accurate it might actually be that's probably pretty close actually yeah it's a good
way to remind yourself of things okay uh everybody betray me i'm fed up with this warl
that's a super chat a well worth while one
again i think i'm just going to say this every once in a while i'm going past a lot of ones that
are specifically directed at wolf from saving them all into a big file um make sure he gets
everything was watching southpaw's podcast and got introduced to bigidious pupil just t f i
justify justify uh-huh also watched g force and it was still better than tlj featuring knobs
maybe um maybe g force would be a good e-fat movies because it keeps getting brought up
because of the knobs thing but we have to watch it now just because knobs is starring in it
we have to see how he performs
death star destroyers sounds like baby's first fang chick the fan fiction what the
fuck is wrong with jj i wouldn't even write that when i was 10 well he's got his opinion
you've got yours but how else do you actually like outdo the super duper super duper duper
super star destroyer it's like well have a million little ones that's that's gonna that's
outdoes it right like unironically i would have i think there's probably an idea that
ended up on the cutting room floor if you will that they all joined together into a giant laser
that could like wipe out galaxies but uh you know people people like jj that's going too far and he
was like oh man um efap is a podcast about a movie about space wizards intended for children
intended for hate mongers of the toxic brood i'm not going to disagree with that yeah it seems
reasonable honestly remember that this podcast is for people with a sense of humor
and it's all our opinions so you can't criticize it um but we will also simultaneously talk about
how someone is stupid if they don't agree with the perspective that they hold in the video it'll
make sense um have a great efap everyone that's a nice little opening super chat i'd say
rhapsody in blue goes public domain on january 1st really that's wow that's interesting i didn't
know that that's that's fantastic though that's an excellent piece well i feel like a lot of that
there's gonna be a lot of surprising ones with that as time goes on you know it's gonna be like
oh this is lee you could use this however you want die you're like oh shit
like uh mickey mouse that's in the next few years right
i bet you guys can't wait to put mickey mouse in your fan fictions i think
yeah well if hmm i wonder how mickey mouse would
this is the thing that they've used mickey mouse so little now like i think by design because
they're losing the copyright unless the lawyers can fight to push that as far as possible i don't
really know um maula can't say nagar um there's also ways you can pronounce this nagar that could
be another one this is a word that's allowed in through super chance was clearly referencing
something but um you know i disagree with the super chat i was able to pronounce that
i was i was able to say it 100 clearly with no issue um he is uh
gonna watch riser skywalker on thursday can't wait to hate it wow going in hating it already
see this is what i mean about the toxic brood is disgusting like they don't
watch movies with the intention of just enjoying it they go in hating it it's disgusting yeah i
mean i want it to be hilarious yeah going in like being like oh i hate it already terrible
it's not like you've read the leaks and you know that it's going to be terrible right
that'll be ridiculous um someone said uh do a no do a beetleborgs efap mini oh my god
beetleborgs isn't something that i had i haven't heard of big bad beetleborgs in a long time
what is beetleborgs oh here let me um copy him because i remember some of the cheap
shitty toys um uh here you you recall this big bad beetleborgs no i don't think i ever saw those
or at least i don't remember them at all there were a couple like they were they're almost like
power rangers there were different iterations of them
um i remember some of the toys and stuff when i was really really young
someone made beetleborgs in soul caliber but yeah we need to do uh oh jay leno was in big bad beetle
wow why but there's oh it's sabin uh they made big bad they made beetle and they were also
the power rangers people i think um yeah let's check out uh we need to check out beetleborgs
sometime wow that isn't beetleborgs that's not something i have heard in a long time
curse of the shadow borg
okay um shadow thank you all for the countless hours of fun you guys have brought me i'm a truck
driver and i spend countless hours along the road listening to you guys makes the job much easier
or easier so rags wolf and mauler thank you you bet man yeah absolutely good stuff
maybe you're listening right now on the uh 13th and a half hour of this double stream
um i almost forgot merry christmas wolf you know what i'm gonna take that to be merry christmas
for all of us and it was yeah i'm gonna assume you care about us as well uh a lot of people have
accepted star wars died at round head's hands i mean it's complicated to pinpoint the death but
i think tlj would be the sort of wide shot that you would throw at it you'd be like it's around there
if you're gonna pinpoint it exactly maybe even riser skywalker could be the exact pinpoint i don't
know just a second don't uh pay money for the riser skywalker pay for a different movie ticket
actually good one then sneak into riser skywalker and be prepared to laugh at the comedy film
the lovely folks over at lucas film put together i know that that's what a lot of people are going
to do so that they can stay in the conversation but also uh not give disney any money um
though i think a lot of people are going to go the jack sparrow route as well naturally you'll get
your uh you'll get your porterican style shaky cam coverage i believe i think it was ea who made the
joke in his like tl i couldn't just tlj or something else coverage but he says like uh
there was a part of the film he couldn't quite make out because too many people were laughing
over it or something and he was like directly on purpose referencing the cab copy that everybody
uh who didn't go to see the movie had looked at um
um
um i don't know what to make of this one worth got leaven kill to change my mind
worth leaven leaven
those are clearly people but i don't know
oh
maybe a reference to something that we're not on the up and up of
oh cube uh those are characters from cube however i haven't seen cube so i do not know
that's so have you seen cube i know of cube i saw cube two i didn't see cube one
oh there's a cube two yeah maybe we should see those you two wasn't very good
cube two was i've heard cube one is good or at least much better than first the second one
apparently it's like hypercube or something yeah let's yeah we can uh oh the second one's
called hypercube no it is called cube two but it's it's cube two hypercube well so
for instance right this is something i remember about cube two two people have sex
and then they spin in mid-air and then they age rapidly and die oh my god that's something
that i remember happening um i i can't remember the exact context but i remember even as a young
man watching it and being like what the fuck minus i was like oh my god i'd better never have
sex yes because sex i don't want this to happen to me makes you an old
um
the only people who trust rotten tomatoes are the people whose opinions align with the critic score
yeah this thing i don't know anybody who appeals to rotten tomatoes critic scores
you know people don't typically because those folks little bit crazy when it comes to movie
movie takes um opinion about the ghostbusters afterlife trailer
it was okay it was fine it was nice and kind of subtle and it wasn't very like crazy over the top
it had a nice sense of scale to it and i'm curious to see what they do with it i'm curious to see how
it uh how it turns out i liked the subtlety of it i think that it's tough to think positively
about it because of the fact that uh of everything else is going on in hollywood right now in terms
of just destroying ip's um i think it's got potential and uh maybe we should try and be
a little bit optimistic like this would be the one to be optimistic about i think out of everything
we're dealing with um let's see what happens with trailer two that eventually comes out and
you know hopefully it's okay hopefully it's okay what else can i say yeah i am cautiously optimistic
but i like the trailer enough and holy shit it's a damn sight better than 2016
um the file size for a figure in the advent calendar is 80 to 90 kilobytes except for j
whose file comes at a whopping 313 kilobytes therefore j is a massive what is what's wow
what's up with that did you does he have is he on a rhino or something i don't think so i think
maybe there's just some preference there i don't know cubicans may really like j you know he just
might um this one just says i have a sense of humor i think this is in relation to the
you need to have a sense of humor to watch the video if you remember oh yeah you know it's good
we split those streams up because that one's going to be available for me to repost it like
almost immediately after we're done with this stream so people can see at least the first half
straight away oh yeah that is good that's processing uh rags rapidly reposts retarded
roast rebuttals amen yeah i don't think we can disagree with that nice one uh
uh
ray should have been a conduit that anakin used anakin would lend his natural ability in the
force and his learned skills to nerd to one individual this explains ray's power and allows
anakin to stay important how does that work ray should have been a conduit that anakin used
like as in like used as a force ghost like maybe he could possess her i don't know
i don't know what he means so ray should have been a so maybe if darth vader was coming back
as anakin he would be good he uses
me oh if anakin wanted to remain a part of the trilogy this would give a yeah this is
i guess like an explanation for how um it would be a better explanation for why she's so good
yeah i'm not sure i really like that like that because the idea of him just being able to give
all of his skills and talent to somebody right that sort of opens up some options there too for
other people to be doing that yeah which complicates everything i just i don't know i'm crazy
thought i just want people to stay dead just stay dead anakin had a great series of movies
from one to six just stayed dead even though i'm pretty sure he is definitely staying dead
not coming back in these movies which by the way shocking honestly i still think that i'm
surprised overall that they didn't bring back vader that seems like the thing they would do
vader is yeah the most popular villain of all time in culture so why not just bring him back
bring back palpatine you know these fuckers don't have any shame at all exactly so why not do it
maybe they'll bring him back in episode 10 oh episode 10 jeez when will that happen yeah
maula mechanizes model massives meanwhile menacingly messages ma rei su
why would i message ray massages ray oh my goodness menacingly massages i'm curious
exactly what that entails how would you interpret a menacing massage ranks
a menacing massage oh strangulation oh so we're just like digging into people
would i strangle ray do you think that that's the case no i i wouldn't strangle ray what about me
would i do it well or maybe like a creek no i wouldn't strangle you no no i strangle ray
oh no no no no you wouldn't strangle ray
i mean she kind of ruined everything though she's just i mean yeah i wouldn't don't kill her
not like i don't know all right ray we're gonna spare you you can you know be happy
yay good morning i've always loved listening to your podcast you'll legit my favorite maula
oh very kind uh listening to this while cleaning toilets at work
oh as long as you got some company in your ear that could probably pass the time a little bit
quicker i suppose um i'm glad you respond to this shitty video i watched it and hoped you'll react
to it because there's a lot of bruh moments in there like i said man this one more so than any
other video in the history of efab was sold to me as the video to convince a person that tlj has
quality in it yeah this is really not a not good i was just talking the most we heard most of it
before was expecting more um this one says i mean it says carrot something and then a ugh i wonder
if it's like foreshadowing for the carrot being cooked bad thing i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna
choose to believe that it was foreshadowing this next one says test what do you think that could
possibly mean well maybe they were trying to see if test was a banned word by goog let me give it
time um also all the super chats i sent with the rep rep repetitive letter thing please send the
money to whom i addressed in them so ten dollars for all of you massives absolutely uh the balrog
was a tennis ball on a string during production man lord of the rings was such a silly movie oh
i know right fucking silly ass movies those fantasy films so silly
shouldn't hope to recreate those because they're just this silly
i don't even i can't even tell you what the fuck his point was with that silly
uh
hi massives haven't had time to chat uh to catch up with all the chaos over the year because i
was recently joined uh joined the marines here's a small pledge been efapping since its conception
the genesis if you will uh yeah i mean i'm i'm really glad man oh um what about a sex strangle
chat asks you can force heal her if she cry if she cries oh my god well you bring people
back from the dead oh no please she can though well you know there'll be more questions
questions shall arise um guys thoughts on the harry potter movies
they're fine i guess you're fine uh you need to talk to harry potter fans because i i just i was
never that into them um i but but like i thought the actors did a good job i thought it made sense
for the most part but i'd have to watch them all again and i just don't even really care to because
i just don't care about harry potter that much unfortunately um i remember doing bad plot
summaries with my friends we always started with remember that time when and everyone else had to
guess what it is yeah i think there's a lot of those that are like custom made that you can sort
of try and guess but they're a great way to understand that you can make any movie sound retarded
and i hate the idea that star wars is just so silly look at how silly there's a guy in a robot
suit guy in a dog costume who's not even wearing pants how silly i'm not wearing pants i'm not a
dog costume though advice on starting a movie review youtube channel
what do you got rex oh try to well i said i don't know about specifically movie reviews
but try to do something everybody's doing give people a reason to come to you um people only
have so much time so if they can only watch a certain amount of videos give them a reason to
choose yours over anyone else have something about your personality or the way that you look
at information and assess things and analyze info to make them want to get your take or make it
entertaining if you can yeah and then for me i just be like stick to what you're passionate about
to keep yourself going and do your best to stay as accurate and structured as you can
and i know that a lot of people seem to think that my videos the people who don't like me
like oh so unstructured just funny you can ask metal he's been helping him re-script his uh
john wick video the amount of structuring that goes into script writing and redrafting on my end like
i guess i'll have to review one of my own videos one day to try and point out how much structuring
there is but it's it's good for you and um you eventually kind of have to learn your own video
sometimes if you want to do like a really big important breakdown that's that's that does the
job and you don't have to return to it um you gotta learn it as almost like a fiction you're
like oh i started with this i mentioned this before don't want to repeat this point or move
this point to this section or to make this more poignant i'm gonna talk about it here instead of
there like that sort of thing i feel like uh a lot of the stuff we usually say is just be detailed
accurate passionate lots of the sort of standard pieces of advice but they really are good for
getting you uh on the way um even the quote good artists copy great artist steel quoted by steve
jobs from picasso is stolen from previous people good artists copy great artist steel
yeah i don't know about that yeah you'd have to sort of go really far into what exactly you mean
like again about the whole the line between being influenced and creating something new versus just
outright copying and pasting like this it's complicated jay has really outdone himself
these last dozen efaps a job well done mr manager majority shareholder now kick jay along with wolf
hi wags hello i mean yeah we can kick jay we we did already you must have found that
satisfying he was kicked twice actually so not bad done a good job today i think most would agree
um i think you're good this notepad is getting very very very large oh my god do do
you
started playing as zabrak in star wars dnd doth moles race called mal craxis do you guys have a
favorite race the white um let me see a favorite race in star wars i don't know um
if i was gonna be besides human let's say non-human race um
um uh star wars races
all right uh
star wars alien races i got a list i'll go through some here all right
um i'd want to be a claudite those are changelings oh like uh zam in the second movie
zam's a claudite i would definitely want to be a be one of those um um
um
so far i'm just going down a big list here those are looking like uh they're gonna be the ones
i mean it's a pretty strong choice i wonder what uh
incredible ability and we're all we're assuming humans off the table i guess yeah a non-human
boathans aren't too bad
many boathans died to get that information um
trandoshans can i think they could regrow limbs
they have like really big regenerate they have very super powerful regenerative capabilities
um let's see obviously ewoks uh but
do do do um zabrak is what mall is
yeah probably the claudites i'm willing to agree with that anyone can find something
from literature and mythology from star wars is a documentary called star wars the legacy reveal
that did that yeah he was he was upset that apparently the critics are not talking about
the mythology those pesky bastards um along with terminator resistance keep an ear out for the fan
game tech comm 29 20 29 uh marx reviews has an exclusive playthrough of their unreleased demo
all right hmm uh currently uh banned from discord because i argue that sports are fake and gay
vet your mods mast man also hi doggy uh hello like i said i'm assuming it's probably more than
just saying sports are fake and gay but i mean sports are real and gay i'll have you know yeah
i think that's fair um
uh oi maulie mind playing your tlj critique part two at 1 22 50 for a minute or so it would
definitely seem appropriate for our current time um i guess i'm curious now enough to be like what
is what what is this reference it must be in relation to the video 1 2 2 50
okay instead it was nothing ray's power is her own and we will likely know nothing about
appearance now or how they inform her character which is all we had because of how much of a blank
slate she was the defense for this is that it's subversive content as you are also readily aware
of so let's do this what is the purpose of subversive content exactly oh i don't want to
play this whole section but uh yeah i said i i say it's likely we won't even find out what uh
how exactly her powers came to be now but apparently we will because she's palpatine's
uh granddaughter yeah turns out she's palpatine's granddaughter it makes sense if you think about it
oh yeah i'm curious how much they're gonna bother trying to explain that
they're just gonna be like i don't know she they'll throw a couple flashbacks in or whatever
it's gonna be so crazy walking into the theater being like this is it here we go who knows what
we're about to see really we've read the leaks but honestly you know yeah i'd be curious not
if the leaks are accurate but how much they're accurate really
someone they said it was exclusively and specifically because i said fake and gay
the mods even so well if that's the case then i think they fucked up in their moderation and
i think that they should reverse it um but that's if that's the case if that's the case i think
that's a ridiculous reason to get banned from the server and obviously they should um undo that
and you could clip that shit and send it their way assuming that was why you got banned
yeah like i said i get i'm not a mod um well for one i can't do anything about more decisions on
the disco because it's i just don't uh involve myself enough in the admin decisions to be able
to be like i overrule everything here but i seriously doubt because i do know them pretty
well i've known them for like five years some of them now seriously doubt so they would ban you
just for saying fake and gay it doesn't seem like them but you know if they did yeah maybe that
that sounds fake and gay on its own um uh didn't jj say i'll do what i want in regards to episode
nine yes he said fuck it in like an article so i think that's what we're getting um according
to the terminator fans paramount may have purposefully wanted dark fate to fail so they
can push their version of john connor with chris pratt in the upcoming film the tomorrow war amazing
uh the tomorrow war i don't know um that's one of the new man is drafted to fight no war
where the fate of human ability to confront his past um
let's hope it's good shit
i mean i as far as i can tell didn't the director of dark fate say he doesn't know why it failed
he was like i don't know it seemed like it was pretty good uh wags is co-op by wags also high
wags hello and i'm not co-op i'm amazing i'm inquitable proof that empire would be well received
by fans infinity war the hero's lost in the end yet people regard both films as high quality
entertainment yeah that argument was terrible and it kind of reflects how stupid his argument
was later about the titanic that that shit did the titanic ed with the iceberg hit no
the why would tlj ed like that idiot it hits the brain uh braintism as they say
cz fap during a reaction to tlj apologia this is where the fun begins oh yes
fun is not gonna say it's definitive me you know yeah
uh first super chat uh
gonna miss you all if you and the efap gang made my days a little bit brighter and i'm
thankful for that i'm gonna head out and watch the whole thing later also high wags hello
oh pretty much the answer to all these terrible arguments is if tlj is so great
then why do other films need to be made worse to prove it
also by wolf um yeah there's a common practice for a tlj apologist they will constantly reference
just how bad the ot is the ot is just as terrible guys the ot is uh guilty of doing
the things that you don't like that the sequels do bad bad bad this video changes minds about
tlj before watching it they liked it still now they are one of us uh yeah like i said i'm curious
because like i said a lot of people on twitter and on discord had sent different messages
including that they were convinced by i don't know if they'll feel we were either unfair or that we
offered a different perspective that changed their position on uh the film uh video sorry so
i don't know like i said a lot of people found it convincing i don't know why weird yeah i don't
know why
all right doing a lot of copy and pasting i'm starting to think that maybe maybe i should um
we could do another catch-up stream what i can basically like my what i'm thinking in my head
right now because i can pull up two notepads and basically go through the entire backlog and just
sort into wolf ones and then me and you ones and then do a stream with you and just go straight
through a list of me and you ones hmm because uh there's just a lot of delays right now
where are we at we're at seven and a half hours we've got like i said uh we were intending to
do a stream on tuesday so we could just do a super chat catch-up on tuesday remember that
how much time do we have left oh we got quite a bit it's just okay uh
like i said it's just lots of dead air because i have to sort through super chats
i don't know if that means that we should uh refocus or or whatever
so what do you think like to keep going and go for it well i'm suggesting that uh say for
example if i stop stream right now and then uh sort through this entire selection of super chats
into ones for wolf for when we do the the mini and then ones for us and then come tuesday uh you and
i can do just a super chat catch-up stream and i just go through a notepad filled with all the ones
that directed at us and then we'd be caught up ready for the 21st well it might not be a bad idea
because we've this stream was started like what seven hours ago yeah this stream not including
the last one was about the same so we got like what 13 14 hours of streaming today yeah i will
i will say i am a little bit biased in the department of i i'm feeling slightly hollow in
terms of energy yeah i'm starting to get there too but i don't want to waste people's time in
terms of just like lots of silence until i get the right things out instead of what you can have
instead is a focused selection of hours of me and rags just smashing through all the questions
yeah and plus we'd have a lot more energy such and yeah but none of them will be missed like i said
i have been collecting all of the wolf ones it's huge i'm gonna read all of these out to him he's
got no choice but uh yeah i don't know it just seems more pragmatic right now and um by the time
we even get through a decent chunk of these more will come in so instead i can just sort them all
offline and um yeah it might be the best idea we can tackle the super chats with more you know
energy and umph and all that we have been going for like 14 hours now uh the majority of the day
was spent streaming already yeah and holy shit were they some epic streams yeah these were these
were good we did we did a good pair defaps 64 and five with some good tisms good rat if you will
i'm so glad we've gone through so many memes as well because i can
stop logging so many um and some of some of those memes guys were were really good
oh yeah like some of those are really still fresh in my those those were good stuff
um but yeah not not looking to disappoint uh i will get working on all of this to make sure
i separate it up and we we can nail it like i said on tuesday me and rags will probably do
a stream where we just do what we did last time get a full catch-up done as for when we'll do
the one with wolf uh he's going on i think i believe some kind of trip with his family very
soon and he won't be back until late december so it'll be january that we're probably going
to be able to do what will be the copyrighted meme videos and like i said we could do that
slightly earlier but we're going to want wolf to see him as well so i think most people who've
made those meme videos would be happily happy to wait uh along with extra memes and and all the
super chats that are meant for for wolf though i would say that like past this stream if you could
not send any more super chats for wolf because holy fuck it's going to be really difficult for
me to read all of these to him in one sort of go um i've only i've only gotten like i've got a shit
ton and that's what like 10 so i'm gonna get them all sorted um but yeah i think i think we're gonna
wrap up there um because otherwise we will accidentally do a 24-hour stream which is the
the concern we will always have i'm sure we'll never actually get there
and then once we get to episode 100 i'll have to do a 50-hour stream or something but um it's been
kind of crazy we did tonal's good video tonal doing guitar a tlj video that went through almost
like a cavalcade of all the arguments we've tackled over the two years all in one video
it's been wonderful in its own way then uh all those meme videos loads of throwbacks
um and all the meme meme images loads of art all the very generous donations a bunch of cameos from
efap alumni as well as lots of interactions with wolf and and a debate between remarkable
republican and shadow visti who could have seen that coming wow a blessing truly a blessing it's
a it's a christmas miracle and yeah there you go we had zero christmas efap streams and now we got
two i will yay so as soon as we go offline i'm gonna start posting all the memes we covered into
the into the discord and i'll uh get the moolah version of the first half of the stream done as
soon as i can um thank you all for hanging out with us like i said we'll come back on tuesday
to do a super chat catch-up and then um yeah it'll be is it saturday is the plan for
yeah next saturday efap 66 where we will be talking about riser skywalker because that's
where we're at execute we fap 66 we've come full circle guys yes um anything else you want to say
before we sign off it's just hard to believe that tlj is what brought us together and it's
finally time for the next star wars movie to be out because solo doesn't fucking count
do people still remember that movie happened i don't remember that there was a han solo movie
it was really good um it was great but yeah thank you for everything folks and uh we will
see you tuesday mm-hmm have a good one goodbye
