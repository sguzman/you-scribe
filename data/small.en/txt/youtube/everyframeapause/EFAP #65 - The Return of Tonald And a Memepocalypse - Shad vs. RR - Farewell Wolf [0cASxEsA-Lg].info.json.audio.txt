It's telling me whether or not the broadcast is working, uh, during people in chat saying things.
It's like, I'm gonna assume it's working at that point. Maybe I'm wrong. Who knows?
Who knows what shenanigans YouTube will play? Exactly.
All right, now I've just gotta find the relevant video and then snatch a chat link from it because
it doesn't provide me them anymore. What? Yep. Like, I gotta go to the individual video and get
chat from there instead of having it beforehand. Not annoying at all. Nope. People are saying late
man bad. I did what I could. You know, 30 minutes isn't a lot to do all of the tisms. You can do
some tisms, I agree. But what if it was? Uh, that's a will I don't want to be a part of. I'm sorry.
I don't know how I feel about that. Well, how do you feel about a will that doesn't have feelings?
I'm sorry, what? I don't know how much I can feel about a world that doesn't have feelings.
Well, or it doesn't have rules. What if you're talking about how you feel about this will before
entering it so you would still have the feelings? I had a feeling once. How'd it go?
Oh, that's kind of shit. That's why I swore off feelings. And then I took a vow that nobody else
could feel things or have opinions. It went well. All right, everything should be fine.
I'm getting faster at correcting all YouTube's speed bumps.
That's the previous ones unlisted. This one's the only one that's around.
And we're live. Thumbnail's correct. Chat is working. Everything, literally every last thing
is perfect. We did it. Excellent. All right. So if you're all still in the watch together,
we were we were about to carry on with watching a bit of Tonal Bloke.
He has graced us with a return. He disappeared for a bit, had himself a break. And that's fine.
We all have breaks, you know, but ultimately, Tonal can't leave the internet forever. He is
the inspiration for hundreds, if not thousands, if not millions, millions, billions. We're going
all the way back to the reason EFAP was created. Exactly. TLJ and Tonal. Those are the two things
that made in heaven. So yeah, you guys ready to watch some Tonal? I'm very ready. I was born ready.
Exciting stuff. Here we go. And naked. Oh my.
After EA's less than stellar treatment of the Star Wars franchise lately, I had more or less
expected Fallen Order to land somewhere in the ballpark of painfully average to a bucket of
deep fried crap. For me, Star Wars has actually been going downhill for years. Jar Jar Binks,
the laughably fake CGI, midichlorians, hem, and culminating with the unholy apocalypse that is
the last Jedi. Man's got some opinions. Man's got some opinions. TLJ's the unholy apocalypse,
fellas. Well, yeah, if we'll have Tonal understood themes and characters, then...
I can't believe that Tonal actually has the cognitive functionality to be able to say that
TLJ is bad, but the last guy that we just watched can't come to that same conclusion.
Oh, it's Tonal's fault. How much? How smart do you have to be? I severely underestimated how
intelligent Tonal actually is. You gotta remember, the guy in the other video said you gotta be smart
to be able to have seen this stuff, right? Tonal is smart. So I'm not like he bases his
smartness as a quality. He is what it is to be smart. He is. Yeah, he's smartness.
You gotta be smart to understand TLJ is what the guy's point was, right? You gotta,
he said something like you gotta pay attention and you gotta like all these different things. So,
you know, Tonal is just like us. He just, you cognitively failed TLJ to come to this conclusion,
but that's fine with me. Oh my. We're in this group. We'll stick together with Tonal leading
us through the darkness. Good Star Wars and bad. And on the gaming side, EA has more or less
condemned Star Wars as well to a life of mediocrity with the failed MMO, the mass market
cash cow battlefronts, and the kitty games on mobile. Next on the chopping block is Fallen
Order. And to my surprise, and thankfully EA finally did what any sane publisher would do with
the competent. He's like the way he speaks to my surprise. And thankfully the prize and thankfully
EA finally did what any sane publisher would do with a competent developer partner. Stay out of
their way. Fallen Order is the first piece of Star Wars media I've consumed in 10 years that
I've been fully satisfied with, with the exception of Rogue One on film. In a year, at least mildly
replete with good games, it stands atop most of them actually with fantastic art design, a well
paced and fun story. What does replete mean? I don't know. I'm about to take a little look-see.
Tonal's using words, or well supplied with something. So, mildly supplied with good games.
All right, Tonal. You guys, you know, you meme about how, oh, it doesn't make sense, some words
he uses. Well, sometimes he teaches us shit, okay? I was just being certain. I didn't know if
replete meant like it had to be like full. So it was like a way of saying half full.
Someone in the chat asked what MMO he was referencing. I think he was talking about
The Old Republic. Although that wasn't an EA game. He might have fucked up and said it was,
but it still did fail as far as I'm aware. You failed. To them actually with fantastic
art design, a well paced and fun story, and solid game mechanics. If you want to be a nitpicky,
you can definitely find some flaws. The game's cosmetic system. 21 different ponchos. I mean,
come on. Some issues with the camera and hitboxes. Not enough bosses. Nor complex boss mechanics.
A few bugs and glitches. And of course, the game's... I wouldn't say the bosses, just the bosses
fucking suck. And a full on game review here. This is weird because the video is called Woke
Star Wars. I'm not 100% clear on what he's referencing yet, but I'm excited. I guess we'll
find out. Lead up to the finale. However, they nailed the rest of it. Fallen Order is an extremely
fun action adventure game that you can pick up and beat in 15 hours without the need to repeat it as
an all inclusive package. Under the heavy hand of modern corporate and game design, that might
not be a worthy proposition for a gamer who wants an all-you-can-eat buffet in every single game he
or she owns. However, for those who like our game experiences concise and punchy, Fallen Order fits
the bill nicely. In replace of arbitrary bitch work, grinding, checklists, or fluff, you instead
have a linear set path with one quest to complete to arrive at the end of the game. Cal's Adventure
is the classic race. Can you pause it? We're almost two minutes into this video and I'm like
not able to pick it apart. Yeah, he's so far pretty sound. It's like actually kind of solid.
Makes sense so far. I disagree with a couple of his takes, but not like huge disagreements.
Yeah. Wow. This is bizarre. He's coming a long way. He did it.
The sacred item against an evil bad dude, or chick in this case, that wants to kill you and rule the
galaxy. At no point in the journey does the game ever move backwards or sideways and the conflict
always jumps forward from point A to point B in a very timely manner. Character threads are mostly
fleshed out, Cal's character arc feels natural, and the motives make sense. This is a game that
plays like a video game but acts like a movie. Introduction and setup, sudden conflict, rising
action, defeatism, struggle, and defeatism. I don't even know if you could refer to it that way.
Could that... Well, defeatism. Let's have a look.
Apparently it exists. The acceptance of defeat without struggle.
I don't know if that's applicable because I haven't played the campaign yet.
I don't think it's quite applicable. I'd say defeat is, but I think he's just trying to make
it sound a little better, but it's not tonal. Rising action, defeatism, struggle, and resolution.
All in 15 hours of straight to the point, no BS gameplay. Gotta admit, this is a pretty goddamn
nice breath fresh air, and to be assumed mostly independence of EA's influence. Pretty nice breath
fresh air. Did he don't even skip the all? This is a pretty goddamn nice breath fresh air, and to be
assumed mostly independence... Rewind that and slow hold it. Okay. I don't have to gedelb that shit too.
Gedelb. Gedurlb. Gedurb. Yes, gameplay. Gotta admit, this is a pretty goddamn nice breath
fresh air, and to be assumed mostly independence of EA's influence as a publisher.
Influence. Somebody else said this, didn't they? I could have sworn.
Influence. Influence.
Influence. It's influence. Accenting the wrong syllable. Pretty nice breath fresh air.
It's a level.
Traditionally, they've toyed with developers like puppets, prodding them with a barbed whip
at every corner, condemning them to create games in a vacuum of what's best for the bottom line.
Here, free from subjugation, Respawn was able to make the game they wanted to make without
all the BS that comes with the madness of modern gaming propaganda. Holy shit.
That's a classic toy. Can we just rewind that again?
Without all the BS that comes with the madness of modern gaming propaganda,
holy shit. A game developer sets out, makes a game they want to, and it's good. Shocking.
Overall, the game is small in scale, but it packs a punch. Trilla as the villain
is completely badass, not to mention hot ass.
That just makes it sound like he's saying his literal
name. She's pissed, and her hateful presence enfoils the tale nicely in a sense of urgency,
which makes Cal's mission feel pressing, which led me to want to keep playing and see where it was
going. Boss battles could have done with a little bit more mechanical depth though.
Not only is there not enough fights in my opinion, but the showdowns here
feel slightly run in the mill. Run in the mill. I actually agree with the sentiment though,
I haven't really disagreed with too much of this video. Lies, obviously lies.
If you've played a Souls game, get ready to feel right at home. Roll out of the way of the overhead
attack, block the three hit swiping combo, dodge the unlockable, dodge the three hit swiping combo
I think. Yeah, you made sense. Souls game, get ready to feel right at home. Roll out of the way
of the overhead attack, block the three hit swiping combo, dodge the unlockable, punish.
If not for the awesome spectacle of fighting in a rainstorm or atop a thousand foot tree in the
movie of Avatar, the bosses would otherwise have been just go. Yeah, I guess he's saying it looks
kind of like Pandora, I guess. I will say it looks more like Pandora than it looks like Kashyyyk.
It's like a really fucking overly generic forest level. Doesn't really scream Star Wars at all,
which is weird because you'd think Kashyyyk would be really easy to make look like Kashyyyk is
supposed to look, I guess. Just looks like a really boring forest for the most part.
It's okay. Still fun though. That's because combat is fun in fallen order across. It's still fun though,
and that's because all those combat is fun. Who could argue with that? Cow's lightsaber feels
weighty yet fluid, which sinks up nicely. I said weighty yet fluid, I think.
It was numerous options for character movement and environmental manipulation, dodge, roll,
parry, force powers, and healing. Unlike the obvious influence of Dark Souls, the need to
constantly roll around like a damn chimpanzee is not necessary. Cow can pull enemies to him,
push him away, slow down time. You know, the only issue I'm having here is
all understand the title. Yeah, I don't understand the title, but this is unironically one of the
best videos we've covered on efap. Yeah, it's so weird. Like remember when he was showing those
clips from like movies and shit? They actually like made sense in the context with what he was
saying, whereas usually that doesn't happen. Man, what can we say? Yeah. Did he actually make a good
video? Dodge, parry, whatever he wants, as previously mentioned, as a result, combat has this
warm flowy feel to it. That ends up being one of the games warm flowy. I didn't get that warm creamy
feel. I didn't. I don't really like the combat in the game. I mean, he's clearly in love. I don't
really mind the combat. I have issues with the enemy design and the enemy placement.
And I cannot get over the fact that the scout troopers are the melee ones. It doesn't make
sense. That is a little odd. One wouldn't expect that. That's for sure. Strongest areas. The other
area that was really well done was the level design and platforming. Taking some influence
from uncharted and Tomb Raider, Fallen Order is filled to the brim with simple platforming
challenges and puzzles that connect map routes together. These platforming elements come in a
form of sliding, jumping, roping, wall running, and climbing. Certain elements require special
items, which limit Cal's exploration capabilities initially, yet he can come back to them later
once acquiring the tools. It's a recipe that calls for a heavy dash of dark souls.
A glug of Prince of Persia. What does that mean? It's a glug. It's more than a sip.
Okay, I understand him perfectly. It was a dish of a Sunday brunch should be the humble fruit salad.
Normally, we don't get many hodgepodge titles because it's difficult to find the right symmetry
among different game ideas. For the amateur developer achieving equally, I was enjoying so
much, but if you wish, Librium is a disaster waiting to happen. For Fallen Order, there are
so many avenues for potential peppery that it boggles the mind. What was that? I guess we had
a slow note. Potential fuckery was it? Okay, back to slow note. Giving equilibrium is a disaster
waiting to happen. For Fallen Order, there are so many avenues for potential peppery that it boggles
potential peppery. That's what it sounds like. Poppery? I'm pretty sure he meant to say fuckery
and he's blocked it out. It just sounds like fucking poppery. I don't know. The news for potential
peppery that it boggles the mind in this regard. Too much combat, too many climbing sections,
fiddly controls, annoying levels that wrap around way too much, yada yada yada, I can go on for days.
Simply throwing everything into a witch's cauldron and praying it turns out. What a strange
reference, but alright. As opposed to another cauldron, but alright. You can get wizard cauldrons,
they're very different operating on this. You like to have the cauldron of a wizard?
On way too much. Yada yada yada, I can go on for days. Simply throwing everything into a witch's
cauldron and praying it turns out greats is not going to get the job done in most cases, let alone
make a fantastic game. It takes a deft hand to create balance and tie those elements together,
and they achieve that with Fallen Order. If they want to build upon this game and make another,
surely giving the player control of the starship would be the first order of business.
Fallen Order provides no space exploration or combat, no stealth, no player choice in the story,
and no role-playing elements outside the skill tree, which is limiting in itself. Perhaps these
are the things that they could consider for their next iteration, although I'd be perfectly fine if
they didn't. That's because this game is good on its own and you can't find many games like Fallen
Order. It's both a high quality linear action game and an amalgamation of not just some of the best
industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing and mixed in the proper proportions.
It was really bad about it in the past where it would just be him cycling through a menu and then
randomly cut to him walking down a hall. He is improved. Like, I don't know what else to say,
like this is, you know, we're near the end. Wow. It's like he watched us and actually took
the criticism to heart. Yeah. Tonal, this is unironically a pretty good video. I don't agree
with everything he said, but this is genuinely good. This is up there, man. Not bad. And an
amalgamation of not just some of the best industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing and mixed
in the proper proportions. You see that sentence? It's very confusing. Properly. Yeah. It's an
excellent game with mixed, you know, it's an odd with mixed in proper proportion of the game and
an amalgamation of not just some of the best industry game ideas, but with excellent pacing
and mixed in the proper proportions. A feat surely much harder than it sounds.
Fallen Order is not original. It's not innovative. It's a consolidation of industry standard game
design with the amazing visual world of Star Wars and Respawn's well-known wall running mechanic.
Nothing more and nothing less. Sounds about right. Okay. Yeah, that's pretty much 100% accurate.
If you've ever tried to whip up a fancy recipe for dinner, the easiest part is to go to the
store and buy the ingredients. The hard part is bringing them together correctly so that the dish
is harmonious in the end. Fallen Order takes components and creates symmetry. It's not a
perfect game, but it's as good as any game I've played this year. And it doesn't try to be
anything it isn't while doing it. It's not ashamed of what it is or where those ideas came from.
It is a game that woke Star Wars from the brink of death on the gaming front and
oh, this. Oh, oh, he used Woken. Correct. Woken Woken. Yeah.
Oh, that's definitely not what I. Yeah, I wouldn't title the star video that way.
Not when the connotation with Woken Star Wars is pretty obvious.
I mean, the title doesn't make any sense. And I understand what he was going for,
but it really shouldn't. He shouldn't have titled it that way. But otherwise,
this is pretty strong video. Yeah, the amount of time he spends. I'm blown away.
The developers at Respawn should be extremely proud of the game they created.
It proves that whoever is funding the creation of anything Star Wars really needs to separate
themselves from the actual creation. This will probably reduce the chance that games or movies
get made with a hard on for the bottom line and nothing else. The highest quality products are
produced when a hands-off policy is promoted between teams, which gave me more power to.
No, I agree. He didn't use the fart sound. No, he didn't use the he said
or something like that. Like he cut himself out almost.
Like five minutes. Why didn't he just do that? I missed the phone.
I need the phone to know that this is this is this is an adult.
How am I supposed to know that it's a potty word? Mm hmm.
No, a thing or two about making a good game or movie to make something people actually want.
Maybe we can take this lesson learned and carry it through to build a brighter future of Star Wars
media. Oh my God. Oh, what can we say? If that began to shit on tonal a year later,
he's actually put out a good video. Oh, my God. What the fuck?
Well, our child, I'm so proud of you. Our boys grown up. Mm hmm.
He's become like genuine man. Make more of this. I would actually subscribe to you unironically.
Oh, my God. He's become everything and more. You think it's like loads of time.
Well, do you think that he's just really passionate about this game and so
thus passionate about the video? Maybe maybe that might be the case.
Someone in the chat said that maybe tonal is so apolitical.
He doesn't actually know what wokeness is. Oh, God, you might be correct.
Look at those claps in chat. Look at that. Very good tonal.
Congratulations. We're proud of you.
Everyone go give this video a like and like say we want more of this.
Yeah, it's a pretty good review. That was that was good. Take it home, buddy.
Tonal, you just offered us the best video we've ever watched in the history of eFap.
That might actually be true. It might actually. I'd have to look.
This is the day the Lord has made. Oh, wow.
That brings us into the nicely into video memes, ones that are free from copyright.
And here we used to think that tonals would be like a video meme, but it wasn't.
It was. It was insane.
It was a real. He's redeemed himself.
Yeah, so there's there's a lot of video memes that are copyright minefields,
and I have kept them all into this big folder. We are going to record something offline,
looking at them, and then I will re-upload that as a eFap mini,
just like, you know, meme mini or whatever, after I fiddle with it in Vegas to get it
copyright friendly. Give me a lot of things I'll just do to it. So if your preferred video
doesn't show up, don't panic. It's just because it's probably copyrightisms.
Even everyone's clapping and someone sent in a super chat saying that he didn't even ask for
the claps. That's how you know he's done something right. He didn't he didn't pull a jab on us.
So, wow.
So many to choose.
Guess we could start with back on the meme stream, we covered a guy called
Capital Opinions. Do you remember that man? He he made the NPC review.
Uh, yeah.
So he's got a video called film criticism when everything is subjective.
But we've checked this out. Yeah, let's take a look.
Hello, friend. Hello. What did you think of the new Joker film? I really liked it.
What did you think of it? I really disliked it.
I respect your opinion. I respect your opinion.
That's pretty funny.
I love the pause. Yeah, like they don't know what happens next.
So we watched NPC reviews one. He has NPC reviews number two.
Oh, my goodness. This is called that film you like is actually dangerous. And here's why.
Oh, my goodness. So quick disclaimer. Remember, this is just my opinion and you're not allowed
to criticize me. Okay.
I didn't want to have to make this video, but someone has to put everyone in their place.
And I guess it's gonna have to be me.
You know the one. I'm not going to mention it by name because I don't want to give such a dangerous
film free publicity, but this movie might just be the most socially irresponsible piece of media
to be released for this year. And this current social and political climate with far right
extremism on the rise with a literal white supremacist in the White House with incels
and gamers going around shooting people and saying things I disagree with on the internet.
The fact that they made a movie that humanizes a white male protagonist is absolutely appalling.
Not only that, the movie actually tries to get audiences to sympathize with an incel
loner who commits acts of far right terrorism. Now, I haven't actually seen the movie because I don't
want to subject. But nonetheless, I think it's important to talk about. Now, some idiots have
actually fallen for the idea put forth by the main character himself that this movie and this
main character aren't political. Yeah, right, as if it's even possible to be apolitical. You see,
this movie is just one of many movies released in recent years that tries to trick audiences by
claiming to be apolitical. But in reality, it just supports the status quo. Like Paddington 2.
The colonial experience. This movie even has the audacity to have the veneer of leftist class
politics over it to make you think the movie has something meaningful and deep to say. Spoiler alert,
it doesn't. Speaking of the supposedly apolitical nature of the movie, the director of this film
has been going around saying this movie is a response to the woke crowd and the mythical
cancel culture we're allegedly living in. Which should tell you everything you need to know,
really. Well, no one thinks my offensive jokes are funny. Well, if you can't think of jokes that don't
cause literal pain and violence towards marginalized people, then maybe you should study
quantum mechanics, build a time machine, and go back to Nazi Germany where you belong. Anyway,
all the great lengths this film goes through to portray the cisgendered straight white male
protagonist as a victim. The real victims of this movie are the actresses of color that the film
uses like props. Side note, if I were to suggest a rewrite to help fix this movie, I would make
Sassy Beats the main character instead of Joaquin Phoenix. And instead of being a single mom, she'd
be a badass crime fighter. And instead of it being anything like it currently is, it'd make it
completely different. It's a small change, but it would make it all different. It's a small change.
Ah, but alas, that's not the movie we got. What we did get is a movie that clearly hates women.
And what's most frightening is all the ignorant and easily manipulatable audience members who
won't see the racist and misogynistic themes of this movie and will internalize the ideology
without any critical thought. Thankfully, I'm here to save you all for yourselves and help you save
the correct thoughts and see the world properly. You're welcome. And as if all that wasn't bad
enough, the film is just a blatant derivative ripoff of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver,
which is a much better film. Wait a minute. If the movie is problematic and it's a ripoff,
maybe it's because Taxi Driver has deep themes and this movie is shallow and thinks it's smarter
than it is. Yeah, yeah, that's it. This movie isn't nearly as smart as it thinks it is. And
it has absolutely nothing deep to say about anything. All in all, this movie is just bad.
It's dangerous and irresponsible to make a movie like this on current year. And I think there's
still a very high likelihood that this movie will be directly responsible for violence.
In fact, I'm really hoping it will be because I would really validate my worldview. Anyway,
that's all I have for you today. Thanks for watching. If you like this video, don't forget
to like, subscribe, ring the bell and give me all your money. If you take anything away from this
video, let it be this. The next time you think about going to see a film directed by, written by,
or starring a white guy, just go support the films of marginalized filmmakers instead.
Anyway, thanks for watching everyone. And always remember,
everything is objectively subjective so you're not allowed to criticize me.
Pretty great content, huh? That's good. I like that.
Capital Opinions. Yeah, I was gonna say. I like it.
We'll post his channel in the chat in a moment. But yes, Capital Opinions, you can find him.
He's made two of those now. We covered him last time on the meme stream that we did.
Hopefully, this one doesn't go down with copyright at some point. So that it will be
delayed as hell before we actually get to promote him again. But buddy stuff. I have a feeling that
he's aware of the podcast. We like your videos. They amuse us. They are very good. I think they
are fantastic. You did a good job. So many great quotes. Most of them are real. So it just makes
it that much better. I like how blood the video is. If everything is subjective,
this is how a movie conversation goes. Yep, pretty much.
All right, so I've set this one. I'm not 100% sure of what I'm dealing with.
Oh, boy. Neither do we. So don't worry. A mod of some kind.
That's the big, true, true.
Fuck you, Derek.
That's it? Like, I don't have any more for that.
Can you replay that? Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Is that a pizza wall?
Oh, fuck you, Derek.
Got to be a woman.
Yeah, I know. That's it. I don't know.
Who's Derek? What's the what's the context behind that?
Right. Who's Derek?
Oh, I forget. Oh, my goodness.
I forget about all all that such vitriol.
I know. I must have really hated. He must have really been a piece of shit.
In fairness, he's Derek. Yeah.
Typical. This is typical. Fucking Derek.
All right. Ready for the next one?
I'm very ready for the next one.
I love this one. Fads of Baguettias.
The Freudian and pupil Baguettias are the first in history to engage in debate on the trap questions.
Dearest pupil, I beseech thee to abandon these explorations unto massively.
The gods erected boykind to please girlkind, not thine tireless phallus.
Considered this honored mentor.
If it were a lad of most effete beauty and the room were dark,
would it truly be queenly to mount him in ignorance?
Imagine, if you will, the shadow of a youth cast on a wall in silhouette.
They're growing as yet obscure.
As stimulating as I find such theoretical, the ancient wisdom remains unchanged.
If the balls do not come in contact, as a man partaken in the big gay.
But my master, are you not in an effable champion of the subjective naturity of existence?
If all about us is but a mirage of our senses, then surely the big gay too is up to interpretation.
A world of our senses is surely subjective. Never doubt that, fair Baguettias.
But within the framework of what our eyes and pains do tell us,
your summertime fling had a manhood beneath her stola.
You ought to confess to your wife, O Pupil.
Leave big titties out of this.
It's actually too wonderfully written.
That was great.
Yeah, there's two big videos of that exchange.
We'll have to.
Oh my goodness.
Yeah, that was a good one.
That was great.
Whoever wrote that.
Hard to keep the names together.
But that was that was one I'll remember.
That was quite a quick, funny one.
There was a good comment in the chat.
Brooks isn't a debater.
And that's what I've always said.
I've never said I was a debater.
I don't do debates.
I don't even do very many live streams on my channel.
I just do this for fun.
And yeah, if I'm a bad debater, so be it.
I don't give a shit.
Debates are gay.
Debates are gay.
I love the visual representation of debates
and him breaking his own neck.
Yeah, mauler debates are gay.
Debates are gay, yo.
All right.
Such a sweet, such a sweet lad.
This one's pretty legendary.
How many medias are there now?
Too many?
Yes.
One is too many.
That turned out pretty well.
But it's also less than a month.
Should we do a Medea movie for our little side project?
Yeah, boy.
Oh, yeah, we could do it.
Marvel is released.
Medea gets an abortion.
It doesn't seem like great schedule.
It could be.
I don't fucking know.
I've never watched one of those.
You have to ask, which is that?
Well, well, that's a thing is like...
Medea goes to Wakanda.
That wouldn't be a far-fetched conclusion.
Medea joins the KKK.
Medea joins Thanos.
Medea.
Medea invades Iraq.
Oh, it's the passion of the Medea.
Safe private Medea.

I still can't get over these Medea names.
Medea battle angel.
Black Medea down.
Clockwork Medea.
Medea's Bizarre Adventure.
Guardians of the Medea.
3 tend of Medea.
The Dark Medea Rises.
Medea Skull Island.
Grand Theft of Medea.
Medea.

Surprisingly.
Promedea Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
Medea.
That's so much better.
It's picturing like the dude's body with like her head,
but like still muscular blue.
But she's like, you know how Han Solo says that Indiana Jones
is like a well of content.
There's so much you can do with the character.
There is nothing that compares to Medea.
You can put Medea in anything.
And it will be just as terrible as the last one.
Yeah, they put a lot of effort to make it.
It's like going to visualize the Medea films is important.
I love that Billy the fridge was just sitting there silently.
You don't get it.
You don't get it.
I don't know.
Sexual arrest.
Okay.
Sexual arrestemento.
This is good.
In Maller's video, Captain Marvel and Unburdled Man at Timecode 2014.
We see a clip of Jeff Bush.
Now I know what you're thinking.
What did you bring me?
But wait, came out on April 18th, 2019.
And the f-app stream that manufactured the Jeb Bush meme was on November 3rd, 2019.
That's exactly 200 days apart.
Why is this?
Is Mahler a plant from the Illuminati and or the Bush family to help set up the new world order?
I love that frigging what's in that trailer.
Can he really move sugar with his mind?
Who can we ask that would know?
The pig from the Walmart commercial.
That thing's thick.
Hey, he's just dropping his money everywhere.
No, big idiot.
Well, that's all the time I have for this video.
High raggers and long man mother.
Hello.
Hey.
Good, uh, good conspiracy theory.
Not gonna confirm or deny.
So, um, this, uh, I'm not even gonna tell you why this was created specifically.
I hope you'll just know.
Oh, is it another one?
It's a short way.
No.
Jay, what do you want?
I'll get, give me some.
Oh, that's horrible.
It's the droid to kill movie ball.
It's horrifying why though.
Oh my God, you can make memes.
That doesn't mean you should.
Oh, what a terrifying creature.
I thought that was like a chicken or turkey, like rolling down the hall and then it unfolds.
It was terrifying.
I agree.
That really is terrifying.
Oh my goodness.
Gotta love that we did the force sprint thing to the force super speed.
And we were talking about that earlier.
It all comes.
Oh my God.
Remember that tune ranks.
Oh my goodness.
What was the context of that?
That is a bat woman episode.
That woman.
They're all terrible.
So it's kind of hard to be like, oh, it's a bad one.
But yeah, this is the bad bat woman episode.
Not the good one.
This is the bad one.
Oh my God, I can't say I have no, I don't know with me.
What does it mean?
That's true.
A big.
Oh, it's Twitter.
Yeah, Alex.
No research.
What?
That's JW.
It was trying to warn us.
Who do you think it was?
Like I was Twitter deleted.
I didn't know J had the kind of power.
Isn't it?
I hope it was funny.
I mean, I think I think there's some validity there.
I don't know.
I can't disprove it.
So it must be true.
The fucking tooth.
I was expecting it was going to be like, see, they have like
similar facial structure.
And that's like no teeth.
They do, though.
Clearly they do.
Jeb is a mess.
The big Jablowski.
Jiberis.
Jeb off.
Jettler.
Jeb wick.
The lie of the witch and the jeb.
Oh, my God.
I can't imagine like being a human and having this much hatred.
That's amazing.
That's a good meme.
I'm good right there.
All right.
More good rat on the way, you know.
That was some good.
Genuinely unironically hope that Jar Jar is in it.
People say it's like a bad thing.
I would love Jar Jar to turn up.
It would make me so happy.
It would genuinely make me happy.
By the way, we are 14 seconds away from finishing this video.
And they cannot mistreat Jar Jar either.
If someone kills Jar Jar, I will be mad.
Yeah, if they created Jar Jar defenders.
If they brought Jar Jar into the narrative and had him die,
I would be upset unironically.
You just brought him here to kill him.
Jar Jar deserves.
He was just sitting somewhere.
I can imagine the scenario where they get ready to kill Jar Jar.
This is what the fans want, right?
An old Jar Jar living off his pension from the Senate.
Just relaxing in retirement.
And then, you know, episode 9 knocks on his door and just fucking cuts it down.
He wants to shake me back out of it.
I look violently at him as the representative of the move.
We're like, fucking sequel films.
He just did better.
That was really funny.
Sad reality.
Oh, that's fun.
It's the second time we've seen a meme that covers something we talked about in the last stream.
Yeah.
Oh, this one I meant to play at a different point, I guess,
because it's like it's not a meme video.
It's a video that's kind of like that NPC review thing.
But it's also a good rant.
Jumping.
This is called Every Game Analysis Video Essay.
That's what this is called.
All right, enjoy.
Jumping is a core part of video games from Super Mario to Super Mario 3.
It allows the player to move upwards, forwards, upwards and forwards.
But what makes a jump feel good in new and exciting ways?
I'm Tom O'Regan.
This is Game Player's University.
And let's jump into it.
Oh, my God.
It's perfect.
That sounds all right.
It's got all the amount of pretension that one of these videos could have.
It's a Bob Brown video.
Like through and through, it's perfect.
What was that?
It was 1988's Super Mario Bros. 2, directed by Kintsuki Tanabe.
Otherwise, it's easy to think of the Italian plumber as the grandfather of jumping.
The grandfather of jumping.
A little more complicated.
You see, while released in the US and Europe as Super Mario 2,
the game is actually just a reskin of the Japanese title, Mega Man X.
And so it's actually the blue bomber we have to thank for the gift of ascension.
But how does this jumping work?
And what new opportunities did it allow for?
Let's jump into it.
Goes to black again.
The mechanic works like this.
The player that's you would press the B button to gain altitude or pair that with the left
or right buttons on the D-pad or directional pad to perform a lateral movement.
In retrospect, this might seem shockingly simple.
But back in 1786, the game was like, I've never seen anything like it.
So how did this simple yet revolutionary new idea
change the gaming landscape as we know it?
Well, let's...
Shit that has nothing to do with anything.
Keep singing, let's jump into it.
Third fade.
Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung was a stronger influence psychologically
on their environment and especially on their children
than the unlived life of the parent.
Now you might be wondering what this has to do with jumping in a video game.
With jumping, developers all over the world are putting their own unique spin on this
brave new mechanic.
Now you can jump off walls, jump on your half,
sometimes even jump, and then jump again.
What exciting new territory do you want to go in some color?
Aim for the bushes.
Hey, thanks for watching.

I like to think he may have seen Goodell, no idea, but that was wonderful.
That was perfect.
I loved it.
That is from Tom O'Regan.
I will push him into the old stream chat in a moment, but I just love it.
I love these things because it's just like stripping away.
All of the pretentious garbage that you get from those videos.
Because they just see through it, people.
It's so crap.
They're just like, let's jump.
Like, I learned so much about jumping from that video.
I didn't know it was jumping.
I feel like a jumping expert.
More parody.
Shit, it's fun.
Oh, video essayists.
What won't they do?
They make good content.
All right, this is called do plant sneeze.
Do plant sneeze?
You don't know.
Copyright claims.
Do.
Do.
Do.
O.
O.
like we just says bullet glad you're back wolf played up the last time I'll
ever be on YouTube well at least you saw it yeah oh this one
I'm a man use well for extra game of Thrones oh my god and the fucking shitty
thing is the last two episodes were really good me and mala were so happy
we were like fuck it's good again it's really fucking good again and then this
happened and we were so happy for most of the episode and then the end happened
it's like what the fuck did you do that for it to top it all off ice dragon with
the blue fire so it breathes the blue fire on the wall and blows the fucking
thing up but then when John needs to hide behind a little fucking scene it's
very good we wouldn't get hit with copyright for that song right because
that's all over the games is that how that works like let's please be hit with
copyright right they might be I don't know that's the thing I don't games are
really weird mm-hmm and asking for consistency with a copyright is I don't
know the fucking point where all I wanted was to see John fucking complete
his goddamn I don't know if I can risk it unfortunately it's gonna be covered
because like but wait maybe it stops at some that episode it's pretty good risk
to Duke's such a great soundtrack you know yeah do you want to save that for
the yeah actually that makes a lot of sense we will save it mm-hmm okay you
man gameplay said that Mcgordon doesn't copyright his tracks he's used them a
bunch of times apparently we're safe oh all right all right apparently
three because the whole point of the white walkers was to show that the game
of thrones is petty and useless and that they should stop bickering over retarded
shit like that and fucking come together to fight a threat bigger than them well
now the threat that's bigger than them is fucking done
well if you're just mad George RR Martin is better than Tolkien Tolkien
would rape him
blame wolf if this could if this gets taken down motherfucker I'm going off
this is your fault wolf you'll follow no there's more than one of these talking
about pants oh god I remember this
games are so much it wasn't in her hand is that gonna go wait what the Oh the
syringe oh much the syringe yeah the syringe that she pulled out and stabbed
the character like an American thing isn't it syringe Sid I've never heard it
pronounced syringe it's syringe syringe well I don't like when you were saying
it's a scissors and everyone was like what are you talking look that's not
incorrect well yeah well it's not correct they need to get with the old
times that's me OG rags how do you pronounce scissors yeah yeah well he
said he said a scissors okay listen we can have this discussion again I don't
fucking take my pants and I cut them down the middle I don't have do I have a
pant and then another pant and I put together and they become pants or do I
have no pants you have to have to have a pair of pants to have so you have a
pant if it's like a pair of pants the pant is the leg but they're connected at
the top isn't pants like short for like so now if you have tears of pants I have
a pair of a pair of pants so if you have two matching pants you can't say a pair
of pants because that's just one you say you have two pairs of pants but you
could all but what if they match and you want it in you want to signify that they
match I have a pair of a pair of pants yes two matching pairs of pants well
that's kind of redundant to say a matching pair well you just said you
wanted to let people know that they're matching oh yeah so you say a pair no
you have two pairs of pairs of pants no you say two matching pants two matching
pairs take scissors and you break them apart you have a scissor and another
sister no you have a scissor you have two pairs of scissor blades you don't say a
scissors no one says a scissors it's a pair of because I learned it from a
Charlie Brown comic Charlie Brown like Charlie Brown tries his best I say pass
the scissors not pass the pair of scissors however I understand that's
probably going to be incorrect no no pass the scissors is still grammatically
correct but a scissors is the thing that rags said it that's no one says I
probably say that too casually yeah I'd still be I'd happily consider it'd be
wrong I wouldn't care it's more like a slang thing so yeah sure it doesn't
matter if you say it's just it's wrong so um he gets so much like a video no
tone load is not being given these are really needs okay okay this punch up
punch something right on the nest punch out because you can have one fist and
another fist and that makes you can't have a fists apparently answer implied
even though fists are connected no they're not yes they are
yes are connected every part of your body's connected wolf okay my two thumbs
are not attached to each other just like my to get everything from the
boxing of every single whim is technically still attached to your nose
a pole my toes themselves
if there isn't another one I think there was three oh yeah there is so this
was the other version of the big hideous thing like super in individuals oh yeah
chats asking us to tell Aiden about if she knows about Freudian oh yeah so you
know the when someone says a Freudian slip they're referring to the the guy
Freudian right not not Freud because I would be a mistake his name is Freudian
not oh of course we may or may not have had we may or may not have had a guest
who was convinced it was Freudian and we let them run with it for a few seconds
Freudian and big idiots they are too very galaxy-brained individuals Freudian
and pupil big idiots are the first in history to engage in debate on the trap
question wanna should we read this out I'll do I'll do the are you gonna be
Freudian and I'll be okay I'll be nearest pupil I beseech thee to abandon
these explorations unto massively the gods erected boy kind to please girl
kind not thine tireless phallus considered this honored mentor if it
were a lad of most effete beauty and the room were dark would it truly be Queen
Lee to Mount Timonic imagine if you will the shadow of a youth cast on a
wall in silhouette the groin has yet obscured as stimulating as I find such
theoretical the ancient wisdom remains unchanged if the balls do not come in
contact as a man are taken in the big gay but my master are you not in an
effable champion of the subjective naturity of existence if all about us is
but a mirage of our senses then surely the big gay tune is up to
interpretation a world of our senses is surely subjective never doubt that fair
beginnings but within the framework of what our eyes and peems do tell us for
summertime fling had a manhood beneath the stola you ought to confess your wife
Oh people leave big titties and then we go from that to this meme which is just
a wonder yeah it's a slick editing I like it in the style this channel is
Kaiser Mongol I shall now put this one in the chat as well or at least links
the video I got more there is another one it is a tad too long for our purposes
here too long but we're probably gonna check it out on the the offline one what
is too long for our purposes I think it's like a 24-minute meme oh wow yeah
that's that's a bit long yeah that's pretty long that is a long meme and as
you know we're not a fan of the long here that's uh we know hate the long
can't stand it it should be short and sweet and concise it should be 65
minutes or less should be like a mouse this is some old good rap you guys
yes
I don't even remember that I don't remember what the context of that
Oh my goodness
Goddamn it Kyle Ben
Okay
Sexual harassment
Woooooo
Like when I was like
When I was like I
He seems like the kind of person that you're just
You do want to hurt him by talking to him?
Michael Cera is the red Prius of actors
My name is not Rad
I'm going to be fucked up before my name
You see this pile of papers?
It's a sword-like weapon
And a grape is like a weird olive
Some of these highlights are really good
It's really crazy to have it all lined up
All of the classic memes, like their origins
Oh man
Some history right there
So this is next up in the Efap animated series from Plagued
Plagued Inc?
Plagued Incorporated I think
Ooh boy
Get ready
Good stuff
I love how we've hijacked the Avengers theme
Yes we have
Oh let's pause alright so
YouTube is in chaos
Copyright strikes have spread far and wide
Engulfing the galaxy in what some call the Big Gay
Plagued Creations, that's the name
An ally of Efap has animated this tangent
Making this title crawl an obvious pause spot for meme hunters
Can you spot the four other Efap guests?
Amidst the YouTube chaos, Maul and his team of Efap agents
Have infiltrated the celestial epic battle station
The Death Star
And have made an unexpected discovery
Also high rags
Hello
You know the guy that you see press the lever on the Death Star?
He was a bad character
I mean what do we know about his life?
Does he have any hobbies?
Does he play tennis?
We're going to have another good dog situation here
Generate this whole thing for this guy
You know he was just having a good day at work
He called his daughter
He's like yeah I'll be home late
You know I'm late at work
But you know
Go to bed early
Tell your mom I love her
You know
I love that kid
He's blissfully unaware of what the station even does
He's just like
I just work for the Empire
You know try to put food on the table
They tell me to push a button
And pull a lever
And it makes a very huge sound
My ass
What am I doing?
You know my wife got injured on the job
You know Darth Vader comes by
He's like good work
Good job
You're doing a good job
You know keep an eye
He's like
Hey honey
Darth Vader
Honey make a cake for Vader
Vader's coming over for dinner
Can you imagine
Oh god oh god oh god
And he's like
Oh hmm that was very good
I'll pass my compliments on to the Emperor for you
I'm moving up honey
You know I might be working with the Emperor
I just gotta go to work tomorrow
And you know
All I gotta do is flick a lever
It's gonna be great
I'll see you tomorrow
Then he blows up
And it's just like
His wife
And when you walk to Darth
Those upper positions are always
You know becoming available
So you're always moving up
There's a lot of room for growth
A lot of potential for moving up
You have the celebration
The medal scene in The New Hope
It all works out
And then there's this epilogue scene
Where these series of stormtroopers arrive in a car
And they come out with this whole thing
This little house
There's the wife in it
A folded empire flag
Yeah
She's like
I've just got the spaghetti bolognese is ready
What a naughty bloody ship
It's hot!
Oh my god
God imagine how many people
They'd have to visit for that
They'd have to go out
And they'd have a million houses
He wasn't a good character too
So fuck him
Ten Grineet
Negative 50 BBY to zero
Or Tilda rather
Yeah he had a
There was that Stallsgill cameo
Right at the beginning ish
Then there was the
Watching
Or
We were in the background
Debating water
You've got the fably picture back there as well
That was very good
There's a little
Like a five year old version
Of the person in the empire uniform
Yeah the whole fably address the same way
But that's plague creations
I shall also post him in the chat
Oh my
We love his animations
More the merrier
They're very good
Those are always a delight
Yeah
To watch
It cannot be understated how much work goes into him
It's wonderful
I feel like when we were
Coming up with that
I remember feeling like
Oh this could be animated easily
With how much like
Fucking lols they're coming up with
It's good shit
But yes
Ten Grineet didn't make it
But Lee
There's a bunch of F's in the chat now
Effort
Efforten
Efforten
Alright and this is the last one for the videos today
Oh my
I just
I picture right
Then the extra credits man comes into this kids room
And he's like
Do you know who you're playing as?
And he goes
This needs to stop
The entire problem is solved by a single conversation
Let everyone clap
Everyone clap
They're awesome
You know
Someday someone's going to make like an absurdly detailed
Like 60 FPS animation
And it's going to scare the hell out
I'm starting to wonder when people are going to start like
Looking back and finding all the choice quotes they can actually use
Oh man this is a long one
Yeah
What a feeling
Do do do
Feel the feeling
Come on dude
You do that kind of shit to me all the time
Pip pip doodly do

Tone old as he defeats a dark evil
interesting Jared this meme selection. Oh
Yeah, the tone old is defeating Jared. Is that bats are they bats there? I?
Don't know if that's a part of the original drawing or not next to Jared's head. There's bats
It's just a better to stay with you guys at this point. Yeah, you know, look if women just I got a question for you
This would be an issue
Oh
I'm in the Hot Wheels thing on the wall. Yeah. Oh my god
You know, I this meme selection has been like a throwback to all the really old memes. It's great
It's a great way to really good
There's so many of them you could revisit the old ones. It's like they're new all over again
If she had been the don't know no no no shoes have to be done away around time to warm up the ovens
Your next instance
Back when we called him since
I
Think did it go out of its way to tell you that the person you're playing was pressed into service under threat of their life
No
That's why it's so tragic because in the force awakens the tragedy is that Kylo will destroy her pussy
Just so much about it that's like her titty meat jiggles a little bit like
Boy slice and dice. Yeah. Yeah, this is this is what Hitler wanted. Oh boy. Yeah boy
This is bad on so many levels. We can stop helping to normalize Nazis
Why is my brain failing me what what a what noise is that from okay?
I know I was thinking that's the zombies from Call of Duty black ops
Oh Jesus Christ
I've never seen a more terrifying rendition of me
Goliath
E-fat blood for the E-fat gods
Mark dose
I'm not gonna call it pot dose
Orange juice is the best of all that juice
Really music tism cured critically music is copyright freedom or annoying to pause lights creative commons free download

Yeah
Is that total
That's the you
Is that uh see Jane there maybe
Use a great little droids though
Oh
The cosmic chicken
I
Don't know if we're expected to read all of that
What happened to Rags
I
Got the one
Sleeping on a cloud that is yeah, she got the martini
People call me yes, yay
I
Got a smile for me, huh
Bunch of rhino milks in the chat. I only read manga dude
I prefer it. Oh god, that was from the that's from the game stream
Yes
That was oh my god, that was really great that was wonderful I almost shed a little manly doggo tear there
That was very sweet
I really like that so it was really amazing original artwork a lovely little lovely little song to go along with it
That was lovely. Mm-hmm. I second all of those comments. I
Loved it. It was great such incredible talent. I
There's the video posting in chat flick away folks, it's incredible
I
Like I said, there's a whole bunch more memes is more than double the ones we went through
But they're all copyright related ones. So we are gonna tackle those in a recording at a later date
For now though, it's over to picture memes picture me of which oh my
Boilermash him stick him in a stew. There's a couple picture pie
We got and they're from all over the place. I did my best to order them in some way shape or form
It didn't work out very well
We're just gonna check out some picture memes. Is that all right, everybody? Yeah, absolutely. Let's do it. Thank goodness
All right. So this is the first one got some of these may be in the position have been shown before I do not know
100%
It's for China
We defeated flute musician more than once
He came on a my stream he did I defeated like hardcore in the stream
We had rags did with the super chat readings. I fucking killed him straight away. I was proud of myself
This is a rendition of movie Bob of some kind
It's very flattering on
That is very flattering. He'd need like a mouse in his hand in order to sort of most human. Yeah
Not far off good stuff. Yeah
Just control see this shit make it easier
Got conflucious and big idiots, I think they conflicted at certain points, but
May the rat be good. It is possible. The rat is only understand by society of clowns
these are pieces of information to really think about over the course of
many thinking hours
Um
After the comment about wearing a dress
I'm Tran's dad
Where's the connects me that just today? Yeah, that's a nice fresh one. Oh, we got a whole combo of old and new memes here
All the new sounds good
I
More Jeb memes the merrier at this point. You just be like, let's hope we could make this a reality one day, you know
Jeb needs that gold. Let your memes be dreams
We don't always reference Hitler whenever yeah
Though
That actually reminds me after we've got the picture memes done. We've got that that reminds me Hitler
Actually, yes, we've got that a that thing where we have to decide on whether a quote is from movie Bob or Hitler
That's actually something we can do today as well. I
Figured wolf would find that pretty fun
We still have to play the game
What game you know, is this movie Bob is this a movie Bob quote or a Hitler?
Yes, we've that game is ready to be done
Also again, just to remind people the remaining efap videos that you'd want to be seen
Wolf's gonna check those out as well in like an efap mini. They will be
Covered by him as well as us. It's just to be safe on not making sure make sure this stream doesn't go down
You got is this as an example of good art should be good rat, but you know, yeah, we know what makes it good
Yep, so therefore we can assess what differentiates good and bad not the way for everyone to analyze
Be honest objective analysis makes sense to me. This is objectivity not stop denying my opinion you bigot. Oh
But you have to remember that
You know by saying something is good or bad objectively you have essentially ended the conversation and you are a bad person
There's no more discussion that can take place afterwards. We certainly don't have discussions here and we don't talk about things
Good
Hey, Wolf you were there for that stream the Nando guy who suggested the alternative Joker film and changed everything. Oh, yeah
You're covering Nando he's a good
Oh, would you remember it was uh
It was what's it called collider the guy said go suck on a toad fart. We're all just like toad
I think this is the second meme and it's the same guy who depicts critical drinker as a bottle of alcohol
I'm not against that. I like it
So just strange like specific thing to go to
Yeah, it that is an odd one
So you got the guy who makes like a false
Movie synopsis so Jeb Zilla versus King Diabeto after the dastardly Diabeto's defeat at the hands of professor exercise
He is burning with
Rivian's
When the ominous uchi provides
Diabeto with a serum of geode milk the serum transforms Diabeto into the ultimate form King Diabeto
Jeb knows the only way to stop King Diabeto is to become a monster Jeb Zilla
So, um, I think that film's coming in 2020. Look out for it. We certainly will be review pending
Angry Jew that was funny
I guess this is an example of how we tangent but you got George Lucas sells Disney to Star Wars eventually
We got on to Jeb Bush acts of the deal
Perfect sense to me. Oh god, I don't know. There's lots of implications with this image
Don't hurt me Jenny it all I need to do is turn up in a car and I'll be safe, right? Yeah
It's like you're a band of hooligans
Will save you
Massive
Got one of them movie titles classics
If I have three of the story of the search for total. Oh, look at that. That's a pretty nifty little logo there
I will say that obviously if I fall came out where we found tonal but um
Well, maybe that was the finale of this film. I don't know but either way he came back
He came back with his best review ever. Ironically, that's probably the best video he's ever made
Yeah, I I was finding myself agreeing with uh, what I what agreeing more than disagreeing certainly
Yeah, because you guys don't have the greatest things to say about that game
And he had quite a lot of great things to say and he and he's tonaled and he still managed to make a video
That wasn't that bad
How did he do it?
We'll never know
I mean the fact that
We're ending off with tonal actually
Being good is
quite heartwarming
saving majorly
Majorly of the 1.2 billionth arby has been separated from his squad of fellow pape arby
While his squad debates whether to leave him behind or not majorly must survive on the isle of man dodging three-legged rolling monsters
And a beast legend known as the long man
Thank god
Why is it why are you always depicted with fucking tentacles coming out of your face? I like it
Oh, I I don't dislike it. I'm just like I wonder
Lore behind that or something
No, slender man. I said splendor
I was thinking about sugar. Oh my god. I thought it was like splenda like the sugar substitute
And I got those mixed
Oh
There uh, there are questions to be asked I suppose
Bletch
Bletch
What is with ray's face on this as well, is that the normal one? Oh my god, it's her lip
She looks like she's constipated. It looks like parfait cheek looks wrong. Or am I just crazy? Oh, no, it does
It's probably part of the original. Okay. Well, I'm not gonna judge we'll get in trouble. Remember you can't do that
I don't even
Understand this might be a part of like a series of images that I may have lost. I'm not even sure but patrick williams is entering a plot hole and it's for him
Plot holes are specifically for him
You may enjoy the movies more

I guess we got um
Toxic brood atlantis the lost empire treasure planet disney star wars fans frozen 2 star wars
So we are pointing at star wars star wars fans are crying and then disney with frozen 2 treasure planet and the last of the awesome empire
Okay
I'm a little confused treasure planet and alantis haven't become horrible remakes yet, right?
Oh, yeah
Oh no
Oh man
Yeah, sorry about that everyone but
inevitable
I heard they were making a they were yeah, we learned they were making that live action. Um
robin hood
Mm-hmm. Oh god. Yeah. Yeah. No
I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh my god. That's horrifying. They're all horrifying. They just don't stop

I'm legless. I got the long blonde hair
I
Also has long blonde hair. Well, that's who er is
No, I see what you're doing. You are is legless. No
Yeah, yeah, no legless has a bow
And er has a bow. No, he's got some weird. He's holding. He's got it. Looks like a spear
He's holding it in front of him. You could see the see it's sticking up like that. I'm legless because I have the long blonde hair
And I have long hair in real life. So it just makes sense
Just one color change and i'm basically orlando bloom from 20 years ago
Uh-huh, i'm gonna drown in that mad elf pussy you saying you disagree with them all
You're gonna present a counter you're gonna have to take the l on this my logic is solid
Okay
Yeah, I thought you'd fight for for the position, but I guess you're conceding rags was right
He is indeed legolas
Yeah, cool stuff
Yeah, I thought it was something else because I was wrong
this is um
Oh man
I cannot wait. I want to okay
So the bottle in the movie is not that bottle
This means that this is a production image that was taken for him practicing milking this thing. Oh my god. Yeah
Enjoy that he had to do multiple takes as well as practicing milking this piece of shit
I'm, so sorry mark
So sorry, look at what you've become
You've become the very thing you swore to destroy
Oh for fuck's sake
What now
Oh nothing to do with this stream
Sorry bad video essay
Is this because I am I am ill educated is this metal gear solid
I know that would be my guess. It's one of the metal gears, right? Isn't that like a psycho menace or something?
I've never played a single kojima game ever. So wow. What's with the asian hate? What's that about?
Ah, you know it was just not I knew it
Ephaps angels
Major lee has course rexes in the fur. Yeah boy major lee has developed a terrifying weapon for disney something that will turn
Something that will turn give everyone eric butts mind
Absolute control major lee must be stopped from activating the weapon by any means even if it means he will get to look at woman
That's that I may have had a lot of vodka by now, but that is actually how it's written, okay
That is the synopsis. How dare you?
When someone asks theater roberto why he likes themed isms, I am a critic themes are part of my religion
So undeniably true, uh, this is how girls argue how boys argue
Should the government fund elon musk's cat kills recently
The answer is yes, yes, absolutely for the good of us all
Well, you know, that's just like my opinion, man
You've got all over the background as well
Yeah, it is harlow in the back. Mm-hmm
I don't know if toenold would team up team up with I hit everything but amidst the bowling bowls
We've got another rendition of an efap lord of the rings
This time rags is legolas. Nice. I'm always legolas
I don't see it
Yeah, who's popped up for me? Who's uh, oh shit. I posted the bowling one twice. I am so sorry
There you go. You reach hard mauler. I don't know what that's not
Oh my god, erics
The chat is sam always ever faithful sam
I've been cursed by the mauler plague. Eventually full of mauler fans the next 11 hours. Oh my dude
He's gonna make a video response to your tweet. It's gonna be six hours long. This is so good. Jesus
Undialated yeah, this is what this is what is a standard for um, anti-mauler slash efap jokes
They go he's gonna make a 10 hour response to your tweet
That's uh, that's what I don't know amounts to
I think our memes are better
That's my opinion, right? It's my subjective opinion. We have some pretty amazing memes and we have a whole fleet of amazing meme makers
Oh my god
Ooh boy
I guess this was rags doing a little doing a little tool shop. I suppose
Popping in a little modeling work, you know gotta look good for the hammers
This was when uh, no bullshit described jay as a vulture
On no bullshit's content and then I was like jay you get that means that he considers himself dead
Like i'm sure vultures kill live things but typically they're associated with
Picking at dead flesh right or at least dead things
Most people say about vultures same for hyenas. They have the same reputation. How how sad yeah hyenas are all they're capable hunters
They just like get a bat
This is I think the sims rags is a rendition of rags in the sims
Oh, it says a male though
I'm, so sorry
We've got what are those wait, what are those glasses though, let me zoom in it's kind of like a sticker
Rate ism round head kind of
That's really cool though. Mm-hmm
and i'm rags
Rate ism
Is this like a mod you could make because it has a file size attached to it
I think so. I'm not 100 sure. I've got a couple of links to that one. Um, huh?
This is a movie. I mean to watch with both of you. Have you either seen either of you seen seven psychopaths yet?
Uh
No, I have not seen seven. It is the movie maker who made in bruge, which I adore he made this movie
Actually, I typically argue it's better than in bruge. It's funny as fuck
Um, well, I definitely want to watch it because when you showed me in bruge, I loved that movie
Maybe we should watch it sometime. We should do that
The dawn has been murdered and there are only seven main suspects
All of them have a motive but mauler can't figure out who could pull it off with detective ham hock now on the case
The mystery deepens and turns deadly as mauler is found dead
Detective ham hock will have need his smarts and wits to crack these seven masses before it's too late
Who do you think would commit the murder? I'm immediately going with captain marvel
Captain marvel absolutely would commit murder. She basically has legal eagle would defend it. I don't think he'd commit the murder, you know, yeah
Colin farrell he wants you to think
Well, he's a good cover I suppose
Um
The soldier carried his service dog down a mountain because it was 117 degrees and the rocks were burning his paws
Could you just give him little doggy booties
We don't have a funding for that oh
See this is why you need to elect a president who can afford doggy booties. That's the main that's such
Such a nice thing that you're doing for me carrying me across that desert
On the way to on the on the search for memes
Um
Springy shad is the most likely to kill someone. He has the most weapons rags. Are you challenging me?
I do I do have a scary amount of yeah terrifying if you will fucking love that you shag
Me
Hot man pot scooter all bob
Robo
Robot no, it's it's robob bob robo
If it repeats robob bob
People actually started to notice rags that uh when we begin some videos instead of immediately saying it's terrible
You describe it as strange until you've seen enough
Yeah, it's it's very strange
What does that caption say the number of ways you could rephrase that
Oh
My god, I think I must have heard you say that both of those things a thousand times
Oh, it's perfect
Oh my goodness this one this one's again with the algorithms it's uh
A lot here. So
During a given six hour stream at least two hours worth of superchas will be sent by ravenous disgusting members of the toxic brood debasing himself

Oh, if if if we drop him off in modern times and he'd be like, yeah about what I thought
I mean he's what I would call prophetic
Well, we got we got we got a knobs here
Oh boy
Because here's the thing. Everything is sjw. Everything is anti-white. Everything is part of the zionist conspiracy and you have to point it all
Oh my goodness
Don't know why you know knobs you're crazy

Kind of yeah
The clown is feeling pain I am happy and think it is very interesting conflucious
Oh
The conflucious one where did that come from i've completely forgotten because i'm retarded I don't remember um
Man, I don't think I remember
Someone in the chat will oh my god
Do we need to watch has been hotel there's so many references to it. We have no idea
Me and fringy watched it like within minutes of it coming out. Oh, is it good?
Yeah, good me. I see it. It's just yeah, it's uh, it's just the pilot of the show, but
Um, they got the funding now to actually start making more episodes. So i'm pretty eager to see
Where they go with it not really much happens. It's uh
You know just like a proof of concept more than anything, but it's a fun proof of concept. All right. Yeah, let's do it
Is it better than mandalorian?
Well, I haven't seen the mandalorian. Oh, I've seen the mandalorian. Are the fucking is it better than mandalorian?
Yeah, you could see why haven't you seen the mandalorian yet because I don't want to that's not a reason to not do something
What what
Do you mean it's not a reason not to do something?
Where would you be if you just didn't do all the things you didn't want to do
Well, that's can you imagine a world like that I where people just didn't do the things they didn't want to do
I guess
Well
Then my point should be proof just from that just from
You're imagining you should so well you concede then that you must watch mandalorian even though you don't want to
correct, no, oh
So the argument goes it's something for us to talk about I don't want to watch it
Do we well, do you not want to talk about it with?
I don't want to watch it to talk about it. Ask that don't you know how good it is?
Is
You guys have told me that it looks really bad after episodes, I know you'll love it and we could talk about it
We can talk about if it gets bad after episode two then why would I look about it me rags
And I have said nothing but good things about mandalorian. I love mandalorian beginning bits
I I enjoy mandalorian episode one
See you start off high you like being high right wolf
Yeah, you're one of those you're a blazer
You're a you're a you like this the cosmic trail as the kids say
You like to poof the poof if you know what i'm talking about you like to light up and smoke the devil's lettuce
You like to uh partake of the lotus
If you catch the mandalorian's lettuce if you will. Yeah, if you're buying what i'm
telling
You like to uh, you like to inhale the narcotic fumes
What the fuck are we doing here?
I hope that my um
Euphemisms for drug use of sunken the new episode has bill bear
Don't you want to watch it? Yeah, the new episode is bill burr is a character. He's funnyman
You like bill burr. Why is bill burr? And then you know, that's a good question considering his character
Isn't funny or likable in any way. I don't know if I like him
I like to well, I guess I guess he was fine
But like you would think that if you hired a famous talented comedian like bill burr
You'd be like hey, maybe he'll make us laugh once or twice because he's a comedian and he makes jokes
You would be mistaken
I mean this is disney starward. Yeah, but he's like he's not even a half bad actor in general. He just comes across as like real
That's what I mean. You have to promise you look at him. He has to be funny
You don't see a character wait, okay
Actually, let's pitch the joke he makes to wolf see what wolf thinks. All right, so I can't actually remember what it is
I got it. I got it. So so mandalori meets up with this this crew that he's going to be doing
So, uh bill burr is a part of this crew
And he's all you know, like this is a crew. Uh, he you know, why is bill burr on the team?
And he has like a million guns. He has guns strapped to his chest. It's kind of embarrassing. He has like five guns
We'll just we can that's fine. It's great. Actually it helps many
He's got more guns than hands at one point. Someone takes one off his chest and he doesn't do anything about it
Just take it
It doesn't matter. So, uh, you you might be thinking to yourself like oh, well
What's the point in having five guns if you're not even a good shot? And so the boss guy is like nah, man
He's a great shot. He is an ex imperial
sharpshooter imperial meaning with the empire, right and then mandalorian
I can't remember if he says something specific but he gives him that there is an exchange that implies stormtroopers are bad aims
bad shots and then bill burr is like
I wasn't a stormtrooper. Yeah, he says I wasn't a stormtrooper smart ass
What do you think well so like well, okay your delivery was
Kind of catastrophic but the point of the delivery
I don't even think that's how it went. Yeah. No, he says smart. He says I wasn't a stormtrooper smart. Yeah
He says he says that at the end sure, but like the buildup is important. Okay, give me the do it
You do it better. Do it. I don't I don't even remember it. I just know that was
So you call someone else out?
I don't remember what the shape of italy is but if I saw it i'd know it was wrong
You can't no, no, no, no you if you can't make the last jedi, you cannot criticize it
I don't know what the hell is happening here. Okay. The point is the point is one
I couldn't make the last jedi if I tried two
That the mandalorian has confirmed in universe that stormtroopers not being able to shoot is an actual thing
Yeah, so like like he's like, oh i'm a pro i'm a pro imperial guy and then mandalorian's like lol
And then he's like I wasn't a fucking stormtrooper smart ass as if to say stormtroopers
Are canonically stupid and can't aim properly
Even though that's not a thing at all that actually exists the whole stormtroopers can't aim is built off of people not understanding
Specifically weren't trying to hit people in episode four. What do you remember?
Um, yeah, not only that you're right, but uh ob one says that they're like really fucking good. Do you remember that?
like imperial stormtroopers
Fucking terrifying
They will they will melt your aunt and uncle
They will fuck you up. So don't mess with them
So like it it it's frustrating
It was frustrating to me in ranks to to hear this acknowledged that stormtroopers suck
They are trying to they are is this disney?
This just their their latest greatest attempt to do what they can to chip away at the ot
Like remember the ot. Yeah shit
I suppose you like our new you could apply it to the sequels as well stormtroopers are in that too
Um
This sounds terrible. Why would I ever want to watch this? No, this was no, no, no wolf. No, no
No, this was only this was only but a taste. This was only but I was actually gonna say this episode was way worse than that
Yeah
And I want to clarify though. I thought bilboo was he did he did what he does
Bilbo was fine
I suppose I would say that for every actor actress actor person in all of the Mandalorian. Everyone's doing what they can, you know
Yeah, I don't I can't think of any bad actors
Can I don't think I can wolf can you think of any bad actors? Yeah wolf you've seen it. What do you think?
Yeah, what the fuck is happening?
We're asking you if you think there's any bad actors or actresses like bad faith actors in mandalorian
Other than Disney. Mm-hmm
As a whole yeah in the entirety
I don't I don't think there are any either
Literally all i've seen of the mandalorian baby Yoda memes
Baby Yoda's doing character. It's still consistent
Yeah, he is
Yeah, basically, uh, you know, it's funny me you
Sorry, wait. Yeah, no fringy metal me you we're the only look
I feel like we're the full people in this fucking universe that have the take that we have of mandalorian where it started good
It just got worse
Because everyone else seems to think that it started bad. It got good
Well, we can back ours up though. And then we talked with someone and he was we convinced him
So once you actually like get people into a discussion and say here's all the reasons why it's terrible
We're not saying you can't like it. You're saying here's why it's terrible the um
He like well for reference in episode
six
When we watched was six, right? Right?
The last one yes at six we're past the halfway point so he like gets a crew
In six for the first time he's not like ever worked with a crew and the crew consists of clancy brown, right?
Who if you don't know
The most well-known position I think people would know him from is he's the drill sergeant in starship troopers
He's quite cool. Every role he's in highlander. I don't know if maybe google clancy brown. You probably know him you got him
then you got um
Tonks what's her name is a is adora tongs from harry potter. She's also um
The wildling from game of thrones
You know i'm talking about
The girl one who turns good can help spran. What's her name?
Oh
I don't fucking know the game the show forgot about it
They brought it back to killer. Yes, you're right. But but her to them to build
In game of thrones, yeah
Spoilers how does she die? I don't even remember she tries to seduce ramsay boulton. He just fucking kills her
Oh osha. Yes. Yes. That's it
Oh, I thought you were talking about the other one like the girl that bran sent away and then she just never appeared again
Oh shit clancy brown was the voice of mr. Krabs. I didn't even know that
Mr. Krabs
Mr. Krabs is voiced by a woman
Oh
Clancy is a female name, right?
What's happening? Okay. So and the last person, uh is rich. Oh, sorry rich in iowad who?
Uh, I was watching dude rautics review of the episode and he says iowaid I think
And I don't blame him for it because it's such a fucking weird name. It's just like a collection of vowels
But um, the only reason I pronounce it that way is because that's what i've heard him say his own name as on panel shows
Can't wait to see who plays star fuchi. Yes, but uh, it was a really cool crew
I think in terms of actors and roles to play, you know, it could have really worked. I just didn't like the episode at all
There you go, we reviewed medlorian rex we did it
Oh, yay
Thank goodness. We got that done because I think people getting upset that we haven't talked. All right. Listen chat
That's finally caught up. First off. Fuck you clancy
Sounds like a woman's name. I would never name my son clancy
That's like that's like that's like nancy. Drew's sister clancy. You name your daughter clamps clampsy
I wouldn't name. I wouldn't I wouldn't name anyone clampsy
Maybe I would name like a tool like a like a wrench or something. I might name it clampsy
I wouldn't name a human being clamsy
Or clancy
I would just avoid it all together. Even if her sister nancy was going around solving mystery
I
Haven't said anything unreasonable yet
What have I said to son reasonable? No, I haven't I didn't say you said you have
You told the joke unreasonably and it killed the joke. It was hilarious. We both died laughing
Wait, hang on. I thought you didn't like the joke. I thought that was the point
I hope i'm not the only one that hasn't been just obscenely confused for the past 10 minutes
Do you guys want to go back to watching mean pictures? Is that it? Is that what you're saying?
Yes
All right
What was the point of our um, what actually was a little point of this um
To tell wolf that they made a joke about stone troopers being unable to aim properly in universe. It bothers me. Okay
Yeah
I'm glad we made it. So this is has been hotel again
Uh, this is actually not oh shit
it's uh
Fuck I forget what the title of it is. I actually liked it more than
Hotel, but it's from like the same team
You know this sea hell of a boss
Hell of a boss. Yeah, that's what it was
Yeah, I actually liked it a lot more than has been hotel thought it was a little bit more charming
Uh, why would anyone send me this?
I I don't remember the context of this specific scene, but I don't think it needs it
The important thing is rags of movie bob do not get on. Oh, I sent you the I swear to god. I copied it correctly
This is it's getting harder. Okay, that's all i'm gonna say
You got the daily
The major lease seal of approval contains images of women got 1.2
Billion readers. Oh my god voting has started for the biggest massive of 2019 which celebrity will win the popular vote
Only man to vote for jeb found at last i'm not political the anonymous man claims. I felt sorry for the guy
It seems that tonald has been missing. This is an old newspaper. Obviously. He has been found. Thankfully clearly
After three years of extensive research a lone person who supported the presidential bid of john ellis
Wait, is that why he's called jeb
Is it john ellis bush is that actually why he's called I thought it's just I just thought his name was jeb
I thought his name was just jeb because he's from texas and that sounds like something they do
Did they honestly why would you call him jeb instead of john? Is that true? Oh my god, john is a way better name than jeb
Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay
I'm gonna google this we need to know the truth. Where we got it. How do you think you're gonna just be a fucking bush?
John ellis jeb bush. Oh my god. I had no idea. I thought his name was jeb
Yeah, jeb is not my god
It actually makes
Not not that much sense, but slightly more sense. Why his why his why his slogan was jeb with an exclamation point
Because it stands for john ellis bush. That's terrible
But everyone says yeah bush which it doesn't make sense because the b and jeb is bush. So everyone's saying
bush
I
I kind of want to start calling him bush
Honestly this whole time I was under the impression that his parents had cruelly named him
I did too. Oh my god. Oh my god
Oh my god, it's not that they cruelly named him jeb
He
Incompetently calls himself jeb calls himself jeb
Can you imagine they had a board meeting and they concluded that was the best way to mark it?
Oh my goodness
And you shall be jeb how is it that we're finding out about this now like
Well, I just
I just assumed that it just it wasn't like an unreasonable name
I could have because I've just seen uh, i've seen that. What's the movie with christian bale plague? Um, yep. No
The guy who was with george bush
Oh
Chaney
But I could have sworn jeb was in that like portrayed in that movie and they referred to him as jeb
Just do you think this parent they would have called him jeb. Oh, that's like terrible
Like oh that's our that's our jeb
That's our little jeb growing up on the ranch what uh, you don't have to ask these questions
I just find it funny. What would your name be if it was just the initials of your name? Mine's the best
I think yeah, it wouldn't make any sense. Mine would be cunty
Oh my god
And for those who are like what the fuck do you mean my initials would be cnte so cunty
Okay
Can either view up what up me or if I got the winning vote there no mine is
Unpronounceable same with mine. Well
I'll take the victory on that i'm fine with it. That's what i'll run on definitely win president cunty
President cunty at least i'll say it to your face
All right
So john ellis jeb bush in the 2016 united
United states united states election has been uncovered by reporters working for the daily tism
The lone supporter was interviewed anonymously to uncover what alien mindset drove him to such a decision
The results will shock you
Uh having started by assuring his support had nothing to do with policy or leadership qualifications
He elaborated. I mean the guy's own mom said
On tv that he shouldn't get the post
Jeez, did you see his face? I figured I don't know what's best for the country
But maybe we could just help this poor guy get his way for once
new
New studies indicate that insomnia serves as a great fuel for memes. Oh
There you go
You did it here first
I'm assuming this is an allo meme
No
Ss leader heinrich cookie monster
appears jovial as he has sworn in and reveals he enjoyed coming to this
What the fuck is the origin of this? I have no idea
It's probably the arlo stream because he looks like cookie monster. I mean that was my guess but
What about the rest of it?
Oh, I always managed to bring up the holocaust somehow
All right, we got us another movie coming out um the 12 long days of efap
Will premiere december 11th at ace. Oh shit. That's already yeah came out four days ago
Hey, what you got in that? Uh, what you got in that that box for me mauler. Can I just highlight a massive?
orgiginal production
orgiginal
orgiginal orgiginal
We're gonna we're gonna see if uh, he really is the long man
I mean
Proof's in the pudding as they say
Wolf just uh casually into pizza there. Oh, I could go for some pizza right now pizza would be good. It sounds pretty good
It's not too late. I shouldn't eat that much pizza though because i'm trying well i've been i've been pretty good the last few
I might have a pizza. I think this is a rendition of diabeto
Just a couple pieces and then have the rest late. I don't know
Diabeto he's got the big d on his cake helmet
He's got a dial
He's feeding him insulin
Do you guys like that diabeto is infinitely more popular than movie bob will ever be like
Yes
Oh such a legendary meme
Let's see who the flute man really is it was massive j all along
Why would j have been the flute man? What is his motivation? What's the flute man, wasn't he?
Confluxious wasn't that the flute guy? Yes, they would be called confluxious, but why would it be j?
Um, I like you in the corner of saying kick j
I don't even need context exactly for this. I just like it
Oh my god
That's fucking horrifying
Oh my god, what is this fresh hell?
Do you like how the memes come in all shapes and sizes there's nothing in terms of limitations. Oh my goodness seasons greetings
What did we say on the alo stream i've completely forgotten
I forget like I remember the stream
But I don't think I remember
Anything relating to like going to prison or genocide?
That's just clearly
My memory clearly we fucked up
Because we had some strong beams and we've forgotten exactly what they were about chat probably knows
Uh, what we got next
Got some avengers tisms. Oh, no, this isn't avengers. This is oh, this is crisis on infinite earths
crisis on infinite jabs
Papa
We got jab dibito jabney don crisis on infinite jabs jab episode jab over jab
It's the end of the claps
Dude look at the one where he's running all beginning
He's firing a clap hat
Is that jay in the yeah, that's jay in the back
Oh jay just said apparently we made jokes about cookie mods to committing genocide. I honestly don't remember that
You think that would be what I wouldn't forget but I apparently yeah
Oh, oh there's total I don't even think this is an e-fap meme, but it's a great meme
Did yoda fuck
Yeah
You know, there's uh, there's that character it I didn't actually know it existed until very recent
Um, there was another yoda alien on the jedi council
I didn't know that until like a couple weeks ago. Yeah, she her kid's a brother, uh named utl
And you know what their you know what their favorite hobby is
Fucking no, yeah, no jesus
Fucking I was gonna say yodeling. I never hold on. I I never said that they were fucking each other
Yodeling
They're late for the jedi council
Sorry, I was uh doing some uh, uh, well push-ups of the closet real quick. That's all right. All right
Well, what about no anakin? You can't be a jedi master
Oh
Okay, all right
Ironically we are like a third of the way through picture memes
Rags we really need to remember this shit
Everyone remembers cookie monster genocide except for us
Very much out of the loop
All right. Someone's saying the cookie monster meme is a combination of arlo and the nick fuentes cookie analogy. Ah
Okay, that's triggering some memory. It's kind of all coming together
Yeah
Um splendimin splint
Yeah, I don't want to cut in the line but oh wait, what's that I need um as you walk down the street you hear
Man's voice say you look prettier
He smiled if you turn around and give him your widest grin revealing one inch bloodstain fangs vampires. Call me the dog
Is that a reference?
Vampires call me the dawn. Um
What is that app
Vampires call me the dawn we're deciphering this chat go. Yeah. What do we do chat assist?
Um
Is it um
I like that you just said chat assist like it was a fucking order in a video game
They do it. They're good. They know what their shit is. They have like a big old like they're like google
Oh, someone sent me the someone sent me the original of that picture
And it's terrifying
I've seen the original. Oh my god
It's terrifying
I don't think the vampire thing why did someone draw that like
Were they commissioned against the will
Possibly
Um
Wait to chat answer a question, I don't know. Um
Someone said wait, wait, wait splendor man would be the nemesis of diabetes, you know
um
Wouldn't he he could potentially be like working with him, you know, oh, it's this don is fatal to vampires
Is he
So that makes sense if he's a vampire hunter and he's called the don wait, why is it
Did we know because his name is don and don is deadly to vampires
Why is don deadly to vampires?
Because vampires can't be in the sun mauler
you watched vampire, uh
Drag count dracula, you know dracula untold we watched dracula and told you should be a vampire expert. Why is the don the sun?
No, no, no, no, no the da double
Oh the don right
I was waiting for one of you two to get it so I didn't look like a retard when I said I didn't do it
Oh my god
Yeah
That's what they call a racetism or sexism sorry gotta get it right
If someone's saying no the actor for the don is on blood and is a vampire
Wait, why would kill vampires? He is a vampire. That's lame though. Really don one is way better
Billed with self-hatred, I guess
My face when the leaks are real
That's why I was laughing she's like terrified but also hungry
Unironically like wolf. I don't know if you've seen that stream yet or not, but the leaks are insane
I've
Seen some of the leaks
Unlike reddit, but I haven't read all of them and I haven't seen the stream it
Like, you know, it sounds hyperbolic but rags like when we read those leaks doesn't it sound like someone trying to destroy star war
Literally sounds like it's the most batshit insane convoluted fetch quest across the galaxy that i've ever seen they have horses
Riding on top of star destroyers. It's the most insane thing wolf. It's going to be nuts. I can't wait
I can't wait to just use it as an excuse to just never watch star wars again
You
Got to watch this though because it's insane
Well, yeah after this it's like i've said it on twitter already in the past streams. It's like i'm pretty much done with star wars
I'm not a fan. That's not true. That's a lie because you gotta watch you're gonna watch the mandalorian. No, i'm not
Yeah, you are
I thought you said you'd already started watching it wolf
You said you not only you said you not you
Missed that you were going to start watching it
But that you were actually watching it at the moment in the back
Remember you told us about the bill burr comment and it annoyed us as well
Yeah, you explained the bill burr joke to us. So we thought it was terribly told sure
But even the point of the joke was terrible
I just I really feel like you're I really feel like you're kind of letting us down
Yeah, why why start the mandalorian not finish like why go halfway?
What though I have to admit watching episodes one three five and six is weird like why would you why?
What are you talking about
I feel like we can't rely on you. Yeah, I guess we'll just move on to the next picture meme. Okay mandalorian
All right next meme
Yo buffy that star wars the efap
All right
That picture was good, you know sad wolf is that uh
In that get together you can watch that video. It's like
Uh, uh, I think it's a 20 year anniversary for buffy. Um
Zander isn't seen in any shot with all of them outside of I think anya because all of them want to stay away from him
Because he's crazy
Oh my god, really?
Yeah, he like got into serious. He got arrested several times serious alcohol issues
Wait who?
It wouldn't you wouldn't know him. He's just one of the people in the picture. It's just sad
What
How do you know I wouldn't know him? Maybe we met I'm gonna bet 100 dollars on the fact that you do not know him
I'm gonna oh, yeah. Well i'll raise you i'll bet 200 dollars that I don't okay. I give up massive soft
Oh
Man that's rude that that really disappoints me. Yeah, I know it sucks. You went on dr. Phil
You can actually find it on on youtube. It's such a weird thing because I don't want zander to be on dr
Phil. I know I was like
I remember when I got told about it. I was like, what the fuck is he on dr. Phil? Like what?
I
Was weird weird weird things, um
He had like some really good shit. I mean, I like the character a lot. It sucks. I think that buffy was like his main
Consistent referring to him as zander don't actually know his fucking real name. Nicholas brendan. Oh
Raw the fuck you doing here? It's night. Hey, the sun is up somewhere
He just has to travel
Have you guys got my stream up because yes, look at the way that just filled the screen
McMuffin all right. Jeb, you know, what's up?
Wait, i'm trying to tell from the from the actual clip itself. How much of that?
Is that a little bit of a delay on the stream?
Is that all fake?
Like is the only original part of it just the closed mouth because wow
I see now. That's funny
Muffin McMuffin. I'm oh Eliza dusky wasn't there either. That's true. Yeah
Oh, oh, I didn't know the mouth moved
Of course the mouth moves
It's the mouthiest mouth that ever mouthed this is this is quite the meme you got
Bad joker takes most of your problems are caused because of a woman not not to
Not to take your bag meds
Joker hates
black women
Bisexualism and then it's bob's fault
Why bisexual I can't what's the origin of that?
I can't remember
You
So strange
Oh, hey, look it's the titanic relevant to our stream six hours until the streaming cap. My god
We'll never get through the super chats and then rah you massive
It's okay wolf i'll swim to new york
It's okay. Well i'ma swim to new york
That's some good shit
Not to mention how long it would take to make this meme. Look at this. You gotta cow all the super chats
Place them all on top of each other cut my head out on top of you. Good stuff. Good stuff
That's really good. Cannot go without appreciating a good meme
Tux on that tux off
It makes sense
Tex off is dead naming. Oh shit because has he cut his penis off yet?
I don't think so, but I think you can dead name without doing that
It's not about the money. It's about sending whites to chambers. Oh my god
Oh my goodness
And he's on the he's on the stairs
Robin so it's just take and someone just take the blur tool and just move it in a circle
So that it's large enough to be
That's like the laziest way of making a fat person i've ever seen
Is
It's like smudge it's smudge they took a smudge tool
No, i'm pretty sure that's not that's the uh, the stamp tool, isn't it where you
No, i'll here like if you because if you use a large enough smudge and you drag it out
It only does it once every so far on the image like once every so far for the pixels
So that's what it kind of looks like it i'm sure it's stamp not smudge chat answer this is it stamp or smudge?
I'll open gimp and i'll and i'll take a look. How dare you refer to me as a girl
I'll I'll gimp you
So
I'll get a picture here
Right. Let me get one of my one of my pictures, right? Let's drag that on the gimp
And yeah the smudge tool, so let's make the smudge tool tool big see i'm talking in terms of photoshop
Not this weird program that no one uses
Plenty people use gimp
So, okay, i'll i'll print screen this. This is what happens if you do it. I just did it for you
Jay said looks like smudge stamped smudge
Mudge stamp smudge smudge stamp stamps. We got oh, we got some conflict here
Okay
Well, if you say well, is it called something?
smudge smudge
stamp gimp
Not stamped
Rags is thick. I'm sorry. I had to read that out rag. I don't know if that's offensive. I just had to read it out
It's true. Smamp gimp jigolo had to read that out too. Uh long gimp bad
stampy smudgy
Same thing
Oh my god, could it be the same thing?
So
But there I showed you an image's proof of the effect
Yes, you're right
It does kind of look like it could have been done that way the way I would have if I was told to replicate
This image I would have used stamp
Um moving on however, we've got um pranks is missing
on a rhino milk
Oh, you can you can change the rate and the flow so if I take the
I'm missing
Oh, no, I I I hope I find myself. I think you're fired. That's a really like it
Oh, this is the really cool image that we've talked about before I think
It's so you got yeah, you got uh wilford brimley who famously says diabetes
And with the x you've got
At first you might think it's the same guy but in the x is diabeto
They fit together so well
Yeah
It's a really good picture
That's actually crazy. They really do their faces are
That that's almost like the same person. Just I will say this
diet diet bob diet b bob diet
Diabeto has a better mustache than
Wilford Brimley in terms of grooming by the looks of this picture. Just saying just saying like rags. What do you think?
Is Wilford Brimley still alive? That's the common question people ask. Yes
He is red letter media often are shocked by this because he was an old man like 30 years ago
And he's still wilford. Brimley is 85. He is currently alive. I can't believe that
He's alive, but he's got yes. All right
Yes, how guess how tall wilford brimley is seven foot one?
Well i'm guessing five four really yeah, he's five eight
So I was a short man. Yeah, he's not a very tall man. Woohoo. He's shorter than me. He's a wide man though
Oh wait, when it says all right
Make sure that wasn't it always surprises me that he was in the thing. I'm always like shit, man. He was in the thing
He's still taller than tom
Hey, man, tom cruise is in some good ass movies like michias is five seven
Tom cruise is a short man. He is a short man
How tall are you regs?
How what how tall are you?
How tall am I? Oh god, here we go. Yes
I don't I don't I don't I kind of I don't know i'm
I'm about i'm tall. Well, you measure me at the shoulders about 17 18 inches
How tall is your human now tall as my human oh he's like 5 10
Uh, oh
That's all you wolf. I forgot
5 10
So I believe I believe fringy is the tallest of the long men. Um, I yeah, he's a fucking giant
Fringy sways in the wind when there's a song bro. He's six five. I am six four. So me and fringy would be long
What six foot two what is in the water in welshland wherever you're from? Well fringy's from australand
So obviously whatever's in my water is in his water as well
Oh my goodness
Everyone's like rangs is a manlet like no i'm 5 10. That's
That's not short. You know how it works women say anything below six foot automatically disqualifies average male height five feet nine inches
I am one inch above average. Hey
That's what that's what jeremy says about his penis above average penis. I have an above average penis. Hmm
That's where it matters
Yeah, fuck the average is like well, it's a lot bigger than average manlets btfo
That's disgusting. Jay. How tall are you? Are we all taller than our manager?
Oh, yeah, by the way, I just want to clarify I can extend myself to thousands of feet at will obviously
Destiny is 5 8
You have to bring that up
I just thought of short people and he came to mind. What are you sure people are short, but how could you say it like that?
That's so offensive
Jay how tall are you?
Should we all put bets on it before you make it? I gotta guess 410. Oh, he's six six foot. Oh his birthday
He's lying. Jay. Honestly, I would have guessed five foot
Yeah, but you're like a lanky six feet you you're yeah, dude, if he's six foot
Rocks in your pockets when it's windy outside so you don't blow away
I feel like you could like punch him and you would break it off
You're like, um, he's like gumby where he's really thin, but he's tall
Y'all y'all og's in the chat remember gumby
Am I the only motherfucker here he's talking about gumby and everyone else is quiet because they don't remember gumby
I don't know who the fuck you're talking about. You don't know about gumby
No, it sounds like something you just made up no it isn't yeah y'all know about gumby
But gumby was a real thing. He had a horse for a friend
Oh my god pull gumby dude, I actually remember this this is it because a dude dressed up as this for his dog
And his dog went crazy
Pull gumby
This is from like the 50s and 60s fuck your old rags, I don't know
No, i'm not an oldman
70 years old I guess
Thank you so person in chat, thank you ramo gray wolf
How can someone said I legit live under a rock because I don't know what gumby is how could you say that what jay is
Yeah, let me say it out of clay. That's like his thing
jumbo jumbo is clay
Why is it was a tv show a clay character, how many of those were there oh stop motion was great
Did I miss stop motion? Did either of you guys see carline?
I never finished it. That's good shit. That's good shit
Oh
Anyway, yes, it's true that jenny nixon being a tism doesn't really alert us but jeb bush man. That is straight to our hearts
good meme
Um
So this was someone submitted a meme
Where they had the thing with a cow that was like super thin and we were milking it for batwoman
And we corrected them saying that batwoman is like an infinite source of milk
And so they corrected the meme
It's much more accurate now
They even added the cow or well what what do you call that a cow a maid? I don't know
I I really like how the guy is the efap colors. Yes
The colors have spread to his arm and back
Um
I don't I don't know
See the animu ones i'm lost so you got
Movie bob. I I fire a blast at him and he explodes. I don't know what
What this is what animu is could it be pokemon slash something completely different?
It could be pokemon or digimon
Digimon is it digimon digital monsters? Oh, they have the better theme, but they just suck
Oh
It's a pretty controversial take there I mean
It's a it's a worthless take because I never watched it. I just knew the theme. No, I know it was worthless
Okay, but I said it was worthless before you did so you can't just say that
I'm gonna distance myself
I'm glad that on my screen wolf is in between us because I wouldn't I wouldn't want to be staying well on my screen
You're right next to me, buddy. So say we gotta say what's up with digimon, huh?
What's happening with digimon? Oh man
thinking
So who think of a digimon had a better theme song than pokemon?
Is that controversial? Really? That is how it was more catchy. Okay
More catchy sing it
You just did it. There's the did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it?
Yeah, that's catchy
Not like you're like the x-men tv show
First off it's not catchy people haven't heard that song and you are that's racist wolf back me up how racist he's being
Wolf, no explain to mauler that the digimon theme song isn't nearly as good as the pokemon theme song
I want to be the very best no one ever come on. I said catchy. Okay
I'm clarifying that it's catchy not necessarily better, but I know theme songs. Oh, do you know the theme song of pokemon or digimon?
You don't know the theme song of pokemon, you know, you know the theme song of pokemon who doesn't know that
I I don't even I didn't even know digimon existed until just though. What gotta catch them
Digimon was like, hey, we're cool too, but they weren't
No, I I wasn't aware
See there was me thinking that everyone knew about pokemon and digimon i've been living in a different world
I like this meme. It's so accurate
Oh, yeah, that is true
I've told baby yoda is still the most consistent character of mandalorian. Just saying put it out there
What's the consistent character of disney star wars?
Yes, what about k2so
Oh, yeah k2so was pretty it's k2so and baby yoda best characters of disney star wars
Huh
She's like micky d just said what are you people? I think that's in relation to the digimon conversation
I like this meme, by the way
Is
The guy is sweating
How do you pitch efap to anyone ever what what does one do it would have to be a compilation
So this is kind of terrifying in a way just for the style I don't really know what's happening I just got sent it, okay
In jeb we trust oh my god, you're reading lord of the rings I got that
What was this made with crayon digital
I could smell this picture
Smells it smells like play-doh
Oh, I know what you mean I know that smell yes, I know that smell yeah, man
I was gonna say why smells like
Like, you know that that friend you you go over to their house
So you just like every time you walk in you're like you wrinkle your nose and you're like, why does my friend smell so weird?
What's rags up to but the bob there what's he doing?
I'm clearly sick from all the play-doh i've ingested I thought it was
It's I don't oh my goodness
Oh
This is all right, I guess we'll have to sink
kind of
This is this is a reddit post. You guys have to click this to open it up
And it's a video, okay
Um boy, oh, yeah. Okay. Wow. Look at this. So you guys at zero
hold on it's uh
Okay, let me turn my volume on
All right, ready? All right, i'm there three two one go
Got wolf and me just i'm just having a dance as you do
Who's in the picture?
I don't know. I don't think it's that complicated. I think this is sims and it's just me and you
I don't know if there's a rags here. Oh god, where am I going? You're probably going to eat some pizza. Yeah fat fuck
Man i'm really into this song
That's a proper elevator
This is my jam yo
Oh, yes, i'm into this
See wolf thinks i've like died or something
He's probably i'm probably in the back
We're trying to find an argument. Yeah, i'm winning an argument. Oh my goodness
sped up sped up a little bit. Yeah
I haven't played sims in so long
I've never played sims. No, huh?
Have you played sim francs?
I have not no damn. I live it. I live it every day. No, i've played sims on the ds
One of the comments says this is satanic
That makes sense played. Um, what was it called? Um
Oh
The sims 2 on the ds
It was the alien what a strange platform to play it on was it good
Yeah, I don't I can't tell maybe I was just I mean, I enjoyed it, but I was young so I might have just been stupid
I I I think it wasn't good, but I found some strange
Bestial attraction to it and this most surface level because you could make little songs and one of the songs was called disco
blitzkrieg and you could make all the things happen and
Just reminded me that guitar hero was on ds
I had rock band unplugged on the psp the sims now. I kind of wanted out sims 2 ds
Music
So
All right, but next meme, uh efap episode 52, I think this is when we were covering the closer look because it says epic epic
epic epic
My advert senses are tingling
You know, my my my fingers seem to be morphing in with my nose, but i'm okay with this
It's having a big thong
This is um, I feel like we should have
Shown this already if we didn't if we did already. Oh well, but it's um, it's the pixel rendition of the bob episode
We've even got j long bone writing ranks
Well now i'm jealous of j long bone
Um
Man this is like a trip down memory fucking lane. I don't even know what i'm dealing with right now. What is this?
uh, I hereby announce that you are objectively a
Husband and wife and i'm marrying
um
Um egg you look like an alien
I'm, okay with that i'm confused about who i'm marrying
Um, it looks like an egg
In one of those russian dolls, what are they called like patryvshka dolls patryoshka, uh russian doll
They're called rioska doll
Matryoshka doll shinoble dolls
Also also known as babushka dolls. Oh, yeah
Uh
Matryosh
Very fine if I may say
I think diabetes should get this movie. That's my opinion. Um access to tbs.twin.com was denied
I can't that link leads me to a place that i've been denied apparently no dogs allowed on tbs.twin.com
Wolf, you know the x-men cartoon tv show theme, right? That's right. Just ignore my no
Rags, you know it, right?
The x-men tv show theme. Yeah
Um, yeah, I think so do it
I'm i'm trying to give me a second because I remember it like wasn't like
Oh, then the one their part that went like delude deero delirnero
It's the one that goes
Do
I might have been confusing it with the spider-man, uh song
Oh man, that show was fun. I remember watching that shit
but the only thing I know about the
the
tv show is a clip I saw where
um
Someone takes down magneto with a wooden gun and he's like, how did you take me down?
And he explains that the gun is wooden and it's like
It's like magneto. Why don't you just kill all of them now then?
Yes, people are saying that spider-man. Yeah, I went to the youtube and
Um, you tried to cheat and you failed
No, no, it wasn't cheating. It's like these are these are shows that I haven't seen in many many many
Oh, you haven't seen it in a while. So that means you don't remember it quite clearly. That's that's an excuse both of them
That's an excuse and even even when I even when I hummed it I said, I think that might actually be the spider-man one order
Uh pokemon digimon x-men spider-man those four themes from besto list
Um
Pokemon is number one. All right followed by
Spider-man then x-men then digimon
So i'm gonna i'm just gonna say x-men beats them all that fucking theme is fantastic
It was good. Then, um, I love the pokemon theme, but I found digimon to be more catchy. That is my position
I stand by it
Oh, so you think that syphilis is a better disease than cancer because it's more catchy
Well, that's a complicated discussion because what makes the better disease the one that is more catchy or the one that is
Uh, whatever the other thing was
Pretty sure I asked you that based on what you said was your
disease that is more catchy be the better one
No, it is the superior disease. I'm not saying it's good morally
So the best disease is the one that knocks out and kills itself immediately. Yeah
The best disease is the the disease that doesn't exist at all I feel like communist
The only good communist is a dead communist communist can spread like a sexual disease
They can't spread like a fucking sexual disease
Yeah, everyone's like oh you feel really bad like listen, I think that spider-man and x-men I think they're both really good
I really like them. This is just subjectively me ranking them. I know that digimon's at the bottom
Oh people some people are putting digimon right at the top. Oh, it's all right if people are wrong in chat
How can chat be wrong? It's always right and it always has a unified opinion. There's never any difference
Look, everybody's agreeing on the exact same thing. There's no difference
I don't even know what to make of this. I guess it was human scooby. And then we look at human rags based on rags as doggo
I understand this man. Yeah, not bad rags
Yeah
I got that. I got um
I have a quite the quite the physique
Yeah, I got that
I got um
I have a quite the quite the physique
He's a curious
Scooby versus the chad rag. So this is uh shad versus the great emu king with tiger snake arms
This is a great emu. Okay, this is a photo realistic image
Uh, he did indeed commit to this battle and won
The place he fought him in was the the zone of black and white
Caca
Yeah, pretty crazy emus with tiger snake arms
I don't want anyone to say that's not real. It's very real. Uh
next up we got
Look at women. So major lee absolutely destroying this argument
And the straw man says I wasn't making a particularly good point. Anyway
As if the straw man just wants to die. It's like oh well
Yeah
That was the uh the plague creations, uh video where he like beats the shit out of the straw man
We're all just like hey, how you doing?
We're over here if you want to hang out
Surprising how much the straw man has become useful in explaining positions. Oh the straw man. This is the nuke sword
very good
This was uh, the arlo stream in which what would it look like to have a nuke sword?
That looks pretty good. Would that be dangerous? Like would it affect you or do you have nuke immunity with the nuke sword would be dangerous
Well, I could see the radioactive fumes
Yeah, but if i'm assuming you're immune to anything that comes from the nuke sword yourself like because you're the user
I don't know. That's my opinion
Yeah, I don't know. I feel like just my body in general isn't
Isn't you know, we radiation and I we don't get along that well
Someone put elsa jean in chat and so i've been looking up elsa jean pictures and
Uh, she's uh, she's a she's a what is that lovely lady was elsa jean. Elsa elsa's frozen star. Oh, okay
Yeah, she's got some she's a
pretty good looking
Got some nice tits
What was the video we covered where the person said they love rocks?
Love rocks. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm
I don't know. I think it might have been the video from um
the potential like the potential subjective
Uh rating of the film is based on how many rocks there are. I think that's what there might be
I think and then we said that you could actually get an objectively pretty strong game that was all about collecting rocks
And it was all accurate to like how rocks work and then like categorized into very specific high
high detailed systems of rocks, uh
Like death stranding but with rocks
So here's the thing chat you say don't mock him for not knowing who elsa jean is
I didn't know who elsa jean is. I don't know porn stars by name. I didn't feel blocked by ranks
I felt no the chat. So I was like, yeah, right mauler. You don't know
Like I don't know the name porn stars
Like I don't like I don't I don't specifically look and follow their careers like oh a lot of work tips look today
You're like, no, I just I just go with the porn
Do you remember captain manpower? Oh, no, that's right. I'm a furry
I only look at furry porn and I know all the characters names
I'll read all the comics and I make sure that my porn furry porn lore is up to date
And I always use the right pronouns
Ranks, do you remember do you remember captain manpower?
We said like the goodness totally masculine crazy opposite feminist hero who
I believe we said he throws meat at people
He has like power drills attached to it. He has a barbecue attached to his back. I believe
Fucking don't mess with captain manpower. Oh my god, I forgot about this
I believe this is original artwork as well
It is with the isle of man flag. Yeah, that's what gives away
See if ever you guys make like original artwork
That's amazing. You gotta make sure we can tell because I for a second thought like oh this must be like
some image of
Nazi vision of several like the muppets but that gives it away the isle of man flag
There's some there's some good rat right there
So this is very good I believe this is us trying to assault the the the entity that is
uh movie bob
I appreciate that he's wearing a bra. That's actually very thoughtful of him
But uh, he's throwing meat at us. We're trying to assault
This creature. I don't think he he it's almost it's weird because he is like a meat volcano. Uh-huh. Uh-huh
And he's throwing yeah
Terrifying to say the least. Uh, this is meat and not shit
Well, it's got bones sticking out of it. You're just you're oh my god
Oh
Oh, what a disgusting human how watch that's your opinion that's not based on any kind of standard
Just some any image here more with uh with that infinity gauntlet
And on the gas mask portion, I believe it says like one x meaning nine and three
93 that would be the name. I usually went by good shit. Good details. Yeah, it's a cool one. I like the yeah, I like that
Nine and three molar nine nine nine and three molar is nine three I like this
Oh that is cool, uh, you drew
Um
Besides it is oh I was supposed to show the gift first wait mix a gift. Oh, there's a gift
I believe so
Sorry, i'm looking. Oh, it's it's tough to know else a gene right here
So if you click this or at least play this I think you get a you get a video. It's like
Wait, let me go back to the beginning. It's when an obstacle seems insurmountable
Uh
Just remember they survived the movie
Hey
Mostly it looks really good. I like that how it's different angles on it
It's really good
Another rendition really animated with his you know arms up like that
Oh
It's like a gelatinous cube he's very attractive in the jelly world I believe yeah in the jelly world he's less nasty looking
In the jelly world he's very welcome do you see
Oh, this was so if you remember rags we uh, we covered a mr. Stuckman's video
And he said that like he had the characters lament upon the idea of a rolling pin enemy
That would how ridiculous that would be
Someone created the idea of jerry the rolling
Oh my goodness, it's not impossible guys. All right
You know what a good last name would be for him
sprayer
Baker cherry baker
Because this is using a rolling pin as a weapon. I you know what I gathered that I got it
Yeah, so his last name could be baker the uncanny efap
You got wolf as roshak
Uh, oh look we've got musicians there flute musician
Wait a second jay log mode can shoot lasers out of her eyes. Why are you cyclops?
Two cyclops on the team
Wait, so that star wars gill is mr. Bad hat on my oh no mystique
I guess mystique. Mm-hmm. I'm wolverine and diabeto is of course throwing jelly cubes at us
Wolf your hat looks like it's smug
Huh looks like your hat is smiling smugly
How you see the eyes in the little mouth
Uh, I don't know the mouth is supposed to be the little the the thing
in the middle that
The thing
I don't know what you're talking about. I'll show you i'll show you here like I highlight it rags. You can do it here
I see the eyes. I don't get the smug smile part
It's the fucking thing in the middle the rags supposed to get the red box around the mouth
No, I know what you I know what you think the mouth is. I just don't see how I know the mouth is
I
Understood what's the smug part of it though?
That's the expression that is what isn't the smug part of it
It just looks like two eyes and a comma
All right rags you've been betrayed it's like it's like a smug anime face
I
That doesn't look anything like that does fringy back fringy back me up
What what no fringy's on my side fringy what the context is this fringy you agree with me, right?
Fringy fringy you agree with me on this. Come on
And and me wolf is the odd man out true. No, he's gay. Oh, what's what's this story?
What are you doing? Help me out? I can't
All right, so in the image that says do you see the uncanny efap image?
Yes, okay. Look at wolf's hat
Yeah
Uh, yeah, doesn't it look like a smug face?
Um, I don't know it looks like a trilby
That's that's all I could say. Yeah, I know I know I know what it is
But who is the hat and i'm thinking a smug anime face
You think the hat has not even an anime face just a smug face
I mean, I guess I can see two eyes there. Yeah
One of them is insulted
At a 45 degree angle a little bit and the other one's sort of flat which gives it a little bit of a crazy
Look more so than anything
Um, I don't know what to make of the shadow at the bottom though
That's what's throwing me off
It looks like a comma
It does look like a comma. Does it look like a comma or does it look like an impost?
Hmm, I don't know. It looks like a comma. I I mean I haven't seen this picture before so I was a little bit distracted by the man teddy
Underneath the donut there
You want to know why because it's up high it's on his hat it's up high and apostrophes are up high
Yeah, but it's like below the eyes, but was above the eyes. I think I might agree with you there
But why would a smile be above the eyes fringy?
I
Don't know but it's it's I don't even i'm not even conceited that it is a smile at this point
It doesn't look anything like a smile. Yeah, and yeah, I think I'm on the side of this one. Yeah
I'm using my judgment to tell me you're wrong. Maybe if you're used to mouths being
flipped
That's art an art is subjective entirely entirely entirely 100 percent
There's literally no
Okay
Yeah, that's what we're about
That's what the efap podcast is. So you're willing to accept his eyes, but no mouth. Am I am I getting that right?
Well, I mean i'm not really willing to accept anything to be honest with you
This picture definitely looks like it's a smug face
I show show this picture mauler show show this pic the one here the one that we talked about
Why don't we just post that to chat?
Oh they I put it on full fucking screen. They can see it
Every single one of them agrees. It's a smile. There's not a single person who doesn't
It looks like a smug face
Yeah, let's see someone just posted the smug face how how is that not that exactly
I don't know what this hold on. Look at that chat. Yeah chat chat. Thank you chat. You glorious
Absolutely, you know, what's up chat. I love it. Yeah. Yeah, if the smile was tilted 45 degrees
It doesn't look like the smut face at all you're just
It doesn't look like it at all. Come on. Are you shitting me? It doesn't look like it
It's the first thought is like look at how far up the mouth is tilting. It's like he's been in a car crash
It does not resemble it in its entirety
Yeah, that's a pretty impressive
No, that's that's that's a that's that's what you sound like right now people are posting the uh, the
What are you fucking what do you call them quotation marks with the slash?
That looks more like it
I didn't look like it. No, don't look the same rags. I don't know what to tell you
Okay. No, no, no, hold on
Fucking moving
Okay, hold on. No, this is what it looks like it definitely looks like it no close here
I'll make you do your link
Or injure or injure or whatever
This stream is never gonna end free. That's okay
We've still got nine hours remaining so we're fine. See chat. Why are you taking a picture? Do you mean that?
No, we already have nine hours remaining
See
Oh, okay
You just keep saying like oh look at it it's definitely that
Why would why would rags need to say anything else when it comes to the truth?
Quite frankly now, let's move along before let's move along before wolf
Baron i'm i'm okay with moving along if you wish
I bet wolf that i bet hey wolf is a hat a clothing or an accessory
Wolf that's the question
Hold on I i'm gonna need your definition on accessory in this i'm gonna need you to answer the question
I can't answer the question if i'm not really certain how to define accessory in relation to clothing
uh
Because but my first thought is accessory, but I don't know if i'm right
What what fringy is a hat?
Clothing or an accessory. I don't know what I don't know what the definition of clothes is
Fucking definitions. Oh, I gotta
According to wikipedia a hat is a head covering
Okay, okay
Accessory the definition of accessory is a thing that can be added to something else in order to make a more useful personal
To make it more useful versatile or attractive. Oh
So really all clothes are accessories then because no clothes are clothes and accessories are
Based on that definition. That's not true. It's fashion accessory. It's right under here on the wikipedia for fashion
Yeah, a fashion accessory. Yeah fashion accessory. What other accessory would it be?
It could behave super different accessories. It doesn't even say it's clothes
Is a watch yes, it does it literally says where is the outfit as types and it has watches here
It says the where is the outfit? How is a cane a clothing? What do you mean a cane is a clothing?
Cane is not a clothing
Well, maybe maybe it is who knows
No, how can you wear a cane like clothes cats and dogs i'm living with each other on an expedition
This cane will keep me warm from the elements. Yeah will because i'll spin it around really fast
My finger that i'm spinning it with
If you spin the cane around really fast, that'll just create a fan it will
You fly away and you're like i'm hotter now
What if it's nighttime and you're flying toward the abyss of space
You got whoa, i mean, i don't know what to tell you man like you guys aren't amping stuff
You can survive in space like layer
Yeah, that's the acumen cane
Use the force spin the cane really fast hold your breath for like 10 years and get to the moon. That's no
What?
Wolf look everyone
Did you know that the surface temperature of the moon on like the bright side is actually really hot?
I'm gonna even confirm that that's your opinion
Why don't you just use the cane to fly to the nearest
Store that has a yeah, this is what it says temperatures can reach 127 real degrees
So I was right. Fuck you guys. Yeah, the sun. Okay. Wait, the sun does exist at night
But if you're flying up at night time, you're not hiding toward the sun
Does it exist at night? Well, it depends. No, it doesn't depend on shit. If it's nighttime and you're flying up
You're not flying toward the sun. No, no, no, no if you if it's nighttime
Then you use like earth's gravity as a slingshot to get to the sun. What the fuck?
That's
What do you mean? What that's like? I okay
This is you are you're not a scientist. I'm not gonna take this seriously. I don't know what to tell you man
Scientists use mister you get hotter when you go to the sun. But what if it's nighttime? You're not going to the sun at all
Are you?
What do you mean? You're not going to the sun going to these guys are actually oh my god
It's surprisingly hard to go to the sun
No, this is nasa. This is nasa saying nasa said it's not easy to go to the sun
Really that's not
It's because are people telling me the sun exists at night. I know
You know, we know that is not up for
We all agree on efap that the sun does indeed exist at night
It does not mean if you fly up at any position or across the planet you end up with the sun. That's a big sense
No, no, you see the sun phases out of existence when the lights turn off. This is basic science
Well, no
If you subscribe to the whole simulation theory, then I guess the sun. Oh, we're all in the matrix
But even in the matrix will they had a son i'm just asking questions. All right, they had a son in the matrix
Even if it's a simulation the planet still spins in that simulation like there are people yeah another matrix the machine's blocked out the sun
Galaxy brain to the conversation. We'll get to the bottom of things. What does ocean man say about the sun ocean man?
He needed the tides. So he needed the moon. Fuck the sun
What the fuck did this conversation start? How do we look all this important is fringy did agree that it does look like a smirk face
Okay, we're good
There's a picture on imger
And it's it's there for everyone to see and I don't say I don't know what to say
It looks like the smart face
It looks like the smart face if it was put in like a cap if you know when they make patterns in your coffee
It looks like the smirk face was put in your coffee and then let to like sit for like exactly
Nailed it. That's three to two three. No, no, no. I'm not saying it does look like the smirk face
Liquid and this is the distorted again, this is this is the distorted like, you know
Someone from a country that doesn't exist who agrees with me and someone who's not actually
So he's a confirmed liar if anything this hurts your case
I was gonna say you said he came from a made-up universe. That means he's not even real
There's two liars on my team. And if you have two liars, they cancel each other
One big truth. No, that's still only one vote for yes. So you just took away a yes for you
No, because it's a double player together then it's like four one times one is one
That's true. That's true. That is true rags knows what he's talking about here. He's right
Oh, yeah, well if you multiply our votes together one times one is one so ha yep
Oh, i'm sorry. I thought you realized I was joking
Time for joking nope
Okay, serious business how
Of course when you start to lose, it's a joke you think nine hours into a stream
We're gonna start joking. Is that what you think? I get to be so sleep deprived to go into this fucking
Hey, should we move on to the next one?
Yes, unironically, this is pretty awesome. It's from stratum. I think it's from stratum. Let me try stratum. So
No, cid nicolson. Sorry cid nicolson. He's he's another talented artist. So he's got this is completely original
He got diabetes. Oh, he's consuming a burger a hot dog several tortilla chips with cheese and peppers
Donut donut donut donut donut donut and then you got toxic brood comics back there
So he's he's in his basement apartment. Not a basement a basement apartment
He is targeting a quite he's typing he's got you now motherfucker
Marble gold out. Don't forget to take out the garbage. Oh fired and he thunks it into the fucking garbage can
There's even you can see there's a there's an eaten apple and a and a soda of maybe a milkshake
The elevator music is still running
Oh
God forbid I think many people think that this is 100 serious. That would be terrible
He's also got a little keychain that has tlj on it
I like that. Um the belt is struggling to
Retain the fat as it rolls over the sides
I like his tricycle
Yeah, and so this is the opening of him defeating professor exercise who is obviously going to be quite the
season finale if you will
So this meme
I know I showed you guys this because I loved it, but the the the origin of this meme was me saying that um
the guy we covered who said that um
Every youtube show has to be pitched to a producer before it can be made. I said I was pitching efap to these youtube executives
Why are the executives me and er well because you became a manager you were like, yeah, i'm gonna invest oh, yeah
I'm gonna invest in the other
You know, er, I guess er approved of it. You just didn't want to you know, become a manager. That's that's a fair choice. I think
Who's the third one? I don't know. We got five five brains here and chat. Who is the fifth guy?
Wait five brains and chat
Well chats like 17 brains all in one. I think that might be susan. Oh
Oh susan wouldn't have approved of efap
Yeah, well it came down to a vote and two out of the three voted yes, not just your opinion
Vote yes to efap, but yes, I like this image it amuses vote. Yes for efaps independence
We got see before the stream everybody before the stream inside
We had rhino milk the don and spider oracles were all there to begin with two of which were memes that were created
Quote unquote by the manager, but it looks like I created them in my blackboard whiteboard
Presentation jay. What do you have to say?
I mean you guys know that I mean, I mean people know that this is all like acting right?
None of this is all staged. This is all what they call it
Exactly. None of all this is staged. I agree
It's all staged
So this is I believe sid nicholson once again, there's the cover of a new comic. Uh, fuck i'm hot
Tism the titans of intergalactic space magic from the efap fanatical universe
The stamp says i've been hacked
Titans of intergalactic space
Ironically, this is a great comic cover
Yeah, that's a really cool cover the return of wolf and you even got a qr code just in case you guys want to
Do whatever that does. I I mean what are qr codes on comics tend to do?
They're on hold on. They probably is these yeah someone someone needs to look that up because that might be a thing
No, let me check my shelf. Uh, I got a whole bunch of bot codes
Oh
Qr code
Can someone scan that qr code to see what it is? Why can't I scroll over? Oh, is this as far as it goes?
Where's the qr scan your qr code?
I'm trying to get it on screen. There it is. I got a qr scanner. Hold on
Uh, it says sid nicholson.com. Yeah, that's cool
He's a goodman he made he made the splash out he was fucking fantabulous
Yesterday I found out that there's a porn site called black tism
Well, um, let's take a look
That's your immediate reaction black tism.com black tism
It says black conservative intellectuals in modern america oh god really
Oh because of conservatism is why it's showing up. Oh, oh
For me. It's just monster black cocks for cute white teens
Coming from you it's
Manager you're not supposed to say such things
Oh
I can say whatever one choose to say true
Oh, and this is like a um
What is this this reference is a specific animu
But me being so uneducated. I don't actually know which animu you guys are out of new ish like jojo or something
That's a motherfucking jojo reference jojo it is but yeah pretty fantastic. I love it
Um, if I was to appear in an anime i'm okay with this being the rendition
They went with black tism
Well, I didn't get it hey you want to be original
Maybe it waits the results based on stuff that you normally watch which is why it popped up
Do you actually get like
This is the url. Is this where you went and got like conservatism stuff?
No, oh wow
Conservatism i'm not clicking that for the stream. Just FYI like to enter for videos. I mean, yeah, you probably shouldn't
Is who knows what will happen? I don't even want to click it on my computer. There's only one black penis on the screen
No, only one. All right
Don't click it. No, I won't yeah, i'm not that risque as they say
risque
risque
Also that actually does it for the first portion of efap images, how do you guys feel?
Oh god, that's just the first portion the first portion. How many portions are there?
I like it. How when when mauler says oh, I don't know what anime that is chats like oh, it's this what it's this what it's this what it's
Knows exactly what it is. Well, yeah, because our audience is filled with weaves like you you knew this
And so begins the the meme of the next portion ryan brought them together now it's up to them
Efap versus the legion of videos. Oh
Someone I was gonna say but I can't say yeah, I can say to you guys off stream. I shouldn't have said that
There's something interesting. I want to tell you all you have to remind me
Just say it really just say it really quiet. I don't think that'll work because it'll still be live
Just type it in the discord chat. No, no, just just like a whisper
Well, no because I don't want to risk you saying it and then I betray the confidence of someone else
All right. Okay. Oh fine. Fine. Fine. Break it up into parts and send each one of us one of the words and then we'll
No rags don't do the plot of arrival just tell us what it is
This is the plot of arrival this is the plot of the funniest joke
The rifle was great. No, I destroyed in that debate. Damn wolf. How do you feel?
That sums it up. Hey am one bowler
It comes with memes
A critique of the force wakers every favorite pause a critique of the last jedi meme meme. I I'm not against this but oh
Uh, do they have wolf not wolf rags on there like, you know, like a lady that they paint on the on the plane
That's great it's on the second image behind the uh, the propeller. Oh, yeah
Okay
Genuinely as springy jay. Thank goodness you guys are here so you can actually share how good this meme is
I've seen what makes you cheer
See that's so
I don't know that i've ever seen that joke be made
And this is what I want to reference as like clever jokes for rick and morty then people like oh, yeah
You have to be smart to get it. It's like I don't know. I just think that it's clever
Like your booze be nothing because i've seen what makes you cheer. That's good shit
I'm making a video on this
Right now trying to justify that should be making it now and that's why i'm i'm procrastinating by being on efair
We'd be getting very annoyed at the bad rick and morty takes like oh rick and morty is not that good
Rick and morty tells you that bad people are good
I saw i've seen
The worst rick and morty take ever it's from renegade cut. Oh, no. I sent free. I sent this
No, I didn't I I've been recommended
Free I sent you a message yesterday saying you want to see the worst video on the internet
Oh, yes
Oh boy
I saw the rick and morty thing where they had all the sex dragons and it was funny. It is funny attention citizens of drag on
a slut dragon has escaped
Unironically rags, I would I would watch all of it with you at a day
Just because of how easy it is to binge that show would just just just it'll be fun
Just to get you in on the thing to do some afternoon
I'd I'd be down for that because that's the thing like I haven't seen any rick and morty yet
Except really how long does it take to watch the whole show at this point? Is it literally like like it's like three hours
Yeah, it's really not a lot of season basically. So it's probably like very quick. Very fun
Hmm. I mean I watched it all like preparing for
Uh, did I sort of making a video?
Um, I watched all preparing for that and it took me like we all made it was like half a day at most
Well, are you gonna defend rick and morty from the people who say that rick and morty are advocating for bad people?
Actually, i'm just gonna make a video talking about why it's good
I'm not i'm not responding to i'm gonna throw any shade, huh?
I might I might um pop in a clip from that quinton video
Where he's the video was really bad
He basically said that the show espouses that rick's viewpoint is the viewpoint that you should adopt
And his proof of this was playing rick's clips over and over again. It's like yeah
Yeah, i'm not playing like morty's clips or any other clips contradicting rick
Because if rick says it it means it's true. Do you mean to tell me that quinton is disingenuous?
No, no, no, I think he believed what he said
Yeah, that makes it worse
My favorite one was when he's you guys know the unity episode, right? Um
Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this was this was great, right?
So in the unity episode the whole thing is that like
Summer and to a lesser extent morty want to like free the citizens of the planet that have been subsumed by the hive mind
Um, and when they do they find out that they're all a bunch of racists for a for a wolf and rags, right?
The context is this this creature
That is essentially like, you know
Like children of the corn like it takes over your body and makes you like clones you into a point where you you know
Longer have any free will corn. Yeah
I don't okay. Maybe you don't know what that is. It's like body snatches. Yeah
That's yeah, there you go borg. You know that right nebraska horror film fucking
So like it makes this you have no free will and you basically become a part of a collective. Okay, okay
So yeah, go on bring corn. Yeah
Yeah, so basically the collective
Um has taken over the planet
Summer and morty like kind of want to free them and when they do they find out that the people are actually a bunch of
Racists in a race war starts
um
And then and then like they get rescued
Um, and summer says something along the lines of I didn't realize freedom meant people doing things that sucked
And it's like that's a really that's a really funny word, right?
but like
Quinton's interpretation of that
What what was it that he what was quinton's interpretation was that that was the message of the episode that freedom is bad
Because it means that people do stuff that sucks
It's like the most retarded sifs level take ever
Yeah, i've saved the video and my whole thing is if I force rags to watch all of rick and morty
We will cover that video. It'll be great. I wouldn't mind watching rick and morty. I've heard good things about it
Well, that's the problem is the the fan base will convince people it's like oh, it's bullshit. It's like no, it's really not. It's good
It's a really good show and I mean dan harman seems to always be involved in really good shows. That's the thing
Yes, like I hear about the the the pickle rick thing. Yeah
That's a weaker episode. Yeah, it's not it's a good episode just the pickle shit is I don't like it
I like the therapy at the end ties it together really nicely. It's a good episode with a cool like
I think that our season three is a real mixed bag person and not rick mixed bag and that there are any bad episodes
Like they're all good. It's just that I always felt like
The season three finale left me confused like it being about the president, you know, you know, I mean you guys have seen it
Yeah, yeah
Finale, okay
I know that the premiere was really strong
The the wasteland episode. I wasn't a big fan of
I was gonna say we should probably go back to memes because rags
Have no fucking clue what we're talking about
The only reason you expect to be a big finale is because of season two in season one
The last episode of the season was just then having a party and that was it. That was a good finale
I thought it was quite explosive. Yeah, it was a good episode but like
The well, I guess the thing is it's it's has to do with like the tone of each season
It's something that the the writer seemed to be aware of season one was loose
You know fun classic rick and morty adventures as fast as morty said, you know fun classic, you know, rick and morty
And then seasons again rick and morty is some good shit. Honestly
Um, yeah, we should do that season four is amazing
um season four has been really so this is a reference to quiddin putting out a tweet saying that um,
If you you should ignore efap because they treat the people they disagree with as their personal nemesis
I don't even know who you are
Um, but yeah several people involved in that I suppose um now i'm just gonna start posting memes and we figure them out as we go
I um
Oh my god
So
That's from asdf movie
Yes, it is from asdf. Don't say asdf. That's gay. No, that's how tom pronounces
Yes, he's the creator. Why would he matter when it comes to it? Are you guys going to cite that?
We should call it gif instead of gif. I'm ready to respond theory. Jeff instead of gif
You guys gonna go there. Do you want to go there? Go there. What drives this? It's the paratext
That is metatextual of you to say oh, you should watch rena did cut to find out
Paratext so there's metatext paratext
Is context added by the author that's not in the actual text
Does it help you survive uh falling from a plane?
What what
Oh because wait paragliding oh
Para no parachute. Oh, wait. No paragliding applies, right? You can paraglide out of a plane
I guess you could jump from a movie plane and paragliding
That sounds like fun. Let's do that. It's just weird that you would think of that instead of parachutes
Yeah, I I like it's a paragliding before parachute
A thousand parakeets to my arms
I want to play the alien game with like a roster of eight people who are taking it very seriously just to see how it goes
Oh, that would be fun. I like the repurposed
I love this that is fortier's tismy drawing of like a barge simpson alien has like spread through all of the memes
Oh, that's wonderful
We got the she she crashes the ship on arc two she's got this stupid uchi dagger everything is proceeding
Excitement oh as if it was going to be good. So this is referencing how sargon came onto efap and it died
Um
Oh, so you guys know the meme the cartoon where it says like some guy's enjoying sports and then some guy goes
Hey sports are gay because blah blah and then he goes shush. Let people enjoy things
Look, we got the reverse shush. Let people engage in constructive criticism
Just let people enjoy stuff this is applicable because
We're currently we we stopped at six and a half hours. We're currently at three and a half hours. We're at nine ten hours nearly
With plenty to go
I can read that double the link
My favorite thing is like anyone who doesn't know what efap is reading this
Oh
The people wilted
How about you actually engage in conversation with me no, I don't think I will
Oh shit, this would be the uh
This is so we covered this actually for me star wars has actually been going downhill for years culminating with the unholy apocalypse
That is the last jedi
Tonald disproves of the last jedi
Uh, yeah fringy tonald
Actually made a good video. Yeah, and ironically he made a good video
Oh, wow
Like watch his new song woke star wars. There's a couple of hiccups, but overall it's actually a pretty strong video for the length
We think he may have been watching efap and he's just taking notes
Oh, that's you see what I mean? That's good. That's good. I seriously doubt that that's the case. But hey
I like to think about it that way
You never know people will you don't never know
We're gonna have to explain this so the fact that it's only half a head
So
Okay, fringy j. All right the first video from from from tonal we watched was his channel trailer for his second channel
He spends the first minute explaining that this is the channel. He will upload his low standard content
Which is pretty funny on its own
But we move on and the the video almost seems like it's gonna end
You know, you're like, oh, this is the natural end. He's like, no
He starts talking about how much he hates un no cooked carrots not uncooked. Yes
He's okay with raw carrot uncooked carrot. However, fuck him. No cooked cooked
Um, he's okay with raw carrot but not uncooked carrot. Yes. No, he's okay with
With raw carrot, but he doesn't have sticks. He does not like cooked
And he thinks it's like the bane of like the entire human race
He hates it and then he moves on to actually playing guitar and it's ironically cool
He's actually good at playing the guitar and we want more
You can see this covered in efap 64
watch it live
on
Clash attack. What's the new game? Raid shadow legends.com. Watch it there
The most ambitious RPG and the best part the best part it's free
Because they contracted too the poor fuckers can't say anything
Diabeto war star. Oh my god. Look at this cast of characters in this movie
How could you resist I I like that i'm uh, macho
Wait, who's rags he's who's that?
He's thor rags is the work and um, it looks like don is captain america. I'm disappointed that rags is not a woman
and um
What what are the other ones we got there? So
Oh, I guess one isn't relevant then he's just had his face blocked
By um, wait, you're right
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah, I can't see him. Um
Nobody's welcome falcons. That's a good conversation to have free. Do you think this is a good poster for a movie?
the original vision obviously, I mean
um, I
huh
What the you mean the the infinity war poster? Yeah
Um, my big problem with movie posters in general is that they seem to have an obsession with putting the actors faces on it
And when you have to do that, it means there's a lot of things you can't do
I think we talked about this off stream before but we really like the minimalist, you know attempt. Yes
Yes, definitely. I think if the poster was just like the gauntlet
Yeah, or some shit. You could have had just the gauntlet
You could have had maybe like iron man
Like you know like you could have him sort of flying forward with a street going behind it and then maybe like the silhouettes of a
Bunch of other superheroes like I don't need the face. That's the main thing. I know who the actors are
I guess if they sell better though is the thing
Well, uh, probably maybe I mean the one thing I will say
Is that this is like once in a lifetime sort of a cool factor of how many like this is seriously all star
And to have every just to be like whoa, that's how many people are in this movie
But it makes for a busy poster for sure
I guess the thing is though we look at like super smash brothers. They seem to handle
I mean, it's kind of a mixed bag with super smash brothers. I think like some of the
Covers are better than others
But um, hold on. Let me see the ultimate one super smash brothers ultimate
I don't know if it was like the most analogous. Yeah, like super smash brothers ultimate has like a fantastic poster. It's really really good
And um, I don't know maybe it has to do with the fact that it's all like painterly and it's not you know
It's not all like
It's clear that they weren't taking pictures of these actors on different days and then just compiling it together. You know what I mean?
They're not actors that they're not
Those aren't photos ringing your racist. Yeah, I literally just said that they were painterly fuck about bringing
Open your freaking ears
I think um, it's funny though. I think endgame's like poster is probably stronger when it comes to just composition
But I like infinity war more so like I don't know i'm conflicted
Like I said, it's once in a lifetime. It's like hey, look at all these characters from the marvel universe coming together
But also I love minimalist posters. So yeah, I remember I think we can all agree that there is no
poster than the spider-man homecoming poster
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't you mean far from home where they have that weird triangle thing going on?
Yeah, but like homecoming has this weird shitty looking like explosion fire thing on the screen. Oh, yeah, that poster isn't great
Like the one where there's like two spider-mans and two ironmans and just like a couple random smiling people there
You know the thing the thing is right like the teaser posters for both of those movies are way better
This is a jj abram skidded fortnite. Yeah, this this poster is way better. The um, there is a jj abram skin in fortnite
That is correct. That is crazy
It's a much much better poster
Look at that someone's someone's cropped this but the one the one where he's just lying down on a wall. I think it's great
Yeah, I like the uh far from home one where he's got a bunch of stickers on it from places
Fucking jj abram's that's sad
And fortnite is this this isn't a joke is this you can it's real
This is a direct problem that not necessarily started with but was just as cringy when they involved and not
Involved stupid fortnite in endgame. That was just as cringy
Stop it. Yeah, keep it out stupid
Money grab it tonaled was right. What did he say about fallen order that he shouldn't be so concerned with the bottom line
tonaled is lord
I can't believe we just referenced a tonaled video
in a positively positive light
He knows what's up tonaled is amazing
Oh my god, what is that?
What is this supposed to be there's a google images, I don't know the the iron man looks like that I was hacked alien
What do you why why why because his head is slightly bulbous
I don't know. He just reminds me of him. It just distills. What's wrong with the posters? Like oh, we got the washington
Oh, there's new york. I guess here's a whole bunch of people the one the rags just posted. That was cool
Yeah, I love that little poster, but like there should be things for him to hang off
No, yeah, we don't care
There's a lot of cool teaser posters for spider-man, but every time they do the theatrical ones like all right
Take the mask off put the bad guy on there put them all on there, you know, and it's like guys stuff it
You can get it. Oh my that that is busy. Well
That doesn't that doesn't look so cool I can't yeah like as much as I could appreciate the drawing of it
I can't fucking figure out what's happening. What are the circles at the bottom? Are they on discord?
Um
The actual illustrations are really good I just think the uh
It's too confusing someone someone put a lot of work into that like a deviant deviant art poster
Okay, I I don't like that one as much as what he told us the buildings look it makes sense because that's perspective idiot
That's a pretty good one. Actually. Oh, yeah, that was
Pretty good. That looks great. I like that. Yeah
Let me let me find the far from home post. Spider-man's in a bit of a weird pose. It looks like he's like
He's gonna drag that ass across the floor if he's okay this this should have been the actual poster for far from home
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I like that one. Yeah, really really good. I thought that was the poster for far from home
It was the teaser. It's the teaser poster. The actual poster is this one
Yeah, please post the real one it was fucking it's weird. It's the triangle one, right?
Yeah, oh god, that looks awesome. Yeah, it's weird
Why is there a triangle?
Mysterio does have triangles when he does his powery things. I think that's what's supposed to be right. Yeah, but like I don't know
Why is that
Hang on why is um, why is like mg there is like just why has she not got shading on hook?
Like they didn't have a brown leg. Oh, I don't know. I'll sell you man
It just looks like a 3d render that they put in there the other ones
Look 3d. She looks like the fill tool on a different lego piece
They just went out here's a better version it looks like oh my god, this is
Why we have not been getting through memes quickly this tree, I like how beams are delaying us by the way
I guess the issue with this one is it's too spoilery, but I don't know. I like Mysterio's design
I like the costume. How is that spoilery?
Because it kind of it makes him look evil. He's looming over him. I guess
The issue is
I like the poster a lot. Yeah, I guess the issue is um when it comes to Mysterio
It's like if you know the comics you're like, oh well
He's obviously a bad guy a lot of people argue that the the spoiler is already done because most people know but
I don't think most people well, that's the thing. I think I would argue most general audiences don't actually know
Well, I think it's going to be the guy in the fish helmet
Not well most people who know spider-man know but that's not many people in regards to the whole
That homecoming poster is is really great. Yeah, that's a really good one
I think it's too busy though with the webs and like the smudges all over it. It looks I'm not sure I agree
It's uh, I think it's I think it's really good
That one's he's not so super. He's not super imposed on the car too. Well, like no, he's not
Looks a bit oh god that foot. Yeah, that looks weird looking real flat footed there
But I still kind of like the poster I guess
That's a good poster. So this is this is top tier poster for spider-man
Honestly, right if they release that
So who wants to get back to memes
What yeah, these are the names
Oh, I think that's where we were we did that. Yeah, that was a weird tangent
We we got here from looking at posters. I'm sure this one won't lead us to talking about posters, too
Iron man homecoming blossom actor man and knuckles
I'm really disappointed that there's no you've gone
Somebody stop featuring dante from the devil
So
My god
Oh my god, they photoshopped
Robert dowdy juju's face
out of on the falcon
I'm trying to mean vulture
There's
Such a worthless
Vulture is unironically way better as a character
He is
I'm sorry. I'm so tired
I love that you started your stream
I went to bed and then I woke up and I was like, oh the stream's still going
Yeah, we restarted so we'd have enough time to read all the superchats. I'm starting to get concerned. We won't
Oh god, we haven't even gotten to them yet. Efap age of cap. She unmarvel. Did you see that?
I
Actually in like three hours I really will have oh
All right, uh, let's we're gonna crank this up folks we're gonna start moving faster so caption marble
We got all the players here. That's uh
Unfortunately age of ultron sucks. Oh, wait. What anyway next meme. Okay
I don't think anyone is in this room. I teach you who the rooftop god was. It's fucking wrong
Uh, I love that one gordon ramsey's gordon ramsey's great i'm he's fucking great
I watch his shows. He goes in the trophy case of humans. He totally does. Yes, he does. Uh, so this is alo saying that the
Looks like
Good meme
this is uh
Ea being this is a this is a tweet that came from the cyd nicolson picture. I believe it's the uh
relevant meme yeah
No, that was a this was a stratum ire, wasn't it? Well, it used to be I think this meme was inspired by stratum eyes one
Feeding him the can of uh, what was it just rights video on?
Cora, like it woke the ear the fuck up because
my goodness
Praising cora, that's evil. Um
This is the tree of discourse
What makes good rat you've got what's what's the 11 o'clock? What is that? What's that referencing?
Probably the 11 hour. No, that's 11 hours
Yeah, 11 hours. So we oh, I guess
I mean we go to 12 like 11 55 you call that 12 or 11, right assuming it's referencing the cap, I guess
I
I'm willing to agree with that dost thou lift look at wamen tlj is a stupid does objective even fucking jokers
How do they work milk the rhinos closed minded?
known leftist
Luke looks like a lesbian adaptation. It's the constant battle of true memory. Yeah
I quite like this favorite part of the known leftist thing is the known like known
Yeah, people are aware of it as opposed to an unknown leftist
What a fucking secret leftist all we have to do is exist and movie circle chick get fucking annoyed
Have they been taking snipes to dust recently? All right fringy tell me decipher this tell me what's happening
What the fuck?
Uh, so I guess the scribble at the top is like
Oh, i'm getting cold. So you're gonna have to hold on to that. Okay j j decipher this
Okay, so the isle of man flag is being destroyed. Mm-hmm. Unfortunately, right? I uh, I said
Did he really not
But he did knew himself but he unmuted to speak on the phone
Oh my god, yeah, i'm all right. I bought some fish
Australians what can I say?
Fish buyer. I wasn't all right, but I bought some fish and now I am yeah
So that's you know, I was you know, honey
I was I was really feeling down but I bought some fish and everything just turned around things are looking up
What kind of fish was it?
God, we can still hear it
Fringy tell us what fish it was
Um, you guys want to take bets on what kind of fish it was
Um
tilapia
I think it was a nice nice salmon. We've got to keep going on these memes j go
Okay, so you're like an amorphous cloud destroying the isle of man legs
I'm gonna go with that. Yeah, can you see like i've got a hand on the bottom left ish?
But it looks like it's disconnected from me like i'm ripping the leg off with my I think you're supposed to be like a
You're like rayman
A lot of the the images relation to the isle of man flag have me afraid of it or killing it and i'm like
Dude, I love the isle of man flag. Why would I kill it? Yeah
That shit is fantastic
Do you think it has three sets of genitals on those sets of genitals?
Well, you would have one set if it was two legs and then an extra leg means a half a set
So one and a half sets I suppose
Oh
That's my opinion
What uh, what what kind does it have? Well, that's my opinion. So
Does it have to be sunday guys? It's sunday
It's been sunday for like five and a half hours rex it has. Yeah. Yeah
for him
Oh, yeah for fring he's been sunday for ages
What's the international date line when how long has it been sunday internationally? I kind of would have like
I want to ask him about all the things he's been talking about when he comes back
I want to ask him why the fuck he unmuted like why would he do that?
All right, we have to we knew it would give us names the islay of man
maula versus jenny the massive
The entire world gripped by terror
Oh, that's cool. Hmm
Is this this is gojira, right?
I'm gojira. We've got kingador in the background. I think jenny is
um
I don't know my gojira enough to know what they did guys
what
He did he did what?
Free he did he did it. Yeah. All right. He did free. He did it. Yeah
This this meme works with context and without it
He's such a good character though
This is also a
This is also something that we've got a fish. Was it for me? What what kind of fish was it? Yeah, it was goth fish
Goth it was goth. You know, like a real fish. What was it?
No, what was the fuck is goth fish?
What is that is it's like why was it why was it so important that it was sunday?
Huh
Why is someone talking to you about fish on sunday?
I'm not unmuted, but I didn't so now it's fish. What did you do for me? You said I did it
What did you do? Well done. You did it. I applaud you. Yeah, i'm not providing the context of this discussion
That means it's shady but I didn't press mute so yeah, awesome. I thought you muted and unmuted was
How that must have been what happened then because that was an accident
You let us in on your entire conversation so we did I know I mean, what do you mean when you did it I mean
I I had goth fish. That's what i'm telling you
But why was it on a sunday? What do you mean on a sunday? You don't even understand what that's
I know we only heard your side of the conversation. So we now need the context. I don't want to give it to you
Well, you said oh, it's it's it's it's shady or this is very very suspicious
Frank here, are we not your best friends?
Your only friends
No, he's got his garfish dealer
Yeah, exactly explain how garfield became a fish
Okay. Well, here's the context
So I got some garfish and I was talking about how great it was that my garfish dealer was available on a sunday
To give it to me because he's not normally where you have an actual
Scarfish slang for something. Is that is that the big is that the big crack? Is that what that is?
It's garfish slang for coke. I just assumed that you guys knew what garfish is or maybe it's just oh my god
It's it's a fucking it's a curvy face
Holy shit, well, we don't even look at this. Look at this. It's a sea fish in your waters
Yeah, I know what it is. Look at that. It's it's like what am I facing a fish that broke its back?
Why does this fish exist fringy even if they're in our waters i'm not sure that we eat them
Oh
Holy shit, they're long
Oh my god, are they a longman fish?
They have the longman fish. Yes, i've i've never heard of garfish because when you say that over here
We have alligator gar and stuff like that like fucking fish that are angry with lots of teeth and stuff
Oh, it seems like they vary quite dramatically in size
So we've got that big one that has put in we've also got this one
Apparently remarkable republicans in the chat who wants to debate us
Went we're debating garfish wait, you fucking dude
The freaking garfish real or fake it's real
Then it got australia as a night out conference
That's just what a fucking liar would say you ate the garfish and didn't I didn't like
Huh? What are you talking about? Why didn't you share your garfish with us? You always share your fish
I just like put it in my computer
Important question. Yeah, it looks like it slips right through the ethernet cable. Great important question. Okay ready?
Do you think it was a good joke that they commented on the inaccuracy of the stormtroopers in mandalori in episode six?
Um, what are you? Oh, yeah, that's kind of funny rags assault him
Uh, no, I don't want it to be like an in universe thing that stormtroopers are incompetent and can't aim
All right, that's a good point. Actually, all right. I'll walk it back
Wow, well, all right then back to garfish
Back to garfish what said to talk about
Uh, because we have uh, let me show you um, we don't believe garfish exist
I think that's an australian conspiracy. Well, it's part of the australian conspiracy
They've they've well-built it like, you know loads of the uh, loads of the wildlife. It's willed built
Idiot world builders god you so well builded it
Because okay, so they're similar but this is what we've got we got these uh, these here alligator
Gar's
No, that wasn't the fucking team
Fuck you up. What the fuck is that? That's a that's an alligator gar. That's not an alligator. That's a that's a fish
Okay, look i'm gonna post it again. You guys are not appreciating the power of this meme
Would you not would you would you not sit on his lap would you not sit on his lap?
absolutely
Wow, that's a hell of a photoshop job. Yeah
Well, i'm starting to wonder if he's ever great. Is there a picture of him?
I can't believe i'm looking this up. This is on my computer. Jeb bush santa
So i want to remind you regs that we said if we replace gandalf with hitler, I think it would make for a very
Lord of the rings mine towers
Oh god
Um, what else we got?
I think it's just a picture but I think this already existed without it being a meme
That makes sense
It's wags I don't feel so good
It's weird like wags
Sargon has this beam that he destroys things he comes out of that he fucking like efap
That's the only efap we've actually had to stop during right? I don't think we've ever had that before
Yeah, I don't think it's ever happened. It's a weird man. No, no, no, no the um
The meme one we had to stop sharing. No, no, we didn't we just had to stop covering that video. We carried on
Oh
Yeah, even then
He's got long sword long fish long bow long man. These are
All from the same long fish like a like a gar fish
Oh my god
I don't know. What is this help me?
What is what is it I said it isn't impossible to believe the earth is a marshmallow
When did you when was that when did that come up and why?
Oh, it was the nature of belief. Yeah. Oh
Yeah, yeah, that was the um the all-o episode
When cookie when cookie wants to commit to genocide, I can't believe none of you remembered that look
What am I supposed to remember everything?
Yes, that's racist. It's a job. You think because i'm white that I remember everything
But I didn't say it like that. You said it like that
That's true
This is a good meme, so why is skywalkers pg-13 and yet it's meant for children
but
You know everyone what is the definition of children in terms of age group?
Is it from like as much as like five to seventeen or something?
So hang on. Are you saying that someone under five isn't a child? What are they a baby?
A four year a four year old is not a baby. They can be you kidding me?
Oh like my my two sisters five-year-olds are often still referred to as babies by my family
Um, so it says that a child is a human being between the stages of birth and puberty. Oh
Hang on a minute i'm wrong by that definition sure
but uh
The definition that's that's some tism because fucking i'm just talking about how it's colloquially used in my culture
So get fucked colloquially. Yeah, I didn't I didn't say I was going by the dictionary. So get fucked greenman
Okay, but now now we are going by the dictionary. Oh
Is that right? Well, I guess if we're going by the dictionary then i'll have to ask you what the definition is, wouldn't I?
Because I don't go by the dictionary
24 7 why did you go before with your definitions like oh because I was going colloquially
Which is what everyone does before checking the dictionary used anecdotal evidence. Yes
That means you lose the debate. That's that is racist
Well, I mean, I don't know that's biased against mode
The point is that patrick ohms thinks it's children and he is absolutely correct because yes
No adult ever enjoyed star wars. All right, so get fucked
See I do like the whole thing of star wars is meant for children and like people get their arms cut off routinely
Just common in jeff we try please class
I like how the coin vision of him still looks like depressed. He's like
Fuck it. I guess i'm president. Whatever. Please. Can someone manufacture this?
Wait, hang on isn't manufacturing currency illegal like
Um, I mean that's not legal tender. Well if it were if you were trying to pass it off as such
Sure, but we're not done it. We're just gonna have
Well, i'm just letting you guys know you shouldn't try to purchase any kind of thing with this. Okay, keep it to yourselves
Okay, I mean it's a jeff token. Oh my god. Can you imagine actually giving this to a vendor and they look at it?
They just say like I voted for him too, isn't it um
I I would assume it's legal to try and pay with stuff that isn't money
It's just you know, the shop is obviously gonna reject it. Is it? No, I don't think it is
Well, what if you bought uh, what if you bought like, um, you know an older, you know
Like how people collect antique coins. What if you decided to use that antique coin?
It's a cop's gonna beat you up. No, it's still it's still legal
No, like coins don't expire if you're using another do they do they do when they're um, okay
So in britain, we used to use shillings
Those you can't use those anymore
Yeah, you actually had I think it was
Well, it was like 20 pounds to the shilling and 12 shillings to the pound or some shit
It was yeah, he's calling you an old man fight him back. Fuck him up
I'm not an old man. I know this because I watched doctor here. Well, they're not that makes you an old man
You can't know the difference between expiration and being able to use it as like actual legal tender
You're pretty much always able to swap it out
I doubt that you'd be able to swap out some shillings
They went out like 50 years ago, I think
No, normally whenever they're moving from one to another yeah, you can stop it out for a while, but you can't anymore like I guess
Uh, I don't know because um in australia
We used to use the australian pound and that got out of circulation length in the 70s
So i'm not sure that if I tried to pay for something with an australian pound that i'd get beat up and arrested
Wait, why did she get beat up? Why was that the thing?
Well, because the whole thing was is it illegal to use? Um, you know
Fucking australian police roughen you up. That's fucked up, dude
No, well, I I initially used it as american police, but then I just translated over here for our money
What that actually do is say come on mate. Come on, you know, just use your head
How did you just fail to do an australian accent with that impression? Like looks like
Literally can't fail because he's from australia. That doesn't make sense. That's my point. Give it a go
What do you mean that's your point? You just said he failed he can't
I can't fail. What's my accent? That's the same as people say like molds have a welsh accent. It's like from wales
The fact that you're from somewhere doesn't mean that you have that place's accent well that's no the yeah sure but I have it though
Yeah, no, I agree. I agree with that
The implication is that it's a fake and it's like well if i'm born and bred in wales and I have this accent
Then this accent is welsh by definition, but it could still be not what's understood typically as a welsh accent
Yeah, but that's your fault
Where are you from jay? I'm from lester. You're from lester. That's why I said that
No, you we just established that you don't have to sound like a place that you're
Lester sure. Yeah, that's why that's my point. I was saying well, I don't sound like I don't have an accent from the place
I'm from yeah, I don't sound like I'm from wheels either do I?
Exactly, that's what I said
Yeah, no, this is the welsh accent I don't give a shit if you think it's like jamaican me
That's fucking stupid like you know
Like just because it's not like movies and stuff doesn't mean you don't know what it sounds like like fucking dr
Do little over there is going to be happening
It's fucking stupid
Oh my god, that's your real voice
And you're letting it out
But are you like guy are you fuck is like not aware of how the welsh accent sounds like like?
No, i've seen touchwood. Who is this part of you? I've never been this is literally the welsh accent you fucking idiots
Like I feel like you're an adequate yet sloppy lover
Adequately need to test this out. I don't I don't mind because it's an adequate
No problem getting fucked but it would just be really messy, you know
No, like fucking adequate. I'm all right. Well, i'll settle with that
Because of the accent like
One of the one of the big reasons why I wanted to separate myself from the tizzleby welsh language was when I was in high school
one of um
Someone like annoyed someone else and he outraged with this scenario said oh, why did you do that for?
And I was like, yeah, welsh accent fucking balls. So is the so is the words they use
They sound like cavemen
Why did you do that for?
So what
Child is lost
The welsh accent is just not um in media enough for people to know what it sounds like
It's tisney though. I don't this is the thing. I don't use that accent
Um, but I never really had a strong welsh accent
But the thing is people listening to my videos could tell I had a welsh accent because the way that I pronounce certain words
But here like are there any certain words that are like a yeah
I remember earth milk
That was a thing just because I don't say earth milk all the all the milk that I drink is earth milk
Yeah, sea rags is on my team
Yeah, I love her. I I like hellman milk ew
martian milk
I was hacked molar is confirmed jamaica welshman
That's something build a bear but welsh people
Make a welshman
That sounds like a drink you'd order at a bar is like hey, can I get a jamaica?
Well, and ironically, right?
So robert down his junior is going to be in the doctor do a little film
He's supposed to be doing a welsh accent
But he's like whispering throughout the whole thing and he's sort of doing it
But uh all the comments section like what the fuck is this accent? All welsh people are like, uh, that's kind of our accent
Um, i'm gonna jump the line with the memes. I just got sent this
Can we can we officially can we officially officially
Officially officialed I mean I would have gone with dark fringy, but jesus
I mean i'm not going with that. Here's another dark fish meme
I've got loads of like fucking iron man posters or whatever to get rid of too
Oh my god, we're not even close my favorite
They did that with the bucket tool instead of by like adjusting the hero saturation. Yeah
It's just like the worst possible way of doing it
It's it but it looks it makes it look so much better as a meme
All right, where were we
No, yes
Yes. Oh my god, someone just drew an amazing picture in efap podcast talk
Send it over
Oh, i'm fucking doing it
Uh, like I click it
Feel free to converse as I do this
I still I still can't access
All right one new meme. Okay before rag submits his meme. We'll have one new meme for us. Where are we?
Jeb coin. Oh, right. I posted this one. Okay, so this is legitimate comments about uh, my slash efaps work
It's got some guy who made the six hour takedown on last jedi when your anger response is longer than the thing itself
You can't be a very skilled direct right to reddit. That's from
Houston productions next one is mola fakes a british accent to make himself sound more intelligent. I believe that's remarkable
What is a british accent?
There's a shit ton of british accents
He's in fat who can confirm that this is your retarded take
When anyone says british accent what they're referring to is thick glaswegian glaswegian
Next up is therefore his way of viewing media
His conservative christian way will be the only real way of viewing it. There's someone on twitter recently
Oh, yeah, someone said you're a conservative christian. Yeah, they said we are
Conservative christian podcast you didn't jay
You didn't see that the person who said that we're we we view media in a conservative christian, uh lens
I can see how they get that from I can't
No, of course. I was fucking retarded. Okay. Good. That was that was sarcasm
He's somewhere right of center and is using movie critique to push right wing propaganda
Wait, but
Remarkable republican you're in chat i'm left wing right i'm not right wing, right
We're all left wing aren't we? No, no, no all of us are right wing because he doesn't like oh, no
No, wait, sorry. What was the left wing from his perspective?
He says we're left so him and knobs think we're left wing, but the rest of the planet thinks we're right wing
The rest of it here's how it works. Um
Right and left don't work. Uh don't exist as like, um
Objective concepts anymore. It's now entirely subjective if someone's more left than you
They're a leftist if someone's more right than you they're a nazi
Everyone blamed sargon for the disruption of the meme. Oh my god. Oh my god
That's is that nicos who did that I believe it is
The pink nicos on twitter. I believe that is the the drawing style remarkable republican asks. Who is wolf?
Is
Hey wolf, do you know where remarkable republican is
I've known who apart. Oh
Quite a while
Wait a minute. Is that is that the hold on?
That is the guy who wanted to make a colony on mars. Yes
We need to go to mars and make it all white
Yeah and privatize the military if he joins the discord. I could theoretically get him in here just for cameo
Yes, okay
Alright remarkable republican if you're listening go to the description find the discord invite join it and then at uh, no
You don't even need to add me just add me as a friend
In the top right of the options if you don't have discord then you're fucked
Everyone just go download it. It'll take like five minutes
All right. Oh this one. This one's interesting. We'll we'll have everyone have their opinions. All right
We'll start we'll go from top left to bottom right sort of
So do you agree that on the scale of smart sincere stupid disingenuous tonaled is the smartest and sincerest of all the people we've covered
Yes. Yes, I would definitely
Especially after tonight's episode. Yes, then we've got um
Uh, well, I guess on the opposite end. We've got movie bob. Do you think that's fair?
Yeah, no, no, I don't I think I think he believed he was genuine
I think he's sincerely stupid. Yeah. Yeah. No, I I don't think he's disingenuous. He's actually a psycho
Most of these people think are genuine
Yeah, I think uh, no bullshit is disingenuous and stupid is no bullshit on this selection. Yeah, I think no bullshit is disingenuous
Yeah, I think he's right next to clinton
He's yeah, he's got to be both
It's really
It's really tough to tell whether he's disingenuous or he's just actually
Really, I think his old channel makes me think he's disingenuous like as in yes, he'll do whatever he has to to get
Do whatever he can to get issued fame and money. What the fuck? All right. Yeah, bison wolf vr nintendo switch game
Oh wolf, did you see that there's someone who's there's a guy making a halo reach vr?

Are you trying to tell me that remarkable republican isn't an intelligently intelligent person
No
I'm not trying to say that I would never say that
Jay, what do you think about this image?

Hey remarkable republican, what are you called on discords just to clarify so I don't add a rando
Look at a rando at a rando. Just let's see what happens
Random person random person. I want to get a random person in claiming to be remarkable republican to see what they say
This actually happened
He's muted he's muted this ruins the bring out the wild soup
I'm just going to post means until he unmutes post means
Better this is the internet
You're not allowed to be a youtuber on twitter. I'm blowing you mola. Oh my god. Hello
So, can you hear me fine? Everything's good most yes, how do you do?
Doing all right, man. How are you?
Excellent. I've had many to drink and i'm with i'm jovial with friends. How do you do?
I wish I had had more to drink, but I had
So
What was what did you want to talk about?
Oh, you know, whatever you guys want to talk about
I didn't realize this was a special stream until I got into it because I didn't see like the first few hours. So
Um
You say that you wanted to debate something?
Yeah, I just wanted to you know debate a little star wars or game of thrones or something of that nature
That's cool with you guys. Are you sure that the the layer is best friend hot rather than just super hot?
I'm 100 positive about that. Yes. What about when she's wearing the bikini?
Oh, that that's not too bad, but um still best friend. She should have done that in the other two movies also. I mean
Sure, I wouldn't have said no to it. Yeah, that's what i'm saying, right? I mean, you know, we're gonna do a
Personally, I think all of the characters should have
Do you still feel that vader is a rip-off of robocop? Oh, no, I'll look that one up. I guess
Sorry if you okay if you were
At a spaceship and landed on mars and you wanted to go outside. What would you wear?
And you could wear a space suit, I guess right?
I mean, yeah, that would be my choice
What an odd question jay. Why would you ask him that yeah jay?
Like wellies, what did you think welly?
Hey only wellies
What was wellies well wellies are like big old rubber booties to prevent the mud from getting to your socks
Oh, I mean, yeah, as long as it's somewhat pressurized you'd be all right
I don't think wellies are pressurized. Hey, okay
Just because you say that doesn't mean it's true jay. Not the cheap jetty lens, but the expensive wellies
The space wellies
I'm imagining someone of us wearing wellies but nothing else
I imagine c3po where well can okay honest question can gay people wear wellies?
I don't know what wellies are so think harder
They are like big rubber boots
Without laces or anything. They just let you slip them on
Walking in mud the kind of rain boots that girls wear. Oh, yeah, those those they're very popular in the uk
Sure, I guess I mean
Let me let me look through some of your stories anything. You can buy in a store you can wear
Um including macaroni
What do you make the whole shirt out of it? Do you have only if you only have one foot are you wearing wellies?
Are you wearing welly?
You're just wearing well
Do you think it was?
Sounds careful
Do you think it was a smart decision to put the catapults of the front of the army in game of thrones?
I mean the treasury shays. Sorry
Yeah, I do
Why reason is they assume that the armies of the night would arrive by day?
So it would give you the maximum time and space to fire at them from afar
But that's not the maximum time and space they're in the front of the army
Yeah, but if you're there behind the castle walls, they don't have a clear line of sight. That's the
If they're behind the walls more trebucides don't need a line of sight
Yeah, that's like the advantages that they don't need a lot. Are you fucking retarded? Do you not know how to be?
Because he doesn't know how trebuchet
If you fire, I mean I've looked up stuff
I mean i've learned a lot of stuff about military things since I did my privatization series, but when when you're firing
Okay, look there's a lot of velocity so the range you'll have when you're firing and
You realize having the behind the castle walls gives them more range than having them in front closer to the enemy army
The big thing is right no matter how much range you gain from putting them at the front you have zero range
Once the dead close, uh, they're not going to be useful anyway unless you will in the killer
Why would the zombies arrive by day?
Why would they why would they not there's I mean if you think about it because their whole thing is night
Attention their bosses called the night king. I'm aware of this
Also existed during the day. I mean we see pictures of them today. I mean it's not like all you're right
Oh, if their strategy is to rush the castle with melee weapons
Wouldn't it be advantageous to use the cover of night? Nobody said they exist during the day, too
Not really, I mean, you know, they could fight during night or day. They had a massive advantage
I mean, I guess but they were you're saying you're saying you're saying that they actually that their strategy worked because it was at night
That helped a lot. I mean because
So why would they go in the day sense that they would do it at night then?
Like it makes perfect sense. I mean, yeah, if they if they can plan it that precisely but I mean
Out of the 24 hour period
I
Think one of you guys criticized the fact that they had to don't rocky charge, but I mean that's how
Buddy you don't know anything about military tactics. You don't use light cavalry to start a frontal assault
They literally had no back up
They would say
Mr. RR you you realize they all died
You
Do you have some true
They all get it by immediately because they did next episode and there was a lot of dark rocky around the
The editing or you're
We actually don't know if some of them were able to deliver them right off.
How could they have possibly lived though?
Like surely they would have come back, you know, the same way that their zombies did
but they didn't.
It's just nothing but zombies.
So they're all dead.
How many Dothraki zombies did you see?
Dude, they're all dead.
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Did you miss the part where the Night King raised the dead?
Did they all put back up?
But where were the Dothraki zombies?
They just wrote down.
They were in the crowd.
They were attacking Daenerys and all those guys.
You try to argue to us that the fact that they were dead rather than zombies is a win.
I think you guys are overestimating the number of Dothraki here.
I think you're overestimating the amount of functioning brain cells in your entire head.
Don't come down, wolf.
I mean, how many cavalry charges have you led lately?
How many have you led?
So we're on even footing, so we're not going to freak it out.
Say anything about cavalry charges because we haven't been in them.
Is that how it works?
I haven't drank battery acid, but I haven't.
They rely heavily on momentum and space.
That's why you have the force.
What good is that going to do if you're basically running into a brick wall of dead people?
It's just a wall of zombies.
You're going to die.
They have short swords.
You can't do shit.
Plus, you can't do shit.
They have short swords.
It's pitch black.
They don't even see them until they're like a meter ahead of them, and then they're all
dead.
It was a stupid idea.
You can see how the short swords are going to end.
The better course of action definitely would not have been sending your cavalry in as the
front, like the full frontal assault to die instantly and be used against you.
No, I mean, that's clearly the move to make because cavalry just aren't that useful on
the defensive that you have to attack somewhere.
They don't even use them at all.
They just put them with all the other dudes.
They didn't wait until the zombies were against the wall, and then they flank from the sides
of the castle.
Basically, this would be like if you had people swimming across the English Channel to an
attack.
I mean, I think you're underestimating how tough the Dothraki are in an attack, but also
they can't defend.
They all die!
They all die!
They all die!
They all die!
How many dead do they take with them?
We don't know.
It wouldn't matter because they become zombies anyway.
It doesn't happen until much later in the battle.
You have no idea if the Night King or any of his subjects raised the dead between that
moment and later.
You have no idea!
And we know for sure it happened at least once.
Your entire argument rests on the idea that the White Walkers decided not to raise the
dead at that point.
You're right.
You know what?
You're right.
They had millions anyway.
Why even pop?
Because if you can do that at any point, your casualties are irrelevant.
You can give the other side a false sense of hope, then raise the dead and be like,
gotcha.
A false sense of hope?
The zombies!
Yeah, they're looking really hopeful throughout that.
Why would the zombies want to give them a false sense of hope?
Let's give them a false sense of hope by giving them loads of free treats and killing loads
of our guys.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
We're giving them loads of free treats and killing loads of our guys.
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.
Can you have a bunch of treats still?
Yeah.
Have a bunch of dudes surrounded and you're just like, here, use this guard.
Go on.
I'll give you a sporting chance to kill us.
Go on, do it.
It's like ...
The ultimate, the ultimate ford-y test tactic is just killing your own troops.
To own the zombies.
To own the zombies.
your own troops to own this if you didn't think the devil get back up I mean it
makes sense they know how this works do they all know that they saw it at hard
home I haven't even seen the show and I know that witness them raise the dead at
hard home he would have told everybody by the way they could raise the dead to
fight in their army but did he know they could they could do it at en masse
though I mean he watched it the wildling army which is supposed to be one of the
largest armies in Westeros into zombies remember that happening I'm gonna go get
some more pizza you're telling me that you don't remember the one good thing
from all of season five no I guess not I guess that was what do you remember like
do you remember like what happened six seconds ago have you ever engaged your
brain in your entire life wolf be nice like when I destroyed you just now on
this point about Game of Thrones and also like the whole King's Landing
battle I mean that one actually I think you guys
battle she fucking wiped out every there was no battle it was over she took out
all the crossbows like just like that night was over she made the militarily
wise decision to go to create a path for her troops to continue to advance
she burned the city to the ground her troops didn't mean they literally retreat
because the city is falling apart have to run away from their own leader when
you're sacking a city people can not up in the streets especially narrow streets
like King's Landing and at that point then her already depleted forces from
the previous battle could take additional casualties so if you clear
by blaming concentrations it helps I need shadow it wasn't concentrated it
was the whole thing it was the whole city she killed everyone she killed
people who were well out of the way of the battle I mean I don't think it's
sure that many civilian deaths I think people were reacting
they just happened to be in the way she even admits that she killed children in
the next episode she had to clear the street of screaming no women and children would get
in the way of the invading I'm sure John was very thankful that those children are out
of the city and understand how the sack of a city work I mean you should be saying right
there you know how when Germany invaded Paris they didn't just kill every single person that
was in the city you know that right they're mistake right all the troops lay down their
arms though they were still resisting they literally threw down their weapons there that
was in there I saw that scene they literally threw down their weapons it then picked them
back up because they were being melted by horrible fuck well did the Daenerys hear from
Cersei that she surrendered to Cersei wave a flag on the town the bells I thought the
whole point of the belt is I have direct access to the bells how was she done to send a message
city surrendered she surrendered what what's she gonna do she's got her Kingsguard she
has to get a mobile phone call from okay so she's got a Kingsguard so let's burn all of
the children it's not what I said but like the big that's the thing that's the action
that she took that you were defending currently know when she burned the city I don't know
if Daenerys heard the bells John heard them and we know that from the scene but she literally
people argue the bells sent her insane that's what people actually argue I don't know how
Bill would send somebody insane I agree with you I don't know how Bell said someone insane
unless it's the first time in her life she's heard a bill which I'd never heard it hang on
that's that's I really want to question that why would that send you insane if you'd never heard
about before like oh my god what's that I'm just not speculating oh my god what's that I gotta
get somebody would think that but I don't know well no we're just up there top 10
what a what a season finale this is I'm gonna get another beer this is like the end of phase one
one who knows what phase right at this point
um why did you spell in your video a game of thrones season eight story ox like
oc as in you know like Noah's ark how you spell the word ark you spelt it arks
but you're talking about you're talking about story arcs though right correct yeah a story
arc is not spelt with a k it's spelt with a c
sure it doesn't sound right it's hold on fringy I love you man
I mean I don't know what to tell you man like according to wikipedia that's how it's spelt
I don't know
uh all right well I mean you got anything to say to me
gotta oh I mean whatever oh god no oh god no okay I think we'll all just be able to mute and
shad you're taking the freight I need this please shad pick up the phone
who is shad he's kind of an idiot he thinks he knows shit about medieval stuff I was I was
going to see if he could talk we like we like to humor him yeah well here's a thing here's
the thing they're all lying he's your worst fucking nightmare and I'm gonna love the next
five minutes why would you say that when he hasn't answered the call yet worst nightmare pick up the
phone oh no hold on he just wants to drag out the suspense
I will agree that I see the link you sent me okay who are you who are you voting for in the
20s of the work do what uh no you're wrong man sorry like it's spelt off with a c
like don't you saw yeah you sent me the link I saw it I didn't know there was another version
of the word I thought it was just you mean like the covenant for us everyone's got yeah
yeah everyone's got knowledge caps that's fine yes fine it's fine right survival evolved
uh why why is the outer world's cultural Marxism
the game clearly promotes anti-capitalism and it does so pretty unapologetically how so I haven't
played it I mean okay so you start out you're in this world where there is a board of corporations
running everything and it's basically just all humor about how these companies are evil and how
their products suck and how all the people who lead these companies are corrupt and incompetent
why is that anti-capitalist by its very nature though that's literally the only kind of joke
this in the entire thing so that can be anti-corruption I I doubt that that's the only
joke in the game being being against corruption and capitalism against being against capitalism
it literally is okay it's a straw man argument against capitalism
it literally is no one interpreted the one who said it was an argument
well I'm just viewing myself because I can't control myself
you and mine are hanging there I'm doing it so you can do it none of you guys have played outer
worlds no no I don't I feel like I don't need to to know that you're not telling me
so I mean I'm pretty sure you would agree with me if you play the game we put it that way I feel
that the only jokes in the game are anti-capitalist much I mean I'm sure you have an occasional sex
joke but I mean I played about five hours of it and it was just oh so you didn't beat it
it the game pissed me off it pissed you off why is that the game pissed you off the way you didn't
finish it what how did it piss you off the story was just I mean the story was just shitting all
over capitalism I mean I don't want to sit there and listen to that okay well let's let's let's
let's actually dive deeper if the story was shitting exclusively on capitalism why is that
necessarily a bad story because it's a false story I mean what do you mean a false story
what if that's what stories are real capital what is meritocracy by it's very is it no no you can
have no because you've got um I love capitalism but there's definitely nepotism and capitalism
yeah yeah like especially I love capitalism holy shit there's a lot that goes on capitalism favors
those who are already rich but well no that's just money that's just money favors those who
were always rich yeah that's what I that's why that's what I mean like there's money in this way
okay in the game Outer Worlds I think they go through seven or eight companies eventually
from what I've read in reviews would every company be led by someone who is completely and totally
retarded I met the guy in the first village who was running the cannery and I mean this guy
was completely moronic he was unable to run his business he he had let a bunch of people walk out
of the camp he couldn't do anything about them he couldn't make people work he couldn't well what
do you how does how does somebody make people work if they don't want to I mean if you're the boss
you figure out how to do that whether it's through persuasion force what have you got to do
I mean it's game yeah in this game they own their employees I mean if you you know you
get something that's not capitalism yeah I'm pretty sure that is capitalism no you don't own
your workers no but that is still that's still by definition capitalism it's just not the capitalism
capitalist system that we use being unable to negotiate your uh own working conditions
they did as far as capitalists they signed contracts when they moved to this solar system
okay so it's indentured servitude right you could call it indentured servitude but I mean it's
a fair price for being transported is it a fair price I don't know I'm gonna have a person ship
I don't think that's fair are there like how else do you pay for that kind of interstellar travel
money with money with money how are you not having enough money unless you have a job
yeah you got a job you do that by being rich yeah do it without money wow that's an interesting
commentary on capitalism oh wow whoops I mean the last I checked uh space travel was not exactly
listed as a necessity was it uh but I thought we needed to go to Mars to set up an ethno state
an ethno state would be barbaric and backwards this is the only the only groups that have enough
resources to colonize and then the morality to keep a community like that together under harsh
conditions probably would be a church organization like mostly only groups with enough money would
be a church like Scientology they'd probably fuck it up but they you know they're welcome to try
everyone would direct them to the light see you know lead us back to the home planet
there are also a lot of benefits of a space colony that would I don't think you're considering like
especially say for old people who know we don't disagree with the space pot we like the space
colony space colonies are a big thumbs up for me and for me I like space space is fun I want me
some space it's the final frontier at astra movie review I haven't seen it what what do you like at
astra did you like that oh wait wait wait wait okay okay so sorry I gotta I'm the host I gotta
redirect this conversation now myself j fringy rags wolf if we could all stay silent and allow
these two gentlemen to to talk about shad do you remember episode three of game of thrones season
eight yes the castle defense from the army of zombies do you remember this oh oh yeah that one
absolutely I do remember this um I would like remarkable republican how do you what do you
think of the defense of the castle I'll let you start and then I will be silent I think that the
defense that danny and john mounted was fundamentally sound based on medieval realism
they deployed the catapults forward so they'd have the maximum distance to fire at the approaching
enemy they were shipping the enemy would arrive by day they sent the cavalry to charge because
the cavalry needed space and momentum to be effective so their opening moves were solid
they also divided their defenders between outside the castle walls and inside so we're defending all
parts at all times I don't see how they could have done much better than what they did they
also had their dragons doing close air support and looking out for the other dragon so I feel
like they mounted a pretty competent and respectful defense do you know what castles are meant to be
yeah they're also cavalry when when is when is it preferable to use cavalry in um open warfare
three percent of the time no
uh battle of ashen core massive french cavalry charge got absolutely wiped out by uh english
archers there are many situations no there are many situations when cavalry is a terrible idea
and the situation when they were used in game of thrones is most definitely one of them
well the the dead didn't have archers though so it's not ashen core
no no no but see the other situation cavalry primarily is used for shock tactics hopefully
to try and break up a unit formation and you want to get them to flee if they don't flee
and they storm the cavalry the cavalry will be dead and so after the first impact if the
infantry isn't breaking up the cavalry needs to retreat otherwise they're going to get mowed down
now with an army of the dead do they retreat that i'm aware of no the the army of the dead don't
retreat um and they were also outnumbered as well the other time when you can use cavalry to just
really mow down infantry is if you are outnumbering them in a large measure you have a lot more
cavalry but even that that's even then that's not a a guaranteed thing uh it always needs to be used
with the right you know reason and consideration and stuff like that but in regards to the game
of thrones situation the cavalry was outnumbered and the undead weren't retreat and so sending
them in is utter and complete suicide especially looking at it from the historical lens of what
cavalry is meant to do and when they're meant to be employed and shad are there different kinds
of cavalry oh yeah light cavalry heavy cavalry and stuff like that and what's interesting about
the game of thrones thing technically the dothraki are light cavalry um and so that is like to use
light cavalry in a heavy frontal assault charge into infantry like that is absolutely just
completely retarded because they're they're not unarmored so sorry they're not wearing heavy armor
to survive the melee that they're running into they don't have lances so there's no insta kill
on the direct hit impact they are they are armed with like small sickles and stuff like that which
means they can't strike anyone in front of their horse okay you can only strike people with these
type of weapons on the sides of your horse which means you can't remove or attack anyone in front
of you and so you're just presenting your horse to be killed in that way you might be underestimating
the skill of these guys who have been kicking so much ass in the show so so they're superhumans
and they they were dominating an isos probably because they were being used in the right way
as light cavalry should be skirmishing harrying around the edges and stuff like that there was
also a lot of mounted archers with the dothraki if i recall um and again just like the mongolians
historically uh light cavalry you run around it and like if you look at history um there were
actually some interesting engagements between the mongolians and uh eastern europeans you can
kind of call them knights but not like that anyway armored you know european very medieval kind of
combatants and they got absolutely mowed down by the mongolians because mongolians were employing
their light cavalry to just perfect you know just in a perfect amount and it was basically
running around them pinging them from a distance not running into heavily armored units i mean the
only the only weakness of the mongols historically is if they'd ever run across real european knights
i mean there's no way in hell they could have gone up toe to toe with like richard the lion hard
or like the mongolians trashed um the europeans when they like we're talking about mounted you
know um uh units whenever they engaged they won like like if you're looking at the from
the medieval technological standpoint also have you ever seen a uh have you ever seen a picture
of the mongolian empire and how far west yeah that's when it's a russia they were they were past
russia they were almost constantinople i mean they were they were pretty far west
and they didn't conquer anywhere where they had true knights
no you would call them true well hang on how do you define true knights so you're talking about
uh heavily armored cavalry because the mongolians did defeat the mongolians did defeat heavily
armored cavalry plant sword and no no no no the mongolians did defeat heavily armored cavalry
it's historical it's it happened were they knights what how do you define knights um you
have to have the equipment and you also have to have a coat of chivalry how do you define
the coat of chivalry it's the coat of chivalry uh it's just like the coat of conduct that they
all follow i mean it's malign that makes them who they are is there more i mean do you think that
every kingdom had the same coat of chivalry for every you know knight group that they had
now you're like conflating why are you conflating like all of europe as though it's the same
fring is actually completely right here chivalry was a subjective subjective thing interpreted
by the knights and its most accurate application is uh chivalry means the qualities that make a
knight good at his job and it started with pure horsemanship because chivalry comes from the word
chevalier and if you go back it basically translates to horseman originally and so
if you were good at horse riding or technically combative horse riding you were chivalrous in the
original genesis of the word um and as it evolved it simply expanded to mean the qualities that made
a knight good at his job and when you look i made a whole video on this all right like
specialties and and when you go back and actually look at how chivalry is interpreted historically
there are like there was never a codified unified thing that everyone followed and there were forms
of chivalry that one person would call chivalrous and another group of people would think that's
completely incorrect and their version of chivalry would outrightly contradict something um sorry
about the kids in the background by the way and so so the following chivalry like is a very essential
part of what defines you know a knight to be a knight but not necessarily means that they're
going to be better at mounted combat than uh many other people of the medieval period
and the type it doesn't make their type of mounted combat different from other heavily
armored mounted you know warriors who were not knighted of the period okay and so when you're
looking at heavy cavalry of the medieval period the fact that one group might be knighted and one
group might not be won't change how effectively that you could employ them in combat is my point
similarly like the skill of the dothraki for instance won't change that little sickle into
a lance yes that's correct i mean the circle back something you said stuck with me um
so you said that the code of chivalry was subjective so were the knights like some
sort of post-modernist or something that doesn't
post-modernness
what
where's your connection there i'm i mean i thought i thought chivalry is supposed to
be an objective code of conduct like no no no no no no no the big problem that you have
is that you're assuming that all of europe is like the same and that they all believe the same
things and all of the sort of like europe is not like america it's a whole bunch of different
countries thank god yeah that's absolutely right i mean um when you look at the actual books written
of chivalry like um uh there's one written by crétien de trois and then there's uh like again
i have all the references in my video and stuff like that they are trying to describe how they
feel a knight should act which is actually a direct kind of point of reference to show
that not every knight was behaving the way that they felt they should otherwise there was no point
in them even writing their books in the first place all right and so uh another one was by
raymond lull okay um so chivalry meant many different things depending on how different
areas knights and even wards uh felt what made a good knight and if you did those if you perform
those qualities that the individual wards or even the individual knights felt made a knight good at
their job they were then chivalrous by these individual definitions okay i think i got you
so they're not do you still think they're post-modernists
and i didn't realize there were different codes of chivalry i mean um that's not really something
that pops up well i mean did you did you really think that like british knights had the same
code as french knights and you know yeah why would you think that though yeah that that's
a huge misconception there was no unified code of chivalry that everyone was forced to adhere to
i mean it sounds like you you think that there was like some rule book on society you know like
a society rule book that's like you doing this like this i mean that's what i thought special
night moves nah sorry so you're wrong on that one then right i guess i was so um what wasn't
that made someone like say richard linehard or like some of the other really uh really good
knights what was it that made them so good what was their secret generally success i mean
it was led to success what do you mean like like you know one of the most nice was william marshall
and he gained huge um fame from winning many uh tournaments you know talk like uh just and all
that stuff um but as to active uh service in large in large wars and stuff he had some military
service early on but not to the scale of say richard the lion heart and if you want to look
at some of the things that um certain kings who were lauded at being very noble and chivalrous
some of the things that actually did in in warfare by the romantic view of chivalry they would seem
like massive villains richard the lion heart executed a few hundred prisoners or so because
salad in the armor was stalling and didn't pay certain ransoms and so because the ransom weren't
paid yeah he executed them all uh might not seem very chivalrous i knights and especially kings
when it came to warfare were actually far more uh pragmatists than they were you know i shall not
fight uh you know uh on on unfair grounds and stuff like that you know uh they uh were warriors
first and foremost and they did adhere to the things that they felt were chivalrous but and
also generally they're their direct society but kings more so than anyone else had the power to
go against the grain and do whatever the hell they wanted because not many people are going
to challenge them did you know that sorry richard the lion heart was gay fun fact oh is that rax
king richard the lion hearted was gay so stumbled on can we can we go back to king of thrones and
how terrible episode three was hey hey republican man what what did you think about the trebuchet
has been at the front of the lines what do you think about that i think that gives you the maximum
distance to bombard the enemy before they close with you and so that's the best place to put them
then then right just how long does it take to reload a trebuchet i would estimate around
30 seconds somewhere around there 30 seconds and how long does it take to readjust where a trebuchet
is being aimed at like in terms of the uh the range because the range is determined by the
counterweight and so the weights that you put in the counterweight on the trebuchet and so
if you are facing an army that's charging you and that means their position is in a constant state
of flux because they are charging you you're only going to get one shot of the trebuchet
and so you have to reconfigure the whole setup to try and figure out where the enemy is in already
and by that time the enemy will have engaged you do realize trebuchets were rarely ever used
by a defending army historically they were mostly always used by a besieging army usually
against fortifications a castle the main reason why castles don't move well i mean i know that
they were mostly used to bust walls but i guess they're pretty good in defense against an attacking
army rarely ever used okay and if you did use them well one you would most definitely want to
put them behind a protect of all otherwise they just destroy a good example a good example would
be the battle of um the battle of um what minister where they where both um both the orcs were using
trebuchets to try and um break sort of the castle defenses and they were using trebuchets against a
giant army but they didn't put the trebuchets in the field because like if you put them in the field
then it's like a couple minutes and then they're gone by the way there were also shapes and
catapults in the long night yeah right yeah i have another whole video on catapults that
catapults were not employed nearly to the level that people assume in medieval combat um you know
the trebuchet meme it truly is the more superior siege weapon and also just to your point about
putting the trebuchets out in the front yeah how far out in front of the walls was it like only
was it 50 meters i don't think it was very far because you can see the castle like in the frame
as well yeah so sorry the dead are afraid of fire so this is the thing so that if you're putting the
trebuchet what 50 meters in front of the castle walls and the dead how long would it take them to
charge over 50 meters probably like 10 seconds 10 seconds 50 meters that's let's say 45 seconds
i mean that's pretty slow man i think like
with the length of time that it takes to reload a trebuchet especially just one thing the zombies
are very fast i want to clarify yes and with the length of time it takes to reload a trebuchet
and by the fact you would need to recalibrate it so it would be shooting at a shorter distance
by removing things from the counterweight you wouldn't get an additional shot off by moving
it forward by 50 meters the few seconds that you're gaining won't do a thing you would still
get the same amount of shots from the trebuchet whether it's in front forward like that or behind
the walls i mean i guess the question um republican is like if you in the battle of
i'm i keep referencing fantasy battles but like in the battle of homes deep they didn't put like
anything in front of the wall because like the wall they were gonna reach the wall eventually
so anybody that you put there is dead so the trebuchet couldn't stand on the terrain in front
of me yeah so do you are you leading me to believe that if it could stand there they would have put
it there i mean possibly you think they would have though like you really think that and i don't
know what the rules of the lord of the rings universe are what do you mean what does it matter
it doesn't matter they want to kill him like i don't know if the guy who wrote it i don't know
if tulkian was quite as versed in medieval things as george's decision to put the trebuchets
forward like that it was a show run because george is pretty well versed in medieval stuff
for he's died out in front of the nine like that do you guys the other thing is the show runner
just like totally did what they wanted yes yes yes how would i get away with that once he publishes
the book though because there's no way they don't give a shit you think season eight is
the first time they deviated from the books it's not i've never read the books but i i mean
did you know did you know that the show is ahead of the books right now
so they've definitely deviated from the books then because the books don't exist
but i imagine they still have an outline to work from and they're probably following it because
they know how dedicated game of thrones fans are to keeping yeah they figured that out really oh
hang on hang on hang on hang just sorry your argument was how would they get away with it
they haven't got away with what they did do like they haven't that's everybody's really pissed
everybody's really annoyed yeah like season eight is gonna go down in the anals of history as
yes possibly the worst media that ever fucking got shot onto our tv screens
i mean if you guys think that's the worst thing that's ever happened i have to wonder if you guys
have ever seen things like the funky phantom and um in reference to how it started it is the worst
yes it is among the worst it is certainly internal relevance and significance in its popularity
it is definitely the uh the perspective right because it's it's the final season of a show
that was widely regarded to be a very high quality and yet it's so amateurously written
um like i mean you've already conceded the cavalry point i'm not sure why you're still
arguing about the trebuchets and that if the battle of helms deep was happening that they
would put the trebuchets in front of the wall well just from the things that we mentioned
you would concede that putting the trebuchets forward like that is just retarded it's like
it's never done historically and the fact that they didn't the show was just stupid i love you
but do we do we know with a hundred percent certainty that trebuchets work the same way
in game of thrones they work how would they how would they work at it differently they have
showing us a trebuchet the assumption is yeah you know you know dragons but like gravity works
the same way in game it was it was a counterweight trebuchet they showed it as a counterweight
trebuchet with no deviation from the historical visions r2 the point that were that one of the
big issues here is that you want to protect your siege equipment for as long as you can
so that they have enough time to continuously fire at the enemy although it's not how it works
it's what it does and it showed it i assume i've not seen it it showed it doing the same thing
that a trebuchet does that's how everyone knows it's the trebuchet and even in the shite if we
if we look at the assumptions we've made i mean obviously the dead they just make attacks they
don't defend they have no castle so you can use your trebuchets you can sacrifice them if you want
to what good of them do you or you could keep them behind the walls and use them multiple times
i mean even in the show they only get one shot off before the dead overrun them don't they
i mean any battle that would be considered a complete imagine you had an m1 abrams and it
got blown up after firing one shot it's like well shit that's like 20 million dollars down the trade
and shad um i looked this up real quick maybe you can confirm someone asked what is the rate
of fire of a typical typical medieval counterweight trebuchet this gentleman says that the larger
counterweight has a record load time of four minutes and 20 seconds load 420 that sounds
about right that right so they get one shot maybe yeah no no video games can help us contextualize
this a bit better but four minutes and 20 seconds is an eternity in a battle every second
with a charging enemy with the with the length of time it took for the dead to close the distance
uh they and it's funny because out of all the mistakes they made in that show
the fact that the trebuchets only got one shot off before the dead close the distance does sound
want to be one of the only accurate things which just goes to emphasize the point even more
that if you were going to use them you would put put them behind the bloody walls of your castle
um chad what about the um putting your men outside of the castle walls well even that
is stupid as well like the amount of spare like in my review i said if they had any spare space
inside the castle there should be filled up with you know those men um they have tons of space
they had tons of space in there it was it was i was shocked at how much space was inside the castle
after the dead actually got inside i couldn't believe it they should have loaded up that castle
shoulder to shoulder with their soldiers obsidian tipped arrows even fires whatever as many as they
could and it and then if they couldn't fit everyone in after they loaded up it up as much as possible
you wouldn't position your military in front of the castle you would put it to the flanks the sides
of the castle and get them or sorry you would get the army the dead to hit the castle forward
front on smack them against the walls and then you would close in with the infantry on the sides and
flank them in that in and then if they start to actually focus on the infantry instead of the
castle you'd get the infantry to retreat move around the castle get the dead to follow them
while the defenders on the walls of the castle just ping them off okay and and that's how you
would work it and so the dead they could that would either force the army they're dead to split
their forces to focus on the infantry in the castle at the same time or they would commit
all their forces to attacking the castle or the infantry and if they're doing that when the army
of the dead is attacking the castle you get the infantry to smack them and then if the army the
dead is attacking the infantry you get the castle to smack them i do have one problem like that
like cavalry could come in handy in a situation like that once or twice absolutely because as
soon as you have you know the army they're dead engage with something okay you then bring in the
heavy heavy cavalry to do a massive uh shock impact on their flanks okay because that's not
that those are the positions in which they're not ready to receive an attack on and the cavalry
would be employed to a much much better degree but with the dothraki because they like cavalry
you don't send like cavalry into the ranks of your enemy okay you use them to harry the enemy
because they got swords you run up on the sides slash and then withdraw and then run in again
okay you don't charge in unless they're dedicated heavy cavalry there's one problem with the scenario
you're painting though and that's that they don't have enough provisions to maintain everybody
within the fort so if they all get in the walls then they're just gonna be starved out how how
many provisions did they have did the army of the dead wait to starve them out oh but they could
the night king could just be like all these guys fucked up they're cut off they didn't also where
are you drawing information that they didn't but also where where's your information that they
didn't have enough provisions for the army you just moved a massive number of men to a single
point in a short period of time don't don't you think they would only do that if they had the
supplies to do it though doesn't that make more sense well no here's here's the bigger fundamental
problem like they obviously have enough food for everybody there because they're all there
like what what are you suggesting that when you put them outside they don't have to eat and drink
like that's just gonna step no i'm sure supply lines open to the south where you can import
more food so what's that why does that change if they're outside the walls because if they're not
they don't have a supply line that they're so you're telling me that walls along the road why
wouldn't they just leave them but they can what what's the winner from leaving the castle
so so a couple of things okay um if the army of the dead didn't attack that would have worked in
their favor because they got two dragons that they can just go in destroy them and hopefully
draw out their dragon then draw them back to the castle if they get the dragon but the fact
i was annoyed that the dragons weren't used nearly to the level that they could have been
because they were massively effective um and you know you could say oh but the night king and his
glances and stuff like that is like yeah that's very convenient to the plot he's only good at it
when he needs to be and stuff like that but it's not necessarily um the win move for the army the
dead so wait there wasn't there wasn't really much indication in the show to show to say that they
would wait but having said that waiting is still a good strategy that's what the whole point of a
siege is is to starve them out but it almost seems like the army the dead wouldn't have been doing
that they were marching forward they wanted to penetrate deeper into westeros and to do that
they needed to get past winterfell i didn't see much indication that they had that level of patience
well yeah because if the idea is that they could go around winterfell then why even like battle
them there just like go around i mean that would be an idea to draw them out of their board but
surely it's not an idea to go around because they had to go through i mean you see when you have a
castle if you have the supplies and there seems to be plenty of indication that they did waiting
actually it goes in your favor because it gives you time to rally more defenses game of thrones
lawman here they want to kill bran that's their main goal bran is hidden inside the castle they
assaulting the castle to kill bran oh so they're not going to wait them out then no they're not
going to wait whatsoever they're going to assault as soon as possible well there you go i mean do we
know for a fact that their main goal was brandy because we know yes yes we do yes the final scene
where they all crowd around bran while the night king waits to execute himself that was their only
goal they didn't care about anything else they were going to kill everything in their way
did they just not attack the garden directly then exactly you're just highlighting even more issues
with this show yeah the the the godswood should actually be behind inside all they need to do is
have the dragon do a suicide run i actually have another whole video on how winterfell should look
according to the books there you go another deviation as well from the shows um and the
books the godswood all i'm looking for r2 is that uh you'd agree that it's not very well written
episode three of season eight of game of thrones what do you think yeah i thought it was pretty
well written but has has shadowversity changed your mind whatsoever i mean he he showed me that
there are differences between real medieval war and game of thrones can you tell me why those
wouldn't apply to game of thrones wow i mean i mean i don't think it necessarily makes the
story bad because the story is primarily about story arcs which i guess you guys must not have
watched a more recent video on story arcs because the story arcs but with a k yes that video right
sure i mean so okay i spelled arc wrong you got me on that but um i already admitted that um hang on
but the the combat the fighting the these strong points of conflict they create and are a part
an integral part of the story arc overall you just can't separate them they absolutely are
because like they're a vehicle of storytelling rather than yeah and they're a faulty vehicle
they're a flawed vehicle so like imagine imagine i don't know imagine that a story is like a car
uh or the story is you know like beginning and end of a road and the car is like the vehicle
for the story so the plot is like the chassis um i don't know the characters of the wheel
like let's say the world is the wheels so every time you get something wrong you basically
slashing the tires of that car and making it harder and harder to get to the end point
like in a smooth good way yeah it gets bumpier it starts to drag specific characters though i mean
i actually no no no everything everything is part of it you can't you can't compartmentalize it
but you can prioritize what you think is more important for sure but like the world is really
important especially in speculative fiction if how you arrive at your theme or goal or purpose
whatever you're trying to achieve in a story if if you arrive at that using means that are nonsensical
contradictory have plot holes in them are inconsistent then that is bad storytelling
you just want the reward without putting in the work and without making the effort to have it all
make sense like what if like what if um if you needed to have the good guys win in the battle of
winter fell they were just about to lose but then the fucking marines arrive in their tanks
in their m16s and they blow away all of the undead and they save the castle oh we got our we got our
arc finished for the characters we we won the battle we saved the day but how we got there was
completely nonsensical i guess that would change all the game of thrones into a comedy oh i yeah a
lot of people been laughing at it for certain but it would ruin the story yeah yeah okay like a world
should abide by its own rules and its own internal logic same thing with star wars and war hammer and
mass fact and every fictional world has a grounding in some set of rules that it follows
that helps establish stakes that helps let the audience know that not literally everything is
possible even harry potter has rules and that is that's the big thing right is making sure that
people know that not everything is possible like that there won't be any that i mean there's no
stories stories yeah exactly because stories are built on expectations to some extent and that
means like even if the story does something that you didn't expect it has a logical through line
so that they're you know it would be reasonable for you to expect that whereas like it would be
unreasonable for me to expect that if i were watching episode nine that palpatine wasn't dead
and he's actually coming back and he's gonna fight ray and that's gonna be the end of the series
i mean i don't i don't know what will happen in episode nine i don't think anyone does but yeah
we do i think we know what's gonna happen i think we know exactly what's gonna happen yeah the leaks
have been extensive and ongoing uh to a degree i've never seen before yeah it's kind of unbelievable
yeah it is legitimately interesting do you think it's all just a big fake out by disney
why would they have to get out what do you mean i mean do you think they're just trying to get
one over on the fans by like can i okay i'm gonna i'm gonna use my host powers here i feel
like the conversation has reached a natural end i want to i want to refocus the stream as to what
it was originally intended to i appreciate the discussion with both wait shadow bursty and
remarkable republican bro is gonna say mauler yes mauler yes yeah i don't know if you're gonna
dismiss him or so we can get along but he asked you asked us to ask him the episode nine question
i will do that okay uh remarkable republican who do you think and i i'm gonna rephrase this
question because i don't exactly know how you feel about star wars who do you think is going
to be the character that's treated the worst in terms of consistency in episode nine who do you
think is the character that will fail to live up to who they are intrinsically with what we understand
about them uh in episode nine from what we understand and this is based on absolutely
anything who do you think palpatine comes back it'll be him because oh shit we disqualified
palpatine yeah oh yeah this was this poll we're keeping track we just want to see who gets it
right so before we began we didn't know that palpatine was going to be in this one so we've
disqualified palpatine and i think lando yes lando was disqualified just give us your top
three i guess and then we'll be able to tell you sort of how it works out
well i guess no matter what ray does it isn't really a surprise at this point because she kind
of just does whatever finn has been super inconsistent but i don't uh the asian lady
their buddy hated um they'll probably make her do something that makes no sense again
uh if leah's in the movie at all i mean that when it makes sense i don't know if she's
in a lot of it why why would you no no i just the emotions who do you think will be the one the
street of the ways go for it worst okay that i'm not gonna go with kylo ren all right because i
think we just qualified kylo ren we disqualified him too you gotta pick someone else okay all right
um poe dameron all right that's fair there you go what's your reasoning for poe dameron out of
curiosity i couldn't choose kylo or palpatine but also um they just made him in the last episode
they kind of emasculated him so i don't know what he's gonna do now but it won't be something that
you would expect out of a fighter pilot it'll probably be something really dumb yeah all right
fair enough there you go every every person who comes on efap and is considered a
relatively full-time guest is is given a chance to answer this question so uh thank you for giving
your input uh is there anything else you'd like to say before you uh you hop out um not really just
uh thanks for having me on uh had fun talking to you guys subscribe to my channel if you haven't
already yeah yeah uh remarkable republican you can find him on youtube he makes a lot of videos
about game of thrones and assorted other medias i know it was good to meet you mate um uh i know
a bit of a strange way to meet and everything i just enjoy a good you know healthy debate
so sorry if i come off a bit aggressive at times but um just just like excellent good to meet you
chef yeah good to meet you too man because uh it's just i don't mean to rush just that we've got a
i get you an intention with this stream so yeah uh thanks for coming on my good man and uh
perhaps we shall see you in the distant future all right well have a good night guys thank you
bye see you around bye bye bye i haven't had a headache that intense since the first time we
covered bob i enjoyed that immensely i love that thank you very much for shad for uh coming on
thank you hi so that was yeah hooray that was everything i thought it would be
so we have like 40 minutes of wolf remaining i believe which means we're gonna have to speed
through some memes and then uh i'll have to figure out how i'm gonna i'm gonna work the rest of this
all right but until then we're just gonna look at memes as little tangents as possible people okay
i never tangent so i don't have to worry about anything but all of you guys oh terrible tangents
so what the fun is about i don't know what you mean so we're gonna start with me me and rags
did an efap mini that was like three hours i think and i i like this meme you are live but
we've not crannied the style of efap that one was great love it um oh shit i think we've done that
one all right oh i'm gonna be posting away here i think this is just something that exists
and someone took a photo of it but big idiots is no he he connected the g in the eye oh yeah he
connected it so now it's big idiots i love it that's very good good on you excellent work
you got um all i want for christmas is jay to watch lord of the rings
jay are you getting around to that or what uh yeah yeah i'll get around to that one year
here rags i think you'll like this one
objectively good spuderman oh my god i thought that was his leg raised to the side
too total has indeed risen with the monthly thrust and yeah just you know again if anyone
doesn't know totals video woke style is actually pretty good it's honestly not even that bad
it's a shame he didn't really know it woke me these days i know
so rags are free he'll appreciate the shit out of this would you bring me
to send i miss jacob i want to see what he's slabbed these days i don't care about these
new shitty characters i want the old shitty characters yeah we've come to lid so much about
jacob so this is the battle the endless battle of themes and objectivity of course
oh someone just reminded me i do have questions for shad unfortunately i do not have time to share
with him those questions he will address those i imagine on uh whatever the next stream he comes
on all once once wolf is uh gonna gonna poop off sort of thing we'll get shad his questions if
okay i'll try and hang around
jay what do you have to say about this i want to have to say about
there is no reason not to jay get away from the rhino and put those chairs down you have a problem
at least you know i feel like you'll address yeah i was gonna say you'll you'll probably take
it more seriously when it's in meme form so it shouldn't it shouldn't say jay get away from
that rhino it should say whoever you are true unless you have a name tag or something but yeah
this is i'm wondering who who took this picture obviously it was rags obviously this is um
this is obviously addressing arch's story in that 20 minutes that we had him and sargon on
but how i think someone else got banned because of arch with a profile that matched his name
wasn't that the story i guess the only person who could address that is probably rags
all right this is foreshadowing of what's gonna happen soon enough
uh-huh
ryza skywall it's less than a week away you know you've converted me i did not want to see this
piece of trash but now like seriously i was like train wreck bring it on dude if you haven't seen
some of the leaks for this thing it is have you seen the have you seen the leak stream yeah yeah
like the leaks have just been getting me more and more excited for it it's like this is just
getting worse and worse and it's going to be glorious i cannot wait this is a good meme is
this an e-fat meme or just well i was gonna say how relevant this meme is considering um everything
wonderful
we never even got to talk about the martian theocracy
or the k butler or or taiwan oh i know oh my god so many questions so little i'd love to poke his
brain for an hour or two or three so this is the problem a 12 hours is too small how are we
supposed to fit a full podcast into 12 hours i ask you i don't even know what this meme is exactly
is that ray trying to kill baby yoda i don't really know something's going on here
i don't know the baby yoda is okay with it ray seems to be downright aggressive
you know it's my interpretation i have not seen the film that this is from what is the
film this is from it's picks all right oh yeah this is uh moana moana i've not seen it you've
not seen the kids if you have kids you can't avoid seeing it stop it jay you can't i thought
we wanted it's not fine no shad likes to watch him alone by himself and he just uses having kids
cover phrase is my favorite i don't know why i'm using the movie was trash i'm just saying
oh i've heard that that controversial thing or is that the normal thing i don't know i don't know
i've heard it's not good i don't know exactly what this is but um like what game i guess uh
city of heroes or something one of the few long men remaining in the universe tunnel created the
long meant to counterbalance idiocracy they existed since the beginning of time but most
were wiped out by the sheer stubbornness of idiots he's approximately 1.2 billion years old
and uses psychic powers to aid him in argumentation both defending good films such as joker and
deconstructing bad films the last jedi his nemesis changes from time to time at one point being the
powerful quinton and at another being the charismatic patrick why does why are there lies
powerful and charismatic really i don't know uh but none compared to the speed of diabeto
maulers two closest confidants are the very charismatic doggo rags see that's accurate
and the very enraged canine the dishonored wolf together they have defeated many enemies and even
converted some into allies such as the quite kickable jay xe who had once tried to slander
the long man but was stopped by rhino milk and now aids them in their quest to find good rat
and then i guess we have one for uh yeah this is the dawn the dawn was once a normal man who
enjoyed motorcycles but while his wife was on her death bed she told him that he should try to smile
more upon her death the dawn set out to make the world a better place by giving to charities
volunteering at homeless shelters and even overcame orphan love adopting many children into his home
not even the heartless captain marvel who stole his bike and jacket after seriously injuring his
hand could stop him instead this only reassured the dawn that people like her needed to be balanced
by good men like himself after seeing the goodness that the dawn was capable of tonald had a meeting
with jeff the cosmic chicken and they agreed that they should give don the angelic powers
so that he would be more effective at making the world a better place so it was said blessed be
the dawn and he was made into an angel blessed by tonald and the cosmic chicken
look at that stunned into silence all of you i would i i wonder how if the actor who played
the dawn like watch d-fap i know right just like totally lost rise of mauler am i gonna have to kill
ray i'm not exactly against it i'm just asking that would be a privilege and you do wear a mask
so you fit quite nicely in there rue that's a good one god i guess you disagree
oh massive mauler and the gargantuan gay
fabricated fortification of fire i like that tonal is um gandalf the holy beast
i like that i like talking about dumbledore what the hell
gandalf what the fuck did that come helix
uh first Freudian and now this yeah i like the alliteration on the uh you should all be like you
know instead of our barriers of blockage people say artificial everything it should be it should
be alliterating i think that's better we got um when the moths tell you fap is live while you're
asleep how many other lies have i been told by the cats i have not seen clone wars but i'm sure
that's what that's from so this is um just just your standard meme brown table does feel that
touching a book is sexual harassment oh yeah which means captain marvel is thinking of it oh this is
like someone doing possibly an exam they decided to draw the long man on their book
that was a full there's a full name on there yes i mean well what is this probably several
people with that name i don't know eric bucella is that eric butts's like
it was so bored with their exam they drew me twice
too long for me
yes even i am spooked by uh the long is that exam written in comic sense possibly it is
it is that's how you know it's a legit exam commissar moolah i've got the don bringer as a glove
very cool commissar this is actually a detailed rendition of shinobi of all things
check it out got the jurassic park belt defending what could be a velociraptor
yeah very very cool
good old shinobi shinobi this is um moolah in anime form i believe there is a wolf
version of this as well that i hopefully can get to the legendary longoid
i love the word longoid it strikes terror to many of my enemies i get um so i don't know exactly
what the context of this is i think it's plague creations is next animation
but i'm the pope or at least some kind i think it's a reference to future armor i can't remember
um space pope or something is it space pope i think it might be space pope oh yeah actually
that sounds about right space pope that's such a feature let me look at it um images
is no space pope is close but it's the alligator remember oh yes reptilian oh yeah the garfish
yes garfish are not reptiles though do you have a fish uh shad oh oh wait no he's no no no i'm
here i'm just i meet myself so there's not so much backhand noise all right now help me out here
because before i was like i ate garfish and they didn't even know what it was you know what garfish
is right oh yeah just cheating he's australian i've never heard exactly he's from your fictional
country too it doesn't count yeah it's it's a fictional animal for a fictional country
no no no they're not as bad as the drop bears though so you've got to be
drop drop bears yeah what you you've never heard of drop bears
uh what is that i feel like they're playing us now are they paratrooper bears is that what that is
no no no paratrooper bears yeah fringy no no there's more than koalas and there are there
are cousin to koalas but they have these massive claws okay and they actually they uh they're the
form of attack or oh jesus is that they let go of the the the trees and they jump down
and their claws they just like flay there they're praying oh my god what's wrong with your country
why are there so many holes in everything they're they're out there man they have a wiki for
australia they're like yeah no like for the drop bears they're like the snipes i know what they
should make rags they're exactly like the snipes you have to be oh yeah the snipes old dude people
you know how in like the um you know 10 or 15 years ago you used to buy strategy
guides for video games i feel like you need a strategy guide for this country if you're a
tourist is it like google drop is like do i be afraid or do i love
it
the top bears are great you know that oh my god hang on the plot thickens there's a bigger rib
hang on this is real this is a real picture it's not a they're rescuing a bear from a tree
of course it's real it's not a photo i just saw that and i see it was like a meme or some shit
it's a drop bear did you not drop here
the bear couldn't get down from the tree by itself
well it could it was doing it there it's just you know how did it get up if it couldn't get back
it is harder to climb down trees than it is it reminds me of like you know when you're a kid
you climbed up a tree it's like mom i'm scared it's like you got up there you might not know how
to get down help me like it is harder to climb down something that has to climb up
lies yeah i was a big climber as a kid i still time sometimes
it's a lot easier to climb down the stairs than it is to climb up
yeah depends how many likes you have
oh anyway i guess we should go to the next i was just gonna say by the way this koala
don't mean to drop i'll be right back guys it's okay
the first thing i posted for drop is j it just seems like like a sith lord version of a koala
like if normal koala for jedi these would be the sith version the very very real animal yes also
the bottom line of the lord of rings style one or harry parlour i don't know i said i just glanced
at the cover and now i have fucking aids and that's a quote from tywin lannister just wanted
to make sure we got that got um say he's old again say he's old again i dig double day motherfucker
not so great debate where it all began kind of sort of not really but sort of i like this image
even through pr in there i look beautiful how do you think this was made
oh that would have been drawn probably in paint
i wonder if it's like like photoshop oh like a really good programmer they're like oh paid oh
okay it looks more about something because it's got shading and stuff so it can't be
well you're the one who said paid well yeah but the thing is is like i got betrayed thanks dickhead
um yeah the thing is
no i mean the thing is you can do some really good stuff in paint so i wouldn't take it as like
an indictment against you i would like you can do a lot like i don't know what to tell you i saw
a video where someone did like a photo realistic drawing and paint yeah but that's but that's why
it's impressive because you if because because of paint like you wouldn't see a photo realistic
drawing i go oh that was probably not in paint that's why there's a that's why i saw that video
is that shad battling the welsh dragon what's going on there
well you've got a you've got the isle of man in your eye i do
jay is looking to spank a rhino fair enough that's uh that's my daily routine spank the rhino
every day we got a mcmuffin looks like you're about to stick your finger up his butt again well
that rhino look oh that rhino squirt and something oh my god i always make the rhino squirt
apparently you're milking them the spider saw all of this is that is that an angel mcmuffin
oh this was so the context was this was how people see mauler who like don't like my stuff
i don't like the women's this one i mean what can you say right what can you say about this
we are content parasites terrified you might even say that efab is like the tracing paper of the art
do they know about that oh oh i get it moving on he has a Pikachu toy
wait hang up before i say something do they know about that or not
do not moving on there's a Pikachu going look how adorable that is you know i just i just want to
mention that is adorable sometimes uh you're not what how did i phrase it before i wonder
also that is portion two complete we're onto portion three of the efap memes
why do you serve your efap memes in portion because jay your wife we don't we don't be
careful you do not get addicted to me look at this now look at this crap
what the fuck we watched it we watched a terrible horrible awful tlj because video
and they have these weird graphs that don't make any sense try to explain the balance of what i said
she she goes to the marriage just goes lol no parents oh right i just want to you know just
just so everyone's clear uh you know maybe it's not capitalizing on your criticizing shitty takes
just so you know 100 percent just i just think it's a general knowledge general thing that we
should you know reviewing a piece of media like uh you know star wars or something would be
capitalizing on star wars yeah tracing paper um yes if you were around 12 hours ago you'd know
that this is representative of the video we watched where the defense of the tlj movie is
is quite intense they draw lots of formulas and tisms all over the place oh we got another vision
what what's the meme there why is it mood face that's uh that's the icon of the guy okay
we shall go onto the end we shall fight in france we shall fight on the seas and the oceans we shall
fight with the growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island
whatever the cost may be when it's what the fuck are you doing resisting the nuts oh you want to
read it go ahead yeah i'll read it winston what the fuck are you doing resisting the nazis is
pointless if they'll rise up again if we defeat them there's no point in delaying the inevitable
oh shit fam you're right there's no point they'll just rise up again break out the swastikas boys
they're becoming nazis yeah for context uh the the argument was that what's the point in
re-establishing the jedi when the sith are just going to eventually win oh so just give up what
all right basically yeah that's just that's not an argument that's an argument shut up jab's giving
oh that was that was the fucking thumbnail from wolf stream wasn't it it was i had to show it
so this was me being like you can't present an opposing opinion so instead i'm gonna drop a
pamphlet with an opposing opinion i'll be like oh look a pamphlet it's got nothing to do with me
but why don't you open it and read what's inside i'm gonna go over here now
i like that i'm long in this rendition too oh god another one i didn't realize how many we had of
these look at this i like how they're all slightly different they're increasing with quality every
time true wow that's taken are they still around the jab jabs jib jab i don't know jib jab official
site oh fucking hell look at this fresh meme they are still around jib jabs around rags look at your
fresh meme may come to life well they say like luke threw his lightsaber so that means it's
completely consistent rags like throwing something in the litter throwing a live grenade it's the same
thing oh does someone actually make that argument where he threw it in the ot that means it's
consistent yes what do you mean does someone do that everyone fucking says that who loves tl
i've never seen that in a video before i've just loved it the visual rendition is someone throwing
a grenade at a smiling child he thinks he's candy candy apple that sort of thing so i'm in
a game apparently i don't know which one this is but i like it oh my god a large axe this is i guess
what it's like trying to cover movie pop videos
you're the axe i think that's from dc heroes online i think so too actually what an obscure
reference that is this indiana jones photoshoot absurdly good it really is look at the gas mask
great he's holding a copy of joker too oh shit didn't even notice the gas mask yeah oh
carrots man fuck him oh shit another fresh meme so uh tonaled referenced liquid heat
i'm not sure what that is i think golem was killed by liquid
you can cook carrots with liquid heat
i don't i don't how did this happen i think i got this from our actual chat what does it mean
that's just something i found on uh it's too complicated wonderful and yeah what does it mean
well what does it mean i don't know it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter how much the sequels
will try they'll never surpass the love oh my god so it actually did they won't this is
alien isolation yeah yeah tonaled hiding from the steamed carrot yeah he says cooked carrots
are terrible he hates carrots and i'm fine with wrong they're fine i like cooked carrots are
fine i don't like them raw at all i hate cooked they're fine i don't like them raw either i think
you have to cook them you guys are weird you're from literally a make-believe country
um where are we going next oh after four hours of cinema roberto he's a sad longman
oh crap oh we win that's okay
i thought fringy was upset that i was upset in this picture
i am a little bit upset that makes me sad yep sad man bad
this is another attempt at renditioning tonaled ongoing war with cooked carrots
that's a weird one oh hey look at this combo of old memes and well
uh i can't hear it in kylo ren's voice too it's gonna be okay
oh we looked at that one
this was this is representative of how many straw men he totally destroyed in his video it
was great there were several arguments including but not limited to i wanted luke to be super gary
stew man and destroy everything don't you see person that's not good that is not good
and yet he argued at one point that what people wanted was for snoke to randomly just start
reading out a wikipedia page about his history you know those how many people have you guys
met who absolutely have those arguments i'm just racking my mind because there are so many
yeah it's kind of hard to sort of put a thing not here poe mutes layer then thing here
therefore poe summoned things which led to unnecessary death poe man bad
that's how it works i guess there's nothing else to consider poe man bad um
no you saved the entire fleet anyway oh check it out so you guys have seen uh
fuck what's the name of this one this is pixar as well right co-co co-co yeah i love co-co
oh so good that is a good one love it's playing me a song he is and look who else is in attendance
yay how wonderful oh um i'm not 100 sure what's going on here fringy you want to figure this out i
don't know um i have no idea rags is screaming i am screaming fringy is trying to hold the floor
in some way jumping up in the air i i don't know it looks like i'm a woman as well no you're the
plague doctor scp that's the scp logo on the wall okay all right i think you are right okay right
okay that i suppose that makes sense all right this is uh some fan art of me that's pretty damn
cool i have to put this in the fan art section at some point oh that's that's neat that's really
cool i like the the gas mask portions are now exhausts assassin spring who do you think is
the person who's saying fuck uh it's too small to be bob looks like you're groin oh your groin
is just saying fuck well yeah for some reason my hey my groin is always telling so that that makes
sense this is a wolf commenting that he seemed to be wearing a dress trans dad hand solo just couldn't
fucking accept it what a piece of shit and so he was killed for his bigotry as is appropriate
this is uh my mother made of knives falling on me and giving me scars my knife mom
in your baby yoda yes it makes sense
and then we got you know that was a racist dog whistle i confirmed that wasn't a dog whistle
and then mark brown says you can cook a carrot like a grenade in that upset tonals
oh my goodness what are we dealing with here i think so he said like you know uh luke uh sort
of attacked kyla while he was sleeping did luke do that to vader the answer is yes
oh look at vader he's all happy having his little sleepy sleep
oh i don't have cozy sleeps yes the epic music was playing and it like you know the battle's
over in two seconds he just has a lightsaber in his head i was still playing and he's there like
rose tico answering the call to adventure oh very cute how uh wait that's that's the door
i think right how many such and such is here and then she pauses for a second while you answer
i actually i don't know anything about dora i don't know that's what i mean
we gotta no matter what comes through that gate you'll stand your ground let's look at the themes
runs whatever themes get brought up in videos we're always like oh god here we go
what do you think this is spiss specifically what do we reckon
uh it's kylo is it none is it like a play on the whole kylo dress link dress thing
oh why than a nun get up on him why not a nun
vader would sweat after realizing he's made this enemies that he kills more powerful than
could possibly imagine
waiting for toxic lost jedi haters to lash out on me day one day two day seven thousand five
hundred and sixty seven well i mean he's patient i like the little poised by the door as well
like they're in cover more seconds are starting super chats youtube here's is truck one out of
64 good luck i don't think we've ever had a mr b meme have we oh man maybe they're few and far
between oh a surprise to be sure of a welcome one this is when we when we were told in the video
that it's truly george lucas's fault that luke was a coward oh never get tired of those ones
uh i i heard today apparently that um like george lucas flat out said that palpatine wouldn't have
been in his episode nine yeah yeah well i mean that's what we already knew like yes obviously
but this was planned from the very start we got a kylo red yeah well when he said that kylo was
confused but he still committed to the dark side lights i was like hey he was like oh
this is uh me saying that i was totally on board with seeing a scene where luke just
slashed through a bunch of rebels for no reason i'm on board with this
context pending
oh we actually went through that one all good what is this
i stick my life on it abe lincoln about the monthly thrust i'm i'm i don't know i said i
swore on abraham lincoln's grave that i did and i did i swear that i did you can trust me
oh i guess this was i sent it as a patreon message so this is mauler getting googled mauler is gay
go pink mauler is short that's offensive mauler is the alien is gay
mauler didn't kill himself
mauler is the alien he didn't kill himself i like these these are really
what are the google suggestions if you type in mauler i don't is it terrible
wow someone pull up a google tab let's find out twitter my mother falling on me made of knives
um i yeah none have to do got the isle of man is good rat i think i may have shown this
one already but it's important to to repeat that it is good rat
um it seems i think this is a combo of something that exists already
but his repurpose you got this is his last that is his last he's doing his job then he goes
that's why i'll become that pillar he's the number one hero the symbol of peace i
is there any reason why i'm just there randomly uh because you're on the team
fringy whether or not oh okay i mean i'm not there but yeah that's what i mean
google it i googled it oh yeah he said the he said the layer would survive and he googled it
then we googled the exact same thing that he did and he left out some uh important information
i'm not sure what to make of this one i guess jack saint is back and rags is rags is preparing
with a knife i don't know what's jack been doing i don't know he made a video about skyla white
recently i saw that that's right from breaking bad oh you haven't seen breaking bad then it's me
as an animu grill wow that's terrible i think it's wonderful and that you're a dirty liar
i'm a clean liar okay fine you're a clean liar i love it on the laptop that is
see this is ridiculous why would i fear chat some of these memes i don't even understand
yeah because it knows your secrets you know what yeah i've done this one though
they took the kids they took his keys he's gonna get the back directed by liam neeson
the sard conure oh liam neeson starring conuree it's a stard it's a stard yeah stard man my
conuree my brain is trying to fill in the correct things i g n it makes sense fuck you care jay
translate this uh why am i what um i i don't know no wait jay thanks like the truth jay
no this one like genuinely has me stumped i don't i like cheese i like cheese explain
chat wouldn't just make this up yeah they wouldn't do that um
maybe that's supposed to be ice cream not shit maybe because i like cheese and i like ice cream
is this maybe maybe that shit used to be cheese yeah sounds like lies to me
i think this last selection is goodbye memes you i think we have a couple of lord the rings ones
i i think i have a couple of meme videos that are lord the rings related and i can't show them
because of copyrightisms but we will get to them that's a good meme i think this is going to be an
emote in the discord server i'm okay with that then we've got the many iterations you bow to no
one oh even hugh catman's there
it's an actual picture of you catman too
oh this is the one i was talking about see i got a wolf vision
the greatest and weird yes
it is pizza and weird grapes up there i could seriously go for pizza right now
oh let's let's order a pizza i was kind of thinking about ordering a pizza tonight
i don't know which which spoon man is this uh sorry which one uh that is spoon man too
that's spoon man too okay so the good one the good as long as it's not spoon man three
yeah i don't know it's not the amazing spoon man too that's the thing what is this uh
originally um i don't know i like how rags is always a woman in this
i like how you fap chat is a person
i'm glad that the don attended my funeral absolutely
oh my god it's 7 30 a.m for me i'm gonna have to hop out soon when the when the store's open to
go to the store to buy cheese to buy cheese and poop what is the fucking difference jay really
yeah jay
jaymonary someone could actually just like manufacture a thing like that and make it
just just by sending in a meme that people will assume there's more context for
i think is he supposed to be a character in this or is that just a logo that's attached to the
image i don't know i guess uh everybody's saying goodbye is efap all right i follow
oh hey i know this one this is fast and the furious
yes oh this is good i like the blur albeit rags it works for for sense of depth yeah depth of
field yeah that's really this is a really well put together one this is really great
i don't like this when you guys get the where the meme three two ones back was from
the anime thing the anime one no neon genesis evangelion oh i had no idea
and we got some some original drawings coming up
that's a good one hmm got a stick sweet is this is the stick of staff is it a reference to gundulf
or is it something else might just be a walking stick since i don't want to hike do you have like
a stick at home that you really cherish that kind of looks like a family stick or i i can't
is that your family stick wolf is that your family wolf you have a family stick be honest
every family yes every family has a stick i've got my family stick right here family stick
no i can't maybe it's a dog's like a family family has a stick uh every every
family has a stick this is a reference to my ds2 series i believe this that's what the person
posting it said on twitter it's quite nice oh this is the tism guy he drew the tism wizard
oh wow dude that was a cool pretty sweet drawing i've got something dripping off my mask i assume
it's estus because that's all it could be and it's probably tears no estus i got oh god i've
got coming out all right i've got i'm counting it coming out of my eyes you've come coming out of
yours yeah it's you know it it happens are there any dogs that are allergic to dogs
yes i i don't let me google it it's a sweet bit of fan art as well
the many faces of catman looks very aggressive i think he's just how great
he's mad at me for not feeding him i guess
feed mr catman i think you've seen a lot of these before because they're through twitter
i just want to make sure you saw him yeah he's cool yeah catman oh catman's a mini wolf
well that's a normal sized cat nope mini wolf i like this pizza the pizza just showed up
everywhere it's great infinite pizza i demanded i like this one a lot it says goodbye all by
n words goodbye all my n words god look at look at everyone there's your shad with a sword
that's bullshit bringing smile stuckman even stuckman there's rhino jay longbone
why would stuckman be here no no i i think that's uh the joke with southpaw he looks like christmas
because of course chris stuckman wait is that two robot heads on the
just above rags ea and then just to though it's doomcock is it oh the other one um yeah
that looks like you could be right okay yeah because that's doomcock yes it looks like these
two robot heads um those you could pretty easily manufacture robots right let me look what i'm
getting most out of this image is that mauler is just really tall everyone else is really really
small i mean it's the curse of the long man what can i say
i don't know if you've seen this or not this is uh one of bayouins
i have not but i like it or in the blind forest in a pizza keychain yeah out in the mountains
what's that thing to my left uh maybe bonfire maybe
i like it oh that's a good one yeah that's a nice one it's really nice look at that that's lovely
that's so good that is really good that landscape is really great like yeah and this one is also
from twitter i think you've seen this already as well i have not oh that's cool farewell on a wolf
a sheep in wolf's clothing or a wolf in wolf's clothing either way or a dude in wolf's clothing
yeah all right yeah thanks guys fuck you australian guy he was absolutely nothing like a sheep so
yeah but it's uh whatever but yeah that's uh that's it for the memes i believe let me check
i've got a few more that are cycling in but it's kind of tough for me to get them without
delaying for a while how much time you got wolf i i gotta go like now because i gotta be up in
five hours to go in that case what i'm gonna do right is begin reading the super chats once
once you've left what i'm gonna do is open a new notepad and pile every single thing that addresses
you into it and then when we record and this could be a while but it'll happen when we record the
remaining copyright related memes i will read out everything that's addressed to you and show you
any memes that address to you in that potential privatized recording thing that will be released
as a mini that does that how does that work yeah that works i'll be pretty busy for probably
the rest of those so you might not be able to record it until i late this month or early january
early january there you go guys besides i'm gonna need time to edit it anyway because of
copy tisms but um yeah that about seals the deal for your last efap um i don't know like i said
people have sent a lot of messages in super chats you will receive and respond to them um
it's gonna be i'm just gonna try and find a way to make sure i catalog everything so it's easier
for wolf to sort of uh see and respond to them like i said uh but other than that i suppose it's
uh it's been a wonderful journey we're up to what this is 65 right you almost hit order 66 wolf
you almost there gonna kill a whole bunch of jedi with us well i had to bail out because you know
i true true but at least you got to see tonaled's first good video i know it's like this is the best
efap to end on because we get tonaled being good we get tlj defenders still being horrible and then
we got a ton of memes that had a bunch of callbacks to old memes it's it's like the best callback
episode absolutely it's been fucking great and they'll be available soon enough once i i don't
know when i'm gonna sleep sleeping's gay we're never gonna do it it's fine um but yeah it's uh
efap would not be the same without you so thank you so much for uh being with me and rags up to
this point as well as the other gentlemen who have been on guests with you as well it's been
very fun as well as very meaningful we've made something really great together and it wouldn't
be the same without you yeah it's been fun and i i do want to say because people thought this
i i'm not stopping talking to all the efap related tisms and people like i i'm just not
going to be on twitter or youtube anymore i'm just cutting those out because i don't feel like it's
good for me mentally i i'm not gonna stop talking to mauler rags for j shad and all them i'm still
you know i'm not cutting my friends out of my life yeah we gotta watch uh avatar right yeah
and the mandalorian no
no like honestly it it gets really really bad i think you know no no listen you'll you'll enjoy
how bad it is rags this isn't making me watch you will enjoy how bad it is just like you'll enjoy
how terrible episode nine is no i won't enjoy the star wars no the only thing i'm going to enjoy
is ranting about it with other but much as i do hey well you can do that yeah we can do that
me and rags do it weekly with friggy i'd battle we all just fucking rants about how terrible it's
gone yeah we do really just deteriorated so much yeah uh i'll just before i go i'll say
i started doing youtube when i was teens so it's been eight years now across multiple different
channels and uh yeah i i feel like i just it some people can do it some people can't i'm clearly
one of the people that can't and i need to cut out things from my life that are good for me
mentally so you know it's it's been fun really like all the fun memories i've had and uh yeah
doing nefap has been really fun too but time to start doing something a little bit healthier for
me absolutely and we've loved the time that you're given uh and you can tell from chat you got you got
a lot of love there too thank you so much for uh everything and we're all hoping that you get

bye bye bye um goodbye my n-word yeah it feels weird happening on a christmasy episode
as in you got the snow falling in the background it's like okay um snow i like how people are now
saying don't let wolf down fringy you made a problem all right so i've got a whole bunch
of extra memes like like 20 that are going to get transferred and sorted out but i'm not
doing any more memes for this stream we have five hours and 50 minutes remaining i am going to read
super chats and i'm going to open up a notepad and save every single one that's directed at wolf
and i'm going to skip over them uh instead of reading them out because it'll make that's going
to be quite a few it is a lot of them are directed at wolf but that's what i'm trying to say is all
the people who've made videos who are concerned they weren't shown on this stream if they had a
hint of copyright i was basically adamant and not showing them to make sure this stream didn't go
down um i've got there someone just said you skipped the scroll of uh there's a meme i went
over but it was really long so i've kept it for a future meme we will read it no worries um future
memes will all be like i said i'm just gonna basically collect everything into that that
recording what once me and rags and wolf can set up a time we'll make an efap mini we will check
out memes that are relevant that he's missed we will look at videos and um i'll i'll read to him
all of the super chaster directed for him and we will release it uh but until we hit that 12 hour
ish cap i am now going to start reading super chats uh obviously fringy j shad even rags if any of
you feel that um you may have hit your cap you're welcome to bow out i can stay for a bit longer you
mentioned that there were questions though yes actually yes i want to address those um because
i like questions and i don't don't want anyone to miss out and anyone else see i've got to go uh
now but i will like i can i might be able to hop back in later today if you guys are still good
it's possible uh i will i will say tootley pep for now tootley pep sir tootley tootles
and fringy anything you want to say or you good
all right okay he's gone off to work on that video he's promised everyone uh yeah he doesn't
want to let them down so i'm looking at my like i post i it's very untidy i post a lot of the
questions i have for people all in the same section i try and begin them with the name
that they're relevant to and i've got one for rags that i hadn't read so oh rag are you ready
for this uh yes this says rags mayo blast my salami socket it's deli time and the first slice is free
all right so two things one that wasn't a question no it wasn't it's more of a comment really
there's more but how can i have it so that this wasn't read to you how could i how could i
possibly do that he made freaky leave oh no he said salami socket free i'm sorry
i'm so sorry that's the one wouldn't rise to mayo blast i should have known i should have known
uh that sounds like a great time yeah maybe one of these days don't count it don't don't count it
out um i've got another another three for you uh again not necessarily questions but things
i i guess i felt i should read out to you from people so you got rags loving the dog bites vids
oh thanks thanks i've got some um i've got some planned this the last i just always seem to be
busy with this and that and then i get tired and sleep and hopefully soon hopefully soon i got
some planned out and i got new thumbnail stuff made so that'll kind of help as well now there you
go this one says rags what is your opinion on breeders of the neff lime nefflim alpha
oh i haven't played it oh well there you go i don't play it but i i'm thinking about because
i've got some um i've got i've got a bunch of reviews i'm uh probably gonna have done fairly
soon for exclusively games i'm thinking about actually making a review of breeders of nefflim
but i'm also thinking about doing a legit raid shadow legend because it has been it has become
kind of like an actual meme around the internet so i would be interested to really play it and
kind of see what's up with it oh hey yeah i'm back sorry my blue my my computer blue screen
i know you're upset when i said salami socket you don't have to hide from me i get it oh sorry i
would have missed that um however like i actually probably there's probably like a good time to hop
off because i need to like make dinner and also if i'm gonna make good on my my you know my christmas
promise then i need to hop off to write what i'm working on catch you around mr i i i think it will
be something that will be very unexpected but i think if it all pans out and i basically like
put my head down for the next 10 days oh my god it'll be something real cool i hope excellent
yeah all right aren't you you're gonna review cats and you're gonna love it and tell us oh
yeah cats comes out in like two weeks yeah we can see that so we can that'll be our palette cleanser
after episode nine what really that's how that works oh finally oh episode nine's done star wars
is over we can watch cats oh man i totally forgot about that but i'll have to put that on the watch
list all right uh catch you gentlemen later well yeah see you all right okay see you later babe
see you later okay so next up for rags and i feel like this is redundant but i'll ask it anyway so
rags you managed to get a copy of breeders of nephilim alpha can you give us a little review
it's on steam you don't need to like you don't need to suck someone off in a back alley did it
to get a review code for it all right it's on steam and no i if anything i click that
as a meme so i could screenshot it and send to somebody but like wolf got it he made the
that i have not played breeders of nephilim um and the the follow-up was uh where can i find
wolf's books to buy wolf is not currently you're not able to buy any wolf books in any way shape or
as of right now um moving on we've got to do where are the shad questions okay and there's a few
let's get going shad why do you sound like grandpa george from c-a-t-c-f i intentionally
do it to my voice so i sound more authoritative oh there you go that's a quick answer effective
well you know you've got to cultivate this voice there's a lot of practice gone into it
catapultivate is what do we trebuchet to vape that's the superior version
that's when i start doing david attenborough's when you know i'm trying to be serious and here
we see an australian the catapult is one of the greatest weapons ever made
uh next one hey shad weird spot to put this but i'd love to see the crouching tiger hidden dragon
jiao long versus shulian fight as a potential autopsy shall in well that would be a long one
but gee oh that's a great fight scene absolutely and a classic you know i think i'd actually i think
i do need to put on my list because i kind of want to hit some of the most iconic fight scenes in
cinema and stuff the fight scene autopsy i was thinking of doing um wesley versus enigo montoya
from um princess bride but the thing is with star wars coming out soon as like oh i really
okay i'm gonna do um luke versus vader before just because it coincides nicely so i'm trying
to do that for this week if i can get them done hey shad if you're gonna put your money on the
choreography being good or bad in episode nine what would it be oh it's like i've seen the trailer
right and from what we have seen in the trailer it is garbage like the telegraphing and the wide
baseball back swings and it was just like one small shot yet both ray and um kylo they're just
as horrible as before it's like it hurts myself so sorry uh next up shad about the shish kebab
what if the gas tank was on your back and the tube that leads to the torch fitted through your
outfit still a bad weapon um i don't know i see it's technically it's just a flaming sword then
the cable could certainly get in the way especially with the amount of movement that you put into a
certain sword moves and stuff the the cord could get tangled quite considerably um sorry it's hard
to say it's hard to say i'd want to kind of test it out like i actually do want to do a video on
the protosaber and i have a very upset baby in the background sorry sorry
speaking of a protosaber what nothing just throw a grenade at her oh no that might hit him
with pieces of shrapnel fly into shad we can't have that oh yeah that's right you'll block it
with his sword true true i like that people sometimes highlight that they're like how stupid
star wars is already look they use swords like why would they use like why are you talking about
realism they use swords it's like um yeah the swords are pretty fucking good when you have a jedi
behind it yeah man clearly that's working pretty well someone with a gun gets the blast deflected
into them they're like on the floor bleeding out going you idiot using the sword he got me but
still stupid uh rags what do i do when we're on questions for shad but he's currently busy
oh i guess i'm still here kind of listening but just trying to cut out some of the
the noise do you want to carry on or we can continue absolutely very well shad thoughts
on memory sorrow and thorn trilogy which which trilogy memory sorrow and thorn
now i'm unaware of this i don't think i've heard of it yeah unfortunately i just copy
these so i don't actually know like anything more sorrow trilogy well actually the last part of
the sorrow trilogy is going to release in about a week so we're going to see how the the the sorrow
trilogy comes together yeah i don't know it's all right all right uh shad in for honor the first
unlocked night class executes enemies by holding the blade and striking with the guard is there
any merit for that oh yeah absolutely that's called the mordhau or murder stroke uh mordhau
being german for murder stroke and yeah absolutely uh it's it's a move used against armored uh
opponents so if you've got a long sword and you're fighting someone against who's wearing armor
grabbing the sword by the blade and striking with the cross guard is one of the maneuvers you can
use which is more effective against armor than striking with the blade itself so it kind of turns
it into a club so the answer is yes absolutely uh shad thoughts on anakin's move to cut off duku's
arms or hands i guess yeah that's an interesting one he kind of uh again you just have to put up
with the glorious background track but um that's what happens when you're a father but anyway
you guys can still hear me even yep yeah um it depends it depends because he kind of holds duku's
hands off to the side and he brings his lightsaber down around and then up cutting his hair his hands
off at the wrists with this upward kind of sweep and duku wasn't really doing much with his
lightsaber up to that point if i think anakin might have been completely open i need to look
at it with a closer eye but i suspect it was a poorly executed a bit of choreography because
duku might have just been out uh sweep his lightsaber across anakin and chop him in half
and he might have just been standing there to take it so again i need to see the double check
but that's what i remember from it uh shad i've not seen a take on the s-talk sword how would
you rate it as far as capability and legilla leg legality lethality maybe a misspellability
oh yeah probably i'll say the s-talk is a very underappreciated and underused weapon and more
i will say that yeah it's a it's a more specific um specialized weapon and there are some that
didn't even have an like a blade edge on them it's purely for thrusting and you could you could like
sometimes consider it the two-handed two-handed thruster some might call it a two-handed rapier
but rapiers generally have swept hilt more iconic related to them um the s-talk is a beastly weapon
for what it is meant to do and that's a mistake that a lot of people do they generally try and
like gauge swords on universal application taking them outside of the specific context in which they
were made and meant to be used for and so i mean the s-stock would sucks at cutting like absolutely
but as for its thrusting capacity it's one of the most devastating thrusting swords ever made
so yeah for what it's meant to do it's a great weapon
and uh i i mean this isn't necessarily connected but a part of this is also opinions on the s2
spring steel as a material i need a look like i i unfortunately i can't remember the qualities of
s2 spring steel because i've looked up several different um qualities of steel for saw blades
and there's a couple of different interesting ones that came up to the top of the list but it's been
too long since i've reviewed my notes on it that i just can't remember the names of each definition
so i wouldn't be able to tell you off the top of my head fair enough um oh this one's interesting
i don't know how this is gonna go over uh so shad should call matt dillahunty on the atheist
experience i believe this is in reference to whether belief is a choice is that right right
oh that was a deep discussion we were having there it was it was great and i would say
something that i've been reflecting on since i haven't really come to any new conclusions or
thoughts but it's certainly you know something got me thinking okay you know what is what is
the nature of belief um but i don't have anything new to really share on the matter
yes i mean i am i am a simple messenger i am completely innocent if there is nothing
anyone wishes to add i shall i shall move the f on as as a civil person would say unfortunately
i don't know what they're referencing the atheist experience was it he's a call-in show based out of
austin texas i think okay um shad i'm a mormon member of the church of jesus christ
of latter-day saints as well what do you think of the recent changes i think they're actually
very pragmatic and good um what changes um what changes for those of us who aren't on
they're just some administrative changes and so uh uh small things um uh there are different
auxiliaries and organizations in the church um and so these auxiliaries are like uh priesthood
and young men so there were there are two different priesthood quorums elders quorum
and high priests and they're being combined into just the the elders quorum and and so the thing
that needs people need in the church that need to understand is that none of this contradicts
doctrine because there's a difference between doctrine and principles and principles are the
practices and even commandments that are instituted to achieve the purposes of the doctrine and many of
the uh the institutes and organizations in the church the uh the practices that are adopted and
these are things that are being updated are all in line with the doctrine they are just changing
different procedures to achieve it more efficiently in the modern day so there we go
i love that like so few people are gonna understand any of the context yeah i'm not gonna
pretend to be able to ask you follow-ups on that i'll just be like hopefully hopefully
that answers the person's question um shad how do you feel about the soul reaver sword
um it's a bit out of proportion it's the one with the really wavy blade with the skull above
the handle if i remember correctly the skull seemed to be a bit oversized which would throw
off the balance unless it was like hollow and it was just a kind of a an external facing just to
get the look um then it could still be functional but i i can't remember the finer details to really
comment on any more any more specificity than that unfortunately all right um
see some of these i don't even know the context how many eight foot people do you know shad
not many i don't know i feel like the answer is zero how many eight foot people do you actually
do i can't think of one yeah i mean i mean i've completely forgot the context of that one um
oh look at this one hey mauler i have a question for shad will we ever see a return to the rogue
star universe oh i would love to but i don't think um this is coming from a youtube channel
that my brother launched and i was one of their founding members of it uh tabletop time where we
did role playing games and stuff and i was great and i ran a campaign called rogue star
which was very popular and that was very story driven um and uh unfortunately doesn't doesn't
look like we'll ever be returning to tabletop time because my brother's just too busy but i'm
sitting the groundwork to launch my own role playing channel uh hopefully it could start next
year once i get my studio built and things um and will die would i do another rogue star campaign
maybe maybe not i don't know i wonder if you do other campaigns and things uh but i do want to
kind of frankenstein certain elements from the rogue star universe into a sci-fi
allow book setting that i might want to write sometime in the future so there might be vestiges
of rogue star still seen uh that also ended with also high rags hello and uh is this gonna be like
an online thing you do irl tabletop sort of thing
sorry what was that was there a question for me is yeah is this going to be like a
an online rp sort of thing or a tabletop like in physical form in a room in your house that you're
doing or yeah so i find the best kind of gameplay and interaction happens when you have people in
the same room together and so that's what i'm kind of going for and uh and so yeah my studio will
give it like i'm building a studio at the back to give me you know for instance i could do uh
chats like this and there won't be as much background noise and things so just to make
working a little more convenient but also to give me opportunity to launch some additional
kind of projects and one of them being that and so trying to get a good group of guys together to
yeah do some do some up good old rpg i didn't know you're into that that's really good i'm kind
of starting to get into it as well and i'm really like it yeah i've been i've been into it ever
since i was 12 years old i'm old schooler yeah i started with first edition dnd went through
advanced dnd third edition fourth edition was an abomination and uh they didn't regain my trust to
try out fifth edition and by then i had made my own wall system with my brother hmm very interesting
there you go um uh someone wanted you to say i love you in a heartwarming voice shad
well go on then as in you oh you want me to say it this super chat once i i i believe it
asked you to say it or me to say it for you to say it i love you was that was that was that
heartfelt did it come that was beautiful i think i could try it i could try more more emotion
i love you there you go there you go oh don't recall that gorgeous uh oh shad i recall you
saying you really enjoyed the game dragon's dogma if i'm correct what was your preferred class
mystic knight is mine i did like it first off dragon's dogma is actually my all-time favorite
game no game has actually topped it i like oh and the fact that they've never made us well
they might still but to this day there's been no sequel is
breaks my heart and no the online version doesn't really count as a sequel um because it was only
released in japan how dare they uh so yeah the mystic knight was actually that's why the game
was so good so many of the classes were fun i made probably over 100 characters and that's
probably about true in jagga's dogma playing through on the hardest mode and all that and
i did all the classes i mean the starter classes are lukewarm like luke you know watered down
versions of their higher classes and i usually did a hybrid one so i could get the right uh feats
and bonuses from all the other classes to get the get the you know the toughest character that you
could and things but of course the mystic knight was awesome but i couldn't stand that the shield
was always on the back of your character whenever you move and you only held the character in your
arm when you didn't attack that bug the heck out of me so if there's any criticism i'd say it would be
that i actually i think that might actually be all of the ones meant for you at least
not including the ones that may have been sent in this stream not a worry i've gone um
i've got one copy here that says ask rags the use figuratively for literally question i think we
did that we're not shad is gonna agree with me i know it no well i mean it wasn't even i think i
even i said like no we don't destroy words even more let's not like literally does not mean
figuratively so the idea is that a whole bunch of people have used literally to mean figuratively
so much that we should take revenge by using literally to mean figuratively and i said i
hate that idea because we'll just kill the words even more uh yeah i don't know how that's getting
revenge on him it'll ruin everything even more um yeah the proper definition of literally literally
has a very use or important use in language yes and so i say let's try and keep it yeah i
understand that dictionaries are descriptive not prescriptive and they and eventually words
change in their meaning but literal is a very dare i say it literal thing like it is very useful it
has a lot of utility to that being used the way it is especially and i i would really rather not
have words mean their opposite unironically gotta draw the lines we're gonna draw the line
somewhere i know it's just awful it's this is the kind of shit that keeps us out of living in caves
yeah this is this is how everything falls apart this is how everyone dies okay so we're beginning
yeah i like because i actually agree with you because yeah language is more fluid but for the
i like the original the proper meaning of literal is so useful i'll fight against any cultural kind
of sway to try and push it against it but if it gets to the point where everyone has lost the
meaning i don't know if that would ever happen i hope not i would then just you know have to go
with the flow but at the moment we most people do remember the proper meaning of literal so let's
keep it i agree with this man yeah that's my controversial take i suppose uh let's see what
else i think i might have more for rags and here's like people someone said yeah but people don't
use figuratively that often because like i almost think that it's more implied than explicitly
stated when people are talking about things figuratively they don't normally say figurative
you know figuratively a lot of the time you know when they're talking about an analogy or
just using it to refer to something and you could just kind of pick it up without them having to
say it um but all right guys i better go i need to help out my wife with the kids and so well sure
no problemo if there are any more questions i shall save them for you sir it has been a joy
as always it was particular fun to come on in such a heated time and come through thank you so much
for being around what you did that was i think that was wonderful for so many people including
wolf i know he had fun listening to that it was great so anyway thanks guys i appreciate you
inviting me and i'll i'll see you next time i shall catch you around goodbye sir farewell bye bye
that leaves me and you rags what are we gonna do huh what are we gonna oh i don't know i guess we
could we could do all these super chats we will try um at least we could get started on them from
i got this one that i i believe i skipped over for the sake of time before and now i'm looking
at it and i'm like okay so you got knights of ren golden company snoke jaws sequels dark fate pandas
s u i guess steven universe i don't know polio watson vader all my sanity which wins the title
of most redundant so i suppose i suppose i suppose we will choose one each which one do you think is
the most redundant i know that i went with the golden company because of the fact that in season
eight of game of thrones they don't actually need to be there for anything to change they
are the the other the epitome of the word redundant they don't serve any purpose whatsoever
so we got not or no longer needed or useful knights of ren they're supposed to show up in
episode nine so they might do something they might do something golden company what you said
snoke snoke is not redundant the problem is that he is extremely important he is vital for the
story but he's just basically treated as if he's not we don't know how specifically he's
important we know he's important yeah we don't know exactly how jaws sequels i haven't seen the
jaws sequels actually so uh dark fate you've seen i haven't um i don't know i call that movie
redundant i mean things happen people live and die you know i mean like it's not you know
yeah then we've got pandas uh pandas are good for tourism and they're good for some
you know symbolism and stuff like that like a lot of ambles s u that like i said i don't know if
that's steven steven universe or something else i don't know s u is yeah someone will go through
the list someone tell me what s u means i'm assuming steven universe i don't know what else
it would be maybe check that can confirm while they go around uh the horn next we have polio
polio is just well it's it's definitely not needed or useful so it's certainly redundant in that sense
um and i and we've basically cured it and we've basically eradicated polio because of vaccines
watson as i assume in watson and as opposed to sherlock homes um depending on how it is he's
like a grounding for the character he's uh every man to be almost like a foil for him his assistant
um depending on the iteration of uh homes we're talking about it might be that he can't function
normally without that normal person to you know kind of keep them on track and all that it depends
vader is definitely not redundant i mean he performed a very important task for the empire
the connotation there is that he couldn't even kill the emperor because he's back so does he
become redundant i don't know he killed he still killed all those jedi definitely did a lot of work
or my sanity i don't know about the state of your sanity so i couldn't uh couldn't couldn't say um
we've got soviet union in which case yeah that's definitely no longer needed steven universe is
probably what makes sense um simply unresistible uh shelby uganda uh stupid uranium
i still think the golden company is the most redundant out of all of them
they serve no purpose they just get shut erased stargate universe i i don't i don't know if it's
i don't know anything about steven universe other than their fans are very understanding
and happy to discuss things with you so um so what do you go with
um the most there
yeah most redundant probably golden company all right there we go i did it that's that has been
answered rags i have a dumb question what the frick happened to v you mentioned him during
a dumb in episode 60
what happened to him did something happen to him i don't know is that was there a steven universe
thing you interrupted a question jay you will wait your turn all right i'm about to head out
so if there's a question for you it's answering i can do it now and if there's not i'll just go
how redundant is steven universe what like to the story i don't know not or no longer needed
or superfluous um what to the events of the story he's like vital he makes everything happen
i don't know man it just says su and i assume it maybe means the show yeah how redundant is the
show um i mean how redundant is any piece of art pretty redundant now that the finale happened
maybe that's what a finale finale made everything kind of like not matter it made like the events
of everything just oh okay so if it was that easy to solve why didn't you just yeah i'm gonna
i'm gonna head to the store now all right thank you jay anytime all right thank you jay what a
piece of shit he completely interrupted your question as to what happened to v is he is he alive
i hope so glad now we can get some work done in here um the next question is hyrag recently got
divinity os 2 after watching your vid i am greatly enjoying it thought the physics magic
armor negating cc would bug me but no yeah um and there's a lot and there are uh mods to change
that if you if you change your mind and decide that you don't like this armor system then you
can easily install one of the many many mods for the game that instead replaces the armor system
with the willpower system instead which is very interesting i'm going through a playthrough of the
game intermittently using a highly modded version and i'm having a good time there's a lot of
different ways to play but i'm glad you're liking it definitely a fantastic fantastic game um and
that is all the questions i have saved for either you or sad no sad we've got some left for archen
and i think we got one for that star wars girl and i'm just giving her one for gary
um one for a collective of three people i'm not sure when that one will be run out and that's
about it and i've moved all of the wolf ones into a file and i'm now going to start on the super
chats i like i said i'm going to skip over the ones that are questions for wolf and save them
fall into a big notepad so yeah rags you ready i am ready here we go first one do you guys like
the end of mando episode six where the rebels show up and decide to destroy the entire station just
because the track is there and let mando escape imagine mando left the tracker at a preschool
and then flew away since when the rebels murder people just because a prisoner might be there
yeah that is definite that is something that made our job as a good a good little
finisher for that terrible episode we were already pissed we had the rebellion being
murderous psychopaths and before someone says hey man they were launching an attack vehicle
or whatever it's like you have no context as to why they are launching that like you can't just
assume that they're they're hostile destroy the entire base like wow and they destroy it instantly
and now what utterly disappointed in the uh the republic the new republic whatever they fucked up
holy shit really disappointing what can you do monstrous action that they just took um yeah
we're only two two episodes remaining before we can do an efap episode all about mandalorian but
as you can probably tell me and rags you know how do you how do you put this uh not huge fans
so far three was pretty pretty bad well i don't it was not good i'll say that three was not good
four five and six were bad they didn't destroy it did they they you see several shots like
that seem to explode large portions of the base they're just attacking random pieces as well as
the the the hangar bay that they shoot seems as though they're okay with destroying the entire
thing that's the impression i guess also we got um more will you post the sargon failed stream
so we're rescheduling with sargon and arch we're gonna try and get a full stream done with them
eventually the uh the 20 minute one that we had um i don't know what's the easiest way to access
that if you want i was gonna release it as a mini i'm not sure about it anymore like it's
because it's a weird video if it does get released as a mini it's kind of just like
i don't know i'm not i'm not entirely for or against that as an idea i'm not sure yet
um this one just says uwu what should i do with this ranks
hmm um what do you feel is right kill it no no i i agree with him i i also think it
flamethrower i think you should give into your inner uwu flamethrower no
oh let the uwu flow through uwu you um hello all let's get started actually got alerted this time
as well let's get started yeah that that was my goodness right that was 13 hours ago that that was
said time has traveled to say the least uh what happened to the sargon stream so my internet is
currently having serious issues um they need to dig up my front lawn and replace several core wires
before everything will be fixed luckily for me the internet is not intermittent right now uh
however my phone line is dead and so everyone has to call through their mobiles which because we're
in the future isn't as much as a problem as it would have been like 10 to 15 years ago but yeah
that's probably gonna be fixed in january because i seriously doubt they're gonna set up to fix
the dig up a front lawn during christmas time seems unlikely luckily for me that means that
my internet still works and that we still can stream uh which will be the intention with rise
of skywalker unfortunately that happened on the night that we had the first stream with sargon of
a cad the notorious person who destroys everything am i right conspiracy theorist there's a lot of
ideas that he was actually the reason it got destroyed i don't know why that would be something
that people would think but we nearly had it on friday unfortunately um sargon was exhausted
because he did a really long stream talking about the uh the brexit well no not brexit it was an
election yeah uh yeah almost um he was obviously very thrilled with the election very very happy
so he probably was up late he did a stream while yeah you and our efap mini i think and he streamed
for a long time he streamed longer than we did and the following day we were all set to go but
he was ruined and so he even said he didn't want to come on to as a pool performance he wants to uh
be sort of active and engaged so we've still got the video we've still got a
good efap planned for that it's just it's probably going to be in january now because uh
we've got the 21st and then theoretically me and rags could do a stream on the 20
we'll have to we're gonna have to talk about what we're planning for christmas if we're planning
anything i don't actually know but uh efaps christmas times more to come i'm sure of it
um pewdiepie is taking a break from youtube is that true i don't know i don't know i don't know
but uh if he feel he needs to take a break then do it take a break take a vacation
the incident can be a nightmare um i'm just looking at his newest uploads i don't see
anything about title saying taking a break but you know maybe um anyway uh tlj and rise
of skywalker might suck but at least it brought us all together looking forward to the reviews
over the movie itself unlike rise of skywalker they'll be glorious oh yes we've got there's
gonna be hundreds of reviews to watch who knows we might even find some new content creators
it will consume us as rags said on i think it was world class bullshits high council stream
this will be an opportunity for new creators to really get their name out there if they make
if they make the video with the take you know yeah because it's not just one of those things
you can have a hundred people who have a really strong take and they all get to get a boost
through this hot topic um obviously i'll be making a video rags will you make a video on
rise of skywalker i might or maybe we'll just do a stream on our channel or i will do uh
if we'll do a special efap on it maybe i don't know maybe uh that'll be a good opportunity to
do a stream on my channel i'm not sure haven't decided yet if we're not we're i know we're
gonna do an efap maybe that's all we'll do but it'll be either way it'll be a hell of an efap
give me a long one again i'm not even sure that we can say it's a long one would long ones that
actually just be straight up 24 hours that would be a long one short ones are like eight hours
normal ones are 12 i mean it'll be it'll be an efap in all that you probably consider that
uh love you wolf also hi rags and mauler oh it just says dot dot dot mauler i'm not sure what
to make of that i'm gonna say hi hmm hello um if water is wet is fire burnt on your side rags
i don't believe so no fire isn't burning it is the thing that burns it is the isn't it the result of
something burning yeah yeah basically uh who is sex and how did my father offend them
sex you know how this works i read super chat sometimes they just don't make sense okay
i'm opposed to sex yeah yeah that's what it says who is sex and how did my father offend them i
don't know what that means father
i am i am not following what they are i i i don't know i'm sorry i don't know the context
for that and i'm sorry your father is offended by sex what can i say
just to remind people as well um i'm skipping over ones that are directly addressing wolf
we're gonna do an efap mini and i'll read them all to him got my got my notepad
i already have one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen for him i feel like that's gonna go up to at least fucking 300 before this is over
well i guess i'm clearing my schedule for the next 12 hours
12 12 more like 19 hours am i right or am i right
i believe you're correct
father is britain offended by saxons
he's more or serious you fools really guys sexual harassment i don't understand how does that work
i don't get it either well what is what serious how did my father get offended by sex
what does that got to do with sexual harassment exactly how does that work sex chat help us out
yeah someone's asked did they not get it is like no i didn't get it i have no idea what that means
let us know why well i'll keep an eye on chat but please let me know what that means
it might be some kind of meme that was in the opening of the first stream maybe but
maybe i have to tell you a lot has happened that's like a week in me time i've also i'm
finally sobering up i had a lot of vodka but that's where we're at uh the first efap i actually
get to watch live from the jump you guys have meant so much to me we'll miss you we'll stay
safe wish you the best someone said reverse someone said reverse the words all right um
wait which was father my did how and sex is who reverse the reverse the words
sex oh sex offender someone's saying sex offender but how did my father offend sex sex offend
yeah he's a sex my father is a sex offender he offended sex what's not going to do with
the sexual harassment meme from brown table no it doesn't have anything to do with sexual harassment
is chat trolling us no it's supposed to be like a like it it means sex why is my father's a sex
offender because he offended sex that's the that's the joke oh oh that was yeah okay yeah
all right there you go yeah we are we are better off as a result of that someone like
there a lot of people only one person or two in the in the in the chat was saying that most
a lot of people are still trying to figure it out someone is like maybe sex is an acronym like
we're all trying to figure it out onision groom's teenage girls chris hansen i'm about to end this
man's whole career oh my yeah pretty much high right i don't really know the thing going on with
onision uh it just seems like chris hansen's looking to discover as much as possible about
the whole situation and do some till i know that onision was knocked off patreon in the in recently
ish so getting he is what he was he was removed from the patreons why i don't actually know the
reasoning exactly um i just know that that happened uh let me see um controversial youtuber
banned from patreon after alleged doxxing onision has come under the tuts now a patreon banned the
controversial youtuber onision after he allegedly doxxed a woman who says he harassed her and
manipulated her into a sexual relationship which is uh not the first time um uh da serious said you
guys are tied as fuck at its shows so we're at 13 hours of streaming i've had the alcatisms
we're doing we're doing the best we can but we got we got we got things to read out so that's
what we're doing we got this uh where's the onision one uh lots of wolf ones
so tonald is one of the brood now with his stallwars video great hearing him trash tlj
gonna miss you wolf glad to be free of social media tism but yes uh tonald does not like tlj
it was quite a surprise to hear but pretty cool yes he took some shots of the prequels but
ultimately he seems to think that the sequel trilogy or especially tlj is the worst so
i don't know i don't know what else to say other than um welcome to the brood especially after his
his new video we were downright impressed that was that was legit impressive he did a good job
oi mauley why did i see you praising ben kingsley as a toilet terrorist in iron man 3 on twitter
did i mention him on twitter also i thought that he was pretty good in iron man 3 honestly um
i'm actually really disappointed that we didn't get to see him play the role of the mandarin
because man did he seem like he was nailing it um but uh when they made him play trevor slattery
the like fake actor dude i thought he did great as that too ben kingsley's just a really good actor
um just because he's in a terrible movie does not mean he was terrible in terms of acting that's
probably what my take would be i don't remember talking about that on um twitter but if i did
that's probably what i wanted to say but i can't confirm unless i see the tweet that may be
referenced and um also hi rags hello um
hey guys i hope you have a great stream was wondering what you think about that college
teacher that uses tlj to teach his students how not to write a screenplay i say bless that man he
knows what he's doing i'd love to see an actual like uh how how like um you know like like a series
of lessons that are all like focused around maybe scenes portions or acts of the film
and just just how that like how a lesson plan might run out with that sort of thing that could
be really cool like i stand by the whole like it's a challenge for homework like to discover as
many problems with the film as you can and then like mark each other's homework or something yeah
um
oh my so the reason i'm getting slowed on this is i've just like the next six in a row are all
directed at wolf so i'm gonna i got you i got you gives me a little bit of a speed bump but i'm
getting there um
it's a shame we can't get the efap screening of episode nine a weekend at palpatine's
a weekend at palpatine's i mean palpatine's gonna be alive and well so it wouldn't quite be
the same plot as that movie i imagine unless who who would the dead person be in that scenario
probably um just star wars in general that would be the corpse but um you know the stream we're
gonna do for it instead we'll just do it'll it'll have to do and i'm sure it will like i said full
roster probably going to be the 12 hours again and all about episode nine your one-stop shop for
such things and um yes the 21st so it gives you guys a little bit of time if you really want to
um sort of see the film that's really up to you i suppose a lot of people feel that they
don't want to give any money towards it but some people do want to feel that they want to um
um have context for our coverage but we'll do our best to provide all of that as well
when did the spiders develop wigs they fly now
that fucking clip man they fly now they fly now everybody was really pissed at that
definitely didn't make any friends make any friends no like the thing
that it didn't earn them any friends that that that trailer agreed yeah no friends were made
as a result of that no friends made of course you guys start just as work starts is that good
or is that bad i think we could keep you company while you're working yeah just your friends say
hello okay
hello all my e words does that what would the east end for at that point
e words um i don't know e words and i'm entirely sure don't know internet words
oh my i haven't you know this this this theoretical mini is going to be very long
um with the with the bonus memes the the the videos we're going to have to watch out all
these things i'm going to read out but we'll be worth it uh hello me in eight hours i wonder if
that's accurate it might actually be that's probably pretty close actually yeah
it's a good way to remind yourself of things
okay uh everybody betray me i'm fed up with this warl that's a super chat a well worth while one
again i think i'm just going to say this every once in a while i'm going past a lot of ones that
are specifically directed at wolf from saving them all into a big file um make sure he gets
everything was watching southpaw's podcast and got introduced to biggittiest pupil just t f i
justify justify uh-huh also watched g force and it was still better than tlj featuring knobs
maybe um maybe g force would be a good e-fat movies because it keeps getting brought up
because of the knobs thing but we have to watch it now just because knobs is starring in it
we have to see how he performs
death star destroyers sounds like baby's first fang chick
the fan fiction what the fuck is wrong with jj i wouldn't even write that when i was 10
well he's got his opinion you've got yours but how else do you actually like
outdo the super duper super duper duper super star destroyer it's like well i have a million
little ones that's that's gonna that's outdoes it right like unironically i would have i think
there's probably an idea that ended up on the cutting room floor if you will that they all
joined together into a giant laser that could like wipe out galaxies but uh you know people
people like jj that's going too far and he's like oh man um efap is a podcast about a movie
about space wizards intended for children intended for hate mongers of the toxic brood
i'm not going to disagree with that yeah it seems reasonable honestly
remember that this podcast is for people with a sense of humor and it's all our opinion so you
can't criticize it um but we will also simultaneously talk about how someone is
stupid if they don't agree with the perspective that they hold in the video it'll make sense
um have a great efap everyone that's a nice little opening super chat i'd say
rhapsody in blue goes public domain on january 1st really that's wow that's interesting i didn't
know that that's that's fantastic though that's an excellent piece well i feel like a lot of that
there's gonna be a lot of surprising ones with that as time goes on and it's gonna be like oh
this is lee you could use this however you want now you're like oh shit
like uh mickey mouse that's in the next few years right
i bet you guys can't wait to put mickey mouse in your band fictions i think
yeah well if hmm i wonder how mickey mouse would
this is the thing that they've used mickey mouse so little now like i think by design
because they're losing the copyright unless the lawyers can fight to push that as far as possible
i don't really know um mola can't say nagar um there's also ways you can pronounce this nagar
that could be another one this is a word that's allowed in through super chance it's clearly
referencing something but um you know i disagree with the super chat i was able to pronounce that
i was i was able to say it 100 clearly with no issue um he is uh
gonna watch riser skywalker on thursday can't wait to hate it wow going in hating it already
see this is what i mean about the toxic brood is disgusting like they don't
watch movies with the intention of just enjoying it they go in hating it disgusting yeah i mean i
want it to be hilarious yeah going in like being like oh i hate it already terrible like
it's not like you've read the leaks and you know that it's going to be terrible right
that'll be ridiculous um someone said uh do a no do a beetle borgs efap mini oh my god
beetle borgs isn't something that i had i haven't heard of big bad beetle borgs in a long time
what is beetle borgs oh here let me um copy him because i remember some of the cheap
shitty toys um uh here you you recall this big bad beetle borgs no i don't think i ever saw those
or at least i don't remember them at all there were a couple like they were they're almost like
power rangers there were different iterations of them
um i remember some of the toys and stuff when i was really really young
someone made beetle borgs in soul caliber but yeah we need to do uh oh jay leno was in big bad beetle
wow why but there's oh it's sabin uh they made big bad they made beetle and they were also
so the power rangers people i think um yeah let's check out uh we need to check out beetle
borgs sometime wow that isn't beetle borgs that's not something i have heard in a long time
curse of the shadow borg
okay um thank you all for the countless hours of fun you guys have brought me i'm a truck
driver and i spend countless hours along the road listening to you guys makes the job
much easier or easier so rags wolf and mauler thank you you bet man yeah absolutely good stuff
maybe you're listening right now on the uh 13th and a half hour of this double stream
um i almost forgot merry christmas wolf you know what i'm gonna take that to be merry christmas
for all of us and it was yeah i'm gonna assume you care about us as well uh a lot of people have
accepted star wars died at round head's hands i mean it's complicated to pinpoint the death
but i think tlj would be the sort of wide shot that you would throw at it you'd be like it's around
there if you're going to pinpoint it exactly maybe even riser skywalker could be the exact
pinpoint i don't know just a second don't uh pay money for the riser skywalker pay for a different
movie ticket actually good one then sneak into riser skywalker and be prepared to laugh at the
comedy film the lovely folks over at lucas film put together i know that that's what a lot of
people are going to do so they can stay in the conversation but also uh not give disney any money
um though i think a lot of people are going to go the jack sparrow route as well naturally you'll
get your uh you'll get your porterican style shaky cam coverage i believe i think it was
er who made the joke in his like tl i couldn't just tlj or something else coverage but
he says like uh there was a part of the film he couldn't quite make out because too many people
were laughing over it or something and he was like directly on purpose referencing the cab
copy that everybody uh who didn't go to see the movie had looked at um
um
um i don't know what to make of this one worth got leaven kill to change my mind
worth leaven leaven
those are clearly people but i don't know
oh
maybe a reference to something that we're not on the up and up of
oh cube uh those are characters from cube however i haven't seen cube so i do not know
that's so have you seen cube i know of cube i saw cube two i didn't see cube one
oh there's a cube two yeah maybe we should see those you two wasn't very good
cube two was i've heard cube one is good or at least much better than first the second one
apparently it's like hypercube or something yeah let's yeah we can uh oh the second one's
called hypercube no it is called cube two but it's it's cube two hypercube well so
for instance right this is something i remember about cube two
two people have sex and then they spin in mid-air and then they age rapidly and die
oh my god that's something that i remember happening um
i i can't remember the exact context but i remember even as a young man watching it
and being like what the fuck minus i was like oh my god i'd better never have sex
yes because sex i don't want this to happen to me makes you an old
um
the only people who trust rotten tomatoes are the people whose opinions align with the critic score
yeah this thing i don't know anybody who appeals to rotten tomatoes critic scores
you know people don't typically because those folks little bit crazy when it comes to movie
movie takes um opinion about the ghostbusters afterlife trailer
it was okay it was fine it was nice and kind of subtle and it wasn't very like
like crazy over the top it had a nice sense of scale to it and i'm curious to see what they do
with it i'm curious to see how it uh how it turns out i liked the subtlety of it i think that it's
tough to think positively about it because of the fact that uh of everything else is going on in
hollywood right now in terms of just destroying ip's um i think it's got potential and uh maybe
we should try and be a little bit optimistic like this would be the one to be optimistic about i
think out of everything we're dealing with um let's see what happens with trailer two
because that eventually comes out and you know hopefully it's okay hopefully it's okay
what else can i say yeah i am cautiously optimistic but i like the trailer enough
and holy shit it's a damn sight better than 2016
um the file size for a figure in the advent calendar is 80 to 90 kilobytes except for j
whose file comes at a whopping 313 kilobytes therefore j is a massive what is what's wow
what's up with that did you does he have is he on a rhino or something i don't think so i think
maybe there's just some preference there i don't know kyberkins may really like j you know he just
might um this one just says i have a sense of humor i think this is in relation to the you need
to have a sense of humor to watch the video if you remember oh yeah you know it's good we split
those streams up because that one's going to be available for me to repost it like almost
immediately after we're done with this stream so people can see at least the first half straight
away oh yeah that is good that's processing uh rags rapidly reposts retarded roast rebuttals
amen yeah i don't think we can disagree with that nice one uh
uh
ray should have been a conduit that anakin used anakin would lend his natural ability in the force
and his learned skills to nerd to one individual this explains ray's power and allows anakin to
stay important how does that work ray should have been a conduit that anakin used like as in like
used as a force ghost like maybe he could possess her i don't know
i don't know what he means so ray should have been a so maybe if darth vader was coming back
as anakin he would be good he uses
me oh if anakin wanted to remain a part of the trilogy this would give a yeah this is
i guess like an explanation for how um it would be a better explanation for why she's so good
yeah i don't i'm not sure i really like that like that because the idea of him just being able to
give all of his skills and talent to somebody right that sort of opens up some options there
too for other people to be doing that yeah which complicates everything i just i don't know i'm
crazy thought i just want people to stay dead just stay dead anakin had a great series of
movies from one to six just stayed dead even though i'm pretty sure he is definitely staying
dead not coming back in these movies which by the way shocking honestly i still think that i'm
surprised overall that they didn't bring back vader that seems like the thing they would do
vader is yeah the most popular villain of all time in culture so why not just bring him back
bring him back palpatine you know these fuckers don't have any shame at all exactly so why not
do it maybe they'll bring him back in episode 10 oh episode 10 jeez when will that happen yeah
yeah maula mechanizes model massives meanwhile menacingly messages ma rei su
why would i message ray massages ray oh my goodness menacingly massages i'm curious
exactly what that entails how would you interpret a menacing massage ranks a menacing massage
oh strangulation oh so we're just like digging into people would i strangle ray do you think
that that's the case no i i wouldn't strangle ray what about me would i do it well or maybe
like a creek no i wouldn't strangle you no no what i strangle ray oh no no no no you wouldn't
strangle ray i mean she kind of ruined everything though she's just i mean yeah i wouldn't don't
kill her not like i don't know all right ray we're gonna spare you you can you know be happy
yay good morning i've always loved listening to your podcast you'll legit my favorite maula
oh very kind uh listening to this while cleaning toilets at work
oh as long as you got some company in your ear that could probably pass the time a little bit
quicker i suppose um i'm glad you respond to this shitty video i watched it and hoped you'll react
to it because there's a lot of bruh moments in there like i said man this one more so than any
other video in the history of efab was sold to me as the video to convince a person that tlj has
quality in it yeah this is really not a not good i was just talking the most we'd heard most of it
before was expecting more um this one says i mean it says carrot something and then a ugh i wonder
if it's like foreshadowing for the carrot being cooked bad thing i don't know i'm gonna i'm gonna
choose to believe that it was foreshadowing this next one says test what do you think that could
possibly mean well maybe they were trying to see if test was a banned word by goog let me give it time
um also all the super chats i sent with the rep rep repetitive letter thing please send the
money to whom i addressed in them so ten dollars for all of you massives absolutely uh the balrog
was a tennis ball on a string during production man lord of the rings was such a silly movie oh
i know right fucking silly ass movies those fantasy films so silly
shouldn't hope to recreate those because they're just this silly
i don't even i can't even tell you what the fuck his point was with that silly
uh
hi massives haven't had time to chat uh to catch up with all the chaos over the year because i was
recently joined uh joined the marines here's a small pledge been efapping since its conception
the genesis if you will uh yeah i mean i'm really glad man oh um what about a sex strangle chat
asks you can force heal her if she cry if she cries oh my god well you bring people back from
the dead oh no please she can though well you know there'll be more questions questions shall arise
um guys thoughts on the harry potter movies
they're fine i guess no fine uh you need to talk to harry potter fans because i i just i was never
that into them um i but but like i thought the actors did a good job i thought it made sense for
the most part but i'd have to watch them all again and i just don't even really care to because i
just don't care about harry potter that much unfortunately um i remember doing bad plot
summaries with my friends we always started with remember that time when and everyone else had to
guess what it is yeah i think there's a lot of those that are like custom made that you can sort
of try and guess but they're a great way to understand that you can make any movie sound retarded
and i hate the idea that star wars is just so silly look at how silly that there's a guy in a
robot suit guy in a dog costume who's not even wearing pants how silly i'm not wearing pants
i'm not a dog costume though advice on starting a movie review youtube channel
what do you got rex oh try to well i don't know about specifically movie reviews but try to do
something everybody's doing give people a reason to come to you um people only have so much time
so if they can only watch a certain amount of videos give them a reason to choose yours over
anyone else have something about your personality or the way that you look at information and
assess things and analyze info to make them want to get your take uh or make it entertaining if you
can yeah and then for me i just be like stick to what you're passionate about to keep yourself
going and do your best to stay as accurate and structured as you can and i know that a lot of
people seem to think that my videos the people who don't like me are like oh so unstructured
just funny you can ask metal it's been helping him re-script his uh john wick video the amount
of structuring that goes into script writing and redrafting on my end like i guess i'll have to
review one of my own videos one day to try and point out how much structuring there is but it's
it's good for you and um you eventually kind of have to learn your own video sometimes if you
want to do like a really big important breakdown that's that does the job and you don't have to
return to it um you gotta learn it as almost like a fiction you're like oh i started with this i
mentioned this before i don't want to repeat this point i'll move this point to this section
or to make this more poignant i'm gonna talk about it here instead of there like that sort of thing
i feel like uh a lot of the stuff we usually say is just be detailed accurate
passionate lots of the sort of standard pieces of advice but they really are good
for getting you uh on the way um even the quote good artists copy great artist steel
quoted by steve jobs from picasso is stolen from previous people
good artists copy great artists steel yeah i don't know about that yeah you'd have to sort of
go really far into what exactly you mean like again about the whole the line between
being influenced and creating something new versus just outright copying and pasting like
it's complicated um
jay has really outdone himself these last dozen efaps a job well done mr manager
majority shareholder now kick jay along with wolf hi wags hello i mean yeah we can kick jay
we we did already you must have found this out of satisfying he was kicked twice actually
so not bad done a good job today i think most would agree um i think he did good
this notepad is getting very very very large oh my god do do do
started playing as zabrak in star wars dnd darth moles race called mal craxis do you guys have a
favorite race the white um let me see a favorite race in star wars i don't know um
um if i was gonna be besides human let's say non-human race um uh star wars races
all right uh
star wars alien races i got a list i'll go through some here all right
um i'd want to be a claudite those are changelings oh like uh zam in the second movie
zam's a claudite i would definitely want to be a be one of those um um
um so far i'm just going down a big list here those are looking like uh they're gonna be the
ones i mean it's a pretty strong choice i wonder what uh pretty incredible ability and we're all
we're assuming humans off the table i guess yeah a non-human boathans aren't too bad
many boathans died to get that information um
trandoshans can i think they could regrow limbs
they have like really big regenerate they have very super powerful regenerative capabilities
um let's see obviously ewoks uh but
do do do um zabrak is what mall is
yeah probably the claudites i'm willing to agree with that anyone can find something
from literature and mythology from star wars is a documentary called star wars the legacy reveal
that did that yeah he was he was upset that apparently the critics are not talking about
the mythology those pesky bastards um along with terminator resistance keep an ear out for the fan
game tech comm 29 20 29 uh marx reviews has an exclusive playthrough of their unreleased demo
all right hmm uh currently uh banned from discord because i argue that sports are fake and gay
vet your mods mast man also hi doggy uh hello like i said i'm assuming it's probably more than
just saying sports are fake and gay but i mean sports are real and gay i'll have you know yeah
i think that's fair um
oi mauli mind playing your tlj critique part two at 1 22 50 for a minute or so it would definitely
seem appropriate for our current time um i guess i'm curious now enough to be like what is
what is this reference it must be in relation to the video 1 2 2 50
instead it was nothing ray's power is her own and we will likely know nothing about
her appearance now or how they inform her character which is all we had because of how
much of a blank slate she was the defense for this is that it's subversive content as you are also
readily aware of so let's do this what is the purpose of subversive content exactly oh i don't
want to play this whole section but uh yeah i said i i say it's likely we won't even find out what uh
how exactly her powers came to be now but apparently we will because she's palpatine's
uh granddaughter yeah turns out she's palpatine's granddaughter it makes sense if you think about it
oh yeah i'm curious how much they're gonna bother trying to explain that
they're just gonna be like i don't know she they'll throw a couple flashbacks and whatever
it's gonna be so crazy walking into the theater being like this is it here we go who knows what
we're about to see really we've read the leaks but honestly you know yeah i'd be curious not
if the leaks are accurate but how much they're accurate really
someone they said it was exclusively and specifically because i said fake and gay
the mods even so well if that's the case then i think they fucked up in their moderation and
i think that they should reverse it um but that's if that's the case if that's the case i think
that's a ridiculous reason to get banned from the server and obviously they should um undo that
and you could clip that shit and send it their way assuming that was why you got banned
yeah like i said i get i'm not a mod um well for one i can't do anything about more decisions on
the disco because it's i just don't uh involve myself enough in the admin decisions to be able
to be like i overrule everything here but i seriously doubt because i do know them pretty
well i've known them for like five years some of them now seriously doubt so they would ban you
just for saying fake and gay it doesn't seem like them but you know if they did yeah maybe
that sounds fake and gay on its own um uh didn't jj say i'll do what i want in regards to episode
nine yes he said fuck it in like an article so i think that's what we're getting um according to
the terminator fans paramount may have purposefully wanted dark fate to fail so they can push their
version of john connor with chris pratt in the upcoming film the tomorrow war amazing uh
the tomorrow war i don't know um that's one of the dude man is drafted to fight no war
where the fate of human ability to confront his past um
let's hope it's good shit
i mean i as far as i can tell you didn't the director of dark fate say he doesn't know why
it failed he was like i don't know it seemed like it was pretty good uh wags is quap by wags also
hi wags hello and i'm not quap i'm amazing i'm equitable proof that empire would be well received
by fans infinity war the hero's lost in the end yet people regard both films as high quality
entertainment yeah that argument was terrible and it kind of reflects how stupid his argument
was later about the titanic that that shit did the titanic ed with the iceberg hit no the why
would tlj ed like that idiot it hits the brain uh braintism as they say uh-huh uh cz fab during
a reaction to tlj apologia this is where the fun begins oh yes fun is not gonna say it's definitive
being you know yeah uh first super chat uh gonna miss you all if you and the efap gang made my
days a little bit brighter and i'm thankful for that i'm gonna head out and watch the whole thing
later also hi wags hello pretty much the answer to all these terrible arguments is if tlj is so
great then why do other films need to be made worse to prove it also by wolf um yeah there's
a common practice for a tlj apologist they will constantly reference just how bad the ot is
the ot is just as terrible guys the ot is uh uh guilty of doing the things that you don't like
the sequels do bad bad bad um this video changes minds about tlj before watching it they liked it
still now they are one of us uh yeah like i said i'm curious uh because like i said a lot of people
on twitter and on discord had sent different messages including that they were convinced by
i don't know if they'll feel we were either unfair or that we offered a different perspective that
changed their position on uh the film uh video sorry so i don't know like i said a lot of people
found it convincing i don't know why weird yeah i don't know why um
i'm doing a lot of copy and pasting i'm starting to think that maybe maybe i should um we could do
another catch-up stream what i can basically like my what i'm thinking in my head right now
because i can pull up two notepads and basically go through the entire backlog and just sort into
wolf ones and then me and you ones and then do a stream with you and just go straight through a
list of me and you ones hmm because uh there's just a lot of delays right now
where are we at we're at seven and a half hours we've got like i said uh we were intending to
do a stream on tuesday so we could just do a uber chat catch-up on tuesday how about that
yeah
how much time do we have left oh we got quite a bit it's just oh good
uh like i said it's just lots of dead air because i have to sort through super chats
i don't know if that means that we should uh refocus or or whatever
what do you think
like to keep going and go for it well i'm suggesting that uh say for example if i
stop stream right now and then uh sorted through this entire selection of super chats into
ones for wolf or when we do the the mini and then ones for us and then come tuesday uh you and i can
do just a super chat catch-up stream and i can just go through a notepad filled with all the ones
that are directed at us and then we'd be caught up ready for the 21st well it might not be a bad idea
because we've this stream was started like what seven hours ago yeah this stream not including
the last one was about the same so we got like what 13 14 hours of streaming today
yeah i will i will say i am a little bit biased in the department of
i i'm feeling slightly hollow in terms of energy yeah i'm starting to get there too
i don't want to waste people's time in terms of just like lots of silence until i get the
right things out instead of what you can have instead is a focused selection of hours of me
and rags just smashing through all the questions yeah and plus we'd have a lot more energy
such and yeah but none of them will be missed like i said i have been collecting all of the
wolf ones it's huge um i'm going to read all of these out to him he's got no choice
but uh yeah i don't know it just seems more pragmatic right now and um
by the time we even get through a decent chunk of these
more will come in so instead i can just sort them all offline and um yeah it might be the best idea
we can tackle the super chats with more you know energy and umph and all that we have been going
for like 14 hours now uh the majority of the day was spent streaming already yeah and holy shit
were they some epic streams yeah these were these were good we hit we did a good pair
he faps 64 and five with some good tisms good rat if you will um i'm so glad we've
gone through so many memes as well because i can stop logging so many um and some of
some of those memes guys were were really good oh yeah like some of those are really still fresh
those those were good stuff um yeah not not looking to disappoint uh i will get working on
all of this to make sure it's separated up and we we we can nail it like i said on tuesday me and
rax will probably do a stream where we just do what we did last time get a full catch-up done
as for when we'll do the one with wolf uh he's going on i think i believe some kind of trip with
his family very soon and he won't be back until late december so it'll be january that we're
probably going to be able to do what will be the copyrighted meme videos and like i said we could
do that slightly earlier but we're going to want wolf to see him as well so i think most people
who've made those meme videos will be happily happy to wait uh along with extra memes and and
all the super chats that are meant for for wolf though i would say that like past this stream
if you could not send any more super chats for wolf because holy fuck it's going to be really
difficult for me to read all of these to him in one sort of go um i've only i've only gotten
like i've got a shit ton and that's what like 10 percent so i'm gonna get them all sorted um
but yeah i think i think we're gonna wrap up there um because otherwise we will accidentally
do a 24-hour stream which is the um the consume we will always have i'm sure we'll never actually
get there and then once we get to episode 100 i'll have to do a 50-hour stream or something but
um it's been kind of crazy we did tonal's good video tonal doing guitar a tlj video that went
through almost like a cavalcade of all the arguments we've tackled over the two years
all in one video it's been wonderful in its own way then all those meme videos loads of throwbacks
um and all the meme meme images loads of art all the very generous donations a bunch of cameos
from uh efap alumni as well as lots of interactions with wolf and and a debate between remarkable
republican and shadow diversity who could have seen that come in wow a blessing truly a blessing
it's a it's a christmas miracle and yeah there you go we had zero christmas efap streams and now
we got two i will yay so as soon as we go offline i'm going to start posting all the memes we covered
into the into the discord and i'll get the moolah version of the first half of the stream done as
soon as i can um thank you all for hanging out with us like i said we'll come back on tuesday
to do a super chat catch-up and then um yeah it'll be is it saturday is the plan for
yeah next saturday efap 66 where we will be talking about riser skywalker because that's
where we're at execute we've fap 66 we've come full circle guys yes um anything else you want
to say before we sign off it's just hard to believe that tlj is what brought us together
and it's finally time for the next star wars movie to be out because solo doesn't fucking count
do people still remember that movie happened i don't remember that there was a han solo movie
it was really good um it was great but yeah thank you for everything folks and uh we will see you
tuesday mm-hmm have a good one goodbye
