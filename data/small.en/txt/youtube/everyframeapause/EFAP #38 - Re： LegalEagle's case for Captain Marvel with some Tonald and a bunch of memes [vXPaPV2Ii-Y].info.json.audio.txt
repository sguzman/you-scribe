You forgot that we all have to say the pledge of allegiance to America. I don't
live in your stupid country. I pledge allegiance to the Queen because she has
superpowers. What is her suit what are her superpowers? If I told you they
wouldn't be superpowers. They sound like superpowers if I don't not unknow. You
know. How can you unsuper power? She's not dead is she? She could just keep
getting older. That's his superpower. That's true. She hasn't died like the
other person who died. Unfortunately she eventually becomes like a just a pile of
dust but she's still alive. Putting it in a little jar and there's a speaker on
the window and every time they're like Queen what do we do and she's like I
don't fucking. It's not even a voice just. Her soul wailing from the beyond. They can't
kill it like they want to. We can't possibly separate her into any smaller pieces.
The atomizer. She's still alive. I'm the spirit of England. And so she still has the
crown. There's just no way that abdicates or anything. And then one day in the
future we'll make a robot body and put the jar on top of the body so that it
could just walk around and whenever someone's like hello Queen she'll be
like she's kind of a horrifying monster. The body has to be like really huge like
maybe we can just give her a terminator body so then she can just kill everybody.
Don't you think it's time for the next queen? I will never be another next queen. I am the
queen of turtle. Genuinely how old is this witch? 172.6. In metric or imperial? 93. Jesus
Christ. Yeah she'll be dead. She's got a few decades left in the old trunk. How old
is Betty White? OK so we can't say that they're the same person then. I don't know. Yeah I
guess the title is confusing if you're an idiot but it says season 3 finale. I've decided
this is the end of season 3 of efap because this is the end of season 3. Yeah this is
the last episode of season 3 because season 1 is 10 episodes. We didn't even have a villain
this time. No we did we did. I looked back and I was like I can see a thread here. I
can see especially considering special information but yeah so season 1 is 10
episodes. Season 2 is 14 episodes and then season 3 is no wait season 2 is 12
episodes and season 3 was 16 episodes so we're getting more episodes every time
our producers are really happy with the show apparently. Yeah they gave us as much time as we wanted that's
great. Yeah really it was the villain. I believe it was Captain Marvel. Oh because of the Don. I covered it
early on and that only awoke the monster. We've covered it several times in the
episodes and she attacked Don. Like I don't know if there's any possibility for another villain. You
know I was in that scene that article that's going around the one about how youtubers are
angry. I saw I saw his his response to it. I tried to watch his response but he
sounded so dead inside that whole time. Wait even a video response? Oh I saw his tweets. I didn't I didn't even know he did a video response to it.
Well it was released like a day or two ago. Oh my goodness. I haven't even seen it. We've
got so many things to do already. Oh my goodness. I just wrote down low thrusts. How long is it?
That would don't that total. That would. Downward total. That was thrusts. I love it. Okay the real reason why negative. Oh yeah yeah right right.
Oh that's related to the article then. I didn't know that was actually I thought that was just. Yeah that's that's the first thing he brings up. Like he's like I threw out my
script because I tried to do it four times. I was like oh donald what are you trying to
do it. Someone someone called dad old look so that we can inspire some I don't know energy into tonal. I mean
we got so much to do today if we can fit that into it I can only hope but um we have to we have to cover
tonal we got so many hold the line so many tisms are on the agenda but we'll get through
rags you saw Godzilla right yeah what did you think I did I saw Godzilla on the yes hold on hold on
before we start this because apparently there is confusion from something that mauler literally
didn't say in the last dream which is that I didn't like Godzilla king of the monsters
even though that's not what mauler said and I haven't watched the movie some people came
away from whatever it was you said thinking that I was saying that the 1998 Godzilla movie is better
than this one which I said you said it's more than likely that it is after how I described
king of monsters to you okay no no I told you that I had seen it when I was a kid and my memory
of it is I was entertained by it but I legitimately haven't even seen king of the monsters so
no I I haven't I don't think that to the people who for some reason think I think that I haven't
watched it and I don't plan on it yeah and all I said was that I'm very certain in our conversation
you said that by the sounds of king of monsters the 98 vision might actually have better writing
well yeah I mean you made it sound like it was retarded but rags what do you think what did you
think it was retarded I thought this new Godzilla yeah everything that wasn't monster fights was
retarded and rags did you know that that means it's a good Godzilla film oh no it's just terrible
I've got I got five arguments that I picked out from from the discord from Twitter from
I'm not touching this shit when I'm 10 foot full this is this is a like for once for once the
chat's gonna hate you guys instead of me and I'm gonna bask in that I don't understand we have to
be consistent I'm not gonna break with everything that I feel about movies well in that case right
I haven't watched the movie so I literally can't make I will I will give these arguments to rags
since he's apparently saying that the uh the the the film isn't very well written these are
counter arguments to our claims that it's poorly written by the way that not not arguments for why
the film is bad the first one was so these are arguments saying that it wasn't poorly written
not necessarily their responses to the idea that the film is poorly written so uh
all right here we go you ready for this first one Rags
I'm gonna assume that's yes yeah sure um why are you looking for a story in Godzilla that's
like looking for a story in porn or football are this porn or football all right oh my god I feel
like I can argue against this but I'm just not going to which of these things am I gonna say
first all right let's let's start with porn all right let's start with porn let's say right
you're gonna go and watch a porn movie no one gives a shit about the plot in porn that doesn't
mean the plot's good plot's terrible the porn would be better if they were characters that I
cared about if they were written well like that would actually make the porn better the point
actually said that's a little better yeah if the if these were characters that I cared about in a
relationship that I had investment in then I would absolutely enjoy the sex way more
I agree these people never have so question have these people never had sex with people
that they've really cared about because it's so much never played Mass Effect
they've never been an actual like relation this is how real world stuff works
when you're invested in the other person the sex is better
okay so what about football
what about football is football a story is football a story I don't really yeah I don't
get it well so the the counter I imagine would be like yep you don't need a story in porn for porn
to have his function that's the same for Godzilla yeah you don't need yeah I wish there wasn't a
story in this Godzilla movie I wish it was literally just Godzilla fighting monsters they
could have saved me time I could have gotten out of the movie theater faster I agree with that
got back to more to hell I would have legitimately the movie would have been better if it was just
oh no Godzilla's fighting the monsters and it was just that there was this weird misconception that
I thought that there needed to be more human element to the film I never said this um I think
there's way too much human shit in the movie but I wouldn't have minded if it was really well
written human shit yeah there was way too much human shit absolutely there was way too much
human shit oh did you laugh at any of the jokes oh god some of the cringy I didn't I told wolf
about one of them where he says something like vaguely profound or whatever and the guy's like
did you just make that up he's like I read it in a fortune cookie and there's like a silence
for laughter and he was just dead oh yeah nobody in my theater laughed at any of the jokes they
were terrible the jokes were terrible and the thing is if you're gonna lord knows what the
budget was for this and how much they spent on marketing the tens of millions of dollars they
spent on making this movie yeah and it just goes show that I guess none of the budget went to
writing or story or characters I didn't even think the acting was very good you know margin
Steinpets just said football matches could be very exciting when there's an actual story behind it
like the underdog beating the big teams almost recently so like think about movies that are
about sports where they have like a team we are martial um like the mighty ducks I was just
thinking like yeah so the story would kind of improve it like I don't know there's a water boy
get it to the point where the Godzilla movie has amazing writing and monster fights and man
I'll be praising it instead of saying yeah I enjoyed the monster fights for the right
shit and then people yeah I'm not just gonna I should just go to the next one crap the next one
was all that crap was still part of the movie why are you complaining about the story in a Godzilla
movie nobody watches Godzilla for the story well that's weird because when I paid the movie for
the ticket and I walked into that theater there was a lot of that shit on the screen and I had to
sit through a lot of that garbage to get through the good to get to the good parts so I would have
much preferred that the parts I had to suffer through were good instead yeah at that point I'd
just be like if nobody's watching Godzilla for the story then why is there a story in there
yeah like do they feel like they have to have one do they feel like this is something that's
necessary are they just trying to put stars in the movie in order to get us to watch it
I mean you have to sit through a lot of stupid human crap to get to the cool monster bits
what if the stupid human stuff was actually really good and you really wanted to hear the
characters talk because the lines were great and you cared when buildings around them
that'll be cool I just like what like we can't just excuse bad writing because it's in a monster
movie now remember the woman who advocated for the genocide of planet earth was in trouble at the end
after she made his weird sacrifice did you care about her life that I was just like fuck no I
didn't care about anybody I hope Kinga Nora eats you please go for it go for it I I'm still I was
talking on the ride back home from the theater because my dad wanted to see it so he wants to
go see it yesterday and in the car ride back I'm like so I think her name was Emma the the mom main
character I was like so I was like kind of baffled for half this film trying to figure out what they
were going for with her because I was just so confused I was trying to figure out why they had
her do the things that they did and I thought at the end they were going to be like ha ha she was
lying the whole time but no they didn't like I was legitimately absolutely baffled by the decisions
that were made by these characters and they took me out of the film because I'm like why why are
they doing this this doesn't make any sense where she's like oh no like I need to do x y and z to
save blah blah blah because like my daughter's control and Charles dance like and ironically I
don't even know if this was in the script or if he was just on set saying this he was like look
you hired us to basically end the world and the world is ending and now you're saying stop I don't
I don't get it he was like confused but Charles dance is pointing out plot holes in the script
well Charles dance was first off he was not in the movie nearly long enough he didn't have enough
lines but they gave all these shitty fucking minutes to the dad character these good characters
to the the white-haired nerdy conspiracy theorist guy and the useless asian bitch and the other
fucking dude is that all of these people that they tried to make us care about they gave all
these lines to and they had charles dance over here who would show up for a scene do one line
maybe and then he'd be gone was he better or worse than he was in dracula untold where's
in dracula untold he got to do more shit yeah he had more lines in dracula untold like that
one scene in the cave yeah he probably does yeah um he had a more significant role in dracula untold
he only had like one taiwan moment the game thing it was like a tiny little tiny little moment
and it was just so like oh i could see where he's generated they had good lines for him
and there's like a tiny little moment where he was just good if that was it argument three uh
godzilla isn't supposed to have a good story why is it not supposed to i want you to i want you
to back up the claim that godzilla is not supposed to this is about ballsters fighting rags
you are making a positive claim that i want to see evidence for because godzilla doesn't need a
story let's say that that's correct let's give them the incredible benefit of the doubt and say
that godzilla is not supposed to have a good story um fuck that shit how about instead it has
a good story well isn't it better to have a good story than a bad one oh there you go uh super chat
just came in with a counter i have to disagree more than most godzilla fans go to see these
movies because they see it as a monster mma fight as long as the action's interesting they
ignore the human parts even in the older movies no my dad it would be monster fights it's not and
he said he'd like the monster fights but it was a struggle to get to the again i'd say this is
someone who hasn't seen this movie but mauler what did you say was like even less than a third
of the movie is dedicated to the monster fight yeah and they were the best bits they were so good
one thing if it was all just like two hours of monster fights but i mean if there's a huge
chunk of it dedicated to really terrible human shit then how can you ignore that other than just
like waiting for the clips to come out do you remember the vast majority of the movie is shitty
going all the way back to i believe efap episode two when everyone's talking about how plot holes
don't matter at all in the video we were covering and we we come to a conclusion we just go why not
not have them and in the same vein why not have a good story in your godzilla movie why do you
have to keep saying no one cares about it it's like i never said anyone didn't care about this movie
i just said the writing was really bad it's like yeah well don't care about it it's like okay
look i can get behind an action movie where i don't think about anything like john wick
three i saw that on vacation i have literally no investment in the plot to put it into perspective
i completely forgot why people were even chasing him at the beginning of the movie
so i don't even really remember a lot of john wick too in the first place but i was like hey
he shoots people and that knife fight at the beginning of the movie was cool and that was
my whole investment in the film um the problem by the way is this wouldn't even be discussed if not
for the fact that we seem to have found some weird impasse with the a lot of people about this because
i don't really care about godzilla and i don't know if rags is a long-term fan or anything of the
godzilla movies we're literally just looking at it as a story and then people like nobody watches
it for that and i'm like um okay so when people say that nobody watches star wars for the story
and they just like to see the lightsabers jedi and all that shit it's like do you have a response to
that because you understand if one person says yeah i like a story in godzilla um your argument
i mean your argument doesn't work anyway because we're just judging it as a story
which it is it is a story like i hate to break it to you it is a story there's characters there's
a plot there's a start middle and end there's characters and plots and motivations like they
clearly i didn't say anyone cared about it all these things i didn't say anything say anyone
had to care about it or should care about or whatever i'm just saying that it's poorly written
and for the record i believe i said this i enjoyed it as a whole because of the monster shit i really
liked uh kid gedora i don't want to see him again yeah but man you gotta get through a lot of crap
find the gold um so what have the chaff mentioned it well actually first off have you made it through
all the five arguments uh we got two more do you want to go ahead with whatever because your sounds
fitment oh well so people have mentioned shin godzilla and i know you've talked to me about
yeah i've got a note for that after these two okay so um okay the fourth one is stop complaining
there's a lack of story it's a godzilla movie um i never complained about a lack of story
yeah that's definitely not we would have preferred there was no story
yes i would rather have no story than a bad one um yeah and it would be tough to string together
but i think even even if you had two hours of monsters fighting each other you'd probably still
have some form of a simplistic story and then like godzilla's walking around the earth killing all
i think it would have been way higher rated too yeah i think the movie would have made a lot more
money and i think people the critics would be like oh hell yeah it's just two hours to freaking
awesome monster fights and the final argument was you don't understand godzilla and help me
understand godzilla well the fucking response is that fans don't want a good story of godzilla so
so really there's no i mean if you need that comment you should be ashamed of yourself okay
so let me ask a question if there's not really supposed to be a story or a good story at least
in godzilla how can you possibly not understand it it's a giant lizard that shoots lasers out
of its mouth it's like it's like a story for stupid people like anyone can like grasp that
yeah and i i just think how could you not understand it was not to understand exactly
all three of us rated mission impossible fall out super fucking high and it's like it wasn't just
because if someone said nobody watches mission impossible for the story i'd be like the story
certainly fucking helped it because the action was fantastic but caring about the characters
and understanding the stakes in the plot like oh good stuff that's that makes the movie way better
and i like that i like that in a godzilla movie sure but like i told them i already
enjoyed the movie i just don't know why we wasted so much time with humans and how poorly written
everyone again they spend so much time and they try so fucking hard to make us care about these
characters like they put there is clearly a huge section most of this movie don't let it be
misunderstood most of this movie is about the humans this is a human people movie also there's
monsters but this is definitely about human people dealing with shit and they try really really hard
to make you give it to him and then that's what they're trying that's what they're going for here
and it fails miserably i watched shin godzilla with alex and ironically it's much tighter in
terms of the writing but it's pretty like boring on the human side of it because it's very procedural
it's like godzilla is here we should do something about godzilla and some of the guys like how do
you even know that's a creature how do you know it's not just a broken pipe or something like i
don't know and it's like a good 20 minutes of that until they're like okay now we attack it and then
they bomb it it doesn't work and he nukes the whole city and then they eventually come up with
a different plan it's it's better than king of the monsters okay absolutely um the effects aren't as
good which i think is gonna happen obviously because it's against like the fucking super
high paid hollywood shit it's like i said when i showed you that picture of uh that screenshot
from shin godzilla like the dude in the suit looks like squidward did when he ate too many
crabby patties and they all went through his hips yeah i look at that picture and i just laughed
too hard and i was like yeah i'm not watching this movie i i kind of liked how they defeated
godzilla and shin godzilla and um yeah uh there was a lot of human busy bodying in that too which
was kind of it's funny how much i feel like i am actually on the side of the godzilla fans i just
yeah the the difference between these two is one of them had a really complicated story with loads
of characters that was all horribly written the other one had like barely any characters and all
of it was relatively tightly written it was just dull as fuck and i liked the monster fight and both
of them to a degree different degrees yeah that's and again i'm not a godzilla expert and i feel
like whenever i'm mentioning godzilla i'm walking into a hornet's nest of fans i'm like i didn't
realize that godzilla was so passionately beloved and that's fine yeah i didn't realize that people
love this monster so much that they were willing to just sit through so much crap and garbage to
defend it i mean i didn't realize that godzilla had an unironic fan base before this movie and i
was like oh if it's okay controversial to say that i'll say it anyway i think clover field is
better than any of the godzilla movies i've seen i know this is going to be controversial to say
but of the few godzilla movies i have seen it's like transformers but with not as bad of humor
i would rather watch the 98 godzilla unironically we're going to do that free fap movies i think
because i need to see that again anyway i i would actually literally totally seriously
watch the 98 matthew broderick godzilla then watch godzilla king of the monsters again
there you go we've upset chat all i remember from the 19 better i just want a raptor scene
and they defeated them in the stadium yeah yeah because i i mean i was like 10 years
old when i last watched that so i was like this is fun it's probably so bad it's good
godzilla 19 it has uh it has leon in it leon the professional dog um yeah so um moving on
no no no it's like you realize that like i'm saying that because the human shit in the 98
version is so bad that it's great like it's terrible but the stuff in godzilla king of
the monsters is absolutely awful like it is the most boring dull inconsequential nonsensical
crap ever and i've already seen the monster fights so it's not going to be like oh wow
it's the same thing yeah they're good but fucking hell i like the monster fight i like
the like i'm not gonna sit through like godzilla king of the monsters is monarch and humans also
monsters like they call it godzilla but that's almost false advertising so i should just wait
to see the fighting scenes on youtube and like three i would absolutely recommend that
get a bit 4k that'd be great um oh dark phoenix tonight though i can't wait to laugh
well we'll jump into that one quickly next i'm just gonna say uh someone's asked if we've seen
chenobyl i've seen episode one and so as well if we're gonna watch the rest of it relatively soon
i think so fucking good but the first episode was very good i heard it was based off of real life
events yes i've heard that um all right so yeah uh dark phoenix i'm still the only one who
so i've seen it wolf's gonna see it today and rags may or may not see it in the future um might
if no one else in this world existed i would be telling the audience it was it was bad loads of
it didn't make any sense and uh certainly the plot certainly the world building some of the
character stuff i quite liked a lot of the acting was pretty good and i actually liked a lot of the
fighting as as superficial as that sounds i actually liked a lot of the interactions and
the way they did special effects but um i've had a lot of complaints about the cgi we'll have to
see about that no no x min um however i am in a world with lots of other people and so i feel
like saying like guys chill out it's not the worst thing in the world holy shit and a lot of people
are saying it's the worst x-men movie uh out of all of them and i i have to remind people that
origins wolverine apocalypse and um what are the other oh yeah the last stand those three films
are pretty fucking bad um while this one actually had a lot of character moments that i really
enjoyed uh i don't want to mention any of them though because you haven't seen it yet or review
and i don't know if you definitely will or will not but lots of tismy stuff too um origins was good
no as long as the superhero i'm sorry if you say that origins is good i got a question
like if you have permanent brain damage or something um but yeah i would have to watch
don't get me wrong but it is not a good movie we will once wolf has seen it though we'll be
able to talk through it and be like also we should we should mention uh just to clarify
because i think there's some people in the chat that are confused you meant x-men origins wolverine
not the movie the wolverine no yeah i meant the origins one the wolverine is definitely
better than origins yeah i mean it's kind of a useless movie but yeah well the thing is you're
talking about origins it's hard to be worse than origins and origins is goofy as fuck i don't i
wouldn't blame anyone for enjoying the crap out of it but holy shit oh yeah i i left i left really
really hard watching it um and yeah like there's i don't know we'll see maybe maybe my mind will
change on dark phoenix but everyone's been saying it's the worst thing ever and i was just like oh
wow i didn't i didn't think so but okay um please do unbridled rage for the last two game of thrones
episodes they're on the way gonna be really long uh yeah i i told you guys about this comment
but i wanted to read it out anyway because it was funny on the last efap we did uh so this guy
this guy said this was his original comment and then he edited it um i'm pretty sure i told you
guys about it already i think you guys have been a bit too hard on no bullshit while the video kind
of sucks his points are pretty reasonable and then it has edit never mind uh oh and the the
original ones were at best passable-ish but man wait x-men they were on the deep end once he
started saying that like vision trying to get a rock out of his face is like a transgender person
transitioning i think my brain snapped in half it's like how could you possibly unironically
such a stupid i can't even say it's a point or an argument i don't know man it's a suspicious
amount of giant midgets in the movie well we did just watch each trilogy filled with
just that suspicious amounts of midgets uh do you wanna an aldir i want to give a quick take on
on star wars jedi fallen order tisms sure i shall go uh i hope the graphics improve because
those character rough looking which i mean yeah it's it's pre-alpha oh i'll give it some benefit
that out in that respect the time stopping thing was really awesome but that was really the only
thing they did otherwise it seemed really safe it didn't seem super interesting it looked really
met to me i mean i'm hoping there's more to it but for showcasing the game and trying to be like hey
guys get excited for this there wasn't a whole lot that i haven't seen like 50 other star wars
games do yeah i felt i felt like force unleashed kind of already did loads of what that game is
doing yeah and force unleashed is a super flawed game but i mean hell look at the difference with
the force abilities the only interesting new one they showed was the stopping time otherwise it was
all just force pull and force push which was kind of kind of lame to me i'm hoping there's
more platforming stuff because that looked kind of interesting and i'm hoping the lightsaber combat
gets a bit more complicated the further goes in but otherwise it looks really like six out of
tenish and you know maybe i mean i could forgive a game with lackluster gameplay as long as it has
a good story but i i don't know just because the guy didn't like the last jedi doesn't mean that
he's a good writer himself i guess hey i'll give it a chance yeah yeah i'm hoping it's
better than what we saw because i thought it looked kind of uh kind of game that i would
probably just be told about and i'd be like yeah look kind of neat i guess but we will see it's
going to be better than the fucking battlefront games so at least we got that that's a high bar
very low bar um and yeah did you see the trailer ranks uh no i did not fair enough you don't like
star wars do you hate it nope either that star wars shit game was written by ryan johnson do you
still want to do you still want to play it there's like four other writers beside him he got
cucked really oh well we don't know the specifics for that but yeah just hoping it's yeah i mean i
mean like when i saw forest wittaker in there and like uh whatever the robot dude was i was like
why are you banking on rogue one like also sure it was the least offensive of them but that's
it's not really a great game i hope there's nobody in chat assuming i meant classic battlefront one
and two i meant i meant the new one and love oh yeah we were talking about the new ones
ones are good my parents um they moved offices so they got a new place and then as they were
cleaning out the old office they found an old uh seat my old cd of battlefront two
so i was like oh that's that's kind of nifty and it brought back so many good memories
battlefront two was amazed balls the original battlefront two i hate the fact that we have to
clarify which ones they are because ea the good ones name it the same thing just like the call
of duty game where it's like it's call of duty modern warfare even though it's supposed to be
like a reboot the great loader said efap is to godzilla as eric tax it is to star wars that is
beyond defensive beyond defensive um but yeah since we've we've got like because it's a season
finale of course that's that's why this is happening we got um funnily enough because
it's been the last two videos kind of the same thing defense for captain marvel which didn't i
don't know if it was created to be one but it certainly ended up with one um a couple of
defenses for game of thrones from a podcast that i saw that we'll find funny um a tonaled video
it's gonna be real special and then possibly another tonal video depending on what's going on
um that that clip from x-men that we're totally gonna play because how do we resist talking about
that um something from collider which if you don't you guys don't know about i know rag should know
about it because red light media did a video on it too um pretty funny but i'll give you all
the context you need for that oh i think you know what you're talking about and um and wolf getting
a name drop in a podcast that i'm looking forward to him finally seeing wait what yep he has no
idea this is what happens when you have frame of pause no um but first of all we're covering mr
legal eagle who's got a channel where he basically what wolf what the fuck you want to say go on
i didn't say anything see interrupt him for no fucking reason
god yes i'll continue jesus so yeah he has a channel where he goes over movies and he breaks
down like the legal parts of them as in what characters do and how they could be punished
all literal like fucking courtroom scenes and movies and being like they did this wrong or
they did this right which is all great i've actually seen some of his videos before and
enjoyed them his recent one was on captain marvel of all things would you believe it and of course
it's to do with not with that scene that everyone has been making the rounds on the one that funnily
enough you know got people booted from uh their videos on it also i just clicked it and nothing's
happening for me i'm hearing it oh is it playing for you guys okay that's weird
i guess i'll rewind it and i'll
rags you're in the car right yeah i am in the um
now you've seen it no wait wait wait i'm in the i'm in the watch together
yeah what the fuck is happening well i got a black screen i got nothing i see it all
you do this to me
also i don't have 15 seconds get your shit straight why would you wouldn't isn't shit
like a like a like a you know the kind of shape it is i wouldn't describe it as
traits would you what what's straight or are we discussing the shapes of objects i i'm
no just a poop apparently
okay apparently wait i can see something now this is progress
all right let me drag him back so um yeah so the he's talking number three he's talking specifically
about the clip where she attacks you've seen nothing shows um wait why is that like that
wolf don the new pfp
like i've got that we might have to switch rooms because i just showed the room uh url for some
reason my screen captures off you absolutism pretty sure yeah i was gonna say i'm pretty sure
some of you guys have done that before i don't know for sure but i'm pretty sure
wait that seems like it should be working then
what's happening when i hit the oh is it going to a different screen that could explain it
there's an extra thing i see you there we go okay i fixed it wait though like i said we'll have to
make a different room because anybody with half a brain can get in here now so and we know we
like i said we'll have to make a different room because anybody with half a brain can
get in here now so and we know that some of you out there have brains
no good respect the i have a brain i respect but i used to to show respect to the brainless
respect i love the poorly educated hooray okay oh what god damn it
need to need to need to get my thing on the screen mauler you're gonna show episode 38 we
haven't figured this out mauler you just showed everybody again yeah i mean i mean i mean i've
literally back on the fucking home page on the screen you fuck motherfucker i've got my
shortcuts screwed up because i've been sorting out all the other covers that i showed right
when they do not cut your shorts simply apply the link in the usual manner to the co-hosts
oh i will and now i what is this music video away
look it's a small delay i'm pretty sure the people of efap will get over it
the loyal i'm sure they will too this is the kind of quality entertainment
are we the gentleman of the year no i it actually triggers me that of and b are capitalized
why yeah i'm not a plane yourself because it's grammatically incorrect mauler i know you wouldn't
know we care about grammar since always and forever has there even been a single discussion
on this entire show about grammar in any way shape or form i don't think so
fucking by dabe is mube
shlit
mube's lee maltism moo boomler
oh yeah i guess we could probably man as well we ended up watching all the lord of the rings films
as a result of game of thrones isn't that great yeah we love hell deer everyone loves hell deer
see that's a joke they're not going to be able to understand for a very long time
and then someone will watch this podcast afterwards and be like oh
yeah hell deer and lots of smoking of the devil's lettuce i think it's funny that if they watch two
towers the corny makes a good if they watch the coverage of two towers they'll still be like i
don't get it they didn't even talk about hell deer really you'll get it one day folks all right here
we go thanks thanks did no shut up okay so mr legal eagle did a video talking about the legal
implications of what we saw in that amazing moment where she um what can we say where she
assaulted and battered the dawn would you not agree with that yeah she tortured him extortion
i guess you could say what would you say legally that probably comes under rags do you reckon
there's anything legally there she could get in trouble for dragon she's clean i think that she
might have a few issues i think she might want to zip her lip when she talks with the popo and lawyer
up because she's got a long court case ahead of her well could you imagine that there is a case
for her to get off scott free the lawyer who takes that case is a fucking retard oh well
it'll be interesting i guarantee you one of the biggest complaints we'll have about this because
he's a relatively like approved of channel so we're going to be in controversial territory here
is that neither of you three are lawyers so how would you know that's going to be a common case
here but i'll see what you take is anyway it'll be great keeping legal eagle in the air and helping
me look fly go to indochino for indochino ex-legal eagle i don't know what indochino does i guess
they sell some look it's the dawn look at that beautiful man look at that you didn't even care
that it's a little bit uncamped because he's like appearances aren't everything well his hair
line might not be great but he is he did take his health right his spirit line is great say that
he's like that smile wind man look at him he's so happy he's such a nice guy i want to ride him
so fucking hard same with me we can do it together we'll take turns yeah crucially he makes contact
with the map that wait why have we skipped he makes contact he can't he makes contact with
the map crucially he makes the first 16 seconds the map captain is holding pulls it down and says
something that might be interpreted as a threat he was pushing it smile for me how is that a threat
you would have to be absolutely brain dead to think that how about a smile for me is a threat
what is it what is the threat being made well can you imagine if you were like captured by i
don't know isis and put in a torture chamber some guy comes in and he's like all big and burly and
he leans down and you're like oh god is he gonna waterboard me is he gonna like cut off my head
and he's like smile how about a smile for me i was about to say what you just said no anything
with that no god no smile that's almost a command how about a smile is a question
yeah he's asking you how about a smile um oh my god i guess this is a possibly how
could you possibly make this argument this opening i'm assuming is like a preview like
a what's to come sort of thing this guy is not a particularly nice guy and he just said the don is
very nice he's extremely nice look at his smile he's not afraid to help her this is how thrilled
to get a handshake this is how i knew we had to cover this because he said the don is not a nice
guy he is so pure yeah i mean if anything saying he's not a nice guy is kind of accurate because
he's well above that like that would be a poor representation of him if you were to say he's nice
like yeah it's telling i like a chance telling someone to smile is against the Geneva convention
usually here he has invaded captain marvel this man lost his wife damn it
i like how it's become the lawyer real lawyer reacts
cartoon guy that looks just like him yeah yeah hey legal eagles really encapsulates his lack
of intelligence and i really mean that this time because there are a lot of people engaging in
quasi-legal analysis and really messing it up would you believe oh tell it tell us how she's
totally not the villain in this scenario i just bat for the women i like the idea that people are
gonna run with immediately like the most casual response you'll get is like well yeah she'd be
done for assault she'd be done for theft and possibly screwing up the road if you remember
the clip she like fucks up uh traffic for a minute but um those three things are totally real
i mean it's like the donda you're like i guess he touches her personal property i guess
he sort of invades her personal space maybe from behind the map well well maybe we'll see
those arguments he touches her map it's like a euphemism or something it's like it it's like
in captain marvel's defense the don does touch her map yeah and so i guess she's off the hook
i guess riketa law might have made a response to this a bunch of people keep referencing him
oh really who's riketa law that'd be interesting to see he he's one of the guys that's been really
covering the vicman situation like from a legal angle and oh is he like a lawyer he's got yes
all right well if he's done a response i'll have to check that out too because that's something
but um i don't see one maybe he responded somewhere else or maybe he's working but then again all of
his videos are like three hours so well either way it's trying to find it but the men who are
complaining about captain marvel again are wrong about the law i know it's uh what about the women
complaining about captain do they just not exist they just don't fucking exist the women did no
women hate this movie there are no the only just the men it's the men who ate it we made it a good
53 seconds and we're already pulling the gender card here fuck off it is the men who's complaining
though rags women i don't know a single wamans that that didn't think she was justified
except any of the ones that i've spoken to but other than them crazy but stick with me here
women need protect
about the law i know it's crazy but stick with me here by the way since we're dealing with a marvel
property as always there will be a post-credit scene at the end of this video so a little
background about captain marvel before we dive into the current ridiculous controversy that
how is it ridiculous okay i like that whenever we pause it he just looks really stupid
it's kind of like slander let's slander defamation to call him the stupid
that probably breaks 17 laws
what came out last summer it had slightly more controversy than normal because
as far as i can tell and i wasn't following this closely uh the lead superhero is a woman
and the lead actress brie larson said some semi-controversial things about racism and
sexism in hollywood i do not need a 40 year old white dude to tell me what didn't work for him no
no no one cared that the lead was a woman no one fucking cared no one gave a shit the way he
worded that he slipped that right in there if i go back yeah that did that did raise a flag for me
last summer it had slightly more controversy than normal because as far as i can tell and
i wasn't following this closely the lead superhero is a woman and the lead so he's making two points
the reason it got controversy is the lead actress is a woman and it's like whoa whoa no one cares
that it's a woman we do not give you regress this far that people just commonly accept that
it's a problem to have a female protagonist for like for other people especially when this film
kind of released alongside elita battle angel and that was fairly positively received we don't talk
about that one because that breaks the narrative idiot okay he's just right he wasn't really a
woman she was a robot so it doesn't count uh nice loop robots don't count we also any movies that
came out before this year don't count as well wonder woman alien no aliens alien three alien
resurrection prometheus no stop alien covenant no stop it yeah i know i'm not saying they're
good but people went and watched them anyway and they all had female protagonists in fairness
captain marvel was a female and that's probably why most people didn't like this film i think
he's right from a legal standpoint actress brie larson said some semi-controversial things about
racism and sexism in hollywood i do not need a 40 year old white terminator tell me what didn't
work for him about a wrinkle in time love the sash she did there as well she moved ahead didn't
work for him yeah i don't hate dudes i'm just saying i mean i don't know what you're talking
about brie larson i love that scene where reese witherspoon turned into a giant cgi lettuce monster
it was this one it's thematic i also i really loved when michael pennya was a puppet that
did absolutely nothing and just showed up for no reason i just like the idea it's a great movie
it's a theme about eating healthy and then like red lead media pointed out it's like what about
the men who really liked that movie like the four year old white men who said it was really good
what about them do they they just also that was that was really pivotal for me i never thought i
would see giant oprah in a movie behind oprah that's a there was a suspicious amount of women
in a wrinkle in time there was there were no giant midgets though i thought that was fucked
oh okay it gets a little off the hook all right fine yeah we need to be conscious of our bias
and do our part to make sure that everyone is in the room that led some people predominantly
what bias oh yeah it's like you you've already established that like we need to be conscious of
our bias like i i'm biased towards good writing you can't say midgwit you say inuit midgwit
my god
predominantly men though it's just yeah okay that led some people predominantly men to boycott the
film which appears to have had no real effect people keep typing frog in the chat i love it
when they make this argument it appears to have had no effect and it's like you realize that whatever
money it made it could have made more money that's just a fact of life if it if it makes a lot of
money it could not have made any more money no effect was like well it was successful so your
boycott didn't matter do you fucking remember i was fucking fantastic um it was the toxic brood guy
because again i'd seen that episode again recently while i've been out um he said they ran a stupid
boycott that was completely ineffective on star wars um but it damaged solos overall income and
made it seem as though star wars is no longer feasible it was like an ineffective boycott that
was successful it's like what they like to run with the whole ineffective things like sure
captain marvel made less money than it would have we already know this is true as long as one person
says they wouldn't have gone they would have gone to see it if not for what she said which there's
fucking plenty of them i think i'm pretty sure jeremy from geeks and gamers didn't they're still
not seeing this movie just because of that shit because the movie did fine when it came out last
summer fast forward to last week when the producer that i'm sure that has nothing to do with infinity
war and in-game and the marvel cinematic universe nothing to do with that at all this isn't very
and i know that it's kind of a meme to say this because i'm not assuming his channel is supposed
to be this but you're not even very objective it's like why don't you just get right into it and be
like all right let's look at the legal implications of this whole scene instead of being like men have
a problem with captain marvel like okay that's a interesting way to stop someone said uh solo only
failed because of the lackluster boycott yeah oh yeah that's right i remember that
i think that yeah that actually might be the direct quote which is fantastic so
producers of the movie released a deleted scene where captain marvel more or less beats up a guy
on a motorcycle don't forget yeah he's literally telling her to take it so that he can be free of
her extortion and her threats she's holding him hostage too by the way if we're gonna start
getting him hostage yeah and if we're gonna start getting pedantic because he's gonna with the law
she threatened to kill him because she said she would take his arm off
which uh is a good chance he would bleed out before he can get the help he needs
that's gonna essentially be treated like it's him i think i'm pretty sure legally at least
that would be treated essentially the same as a threat to his life look at him he looks so scared
like i i feel so bad for him i feel i feel terrible poor don yeah he should never be put
down like this this is just he's trying to help too that's the really the worst part
i want to give this man his own movie
i want him to be the next iron this led to a reaction on certain parts of the internet
no just the internet like the youtube section of the internet yes his head looks like a rectangle
maybe he's trying to really downplay a lot of shit he's really totally this look i mean dude
really trying to frame we covered the dude last episode who was like it's sexual harassment on
the dog's part like these people exist reaction on certain parts of the internet what do you mean
react why'd you do that with your hands marvel a villain i just see a villain oh he got references
i forgot he does this yes yes by the way fair game he's he references people so we're allowed
to respond to his video surely i don't know how he works you never know with youtube we could get
stricken down with any new person we cover because they're all weird when it comes to criticism but
yeah it's the core and full disclosure uh i worked for jeremy but i agree with him 100%
captain marvel's a fucking villain in this scene i agree too by definition she what even like
i can't believe we have to say it like as if it's a shock some called captain marvel a villain i
just see a villain i see captain marvel written as a villain here the scene's awful portrays carol
as a villain that's why they cut it carol danvers is dave kellen too charismatic endearing and
likable heroine of the film but she behaves here like you'd expect a villain to behave
apparently feminists believe that women encounter guys like this all the time and it's such a
hardship and even conservative commentator ben shapiro gave this theory a signal boost
man it is so empowering to watch a woman with superpowers physically hurt and then threaten
to break a man's hand and steal his motorcycle and jacket because he said something rude to her so
empowering empowerment why is he playing i agree with i agree with the top jew there you go why is
he playing an audio clip that is saying something different from the tweet on screen i don't know
maybe this is this could be ben chauffeur before we know maybe he did it like that but i'm assuming
this is legal legal's editing it it's heric text on zediting is going to be big box office of course
not she knows that she's not completely dumb is that like a personal attack or something the
argument as far as i can tell is as follows the deleted scene shows that a man on a motorcycle
is rude to captain marvel in a totally unprovoked attack captain marvel effectively beats the hell
out of the guy and steals his motorcycle i thought he was talking about the don at first
using her words captain marvel engages in violence and is there for the villain the problem with this
okay here we go yes i'm excited though because we're finally here's oh boy here we go violence
and is there for the villain the problem is not now that it is legally and morally incorrect
wait what time are you guys on uh i'll draw you back again three thirteen it's three instead of
using you guys on 303 now it's 310 it's 310 to legally uh can one of you guys pull it back to 305
i should it's 304 for me and wolf it's 303 for me her words captain marvel engages in violence
and is there for the villain the problem with this argument is that it is legally and morally
incorrect what morally incorrect fuck you i was thinking man if he if he if he takes this from
a purely objective this is what the law says detachment kind of position that would be one
thing but to say morally incorrect fuck you dude you're a monster in fairness can we roll it back
a bit because i thought that he was saying that like our side was saying he was morally incorrect
not his side captain marvel effectively beats the hell out of the guy and steals his motorcycle
instead of using her words captain marvel engages in violence and is there for the villain
the problem with this argument is that it is legally and morally incorrect okay never mind
he really is a monster he really is i was giving him the benefit of the doubt that i should have
jesus christ but like oh my god this is explain how it's morally correct to steal his motorcycle
after the fact i love i can't wait for that i'm already past the shock part and i'm in like
apathy land where i'm like he's not serious he is serious fuck my god this is the kind of guy
that would be on the oj simpson dream team well so this is the thing a lot of people have commented
on the video like this is like the whole the idea of like the slimy lawyer
like we've talked this is terrible uh so the uh like for anybody in chat who's unaware lawyers
have a really bad reputation in general in life because a lot of them will fight their asses off
to save horrible people because you can do that and that should be possible because law is very
the reason we have all this law shit is so that you have to prove someone is guilty because that's
very important um and if you do enough i'd love to see his uh his moral argument for why
destroying the don's life is a good idea and so if you're really give that motorcycle to someone
if you're a real good lawyer then you can get guilty like straight up guilty people there's
loads of movies about this like fucking lawyers who work their asses off to just make guilty
people look innocent loads of criminal lawyers will be paid massive amounts of money to do their
best to manipulate as much as they can with the law and we're talking about stuff like um
well he's gonna go over in this video and this is the thing like he's become the stereotype
lawyer in this video where he's defending this horrific monster as like she's morally okay you're
like what and as someone has mentioned in the chat uh he is a lawyer so his moral compass dot
dot dot like here i don't begrudge these commentators too much not to say that all lawyers
are horrible people you know but well i mean he's trying to argue in favor of captain marvel
like beating up the don for asking her to smile so apparently dick mastison is a fan of this
content is he i won't say that on a super show you mean of efap or of him yeah i don't know is
it of efap or videos i have no idea anyway kicking off her attempt at being contrarian it's just that
the evidence doesn't really support this argument and the attempts to shoehorn this movie and in
particular this deleted scene into a particular conservative narrative why does it have to be
conservative conservative i didn't realize i was conservative this is news to me conservative i
have heard like fucking hell like obviously ben shapiro is conservative but like when you say
like now when you say conservative what do you mean by that because that's that covers a really
potentially broad swath of different things depending on what you mean when you say that
it's like left and right wing like they're very kind of ambiguous they're especially nowadays
when people say stuff like conservative liberal left right i want to know what they mean by that
instead of just throwing it out there because there's nothing here there there's no aspect
about the scene that would be a conservative or liberal thing i would have thought liberals would
find it pretty the the bad you know mode here this i don't know but let's let's see if he develops
that just doesn't really work now i'll note on the side that i'm not in a habit of commenting
on this kind of popular minutia but it just so yeah maybe shouldn't i was in the process of
writing a practice exam for law students a law school hypothetical that involved a very similar
fact pattern to what is portrayed in the deleted scenes and as a second aside i'm going to go
through this clip in what some might consider excruciating detail because that well you're on
the right show for that my friend that's what you do all right legal analysis is mostly factual
analysis and so i imagine it should be legal analysis is mostly factual what else would it be
i guess you could talk about like when when when witnesses have to like explain mental damage or
how they felt about the situation i guess that wouldn't be factual i don't know also um someone
in chat mentioned um is such a thing mostly factual someone mentioned legal morality is
different from philosophical morality what's uh what is what exactly is legal morality
immorality satan's morality i don't know maybe he'll explain that
since this particular fact pattern was so close to what i was already working on i thought it would
be a great opportunity to talk about some of the legal analysis that law students and lawyers go
great every day basis but let's examine the clip all right clearly a los angeles strip mall i would
recognize that architecture or lack thereof anywhere nice scuba suit okay there he is in all
of his glory there he is there's the dawn oh see that's a really the helmet that's protected in the
shit out of him he knows what he's doing he buys these yeah because he's vulnerable he knows he's
mortal you know there's a lot riding on him surviving he has to be safe for all the kids
and you know do you think that the helmet like he puts it on his head to mask his insecurities
and he takes it off because for the first time since the death of his wife he he wasn't insecure
anymore he was brave no no no i i think that he he just knows that he wants to set a good example
for like kids especially you want to wear your helmet you want to be safe people post it all like
the in love emojis oh i can't i can't wait for today that don rides up on his motorcycle next to
me and offers to take me for a ride fucking hell i am jumping on that bike so goddamn fast
oh just the bike
i mean well one thing at a time i don't get too ahead of myself
you need a ride darling yes she does okay so clearly here captain marvel carol danvers is
reading a map of him like getting his commitment minding her own business newspapers have maps in
them do you see newspaper he's like he's she's reading a map or a newspaper
he's a lawyer maybe he's trying to be careful he's like i better not say it's one thing but
it could be another thing is reading a map or a newspaper she's minding her own business and some
guy on a motorcycle has parked his motorcycle at the strip mall and he has made an unwanted overture
not the most polite how does he know it's unwanted unwanted how at the time does he know
it's unwanted an unwanted overture so by this logic anytime you engage in conversation with
anybody in public that's an unwanted over sure and you know the idea of like someone's reading
a book and you pull it down a bit just to be like hello it's like that's an unwanted overture and if
you remember brown table's assessment was sexual harassment so i mean yeah if i was out in public
well first off i wouldn't be reading a book out in public but if i was and someone like tilted it
down i'd be irritated but i wouldn't be like you're sexually harassing me yeah i would i would just
like if someone said that to me and i wasn't interested and i just flipped the map back like
clearly showing i'm not interested and then he came up to me and pushed down the map a little bit
with his hands i would just like well actually i do that kind of a story i can relate it to
story time story time story time story time story time legs crossed so so a couple months ago
i was getting my tires rotated at oh is that what they call it yeah you're getting your tires
rotate what was his name you don't need to know that information there's a few guys
oh crew all the all the uh all the pet boys yeah it was a team effort so anyway i was getting my
tires rotated and i was waiting to to finish the tire rotation and i was reading my book
exactly and i was reading my book and were there any rubber involved any members involved
yeah sure where the rubber anyway there was this there was this old lady who looked over
and she was like do you like stephen king oh because it was a stephen king book and i was like
yeah i do and she was like my son likes stephen king too and i was like okay that's great
hideous creature well well she was an old woman so yeah in a way and in the whole time i was like
can you just shut up and let me read so but again she wasn't sexually harassing me can you imagine
if i stood up pointed at this old woman and i just screamed at the top of my lungs sexual harassment
then you hit her with the book would i have been legally in my rights to do that i believe so
well let's find out actually i don't know beat the shit out of her to do but not illegal either
and of course i guess i have to point out that captain marvel is fully within her rights to
completely ignore this gentleman oh he's just reassured us that captain marvel was is within
her rights to ignore him oh wow really i don't know if you guys knew that but uh yep i've got
i put that law degree to work yes and not engage with him in any way shape or form that is also
perfectly legal how about a smile for me huh a smile yeah i'm offering to help you at least
you could do is give me a smile okay this is the crucial act that takes place that really changes
the narrative entirely the man on the motorcycle has parked his the dawn the dawn yeah is his name
his name is the john if we're gonna be lawyers here can we please be accurate he's taken his
helmet off he stood like yeah that's what you're doing off your motorcycle he mentions as if it's
important to the the violence aspect of it it's like he's taking his helmet off if he had kept
the helmet on then captain marvel would have been way out of line because he took his help oh he acts
like the world abides by the rules of spongebob where all the bikers just wear their helmets
everywhere they go the dawn took his off dude holy fuck crazy he walked over to captain marvel
he put his hand on the map that she was whoa clearly right next to her you can see that
his army's clearly right next he's clearly right yeah that's how people talk they get next to each
other no they scream at each other from across the parking lot yeah hey how about a smile for me
did you just hear sexual harassment
they're like screaming at each other to the authorities
is sort of angled which means that the distance between captain marvel and himself must be just
a matter of inches because it's not a matter of inches a matter of inches any look first off
the distance between any two points is a matter of inches
so no i know it's you i know what you mean without being an asshole don't try and warp this
i would be like objection that's fucking retarded we could see the villain can we pull it back to
like a picture of the don not just because i want to see his amazing face but because that looks
like it's a good like two feet or something three feet yeah i'd call it nearly like two and a half
two feet yeah i mean it's definitely not just like it's not like he's in her face like an inch away
yeah she's there's plenty of space you can say for conversation distance she's at least half
extended hair arm and he's half extended his arm and they connect in the middle which means
they're a good arm's length away from each other and they connect in the middle yeah that's just
that's how did the lawyers not talk to people in the real world that's how you go up to someone
and you talk to them also the pause i've got is pretty funny have you guys got the same one
uh i see it on the screen oh we need the screen hold on oh yeah i see it i see it on the screen
i need a screenshot of that real quick
it's it's a good representation of how i feel about his movie
okay i got it beautiful on the map that she was holding and is clearly right next to her you can
see that his arm is sort of angled which means that the distance between just reminds me of if
i was sitting across from somebody talking to someone someone analyzed it and they were like
he's you have to agree he has come here today he came he came to the table quite quickly he sat
down in a fast way straight edged he faced the person and you're like what are you saying all
of this for what does this add to like why do you say it all like this you're trying to say all of
this is in favor of the idea that the dog is aggressive that it that way you're going
captain marvel and himself must be just a matter of inches because it's not like he was reaching
out with his hand in an extended fashion he's reaching out his hand in a way that makes it
seem like the map is directly in front of him and the map is directly in front of him that is true
almost like it is yeah i don't understand that point at all you reach hard it's literally right
in front of him you see it in every single shot whether it's from her her perspective or his
this dude is a lawyer you guys your avatars are both looking at me though
we're just like hey mauler hey i'm sorry i'll pick rags over here
hey if you don't have their uh after oh yeah of course you'll pick me i'm freshly showered
he makes contact with the map that captain marvel is holding pulls it down
and says something that might be interpreted as a threat how about a smile
that's interpretable how is that a threat well what is the threat of being done smiling how is
that bad would it be that she could argue that she felt that he was going to do something to
her if she didn't smile is that is that the argument well then what would be the implication
i don't know this is the thing if someone said like what would you do what would he do like treat
her to a nice dinner give her some money let's say you will tell her about what you're walking
out of the room in preparations if you were walking out of the room and i went wolf where you going
someone would be like oh that sounded like a threat oh wow are you asking me a question
but if i said do something if i said information about my personal life hey wolf where you going
someone would be like that's kind of a threat then if it went hey wolf oh uh where you going man
i was like no how could you and the way he asks are you saying that he would he ask is that like
a personal attack or something yes and this is the thing we get to assume we have this as video
evidence by the way because his whole case is made up of the idea that we see all of this so
yeah like we're a witness like so if you have a jury and they're supposed to decide whether or
not what he just said is a threat i think it would be quite the fucking stretch but then
i realized when i was thinking about that i was like what if people like brown table were in the
jury you'd be like yeah this was sexual harassment and then the other jurors would be like what the
fuck is wrong with you dude you're like oh what if all the other jurors are the same what if like
that's the world we're heading toward we're asking someone to smile we'll plant you in like six years
jail also yeah she did look at the dawn fist she gave him the the eye the male gaze
that's true just like brie is giving you the female and that's true just like regs is giving
you the doggo gaze for me this guy is not a particularly nice guy how do you conclude that
how fucking dare you okay you worth me name me one thing that he did that isn't nice i mean granted
if i'm looking at this objectively not memeing obviously i had the whole like
uh she clearly didn't want to talk to him and he pulls down the newspaper right like if i was in
that situation i'd be pretty irritated with him too but there's nothing he did that was like
horrible by any stretch it's not like a it's like a very like this is something that anybody could
do he could be a saint and he is but he could be a saint and do this and it's not like the pearly
gates are getting shut for him or anything okay it's like he just asked her to smile he asked
if she needed a ride anywhere literally offered to help her yeah but he said it in the aggressive
evil way yeah he's not a nice guy we've concluded this now and crucially here he has invaded
captain marvel's space this is a crucial distinction that we'll talk about crucial
second because in my opinion i think that that your opinion is incorrect definition of assault
and battery you're kidding wow in your opinion her threatening to rip his arm off and twisting
his hand to the point that he can't move is not assault but wolf but wolf because i i skipped you
i skipped through this i guess he's gonna justify that oh yeah of course he will he would also
justify oj simpson you know people did that too it doesn't make you would justify daderis target
and luke skyward he's like imagine the sergeant like captain marvel goes to court and wants to
put this man through court is a assault and battery and he's like i touched her map your honor
that's not a euphemism i just touched her map a little bit he might be able to argue it semantically
which we will we will check out for sure if he can but uh legally in like a court with a jury
they would never swallow this shit they would be like how the fuck is that assault and battery
yeah assault and bad fucking hell man but yeah well he does get into the terminology so we'll
have to check it out welcome to help you least you could do is give me a smile
so his hand has left the map he is still standing very close to her but okay appears that his arms
are at his it's not it's not exactly that much closer than like a cashier and a customer
yeah like if you brush hands with someone while you're giving them your credit card or
if you're just you've got somebody just pat him on the shoulder hey how you doing buddy
or something like that it's like it's such a brief he just he pushes it down for a second
and then he retreats his hand his intentions are obvious and clear he just wanted to move
the map out of the way to make eye contact with her someone in chat said the children's
screams could be seen as a threat that daderis was just hey i mean if you see a bunch of people
on fire running for you that could be yeah oh they're trying to set me on fire i mean granted
you were the one that started the fire but you know if they're running towards you it could be
like well gotta set him on fire even more oh my god this person is stupid yeah side and captain
marvel has taken the map put it to the side and she's about to confront this man how about a
handshake it was so polite i love that little handshake he's so bored with it it's a it's
literally a polite there's nothing you could even misconstrue it as other than just like being like
okay and she was the one who instigated he consented it was wonderful it can't be stressed
enough he's happy to get the handshake he smiles he's like oh i love to think that if this scene
continued and she didn't electrocute him he'd be like where are you going like so uh and maybe
he offers her a ride just that simple i want to see the movie i know we've been over this before
but i want to see it now what if captain marvel said you know i'm actually in a relationship
right now um but i i really do actually need a ride could you take me to you know spot x i would
really really appreciate that the don would be like absolutely he would even though i know that
you know you're not on the market i would absolutely take you to position x where you
need to go jesus man because he's out to ride anyway that's what he's out riding he's got his
jacket he's got his helmet his goggles he it's a gorgeous day he's out to ride at least to have
some company man oh don is love i agree chat i'm veers don is life people call me the don wow
and then he tries to pull his hand back he's done look at that he's so confused he's like why
would why would this be happening i was having a good time yeah he's like he's he's done with the
handshake he tries he's the one who tries to pull away he's like the handshake's over i she said her
name i've said my name i am pulling back the handshake i'm no longer going to be touching
her because she offered me this handshake she offered me the handshake and i'm done with the
handshake and i'm pulling back oh this makes me so angry i'm sorry someone said the don is in a
relationship with god he wasn't even hitting on the uh and he gives rides to orphans regularly
apparently so there's a jesus in every smile the don is basically the same character that ron
Williams played in august rush he like takes care of all the orphans in the home
there's not really a limit to his goodness you know that was robin williams right or am i thinking
of somebody else all right so i feel like i need to look it up what could be what could be considered
a consensual handshake which i was thank god yeah you could consider it a consensual a consensual
handshake considering she said how about a handshake and then extends her hand for a handshake
and he said oh yeah and then he also takes her hand what the fuck you could consider that
consensual it could be merely considered
he's in i guess electrocute because i actually didn't see the movie so i don't know exactly
what her powers are but god just just think about god and change nothing
he has god powers from space wait sorry let me go back did he say that he wasn't sure of
your power was it at which point captain marvel then begins to squeeze and
i guess electrocute this guy i actually didn't see the movie so i don't know you didn't see the movie
you don't have to see the movie let me highlight why it's important
i was gonna say let me well it's still important that he hasn't seen the movie especially for a
legal case because this is not a human being we're talking about it's an alien god you would know
this if it was a legal case because if you could get her into a court which is gonna be pretty
unlikely oh my god someone said the don used to play the guitar for the orphans used to oh
then she ruined his hand and now he can't play the guitar anymore
now the poor orphans will never be able never be able to hear the music he produces
she ruined his life i don't understand how you
is he aware that she's like a super powerful god or no because that would be relevant in the court
case right just like how i mean you would you can't like he's not even physically capable of
hurting here i'm a tiny little bit of research like the bare minimum of you you need to establish
people's power levels and potentials for these kinds of scenarios like if a child attacks you
as an adult then obviously you have incredible power over the child and it can't really hurt you
but you could do anything to the kid so that obviously is going to play in the legality of it
this is where the jury comes in as well because if the kid slapped you on your leg and then you
kicked them and they were like i'm literally talking like three foot right now you kick them
in the chest and they fling across the room and they get permanent like organ damage or something
and the jury saw that video they would just be like this is this is fucking wrong and they go
and the lawyer's like it's self-defense he was slapped on the back of the legs okay i get slapped
and the jury would be like that's hilarious you're wrong you can't possibly like i just swore you
tried to defend yourself so i've clearly got a lot of faith in the potential jury right now
like i'm just hoping juries aren't retarded but yeah i don't know electrocute this guy actually
didn't see the movie so i don't know exactly what her powers are but he's clearly in pain as a result
of this grip that captain marvel has uh put on in this i'm glad that he actually acknowledged that
the dorm was in pain because most people just be like nah nah he deserved it doesn't even whatever
he's whatever's going on there like this man is clearly in pain it's like thank you look at how
flat that ass is someone said here's some legalese for you assault with a deadly weapon because
that's what her powers are yes absolutely assault with a deadly weapon like i was i think i don't
need to make that point because she threatens to kill him
like i think i brought up in a previous stream it's like imagine like these are real world
scenarios you can compare this to like if she had a gun and she used that gun to threaten his life
you could just swap swap out the powers for a handgun boom yeah but what if he said it was
into self-defense because he asked her to smile come on oh yeah i forgot she'll fucking shoot
him three in the chest i mean it's only six to the back of the head suicide he's clearly in
pain as a result of this grip that captain marvel has uh put on in this handshake here's a proposition
for you you're gonna give me your jacket your helmet and your motorcycle and in return also
we're halfway through this he's trying to pull back uh i hope he's because there's no defense
for his stealing his shit surely because that's not even relevant to whether or not it was self-defense
i know she'd make an argument like she was trying to run away from him
as as he literally flees into the store looking for help
extortion let me let me look up extortion real quick the practice of obtaining something
especially money through force or threats she's literally committing extortion right now
oh definitely she's she's she's she's framing it as i'm allowing you to purchase your life
oh she's like i i give me your shit or i will physically hurt you
okay so why do i think that this may qualify as assault and battery well battery is a criminal
offense involving the unlawful physical contact or touching of another so is what he did
bear under this definition i don't think so i think because we have enough precedence in society i
i think any lawyer anybody any normal person would say if we're going to use this definition
for a battery without applying anything contextual to it then every time you come into contact with
somebody else that's battery what you bought something at the cashier store and you brushed
their hand while giving them your credit card that's battery what you bumped into somebody
accidentally when you're waiting in line some plate that's battery someone taps you on the
shoulder to say hello or that's battery i mean it's well i'm curious this is the thing if we're
really allowed to do this like if i poked rags and using a mood with me like i literally just
poked him could he actually accuse me of battery like that's ridiculous that'd be like you can't
just make contact with somebody i mean battery is a criminal offense involving the unlawful
physical contact of another person he's considered harmful i guess but look at that considered
offensive also it's it's very important to note that um well i took that enhanced concealed carry
license uh class uh about a week ago you are not allowed now this will vary by state to state i
think to some degree but here in arkansas you cannot use your handgun you can't use the threat
of deadly force or deadly force to defend your property so even if somebody is the law as it
currently stands in my state so pets if someone is beating the shit out of your dog you can't
legally shoot them if someone is killing your chattel really you can't you can't no you can't
if someone's beating my dog i'm yeah yeah yeah um like i don't care like that's that's what the law
is you have to come up with something stupid law you shoot can you wound them you can't just shoot
them um it depends how you wound them if you shoot them and you wound them just using the gun is
using deadly force so even firing warning shots is the user if they're like literally beating your
animal though that's yeah well you're gonna have to do something not violent it's violent but it's
violence to property under the law so you have to come up with some other method of getting your
dog away that doesn't involve deadly force if you want to stay you know legally protected um
there are there are circumstances where assault like if somebody sets fire to your house while
you're in it you can use self-defense obviously because that's immediate you know bodily you know
potential bodily harm to you um if somebody so generally if you have property that counts as
like a living space and people damage that while you're in it yeah absolutely if there's actual
credible threat to your life but in a case like this with captain marvel that map i don't i think
you'd really have to stretch to get a jury to say yeah this is my thing you might be able to stretch
it semantically but no jury is going to agree with this you'd have to be insane someone says
chat you're wrong he's like i literally just took the six hour class like a week ago for my state
like i i would love to i'd love for you to tell me where i'm wrong someone's people keep saying
i'm gonna be what isn't deadly force john wick what is deadly force no no no no once you shoot
the gun that's using deadly force because you're shooting a gun but this is what the law is man i
gotta this is i was gonna say it does it does sound like rags is just repeating what he was
told it's not like we have we have yeah we have legal precedent people have been sent to jail for
firing warning shocks at people who have invaded you know personal or private property because
firing the gun is using deadly force because it's a gun but you said you're allowed are you allowed
to shoot someone who's broken into your house um for the most part what do you mean for the
most part yeah for the yeah for the most part in then one what's the exception to the most part
if you had a scenario where so because because i don't want to give a blanket always yes
just always say generally yes there can be scenarios where someone is in your house
but they are not in any way a threat to you um for instance most of the time when the police
get the call of somebody being found in someone else's house it's some retarded dude who like
just no like actually yeah like a drunk goes into the wrong house like this is a real thing that
happens so if you wake up and there's a drunk person in your couch sleeping you can't shoot him
that would be that makes sense yeah stuff like that and and i was gonna say probably a child
right like if a five-year-old broke a piece of glass and then climbed into your house
and you were to shoot them dead you'd probably be in some trouble there potentially
say that one more time sorry so if like a five-year-old kid broke the glass of like a
window or something and climbed into your house and then you shot them dead you'd probably be in
pretty big trouble in it yeah if a five-year-old breaks into your house like throws just throws
a brick through the window or whatever breaks it crawls in there is no way you can shoot him
um there's just no way but yeah like i said semantic well you know what let's see how he
applies this generally like generally when people break into your house the scenario that you think
of got people there to rob you and they got crowbars or whatever yeah generally yes and
would have been considered harmful or offensive and battery is distinct from the separate crime
of assault which is the act of creating the apprehension of a five-year-old has a gun
what is assault assault is any credible threat or attempt to create apprehension of harmful
contact interestingly he does say i think sycorp have it was that most people mix up assault and
battery and i'm definitely one of those people i didn't realize assault was this i always assumed
assault was actually hitting people but a credible threat stand your ground isn't a law that applies
to every state arkansas is actually a duty to retreat state but it's not what generally
people think duty to retreat is it's not it's a fine i have no problem with the concept of duty
to retreat is it's legally uh defined essentially and look at this as this uh definition assault is
any credible threat or attempt to create apprehension well so this is exactly this is why we have a
right so what was the threat and what was the apprehension if i had a chainsaw and i was
bringing it down on your head and you roll backwards to avoid it and you have video of
this a jury can conclude that that was assault for sure but if i had my hand just above your
head by like an inch and i was patting you and i went to do a two inch pat and you rolled away and
you were like that was a credible threat a jury would be like you're a fucking joke that's why
the jury controls this right these are these are just guidelines to set up the the prosecution
slash defense and then the jury has to decide whether or not it's a fair application of the
law is that how it works or am i making shit up anyone yeah i'm just this it's odd that he
brought this up because i mean from her perspective there's no way he could do anything to her
and she knows it more that gives her that's confirmed it's no way yeah i'm not a lawyer
that's why i i just assumed that that's how this works because fucking hell if we were to go by as
long as it can fit this definition wouldn't like everyone be in jail by now because it's like
someone looked at me it was a credible threat contact or unlawful touching there are two
flavors of battery in most jurisdictions there's the crime of battery which is prosecuted by the
state and then there's also the tort of battery which is what you would accuse someone of if you
wanted to sue them for civil damages in michigan is a state in which you stand your ground law
supply so have fun shooting the guy who beats your dog no sweet i can do it
like i said like even if it was against the if i saw like beating up my dog it's like
if i got a gun a lot of people yeah a lot of people would shoot him anyway it'd be tough to
not do that that was uh yeah i mean it would be tough to not you know if i was in that situation
unless i was like sure beyond a shadow of a doubt like my dog was going to die any second
then i'd probably just pointed at him and i'd be like yeah get the hell away from my dog right
yeah i'm definitely down with the idea that if you start going around beating someone's dog and they
shoot your ass it's like well i'm gonna it's gonna be tough for you to garner any sympathy with me my
dude executed by the state and then there's also the tort of battery which is what you would accuse
someone of if you wanted to sue them for civil damages in a lawsuit but most of this discussion
should apply to both by way of example california penal code section 242 defines battery as any
willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon johnson that goes for fear of assault or battery
any willful and unlawful use of force upon another person is probably the one he's going to be trying
to use of another to meet this criteria i guess maybe he's going to try to stretch the definition
of he's gonna stretch the shit out of it stretch the fuck out of that definition has to be able
to prove that the defendant intentionally and unlawfully touched another person in a harmful
or offensive manner and the second element which is that the defendant did not act in self-defense
or in the defense so he's saying as long as you can prove that the don was not acting in self-defense
which yeah you can say that and that uh what he did could be looked at as possible as a possible
threat then no no i'd say i'd say the only thing that they would even have a chance of doing
is running with is is running with offensive yeah because there's no way the jury's going to
consider that a threat so people people in chat people in chat saying he didn't touch it he is
going to cover that in a second because this gets so loophole it makes me hate lawyers even more
someone else can i just say that that is a beautiful like extremely favorable profile
shot of the don like he should use that for his irl facebook picture fucking rude man
even the slightest touch can be enough to satisfy the battery statute if it's done without consent
or in the harmful or offensive but she was the one who asked him for the handshake it can be
counted but it would never get through court unless you have extreme circumstances such as
it was an old person teetering on the edge of a fucking staircase and you touched them and then
they fell over and died by falling down the stairs right like and a jury would have to see the video
evidence that like yeah you fucking killed them you're like i just touched them um it's not murder
it's just a little nudge in the harmful or offensive way in fact you learn very early on
in law school about the so-called eggshell skull theory which is that if you make contact with
someone who oh yeah so there you go the idea that there are people out there that if you do
a tiny tiny touch too you could potentially kill them um but the thing is wouldn't this again
isn't applicable captain marvel the jury would never allow this to go through
legal principle that states that the frailty weakness sensitivity or feebleness of a victim
cannot be used as a defense in a tort case that won't apply to cap marvel well wouldn't
it be the reverse if anything she's super powerful yeah that's the thing she can't be harmed in
basically any way in any way someone said uh eggshell response theory
eggshell egg milk i can't wait yeah some people say that would apply to him yeah like again we'd
have to be i think it's fair to say we'd be aware of her abilities in this court case
fragile skeleton she fucking in the video she electrocutes him with her hands so we'd be like
she's clearly not human or she yeah it's a part of his suit and then they'd have to analyze the
suit and find out the voltage and then they find out it's just here i'd assume that yeah i assumed
that we would know because because all this court stuff would happen after the events of the movie
in which case everything that they'd know and they'd get all that they'd have all the info that
essentially the audience would know because if they didn't and that would be it wouldn't be a
fair court case everyone is frail to the dog as a skull that is as thin as an eggshell you're
liable for those damages even if the kind of touching that you do would not even hurt another
person but if it's enough to hurt someone with a very unusual condition what we call the eggshell
skull i don't actually know if that is an actual medical condition or not that's enough to make
you on the hook for the damages that you cause as a result of your unconsented to touching or
battery in this case and she asked him for the handshake i think i think he's talking about the
map thing the map you can't there's no way he's talking about the handshake that she offered
no yeah i actually do i think there's a chance i'm pretty sure he's about to justify it i'm
i'm a little lost right now i'm confused what point he's trying to make i'm assuming he's about
to bring it around yeah like if i was in the jury i'd be like i'd raise my hands like judge question
are we talking about him touching the map for that second or the handshake she offered him
cause as a result of your unconsented to touching or battery in this case and almost as important is
that the contact requirement with another person is satisfied even if it's just touching their
clothing or if you touch something that is immediately connected to that there we go we've
come full circle so if i was to poke rags in the eye that's very different from me poking him in
the contact lens because it's not his eye but it would still potentially do the exact same kind of
damage and then you can extend that forward to the glasses he's wearing or a gas mask that i
fucking poke right through and he's about to say like if rags was holding a rope i don't know and
i pulled it really hard without you realizing i could really do damage to your arm um if you were
you know grasping it hard yeah you just pulled me down you just pulled me down and i'd fall on the
ground and so he's right but fucking hell we're talking about the map here like are you kidding
yeah it's like is that law real is is the spirit of that law that you have to convince a jury about
is that really gonna be in one of those situations where you're hurting people's immediate articles
is the jury gonna be like oh yeah that's battery what you did like and this is the thing that's
why we actually get to have a valid response to this because we could potentially be in that jury
yeah so if you punched someone and you punch them through their shirt now technically you
haven't made contact with that person yes that's what the laws for shirt is so connected to the
person punching them through a garment of some kind is enough to satisfy the that would be the
slimiest fucking lawyer on the planet to be like well she was holding the map and he did touch the
map so that's battery this is the well that's what i'm saying you can do it but what jury is
going to accept that like what kind of a human being do you have to do to make that kind of an
argument kind of human being this whole video would be one of those things where he's like
this is dumb but an asshole lawyer would argue this in court this is what i mean this is not
what he does on his channel typically i'm the asshole lawyer she's good he usually like from
what i understand there's some people in chat saying his whole channel's bad like i wouldn't
go out far from what i've seen in his videos his whole thing is he's supposed to try and explain
to us what would eventually happen in a court of law as a result blah blah but this video he seems
desperate to try and defend her i don't know why like why is everybody doing that
and remember remember this would be a 90s jury
yeah which wouldn't be a modern jury even more so on the dollar side yeah i don't think there
would really be any difference between the two that much but remember this this took place in
the 90s when people hadn't been infected with this social justice feminist equality diversity
bullshit imagine being the defense lawyer for this shit you you you wouldn't believe your day
job you'd be like okay uh-huh right i'd be like i'm not taking this case i'm not no you take that
case i would take the shit out of defending the dog i feel like you can fucking oh yeah defending
the dawn not defending her no no someone pointed this out and i finally was really depressing
he said uh to make this even worse this guy is training the next generation of lawyers with this
line of argumentation well what's good about that is to be aware of how the law can be used
instead of it sneaking up on you you need to be aware that there are slime fucks out there that
do this with the law but he should be teaching them how to dismantle this bullshit instead of
how to come up with it so the top comment on his video is damn i've been assaulted and battered
much more often than real life yeah man you're missing out on all that sweet sweet legal money
oh yes and through i couldn't be a lawyer because i just couldn't i couldn't bring myself
to do this i just i don't i i'm too principled and morally good to be a lawyer you know i just
i couldn't do this kind of shit i i would be in law school listening to this guy talk and i'd be
like i can't do this i can't morally bring myself to do this isn't right what we're doing isn't
right i wouldn't have to be like an extremely principled lawyer and be like against this guy
at every turn because i couldn't do i couldn't put up this argumentation that he's doing because this
is disturbing to me because like the she was actually defending her actions of assaulting
and stealing his property that's that's really messed up man especially when it's the dawn
so especially the person punching them through a garment of some kind is enough to satisfy the
touching of a person yes that's why of course we all agree with that like the idea you can punch
someone in the arm where they're wearing clothes yes and crucially that extends to things that are
immediately connected outside of the clothing as well so for example if someone was walking down
the street and they were holding a cell phone in their hand if you went up to that person
and smacked the cell phone right out of their hand well even if you don't actually make contact
with the person's hand or their forearm the fact that they were holding the cell phone and it fell
out but he didn't do that and yeah this is the thing that scenario there's there's a case to be
made in some way shape or form he folded over the map slowly and she ended up being the one
pulled it down like hmm
that's enough to qualify as battery for the person and if the victim saw you coming
and was in apprehension of that contact then you'd also be guilty of the crime and tort of
assault as well that's the apprehension of the physical contact so not only would that
count as destruction of property it would also qualify as potentially this is such a thing as
like because he's gonna go into yeah you get why he's setting all this up right i don't know if
you've caught on yet trying to create he's trying to say that the scenario with the map is like the
ones that he's building up here that yes but do you because the main criticism of her is the
fucking brutalizing and he's about to make the defense for that in relation to all of this
like i'm being facetious but he's essentially trying to set up a self-defense case here
i guess it sounds like yeah he sounds like he's really going to bat for catamaran and
i just like is there such a thing as like say for example you slapped me and then i
fucking punched you in the face you fell over and i punched you again and again and again
is there not a case you could make or your lawyer could make that i was like excessively
self-defensing myself if you know absolutely absolutely self-defenses generally you have to
you can only respond with you know an appropriate level of you know you know a return you know you
have what i guess the word i guess you'd say it's um it's just it's just it's a fairly mundane word
that's actually generally used legally for it because i was gonna say like she's a god alien
like how do you yeah you can only use appropriate force from responding to something like the lowest
minimal force that you can use is generally what's accepted i guess i'm gonna noise you
you can't kill them yes i think that's a fair law i agree with that one my god if that was legal
so what have the people i've met would be dead
it's like appropriate or proportional or something like that
that christ qualify as potentially the crime of assault and battery we see that in the clip
the man on the motorcycle invades captain marvel's physical space there was no reason for him to
stand up from his motorcycle and walk the 10 to 15 feet away from the motor she was looking at the
map he was gonna help reason he wanted to talk to her the reason was he wanted to he makes that
explicit he says um if i'm gonna help you the least you could do is give me a smile
he's made his intention clear verbally wants to help you
what a criminal can you believe he stood up from his motorcycle he didn't write it into the store
and yeah for his items i don't know why he assumed he said that as if the normal thing
for the dog to have done there was just to sit permanently on his motorcycle it's like forever
into captain marvel's physical space there was no reason for him to place his hands on the map or
the newspaper the captain well he clearly did it so he could see her face yeah if we're talking
about i'll also notice that this this picture here is the extent of the most violence that he uses
yeah but that is what's the appropriate level of self-defense here i'd say
you know good guy i'd say please go away a minigun yeah please go away
i'd say i'd say put a grenade in the dawn's pocket is the only appropriate response to this
reverse pickpocket him and send him on his way well had in her hands now of course no one's
going to argue that captain marvel was physically harmed by this interaction yeah i thought you were
just weird okay that's not no because and shell theory crime of battery all that is required is
the touching of something that is immediately connected to captain marvel and i think that
makes the statutory definition of assault yeah well a jury wouldn't agree with you terrible
you should know that it's not assault no it's not assault no jury would never agree with this
way apprehensions or fear life that's not assault how could you possibly think this is assault
well he said it matches the definition which he might be right about that because fucking
a shit ton of things match the definition but he also said that that we are morally incorrect
he did say that i wonder if he comments on that because we only got four and a half minutes left
so let's see and the fact that he has invaded her personal space that he's standing he's mentioned
the personal space thing like five times in the last minute yeah and i don't buy that it's
personal space does he pull it mentally retarded terminator argument is there a legal definition
of the amount of a bubble around you that's a personal space like in an actual length
i don't i don't know if there's a legal definition for personal space let me google that real quick
maybe we shouldn't be shocked is the space is the okay so this is just from definition
dot us legal dot com personal space is an approximate area surrounding an individual
and which other people should not physically violate in order for them to feel comfortable
and secure it is the zone around individuals which they regard as psychologically theirs
say regard the amount of oh oh at the end the amount of personal space required for any given
person is subjective what what the hell are we supposed to do with that so going by the
definition on and this isn't the be all end all but on us legal dot com on the definitions bit
that is what it is um personal uh let's see it also depends on how well you know the other person
intimate the relationship the less personal space is involved the law does not recognize
a specific crime or civil action based on violation of personal space per se how can
that however the law does recognize various actions based on assault harassment and unwelcome
touching right well that makes sense if you twist that yeah but like okay fine most of them carry
this is really i think this is such a stretch but absolutely statutory definition of assault
and the fact that he has invaded her personal space that he's standing only inches away from
her saying no he's not he's not in she's away with that because the implication is between
two and five or something i mean i'm inches away from the moon yeah a couple of inches for sure
three i think that could arguably constitute a threat against her i think that qualifies as
assault as well so this guy's actions i think constitute the harmful or offensive touching of
captain marvel she is described where would our society be where would our society be harmful
this is harmful touching where this is why it's it's just better to stay with dudes at this point
yeah like honestly i tell people this all the time like man you can't beat pussy but jesus christ
dudes are so so much easier to just get along with and talk with and hang out with and there's
so much more casually easygoing for the most part and besides they wouldn't use you because
lawyers like this exist lawyers like this existing make the world a worse place
harmful touching lead the victim of being battered by this guy
on the motorcycle and the thing about being a victim of effectively battery and the apprehension
of battery assault that gives you access to the legal justification shank out apprehension assault
self-defense apprehension of battery self-defense she ain't got apprehension of battery of what is
what is the there's no way what is the reasonable self-defense for someone folding your map over
i it's telling him to stop and backing away taking the back away and step back and go what
do you do it yeah at that point there is absolutely no misconception that can be made that you don't
want to talk with this person and it's not just a oh he talked to me he said one thing and i ignored
him no no no no no no once you say get you get away from me and you take a step back that's very
obvious that's what you should do that's what i would do well no i wouldn't i would say absolutely
take me away handsome stranger not to mention uh she shook his hat she asked him to shake
her hand so clearly the whole feeling threatened thing doesn't apply here not to mention his entire
part with like she's clearly in the position of power
yeah so like how could she be threatened when when she's making jokes as he's in
struggling in pain like i don't understand how you i haven't even seen this retarded movie
but just looking at this scene you can clearly tell she's like messing up his arm when she's
shaking it he's trying to pull away you have to be like a genuinely awful horrible evil person to
make this argument and i hate to say the evil words but jesus oh yeah no i think this fits the
bill man he is a mess is genuinely scummy because she's not like if you're gonna be accidentally
hurting him she's doing it because she wants to feel superior she wants to take his shit
and at the end she gives him a snide remark about smiling no remorse she wants to hurt this guy
well i'm confused because that's evil in his opening he's talking about all these conclusions
people have made while considering everything so far he's only talked about the moving of the map
and then the response to that like what about the the grand theft auto what about that is there a
legal justification for that is he just not going to touch that we're running out of time so we'll
have to see arguably she was partially justified here now those are of course partially legal
arguments but even if we're going to talk about philosophy oh let's i think morally speaking
it's the motorcycle guy who initiates force and wow holy no my brain my brain fuck you
you can look at his right force look at his furrowing at the brow is his tiny brain struggles
to actually make an argument for this you absolutely disingenuous fucking cunt wow
fuck you i cannot believe that a person in the world would actually make this terrible argument
what a terrible channel i got nothing to say like i just i guess god imagine look at his social
blade and i'm gonna hope to god it went down after this i mean it's not a very
legal legal eagle yes no space legal eagle oh no that's he didn't go down
or he's doing fine we didn't get a lot of views for this relative channel so even if we're gonna
i think morally speaking it's the motorcycle guy who initiates force
and under almost any conception he's not a person once someone has initiated force against you
you are privileged enough to use the defense of force against that person yes that is true
but when you only have levels of force i was gonna say when you stay that vague
like what are you saying that if if someone brushes past me in the street i can mow them
down with a minigun like i'm confused yeah then you say self-defense self-defense yo because he
i love that he specifies philosophically and then he doesn't give any details he's like
when someone does a thing you can do a thing you're like yeah i suppose if only we had more
rules to clarify oh we do you can't kill people who annoy you what do you know so long as you
don't escalate from using normal force into using she threatened to use deadly force how can he say
this let's see what he says maybe she literally literally verbatim unironically threatened to rip
his arm off what other than deadly force could that possibly be force against that person so
long as you don't escalate from using normal force into using deadly force which it doesn't appear
that captain marvel did he doesn't appear so when she threatens to take off his arm that's just a joke
threatens to to blow off his hand she said she threatened first off she won't let him retreat
right and if you in any self-defense case like uh like you can't shoot someone who is disengaging
and retreating from you you can you can do it if if they if someone comes up to you and they threaten
your life right and then something happens and they are running away from you they're going down
the street they're not armed anymore they're no longer a threat and you shoot them that's murder
like he was clearly trying to disengage and get away from her and she is holding on to him and
making threats against him there's no way that you can apply this no jury on this planet they
would laugh you out of the fucking courtroom this is insane here was captain marvel justified in
taking this motorcycle oh you gotta add the the dawn is an ass hat guys just so you know
yeah he's an ass hat okay so and jacket no even if he was
probably not yeah probably not this is hurting my brain it's like
and some motor cycle and jacket no probably not but mr. hat motorcycle rider committed
battery in the first place yeah you just because you say that doesn't make it true
i like that he's he went through that first like 10 minutes of trying to vaguely prove by stretching
everything that she committed battery so that now in this end bar you can say he did commit battery
so and it's like did he though did he though and deserve some of what came to him he deserves
some of what came to him some of it some of it like you know what he deserved he deserved
like let's talk it let's even framing it as deserved right if you put on black clothes
and run across a busy intersection in the middle of the night with your eyes closed you don't
deserve to be hit by a car that's just the natural result of what will happen by putting
yourself in that scenario when like when a kid sticks his a butter knife at a socket he doesn't
deserve to be shocked that's just a natural result of his actions when the dawn goes up to
her and he asks her for a smile he doesn't deserve to be had to have his life threatened
i mean deserve is a moral argument right physical body i mean i'm only in the most
vegas we're gonna be full you kind of deserve it in law can you you deserve this you know what i
would you know what just occurred to me i wonder if the actor who played the don has seen the
vehement defense of him and he's like like he's just sitting at home he feels i like this comment
he deserved to be thanked politely and then have his kind off client yeah that's what he deserved
absolutely i would have accepted his offer if i was here um yeah i would have been like yeah
actually this is exactly literally totally 100 fully what i need right now i do need someone
to give me a ride someplace because i don't know how to operate your human vehicles i don't know
how your traffic laws work and i need to keep a low profile so yeah having a ride with you
would make total sense but the writers forgot what writing is so i'm gonna instead imagine your
life and steal your if we had had the dawn captain marvel and samuel jackson as a trio going through
the plot in this movie put him in so much better and then like the dawn keeps making advances on
it because he's kind of he's got like a crush and samuel jackson's like can make jokes and stuff
could have been great could have been great and we can argue about how much force was justified
yeah we could argue about that but i guess you won't because it's gonna get in the way of your
argument i don't know mention captain marvel because you know his ass is countersuing you
for the theft of his property and the physical assault to him the extortion and the threats of
deadly force because if you're threatening to take off someone's hand that's deadly force you can't
even do it because she leaves earth at the end of that film so who's who's the dawn gonna find
justice hashtag no justice for dawn no justice for dawn at all no justice for the dawn
but he is a man so he gets it force was justified in what kind of apprehension oh my god i know the
dawn's real name no no no no i don't want to know his real name he is the dawn he is the
dawn people in the chat people no the people in the chat don't need to know either i speak for
no no i want to see if he has he has a twitter i want to i want to know i want to know please
tell me please for the love of god tell me you've seen some of this but it's like i like how this
guy says we can argue about you know the the boring part we can have a really short discussion
about what would literally define whether or not this is valid it's like yeah we can talk about
that really not really yeah it'll take us five seconds let's do it people in the chat are calling
donathan was in and what kind of fear she faced from the sky none certainly it is not as clear
cut as captain marvel is the villain yes it is though why is it what do you how do you even he
hasn't even come up with a justification for the theft of his motorcycle and breaking the law when
she drives further cars or the motorcycle guy was completely innocent it's never black and white
the legal reality you tried to try to make it pretty black and white if it's never black and
white then we wouldn't have any villains is is that his point so how do you saying it's not black
and white that makes his position worse the different well he's a lawyer like of course
nothing's black and white is always gray my guess is that some but not all of the force was justified
at the end of the day this tempest in a teapot was really about a select few people who wanted
to have a very idiosyncratic view of this deleted scene uh yeah you're one of them they can oh yeah
i think you're projecting a little bit here that's not a legal term but i think you're projecting a
little bit yeah him brown table quite a few others they have an absolutely not only insane
but concerning view of the uh the event and really i guess we don't have a terminator comparison
those mansplainers who wanted to make it oh oh did he just say that oh what did he say are you
on three 1306 right now 1305 yeah okay good who wanted to have a very idiosyncratic view of this
deleted scene and really all of those mansplainers who wanted to make a clever point about captain
marvel being oh no mansplainers mansplainers sorry all right so wait who are we we're so
mansplaining requires for a man to explain something to a woman so all the male people
that we've been responding to we can't mansplain to men i guess that's not really the definition
isn't he mansplaining to us right now no because we're not women oh fuck if we there's got to be
some woman that watched this video though so he's man he's committed to mansplaining something
didn't she she you may have seen this video yeah so that's at least one he's an sj w that's great
mansplainer is that a legal term that you're going to use in the court
ended up your honor my client is innocent mansplaining what a joke can you imagine like a
judge hearing that war being like oh yeah they're just be like do you mean explain because no
mansplain they're just like what captain marvel can you explain for the rest of the world what
this word means as far as i can tell whatever they say what they mean to say is to condescendingly
explain something yeah a man has to do it to a woman yeah a man has to condescendingly explain
something to someone said he's mansplaining to star wars girl yeah i think ended up becoming
the thing that they hate most in this world they are you become the very thing you sought to destroy
and as an aside everyone recognizes that this scene is basically an homage to what happens
in terminator 2 right no uh that might be what they tried to do i'm going to say this because
i've watched all the terminator movies for some you know part partly to my benefit mostly to my
detriment uh very recently so i have terminator 2 very fresh in my mind still so please do try and
tell me how this is an homage to terminator 2 he's one of my favorite films of all time he's
gonna be wrong whatever he says this scene is shot for shot exactly what happens to arnold's
no it's not you know what the really important differences are uh capture bubble doesn't get
burned by a cigarette she doesn't get stabbed in the arm she doesn't have someone pull a gun on
here she doesn't get a pool cue snapped on the back of her head she's not a robot trying to save the
world this is so bad already portnegger in t2 i need your clothes your boots oh man good movie
and your motorcycle no no you skipped the part no no you skipped you cut out the part where he
hit no you lying lawyer fuck what about the power on he was uh physically assaulted battered
for a real he put a lit cigarette on his bare skin and you just cut that part out you just
cut that part out oh my god and this is this is just ignoring arnie is a robot his only mission
directive is to keep john connor alive there is nothing else he will do that by any means
necessary there is a point in this movie where arnie is about to blow a kid's hat off with a
gun and john connor has to tell him not to the whole point of the movie is that arnie is not
a good person he's not a hero he's a protagonist protecting the hero why do i have to explain he's
not a good person that we we're judging the morality simple shit we're judging the morality
of captain marvel we have deemed her a villain because she has a moral compass and it's fucked
you cannot do that with a robot you can't go the robot is evil he doesn't have a moral compass
he's a he has a mission he's programmed and even if he uh did exactly the same thing as captain
marvel it's not the robot's fault it's the guy who made the robot and programmed him
and if this is such simple shit i know that simple concepts are not exactly something that
gets through this in his head but my god this is i mean you literally have to just ignore the movie
it's not shot for shot by the way they call it shot for shot is annoying me
like you clearly edit it out a lot on top of this right um terminator two is not a difficult
film to understand so the fact that people can't says a lot about how dumb most people are if they
can't get terminator two it's it's no way called arnold swartzneger a villain in the scene you can't
be he's a robot you can't have a robot villain it has to like in any scenario where robot is
actually like bender could be a villain specifically because bender has like an actual moral compass he
has emotions the terminator in this movie is his fucking arc in the movie is trying to understand
what emotions are and at this point in the film we think he's evil he's actually like portrayed
as the villain and look i don't i don't even think that's the argument that people should go
with that he was meant to be portrayed as evil at first because i mean the argument he used to go
with i mean he was that he was actually assaulted i mean well you can just say that he's a robot and
he was programmed the context is you would say force for evil this is force for good with uh
he is a force for good specifically because we align with the morals of the human protagonist
it's a very because we have to be pedantic because that's the entire thing here is is the
difference between captive marvel and a fucking robot i can't believe like people will so casually
refer to a robot and be like see it's fine this killer robot did it with better the killer robot
did it with better justification absolutely he's a way better character as well like that's why this
dude edited out the part no one called arnold swartz where the villain in the scene everybody
knows he's the hero i mean no obviously no he's not no he's no more a fucking hero than a gun
he is a tool first off he's not a hero second off he's uh like people say you know he's not
portrayed as a hero at the beginning of the movie it's not until the hallway he's on john it's
ambiguous we don't know for sure but we assume villain because of the previous movie assuming
you watch them in order and it's you know it would have to watch like the trailer yeah
just just to refer to him as a hero is inaccurate but i could understand why you would say that but
it's it i have to point out how inaccurate is compared to captain marvel everybody knows jay
says it's about to get worse obviously he was the villain in terminator one but he's the good guy in
terminator two in this scene from captain marvel no you're fucking retarded exactly the same scene
it's not exactly begging her to let go he's a robot then why was it important for the robot to
drive loads is that a serious question is that somebody just asked sorry hang on you know
okay let me explain this concept to you the whole the rules that the movie establishes
and the time travel like we're not even going to touch that because i already know that's
time travel already is messed up the rules of the time travel machine is that you can't take
clothes in it only like biological like that's why they have real skin right that's what allows
them to go through that but they need to integrate and not integrate but they need to blend in to
society will be retarded how are you going to blend in if you're running around naked
like the terminators are cognizant of that fact
come on the movie terminator literally explains it in terminator two and this
scene from captain marvel is basically exactly the same scene but i guess it's different if the
superhero has a vagina no okay so ignoring that remember he has to track down the guy that he
injured the guy is hand guy's hand he runs away he crawls to the back room in his corner
as arnold comes at him with a gun at this point before he gives him the keys just trying he just
wants to survive like arnold had to go out to find him to track him down but let's back it up
this video is actually pissing me off i i don't want to hate fuck something right now
oh well you know i got some time after the show basically exactly the same scene over again
oh you know someone yeah but i guess it's different if the superhero has a vagina
no it's a different if mr motorcycle it's no it's different if the higher context and characters
literally everything is basically different than it will be a different scenario regardless of
if you look at it really simply even a man it's a robot it's just
you're comparing a woman with a robot there's not even a man involved
is that that's that's the thing it's not he doesn't even have like
he's not gendered it's a robot why does no one remember that the terminators are not humans
why is this something we have to remind people of
someone said to write that down mauler oh that's a good point i haven't written anything down from
this one post your favorite quotes from this insane tism in chat and i'll try and pick a few
of them up what was so what even would be the quote that i'm writing down right now
i think it was the whole like it's okay if you're a woman you can guess it's okay
it's not okay if you have a vagina
i'm literally texting someone now fuck because this video was just i'm so upset
people like this are are out there and they're real and they're teaching people shot for shot
that's what most people are saying legally and morally touching the map is battery
he was standing inches from her i'm gay
yo what are you doing rax what's the hate fuck apparently
um i pretend yeah i just say can i pretend to hate you
fucking hell man mostly bad have a problem with this scene that's true
you know work too because i haven't i haven't eaten because once i woke up essentially
we were doing stuff so i gotta eat anyway i get it buy a bitch some buy a bitch some crazy hibachi
i don't know that's the mauler that's the mauler the video is uh coming to a close
there is a certain frog that is uh streaming that we should we should send people his way
why'd you want to disrupt his e3 coverage because i like to disturb frugal from time to time
right well let's hope this is near the ending douchebag lost his jacket and helmet he could
really use a whole wardrobe makeover black leather is so five years ago he could really
use a slim cut five years ago wasn't that long ago uh uh there was in like what was the year this
movie 92 oh captain marvel um was it yeah 89 to 95 i think it was
like it was 95 in the scene that why would he wear a suit on his bike no that doesn't make
sense he was really bad leading but like i was gonna say so it was the fucking the more you know
his hand don't suit from indochino which he could even wear to his arraignment for battering carol
danvers all of my suits are now uh oh where we say not guilty we're the one where we say
yeah he's innocent but this bitch is a fucking psychopath she needs to be locked up that one
people are saying people are saying this is an ad well it's obviously an ad i know it's it's
yeah i know it's an ad yeah well well i mean i i could have been mistaken for him being
unironically so we we know it's an ad it's just a shitty segue yeah just you know what you could
wear on his bike instead of a biker jacket that is amazing that everyone loves a suit that makes it
no i mean he's made worse arguments in this video estimated by did you have your clothes
stolen by a psychopath he did say it seems like a great time to mention by sponsor what a great
he did say you'd have like an after credit suit including this three-piece suit that i'm wearing
right now with a custom double-breasted vest which i think is awesome i love indochino suits and i
buy them with my own yeah you don't know what the rest looks like you don't know what a breast looks
like because you're too afraid to talk to women because you know it would be illegal to touch the
woman yeah yeah no not touch a woman's map they personally reached out to them and i'm thrilled
that they're now a sponsor of this channel see the secret to wow i don't care i think lesser of them
because of that i think lesser of indochino because you like them your your admiration of
them is like a stain on their reputation all about the fit i'm a reasonably athletic guy and i can
never buy suits off the rack because they just simply never fit right indochino will make you
a fully oh you can choose the style the fabric for less than 400 dollars and the best part is
they still use the best pretty good deal super 140 wool instead after credits i think they still
use the best materials they used to but they still do i guess this counts as a credit again you have
tons of choices too you can send your measurements in fucking get on with the jesus or you can go to
a physical store and have a stylus take i'll send i'll send him my measurements when my buddy andrew
took all of my measurements for over 90 minutes when i went in for the first time and took my
measurements and a couple weeks later i got the best fitting super fucking stupid thing he's wearing
on his arm perfect right out of the box legal eagles can maybe it's like a measurement device
just three seven is it like a clip on tape measure or something why would it take 90 minutes to do
measurements i guess they have to take a bunch of them and they have to make sure they're right
like they have to measure your your thighs and your calves and chest and your shoulders and
your arm length yeah i mean i i i do a 90 minute measure sesh to get a super cool fitting code
legal from indochina or indochino in the description
clicking on the link really helps out this channel that's indochino.com promo code legal
eagle for the best custom for your life wow captain marvel is not a villain because she
beats up on a guy who battered her but she is a villain because she did battered her
infinity battered her she had it in her hand she was carrying it like a football
why didn't you just put the gauntlet on carol just snap your fingers
why did he why did he give himself white eyes when he did that
i don't know but he didn't batter her okay so that was that video uh i had like by the time
we actually covered it i had like 15 requests to cover it it it was awful that shit
well absolutely awful um i'm glad these things are successful i suppose is this how this works
stream right everyone go to fringy's channel i guess i need to
should we just should we just type ideally no let's criticize fringy's live stream okay
let's do it how long we got i can't pause though i don't know how long we have fringy
you're supposed to know this shit it's your stream wait is he stopped because it's got 13 out of an
hour hold on let me check maybe we'll just have to says he's still live right now um
let me pull it up on like wait guys i'm i'm confused i'm a little bit confused here is
this fringy's live stream yes okay he's like i just needed i just needed some clarification
it really ought to be coming out soonish i think
everyone just goes oh the joke doesn't count if it the watch together isn't showing on the
i can't it's not working properly on the joke work just no no open up yourself rags you absolute
mess i know i have it open it's for the chat i've got it's important they needed to see well they
do now they see that it's a fringy's live stream on it that was important i was just waiting for
fringy to real oh i think he's realizing he's very quiet now fringy you're quiet turn up your beak
he's just he's just turned on our stream now so i can hear our stream in his stream on our stream
all right uh stream section turn on the halo music and oh no no gears of war oh look a hammer
a black man a feminist i'm another feminist quick beater with a hammer yeah yeah which
i don't condone this is the best way to communicate yeah the memes that the dawn spawn man
we just ruin fringy's cover should be freaking making about the
i was gonna say we probably can't stay for long because i've got a shit ton of things for us to
get through yeah oh yeah we gotta we we really should get along with him fringy can cover his
video games and we will cover important things like the legal analysis of deleted scenes stay
on his stream if you want to check out some e3 coverage stay on odds if you want pure tismory
so you know which which use carefully do you want information or tismory so this video
is uh coverage of game of thrones since we've just seen a defensive captain marvel we've got
to seal it out with the game of thrones defense obviously it's a stream i want a vacation to escape
this it's a story like there wait wait wait hold on is this is this the one where i'm name dropped
or no no that's going to be the last thing we can know another skinny funhouse podcast
that's what i have to say i've never watched them but my god not a great first impression so there's
just a couple of really funny arguments they make i've got three timestamps they're nothing
too controversial but still funny um it's the name drop at least positive i'm not going to tell
you until you see i should satisfy that um i still think the decisions that benny off and wise have
made uh not only made a great television show but also was exactly the way it should have been done
for and this is exactly why i stopped listening to fun huh this is like heavily disliked do we have
mauler like unironically do we have to because this guy
take a little bit of a segue to appreciate the the catastrophically awful design of this setup
here with the chairs and the microphones because what if what if it looks back to retards when
to leave well now now first off that guy is going to have he has to batter her in order to get out
of his seat well well hold on worse than that is like look at the framing of this
it's who in the front you can't see their faces you're looking at the back of their heads well
they do have multiple cameras they're looking at the other ones think well because they're looking
at this either there's the screen or the monitor you're looking at it ours is better because you
can always see our faces which are prominently displayed at the bottom of the screen they even
light up when we're talking and the dawn is here are you familiar with project mouthwash no i'm not
i mean i use mouthwash wait is that is that some kind of personal attack or something
not only made a great television show but also was exactly the way it should have been done for
a television show of this caliber because again this caliber proves in the pudding the rating
the ratings are the highest they've ever been are they ratings no they're actually the lowest
numbers views yeah well no one cares about that oh yeah i was going to say that yeah so this the
guy on the left he out of this group is apparently the only one with a brain cell and uh when when
the guy brings that up he's i i actually don't like it when people say like this is the highest
rated thing i'm like do you mean view count or do you mean actual review numbers yeah like reception
or because who cares about the view count like fucking because if we're going by that then
anthropoid must be one of the worst yeah really really really good okay wait let me put an awful
yeah what's what's the guy like clarify with him immediately because he thought it was really bad
the proofs in the pudding the rating the ratings are the highest they've ever been uh the ratings
the ratings in terms of people even number yeah even she clarifies like hey what do you mean about
the rating in terms of like apparently the left side of the table is the better side oh i think
audience reviews and critic reviews would be pretty low he just said that the lowest thing
is it doesn't matter um and he just said that doesn't matter oh does it not matter oh oh that's
weird that's kind of weird fucking idiot because you brought it up but if it doesn't matter okay
i don't know why you bothered if it doesn't matter well he's saying people's upsetness doesn't
matter it's the ratings that matter i just want to remind you that this is one of the guys who
said that um it should that they should have put black people in kingdom come deliverance even
though it was trying to be a historical game because it was a video game and you press a to
jump well that's yeah that was one of that yeah we can't have come deliverance that was retarded
i look fun house they're entertaining when they play video games but when they like talk and have
to use their brains fucking stupid it doesn't matter it doesn't matter hbo's no line well
and that's the point uh they're they're making a television show and that's unfortunate
that's unfortunately the the sort of the world we live in oh no it's unfortunate but you brought
it up it was interesting that he said it was unfortunate that's just the world we live in
what argument what attire you argue with and like this was this was trying to make
obviously trying to make money but also trying to make a good product i thought they did both
a lot of people didn't oh oh okay wow it's like arguing with two different people in the same
person um then the next word is it thank god are we are we getting off of this no no so there's
three quotes from this podcast so that was the first one i thought was funny i only scanned
through i think there's a lot of tism in here but i i only scanned through like i said so i
haven't caught all of them but i know someone wanted a couple people wanted us to cover this
i just it's just fun to laugh to be satisfied this was something that i sort of asked that
on twitter uh and why not just stop watching the show if it's so bad just stop watching uh
that's one of the things okay all right so wow because we care you are just so ridiculously
stupid it boggles the mind so i i just it's literally a little baffling how fucking stupid
this man is all right so you're watching a show for eight years of your life three episode nine
three episodes away from the finish of the whole thing and you're just like oh just stop watching
just you know like just stop just stop watching you haven't invested nine years of your life into
it did you just walk away just walk away pretty simple stop watching i like that we wanted it to
end well we wanted it to have a good ending because we were like actually excited for it
even after the bad we were like if they can just make a good ending i'll feel like it's worth it
and they didn't so now i feel like i wasted years of my life being invested in this
in this idea that if you don't like it is like so okay what you're saying is it's better if they
just completely stopped watching than it is for them to watch and point out what they think is
bad about it like which of those is really worse like like don't say bad things about it
just stop watching it just completely abandoned your investment your nine-year investment abandon
it get rid of it just don't say mean things and it's not even mean things necessarily it's
just pointing out the obvious criticism i last season i agree right that don wasn't allowed to
just right now i agree um people complained about it a lot and i actually i why was like but why
why go through this why push yourselves through another whole season another two years of pain i
know a lot of people liked episode one and two yeah the idea that they jumped into the season to
hate it isn't even fair but okay what's your job um yeah i do i have a better one about curiosity
like i mean i i'm curious whenever i was angry after episode three my point is that i'm now dead
inside i don't feel anger but i also i agree with that just dead inside that one seems to be the
only one with the brain it would be insane for me to not watch it at all it would be like watching
like five movies and then being like it just feels crazy to do that like if even especially
since we knew for a fact that season like with the walking dead i don't know when that's going to end
and keep watching that i quit after like season seven because i was like this is awful but with
game of thrones it's like season eight and they're like this is going to be the last i made it this
far yeah it's like imagine imagine we have a concept for you like we watched lord of the
rings trilogy right imagine we got to the last 30 minutes and oh it got really it's like all of a
sudden it got really bad right we got through eleven and a half hours or whatever and then at
the very last half hour you know we didn't like the way that some of the characters were treated
at the very end so we just turned it off and we didn't just we didn't finish through with it we
didn't finish the last movie we just said nope i just not going to watch the end i'm just going
to walk away because stuff happened that i didn't like i'm just gonna boop blocked you're blocked
i'm not watching it i don't want to hear it anymore ridiculous it's a nine book series i'm
gonna be like well i did seven so let's just get the whole way see that's that is but i'm also not
angry that's and that's also not upsetting me no yeah that's true you're not angry but i think
people that are that are yeah yeah did you see that like you and it doesn't like you either
she rescued him from his own point she changed his own goal posts like just to help him out
and he was like oh thank god yeah if you're angry already like why why make yourself angry
there you go that was my point is bruce the guy in the back right think so i have no idea bruce
needs whenever like before you say something right like in defense of something or to attack
something imagine as you're saying it like what would be the obvious rebuttal or the most common
rebuttal to what i'm going to say what would it be like i should be prepared when i make an argument
for what the other side might say against it and if what they might say against it is true
maybe i shouldn't say this thing bruce i don't think he fell that far ahead i don't think that
he thought at all i don't think he ever thinks no he's not he's not a he's not a thinker type
this is not the first tism that he's had i've lost or angry about it one um and this is something
again i've seen a lot on the internet people are saying benny often whites just wanted to move on
to star wars they got star wars and they're like we're done with this show that's not true at all
they've been saying this for is it not five years now but they wanted the show to end wait for after
seven seasons and hbo has pulled another season out of them i think it was supposed to be more
episodes though um i mean either way even she's like you're wrong she's proved him wrong immediately
and he was like uh either way or bruce poor bruce is so just fundamentally stupid i just feel like
i should help him out like like a retort at the bottom of the staircase you know
i feel like if they wanted to leave the show if they didn't care about the show anymore
then they should have gone to hbo and said man we don't want to do the show anymore we're done
we're finished we don't think we can do the characters justice the story goes past what
we want to do with it you guys need to hire somebody else you need to bring in consultants
because we're just we're not in this anymore we're done instead of saying we hate it and it's awful
and we're going to do a terrible job but we're just going to do it anyway
because there's no there's no principle there you know there's no love of the craft in there
yeah their egos are way too far up their own bums to assume that they wouldn't give the
characters justice as far as dnd are concerned they nailed it
in a way they kind of did seven seasons because of the you can say i mean one combined dnd said
we always thought it would 73 episodes it's like where in the fuck did you pull that pull that 73
where did you get such a random number they actually could respond to it as one combined
six and six right i think it was seven and six seven and six so that's to be an extra long season
and that's that's sort of the thing that i wanted to sort of point out is that they didn't they've
been trying to make this a sort of a complete story from the very beginning and they knew it
was going to be like benny off says we always believed where did you pull that
sorry exactly it's like you hear that quote and it's like how could you possibly believe that
it like it like jumped me so i gotta make sure the chat here otherwise i don't know what we
responded to and they knew it was going to be like also also this guy this guy in the the front right
he's silent totally said said he'd said anything he's just absorbing all of this listen to the
people on the other side of the table the guy next to you doesn't know what the fuck he's talking
about about any never listened to him yeah so about anything um about 73 hours um and a lot of
people we had to think it's very specific well a lot of people were like they're bullshitting
they're bullshitting and i was like i don't like they are so they they called but it would be a 73
hour show from very early on just like what 73 hours i mean i i bruce i get it cognitive thought
is not your forte but seriously how could you hear that quote and think to yourself yep that makes
sense 73 hours 73 hours i just like the i love the idea that they wrote down all the character
plots they just looked at it as a big whole thing they were like 71 two three four four three 73
that'll be it 75 would make more sense 73 73 just makes you wonder like how do they get to that
oh my god you're an idiot bruce um but yeah like uh i got said that a few times and i was just
checking out i was just like god and then i checked the like dislike i don't know if you guys have
seen it but it's not good oh let me see let me see please tell me it's super low 4.3 to 6.3
that's not good enough i'm gonna add my dislike to fuck it that's that's pretty that's actually
pretty impressive considering that they're 1.6 million subs that they could it's hard you have
to really fuck up to get a negative ratio on a video like you have to really like that's hard to
do that's why on um like vid iq and stuff all the stats they stopped going green after so what's
someone said 73 is his high key
so um for this next one i decided to just bump it up quickly because i know
curiosity is just getting to it now it's a podcast cool with riffing with bobby lee episode 32
i have no idea it's watched to a degree um i think it's got 100 000 views so it's definitely
watched um and yeah there's a there's a name drop for wolf in here and it's very very strange
because uh i was sent this and i saw it and i was like oh okay i'll just i'll let you see
it first well if you can get your uh i'm guessing they didn't like it and after every take they're
like yeah they give you notes yeah a little faster or we didn't really feel when you say
this like you know and then you do exactly what they tell you to do and then you go to the premiere
you're excited yeah and then all of a sudden you're to blame the right for a bad movie and
it's like it's like no i of an all around bad movie by the way right and then you can she's
just a portion of it she's getting lynched yeah they talk about tlj by the way right it's it's
not fair yeah it wasn't fair at all and i think and i know that because i've been watching reviews
on youtube right this guy named dishonored wolf you know i mean he calls her fat asian bitch
wow you got the it dropped by bobby wow
i like i like the degree of upset yes he's like he called her fat asian bitch
can it what's so weird is that bobby lee is a comedian let's go through all the things that
you've called people like that like one of the one of the things that frustrates me
to no end are comedians getting morally outraged at other people's jokes
like how do you have any kind of ground to stand on
i was wondering if he was going to talk about game of thrones and i was like what
take are you gonna say for that because i didn't blame any actors in his review oh my god like
really harsh i know it's a white dude saying it because you can tell right it's fucking terrible
especially when that's copy written for your mom you know what i mean wow that was so funny that
literally only you left at it even even the asian dude like bobby lee how come you're not
getting upset how do you not do you not get why this is actually kind of hilarious the guy
literally used the joke against him the second after he was morally outraged by it so it just
puts him in a position where he's like dude i just made my position clear on it and now you're trying
to get me to laugh along with you about the joke i was just watching this i was like just destroyed
everything about your argument immediately wait i'm sorry i was in a different world especially
when that's copy written for your mom you know what i mean the guy just basically said your mom
is a fat asian bitch look at the guy's face yeah i like the i like the fat guy yeah i mean this is
what i mean he's clearly on our team he enjoys this guy oh my god dude someone in the chat said
who's indian mario indian mario i love you i did mario indian mario yeah just so i'll play it all in
fold out what just watch it wasn't fair how he delivers the thing that the guy is like oh that's
so bad but then he just reflects the joke immediately oh and i think and i know that
because i've been watching reviews on youtube right this guy named dishonored wolf you know
what i mean thank you he calls her fat asian bitch in his review oh my god like really harsh
i know it's it's a white dude saying it because you can tell right it's fucking terrible especially
when that's copy written for your mom you know what i mean
yeah
duh
and he's like oh yeah you do that shit to me all the time yeah i'm like you do that shit
to me all the time but i totally agree he's like this other guy's just fucking spineless
so hold on i'm not really familiar with these guys who's the one that runs this podcast i have
no idea one that i like or it's it's indian mario i i hope indian mario's the one that runs
because he's i like him he's making me laugh
yeah that's that that's like i was just like what a bizarre okay um right so again because
we're on a podcast roll right now so um have you guys heard anything about about collider recently
i've only heard of it i don't really oh yeah right okay so collider are the people that
read let me do make fun of a lot for essentially being the most shill like podcast there is for
star wars they're basically just like everything that is new that comes out of star wars is great
uh they have loads of like merchandise they always talk about amazing everything is and um
the guy who's like one of the main people there is pissed off because disney didn't invite him
to i guess the star wars um celebration and then he asked them to specifically and he
didn't get a reply and he's really pissed about that pissed to the point where he doesn't want
to shill for the uh star wars oh i'm glad that you learned your lesson i know right i can't
believe that he stopped shilling for them after he wouldn't get involved well it's not that simple
though is it because the thing is when you're a paid shill you can't go off script you'll get in
trouble and so this this thing has been going viral and it's hilarious because yeah just so
just watch what happens well i mean at the time again yeah so the the angry dude is on the right
and then the others are just listening to him and getting increasingly concerned because all of them
are paid to be here as far as i understand it was we already had it we we had our show we book out
our show a couple weeks in advance and i didn't even know so doreen is coming on today because
then i had to leave early and schedules and stuff too and i don't even know if christina is in i
don't think she's in l.a i think she came in i don't even know where she is i know you've admitted
to it being but her but i still think christian like if you not that you're asking my opinion
but i'm gonna give it because i guess that's why i'm sitting here i still think you should do your
part of doing your job and talk about it yeah but i and i'm gonna be stubborn and say i don't want
to okay um i and i don't you're going to though what's that you're going to i don't want to uh no
because it's our coverage uh haley's got a lot of really good interviews with imagineers uh that
she's gonna be so first of all first of all i don't want you to do that on the air you can call
me in afterwards so you know what so then someone else wants to show her there so like fistable oh
so that guy's like a manager of some kind and he's basically like oh you're doing it
guys like i don't want to do it first of all don't do this live guys like this is the worst
thing you could ever do this is like a repeat of the dusty and creationist cat podcast that failed
after one episode let's just air this out let's air out all of our dirty laundry live and we're both
we're both fucking idiot retard but you knew as dusty and creationist cat and yeah just for
clarification chat probably knows more about this than i do i only know about this from vague
context you'll never catch me watching collider and ironically someone else supposed to show today
you don't have the second time you've done this the first time you've done this you burst in the
door you burst in the door screamed at us because we played the youtube video we didn't know it that
was the first time i went in i went in to let you know that you have been taking off the air already
i know but you screamed at us for it i didn't scream you didn't roxy did he yell at us i said hey
yeah all these just keep it out of the faces of these other three people because they're just
like what the fuck is happening i'm on it man roxy did he yell at us uh there's a clip i it's it's
the answer is yes you yelled at us and you embarrassed us in front of kate mulligan who
was sitting here too if you want to do this on the air doing the air would much rather you did
you you you started this on the air you brought you you you started the show by saying you're not
going to talk about it on jedi council which is your show okay but you're not the producer of it
and i am actually i am actually yes i am i'm actually that was the deal i made with fernanda
is i'm also just the same way you didn't know the same way you did the same
oh god everyone's like
still i are live everyone's telling me the ori trailer is playing at the moment at e3
oh watch it later yeah we can watch it later yeah someone will upload it by the time that
we're still doing this so we can watch it it was the fucking head of the bell reaction absolutely
yeah well all of us are reaction i mean me and you definitely invested rags you do you like ori i forget
fuck animals there you go one point ahead of content do you oh i think you just had a development
i walk into fernanda's i go can you clear it up content and development to which now is not the
case you are and i get it but i first of all if you want to do this on the air we do it on the
air but i am not but i am absolutely not talking about it today you can have roka hosted how about
that i mean if you don't want to host the show because i don't want to oh i'm so sorry you didn't
get to go last night you're welcome see you can if you want to do this again we can do it all the
only because you you had the same thing and what people also don't realize with you you act you act
hot-headed you act all the time what do you even do if you were a guest on this show you'd be like
i was i mean i know that i'd be i'd be i'm being recorded so i just i just stand there i just be
like dead-eyed i just pulled my photo i'd be like right to do it stare right at the camera you just
not move a muscle just sit there and smile you look at the girl on the left like she's
like going out of her way not to look at him she's like i just don't want to be this is how
you lose your jaw screaming yellow people but you want to do it now we can do it now you don't want
to cover colliders content is what you're just saying on on collider live the show's called
collider live right it's called collider live and it's called collider jedi council and there's a
lot of really good well maybe we should change that maybe we'll change that and we'll and we'll
have other really really good coverage that colliders doing from oh my god why didn't they
cut the stream i know that's the obvious fucking choice they've taken this down obviously um but
everybody's still covered so it's hilarious and it's a look into like it's not fun to have your
opinions bought for you really not fun especially when you actually want to make some form of a
stand now i actually think that his stand is kind of childish they didn't invite me it's like okay
oh yeah it's really stupid but christ and he's like that's it i don't want to do the thing and
then it's like no you have to do the thing it's what your job is it's like oh i don't want to
cover it at all that's just really bizarre okay good there's blue milk and there's people dressed
in costumes that's it all right moving on oh all right so next you want to still talk about this
catch me outside how about that which i was really appreciative in that
but i just don't what what is it that girl went on dr phil catch me outside i just don't
understand why but why do that on the air why do that in here why would you start this on the
air because you've been having a conversation with me after words and say to me hey i wish you
do you see she tried to rescue it she was like oh it was cool that you said this thing that he
brought it back and it's like okay you wouldn't have done that you want to come on the same way
because i didn't call you out when you came in you're embarrassed us in front of kate mulligan
she's sitting there and he's kate mulligan like oh my god no idea apparently this has happened before
shaking the black over there black hair maybe oh it could be yeah so so our producer here at efap
has never ever on air while we're live in our studio and this never happened to us we're very
professional um we're talking about our producer pretty sure he's the manager of efap i'm not sure
we're talking about the producer the one who produces different things what i mean
the one who produces the cash money that keeps the studio lights on you know who pays the
the property taxes which is where they get you by the way
bayouin says wow i wasn't invited to tell me birthday party i don't want to do my job frank
you're 35 you're job this is really awkward god is this the way they do business that was
embarrassing this is why this is why i'm very very very very very picky about sponsorships
and i have to know all this shit beforehand that's why i like the white with the watch thing
i knew everything going beforehand i've got this watch next to me right now i'm gonna wear it
tonight i'll be wearing it tonight and i gotta be like you can't enter into these contracts
with these sponsorships where you have to chill because shit like this is like well now i can't
be genuine about how i feel so well now i feel like a piece of shit because i'm saying things
i don't really mean and fuck like this is the thing it does suck to have to say whether or not
you approve of a thing you want to promote a thing when you actually don't want this is what
this comes down to he feels cheated by the star wars brand and thus does not want to promote
a star wars thing but he has no choice you're kidding me or he isn't releasing until february
11th of next year oh hey well that's the day before that's the day before my birthday you can
see as a birthday present let's just hope it's good let's just hope it's good oh well i mean i
don't have to have all that fun no you don't have all that birthday money you'll spend that on my
present no i don't doubt that it will be good it's just like no i don't have any money because
my sponsorship with game of thrones was tragically cut short i guess doom eternal is really the only
thing i have to well that and uh well is cyberpunk coming out this year or i don't know i don't know
doom eternal's coming out this year otherwise it's like
look now it's okay dude it's okay it's gonna be even better than you i mean i'm not really mad
obviously i mean i i wanted to take their time and it's been because the first game released in 2015
then the uh dlc uh definitive edition that came out a year later so it's been i mean that'll
have been four years of development time if we're going like right after the definitive edition
came out so that's a good long while still disappointed though a long while bad i agree
with that that's human more crying though i mean you're the day i didn't even say it and mention
it and talk about it but you do that because you knew that we got a that we got a strike on the
we didn't know that we had no idea that though just the audio cyberpunk was postponed to 2020 god
damn it sorry so it's really only doom eternal this year then yay well that's the thing like
i that's the e3 like people say what do you think about e3 is like i don't
shit e3 like i i don't i don't know if i could stress how little i care about e3
because i've there's been all these games that get trailed out throughout the year
you know like like the love the games i i've been reviewing like the plague tale is great void
bastards is great you have all these games that come out throughout the year and so they're
fantastic and e3 steals your attention away from a lot of these gems
there's some fun memes on twitter i'm looking forward to showing
there's someone who's already made a meme for the fucking ash robot queen that we had in the opening
minute of the show i i failed to check my twitter in time that's why i didn't know about these okay
that's exactly what that does yeah but same way reactions when you sit down and you do reactions
like when we'll reject do it when we do it we play video over it and it doesn't ever get strikes
it just gets the demonetization no it does when you live stream and i've said that a thousand
never to me yeah no no i told i've told everyone on the show never to me i've never heard that
we're not letting you know explicitly that that was a bad idea but it wasn't a matter
but what i'm telling you the guy's face
and the the the chick sitting across from him did that thing with the lips
that white people do where they kind of bite their lips a little bit when you come in just
trying to contain that day if you would have come here passing the phone but here look at this
i like to imagine that they're just looking at me it's a dick butt up there
see we're shut down we're done oh my god we all know we all know how how that door
slams open that had nothing to do with my tone okay all right talking about the mechanics of
the door opening right now is what we're doing i'm looking forward to hearing you guys talk about
galaxy's edge and all of colliders really good content so you you can host it you can host the
show now you just do what we ask you to do what we ask you to do oh you are our employee
oh man you are our employee because this is the thing we tell you to pay you this is how this
arrangement works like me wolf rags obviously like geeks and gamers nidrotic all those channels
every one of them you have to do whatever the fuck you want say whatever the fuck you want
anything we want change your mind in a in in the moment you don't have to cover what you
don't want to cover it's all brilliant but this guy is just like no you'll cover what we tell you
too he's like oh you hosting that show why do you think cody's doing with the cameras right now i
think that's it though but yeah um so that's pretty embarrassing huh
yeah i'm glad that we don't have anything like that here on arts and red letter media just put
out a video of rich evans laughing at this like that's all it is he's just laughing at watching
and it's because apparently they keep an eye on them because nerd crew is based entirely on
collider as far as i can tell yeah i mean look at the comments for this video it's all like red
letter media stuff yeah it just confirms everything they're just shilled to fucking
the fact that they instilled a sub semblance of a soul in some of their workers it's like oh
oh they think they have a soul yeah this this will be quick and i suppose it's just because
i don't even what can we say about this that hasn't been said but i feel like
i kind of have to say something change the name to x women's
oh my god look at the quality of those awful suits they look terrible no i can't wait to see
this movie tonight me and my friend are so excited just to laugh at it i mean i wasn't
laughing much at all that was actually kind of a disappointment part for me honestly what with uh
king of the monsters i didn't know no the x-men and bigger risks and for what please
tell me it's not your ego oh my god look at her acting yeah i've never been a fan of her
as mystique she is not a good actress president you like it don't you we're supposed to be
hunted and despised well you know actually i do and then you go okay have a way macavoy sorry
opposite her who's like one of the best actors around right now he's like i can't wait to see
him in it he's fucking he's like he there's no role he can't take which is really cool
really good character actors like why would you put those two in a room why would you do that
it's all just a means to an end raven what end is that keeping us safe you should understand
better than anyone that we're only ever one bad day away from them starting to see us as the enemy
you never know with this stuff macavoy is a god this is true i really liked him in split and then
and then i mean he was good in glass so what we wear matching costumes and smile and pictures
to pay for keeping the peace by risking our people to save the cool costumes they had and
apocalypse at the end too cool i don't know yes they just scrap them and think they didn't need
them anymore then they were like oh i guess we need to make new ones it's funny i can't
actually remember the last time you were the one risking something um um he's in a wheelchair
so he took like there was a joke in the fucking comment section that his response to that would
be picks up one of his legs like a wet noodle and like how you know you're standing there
telling me this second comment she sounds more like an ex-wife he literally gets shot
and loses his ability to walk unless yeah that's like one of the top comics off his powers i mean
come on i'm not even a big x-med fan and i know this eddie professor x can't walk lost his bestie
to differing opinions well to construct a school for helping mutants and creates a team to help
protect humanity and that bitch has the audacity to say it's funny i can't remember the last time
you're the one risking something well this movie tanked yes and by the way the women are always
saving the men around here you might want to think about changing the name to ex-women
oh um um oh you changed it again
again there's not much to say about it that hasn't already been said it's such a cringe line
it's not even delivered well for what it is and it doesn't even make sense the um the event that
takes place that makes you say that is because gene gray does the most significant saving in
in the in the event that took place previously to this scene however night crawler and quicksilver
are the second two most significant by far they're both guys have like a scene like the
last couple movies that's at least mildly entertaining no i'm so sorry but he gets taken
out of the movie like in the first 15 minutes you're kidding me not like dead even though
technically me saying that as a spoiler but you don't see him until right at the end then and
then it's just for him to say hello dude he was like the only redeeming like the quicksilver
scene in apocalypse is literally the only to see that movie it's weird really just looking up on
youtube i don't get why they made that choice but yeah that's happened yeah once you see it we'll
be able to talk about it on the next defap as being a pretty poop movie um yeah so the next
video is pretty depressing to be honest it's tough for us to go through but we got to do it
it's important for journalistic purposes but hold look oh my god hold on hold on don't play it yet
don't play it yet oh god look how hey what's up guys i've got a television set right behind me
uh right now we have a lot ready from my brain so you need to crop it so the face fills up the
thing if you can i know but i well i uninstalled i uninstalled uh photoshop so i i can't
this will have to do just do it with like you could do it the old-fashioned way it doesn't
matter anyway so this video is him explaining like what he thinks about a video game something
about something else and then he's explaining his potential futures in cyberpunk that's kind of
that's cool he's explaining his potential future on youtube the other thing i wanted to talk about
is why i haven't been making that many videos i've gotten a lot of emails and tweets and stuff like
that where the hell are you man why have you only made five videos the last two months well
truth be told this is going to surprise some people but i'm actually currently looking
to go back into the workplace and i'm looking for a job no i'm too busy trying to figure out
what's happening in this clip he's total total is he thinking about going back into the workplace
yeah i'm like well i mean release better content that more people enjoy or else you'll have to do
that excuse you excuse you rags who makes better content than totaled maybe the dog no it's not
it's not necessarily uh that needs to be no it does need to be better it's i i fear that
i fear that perhaps his hidden brilliance is lost on the plebs so they don't appreciate fully
just what it is that he does we've got a chat full of people appreciate to get here i don't
understand what's stopping him i don't i appreciate it i appreciate it this isn't about me no i set
a full set up a kill for me hey all the tonaled bills myself you can offer that
old donathan replaced we can't wait we've already lost enough meetings we can't i quit my job about
october 2017 to start this youtube channel so we're coming up on the two-year anniversary
i wanted to make a youtube channel because i was really passionate about video games and i had
always been shot your buddy and i felt myself very stuck in corporate america with the suit
and tie on and carrying what is this clip you you had a clip of you shooting your teammate in the
back and then you die what is the point of this video game clip he was stuck in corporate america
he had a briefcase of the suit i was stuck in corporate america much like i was stuck shooting
my teammate and then stuck in limbo between dying and respawning in this video game
we need to contact daddled to get him to yeah we need to get daddled to give him some inspiration
very unhappy my position was essentially compensation finance and i got into the
corporate world after getting my nba and an undergrad in economics which is why you guys
see me talk about numbers and stocks sometimes because that's kind of my background yes
we're familiar with your with your number but i got into the industry
on youtube after quitting my job and it was it was actually quite the chance you know it was
very risky at the time it was quite the chance yeah i believe i can believe it i believe it
was quite the chance uh you know i was one of the first people out there to do like
controversial style video essays fuck you no you were not you lying fucking piece of shit
how dare you say i'll be to other people this is how dare you i i literally i know this is weird
timing but i actually have to take a shit right now so you will listen to what he just said in
slowneld yeah talk yeah go turn on slowneld and i'm gonna go outside there's actually quite
the chance you know it's very risky at the time
ah total broke new crap
you know i was one of the first people out there to do like controversial style
video essays controversial style video essays what do you think he means like that
i have absolutely no idea
controversial style that's a style i mean is he just saying when he when he does clickbait maybe
you're being an edgelord and trying to be exempt against what everyone else thinks but christ
oh my god since then there's been a lot of people who have come around and there's been a lot just
just like the video probably that's a real quote from the chat just because it's bad doesn't mean
it's bad oh also someone sent in a super chat about orie being available only being available
as an epic exclusive the description of the video actually says it's going to be on windows
tenants team so yeah okay it's gonna wait is it a timed exclusive for what for orie going on epic
or have they just invented that no no no no he said he was saying um watch it be an epic exclusive
but the description of the video says it will be on windows tennis team the gods of godly
openness but then again they could still do it you know they better fucking not
good game industry i talked about the game industry oh jesus christ actually let me look
it up on here come around and maybe i can pre-order it before it goes off just like the video game
talking about well like with metro exodus i pre-ordered it so i still
theme even though no one else does so i'll probably do the same thing with me just in case
yeah that's fine i have every bit of confidence great
you definitely have to watch the trailer
since then there's been a lot of people who have come around and there's been a lot just
just like the video game industry that delivery is fantastic he sounds drunk but all the time
there's been a lot of increased competition for people with talent so it's been increasingly
difficult increasingly increasingly did he say that yeah he said it before too
i know that he said that in another video for youtube so it's been increasingly difficult
to stand out oh total never change just keep mispronouncing everything
increasingly increasingly and you know what like i feel bad where i'm like dude
if you're finding it hard to stand out when you got a head start it probably means that you're
not offering anything like except a weird obscure podcast listening to you as if you're a god
god we need to reach out to him get him on the show because as long as he how we've covered him
over the past year i think we'll be fine and create consistent income especially because i'm
not the most uh dramatic
person on youtube returned i like to keep a chill on this channel and just share my opinion
so i keep the chill and sometimes that's not good enough especially when there's been a
surgeons of a surgeons surgeons surgeons is that a thing would you say a series race
it would well it depends on the context of how he's saying it we'd answer it listen sentence
because they're because because he could mean a surge or a resurgence depending on how the sentence
goes he's combined that could have meant one of multiple correct things but instead of
new style youtubers license no video shadow play icon new style youtubers
there's been a surgeons of new style youtubers that is true
surgeons i like it discussion style youtubers just popping up all over the place
so it's been tough to stand out stand out someone said surgeon you know what you you stand out
tonaled you do nobody like you buddy surgeons i like the several people yes it was a surgeon
i don't think that's the surgeon total the second age of new style
can we get shawn b on efap yeah definitely let's do it my channel to essentially devolve into
is inconsistent income and for a guy that needs a certain amount of income to live
so it's led to inconsistent income and he's a guy who needs an amount of income
and else you know we gotta pay our rent we gotta say for retirement it's maybe just not
in the cards for me anymore oh in terms of putting out full-time youtube videos
it's just not there's just not enough money anymore so that's it guys it's just not enough
money there's not enough money all right i'm looking to go back to work and what that
means if i get a full-time job is
content on downward thrust may be incredible turn off your shadow play notification maybe yeah
that's one of the first things i've that you do you so that at the end of every all your clips
it don't have those things coming out last one minute 30 seconds save kill save things
save moment done recording why would you why would you ask that of tonal what is wrong with you
was tonal put out like put out good content that's a complicated question
it's certainly it's it's it's going to my patreon account which i'll link in the description all
right i want to see is patreon how is tonal's patreon i'll look it up here we go patreon.com
slash tonal patreon oh that's that ain't good what does he know he's uh got 64 patrons he's
making 184 a month yeah on 300 000 plus subscribers that's interesting i mean i i don't mean to
brag or nothing right but i mean i i later okay so that was easy also um i think that i think
that happens when you have a few really big hits with the kids you know and they all subscribe
and then you have the stuff you know you're all your non-hits in between the actual good stuff
you know there's no consistency in the view counts or the reception to the stuff so people subscribe
and then they just sort of forget you're around or they don't really like you quite enough to give
you any money because you don't put out consistently good stuff there's a lot of stuff that goes into
it but i'd wager that's probably probably why i mean his views don't get that many his videos
don't get that many views he just had you know those couple big big viral hits every once in a
while and people sub for those but they're few and far between yeah unfortunately the efap audience
can't float mr tonald i wish we could listen if every we have 2,800 people watching if every one
of you gave a hundred dollars to tonald that would be i mean wow such a tiny just such a tiny
thing for 2,800 people to do just a hundred dollars each and he would be wow what a show
that would be what a display tonald you have to remember dsp gaming is still around he's still
successful and he's married he's married if you think if you think that there's no woman out there
for you just remember that dsp gaming has like a moderately attractive wife and hey there's nothing
wrong with moderately attractive in fact you should probably aim for moderately attractive
don't aim for ugly not announce my patreon publicly on this channel in a dedicated video i
mentioned it at once this is great footage i really this is yeah this is awesome footage
one time like last year um i just think it's very tacky to put up a video asking you fucked it up by
itself with that without you fucked it up and you kept it in your video you fucked your finish your
thing up yeah well and you kept it in the video you know whenever i'm playing games and i do
something great or something cool or interesting i alt f10 and it saves the clip so when i never
what i need to put footage of games and stuff of videos you know give people something to look at
you have me like wrecking shit and the cool stuff's happening like oh you took on a whole
squad in apex or oh you got a big kill streak in mordhau or you did something some funny happen
i'm not gonna be like no i fucked up let's save that to show the world he's a humble man he likes
to let people know that even the great humble i agree he is so i haven't actually done it if you
guys want to support me the best ways on patreon i don't have a big patreon following most creators
uh we rely on youtube ad revenue plus patreon you know minus taxes of course that little gap
where he was like his brain was like you have to say a third thing he's like but there is no third
thing he's having a conversation with his brain yeah that's what the cap was then you hear you
hear him go big page on slowneldat yeah listen for the yeah it's the best thing ever following
most creators uh we rely on youtube ad revenue plus patreon
you know minus taxes of course yeah you know minus taxes minus taxes because you know you
you pay taxes let me explain to you what taxes i'm sorry i can't get over the
you know like he just agrees with himself like you know to make a living and um since i didn't
announce my patreon it's quite small so if you're out there and you're wanting to maybe see this
channel go back to full time you can go there and help me out but currently right now i'm looking
to get a job currently currently right now as opposed to currently later currently later god
that's like when review tech usa says also two makes me want to like claw my ears out every time
also too as well no in addition it's rich there's synonyms i just can't live on youtube anymore
um it just doesn't seem to be possible it's for the small massive you know i started this channel
oh
play that again play that again you know i started this channel
wow
and it was very hard at one point i got my breakout video going featuring for honor and battlefield
and since then we've been growing there's been a little bit of stagnation you know there's a lot
of seasonality and a little bit but for the most part seasonality i'm really proud of our uh
community at times you know youtube can be fairly toxic there's a lot of people out there
that just like to cry and whine but what for the most part what is this video what is this video
there's a lot of people who like to cry and whine what this video is about no i gotta get a job
stagnation like okay you know there's a lot of seasonality on youtube season but for the most
parts i'm really proud of our uh community at times you know youtube can be fairly toxic
and there's a lot of people out there that just like to cry and whine but you know for the most
part i think the discussion we have on this channel is good and although i've made some
bad videos and some ones i look back on and think what the hell was i thinking
oh
that's gonna be great for kendel sometimes i look back on my videos and think what the hell is i
thinking
for the most part i'm really proud of my work and anyone who watches my content i really appreciate
it well always so i'm looking to go back to work that's just how it is the cosmic
though i've got an idea for a brand new video format that i'm going yeah how many times have
you said this channel this is this like the seventh or eighth time you said you're going
to change your content fall if not in your format 2019 all right so the end of this year
i need to figure out how i'm going to do it but it's basically gonna combine my two passions in
life one of them obviously gaming i'm not gonna say what the other one is but let's just say
it's going to be unlike anything you've ever seen on youtube period okay i am ready
so is he playing is he finding a bot here i don't know they don't seem to be doing much of anything
look forward for that otherwise i'm going to be releasing content at my own schedule currently
as i look for a new job i don't want to okay go back what tonal i don't even play mortal combat
and what are you doing here isn't this like the point where you're supposed to deliver the
fatality when he's stunned and we're not yeah he fucked up earlier and he just said whatever
i'll put that clip in the video i have a feeling he's not gonna nail this one either well that's
the thing you're playing you got you're playing against like a bot or something surely or or
an autist something but essentially playing against a vegetable or a practice robot and you
fuck it up still and you're like you know instead of me trying that again i'll just save that clip
of me fucking up because i just need for i just need to pad it out also i have no idea why people
aren't watching my videos you do full time but you did fatality the revenue is just not there
you let the fate okay the whole thing that's fun about mortal combat is that the fatalities are
he disagrees with his channel is getting a fatality yes there's as many videos as i possibly
can i'm still trying to find the best way to present content on this channel it's been an
ongoing the discovery
for me
oh i think we need to pull it back a bit i think rags why wouldn't he just
grab a different he's only got this for a minute just pull a part of it that's not
terrible i'm going to be releasing content at my own schedule currently as i look for a new job
i don't want to and i'm still oh wow i just got yanked around buffering it's at 1543 here in a
second that's way to present content on you on 1525 1525 yeah this channel it's been an ongoing
let me reload reloading yeah we'll reload the child with the cosmic chicken all right we are
1528 yep every all right for me to yeah do i want to do what is this clip do i want to do what
is this discussion do i want to do what are you doing to him do i want to do video essays
guys you're playing with the controller what do i want to do on this channel what are you doing
just basically everything what are you doing i'm not even listening to him the little dip that he
does into the water that's so great he's just like i'm gonna just jump in the water i'm still trying
to work towards my preferred method you guys you guys have uh you know a preference on what kind
of content you like on this channel you can drop it down below in the comment section and of course
they give me your constructive feedback if i was gonna get footage for any game i would do
something more action-packed rather than walking in water and trying to find the right side of the
boat to go to with the witcher you've got two options combat and then pumping the graphics up
and just doing going through the countryside looking at how beautiful it is but not this
you're fucking up driving a boat thank you guys for supporting me for so all right where's he
gonna go anyone out there that hasn't seen this is where you could begin you could start the clip
with this and you just sail it out and you have the camera look around and i hope to god he like
crashes or some like one of the i don't know drowners or whatever like just rip him apart
and he dies constant over the past two years how do you make the witcher look bad because
it's been a crazy ride and uh i wouldn't take it back for anything hope you guys have a great day
i'll see you guys hopefully very soon take care until then okay hold on hold on look at the
objective look at the objective marker it's pointing in the exact opposite direction no
the objective is listen the clip makes sense he was struggling and fucking up with the horse
and the water and the boat but now he has found his way he is steering his ship now he is setting
off into the horizon on this lake his this channel is like his new boat he is setting sail
he is going forward he's leaving his horse and his crap driving behind him and he is moving on
this it all makes perfect sense just a way for maybe he's going to go the long way to the
objective marker going to go around the entire world and it is a visual metaphor also i didn't
pay attention to anything he said in that last section oh i didn't either i was so taken with
the gameplay how do you make the witcher story look bad i want to see that little dippy does
you're reaching rags yeah i'm a lawyer i want to do discussion do i want to do
you know webcam do i want to do video essays what do i want to do on this channel i'm still
loading i'm still at 1532 i'm still trying to work towards my preferred method i don't know
what's happening with my content to you guys i mean it's all right we're good so yeah it was
sad news there was a beach around that little dip he could just considering leaving youtube
or at least slowing down youtube to pursue a um a job of some kind and good god tony don't
don't do this to us you're the best thing ever who's tony i mean i'm calling this is an interesting
headline man found with 21 severed vaginas in his freezer oh okay all right he just scooped
those bitches right out didn't he all right okay jeffrey domer okay um let's not talk about
it is to be fair it is not known if the women survive the uh wouldn't a lot of women be tuning
up without those parts i could have swore i left this vagina here yesterday right between my legs
down there so what's in the chat was like we found him florida man give those back man
is it from florida regs the court i don't know let me actually check because it's from florida okay

god and with that it is time we have two rounds of memes first is pictures second is videos all right
oh boy are we doing pictures or videos first is it rags we were talking about three he said pictures
well total bores me how dare you when all he does listen i i honestly did like the video
but the way this is what happens when you make the witcher look bad i just i start to zone out
a little bit and i and i just saw this headline and i was like hmm he kept an organized collection
of all the body parts he'd removed over the last nine years he's like all right well the man is
studious i'll give him that meme number one oh my god beautiful i love it that's great efap studios
yeah i get to be the the role model for the dawn in this movie i don't deserve anything like that but
i'm the producer but someone sent me this on twitter they were like oh my god he's and

it's amazing oh yeah this is a good one so you got the don looking in his mirror it's been a year now
since his wife's died since then i've done my best take care of our daughter and two adopted sons
then you got him at the charity sort of area i guess and he's like
she says thank you for donating to charity sir every little bit helps
he says just call me the don and you should smile more you look pretty cute
i've also donated to countless charities spreading a little bit of positivity everywhere i go
oh god i love it so good

if it's been shown before who's seen it specifically i just know there's no
oh no he's so you look so happy he's got a bandage on his hand yep just trying to be a good guy
the don no all we want is people to leave him alone this one's this one's from the
artist that makes weird things he's the one that drew that like garrod that was like
super like weird details and stuff but he can't deny that some of this is actually really good
work and i think it's a dawn story wake up ton oh becca becca oh no
welcome to pafe oh god dating students have been killed in an attack by the toxic brood in central
pafe he works in the train station in pafe is pafe is um like our alter naga yeah naga efap basically
we don't deserve dog he is so good and pure there's a lot of dog and he drew this by hand
this is all hand-drawn robert kasinski
oh we did it we did it i can't remember what the context of this is exactly but i like to think
it's when robert's got mod powers yeah that's what you banned me for 300 minutes i couldn't
for the rest of it and i modded you wolf i modded you should have fixed it well it lasted the entire
rest of the night so no it didn't it did i don't believe you at 300 seconds that's like six minutes
it lasted the entire night i don't know what to tell you your computer's broken no it was that
night that the chat stopped working for like 80 percent of it well then blame google that's
the dot abides non-alcoholic doesn't even drink alcohol i guess i guess i just need to start
making like all my icons put them on the discord so people can have they don't have to rip them
from anything they can get just the clean images i'll probably do that a 300-year span
oh my god regs is the woman
oh i love it that's awesome
oh my god alphabets the little fat midget
as long as he doesn't complain
we got another godzilla one
why aren't you talking about godzilla that's a new move do you hate women or something making
a video response to this hashtag i stand with don how about a smile for me huh let's put a smile
on that face that would be um battery i believe and assault it'll be both you'll be all that's a
threat oh yeah i don't know if wolfs i think you we've all seen this one before but it's worth
reposting oh i've seen this oh yeah that's great yeah that's what the indio that's really good
for er i don't think i don't think ea would have trouble surviving that
look at him he's still smiling
that's not a whole bayou and me it's true smiling is harassment blessed bayou and
i feel like posting this
yeah
oh it's beautiful that's great
this is a clone wars reference
i'm just a harasser sir i'm meant to be expendable not to me
yeah i really like that one that's so sweet that yeah this one i've had for ages uh this
is a part of the fact that yes jay is in law apparently our manager can i speak to the manager
of god oh she's got the haircut no no how did we decide that jay was the manager i have no idea
but it was a meme and it got put into several memes as well because this this style of drawing
was in the other one do you remember when we're all watching something on like a tv i'm rolling
oh yeah we were all watching tonaled then or no we were watching someone else and then we
started watching tonaled and everyone started cheering all right so this one set you another one
oh uh bayou and can you resend the three-wheeled raven i'll uh i'll put it on then because i've
seen that one it's good i'll be good yeah so you got the robotic embodiment of queen elizabeth
the second designed to keep her alive long after her natural form was destroyed
you got a little ash pile inside of me
may england live long long and prosper long live the queen of tron 9000
this i believe was a request from fucking ages ago and they like were watching an old
episode they were like i know this is old fuck it i can't remember what our request was but i
remember patrick william's aliens wow i don't remember the context of it but i love that oh yeah
this is another bayou meme that deserves reposting because it's wonderful oh yeah i see adorable
drawing oh no pet your doggo john don't kind of don john kind of fucked up don's fine don would
have paid the shit out of uh i didn't say don did i no i just oh again another classic godzilla one
pretty much the narrative okay yeah it just makes sense it just works
tfa part three will never come out let's see
all right who's this i'm not i can't remember who specifically uh said this on twitter collecting
these as a nightmare oh so oh god oh i got it it's it's just a spider looking into the
palantir looking for part three you got a rider dog at the bottom as well
oh it's beautiful to people who make art for this you're you're crazy but i love it and wonderful
and then yeah i can't believe people make art of the show this is a fresh off the presses meme
but rags will love it
need a ride
for the rags it just ends with rag
oh man he's on a bag it's just of course he is
um i can't remember if i showed this one but i wanted to make sure so it's a repo if it's a
repos is fine but um like the efap oh did we cover this before i can't remember i haven't seen it but
this looks nuts there you go it's not a button the tivity is just a button
i guess it's like the efap gauntlet that has lots of specifications you got i have tonaled
it looks like the i have tonaled summons artificial barriers of blockage
reduce the boil of eric bluffs reduces enemy movement to 0.5 speed
allows the user to rewind time in the event of an unsuccessful battle by cheating uh by chanting
my life did it fail this move can this this move can only be used once every 23 hours
oh my god at the bottom just sharp yeah that makes sense at the bottom it says uh oi wolf i
live 30 minutes away from the shire in new zealand and haven't seen the lord of the rings films i
also like pineapple on pizza how do i repent for my sins well never eat pineapple on pizza again
and watch the lord of the rings also go to the places because like i hear you can go to a lot
of the places they started filming the movie set and that would be awesome i want to do that one day
let's go that's the urban um yes let's go yeah let's go so yeah the sammy colon medallion of er
it uh gives user control of fire wind water and earth and temporarily revive an army of
ghost nazis as an assist will summon the pike screech which can result in heart failure of the
target not bad it's a death note reference i'm pretty sure uh monobrow shavings of quenton
um allows user to steal the soul of eddie parson who frequently ingest soy based food products
gives user ability to summon i hate everything who can himself summon the other members of
sardonic cast as an assist not bad too the boil of eric butts will reduce enemy cognitive function
by 97 wow that's pretty impressive results in enemies having an emotional breakdown of
the sight of movement even in the even even on what does that say even on um next fly or
level flying through a leaf even even a leaf flying through the breeze can cause a tear duct
to rupture we just have to zoom in um monobrow shavings of quinton uh semi colon medallion of er
yeah we're already we're we got a last two cosmic egg and mix of mix of rhino madea ghost and spider

or objectivity and kill those who follow them this is achieved by making an okay sign with all
of the gems i mean yeah so that's that's the tivity gauntlet i want to i'm wondering if
that was a combination of infinity and tism but um okay a wonderful piece of
why are we still talking about this peter man is coming out oh my god

because i'm a massive no he's just closer to the he's just closer to the
very stylized yeah it's awesome though it reminds me of super jail it reminds me of the
weird world you could go to in the simpsons game from like 2007 i want to say i don't know
when it came out but like a japanese world where things kind of look like this i don't know what
style this would be called but it's cool massive unit indeed

a lot um it goes out
efap has suffered severe casualties in the long no long men war
i hope you can count to 20 because that's how many efap went
i'm not sure that that's inherently that much of a that's a reference to game of thrones by the way
account to 23 yeah i know but count the 28
carols flat i mean as a character is that like a personal attack
the eyes it was rhino milk spider spider mode objectivity it just wasn't
now the remaining survivors are desperately trying to stay alive
at this point there's literally no escape
you two are pathetic you're sub
oh god oh good lord what's this what the fuck
so
it's a road
turn
I kind of forgot about it.
Fuck no, bitch.
I could- okay.
This recontextualization has made me-
I like how the cutouts just always stare at you.
They fixed season 8 with this.
Fortune's just-
It's going to just stare at you.
This couldn't be any more poetically fucking retarded.
I love it. Okay, season 8.
My mouth hurts.
Is there a cover from this?
Gerogol.
Gerogol.
Oh my god.
I love that even though we've lost Jared, we have Tonal that he's honestly kind of better.
It's your dad-o.
I love it.
So, interesting with this one-
What I only liked about your Hobbit videos is because you were doing what essentially me and Mauler do all the time.
So this is Maul Combat Dead Deception.
This is the opening cinematic.
I guess the less you guys know about it, the more fun you can have with me.
But I was so surprised to see this because this is a game I used to play all the time when I was younger.
I was just like, oh wow, it was an action.
The movies are the robot essentially and we pick apart what is wrong with them.
I feel like the kind of movie, like the kind of perspective you're advocating for would just make for really boring art.
We had to talk about something called Eater Response Theory.
Why?
What the fuck is that?
That's Eater Response Theory.
Why?
Oh, dude.
What we're doing is objective.
Come on.
I had something really insightful to say here.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
What the fuck is going on?
Oh, God.
Like how any cinematic that has a revealing person coming out is basically perfect for an eFap meme.
Bitch chat.
Oh, God.
It's going to be him.
No.
No, never mind.
What the fuck have you guys done?
Where the fuck are you coming from in this shot?
How the fuck is this even possible?
Where the fuck?
What is this?
What are you?
What the fuck?
Subjectivity, yeah.
I'm objective.
Inspiring common sense.
Fuck game strategy.
Change.org.
Change.
Not over.
God damn it.
God fucking do it.
Fuck that episode.
No.
Spin off.
Yes.
He's fit.
I was the fool who brought him.
Can destroy this threat.
Born of deception.
The repository.
It's really good.
Loads of really good quotes in there that match.
I approve 100%.
I like that the dentists managed to make it into a meme.
Okay.
This is from, um, isn't it no consistency?
He should.
He, Loki knew he was in Germany.
He should have spoke German to them.
He should have.
Imagine he did speak German.
This is like, we never got to see really German.
Why does he know how to speak German?
He's from Asgard.
We have Germany and Asgard.
He could have jumped from a plane, I guess.
He could have parachuted down and then, you know,
disengage the parachute and, you know, jump down.
But then I guess the parachutes landed on all those people.
The wind took it.
The wind took it.
I want to see the parachute just land on all those people now.
I think that'll be better.
I just see like some people awkwardly pull the parachute off them.
It's like screaming at a guy just pulling straggles.
He's like, Oh, my God.
Welcome to the post-apocalypse.
We're fucked.
Always a fan of those.
I really like that.
Right.
So this is the Batman animated series turned into a meme.
All right.
Happy Dragon Pictures dot com, I guess.
So I imagine we have to do a lot of pausing on this one.
This is old.
Should be all right.
You never know, especially with the music.
Objectives.
Do you guys watch the show?
I'm sure I've seen several episodes.
I can't remember.
I think I've seen some of them.
Yeah, I haven't.
I guess I'm expecting that dance.
That was good.
Yeah, the other thing is really good.
He's even got the silhouette in my mask thing.
Wow.
This is Batman.
That was the meme report.
That's good.
I like that.
I like that a lot.
That's great.
That was me.
Super creative.
As you can tell, all the bees we looked at so far are very different.
It's like they all come from sources and creativity is great.
Made in an afternoon.
An evening without sleep.
We very much appreciate it.
The masses that come to run our favorite.
Ruined.
The masses that come to run our favorite franchise.
Ruined our favorite franchise.
The masses.
Based on characters in the film.
Say a total.
Say a total.
Luke the third.
If you haven't seen Batman, the animated series.
We're officially the largest masses.
I guess that's me.
Brought to you by the meme.
All right.
That was good.
That was that was really good.
That's Goliath saga.
That is in the the docket.
Don't worry.
We're getting there.
This is.
I believe the history of EFAT part six.
Oh my God.
Goliath.
Go fucking to your ex.
What fresh hell is this?
Eyes on Goliath.
Goliath.
Goliath.
Goliath.
And I'm right.
Goliath.
Wow.
Frog will play in the black man.
What's that about?
Huh?
You should play the green man.
That's true.
Hello.
Hello.
Philmo.
Kyle open.
Kyle open.
He's destroying the Philippines.
He's destroying the Philippines.
Yeah.
This shit's brutal.
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Who will be Thor?
Oh, I know who's going to be Thor.
We'll see back.
It's got to be.
Total.
You know.
It's either, it's either total to the dog.
You never know.
It's gotta be total.
Oh yeah.
I was about to say I don't think the dog existed yet actually.
See now we got the funny thing.
Imagine fucking Toad Lokes seeing this shit.
This guy's being around.
He's like, why?
Now he's tattled.
When he's angry, he's, you know.
What can developers learn from that?
Infinite wisdom.
Don't make me learn a lot.
The only way games get better in this.
One of the rings is the big game.
Not Regga's.
I love it.
What the hell is that?
Why are we looking at Gandalf?
I'm assuming that's all.
I'm only nearly halfway through our meme videos.
Oh my God.
We're not even halfway through.
Oh my.
I'm definitely going to have to pause a lot with this one.
Oh God, just looking at the title.
I know what this is going to be deleted.
We're all just waiting to get there now.
People call me.
Don saved many orphans, men and women that day.
Sadly, he died after using the video.
He could have survived if he still had his motorcycle, but it was stolen.
I'm behind.
I didn't see that part.
Beautiful.
It's on, but not forgotten.
This is from Siri animations.
This is pretty awesome.
The fab horror movie trailer.
The last Jedi is a masterpiece.
The last Jedi is a masterpiece.
The last Jedi is a masterpiece.
That's great.
I want to go back to the.
Yeah, sorry.
I'll try and pause it.
It's my icon just hanging.
You will see it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I could see it.
At least three times the beer.
That's great.
That's great.
I guess they're showing the new Halo game now.
Can't wait to be disappointed.
Halo Infinite, right?
Yeah.
If you just say so in no module.
I had moderator.
Oh, yes.
Right.
Oh, God.
This is the moment the weird wolf was typed out by rags for 300 seconds.
Why?
Listen.
We're going to talk about power.
And how I've just made him a moderator.
How all of me in despair.
King of the moderators.
Wags.
King of the moderators.
Visual representation.
I'm not putting my name on the scarf.
Oh, my God.
This one's dumb as fuck as well, but they're all wonderful.
That wasn't dumb.
That was a masterpiece thing about.
I think eating going on a diet.
It's not a bad idea.
So hold on.
Wait till he lands.
Wait till he lands.
He makes us all look like backwards idiots.
And frankly, the.
Oh, up in smoke.
You see that?
Look at these POG champs.
I don't know what to say, but I love it.
I'd say I'm in the band.
It has left me horribly.
This one's really quick, but wonderful.
Oh, this is like a really awesome edit.
And I just never got to play it on the show.
So it was for what E.R. came on.
Oh, I don't know this one.
Oh, my God.
What is that the theme for again?
Wow.
That's the that's a theme from Inception.
The laugh is from Death Note.
Yeah, they threw it up on Twitter and it was like, oh, it's really good.
This is the history of Efap 7.
There's a lot of histories of Efap 7.
This will be relevant.
We watched this recently.
I'm glad that I'm a hell dear.
Yes.
People aren't going to get it, but total.
Do not let him speak, he will put a spell on us.
That is very true, to Tonald himself.
Mhm.
You must be quick.
Must pause.
The music is probably going to get me struck as well.
Oh, you know what?
Let's just hope we get paused.
Hey, you went to the effort of making the black of my black.
The black of my black mask black.
Black of your black.
Artificial various law.
Rags is the giant midget.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Words, what they like and what they do not like.
Who are you?
Show yourself.
Oh, that's great.
My expectations have been subverted.
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
Tonald.
Tonald.
Tonald.
Jonathan the white.
Fire and water.
For every like every like a dollar will be donated.
Don's Children Hospital.
What not forgotten.
That is how you submit.
I don't.
Don's expectations with severe.
Lord the rings ones actually.
It's not a bad thing.
No.
Well season eight.
Fuck Dan and Dan and Chuck Wendy.
Come to save me.
I'm JX and today I'm going to watch mojo of all things.
I don't.
You can't fix this.
You can't.
It's a major plot point.
I am so done with this subjectivity shit.
To reach any kind of objective conclusion about the quality of a movie in terms of like a rating out of 10 or whatever you would have to apply subjective criteria, even if the measurements you made are still objective.
And then that's really saying that the people who like it have confused it.
I should pause.
Listen to it.
So you can do that, but other people come.
There's not a previous version of the timeline where you don't have it.
And then because you have it, you stuff changes.
I want to kill myself.
Any other resource that if you have it, you will use it.
The timeline is the version you have it.
And if you have that ability, you can still use that to make things better for you.
It sucks to say it, but be having people call you names because you say bad about a thing.
They like is part of the job.
I love the echo.
If it goes wrong, then we can't.
I genuinely do not think your opinion on anything matters.
You can think that was bad.
Critique.
It's bad.
You know, when you see like a train crashing, it's hard to look away.
Literally get off the internet.
I guess we've, I guess is the conclusion that it works as it is, but it's consistent, but it's consistent in something that's not good.
I'm just going to deny that you've made any arguments at the end of it and then claim I'm right.
And that will be how the debate will go.
And I will based on my superior logic.
You are worthless to me.
You got a wolf soundboard with this shit.
It's insulting this to meagles meagles representable than Eric.
Would you prefer it if I were to give you five dollars or stab you in the face and if whatever you say, I will just be clear on all of this unless it goes badly.
No.
We're not doing that.
Stand by me.
Are you shitting me?
No.
Requiem for a dream.
No.
Stage.
No.
21.
Jump Street.
Hidalgo.
I don't know what that is.
Peter Jackson's King Kong.
Percy Jackson.
No.
Ex Machina.
Yes.
Planes, trains and automobiles.
No.
Get higher in me.
Um, do I have to?
That was really good.
I really like that one.
That was one of my favorites, I think.
It's funny how I like.
That's a really, really good one.
It ends up almost being an actual like comedy skit at the end, like as if we wrote it that way.
Excellent editing.
Very good.
Very good.
These people have too much time on their hands.
Be repository.
Be repository.
If ever you encounter Goliath, you must sacrifice something to him.
In prehistoric times, we referred to him as the.
If you got a slingshot and a pebble, that'll do all the work for you.
Offer like love to it instead of a sacrifice.
And that's the trick.
Because no one's tried that.
Yeah.
Right.
No.
Yeah.
Right.
No milk.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've only seen a black screen and already this is becoming my favorite.
So far.
The effort.
Can't believe this became a beam.
It's a different stream.
I still remember cynics, his little, whatever, whatever, and he got afraid.
You still gotta clip that up and post that while people who don't know.
I gotta pause for that music.
Yeah.
Whoa.
I think that's, uh, Pacific Rim.
This is Pacific Rim, yeah.
How are we going to ex- Oh god, they're gonna go through all that lore for that episode.
Yeah, I'm already, I can mist, like I could watch this movie.
We know not why he came, only that he did.
After countless eons of conflict, we warded him off with the novel combination of rock
and stream.
And he finally fled.
He fled to the ocean, seeking the one nation to never sully themselves.

Look at this Super Channel.
Look at this Super Channel.
The Doesn't matter what it is it
oh god who's gonna be the kaiju guess it would be Goliath oh right
i forgot what we were watching for a second
what would the soundtrack even be for this potential universe considered it
has the avengers theme load the rings music and inception music
this is like a big mess it would probably just be like a
agglomeration of all three soundtracks with no original music whatsoever
Goliath has chosen six
i'm gonna be totally perfectly honest with you i kind of want to write a book of this just because
i can you should do it the problem is you'd have to go back and find all the lore pieces and put
them all together i mean yeah you could just look at the meme page on the efap website before we
give you enough the idea that this is what this is what he was doing when we were on the call with
it i'm hiding behind oh my god do you just see like do you just see like a black oh not efap yeah
silhouette of a dog just standing there staring at you and then every time you go around the
corner he's just a little bit closer it's like one of those videos i'm gonna be total i'm actually
really tempted to make a book and i'll just it'll be short and everything honestly not even really
i would prefer i'm peeking now he's not bad thanks everybody
is that wait that's like that's a goliath drone
oh
did the last effort left for goliath is goliath's heart
he pet him and told him he was a good boy and this finally called the beast's eternal rage
that's the trick goliath only wanted love
cancer was cured
oh was good was good
except what it was based on the truth it really is though you could actually make that argument
and yeah that's actually it that's my entire of of all right well let's let's watch the thing here
this is i don't even have to pause this is one i know
oh god that or if they i can't wait to buy the soundtrack
oh this is like that or a game
indeed oh really or a lay hmm he's a spoon oh oh god it's howlier what why
it's like a lot of boss fights zombie owl
we like this game
oh shit
oh sweet it rolly brightens back again
oh
or in the death forest no the will of the wisps
is shame no one buys single player games anymore yeah no no one does
i love it i love it i love it like genuinely that looks awesome it's like the coolest thing
we'll get it on xbox then dude come on no i'm getting enough steam come on come on sell my
over time why do i need my xbox anymore halo's not on it anymore uh hello but it's on pc so it's
like why would i bother uh hello yeah that actually means i can now at four hours and
28 minutes begin reading two streams of stupid chats this is gonna be really quick
um but yeah uh i mean just just for those efap memes though holy shit we're um so wonderful
and all in a row and for anybody who's confused about the goliath meme you can find it on
jay's second channel i think but i am making a super cut to specifically release on its own
so that everyone can discover the goliath lore but i think it'll be cool to keep it as a very
is it going to be a sacred lore for a little while you know if you're not in on the loops
then you know you just have to deal with that for a while it's a special kind of law
why is a lot of yeah it's a pretty uh deep lore um god
scrolling give me a sec
scrolling scrolling scrolling
we'll see a lot of people saying county reasons in cyberpunk 27 so
i looked at that i just skimmed through the halo infinite trailer it's just like a cgi trailer
or something not gameplay no so nothing of waste my fucking time i'm irritated because it looks
like they're making retarded what cut up i think it looks like master chief is a robot which looks
retarded it doesn't make any sense is your opinion i mean maybe i'm missing some
something here but a dude plugs according to a thing and then it turns g fon which why
it looks like it's just a reboot of the entire series at this point because 343
which great at least they're fucking admitting to it which will be an xbox scarlet launch title
cyberpunk 2077 e3 2019 oh yeah the first up is
so anyway you can buy a halo deluxe arcade machine it's uh sixteen thousand dollars
it weighs 1500 pounds to be fair seems with it
hmm i'm actually kind of interested in seeing kiana every single thumbnail just
yeah i'm more interested in orie honestly i know but you have to weigh in whole uh like a half
year plus i know i gotta wait another eight months to play game i just play the old one wolf jeez
i can but i want to play the new one it looks really good
um so yeah i'm gonna start all the way back at your your your boy arthur um i'm gonna start
watch through on game of thrones to see how the show looks early on to someone who knows what
happens later wish me luck you'll have to let us know how that went yeah tell smiler i love him
i shall the one dollar donation from a profile says i'm not giving my name to a machine
that's a reference to future armor i like it molar i freaking love you dog that's racist
but uh yeah i think thanks i got an edit for the dominator check out oh i think we actually put
that on the memes so nailed it uh captain marvel and last jedi which is worse
captain marvel i would say captain marks has got nothing going for it while the last
jedi has like one or two things maybe even three oh are you talking about orie when spider-man is
almost out when is spider-man coming out actually that's soon right i don't know i have no idea i've
that meme so often i don't know this is like perpetually coming out
why all the cutting out um i i don't think meal rag's been cutting out it's mainly just wolf
because he's a massive yeah i think i saw all hail the dawn all hail the toxic brood all hail
the cosmic chicken very very true message they established that batwoman is bruce wayne's cousin
doesn't that mess up bruce's character as the point of him was that he was an orphan with no
other kin and only alfred to help him through life he made his own cousin if she was younger
than him oh because i guess i don't know maybe i mean that trailer opens with saying like bat
bat has left us like um what do you why are you gonna explain that people aren't gonna like that
um so happy to see my second favorite youtuber pms itch on one of my favorite shows too bad my
favorite uncle creepy isn't here but his sidekick will do yeah anything directed at psa stitch is
gonna be totally i'm gonna have to remember the context i have to remember like what videos we
were covering at the tiger as well have you watched netflix's daredevil i have i wasn't a
huge fan i thought it was okay um fringy loves it though so and i know it's very popular but i also
know that basically all the other netflix shows suck or uh but the ratings are really high oh
the view ratings you say oh the ratings um yay first live efap
efap gaming cry of fear when we need to do another efap gaming at some point we got to
get that going go and get that going the matter of figuring out the right game in the right time
with the right people you know did you see the tweet i tagged you in person saying i'm a sexism
and you're saying captain marvel is a villain but you wouldn't say that the terminator was a villain
oh yeah i probably did i was in a couple conversations with that i gave up on after
a while because as you saw today she's a robot for some reason you have to explain this to people
when i talked about the don accost i didn't think it would become real
well when you get enough dons cloned and killed could give it such a name
don can't be killed you're gonna be hurt brutally they should have made gedora orange gave his
heads blonde hair and replaced his rules with make america great again there's your commentary
oh that would have gone a little bit too far for people because the whole uh protect the earth
and be kind to it sort of thing was pissing off a lot of people anyway i didn't even really care
about that message because i thought it was so tismy altogether like the idea that we'll save
the planet by allowing millions of these enormous monsters clamor all over it i was like um okay
okay maybe it's because i'm one of those people it's like i don't really mind what the damage is
done to earth it means we can survive obviously the irony of being like if you cause a mass
extinction for the human race by damaging the earth and though yeah conversations to be had
but yeah the main character just sort of was like oh did you have everyone dies whatever it's fine
um godzilla movies always look like crap to me i've never seen any of them because of that
wow chip chip lee gonna gonna piss some people off so i think a good route for a godzilla film
they should do gendy tatukovsky's style no dialogue story told with visuals and audio
with just kaiju i mean i i check it out give it a shot you know you should watch godzilla final
wars i have no idea what that is but i think i've seen that recommended previously as well
hey mauler and rag my girlfriend and i keep fighting over ray and plank because she thinks
they're actually good characters how do i convince her there's really strong female characters out
there how do you convince her that there is show her i assume you mean like real like real
strong female characters well i would start her off with aliens yes alien and aliens and walker
through there and explain notice that this is our protagonist and we don't make a big deal about the
fact being a woman isn't her entire character she has actual things and traits going on with her
and then just ask her questions say could you identify why ray and plank are good characters
can you can you tell me about them and after you tell me about them can you actually tell me the
scenes that you learn any of this stuff or is this just is this are these just things you're
putting together in your head like i actually think about the scenes that we see don't fill in
the blanks good chat divorce here dub her bro dub the geodel as well as break up find a new girl
hi uh would godzilla have been a better movie if it had a big monster sex orgy i mean either way
it would have been a huge spectacle right i can't say that i would have made it worse
i would have been down for that yeah yeah the writing was bad especially the humans killing
the planet and shit also science lady she wanted to save the world by destroying it more
it makes complete sense i just like that she falls back on her plan like the moment she starts
seeing the results of her plan and people are like ah but king gedora made them all evil it
was like uh in the literal previous movie king gedora wasn't even around and the monsters were
destroying shit i just like that's such a bullshit argument that the film invented
does rhino milker count as a real job i don't see how anything is more real than rhino milker
yeah that's the most down-to-earth job you could possibly have you're gonna watch the
new godzilla today and don't want spoilers so i won't be able to watch the stream until later
say hi to future me hopefully the movie isn't really bad may the dawn bless you for spreading
his good name i hope you loved it the kh avenger i hope you loved it i don't like juice too sugary
also the whole nation-wracking thing gets on my nose too i get it very clever if commissions
aren't jobs neither is piecework piecework what's piecework oh you know just like work that you do
when there's peace like it's not spelled as in like war piece it's spelled as in like a piece
of something piecework oh oh that's just a part-time job you're full-time job you do whole work
yeah the point with the whole real job thing we were discussing that whenever someone makes
some kind of weird gatekeep argument for what a real job is you'll find that they don't even
agree with it once you explore enough jobs what are you gonna say well i guess if you're
a author you're not a you're not a real worker if you're a artist you're not a real worker if
you're like actor you're not a the argument i was seeing from people on twitter was like uh
yeah you know youtuber is not a real job it is real work but it's not a real job it's like
um okay
like you don't have a boss i think was one of the requirements it was dumb uh finally caught my
favorite podcast live yay love the lengthy streams and thanks for uploading them after too
enjoy how y'all get me thinking more about writing as well as the enormous amounts of
tears brought forth from laughter hashtag i stand with the dawn i mean the last three streams have
been very dawn focused he's just keeps he keeps coming up we have to keep defending our guy because
i mean fuck lawyers are coming after him now literal lawyers it's kind of oh
what can you say youtube's youtube's fallen down it's fallen a long way you think they'll reboot
game of thrones after george is done with the books i'd like to see the old cast make cameos
kit harrington as benjen for example game of thrones should have an ending like rome or
sopranos um i don't know what they're gonna do i think it would be a long time before we could
get another attempt at game of thrones if if we get another attempt i would what can harry
has uh um that's dark yeah yeah yeah that would be a good way to put him in
oh hey it's psa sitch hey that was from unknown otaku i believe i'm not sure if they know each
other i can't remember um just seen just writes vid complaining about game of thrones i've not
seen that yet but all i've heard from people i saw like the first two minutes i think and i
know that people would just say it's just like one of those hypocritical videos ever because
he's just complaining about all the things that he was like like that's the thing it was a good video
but you know his standard is completely contradictory so yeah you just counter every
single pointy mace by i didn't notice that in my shooting 20 years of youtube completed why is
susan still so damn damn bad at a job you think she were filthy goyim or something um
has she even commented all the stuff that's happened recently i don't even know if she's
still in charge i have no idea how old it works not looking good lately i don't know i bet that
ad guy likes the alien channel i bet that ad guy likes the alien squid in the watchman comic
well he read that recently is there an alien squid in the watchman comic
yeah it's a giant alien squid that destroys new york
hey spectre is the last jedi of bond films also high rag
hi hello i didn't see spectre was it that bad
neither have you guys seen it i've never even heard of it it's the james bomb movie i don't
well wait is that the um i think i no i haven't well we've we've got no thoughts on such things
sitch on efap too bad adam doesn't know jack about such things and these dark times too bad
adam doesn't know jack about game of thrones always the sidekick now get louis on and complete
my youtube avengers assemble moment yes um li yates miens hua peepi
i don't i don't know if that's like a spell or
different topic but i gotta say i love death stranding's latest trailer
homoza demons women named mama good guys protect a white baby based kajimbo
um if the dawn and tonal teamed up could they defeat godzilla king of the monsters
i guess we'd have to ask someone like rags what'd you reckon
i'm sorry say that one more time i was thinking so dawn and tonal
teaming up could they defeat godzilla king of the monsters
hmm
that's a tough one i'm gonna have to i might have to reduce some research on that and then get back
to you because i don't think i'm i don't think i'm confident right now in making a decision
would you rather get a tattoo maybe category would you rather get a tattoo of pro jared on
your junk or be spanked by a spiked baseball bat for 10 seconds sincerely mr massive spanked by a
spiked baseball bat uh for 10 seconds oh wow um i'd probably get the tattoo yeah because you can
get the tattoo removed i guess yeah you can get your tattoo removed or or alternatively you can
just go over the tattoo like i could just say ink the whole fucking thing give me a big black dick
and boom there you go you got one not to mention a spiked baseball bat could actually do some
permanent damage yeah i mean unless yeah like i you know i gotta keep the back looking you know
right proper nice you know like i can't have holes getting punctured into my
backside all that like that's way worse that's way worse don't want to ruin the back door let's just
say that yeah man i mean if it was a if it was a single spike and it was not particularly big and
they kept hitting me in the same spot and it just went in my butthole and didn't actually puncture
anything that would be one thing but that's probably not gonna happen it probably doesn't
fit the spirit of this question so i would actually get um pro jared um his face tattooed
on my penis um but i guess the real question is listen that makes sense but would you have
have you made uh the decision between would he face you or would he face outwards
outwards yeah i wouldn't want him looking at me yeah but i don't think we can choose it's gonna
be the guy who makes the thing you know well i would want him facing outwards and the reason for
that is very is actually very very simple first off it will be oh boy well what what's gonna mean
is that the people like some is someone sucking your dick right they're gonna get the worst of
it because yeah obviously great fucking dick rags this is excellent we should do this more often but
small complaint small complaint minor aesthetic complaint um i got pro jared staring at me every
time i pull back my lips and you would say close your eyes that might yeah i did close your eyes
don't worry about it daddy's got you but if you had pro jared facing you then people would assume
that that tattoo is for you to look down at pro jared and see him staring at you on your dick
while you stroke your dick so people would think you're really weird i mean they'd think you're
really weird either way but they're that you're doubly weird if he's facing you because they're
like oh is that that too that tattoo's for you to look at oh that's fucked up that is disturbing
but also true yeah so that's um yeah that's my uh those are my immediate thoughts if i give it
some more time to simmer i could probably think of some more but i think that'll do for now um
i've got your money's worth yes is your sister also a skull on wheels mr mauler uh the whole
family's like assorted parts of a skeleton so like can't really specify them because they would
essentially be darkside you'll see it during 69 that is a good point um the see here here's
the here's the trade all right let's say you get jared on the underside so positive and negative
right the positive is that part doesn't get seen nearly as much might be able to get away with it
without people noticing um for the most part only the camera guy's gonna see it but man getting
that on there the underside of your penis getting a tattoo there oh man that's gonna be rough all
right so we're getting a tattoo anywhere there going to be yeah yeah but but especially on the
underside okay wolf are you circumcised yes yeah well there you go
uh by the silence i'm guessing wolf has just conceded all right yeah let me go to my board
uh and put another tick mark here on how many how many ticks are on wolf's board
oh wolf doesn't have a board yet when i need you see i get them on a i buy them when i need them
so wolf wins i'll go out and i'll buy a board but that makes a lot of sense i was saving a bit
of money here stitch and efap together it must be my birthday instead of a warning beforehand
damn it that is a good question jay let's discuss that would you rather get out of the tipper stack
that is oh boy what a choice ah that would be right i don't want to choose either of them
we go the part in between both of them oh what if oh what if like would you have to choose your
left or your right or would it have to be like a smaller one on both i don't know we need rules
we need we need we need some rules here but you just uploaded a video wolf
i i just recorded the orre reaction we upload oh stealth video oh well i knew people were gonna
ask me about it because it's my favorite games all right snip out the reaction i'm gonna i'm gonna
read out the title of a video and i wanted to guess who uploaded it why this fallout youtuber
couldn't avoid drama the truth about oxhorn i can't imagine who it would be so anyway
sit should efap oh wait i read that one set set up a warning beforehand damn it can't
catch these lives without prepping my milk and have no spiders you guys should get alt shift x
on as well keep up the great work i would love to have him on but i seriously doubt
that he would but i you know i i always say that about people i should always just try
i'll send him a message at some point and be like hey go about game of thrones
nothing kills a hangover like an episode of efap love listening to you guys keep the great work
why thank you lucas finally saw it live here's some money from mother russia by the way my
girlfriend thought the all-female shot in infinity war was embarrassing you mean end game because the
infinity war woman was fine as far as i was terrible as awful it's an sjw it was nowhere near
as bad as the huge midgets dude the large that was pretty large tools yeah that was um godzilla
is a better hero than captain marvel i agree with that um your pal rags of house efap first of her
the undressed queen of video essays the colo colonial marines and the first queen of our
police of the great youtube sea protector of the realm lady region of the seven kingdoms breaker
of beds and mother of wolf well breaker of beds that's uh that's all right i'm so glad i did that
i'm so glad i can fucking check that off my list it's still broken too that's the one we
did with jeremy and uh jeff that episode where you explained to wolf that uh you broke it was it
was the homonym thing it involved breaking beds i can't remember it's there's a lot of efap lore
to keep track no i don't i don't think so was i don't was that was that a live stream i talked
about that you said i try not to get on the bed on that spot that's something like if you were
dueling with dual home homophones and then you said homophones if you're dealing with
homos yeah and you break the bed and you said it's always in the center i think i can't remember
efap scholars will definitely study that all right generally the center of things is where
they break because it bends the most there that's where mine broke i agree kind of i tried watching
the mist on netflix and got about 10 minutes in before some emo kids started talking about
patriarchy and white privilege uh this kid's chin and forehead collectively make up less than a
third of his face he is ugly and should feel sad his opinion is also mongoloid in nature that is
that is mean that i'm not even sure who he's referring to it's probably the first dude we
covered by the way rags uni pop 2 review when belch what now uni pop 2 you're gonna review it
i think you love the game what okay no i what review for what what to uni pop have you not
heard of it oh um yeah i played the first one it was i mean i mean look the payoff for the work
that you put in not really all that great the thing is i have an internet connection so my
access to unrestricted free porn of basically any kind is limitless so if you're gonna make
me do some work for it there'd better be a pretty good payoff right it's a it's okay it's fine an
indian chick is nasty but i just feel like uh feel like it's not quite worth the effort
game's a little cheap i'd rather run dress gals in real life i know that's assault but
yeah i was gonna say dude do you want to go to jail like what the fuck uh the girls there
don't don't hold the male men don't give them the male gaze that's all i ask
i want to get fucked by a rapist all right misogynists tell him i do want it
types the left wing vision of the jewish conspiracy oh i could see how you could you
could pass them back i guess but there are misogynists everywhere look at this rags creature
look at him staring staring at the chat at all the lambans i'm staring at the chat i'm looking at
the fuck you guys are doing over there i see through your lies i know you whispered dissent
among the ranks uh shit like this made me into a single issue voter i now vote for whatever makes
makes hoes mad oh i get it oh i guess i have to answer i have no plans to
you honey pop to the sequel to honey pop one i don't actually uh no i don't actually uh
how dare he criticize our don hang him i mean we can't don wouldn't want that
wouldn't want that he's okay with being criticized he gets it a lot from people who just don't
understand the don the don ask someone to smile that's sexual harassment that's from wolf by the
way king guy donating like some kind of disgusting creature gets told to smile equals sexual assault
dismembers own baby in the womb wamans health care hong hong hey molar and co i'm curious
considering what's going on with captain marvel being a hero but acting like a villain if you
heard about upcoming amazon series called the boys i have not the boys i haven't heard of that no
it's an upcoming comic book series where a justice league style group of heroes are in reality
complete villainous jerks that need to be brought to justice in by regular people all right it could
be cool hopefully it's done well yeah don doesn't deserve this shit fuck this pro probably never
experience parental love or something it's it's quite possible i bet carol doesn't even drink
rhino milk i think it's safe to assume that uh the don is kind enough to offer a stranger a ride
somewhere and this idiot acts like it's a bad thing it was sexual harassment unless you know
as long as we agree and it's punishable by law we've literally got two very authoritative sources
confirming this guy's wonder how many cases that guy's won like as a lawyer i wonder if he's like
shit it's public record and stuff interesting to see i wonder if he edits the videos or if he's
got someone to do it i don't know just wanted to show a little support for you guys i've been
binging all the efaps for the past couple months since i stumbled across molar thanks for introducing
me to rags and wolf work too no problem tony i'm glad you're enjoying them it warms the the the
cockles of one's heart to know people would actually watch all the efaps apparently it takes
eight days right now who knows really once it'll all be done that's almost as long as one lord of
rings movie what's your guys opinion of the star wars land that opened in disneyland two days ago
which is heavily based on the sequel trilogy i watched doomcock's video on it i would i hear
that i hear that they banned people from wearing star wars costumes into it oh let me let me double
check that but that's what i heard what's it called start with galaxy's edge oh is that what
that's what galaxy's edge is i didn't even know that i don't know is it um star wars gal yeah
it's a theme park area uh let's see star wars galaxy's edge costume
so it looks like
uh
i'm trying to let let me see
yeah galaxy's edge is the thing that uh the collider people wanted to invite you i guess
okay you can't wear star wars costumes and galaxy's edge not even the ones on sale
disneyland's new star wars land is enforcing the themes park theme park's official costume policy
why though so dangerous or something yeah the parker quest that guests age 14
and up not wear costumes particularly those that look too similar to star wars characters
um the unspoken rule behind the rule the unspoken reason behind the rule is to keep parkoers safe
and not allow bad intentions guests to misrepresent disney and its characters
huh
uh if a costume guest wanted to cause trouble they could trick other guests into believing
their official members of the cast given the other other guests bad guidance being a general nuisance
yeah it's so guests confused with the staff all right that's
you'd think they would have had that problem a long time ago
all right that's kind of lame yeah yeah that's kind of lame all right all right yeah we wouldn't we
wouldn't want anyone to ruin the star wars brand would no that would be that would be terrible if
that ever happened oh oh don look how they massacred my boy i know well it was rewatching
your ds2 vids and found that ds2 and skull the first sin visions are in the vision i have i
have old year as a boss but the hide knights are still scattered throughout the game wonder if
mine's bugged or if updated i would not know that's interesting um at this point my ds2
knowledge has been sapped because it's been so long since i've even thought too much about that
game but um this possibly it might be an update it might be that there was a way to make it happen
i'm not sure but uh imagine being such an ugly forget that you push to degenerate society into
sodom and gomorrah in the hopes that if standards get lowered enough you'll finally catch some busted
used up oh my goodness rah rah has a lot of takes they're very interesting uh moviebob was debating
there's some things that it is like yeah r-a i guess he does a lot rah raspy teen rah is a
egyptian god i'll have you know ranks yes moviebob was debating ricky gervais on twitter on why it's
okay to throw milkshakes at people i think he wants an excuse not to drink all the milkshakes
um i'd be interested in seeing that oh man here it looks general it's like here's a good idea to live
by don't throw shit at people just don't do it no they don't throw shit at people you disagree with
end it like don't don't be a four-year-old not even nazis really stuff not even nazis not even
not even nazis if you're not doing anything illegal you just can't you can't even mass
murdering nazis mass murdering nazis yeah yeah can i'ma throw a milkshake at them please
yeah you're gonna have to point one out to me
i'm only 29 almost done catching up love you i wonder if he's made it you're on 29 oh
still got away ago imagine any of this captain marvel stuff happened 10 years ago what happened
between then and now that so many people find her behavior appropriate thanks for all what you
guys do uh love stitch i i don't have any clue what the hell happened and i feel like you know
they accuse us of being like wow if she was a guy you'd be okay with it and i'm i would accuse them
and be like if she was a guy you wouldn't be okay with it it's like this weird perspective people
have i guess um how would they feel if the don's husband came around the corner and saw that
woof that would definitely uh oh would change it up quite a bit that would be really interesting
actually it's okay rags people who listen to any asarkeesian tend to be women they're
retarded and uh it's why denarius burning king's landing is logical and in character
wolf is back did you uh well what toppings did you get uh it was a halo infinite trailer with a
side of volume this time yeah yeah so i so i was wrong in crust or thick crust i i guess i
shouldn't have let the conclusions given that i skimmed through the video muted first time but uh
no he's he's still human but now it makes even less sense than that i guess i don't know if
it's a reboot if it's a sequel if they're ignoring halo fi i don't know what's going on
i don't know why people are excited for a trailer that literally shows nothing but graphics but
you know because graphics are the most important aspect of any video game
yeah i just said it before i'll say it again three four three is really great at advertising
things and they're really good at making games look pretty but that doesn't mean anything
great people i do um i can't stay for long i'm at wick but i wanted to ask you guys
what if the coming star wars trilogy is written by dnd and directed by ryan johnson
i mean i'm pretty sure they'll be writing and directing because they like to do that
but if your scenario is running through it would just be a matter of like well
and they can they play video games yeah it would be sad all right that george r martin games
gonna cash this on mula later take my money and say hi to that massive wolf for me when he gets
back oh wait this that's sexual harassment yeah i won't do that i don't want to upset wolf hey this
guy in super chats wanted me to tell uh you hi wolf he said you were massive oh you just harassed
him oh are we are we really like almost done then what do you mean are we almost done no it never
ends we never ends uh we are less than a sixth of the way less than a fucking hell dude oh
i'm actually i gotta go there like 30 minutes that's it's the super chance from i was gonna say
yeah i i will i'll go through them all until i'm done you guys don't have to stay i'll make sure
they get their answers yeah i'm not i'm sorry i'm i'm not staying i i will this is honestly gonna
take me a long time i might i'll hopefully they don't ask any questions that we have to discuss
fucking hell well this is the thing i don't know how else to do it right send me like whatever
questions people ask me specifically and i'm streaming about the e3 games sometime this week
not today some other time like maybe in a few days or whatever i mean join do the same uh rags i can
like put up two notepads and just pop any questions for either of you and then send them both and you
can both do streams i don't know yeah then i can just like just read them off at the beginning of
that stream and here let's do this how about right how about um wolf and i we can go and we can do
a stream with our reactions to mauler reading out all of his super chats you fucking pause comment
on every one of them start it's because i can't i can't stay to do this live stream so you start a
live stream and i'll join live and as he live streams the efap chat super chats then we can
we can respond to it
are you like serious no no no mauler it's a stupid idea i agree with you it is a stupid
the people in chat saying you should do it
um so anyway rags 1911 versus nine millimeter which would you rather have
um that's an odd thing because 1911 is a gun in nine millimeters a cartridge so you're saying
difference between a gun and a cartridge is i'm assuming what they mean is 45 acp versus nine
millimeter i mean i prefer nine millimeter weapons i have many myself i mean the gun that
i keep by my side's a nine millimeter i've got one that i carry i have a 1911 and it's lovely
but i i just have a i have a preference for nine millimeter i just i prefer the capacity
and a lower recoil and it's just it's just taste i mean there's no real winner there's no perfect
there's no perfect bullet and there's no perfect gun except the aka 47
no it's all about what's built for what purpose
superman didn't break the neck he just cracked it oh that's a reference to man i won't be able
to contribute much to these super chats because that wasn't part of the stream so i gotta jump
all right sir um all right yeah fine good good just leave good everything well enjoy dark phoenix
and message me what you think give me yeah this thing i wanted to do send me a number out of ten
you don't even have to put out of ten just send me the you know between zero and ten just just
the number itself and i'll know that's all i need listen um i hope you enjoy your thing i will not
be watching the phoenix i only watch white phoenixes frankly yeah light phoenix fair enough
why don't you clip that and fucking put it in an article maybe they will yeah yeah yeah yeah
i'll uh see you guys later good bye hey guys this will hopefully be the first
stream i can stick around all the way to the end also loved your recent game of thrones content rags
oh yeah man i've i've always been a big game of thrones fan for nine years blood sweat and tears
i haven't really gone into it at all the rags dragged me into watching episode three of season
whatever yeah man like it was bad episode three i needed mauler to just i needed to just bend his
ear i needed to vent to mauler about how shitty the show would become uh rags find a way to conceal
and no no no no this is this important distinction i didn't say there's no superior firearm i said
there's no perfect i if i did say superior i misspoke there's no perfect firearm much like
everything else it's a tool that's built for purpose yeah like a sniper could be the best
for a sniping but a pistol yes if you want to kill someone far away you want to use you know
a marksman rifle if you want to kill someone if you have to carry something concealed then
obviously that won't do the trick so it's purpose everything's a trade-off that's the nature of it
yeah like long range sniper short range nuke mid-range grenade like that's kind of how you
this is a typical wingman yeah uh rags find a way to conceal carry a smith and wesson 500 surprise
50 cal um i think i know that i think that's the big ass revolver well there you go yeah that's
that big ass revolver jesus that looks so uncomfortable to shoot i would never buy one
of those fucking hell man that man didn't get his head sliced off he just had a blade held up to his
throat threatening his life wait uh what's that referencing the meme which one the one with um er
wait what was the super chat that man didn't get his head sliced off he just had a blade held up
to his throat threatening his life wait yeah why am i blanking on that what does that mean
oh i'm just um nodding my head and saying yeah oh and everyone will think i know what i'm sorry
respected sam and you've been disrespected because i'd have to be completely maybe chat knows i'm
completely bewildered on on what that is i'm afraid um ffs this this happy cricket eater his
women hate him i don't remember which oh two minute two okay uh hey maul i love tfa part four
part five could use a redraft oh and then they put a spider with with the crystal ball apparently
people are gonna love part four but part five is gonna be something that people feel is a little
bit rushed uh that's a prediction from the spider so i will now take extra time on part five just
because movie bob's halo reach review it's insane um that would be something for wolf to
check out because i have movie bob halo reach is it insane because he hates it or loves it i i mean
i guess we could do that i don't remember a lot about halo reach though yeah now this was um this
was a while ago but the ratio was pretty bad at 7 21 up to 1.2000 oh i wonder what he says
what are the comments it's a five minute review top comment um you basically admitted at three
minutes that facts hurt my argument so let's ignore i know this video is an attempt to seem deep
or maybe a self patronizing hehe i over analyze everything but it's pretty pathetic how you're
pulling one view out of it and ignoring everything else for the sake of appealing to one demographic
you can just as easily say halo is in fact sexist against men because it says men are one-dimensional
characters only capable of being energy rifle fodder unless they are sensitive and care about
their cgi girlfriends more than the fate of organic life i pulled that theory out of my ass
much like you did with yours in reality the context makes or breaks the hidden theories
the overarching theme of halo is contradicted by both of these theories the theme is setting the
characters everything makes the context and by ignoring it you end up making a shitty video with
too many le funny may may instead of entertaining well that sounds like something we should cover
i will put it in my notes because uh this is a short one that i really like the islamic state
is comprised of people of all ethnicities fighting for what they believe is a facelift trying to
conquer them and denounce their ancient culture as barbaric and evil glorious caliphate confirmed
for good guys what could i do with this video i want to watch this video i kind of do want to
watch it we can't we won't be able to finish it i've probably got to leave 10 minutes to get ready
to go we'll we'll just save it i actually can't show up without so i i do need to do want to we'll
save it for next efap if you want yeah yeah let's actually do that let's get wolf in here and
very well another star wars or not star wars sorry uh another halo you know nerd type
that'd be really cool because i really like to reach i like to well like i wolf anti-reach i
really i think he's anti-reach now in bed i'm anti-reach but for the halo games i'm definitely pro
reach i enjoyed it but i'd not uh that was fucking when i first when it came out so
i really wouldn't have much to say on it was substantive um anyway thor tries genocide is
exiled and stripped of powers bad captain marvel threatens the dawn steals dead wife's motorcycle
hero i know right dr strange refused a nearly impossible patient which came back to bite him
when every doctor refused to take on fixing his hands oh yeah oh my god dude this i i just skim
through the timeline of this um is this video i'm an escapist haven't even started it it's the same
editing style that he's done and this was this was like eight years ago yeah he hasn't changed
like at all it's the exact same fucking thing every once in a while there's a meme face or a
meme picture and i'm like man wow it's like like if it is broke don't fix it that's his thing
if it it's the exact same thing he's got the little meme faces hello fortia same one
some of them are the same pictures that he's been using for eight goddamn years look in
fairness uh yms does the same thing
eight
yeah i mean yms uses the um the uh one of the rage comic faces he uses the face of himself
looking really like sad and you know i haven't gotten tired of those faces i find it funny
but i mean if you're trying to point out that movabob hasn't evolved or anything then absolutely
but it's all the same exact same it would be one thing it's like yeah it's like it's the same thing
but i've refined everything about it and it's so much clearer and crisper now and it's all
great but no it's not it's it's the old crap is just kept the same
well then yeah um i actually like that extra bit about doctor strange it makes that a lot more
interesting the um his refusing patience ends up hurting him big time later because he gets to feel
well he gets to be on the other end of it what if don is an old jew who aged well and captain marl
just assaulted a holocaust survivor hello racist and nazi pill department oh my gosh you're right
uh i mean it could be lots of law to don hello to my favorite toxic brood mauler i saw your series
on amnesia versus soman i loved it keep up the good work also host the dawn on efe we would totally
do that i would pay that guy to come on in in character just talk to us as the don it would be
the best thing uh look up involve as long as he does well clearly he hasn't but the edit it was
involved as long as he does well clearly he hasn't but the edit it was bad to begin with
so like eight years goes by and you're doing the same thing and it's always been bad i'm like man
all right i don't know if i could do something the same for eight years look at your stuff mauler
your stuff's changed my stuff changes like every video because i get new ideas that i want to do
do well how how about you find something that's awful and just stick with it forever
why are we listing the superchats when spider bat is coming
look up one minute 40s vid wonder woman is a whore ignore title but a clip from
justice league war how a real female hero deals with people wonder woman is much better than
captain marl i agree with the wonder woman is much better for sure i just i didn't think
the movie was that great myself ryzefap nice nice bag of rice nice nice bag of rice slash and dash
scorch and torch oh we finally made it to a fifth don's fault was being nice had he bent her over
and reamed her while telling her that her father was right about her the worst she would have done
would have been to write a blog post about don while cheating on her beta spouse
all right what's that i started game review channel called mark the cyborg and could use
some feedback the vids are similar in format to rags weekly reviews on eg so the efap audience
might enjoy them it's mark with a c check him out if you'd like to guys apparently they're similar
to rags format good luck sir rip boogie 2988 that meme will trick me forever until the day
he actually like dies that i'll be like you guys cried wolf too many times then it'll be really
wolf cried he did when he lost his pizza press s in chat to salute boogie
if we give him a dare all the infinity stones she will have the power to avenge don
i mean i'd watch that movie again these these are very good ideas for movies i'd say
um
godzilla big dick energy yep to be fair i did love it when dr strange as an ass
the other thing is the film was saying he was an ass godzilla was a girl in the 98 in the matthew
project one is godzilla a girl in this one i thought there was two godzillas in that movie
remember they killed one and it's like i don't remember i don't remember either i'm probably
um i know i don't want to i don't want to stereotype with
i wouldn't want to misrepresent godzilla 98 that that film is it it did lay eggs she laid eggs so
i'm gonna go out on a limb here roll the dice probably gal god bless chris hamsworth for knowing
thor is objectively stronger than captain marvel even the comics say so well she disagreed thank
you very much regarding captain marvel's likability she's the worst heck dear devil
enjoyed hurting people but he's more likable because it's an acknowledged character flaw
while still having heroic traits agreed the meme repository brings you an offering check your twitter
hopefully i we watched it today um people die for siding with captain marvel in civil war two
she leads several to their deaths including her lover war machine even magneto disagrees with her
and she dismisses him as guy who compares every thing to hitler wow i wonder if they'll go in that
direction i somehow think they won't oh my women are f-king retarded and shouldn't be allowed in
kitchens because they burn the house down there i said it okay jail me i mean that lawyer would
make a case for it so the don offering carol aride and asking for a smile is sexual harassment but
rose forcing a kiss on finn in tlj isn't yeah but gotta understand power dynamics yeah well
it's different because rose was really attractive so it makes total sense that he'd be down with that
how dare you getting some of that getting some of that sweet sweet rose t co booty no
oh wow that was hard to force out of my group i i could feel your pain that was tough that was
a tough one i don't know don't make you do it again that's what about his um i mean that would
be a request uh just just a request for an answer about the contradiction for that person if they
were making those separate claims i guess assuming the conversation wasn't about a specific thing in
a different movie but fair point uh this stream is sponsored by julie sweet god no well how do you do
it am i swollen omg guys for the last time you can clearly see that wolverine skin is not black he
is clearly a villain i i don't i don't think that's the the argument anyone would make but
rags can you link to your book yes i can um i'm putting the finishing touches on it right now
so um i'll get with there was already on amazon it's called iridescent not checking iridescent oh
yeah because of the uh i had a radiation experience yes so now i'm iridescent and i glow in the dark
specifically only certain parts of me yeah uh insert if your dick could glow in the dark
would you have your dick glow in the dark if you could have that if it was a choice i think i go
with yes why not i don't think so maybe continue off non or is it a permanent thing
uh i think it's a permanent thing so like it just in the dark it just glows it's like rudolph's nose
oh no well yeah i gotta say no if i if i had a preference i'd say no yeah all right all right
yeah it's going to insert hokai sarcastically applauding the futurist gentleman the futurist
is here she sees all she knows what's best for you whether you like it or not better watch your
hands with this chick yep that's all in civil war i remember that bit it's very much more applicable
to captain mola can you do an unbridled rage of civil war why would i do that why would i lie
about the movie and claim it's bad i would be awful at least zod asked people to kneel i stand
with the dawn um yeah yeah he he doesn't force people to kneel he asked them to that's much
ask wolf to release a kindle vision of his book
downs
i think he's um i think wolf said he was inspired to write a book about the rise and fall of the
rome fire yeah based around that it's based around the emperor who actually is midget i
think he wanted to do one for the efap empire as well no he said he was going to call it little
caesar that's racist being so i worked really hard on that so i'll take a few ha ha's in the
chat for that we'll we'll we'll see if they say it here we go let's see yeah we got some about
the dawn and mothra
oh you got a lull uh-huh ayo hey a taxi fap uh and see i think i got a boo yeah well you go
fuck yourself you gotta get a heckler once in a while yeah yeah yeah yeah that's harassment
yeah that was demonetized your channel because i'm an lgq person
and that's harassment being immortal doesn't mean he's exempted from laws what the fuck he
still feels pain included when he extends or attracts the claws about i'm really not sure
what video that's about at all ground table i've waited a long time for this moment my toxic
friends also known as ever really dawn true they wanted the dawn to slap his butt but a butt double
would not do it yeah see rose is a woman so you might think fin ray paid her but fin is black so
he didn't also she's asian so she oppressed him however rose is ugly as balls tranay duke oh
that's these racematisms so the real oppressor is luke the white man uh you should get brad brad
on that boy is a legend brad brad that sounds like a familiar name not sure brad's
catching an efab live at a reasonable hour it can happen
sexual harassment is not a justification for assault with a deadly weapon
because lest we forget her powers are nuclear arsenal level or worse that's true she could
probably obliterate earth if she wanted to yeah that makes sense i mean i don't see why not she
could literally just fucking slice through the center of it and then we just be fucked
a girl in my college steals the core of the earth and just eats it
fills it sells it on the black market i've um i've actually got to head out i gotta get ready
for the shindig i hope this shindig is a good hoot nanny oh it will be quite the schmigagle
so with that i'll uh i'll watch the rest of the stream later when it goes live on
mooler and i suppose what i'll do is i will catch you later i will be back later tonight
we'll keep a track or maybe maybe of questions that are specific for either of you guys
yeah you bet done and i will um yeah um bye-bye gonna go off breaks bets see you later
have a good one yay what a massive first time i've ever soloed on efap i remember
that if i've ever done this before it feels terrifying i've got such stage fright how will
i ever read such super shots um poor lone mauler this is weird solo efap um a girl in my college
told me oh wait it's gonna force me out of the call in um in discord because when you're on your
own it doesn't let you stay in um um wait footy is in chat can i just ask him to join and not say
anything otherwise i just go to in discord off okay i'll throw footy in
nerd wow dude come back hurry up and put my socks on what chat said rex quick come back
oh well it's basically i realized that if i'm alone in the thing that'll eventually boot me out
and i was like oh i'll just have to roast oh no okay so that i can keep the thing on the screen
but you know footy is just a year old right well um i'm gonna go now have fun ma'am i will
hey it's ma'am i said that ma'am nope wow he said no and then he left so i couldn't even reply
isn't that fucked up yep um a girl in my college told me she liked my sweater and started stroking
my arm i dumped a milkshake on myself threw up my arms and started yelling hands up don't shoot
this is what feminism has done all right the femoid cries out in pain as it strikes you these
are very strange super chats roundtable is a homosexual version of upper band oh i remember
us reading that out actually which means we're finally up to possibly a third of the way through
the previous efap we're really making progress guys that muslim in radis from the previous efap
yeah like youtube fucked up and so i couldn't read them out and so i said i'd read them out
next time and now we're at this point where i'm still reading them out um and it looks like i'm
about just over a quarter of the way through all of the super chats and i started reading them like
an hour ago that muslim guys stop donating oh god yeah they're still coming in fuck that muslim
raiders had the right review on women fact okay i can't the woman the muslim in raiders oh i haven't
seen raiders in ages so there's probably some kind of comment that guy makes um this guy is a massive
that's fair i think rags implied he's a concealed carry holder he is absolutely took his test
relatively recently to get it renewed i believe why he's talking about the laws today um literally
saying it's not the scene they chose is a better defense than what these people come up with but
no even what they didn't go with was also right somehow yeah if the defense of the captain marvel
scene was that they didn't actually do it you'd be like oh well you know what yeah and there's
like why are you talking about it so much when it wasn't even in a bla bla bla and just like yeah i
can see that as an argument but no they um they're just going ahead and just defending the whole
thing they were like nah this is all good it's all good um there is no women on the online only lizard
people what is what is what is your opinion uh well aren't lizards uh known to very commonly be
hermaphrodites yes but technically there are a little bit of men as well pmo fried dates yes
yeah yeah yes why do you criticize videos they aren't even real um there's some that are real
most of them aren't really right but some are and you have to treat it as though all the marks you
can't tell which ones are real which ones aren't do you know the ufo videos are real yes did you
guys know spider-man's coming out i did and i believe fortilla's probably looking forward
to that right yeah that's pretty soon right isn't it like can you check that early years
all day and i just decided not to google it let's see spider-man far from home
damn it i clicked the wrong thing next nominee for sad feminist handy this bozo
sad feminist handy i assume this is still about the guy who's defending her i'm assuming third
of july third of uli oh wow mauler how's your tfa part three video coming along um i haven't
started the editing yet the script is done i'm still working on my game of thrones stuff which
is coming along episode five uh video is coming and it's probably gonna be an hour and a half
but um he's gonna be fun a non-white kretin white knighting and virtue signaling there is no more
unsightly and pitiful instance possible how i wish people would listen to bezmonov so that
they understand why these npc's should be stopped criticized and actively resisted well here you go
this cuck will make these videos for two years and not get laid then he'll either
drug a girl or prep uh oh oh my oh crush crush in front of him oh
god did you guys uh only watch ory yeah i don't think we watched anything else yeah but
that was updated i don't really care that much about anything
not even cyber they announced john wick 4 i don't believe you even though those are now stages ago
why are they now wait john wick 4 at e3 why would they do that
well i mean it was a meme in the twitch chat i see but uh yeah he uh keanu reeves was in cyberpunk
in the new trailer i and yeah then he actually came on stage that was that was actually pretty
cool i have to jonathan wick came on stage yeah james wick
jonah wick yeah james gill no jonah hill jonah hill rolled out on oh wait i can't say that's a
fat shaming this is why we need to close the border man got the alert to the stream an hour
and a half late so you only missed the introduction sweet yeah let me give you a donation from paypal
using a system called the super chat on the youtube media platform from the interwebs
yeah stop talking about captain marvel spider-man is coming that's that's a new effab meme it's
fantastic for that i finally caught an effab live thanks for streaming today guys that was
the other one we did but yes i'm glad you enjoyed it i'm working on writing a story for the don
before he meets the dreaded plank because why not maybe some effab adventure titles effab versus
space fish why why would she be space fish unless you're saying that's what the don was up to he was
fighting space fish i could see it stop dazzling me with your ignorance your shiny half-baked head
is burning through my retina like an acid made of stupid i was magnus the red tts um i can't remember
who we covered after thinking that that might be referring to shiny half-baked head who's the
sidekick now sitch they didn't use the name i'm afraid for the person they were but yeah there's
been three references to sitch being a sidekick i think that's to do with this podcast finn was a
first order salvager but yeah i'm possibly uh yes it's actually true all of it if they kill off
phasma it'd be consistent with her character um in the ninth episode i'm assuming you're referencing
and yeah oh my goodness uh have you all seen bright did the phasma die well they could easily
just bring it back if they wanted to right oh it's one of those off-screen deaths it's one of these
have you all seen bright bin and if so what's your opinion i'll see your response on mooler after wick
um i've not seen it but i've heard good things and i am interested by the concept basically like
superman but evil why not yeah have you seen the trailer of it uh yeah i have there's lots of
whistling it's actually like it what lots of whistling oh and the trailer in my mic or something
no the the trailer like i remember when i first saw it i was like oh my god this is like a rip-off
and i was like oh it is actually a rip-off like on purpose yeah i think it was just a sort of like
hey we should just do it new ip whatever yeah pretty fun movie i want captain marvel to sit
on my face that was from veto that is a sexism you can't say that unless you want to say that
that's that's how that works i'm pretty sure uh wait can he say it if she allows him to say it
like what if her boyfriend no unless it's okay
oh like i think that does make sense and if you disagree you probably a racist i haven't
actually checked my race but i'm not disagreeing though i'm writing it down here no unless she
says yes yeah i think that's pretty straightforward like wouldn't you chat you'd agree see look every
single one of them said yes except for the guy who said you well that that guy's that guy's a
wrong maybe that guy spelled out his name with numbers instead of letters took me a second to
figure out what his name was oh i need to like things on twitter as well i just forget to like
things on twitter it's like a rude i'll be doing a rude oh there's another meme i'm gonna have to
save that for the next time no worries and uh uh email making noises i apologize for this
ill professionality it is quite a mile acceptable smile is making noise excuse you
mile dude that's i think you you've probably upset three cultures oh god i'm still sorry
imagine watching this shit and trying to argue if it it isn't sjw propaganda
oh you're talking i'm assuming this super chat is relating to the model why didn't the blacks
use the magic balls on tony um i'm thinking the magic balls couldn't save tony from his his his
wounds oh rags you beautiful doggo i love you so rags is gonna have an interesting set of
messages slash questions oh rags you beautiful doggo
i think my brain is running out of steam i'm not even spelling very well right now
i love you so there you go my fault well i blame you for most things don't scare me like that
colonizer what are you talking about i'm not arabic i don't i don't remember that happening
in the movie and if it did that would be offensive but um yeah there's a lot of crazy
things to sort of think about with those lines because it's like wakanda wasn't colonized
they they kind of colonized their other tribes yeah i said it wakandan doctor
he built colonizer me you neglected the slave trade wakandan doctor peaceful protest by burning
down my city oh i remember yeah that's another thing they sort of let happen and then blame
everyone else for it happening when they had like the most advanced technology it's interesting
it's interesting time to listen to both efap and tgpp whoo oh i believe that they only managed to
stream for like a half hour or something because they the chat wasn't working so they're just
like we're like oh it's fucked we stuck through for like an hour of no chat working it was terrifying
despite being 13 of the global population wakandans produce 50 of all scientific breakthroughs
i know that mean molar a four-legged stool is mathematically more unstable in more positions
than a three-legged stool get debunked you massive yeah but i was thinking more you take
a four-legged one and you remove a leg as opposed to placing the three legs in a you know statistically
better environment because the triangle is one of the like strongest shapes or whatever right
isn't it one of the strongest objects or whatever the the way it comes together i i i used to know
this yeah i think so because uh if you break like if you make it not a triangle then the whole
structure just breaks right like a square you can reshape and it will still have four corners but
if it's not a triangle then it'd break either way triangles are cool squares are not cool
it is it is a square square see jay lynda in fifth grade which means it has to be true
oh you guys just don't get it black panther is correct about everything because black people
were enslaved by jews oops i mean white people he he you controversial super chatter smartest
took a car made by toyota and gave it armor and remote control tony stock built an ai capable of
autonomous flight and super heroics yeah but sure he did more than just the car thing did a lot of
things message to my fellow blacks we've wasted far too many years on these broken white boys
time for us to return to africa to wakanda let us go i mean you'd be a pretty cool place to go like
for a holiday if it actually existed i want to ride on all of i want to hang out in all the cool
high tech shit that's that's what i want to ride a rhino dude that's another thing with armor
this survey is literal cancer oh we're finally to monday matt survey there we go we're almost
past this stream maybe the the previous one this only goes to show how supremely inept monday matt
is i was only going to do a small super chat but this massiveness is awful i know hey guys sorry
i missed the last stream my father was waiting for an organ donation but the doctor had his
hand broken and motorcycle stolen oh i remember reading that out the doctor's name was acton no
jesus fucking christ it took half a fucking hour for that to work did all of you at least clap
uh yes youtube get your shit together yeah oh yeah this is probably when the chat dies
things got exponentially excluded exponentially bad after sn1 fuck dnd oh yeah everything slowly
got worse in game of thrones pretty much season six was much better than season five though
using money is the only measurement is pathetic con artists make money that doesn't make them good
agreed voter lives matter i haven't seen a single episode even i know it's
shit oh there you go i pulled over the side of the road to vote oh so we did a vote on a
straw poll we were like everybody's devoted because the idea was the monday bat had a survey
to prove that people actually liked the last season of game of thrones
and uh the survey was a grand total of 2000 people were involved in the survey and on the question
of did you like enjoy the show 63 of people said yes i believe yes or yes greatly or something
like that but that particular question was only asked to 300 people out of that 2000
and um a large amount of them were also asked are you a fan of the show and they said no
so it's the most useless survey ever and we decided to do a straw poll and just get the
number two above the amount of people that were asked in his survey and then be like see more proof
apparently this guy pulled over just to vote that's um that's some commitment right there
dimitri thank you don't worry about me not knowing a single thing about the issues at hand
for the vote it didn't stop me in 2016 elections it's not going to start me now all right then
i guess since the transformers movie made money they must be good yes that is how that works
it's over matt i have the middle ground man man bad did you watch the cornetto trilogy your thoughts
i adore the cornetto trilogy it's amazing i actually recently watched shawn of the dead again
because uh i think it was like on tv and it was just casually put on the background i ended up
watching a lot of it it's good shit very very good shit uh when dnd further ruined star wars
blame george lucas why would we ever do that the only way to save captain marvel is to make her
the overpowered hero that everyone is afraid of breeds a good actor when a man tells you what to do
oh well wow dude i'm betting captain marvel 2 is going to be amazing and she's going to prove all
of you misogyny's wrong um have they revealed who's gonna direct that oh i imagine i'll try to
keep the same team as the previous one i don't know yeah because that was such a good film also
if dnd ruined star wars surely that'd be disney's fault for hiring them like you know thinking
about it oh and last wait that was probably a reference that was a reference i think can you
ruin something that's already ruined i would say yes because terminator has been ruined like four
times now a Porsche series yeah i was a reference to monday map basically said if you didn't like
game of thrones last season you have to blame george not dnd
he's a very smart man poor george uh girl i know asked me to buy her a bad dragon
very well i doubt brown table's positive cm video got striked
that's an interesting point i wonder if it did because like everybody's coverage of the
deleted scene got hit with a strike and obviously the curious interesting thing is what a video
that's covering it positively get struckened possibly possibly never find out is there a way
to find that out um i guess we just have to check his twitter see if he talked about it ever but i
pretty sure it never went down as far as i am aware of it who knows but doesn't it show up like
yeah the like in the info section of the video like contains blah blah blah from oh well if he
didn't get hit with a strike it wouldn't say anything right but if he did and he appealed it
it wouldn't say anything anyway oh okay um why are we still talking about just in quotations
two things ironically berserk proves what rag said about sex be more entertaining when you
care about the characters yeah i agree with that i've seen the first season and wolf why is your
first book out of print i want to read it um well i'll put that in the questions for wolf
we'll make sure that he leads it not fucking hell this is why is it
okay fine i can't even copy okay this
the other section why is it it highlights the whole thing stop okay fine
that didn't fine i'll just say why is your book out of print i want to read it
so
that might be if that might be happening then because two people have asked about that now
whoa i'd suck a fart out of don's ass that's that's that's on you but fair enough to me it's
uh obvious donnie just needs some good hugs and yeah i think we should be the ones to provide
if if he's you know lawyers trying to put him in prison i think at this point we need to be
the ones that help him out wait wait wait is he requesting a hug do you want to get beat up by
marvel yeah so dodgy actually yeah you can't just go requesting like friendliness i would go as far
as saying that's racist as well would you agree with that i think you'd agree with that i mean
it deserves an ass kicking that's for sure and then someone should probably go steal your stuff
as well just you know to to make the point even more clear i agree like take your jacket
for example for example they could potentially just take your jacket and your bike if you have
one so so i have passed over now to the super chats of the current stream which is a great landmark
um and the first one is i can't believe i used to like you guys oh man there's a mole of fields
right there it's like we've finally got it oh um wolf we love you i'm gonna put that in wolf's
things wolf we love you uh first oh the person followed up with because now i love you so they're
saying i used to like you now i love you great i get it hello all my sith lords super excited to
see this guys yeah a lot of people were really really interested in seeing us cover the legal
legal thing have you have you seen that yeah legal eagle yeah the guy who basically says that um
captain marvel is legally within her rights to do what she did to don in that deleted scene
via self-defense because he technically assaulted her i think i just got cancer from you saying that
yeah that's uh that's how most people felt reasonably but yeah we covered it it was a
disaster um and it was the season for this is a weird season finale for season three of efap
don't even have rags of wolf here at the end of it it's gonna be weird uh ban mauler from england
oh my goodness wow i'm actually on time for an efap that's excellent good job sir so don't
worry because most people kind of miss them regularly because we come up whenever randomly
decided to does is weirds fail me my favorite threesome is on i can recommend a series love
death and robots a 18 parter animated series blur studios who also who also makes halo cinematics
um yeah i heard that a couple of people in my class have seen that and they said that it was
like really like weird but also really cool and like it has a lot of different shit in it
i've definitely heard it before i think someone's recommended this on efap before actually
i will i will pop it in both rags and wolf's selection recommendation
just so that they actually get to see it because again like i take
well i say i take recommendations i i do my best but there's a whole list that i want me to see
i usually go with that one first and i haven't watched anything new in a long time i've been
trying to watch some of the expanse and i'm thinking i think i'm watching chenobyl with
with with wolf soon but i've just been working on the game of thrones stuff
it was efap yeah i've heard a lot of good things about chenobyl as well i've only seen episode one
and it's been pretty good uh i'm very much interested in seeing the rest of it which is
kind of cool because it's already happened and it's still something i'm like oh man i can't wait
to see how the story adds boom it's like well earth's light so is efap season eight going to
be worse than game of thrones well yeah see so we're in the golden age of efap we got one more
season that's apparently going to be good then season five is going to be catastrophic then six
will be like a resurgence we're kind of getting there again then season seven
fan's gonna be like oh guys you're kind of doing the same thing you said you wouldn't do
and the season eight everyone stops watching and then season eight is when i join like on for full
and then we make a prequel series that everyone kind of likes is okay with
it'll make sense trust me i'm definitely memeing the queen now oh yeah you did do that and i put
it on the thingy this is a wonderful relationship the efap has with his nice big circular um
is it symbiotic relationship when yes i believe that's correct
i put pineapple on a blind girl's pizza once it was hilarious oh my god
shit uh shout out to the dawn foundation for curing tism he did do that yeah it was only
it didn't work forever though because in order to maintain it he needed both hands and
marvell stole that from him rags your new intro added several years to my lifespan
here's money for efap um i will get that message to him his new intro is awesome
it was beautiful
take my money daddy take it so hard that's oh no i made sounds like a nice person yes
i make my game reviews my latest was on bloodstain curse of the moon and rags is one of my primary
influences i also speak 300 times more like a human than tonal despite being actually part robot
that is uh michael j fox has parkinsons which makes you do the chism he moves
people taking wolf out of context nonsense nobody does that by the way have you checked robot heads
don but not forgotten shirt it's majestic he has one of those god
amazing wolf it's been ages mola take those coins hi rags friendly dude
hook yes imagine watching john wick and when gun fights break out of the camera focuses on the
civilians running away instead of on the action my brother on how they handled the fight scenes in
king of the monsters there's a lot of that in king of the monsters it just randomly cuts to people
running going oh my god there's a godzilla oh i don't care godzilla eat them please whoever said
there isn't a good story in godzilla is stupid both the og and shin godzilla examples of a good
and decent story retrospectively respectively sorry and uh well that's the thing i don't see
why you wouldn't have it good story go for it who is more powerful crapped in marvel or rem lazar
oh it's rem lazar that's not really a competition cabs in marvel wants to be that powerful
objectively jedi fallen is disappointing so far we did talk about at the beginning of the stream
we weren't that impressed hoping it's going to be a bit more interesting as time moves on i suppose
i mean i i only saw i haven't seen the entire like gameplay thingy i saw like the first
five minutes of that video that's released and it's kind of weird because i wish i would have
seen the controller of the person playing because that combat could either be really like just
boring and spammy but it could potentially be kind of sakiro ish because it looked like
he was parrying and stuff and like you have to parry in the counter attack and so so like i i
think that the fighting system has some potential depending on what the controls actually are yeah
but it could also be very very shit we will see i that's pretty much my
fire position on that one hoping it'll be great though um expected captain marvel commentary got
porn discussion oh probably um probably us yeah i'm horribly irresponsible with my money so here
you go have a nice week why thank you clayton godzilla was disappointing me because the monster
battles were really underwhelming to me they kept cutting away to the humans when it was getting
good did i watch a different movie to everyone else i like the monster fights but i still accept
that they cut away from the the fighting a lot as well yeah um yes this is going to be super
chats all about godzilla now monsters are the protagonists humans are the supporting cast like
how thanos was the hero of infinity war take out thanos and only follow avengers and movie sucks
i still like the avengers i like iran bad and capitan american wolf i know you're busy with
efap and all but i really need you to come over here and work these tits you saucy bitch
i'm gonna do that make sure it gets to wolf of course he'll hear that it's important like
i don't see how he could progress in his life without hearing that it's very encouraging
free youtube red bucks wow thank you the environmental part of the movie was the
same as samuel jackson's in kingsman oh yeah i remember that an interesting um idea maula i
don't understand why you think somers a horror game because my cat didn't feel scared once
yes that's a pretty much the single identifier of um whether or not a game is scary
i i can't exactly do that rag is clearly consoles beat pc because i serve my corporate
overlord and wolf hello i guess i'll copy that for rag
what did you say foot here i heard that shit oh i was just saying it depends on if the cat can
spew out tentacles and shit from its mouth oh that makes it a little bit scarier but
i don't know it's objective uh mola what's your favorite game
i usually say metroid prime and then i often said super metroid as well but there's a whole bunch
of ones that explore really high like resneual four is one of my favorites um dark souls
uh stoma and amnesia they're both very much up there there's a lot of games from a lot of genres
a tough question to answer honestly i'm invested in sweet sugary love with aunt jamima all right
but spider-man's coming out and it stars the dawn oh my god i'd love it if dawn was in the new one
i have to disagree mola most godzilla fans go to see these movies because they see it as monster
oh wait i did actually respond uh did you do the last efap super chat somewhere i just did them
hopefully gay gay rick is able to um knows that i i hope so any both i was very sad to hear on
your stream from last wednesday that you'd lost your passion for making videos i just want to
tell you that although efap will never be the same without you i support you 100 if you choose but
he did um sort of get comments like that in the stream so hopefully you would have gotten a sort
of answer from him if you wanted one as opposed to just telling him that but uh i will make sure
that message gets to him mr chip i'm not sure if he actually acknowledged it during this stream i
remember someone mentioning typically think yeah like i said i'll make sure i send it across
or he appreciates it the wolf is very much a wonderful part of efap some say efap would
never be the same without mr because i mean we'll never get like how he bites people's heads off
it's actually quite quite fun you should have seen him and rags were losing their shit with the
legal legal guy fucking counts as assault if you put your hand on somebody's map okay
um final wars is still the best godzilla movie it's tarded but awesomely tarded all right i think
that's fair i have to see since there seems to be a lot of debate on king of the monsters would it
be possible to get dman 1954 or mr h reviews to discuss the movie on a future efap they're big
godzilla movie fans and enjoyed the movie and had some criticisms i mean i don't think me wolf or
rags really care that much about godzilla the only reason it keeps coming up is because people
are very disappointed that we said that it was poorly written and wait you can tell we're a
little bit confused by that but i'd say that i think we're mostly clear on it there's gonna be
a couple comments on this this stream i imagine that are like no you're still not getting the
point and if there's something sort of new that i definitely have missed we'll bring it up in the
next efap but um i wouldn't expect much more godzilla talk other than we're gonna have any
fap movies for the 98 godzilla eventually we've recorded four efap movies by the way i gotta
edit all of them i gotta edit another mini i've gotta edit the the the bonus stream for goliath
memes and i'm still working on the game of throne stuff and then i got tfa um it's a nightmare but
we're getting through all of it eventually it's gonna happen just like getting through these
superchats i am a huge fan of the godzilla movies but i'll at least admit that most of them are
objectively terrible despite my subjective love for them that's kind of how i feel about a lot of
big monster fight movies i'm like yeah godzilla blasted him with his atomic breath and his face
fell off and it's like yeah but what about like plot it's like no kids it's cool godzilla have
that in the older godzillas i believe so i remember people being really disappointed
that he didn't have like atomic breath in the 98 vision in the 98 vision he has straight up fire
breath it's pretty cool in the 2014 one he just did that yeah because i i don't know why but my
memory of godzilla is just you know big monster who just walks on top of things it reminds me
of some reason that hulk when he goes big monster yeah i don't know why but i never remembered him
as shooting stuff so when i saw that and uh not this one that came out now because i haven't seen
that yet but the first new rendition of godzilla and he did like the laser beam i was like wait
what the actual fuck did he just do when his tail like lights up all the way up to his head and
i was like this is so cool i don't know if anyone mentioned this but check out shin godzilla the
human parts in the movie are actually pretty decent it's the american ones that have the
dumb human stuff i didn't like the humus of that much in shin godzilla but i thought it was better
than the american one for sure uh help rags i got caught in my own zipper again oh well
it's addressed to rags so i better make sure i can't i can't be i can't have rags going through
his life without being told that uh someone's trapped in their own zipper you know hello again
just dropping by to say hello there to all glad to see the main crew back in action to tackle
these idiots i stand with dawn absolutely if everyone defending the film because the monster
fights they were better fights than almost every other godzilla film with any other monster in it
i don't understand how these fights are good i liked them a lot i liked everything with king
gedora but maybe a spectacle overthrew my ability to uh rationally pass it out i don't know
on king of the monsters the story was good but the writing such dialogue was hit and miss you'll see
better writing in godzilla when the villain is when godzilla is the villain rather than the
protagonist fair enough what were you going to say there vodia well will chat hate me if i if i ask
what uh what this spiderman meme is so when we covered the the first guy on the previous efap
his video is talking about how he thinks he's dumb that people are arguing about captain marvel
and obviously the reason that's happening is that new deleted scene got released and he sort of
skits around that and tries to make it about the fact that like people just won't leave captain
marvel alone um and like one of his arguments is spider-man is coming out soon
we were all just laughing and now we're using that as a meme forever it's like why are you
talking about this spider-man is coming out and it's gonna get even fuddier once spider-man is
released we'll just keep saying it's coming out soon uh mola please watch the older ones like
biolante and try to explain the human parts of that the scientists take godzilla's dna and put
it into a rose bush rose bush all the movies get kind of nuts that sounds fascinating
as i said though i'm not too interested in godzilla movies in general um but i can
definitely tell there's a lot of fans activation can go f itself a rebooting card activation are
supposed to be activation but yes they are doing that and people are going to buy it let's see how
it goes it's going to be interesting i don't know there is a godzilla movie that is close to nothing
but fights called final wars yeah i've seen a couple of recommendations for that now
perhaps we shall check it out in a few have you seen star wreck in the perkinning it was a budget
15k cgi made with regular pc so most frames in battle took over 10 hours to render
oh i have no idea what that is um but interesting isn't 10 hours pretty fast i don't know for a
single frame multiple computers i don't know oh single frame yeah that's probably pretty much
i thought it was the entire scene the most frames in battle took over 10 hours to render so i'm
assuming he means each frame uh are we going to ignore vera going full thanos most people might
pretty temporarily goes full thanos you're not allowed to criticize godzilla until you've
watched each and every godzilla movie then everything makes sense if story doesn't matter
in a godzilla movie then i guess the first one doesn't matter huh and that's regarded as the
holy grail for the franchise i've not seen it but perhaps that is true a lot was fine just like the
plot of the meg was fine generic stereotypical and genre driven the plot of the meg was dumb as well
oh i see that one it's a sheik movie look at brie larson finally out of pe for a laugh
i don't know when that's referenced
i'm assuming it's a capability video some kind out of pe
uh the godzilla movies in the 80s to 90s had decent stories and something like final wars in
2004 embraces its stupidity from beginning to end do you know what i mean there's a lot of godzilla
fans in this community i think they're probably more fans than haters so godzilla yeah i would
imagine so most things have more fans than haters it's not star wars or game of thrones
there are two easy references i wonder what the trick for that is right now actually
if there were no monsters on screen or nearby the people there was no reason to pay attention to
the screen um pretty much actually yeah i agree with that remove the story we only want monster
fights i'm happy with a story just make it simple and consistent we'll be fine then
well i can understand their point to a certain degree one of my favorite movies is pacific rim
the first one and there are definitely parts of it that require you to turn your logic processor off
again though that's fine because i'm fine with that and like literally everything
if you gotta do that do that but like as long as we don't like as long as everybody's on the same
page like yeah that is dumb but fun speaking of good films by the way i i watched it whiplash
today i've never seen that before damn i should have just one i did watch that was pretty good
it is not i i haven't seen before yeah i liked it a lot it was one thing that didn't make a lot
of sense but oh yeah what was that it's fine uh how it seemed like uh the jazz teacher had
planned out to embarrass him on stage yeah he did when he yeah but he just happened to to see him
play at that thingy they never would have met them what happened to that obviously
was just opportunistic he had that gig anyway and then he was like oh i can fuck him up
yeah i don't know felt weird to me in the scene i don't know um
the very original 1954 film is unironically one of the best films of all time even according to
these nasty critics half the chat says watch the 54 film watch it do i have to watch it guy
what do you think do i have to watch a film from 1954 no film was good in 1954 everyone knows that
the Godzilla one yeah is that the one where they have like a doll as a Godzilla like rar
i mean it's 1954 so yeah it's a black and white one like i said it would be on a list but the
problem is that there's a lot of things on this list and then eventually it would probably fall
through and it's not like i don't want to watch it i'd be interested i just you know i tried to
type Godzilla without looking at the keyboard and it became gizuka gizuka almost 1954 let's have a
look at like a guy in a suit i think well it probably is a doll
he looks so cool look at you little Godzilla oh there's a picture of him eating a train
how cute that's offensive i feel shin Godzilla isn't dull mainly because of how much parody
they do regarding the bureaucracy of the japanese governments and non-action during the 2011 tsunami
near nuclear meltdown that's probably an element i missed when watching it maybe i didn't realize
that was the dillio hopefully no super chat issue this time nope we're making it right the way
through i don't think the last stand is as bad as people say it's not anything amazing but it's not
god-awful either seems history is repeating with dp um maybe i need to re-watch the last stand but
i do maintain that apocalypse and origins are both terrible donzilla real king of the monsters
is greater than god shiller king of the losers i i so thaw is a transgression doctor
how did thaw come into i don't remember now because we've just moved on from
Godzilla talk to the dark phoenix talk efap is to Godzilla's oh yeah we did read that one out
hey boys been looking to catch you live for a bit now thanks for having sitch on i've been
lobbying for that for a while all hail the toxic brood huh yeah yeah we did get him finally out of
p is a song 16 year old brie sang oh i think i've seen that actually i saw it on twitter never
been like what the fuck i read that ahead of time i'm sorry he skipped the queue everyone but it was
it was it was a relevant piece of information i'm sorry how dare you do you think that i'm gonna
write it now it'll be chat riots
there should at least be chat riots chat come on do it i will pull out my gun
do you have the mauler gun i do
i like that pat crane just went three three three i can't pull the gun on you guys don't you do it
i also have the policeman mauler as well
yeah you just you just smack them with your baton stay right
i can just imagine a bunch of mauler feels like guys pretty strong
um but yeah if you want to use those emotes it's actually a pretty decent way to uh
maintain support of channels now as well it's just the join button thing it's essentially
the same thing as twitch but there's no tears i don't think and then you get to have goofier
emotes what more could you want beautiful uh did you guys see care about the new pokemon game
i didn't but for tia might what do you care about pokemon i really wish i did because i was a huge
fan for a lot of years but i really don't anymore and it makes me sad
i wish i was a fan but i'm not sometimes caring isn't sharing you know yeah for sure yeah for sure
oh blue jay oh jay can now shoot people in the chat
what are the remotes do i even have out here i forget so i got mauler feels mauler rage mauler
heart mauler yes mauler stressed mauler stop metal eemie deep b mauler smart mauler gun
metal eemie b is the perfect emote for when anything bad happens
i actually really like that about and happy ghost because happy ghost is horrible
oh wait so is happy ghost the the thingy they get next to their name i thought they were everyone
was typing that emote before everything they said badges um i think the badges i could have
sworn the ghost one was actually pretty high up let me let me remember ships then everyone's got
a ghost one so now i'm like wait oil yeah badges there we go so uh oh when you're a new member you
get the ghost okay when you're a one month you get a butterfly for the butterfly milk two months
you get a rhino rhino milk six months you get a milk great milk one year you get a rhino drinking
the milk and then two years you just get a rhino with milk on his lips as you can see they're very
inventive also look at this dude how weird is this uh 20 people are two months six people are one
months and then 30 people are new members how did that happen i guess you advertised it when
it was brand new and never again until just now wait sense also what did you say who to
i oh yeah isn't this like a like a direct rip off from twitch like with loyalty badges
the joint system like everything is like just taken directly off of it it is a complete rip
off and we should sue oh they should this guy has the rhino four months i don't know how long
we've actually had it going but yeah well i have a red mean you guys oh the mean we're pretty sure
we can probably get a new emote now actually let me check custom perks no custom emoji there we go
i don't have a rhino but i have a wrench get fucked guys oh yeah i can actually add a new emote
okay let's see what the options are quickly let's unlock a new emote for everyone
how quick is that i don't know i guess we're gonna find out
um i kind of want the mauler lull because i can't have lull and i really want lull
oh can we have the varus ech
varus ech is funny i want to try it see if it works mauler varus holy crap there's a lot of
people coming in now oh jeez beewen or beowen oh beowen sorry the dragon beowen night hawk

oh you have to keep reading the super chats just one second i just wanted to see if oh
yes varus ech there we go beautiful
oh my god yeah fucking hell wow you shouldn't write it up a little bit
dude what it's a little bit dark bright i mean it probably looks pretty good on phones a little dark
yeah hard to make out can't really you have loads of them okay
you do like stressed gun varus ech uh anyway yeah i should i'll continue to read
how far into the mario now how far into the this stream uh donation sorry let's look see
jiminy christmas i haven't refreshed this page yet as well so
there's only a guess summation but a quarter of the way through today's ones
the time limit is eight hours and we're at six hours 16 minutes so we should be able to make it i
think i reckon it's not a virus
um okay hey granddaddy mauler daddy rags and wolf onichan do you guys have any favorite
movies where the focus was the visuals or music like space odyssey or fantasia
favorites that are focused on visual
i um well i mean the question was a direct at me but i like the one uh i don't remember the name
not just because of it but uh the the one that where everything is tied to the music
oh baby driver yeah that's one even though the plot is really yeah i trouble enjoying it for
that reason um but everyone's different with that sort of shit because i was going to say 300 is a
film i actually really enjoyed for the style the music and the visuals even though i'm pretty
sure that film's pretty tisme everyone is forever green thanks everybody for becoming members it's
actually very very helpful for the the channel in general you all get to have tisme emotes look
mark just made use of all of them except varus ech why would you why would you do this
someone ban mark please jenna jenna uh what do you think of alex why did you scare me so hard
welcome alex castle uh what do you think of the new godzilla um i guess that's all the beginning
of the stream so if you're hearing this now person uh it'll be on the moolah it'll be right there
uh gonna watch later bless you boys bus thank you very much rakita law is greater than legal
eagle uh a few people mentioned rakita law apparently they're responding to legal eagle
as well so hopefully i can check that out it'll be interesting entertainment writing has gotten
worse since legend of kora and in some cases better gaming is better somewhat but i have
more fun replaying kingdom hearts one and two cheers wolf i don't know which part of that was
directed at wolf i guess that's just sort of here's to wolf in general but sean bush thanks for
becoming a member that's clearly buch what is the difference between b-u-s-c-h and b-u-s-h
uh there's a seaser only oh that makes sense oh yeah oh because when you oh yeah okay i get it
and it's actually shawn bus
that's how you pronounce it thank you shawn bus for the membership you're a nice man should
it's been uh would you guys excite would you guys excited for a new pink fur female wookie she's a
self-independent wookie who don't need no harm yes i would she would be my favorite character
assuming she kills kylo shoot him in the back it'll be great i was gonna watch e3 but you guys are
way more entertaining what hey how about that how about that that's a seal of approval right there
someone needs to make art of the three of them as scarecrow slash tin man slash lion from wizard of
ours with fringy is Dorothy or something i mean one might just from me reading that out
i request sitch be a regular member four is a good number gotta get guests in though gotta rotate
them all if we were to take on someone new we'd we'd probably just prefer to have a you know a
giant you know fight to the death for all these people we just throw them in a big pit i think
sitch would start a good chance though he seems like he has the kind of teeth that could really
just bite someone's head off with that avatar so he'd be fine hello my favorite massives hello
nick is entertaining legal eagle is informative i don't know if we could say he was informative
in the last one lee champion and dong lee thank you for the membership thank you both very much
enjoy shooting people wait i probably shouldn't say that before we get bad spiro thank you oh
not a member's beetle no i feel bad as well because anyone who's watching this on like a
vod will just be like how do i become a member because he'll be on moolah channels he's like
oh yeah you can't have to go to the other one mr man dude man tubes good mr man too
thank you very much as well uh she'd have an issue with excessive force yeah that seems to be a lot of
conclusion nick rikita is best waifu bring nick rikita on you non-law figs
i mean yeah i i i don't know if he wants to come on efap could be cool to have a
a lawyer about it y'all under arrest we got loads of police boolas in the in the chat at this point
how's he holding a baton and a gun in the same he has two hands what his hands is bigger than
the other uh legally called the last femur the dawn is wonderful yeah a lot of people aren't aware
of the the beauty of the dawn so sometimes you have to forgive these uh non-believers i guess
it's okay carlos chicken flipper just told the story he did oh maul stop shot most dressed into
coughing and then crying yep because he gets shot then he lies on the ground he's dead
and then christ and then middle christ christopher grow there greece stuff here
jokey holos is a massive fig is that a reference to the steven crowd of stuff i think it is call
its master isn't it uh nick just doesn't really like legal eagle i mean i could see if he would
have reason if after this one oh asoka tano she's in here dude asoka tano watches efap that's awesome
she's a star wars i can't find the emotes it's been a member for three months why can't i use
them um so in the next the chat box there should be a picture of an emote you hit that and it should
give you the access as well as the normal ones if it's not working i have no idea why not
and i think you uh like when you click that thing the faces are the first emotes to show up but if
you click the thing that is left to the faces and like tabs above the emotes i think it shows
molar's emotes i think that's what you're supposed to do of happy ghosts
can you type it out though like do you have to click the emote or can you type it out
like if you type out molar ghost you can i think you can type them out and then complete them or
auto complete them um yeah i don't think you can do it on mobile all of the ones i've been doing
are on mobile so definitely do it on mobile like god there's a lot of green names in chat
uh any internet lawyer who isn't nick rakita is a massive get him on efap if you cover legal stuff
things i don't know i only have 20 minutes before work make it good i hope it was good
i saw a woman criticize captain marvel and she literally grew a wiener and started balding true
story you become a guy if you criticize captain marvel if you're not already one how about that
that's pretty cool i love being told i didn't like it because i'm a man when i've been unironically
been petitioning for a scarlet witch movie i'd be on board with that too and a black widow one even
though a lot of people are against that obviously if it turns out to be terrible when they make it
i that's not what i wanted i wanted a good one you just hate god i'd rather have a scarlet
or sorry i would rather have a black widow than a scarlet witch
um at this point i'd probably reverse prefer the reverse just because there's more story you can
tell with scarlet witch right now because scholar joe hansen's story is just going to be a prequel
but i want to see both of them yeah but i think i'm more interested in the prequel the the thing
that the russo set up that shit is interesting i'm concerned what the fuck is budapest man
they say budapest i want to know what happened in budapest
i want to see budapest
why would anyone fight you on elizabeth alson is hot why would anyone
you can't make an obvious statement and fight that if anything i'm offended that you want
someone to fight you on that be like hey guys check out some truth and then we go oh cool truth
uh you just hate godzilla because mothra is a woman well i mean wouldn't that mean
that i like the movie then considering what happens to mothra i think that i would
you've only said these things to upset the masses
mac mordian no sorry mac mordain man i'm terrible at names mac mordain i'm sorry
oh kind of you are kind of awful the good thing is you know that so it's all good
good yep nick rakita wants on check your email uh i well i mean if you like i said if you want
some we'll we'll try and sort something out in the future so far every comment you've made are the
same ones that he does right after you pause it and he made it clear that he wasn't following
the situation around captain marvel um i mean not really we disagreed with a lot of the stuff that
uh mr legal eagle said and he didn't even really talk about like if he was being completely honest
he'd be like yeah she's going to jail there's no way it would it would be a good result let's
apart from when she saves the women are taking over the really really are the green men cometh
hey guys just dropping in before work i have to watch the rest when i get home love you all keep
up the awesome work that's i think motorbike milk which i think that makes sense there's a lot of
a lot of animosity people have towards motorbike milk do you think that guy is gonna watch us
say the things we're saying right now and he's gonna hear us talking about him when he's watching
it in the future yes to all of your question bringy would be happy with all these green people that's
true hey guys just dropping away i read that i recently went through hernia surgery and it was
very painful i was depressed and overwhelmed with how long it took to heal this podcast helped me
get through the tisms thanks for cheering me up awesome to hear alec and i hope that uh
that it's all healed up and you're back to full strength hernias are lame remember when i found
out the first thing at the time i found out about hernias was uh simpsons episode with the fighting
hellfish i think it is or that's like a group of people that grandpa simpsons are part of
and they all find this like treasure trove in some german part of a german country i think
uh german town sorry like a mansion and they agree that the last person living gets to have
all of it and mr burns and him are the only ones left because one of their team members died of a
hernia i remember being like what's a hernia and my dad was like it's like a thing he explained it
very well um real lawyer does not equal good lawyer that is true legal eagle she's guilty but
i'm a get her off you'd try i don't think he'd win marooned on a barren island i laid down to die
but a man in a leather jacket descended down and told me everything was going to be okay
i suckled on his nipple and he lifted me in his arms next thing i knew i was waking up in my bed
safe and secure that's the dawn for you man it takes care of people to be fair he is a lawyer
so his moral compass oh yeah i did i did read that out uh thank you so much for covering this
cock who willfully misrepresents the law to protect his client because she's a woman like i said i
feel like from the other stuff i'd seen of him he wouldn't have done that that way if if she was a
guy you'd have been like yep he's going to jail ben shapiro is a better lawyer than keagle eagle
yeah he had a he said the word mansplain at one point in the video
nice it's very um interesting you guys should have rikita law also dick masterson is a fan
of your content molar now i'm a strangle your dang my dad i'd love to see a clip of dick mass
bench thing that he watches by stuff that's uh seems like weird clashing of worlds really cool
what were you going to say mr forte so is when he says mansplaining is that where we go white knight
um yeah i think a lot of people actually have they've been like these this whole video is just
a giant white knight the thing is i don't think he's supposed to get that criticism like i
understood his channel is supposed to be like i don't know really i hate to wait i hate to use
the word objective i'm pretty sure that was the point i guess there's an argument to be made that
he was but well not certainly not the fucking opening commentary all of his random points like
being very like whoa all right oh yeah the um the join thing is $4.99 a month i believe and
as much as they have copied twitch they don't have tears so twitch is the head of the game
of course add nick rikita versus virgin legal eagle legal morality is different to philosophical
morality which gets exposed i think i did ask about that but uh i'd probably google it to try
and get a quick answer i suppose because i oh someone probably did provide a quick answer it's
just hard to focus you know uh people who disagree with me are conservative oh yeah he did say he
specifically mentioned conservatives had a problem with it whatever and i was like how is it that
you need to be a conservative to have a problem with what she did to the dawn i saw dennis miller
live last night this is putting me back into balance rose tigo writhing in ecstasy long man
good oh goodness please no legal eagle is being paid under the table by disney to defend their
client i've heard allegedly uh-huh man desync severity though hope i'll finish my rhino player
by start of next season it'll help you with better pause experience desync severity though all right
rhino player i mean there are a couple of other services compared to watch together but watch
together works well enough that i think that we happy with it sort of thing but um there are a lot
of other ones a lot of people suggest um rabbit but rabbits are different things not quite yeah
it's not the same i don't like rabbit that much i mean after having tried both for this kind of
stuff i way prefer watch together yeah we need nick to defend the dawn against slander i i agree
rags is thirsty as hell that you'd be weird if you was dry you know you know what i mean
rags my man everything right to western progressives is collectively conservative
alt nazi right don't bother looking for present definitions on googs read old books on them very
well i guess i'll i'll copy that for rags i'm not 100 sure of the uh the context arena
but hopefully he may or may not remember a decent chunk of things to send to both of them now
are we dense to defend the dawn the movie i'd watch women compliment my hair all the time you
have no idea how many arms i've had to break and how many cars i've had to steal and i still get
harassed dude i'm sorry you put up with that like that is horrible uh someone else said this in
chat before me but remember lawyers have defended guilty villains so press x to doubt on carol's
innocence it would be funny if he ended his video with that he was like if you were to commit to any
of uh what i've been talking about you would essentially be trying to get a criminal off
he tricked us
godzilla 14 had great writing for the first act you really cared for brian cranson's character
prove you can make it have interesting human characters also have you guys watched rain of
fire yet yes we did i watched it with wolf we liked rain of fire we wish it was better
we're not a huge fan of a lot of the writing in that there's a couple tisms but damn is it a cool
movie and i don't want to see it that would be a good movie to remake i reckon um and godzilla 14
yeah i did like the writing the first act even though you don't get monsters at all for a while
in that movie so there's a couple of tweaks i'd make but yeah i think you can get characters
that you could really care about sort of don loke is my favorite gaming youtuber i think
he's everybody's even if self-defense on the part of captain marvel it has to be a reasonable
and proportional response we were talking about how if it was led into court that she was an
alien god it wouldn't really help her case to say that she was doing it in self-defense it'd be like
this won't hurt you possible like yeah well he looked at me funny even Thanos with infinity god
that can trigger apparently well i've got like an hour left pretty sure i can make for um
what happens in an hour this we get close to the deadline for stream archives it's like they can
only go to eight hours on youtube oh okay damn yeah i don't know why that's the case and i hope
they fix it one day can you like end the stream that started up five minutes later yeah you can
but i'd like it to be one episode instead of one episode in five minutes extra odd episode two
sort of thing you'd be like um he was just trying to help the poor lost special lady in the scuba
suit oh no one is misunderstood by many women apparently except the ones that fall in love with
him sexual harm mapment he actually argues that like if you were to knock a phone out of someone's
hand and it hits their hand they can make like a case that you abuse them sort of thing and then
he's like this applies to anything you're holding and it's like even a map and you're like oh
front of the map i was like hey this is what i mean it's like semantically yes but legally like
in a courtroom it wouldn't fly at all and he knows that like a jury would never take it
seriously this is really annoying to watch it the map was asking for it did you not realize
how far he's having to stretch like it shouldn't be that hard to fucking
defend something oh that's the weird part is he does these weird defenses and then he's like
people just heard it but he says one of the two reasons people hate the movie is because it's a
female protagonist who's like oh female hero and it's like why do they think we hate the wabbons
like we make jokes about it but jesus christ i actually like the female wabbons
you know male wabbons are just a completely different thing
i'm not even i'm not even sure what a male wabbons would be but what about a male
wow men yeah at that point gender sandwich but what what race are females because like
hue man you know hue man man yeah there's not hue women there is that's why that doesn't exist
the court ruled yesterday to have it
oh fuck i miss the meeting yeah everyone everyone misses that meeting on purpose probably annoying
me but you know can it legally be a threat when she's so much more powerful if a young
child says something threatening is it legally a threat like i think even he references how like
it's all very circumstantial you need to know exactly what the circumstances are
oh i think i used circumstantial wrong maybe it's a seven-year-old with a nice saturation
woman that's a clever joke jay but i might go over people's heads if you were to read it out
they'd need time they'd be like hue man but i appreciate and thumb up the joke
i'm going to evilly donate to the children's hospital oh my goodness you villain don's so
humble he didn't say he does tom cruise stunts yeah he didn't even bring up tom cruise he does
though he does even well i think actually chris hamsworth did but she still does if he if she
doesn't get prompted god i i fucking hate that interview you can see how uncomfortable both of
those guys are are you just like uh we don't really want to do this with her kind of weird
and annoying but okay you've invaded captain marvel space okay next time i take the subway
can i use that excuse to beat the fuck out everybody on the subway somehow i doubt it
he touched a map dude he touched a map fucked yeah you don't touch someone's map that's like
touching them on the wing wing i already told wolf this one but what did you call a muslim
mermaid a torpedo i actually saw that part of his stream because i was on my phone partially asleep
i thought it was funny but um youtube have declared war on offensive jokes so thanks for
killing both of my channels with that joke that's what that's gonna do you're gonna come directly
after oh yeah some people were curious i haven't been demonetized yet nice but um it's only a
matter of time for efap certainly because the little compilation they made of steven gratter
i feel like you can do that for efap um as soon as someone does and reports us to youtube we're
done so probably but we had fun while it lasted this guy would probably justify people throwing
milkshakes at political figures yeah he probably would actually probably like it does not count
as salt and battery because they were attempting to feed the person and slipped so it's completely
friendly captain marvel is legally not a villain for your baggage here's some legal ease for you
assault with a deadly weapon because that's what her powers are yeah especially with the threat to
murder him as well and like i said you expand that from taking his hand slash arm off a legal
kegel hasn't actually seen captain marvel because he's a man and this can't stand strong female
i thought it was weird that he said he hadn't seen it you'd think
that he would do that if he's gonna cover it i don't know uh hi what's your thoughts on baby
driver um i appreciate all of the amazing filmmaking elements but i hated the plot and
the characters i thought they were lame as fuck that's funny that someone asked that after we
just talked about it that's true for yeah because this is still when we were talking about the legal
video so we're miles behind the end of the stream still oh jeez how does captain marvel know what a
motorcycle is he downloaded earth stuff okay they do imply in the movie that because she's a really
good pilot that she can just use everything that has controls it's like okay you remember that part
of your life but okay now the law has nothing to do with reason logic morality or consistency
this is why lawyers and judges are desire despised by decent and moral people yeah but he did make he
made the moral argument too in that video he said that not only is she not a bad guy lawfully but
also morally and we were like what wolf and rags are very unhappy about that unlawful is the
modifier here king of the monsters was better than captain marvel kaiju fans don't mind bad
writing if we get good action we prefer good writing but not a deal breaker i mean i actually
think that the writing was stronger in king of monsters than captain marvel but that's only
because captain marvel's like a one out of ten or something ridiculous because there's like nothing
right with that movie john didn't pet ghost for fear of assault and battery yep i mean there's
no points getting around it it's just the truth uh would rags be able to shoot someone beating
him considering he is his own dog ah now that is a question i will put into rags's selection
yeah rags are saying that apparently if someone's beating your dog
even to like the point of death you can't pull a gun on them and shoot them because
like the law in his state where um could be a use of lethal force in defense of property which
is not allowed the legalese for it ish yeah i think i've actually heard that before that that sounds
like a truth um where does this scene take place uh it is a deleted scene assuming we're talking
about the scene that was in the legal legal video and it's in the first third of the movie
right at the end of the first third i guess replace brie with brock lesner and the don with
liana mormon and play the scene exactly the same yeah people wouldn't like it that way i don't think
you might have different takes on it love my state has both stand your ground and castle doctrine
just need constitutional carry to be completed to complete it fair enough uh bethesda's e3
conference tonight my fellow efappers who's ready for more of tod's sweet little lies
i i don't even know did was there anything to do with fallout in today's e3
uh well i shouldn't just say later oh is the Bethesda okay have their thing in one hour
are you staying up for that uh probably not to have some stuff to do tomorrow
yeah that wasn't me implying i'm gonna watch it i'm going to sleep after this but i was just curious
um i meant what state the scene takes place dumby uh i do not know do they mention with
what the state is in captain marvel um i don't know anyone in chat do they i don't remember
the mentioning it ever and that's an interesting point because you'd think you'd be able to tell
at some point with some kind of landmarks yeah no i don't know um i generally like this guy's
videos but this video was awful i agree taylor for an artistic person in avoiding law major and
law major and going for education because of this shat everyone saying i'm stupid because no money
in education read that again for an artistic person in avoiding law law major for an artistic
person in avoiding law major and going for education because of this shat everyone's
saying i'm stupid because no money in education i think i follow i'm just very tired that's all
it is i swear why do you think the same critics who love tlj hate game of thrones season eight
like the rest of us when both were equally bad just as such as just right because they think that
the choices for the characters made sense in tlj and i mean genuinely i think they i need to see
just writes a video from start to finish i need to see if he um he points out things that are
absolutely reflective of tlj or just tangentially related but i'm certain he's a hypocrite because
he describes a quote unquote good story in like the first two minutes of his video and i immediately
was like a good story what does that mean what does it mean mason welcome easy morgan morgan
i already did it before no you neither of us said 69 though so we kind of both fucked it up
fuck dude i'm sorry i'm sorry i apologize mister 69 i'm apparently six away from
75 they said the trade-off starts to get really bad the last emoji was unlocked at
like 50 members i guess and the next one 75 and the one after that's 100 it's like jesus
what's the that's a lot how many emojis does like dans gaming have old lyric or whatever
i think uh all of the bigger streamers have reached the cap they have like
10 000 subs is the max figure say 10 000 emojis like what the fuck no like 10 000 subs unlocks
40 emo slots i think and that's like the max you can have okay no matter how much above that you
go you all always have the 40 clown world honk honk in criminal justice the term force continuum
was used for cops basically if you punch a cop he's allowed to pull out the baton and so on
oh my goodness legal eagle cuck for hire i mean he's probably made some good cases in other videos
i don't know like i said i don't really know the motivation behind this one other than
it seemed kind of political just a little bit
um with great power comes an even greater responsibility someone kill her effing uncle
so she learns that it's pretty harsh but i mean if it's got to be done to learn you know
wolf daddy's finally home from going out to get a pack of cigarettes he would laugh at that
certainly i'm actually going to put it in the selection of messages i'll send it
just to make him giggle
it'll go after wolf we love you uh the dawn has a smile fetish sexual harassment
flicks bug off shoulder is this assault i mean yeah you'd go to jail dude
ryan jay smith thank you congratulations and welcome to the
channel that's racist i'm gonna post um a mauler heart emote to symbolize
my appreciation even though i ate a heart dress
stressed to symbolize that the hard times are not over and we must continue
yes someone's gonna gun out while reading a book what are the implications of that
like am i allowed to kill you by law let's have a look
the dawn slightly folds map attempts to help captain marvel is flirty carol hurts his hand
threatens to further harm steals lawyer she is the victim yeah it seems seems a bit off doesn't it
legal eagle platinum medal in mental gymnastics but we're still on the legal eagle video this is
air is touching you and they touch your ear punch everyone right yeah so if you were to punch the
earful to you and the air is connected to everybody then ultimately you've just punched
everybody have you not i mean haven't everyone no just you so i can sue you not the the females
i believe is pronounced fair male but
are you saying that you're okay with punching the male
yes in a wing wang that is very disappointing tell
do you not know that's your opinion yeah it's a pretty good opinion though you have to agree
yawn yawn yawn thank you just yawned i'm gonna confirm this with my science team
uh superman man of steel legal eagle justifies superman's destruction of
jagov's big rig truck after getting beer poured on his head i have not seen that and i've
completely forgotten what's in man of steel outside of a couple details so but um judging
from that super chat it wasn't this person approved of rakita law said that in civil cases
who takes the initial instigating action is important yeah i'd agree with that but i don't
know what would be counted as an initial action with uh you know that scenario i would imagine
a jury wouldn't see him pulling the map down as a big starter but yeah i've been rang before
he is not a person wolf he is a lawyer oof
don't you think it's unfair that people don't consider lawyers human
um no i think it's fair too yeah here's a dollar for every brain cell in this
person's head plus an extra four dollars oh and he gave me five so he's saying there's one brain
cell that's still kind of you to say that there's one brain cell all right uh not gonna be able to
keep up for a while by the time i'm back it'll have been one year of efap stay awesome you three
love from france um one year vf will be august early august i believe so we're almost there
not quite there but we're almost there he escalated the hell out of this situation
agreed this lawyer looks like a discount jim hulpit i don't know who that is i'm gonna have
a look at jim hulpit oh it's the guy from um the office yeah it's like an older discount
vision i could agree with that moly keep saying no jury would agree with this massive but california
exists i mean i'm being hyperbolic there are people who would agree because he is a person
that apparently agrees with it he could be in the jury at some point but holy shit like
holy shit you know in a marlin brando voice do not disrespect the dawn disrespect the dawn you
disrespect the family moving too long so the impression is going to be terrible but i agree
with the sentiment she literally and obviously needed a ride um i agree and it would have been
cool to see them team up dawn and captain america marvel versus the world but watched it
would have watched it watch the sequels it would have been great the dawn is the
dawn is the main protagonist oh you would have to be how could you not have that
the dawn as a sidekick would be a great movie i i would i would again you'd have to be the protagonist
fuck this piece of shit imagine being the actor who plays the dawn and having gotten so much
attention on the internet for some reason i give him his own movie and he's like why though
oh why i was a fucking stand-in
don came to my birthday party last week when no one else would also what does legal eagle's wife's bf
think of this crap we don't know zach something to discover one day x don give it to you beautiful
dawn of justice the memes are all the best i'm all about that legal life but not like this
yeah that that quote will never age well wow he really said it he did he said several of
the things that i am assuming you're referencing there uh he sounds like a dishonest male feminist
catching catching for virtue points for the girls he wants to bone he does take a lot of
weird positions that could be explained by holding certain politics but i just i'm curious
what his response would be to like a lot of the criticisms he's getting perhaps he'll put
out a follow-up video uh feeling pretty mansplain to quay illegal not gonna lie exactly we have
female people in the audience that he was uh mansplaining to and so he's he's now victimized
people with the same thing that he accused other people of what do you have to say for yourself
uh i did not touch that woman in fact i'll just believe that i mean have i ever told the lie
except for the times that i told the lie no exactly you can trust me man wink wink you
can totally trust me wink wink he's lying the robot you mentioned to just write is evil that
is true as evil as a terminator a terminator is the moral compass the terminator has better morals
than captain marvel we can at least agree on if nothing else this vid has made me want to watch
t2 again been way too long that is a full good choice to do everyone should be watched t2 because
it's it's awesome no denying the dawn is sira connor's cousin that could be possible in timeline
in fact i choose to believe it i feel like the original point of the scene was to imply that
plank was a programmed robot soldier of the kree but they gave up on that idea yeah they
certainly didn't develop that because a lot of people use that excuse like she was the bad guy
guys it's like she never ever thinks about that again or ever develop what oh
just no oh did you see dark phoenix by the way nope you plan to
you uh not in the theaters now
was it horrible it was a lot of people saying it was horrible i thought it was okay
yeah from what i've heard on the intro webs like i would say
a word between bad and okay fine one meh i guess
but not like an unbridled meh just a meh
i see interesting i thought it would be horrible i was willing to chalk this down to him just making
a bad video which everybody makes sometimes and can forgive but him using mansplain unironically
just lost all goodwill from me yeah it's because apparently he's never done that before so it's like
he gets weirdly political at the video i think at least i assume his fans would feel that way
i don't know well what's the context of that anyway um i think it was him saying that a lot
of men have tried to mansplain the scene for the people oh my god dude someone in chat might
remember what the exact quote was but it was a little bit tismy captain marvels a woman so
that means a lawyer can justify her assault it's okay because they felt guilty slash we're abused
and the legal system supports it yeah to be fair comparing captain marvels to a robot seems accurate
yeah i think i think most people feel that way i volunteer for the hate fucking that was i'm going
to put that in in rags's messages he said he was getting that set up and i don't blame
it just you need it done you need it gets rid of the the it gets the juices flowing there you go
what's the problem of comparing this woman to a robot it is brie larson's acting
you this man really makes being a lawyer that much harder really hate this well you only have
a problem because it's a woman bs now i'll have to deal with people lumping all lawyers in with this
douchebag hashtag not all lawyers don't worry i think a lot of lawyers will be making responses
to him because it's we we know it's not all lawyers uh don lives matter agreed angry rags
is almost as great as drunk rags yeah he was he was definitely pissed off by the video today
i don't blame it poor guy has such a great selection of videos to respond to at this point
so i still think he's planning on doing a response to the um the tismy dude who like
we covered on efap uh is it the one it was the previous one i think uh i'm not sure if i meant
to ask if he was doing that still uh the dawn doesn't wheel my handicapped mother to physical
therapy every morning at 5 am to put up with this whole shit i know but a lot of people just
aren't aware of it so no poor guy he's lucky he's got people like us to actually let other people
know just too humble don't go to his channel he wants attention hashtag disbar i mean the video
isn't doing very well compared to his other ones so i'm not sure the attention is going to be that
great for him if your moral argument is external it's objective um yeah like if you're not talking
about how you felt about the particular thing but he did say um it was like a moral argument
at one point he didn't really develop much of it though wait the moral if the moral argument is
external so like the the the other commenter was talking about the um the moral sort of thing in
relation to law i'd have to look into it again because i was confused um about that you'd think
you would have said that specifically though right i thought he was just making a moral judgment like
on a personal level you answered the episode nine question didn't you fortea uh
i don't think so don't you lie to me
what's the question well apparently you didn't and you were a guest so i definitely should
sort that out fine who do you think will be the most inconsistent character of episode nine
most inconsistent hold on let me just think of the characters
yeah and you can't vote for kylo lando or palpatine
uh i guess uh leah since she's just randomly gonna disappear
i mean if you want to go to leah you can uh the most who can i not vote for i'll vote for kylo
because he's nothing consistent about kylo i'll vote for lando because of course they'll ruin
him and then you can't vote for palpatine because fuck we didn't even know that he was going to be
in the movie but apparently he is
i mean i don't i don't know yeah i'll just go with leah that's the easy answer very well
and yeah someone said that you're not an official guest what tier has
guested on an episode before your own episode i want to say two
they just don't know you're on your early memes you are early memes and uh what was your question
sorry uh i don't know oh yeah what's this uh question link for are you making a spreadsheet
or some shit well it's just like sort of i call it a bet but nothing's at stake and everyone's
just voting for who they think will be the number one failed character the most common
votes are gone to fin and luke funnily enough with po being this the next most voted for i
think anyway unless my thing is outdated i know that the subreddit keeps track of it so
we shall see he's not official today that's fine
that's um also mola please write down brown tables not many people came to game night
quote in gedel this fucking gold okay actually not many people about
yeah at the end of it he's a lot of love from chat thanks chat you're being very nice to mr
tia i appreciate that he's a nice man
he at the end of the brown table guy's video he says he's going to run another
game night and that last ones was disappointing because nobody really showed up
but it was very funny
if you ran a game night for tia everyone would show up so what does that say
uh that i i'm a good person and i i do good things for people and uh they i do things that are
good for people not like i tell them what they need to hear not what they want to hear and it
makes people hate me but makes me a good person they hate you because they ain't you yeah i
i disagree with that
ain't is not a word in the englando language it's only in the americano
prove that though let me just hit up bing.com said no one ever
thank you for helping me not waste my time on legal eagle's channel i'm always always great
to see you there i hope you all have a great week justice for dawn um i mean he might have
some good stuff in general it's just that video certainly wasn't if we cover him again
and then again then it'll probably get to the point where like oh oh no are you
massive why are you doing an efap spider-man is about to come out it's not out yet though god
i appreciate that though it's a it's a fair comment it's very accurate
we shouldn't be talking about anything about spider-man
hey 40 you looking forward to spider-man yeah it's funny because spider-man comes out soon
why are you talking about that when spider-man's coming out dude oh god i'm so sorry oh i've got 57
minutes before the time runs out we still have enough time it said unlawful physical contact
brushing up against someone is not illegal um yeah just pull a mini me dude just start
humping their legs didn't it also say if it was considered offensive in there at some point could
you possibly argue that i think that's what his argument was i can't remember popular equals good
obviously hmm yay nerd crew oh my god we're finally on to the stupid chats about that video
from collider i think we're making progress poor crickin he doesn't want to join in with bruce
oh i don't know the names of the guys but yes you can tell it's a white guy wow that's racist
yeah that was i didn't that just backfired completely though i thought that was really funny
but the co-host just sort of made the joke again people are still salty over wilson insults
towards roslaw oh yes yes yes yes that will be a forever thing rich evans's laugh is the reason
of still alive it is a very unique laugh nobody would deny that um seeing as the three of your
pc gamers i assume what games would you recommend for someone who's relatively new to the platform
any must-have exclusives or multi-plats um that's impossible to answer because there's a
shit ton of things that you probably should play if you're brand new like brand new to what now
uh pc gaming oh like this i mean hold there's more pc than there is on console there's decades
to catch up there's no way yeah but um i don't know like just sort of look at like top 100 pc
gaming lists and you'll probably find all the best stuff the orange box is probably one of the best
value things you could get as a brand new pc gaming person um depends how much money you've
got to spend as well i guess there's lots there's lots things uh reformed fairy evergreen guest and
saint longman yes yes please take down legal eagle as a lawyer myself i think he's the absolute
worst his videos are all patronizing lowest common denominator crap hood allow me to explain
dear viewer what the term plaintiff means well i was like you should make a video dude i'd love
to see that lawyer breaking down a lawyer why not a because fortier was gonna do it but fortier's
not a lawyer oh yeah i forgot that part like i i thought i was but i was like oh fuck yeah i'm
not i was like wow idiot well now i can finish the first orie game by the set the time the second
one comes out yes i'm definitely gonna be playing the first one again before the second one comes
out because fuck need a refresh at the very least as the resident efap lawyer let me know if y'all
need anything legal explained yeah we mainly just went in with the layman's perspective on the video
because i'm pretty sure we're gonna get a lot of good videos that are responding to him from like
lawyer people i think someone's already linked me to one from somebody so um he'll be interested
and check out maula has a flupal tingus that is a reference to battle stream
efap crew this sounds odd but i was wondering how y'all divide divvied up the super chats and how
y'all take care of youtube money re taxes mostly just curious uh different for all of us wolf has
ads since i can't remember if he said it has the off or on or what he's actually doing right now
i know that rags uh has things set up tax-wise all sorted i'm um i actually funnily enough got
help from i had everything sort out who i was supposed to contact for that stuff because it
gets very weird and complicated but all separately done um as for divvying up super chats that they
i i basically take all of them unless they specifically uh want to go to rags or wolf
like they said too i'll pass it along sort of thing because like the idea was that i
don't really do streams on my channel anymore um because efap is uh sort of the main content
for streams every once in a while i'll do one and the you know wolf and rags can continue to do
this and i would happily do any guessing for either of them but um i'm not sure what will
happen down the line because again i'm still kind of concerned efap could get knocked off youtube
at any moment um but if we are able to like grow and expand and whatever else we could probably
set something up i'm not sure but uh yeah like i said if anybody was uh wanted money to go to
either one of them specifically just let me know because like i do the all the production
side of things with efap not that it's like incredibly heavily complicated it's just that
uh wolf and rags don't have to worry about any of it um and even the thumbnails uh rags
was actually gonna do them but then uh we had a random person be a hero and make some very snazzy
ones have you seen them for tier i think i sent them to uh uh have you i don't know yeah moolah's
got sexy new thumbnails not moolah now moolah i saw the uh the like caricatures of you like the
i can't think the thumbnails for yeah that's the thumbnails
just go on the moolah channel and have a look at the videos they are beautiful
efap crew this sounds oh wait sorry that's the same uh hey thanks a bundle for all the
entertaining content you create and inspiring me to think more about content i watch slice and dice
why thank you sir for for sharing such things i think if wolf and rags were here they'd be very
happy to know that anybody gets a sort of boost of critical thinking thanks for watching efap
we all very much have fun here so it's um definitely one of those things i just realized
by the way if i get this tired after like a seven hour stream and i'm planning on trying to do a 24
hour one for efap at some point i'm gonna have to be like streaming the second i wake up and force
myself to have like a long sleep and have monster drinks i did do a 24 hour stream on twitch that
one time didn't i i played last of us from start to finish basically uh among other things um
yeah that'll be interesting to set up get like a whole bunch of videos prepared
um rotate guests it'll be great it'd be great well maybe i'll even try and push it past 24
just to be that cool and try and avoid the meme of it being 19 hours that i had on my twitch for
so many years wasn't missing but how do you do a 24 hour stream on youtube oh you do you break it up
into six six six six i imagine no because seven seven seven and a half could do would be
15 22 and a half and then the last one yeah maybe maybe seven and a half i don't know
we shall see uh wasn't mystique the one who came up with the name x-man in this universe anyway
i'd have to check first class but that might be true i can't remember oh crap i got here after
the legal legal video now i'm sad don't worry it shall be available in utra but seriously like
if you have some really good ways to deconstruct him you should uh use it as a you know opportunity
to make your own video in the next april fools video have a dedication to the death of toenails
i definitely could make a comment about how he's looking for work outside of youtube because it
failed to it failed to correctly pay him it shall be considered
uh watch orie be an epic store exclusive where wolf would likely explode oh he did mention that
one uh i figure i've efap more last month than i usually do so here's money this is longer and
better quality than most movies so i'll buy a subscription also chat does anyone know any
professional memers i have an idea but no skill in the field oh yeah jeez thanks for the 50
charles very kind of you and i'm glad that um i'm glad that everyone is healthily efapping that's
um it's very good uh what have you efapped recently have you been able to healthily
get yourself some efapping done i believe i efapped using a controller
don't know is the new shakespeare that you don't understand don't let me look back on years to come
there's something to study it'll be the kind of thing where you pull these videos out of order
and then you attach all the different ways different things and it'll spell out like the
key to the universe that sort of thing um i'll be excited to see that finally get done
i already know this from wolf as he tends to talk about the subject more often but
what would be rag's and mauler's favorite books if any um game of thrones is probably my favorite
from lack of reading enough books i like the lemony snicket books and i really like what i've
read of lovecraft's books um but i will send that over to rags as well i guess all that needs to
happen is that rags and wolf can separately do streams and then they can answer these or
they can answer them beginning the next efaps completely up to that i don't mind i'm technically
part of the jewish one percent so i could afford to donate to annaldo some shekels go for it i
don't know if he streams though or if he has links i guess you could go for the patreon that makes
sense hey rags is it a coincidence that the whitest male of apex legends character uses gas
oh yeah it's gonna have to be here rags is a lot to answer for with that because apex legends is
the game that he created i know this because i read it in a book mauler i legit saw someone
have your old black and white pfp as a bumper sticker yes i've seen it a couple times as well
i guess it's just a cool sort of graphic that a couple people use
the video is the fatality i get it tonald's video tonald himself has been an ongoing discovery
agreed the water is fascinating i need this in my video um you're saying that's what tonald said
when he was setting it up because that's probably very true tonald is like a baby turtle struggling
to reach the sea oh that is him as a youtuber i imagine uh as tonald would say if we look through
the hypothetical spy glass of the passage of time into the future time goes on he's moving on to
better things that's the thing you know you can laugh at his quotes you can do that but if you
think about them for a few years you might discover something just saying uh hurrah you guys covered
the tismy funhouse podcast i clapped also it was james willams who had the c kcd argument also also
alana is galisi um yeah it was it was quite interesting like um just seeing some of them
quotes and they apparently really disappointed their audience with that one so interesting how
that works i watched one rags video and the next day my recommended was filled with every massive
on youtube does that mean youtube is homophobic um i'm gonna say 115 percent yos and i guess i'll
put that in rags's selection of questions as well oh he's got a lot of tisms for both him and wolf
hello there mola tfa part four was great oh wait i did actually read uh can i get some more welsh
representation am i not enough i thought i was long and massive that is that not enough is it not
hello mola love your work it's fantastic you've helped me become a better writer any chance you
could give my perion chronicles books a shout out i mean sure uh perion p-e-r-i-o-n chronicles
any of their books check them out if you're interested um and i appreciate you saying that
i've helped you become a better writer that's uh very kind um yes from malachai dun i'm not sure
if they findable through the old google machine but um don't always give it a shot uh hey mola you
guys are fantastic have you seen just write a video on game of thrones seems to contradict
his everything is good argument or everything is subjective right also i hope you can get critical
drinker on it's potentially in the works and yeah uh all i've heard about just writes videos it seems
extremely hypocritical it's like yeah he kind of lost the credibility on the idea that he has
standards so it's kind of confusing to listen to and be like this bad and you're like but how
wow that's a racialism that's a true so apparently metro exodus is available on the microsoft store
really i thought it was just a timed exclusive with epic anyway but i figure that it's a long
time still to wait on microsoft store too that's interesting e3 reminds me of how much of a blight
on humanity san francisco and the tech industry are i hope the black plague breaks out and infects
the silent supply in that shithole during my lifetime i mean what if soy is immune to black
plague what are you gonna do then um data reminder kids molly equals is real you got the okay sign
that's a racism wake up eldia not know these references i love wolf rodo and jay sam
what i love wolf rodo and jay oh wait that's from the meme video yeah it was quite amusing that
video we had some top tier meme videos today i hope everybody enjoyed the coverage i always
quite feel bad if they're like ones that had extreme amounts of work done on them it's like
should we be cover them is there more things to say it's like obviously i hope you guys just
realize we appreciate them to hell them back they're like so much fun for us to look back on
the tismy things we get up to get in animations and shit applied to them it's wonderful uh jay and
wolf number one on the top 10 anime romances list oh yeah i think it's all but confirmed that
they're actually in a relationship now i think that that's pretty obvious i think that if people
memed about it um wolf and jay would just you know eventually just say yeah it's true so you know
a matter of time i'm sure when stupid internet memes are better than 98 percent of hollywood
movies oh my god that was not that long ago that i read that out from the main chat so
it was when rags are still here so we're getting there praise be to the cosmic chicken
i want to work with a group of people to make an efap movie and ironically i will do whatever it
takes well wait for wolf to write the efap book and then we will um we will get you to adapt it
into a full-fledged movie i'm goliath is insane blood thirsty i couldn't control him not many
people can but if fred the cosmic chicken can't not a good sign let's just say that uh the shadow
of loaf knows 20 pounds to wolf to make an efap book it's roughly the price of a hardback here
in the uk do it i uh can send that along uh the message and i think you can just pay pal in that
but um i hope wolf makes it to be honest will be uh will be fun you can read it on efap then
he's gotta like make it an epic and be very seriously it'll be great uh daily reminder
that guillermo del toro is a fat weeb who tried to grape miras of vino while making mimic um
i don't i i thought it was good i can't remember what people think about guillermo del toro as a
whole but i don't remember being good things hollywood is full of soulless degenerate demons
and should be nuked like the kaijus in that film well if you have that much against everyone in
hollywood uh i didn't think you got enough credit so shout out to rags for that hilarious
burden on jennifer lawrence saying she sounded more like the an ex-wife yeah in reference to
x-men he said she sounds ex-wife very clever actually i shall pass that one along as well
have you heard the observation that just looking at a picture of brie larson makes some men feel
as though they are behind in their alimony payments i hadn't heard that but it's like
you'd say that's believable right for to you yeah yeah yeah the creators of orie clearly
watched efap oh yeah definitely i think it's safe to assume everybody on the planet watches efap at
this point like mainly everybody um mastercheap.exe fully operational uploading npc talking points
yeah uh i don't know what happened with the halo trailer um but i mean wolf watched it so
i probably should have asked more i was busy being confused tired and and and and all distressed
at the idea that i had to make sure i get this done we got 40 minutes left i'm pretty sure i'm
getting close ish i think um if you finish these you you could always watch the trailers
the most interesting trailers anyway oh we did actually watch the the orie one and we watched the
no no we didn't watch the jedi all in order one on stream washed it together though uh
yeah i don't really care about the other ones off the top of my head like halo i don't i don't i
don't know nothing about it um but i do know that wolf would probably care about it so
cyberpunk is pretty cool you might get a record for longest efap to date i believe the longest
efap is still 11 hours right unless you mean longer singular efap which that could happen
that could happen excellent episode today glad you enjoyed my meme vid for your information vast
majority of wolf clips came from just the game of thrones rant and the efap after episode five
keep doing what y'all do that's good work mr gjm voices thank you very much and uh
we were all very happy with it it was very amusing molar and wolf what your problems with
the season four finale game of thrones just finished it and it felt off oh i got a couple
of problems joe jen reid's death is really stupid uh carrion's taisha plot is removed and replaced
with nothing so his actions don't make any sense the dialogue between brianne and the hound is
really dumb and it serves to only make them fight but specifically he's like hey is that lannister
steel and her response to something like jamie lannister gave me this yes it's like why don't
you tell him the context as to why he gave it to you instead of just letting it rebate vague
who'd be like are you gonna kill me with that gun and then i go i'm holding a gun yes
so you're sitting there like okay okay so you are yeah there's a couple things i didn't like about
it hey uh forward your garbage games your ox ox soy boy faces and your lifetime supply of
soylent you ugly diverse childless western devs j give me the elden ring i imagine that you have
to change a lot of the words so you can get past the senses of youtube at this point mr rah great
stream guys welcome back wolf you need to invite internet historian onto e-fair blow i mean i'd be
on board is that internet historian is the one with the funny face dude for the cringy thing right
or is that somebody else um i have no idea i can't remember i'm pretty sure i've seen internet
historian around we're okay with most guests pretty much here um can we get Godzilla versus
king gedora on e-fap movies lots of mean and rage potential especially from the dub also
thoughts on edf free fab gaming what's edf stand for what's here extra terrestrial fuckers
apparently it's a game edf elder elder cruel farming electric dinosaur fences
eldritch dinosaur it's gonna be dinosaur i know that much it's defense force apparently oh oh i
saw metal plane that with alex actually um yeah it's quite possible quite possible um also king
good we'll probably do the godzilla 98 movie and the 2019 movie the two we probably want to do on
e-fap movies we've got a lot of movies for e-fap movies to watch godzilla final wars goofy as hell
great e-fap movies material there's even a japanese dude with dreadlocks only for a moment though
there's a there's a dreadlocks man in in dark phoenix he was very strange that his power was
gangly weird dreadlocks that attack people i i don't know that was a weird one um can i get a
shout out my animations get like 300 views a piece uh cine animations is a channel that
does animations apparently uh if anyone in chat wants to check out some animations i actually i
think i recognize that name that's one of the people who did one of the memes
this one oh it was the one with the um guy who said he was a masterpiece three times in the window
i will post it in chat i'll link to that video and then subscribe to the channel or at least
check out the other videos if you're interested cine animations uh they've censored the hell out
of super chats new to code words for curse words like ryan dawson i don't know what that would be
a reference to mr cloud world poster vector is a bland one wasted christoph waltz that's part of
the reason why i didn't want to see it because i was like everyone kept saying they wasted christoph
waltz and i was like oh well i really like christoph waltz so now i don't want to see it
that works you're not supposed to waste christoph waltz that's the rules
can you watch the cyberpunk trailer on stream uh if if wolf and rags were still here i'd probably
do it but like i'm not too bothered by it as a whole so it's probably not worth it i'll just
sort of sit there watching it and be like well that was that and i shan't like to provide you
guys no kind of interesting commentary but if you're really interested we could probably do it
at the beginning of the next defap maybe casino royale is the best of the recent bonds but pretty
much anything pre tomorrow never dies is better than the new ones in my subjective opinion i've
not done a rewatch of james bond movies in a long time but i liked golden eye gold finger
a couple of other ones are my favorites and yeah casino royale is a big favorite from a lot of
people jesus molly is still going i've got 33 minutes to get the rest of these done how many
have i got oh my god god gotta get moving faster capitalism ho mola what's the gayest thing you've
ever done as a straight man myself the gayest thing i've ever done is take two black men in my ass
um i don't think i've done any any of the big gay
i don't think i've done many of the small gay in a little bit and once so that would be a small
guy right uh yes how much smaller than gay than that can you get like a tickle he tickled the
peen apparently bathista said they're bringing in human npc's into fallout 60 fallout 67 i'm
guessing you mean 60 26 and the crowd uh paused for it that's what wolf just sent me on on dick
cord it's actually discord and i said dick cord yeah that's funny i knew it was funny you didn't
laugh very fast though i'm starting to think you didn't find it funny at all would you rather slide
down a flagpole covered in razor blades would you rather slide down a flagpole covered in razor blades
or make love to an inside out porcupine sincerely mr massive so basically would i rather cut the
shit out of my hands the point where they might even fall off or make love to an inside out
porcupine uh i don't know losing your hands or your peen ween what would you choose yeah
uh the one that hurts the least i'd probably have to lose the peen ween because hands are
super useful i know the peen ween is super useful too but like oh that's tough
maybe if it's just in the future we can get a replacement peen ween or hands either way
i just watched the legal legal video i can explain why the guy is 100 in the wrong
do it but i didn't video i i i implore i implore any and all lawyers to have fun with it
i mean fuck you're really gonna make a successful channel responding to his
aches on things right anybody here know of any channels who are successful from responding to
one channel specifically at first like perhaps channels that cover film criticism
like perhaps channels like cinema sins being covered does anyone know of anyone who ever did
that i reckon i know a guy not here though so i'm i'm sure i'm mixing someone up it's probably
not a thing perion chronicles is on kindle for ten dollars it is the story of general
valka perion and his return to his empire hundreds of years after vanishing from malachai done uh
like i said findable on kindle for ten dollars there you are folks maula did a series covering
h bomber guy that's true the maula guy did do that did you see my doninator edit on twitter
uh it should have been right under the word of wolf street picture i may have missed it
if you want to send resend it i'll try and pop it into the next uh rotation rags need to chill
with a thirst bro rags needs a thirst quencher where did you think that he would have gone
yes not wearing costumes is normal in disney except for special events so
children don't confuse guests for cast members that could get dangerous i was gonna say if it's
something they do for most of their um things i wouldn't really be bothered um but if something
new that they're doing i would be like why is it taking you so long to implement this sounds like
it would be a problem regularly what would i know a bit behind but just so you know in alabama stand
your ground means you do you feel threatened on your property so um yeah i imagine alabama is more
uh you're allowed to shoot more in general with things from my very limited understanding
um but it's interesting how it changes between states the cocks of maula's heart are quite warm
indeed oh my goodness that's definitely a recent thing that i said so we're getting there
still got i still got like 20 minutes at least hey guys thanks for the wonderful stream help me
at work today also really glad to hear rags listens to doom cock keep up the great work
and thanks he did come on the stream for efap number number seven wait it was the major lee
one when we covered his video so yeah um i assume rags may have watched him from there or he's seen
him in recommended either way doom cock is a wonderful creator a scary creator do you think
there's a rose tico at a park at the park the park which park also yes whichever park you're
referring to sorry my brain is pretty melted right now i was up since 4am and we're nearly at 2am so
i'm coming full circle now you throw a milkshake you're thrown out of the helicopter while flying
naturally i mean is that an equal excessive force that probably seems like a bit much i don't know
throw him out of a helicopter for throw a milkshake i don't know i don't know i don't know man you got
to be fair and then again the lawyer will defend you in any case so you'll be fine yes maula i am
indeed an egyptian god now could you westoids cut out the bs and stop acting like the rulers
of my lands were black when the sahara separated us from them for ages when we made pyramids and
they made huts i mean hey that's pretty good they can provide a lot of heat pyramids are
good for like you know burying ancient rulers like who wants that just ancient rulers really
press f for maula yeah sure enough we wouldn't we're almost dead but i might be able to make it
y'all's content made me a better writer after watching you rip on bad writing and at a
breathing key plot points of the novel i wrote it's much better now i'll at you if i haven't
published it well again really really like to hear that sort of thing so thank you uh dan and
i hope that it really has helped that uh you will find success uh hey rags car sono or leon field
rifle i will copy and paste it oh my god guys it's le john wick in le cyberpunk i need to order
collector's edition with a lifetime supply of soylent i mean yeah it does seem like a selling
point but you know it could be really good and who doesn't love kiano reeves at this point he's
probably one of the most beloved celebrities there are didn't mean to promote twice in one episode
it's all right mark no problemo female anger is breathtaking he's been killing people
he's breathtaking he's been literally strangling people he's been stealing their breath
yeah jesus we should probably get somebody on e3 will know that mean i will know your meme
female anger is the weather vane of truth from dick masters and apparently interesting love your
work bro efaps solo is gold i mean i hope people have been entertained by this how long have i been
doing oh my goodness this has been like fucking three hours of super chess it's like longer than
most podcasts uh the unbridled rage should be reduced to a book reduced to a book i don't think
it's long enough to be a book as it is i never thought i'd hear you turn down money laugh my
ass off um you know money money isn't everything um i can't buy a fortier with money i can only
get one through like putting m&m's on a fishing rod and leading him into my house
yeah that's actually how we first uh got in touch with each other yeah i don't lie i do not
length is underrated when compared to depth therefore i shall donate to artificially
lengthen this stream wahaha we're getting getting close now i think
many how many that's your opinion still not really countable in an easy way
we're definitely getting there in a way uh why is fortier excited for spider-man doesn't
you know spider-man's coming out what's here i get it what did you explain i get it that's that's
what i thought that is what i am the last super chat at the time of me sending this that was true
that was true reaction to cyberpunk 2077 trailer i mean not on this stream but possibly in the
future um molar i went out drinking at 7 p.m bst and now i'm home and you're still going that's
cool bruh um yeah we've it's seven and a half hours stream i watched lord of the rings
return of the king today i've not done anything to do with human life today other than eyes staring
at a screen it's bad for you but it's ultimately good for you because um have you heard about this
if you like if you watch a screen for hours on end without any breaks it'll improve your eyesight and
intelligence by 10 i heard it turns your uh face square my parents actually used to tell me that
when i was a kid i was so fucking terrified yeah mine actually did the same uh try bringing
thor skywalker on efap soon please i have heard of his channel we're not against that we'll uh
maybe look into that too hey for tier is it considered necrophilia if your partner is alive
when you start um if you divide the the constant by six then yes i believe it is yeah you carry the one
sorry did you carry the one um no i think that is nullified by i'm pretty sure it's binary the
second that they're dead it counts as that everyone knows this is what you just said was some kind of
math thing that no one believes in your crazy religion you look at that you've even freaked
out chat you know how long it takes to do that this chat is very resilient to these sorts of things
finally out of p is a song oh wait i'm sorry chat i don't think it was you i think it was the super
chat mr molar are there any movies you consider objectively good but dislike there there are i've
forgotten what they are because i've answered this question before a while ago um is it the
inception one of them uh or is it the missed opportunity oh hey maybe i guess i could count
done kick i think that's a good film but i don't really care about then again i would criticize
its characters i don't know that's complicated uh that's complicated i'd have to really have
a good look around because the problem is i tend to forget movies that don't interest or or stimulate
me as as most people would probably feel um the ones i love and hate will often stay in memory
for much longer um yes hopefully that question is answered over the coming effaps as we discover
and talk about more movies and stuff um oh yeah chip chipley did the did the emotes end up working
for you don't know i didn't check if they uh if they had we need a skull on wheels emote um i
could probably sort that out actually i will make a note i don't know how well it would work though
because it would be so small but we'll look into it see what happens oh you can put them in super
chats as well that's neat um aris feins in 391 bc don't give women control they'll destroy the
world a bunch of chosen women in the 20th century that's a sextisms give us power
keep your enthusiasm theme starts playing i mean i don't think it's as simple as that
god of the sun how could you say such things a jury would never take that seriously
hello mouse china department like i said there are juries though what i guess
this channel is satire uh uh do not
more sad do not shower us we actually like the last jedi we're mocking white supremacy susan
we promised to call off the call off the snipers oh i understand um i meant what state the sea
oh yeah i read that out portia why has god blessed me with three nipples
uh because he obviously loves you more than everyone else and there's the amount of nipples
is equivalent to uh god's love for you oh wow is that rags when did you join oh
20 minutes ago hi we've actually got literally like 10 minutes left before we capped out on the
stream and i've only got a couple left i can do this yeah um hey just saw you started six
hours ago nice job kisses it's actually seven hours and 40 minutes according to obs
yes suggestions critical thinker drunk 3po both good content creators and good dudes also have
you ever had any desire to get back into animation like the game grumps potential i always liked
animation but um i was never good enough for it from my perspective for how much time i was trying
to spend into it and i was just like it's it's something i find really fun and charming but
i don't think i have the time but i would like to get good at it and then create animations
animations are cool and yes critical drinker and uh i don't i don't think i know drunk 3po is but
again both of them would probably be uh good guests from from what i understand um i'm doing
this to put the stream to the eight hour mark wow how dare you artistique uh hi rag from blue j
hi uh mauler please make a series ripping into neo it's making me hate gaming itself
uh i didn't really care about neo that much i'm not really the guy to uh to do it you know
eldon ring release when miyazaki make more games damn it give him time oh god Bethesda presser is
on and it's pure tism right now want us to think they're all about the fans they aren't want us to
believe how bad they feel about the sorry state of fallout 76 we won't but we're gonna get like a
super chat about the Bethesda fucking e3 so close to the end do this mola you could just do
a gray wimtism and make love to a porcupine with your fingers or are you assuming you need
a peep to make love hello sexism and transphobia pill department i assumed that was in the rules
i just i assumed that's my bad i didn't think you'd let me do a finger alone that's you know
chat i can't believe you turned down money laugh my ass off mola it's not about the money it's
about sending a message or a massage both would work oh he corrected it to message
and then another one that says hi rags hi and then another one that says hi rags
he didn't say hi back i'm sorry eric yes i did no i said i said there was two of them
oh there were oh whoa whoa who was the second uh the first was ryan the second was eric
ryan and eric are they brothers uh definitely
all right then cori thank you for the new membership why thank you cori oh i don't want
to have to pronounce that surname me neither that's why i just said cori you guys are still
going can't wait to watch later yeah nearly finished rags i got void bastards bloody hell
is it fun another fun game i'm glad you're really liking it i dig it too i think it's a great game
wish you guys had streamed with boogie such a shame i mean maybe one day he'll guest on efap who
knows it's funny it's funny i liked mauler but as i watched efap i've come to love rags enjoy
listening to you long oh wow see his his curiosity has bloomed into amorous love and admiration he
came for the mauler but stayed for the rags story the story of life itself um then you got hello rago
from taylor no response to that never mind uh rago hate to rago why yeah perhaps he's referring
to ragu which is a kind of like a like a sauce oh and i can tell you all about the sauce if you
need me to i think i think good yeah it goes good on the tortellini i got killing floor two so i can
shoot you in the back later oh that's wonderful that's wonderful you can you can actually make the
art a reality wait there's no friendly fire and killing floor is there no maybe not you can't
stream with him mauler it's too late i'm pretty sure boogie would you know be able to do a different
day if he wanted to um and yeah and then i've got there's a selection of things for you rags that
i've got on this notepad we've only got like 10 minutes maybe i can get through them quickly with
you the first one is hi rags hi i think a lot of people like saying that to you i'm starting to
notice this as a pattern now um oh well give the people what they want um the next one was oh rags
them you beautiful doggo i love you so oh really well we haven't met yet but i'm sure that our um
i'm sure that your love will turn into well love is a two-way street
uh recommendation for for all three of us uh it was love death and robots love death and robot
i think it has popped up on on the street uh on the show before but uh rags your new
intro added several years to my lifespan ooh were they human years or dog years
yeah i guess it would be better if it was human years but no either way i imagine it probably
was it's that high quality rags this is clearly consoles beat pc because i have to serve my
corporate overlord that was a super not the worst reason i've seen yeah help rags i got caught in
my own zipper again you know what just accept the fact that you know that story of ichris
and daedalus instead of don't think of it as like your wax wings are having a big ass dick
yeah so take the good little bad uh do you guys have any favorite movies with a focus with the
visuals or music like space odyssey or fantasia and obviously that's uh a portion of it is for
you to answer so what do you have you got any where like music's a big thing in it yeah all visuals
hmm well music specific i mean i like the fantasia stuff uh
i thought um man well visuals is oh there's a lot for visuals music's a lot harder
because it's way easier nowadays to you dazzle people with the spectacle i mean look at look at
the godzilla movie you know that looked great movie was crap otherwise how dare you
um so yeah is there any movie that comes to mind other than the examples or that you i guess
called zilla counts then the imaginarium of dr parnassus was really visually interesting
we watched eternal sunshine of a spotless mind that had some nifty stuff going for it simple
but it was played really really well and i liked it a lot um i've always liked the blade runner
kind of visuals and sound i think sound was always a big part of blade runner made it really great
but i'm sure there's more um i just have to like think about it you know rags my man everything
right to western progressives is collectively conservative alt nazi right don't bother looking
for present definitions on google read old books on the matter
i can't remember what i was in reference to but i'm guessing it was to do with the fucking legal
legal guy i don't know maybe uh would rags be able to shoot someone beating him considering he
is his own dog oh that's very good i i believe so i i think so i think if they hand i think if
they'll pass the license out to me they're basically giving me uh giving me that kind of power
um i knew this was directed at you but uh it simply said i volunteer for the hate fucking
oh boy got a got a taker there uh seeing as the three of you are pc gamers uh so obviously this
will just be your portion of this uh what games would you recommend for someone who's relatively
new to the platform and he must have exclusives or good multi-platform games
we're new to pc gaming um unironically minecraft is one that everybody is a game that probably
everybody should have um i would highly recommend the witcher 3 as a game divinity original sin 2
is a good strategy game that uh works really really well with the pc ui uh the civilization
games are pretty good i'd recommend five let me see if you're new to pc civilization might be
something you want if you're well well it's not that no if you're new to pc that's it's like ui
and controls and stuff but civilization is really good because it really helps to introduce you to
the mouse and keyboard click things learn shortcuts kind of uh kind of gameplay because there's a lot
of stuff going on it's not fast paced though so you don't it's not like you have to learn this stuff
on the fly or anything you can take all the time that you need but it really utilizes a lot of
you know pc gaming's you know its strengths it really takes advantage of its ui
so i'd recommend that uh uh games like i would i would say try a game that you played on console
before but play it on pc and see the difference that'll really help because it'll be a familiar
kind of experience but you know just the hardware and peripherals will just be the only different
thing so that'll that'll probably help you settle into a new system really well um rags is
it a coincidence that the whitest male of apex legends characters uses gas it must be a coincidence
i don't know what that would be a reference to i doubt it's that serious but yes uh i already
know this from wolf as he tends to talk about subject more often but what would be rags his
favorite books
my favorite books um i really like the lord of the rings the alchemist um i really did like
atlas shrugged um i've liked let me see the first couple harry potter books i really liked
but i was really young when i read them so that might have colored the whole thing um let me see
favorite books it's been a while there's been a lot of short stories that i've read and really
liked i'm a big fan of the fan the foundation trilogy hammer of god um there's been a fair
number of stuff but i've read a lot of short stories science fiction has played a huge role
in you know a lot of my reading list from earlier but i think that's it oh the stand
i love the stand i thought that was really good yeah uh i watched one of rags uh one fish two fish
red fish blue fish is a classic and i'd recommend everybody oh of course my favorite book of all
time was count of money christo can't believe i forgot that that's my favorite book ever is the
count of money christo love it love fish the blue fish blue one fish two fish blow fish blue
fish is the thing that i know because that's a simpsons episode name just reminded me of it
i was like oh that's probably where that comes from then um i watched one of rags's videos and
the next day my recommended was filled with every massive on youtube does that mean youtube is
homophobic every man really like who i would be curious to know who exactly because i don't like
tag my stuff lgbt or anything like that yeah who knows what they mean by massive that could be mean
wolf i don't know like everyone's a massive on this show uh i didn't think he got enough credit
so shout out to rags for that hilarious boon on jennifer lawrence saying she sounded more like an
ex-wife remember saying that it wasn't a joke i do i read it from the chat i can't take credit for
that oh okay no no no i i read it from the comments the comments on the video it was that
one of the comments on the video yeah that wasn't me i didn't want that to come across like and it
was the last super chat that was related to you hey rags i don't know if it's pronounced correctly
casano or leon field rifle i don't know i i haven't used either all right oh carcano oh
i don't know i haven't used either of them so i couldn't i can't say can't say
um and just to catch the last few uh 10 minute part two of this stream here we come no i've
still got four minutes so we nearly made it molly you don't get it he's not with us anymore
i'm not sure who you're referring to rags talks about dicks more incessantly than a whorish girl
with daddy issues um well i am neither a hoary girl nor do i have daddy issues and the second
question would be is that a problem i i just don't think so you know it's it's it's it's beautiful
i'm sorry i i fucking like dick that's how i just did a conference and i'm here throwing money in a
degenerate sodomite dog a white supremacist gas mask and one normal guy what is life

guess um sorry for the people we'll have to wait like 10 years for this to process to finally be
able to see the beginning of it if you want to see this before i end up putting it up on moolah check
the description the discord link and then it'll in the announcement section you'll be able to get
a link to the unlisted version or just hang on to the url you have right now and just refresh it
