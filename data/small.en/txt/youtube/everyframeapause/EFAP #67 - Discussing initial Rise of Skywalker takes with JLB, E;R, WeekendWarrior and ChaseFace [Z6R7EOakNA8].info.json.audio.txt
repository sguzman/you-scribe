Oh, it's like everyone hates you.
So your parents, you're sorry, your kids, I mean, obviously,
your parents are disappointed in you, but your kids especially
are going to look back on all that and be like, man,
our dad was a fucking Jack in any Jack.
He was a butt plug.
Total one plug.
He was a butt plug.
But I mean, what if his son came out one day and said the whole boulder thing?
That was a fucking lie.
Oh, it's his secret shame.
Oh, my God.
Like his his kids side against him.
They have to bring back the family name.
It's like Palpatine.
His kid chooses a different name instead of Jarvo.
Can I be like Matt's son, Palpatine?
He chooses like something really just terrible.
That's what he wants to get rid of.
He's just like glugglton or something.
He's like, I'll take it here.
Jarbo is an embarrassing name anyway.
It sounds like a fucking circus freak.
Jarbo, the amazing bearded Jarbo, the bearded Jarbo.
I'm surprised to go with bearded Thumb Rags, but his attraction, bearded Thumb.
We are live and I managed to fix the chat and the thumbnail really quick.
Yeah. Oh, man.
All that high quality content.
You're never going to know.
And this will be our last episode rags.
I'm sad face now.
We're open on the floor.
We're spreading the Christmas cheer by shitting all over other content creators.
I don't just like Jesus would have done.
We're not going to do it like a new year's show, are we?
So, yeah, this is it.
We're not.
I don't know, are we?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Let's discuss it now.
All right. Let's discuss it now.
All right.
Mahler, you want to do a new year's show?
I'm not against the idea.
All right. Good talk.
Yeah, moving on.
So long defab number 67.
We have passed order 66, and I'm still terrified about how we can really satisfy
the audience on episode 69.
Like, what are we supposed to do, Rags?
What was what is what is the goal with that one?
Yeah, probably just just suck each other's cocks.
Yeah. All right.
Well, yeah, I thought that would be I thought that was going to be harder.
But you came up with a very easy answer.
I don't know how I got the idea in my head.
We're joined by we got a full cast once again celebrating the end of the year
with all these people who have been here before.
This is impossible to introduce you individually.
So I'm just going to do it all the same time.
What is it?
Yeah, abbreviated it's Jobel Kefir.
They're all I thought you were.
I thought you're going to be like, I'm going to say all their names at once.
Yeah, just that's what I thought.
I was kind of I was kind of looking forward to see given that a try.
How can I say four things at once?
That's impossible.
Um, that's the that's what good writing is, smaller.
Well, I could do it if I had time to edit myself.
You know what subtext is?
That's a metanarrative idiot.
Metanarrative.
So you don't even know what Star Wars is about.
You just watch it.
Oh, look at my family.
Is it, though?
That's why it's great.
Is it about family when she literally turns it back on her beloved Palpatine
and chooses a different family?
What's that about?
Hmm.
It is weird that the last shot I was supposed to supposedly about family.
And the message of this one was, you know,
fuck you, isn't thicker than water.
Water is much thicker than water.
Choose your own family.
That's how wonderful it is.
You make your own family, guys.
Ew.
What do you mean?
You make your own family, though.
Yeah, you can.
Yeah.
That's someone I'm in your family now.
Smile.
Just do it all the way now, to say the least.
Well, in your family, I am.
Yes, I guess I'll give it a shot, though.
I'm going to go for quickly.
What? Oh, sorry.
Now you can go ahead.
No, what the fuck are you going to say, Chase?
Come on.
Why is this fun?
It was important enough to start.
It's important enough to finish.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I was just going to say I'm more of a video game guy.
I barely know anything about Star Wars,
but I did see this movie.
I did not financially contribute to it.
So I feel better about that.
Wow, I should have kept that to yourself.
Yeah, you fucking thief.
I want to tell Papa Disney.
I'll be the idiot occasionally asking questions, like, what?
What's a Skywalker?
What are Jedi?
So this Rey person, she's like, she's the best character,
I suppose.
Saga's been all about her, I guess.
From the beginning, when George started it all in, what,
77?
It was all about Rey.
He didn't know it, but it was all about Rey.
Imagine, like, there was a clip, this little, like,
old style and shit, and they're on set for Empire Strikes Back.
And you just get a clip of George being like,
you know, I want all of this to really lead to Rey.
That's the important part.
Like, what the fuck?
Like, George, no.
Like, Catholic.
He's like, see?
He ruined it.
Not me.
See?
It was George all along.
Jorge.
So yeah, I guess I will do the whole, like, one by one.
I'm going to go from right to left on my screen.
My screen's the important screen, just so you know.
So Chase Face, hello there.
You've got a Christmasy avatar.
That means you win.
You won.
Cool.
Thank you.
How are you?
What's happening?
Woke up about an hour ago.
Didn't get a lot of sleep, because I stayed
up late watching JoJo.
Yeah, hi.
How is Joseph Jones?
Well, I'm not going to spoil anything,
but let's just say part three, highly overrated, come at me.
Oh, my goodness.
You don't even know what JoJo.
We can worry.
You've got a response to that.
We talked about Joseph Joseph.
Beat him up, Joseph.
Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, even if it's wrong.
There you go.
Listen to me, you little fucking shit.
I've better taste than you.
You fucking perch.
I disagree.
So, Molly, did you know that the reason the reason they're
called JoJo is because their last names are Joestar,
and then the first character is like Joseph,
and then Jonathan, Joseph, Joe Taro, Josuke.
So that's like the meme is that I can't wait to see
this wonderful show.
Wow.
So their names are all familiar.
If you can't get your protagonist's name properly,
I don't know that I'm going to commit.
That's just IMO.
IMO.
Yeah, IMO.
IMO.
Fair.
But yeah, speaking of the piss and who
despises your perspective on anime, weekend warrior, welcome.
How do you do?
Hello.
I despise his perspective.
Yay.
We will be fighting this entire stream.
Oh, great.
I think this is a personal joke at all.
Battle lines are drawn.
Yeah, exactly.
I mean, I know that the Efap audience would be like,
anime podcast, yes.
And we're going to be like, no, no.
No.
No.
Just some random weaves.
If ever there's anime.
You guys wrong.
Podcast, it'll have to do my homework for ages.
There are not enough dollars in the cosmos.
What is a waifu?
Silence waifu.
It's a waifu.
It's like the modern communion.
It's like the body of a waifu.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would want a Jesus waifu.
Yeah.
Oh.
Jesus cookie.
So anime is very Christian, is what you're saying.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, it's got a lot of Christian ties.
Oh, OK.
A lot of it.
Learn it in a lot.
Imagery.
The subtext is.
I know stuff about laser swords and space wizards,
but I don't know a lot about animu.
That's my weakness, if you will.
I will teach you.
OK, so I will teach you.
The ways of the weeb.
Big guest is the wonderful Jay Longbone, who loves anime.
Talk a bit about it.
Yeah.
The only anime I've truly watched all the way through
is Death Note.
The one with the fucking the middle age giants.
Oh.
Wait, is that my last story?
Right.
Very descriptive attack on death.
And I might have seen in a little bit of Dragon Ball Z.
Not bad, not bad.
Decent spread.
Decent selection.
How are you?
How has your crimp-onium been?
Oh, yeah, I've been good.
Holidays have been good so far.
Did you?
Oh, you watched Infinite Crisis, part one, right?
Oh, yeah.
Have you watched more of it yet?
No.
Infinite Crisis.
So, yeah, I guess update on that.
Those those are stuck in copyright hell
on the website of things.
I'm going to get them sorted as soon as I'm done with my
my next video that I'm currently working on.
Oh, I could probably talk more about that toward the end.
But yeah, it's wonderful, isn't it?
Did you see episode two yet?
The Batwoman episode was episode two.
Oh, right. Right. Apparently.
You have to keep keep your keep it straight, Mahler.
Fucking I know there's so much there's so much quality
that it when I found out that episode five
was the Legends of Tomorrow episode, I was like,
what the hell does that mean?
That's a TV show filled with like an Avengers ripoff team.
I was like, oh, is it cold?
But the hot they both have guns that fire cold and hot.
That's OK.
They're a team.
They're called freezer burn.
Oh, nice. I like it.
I'm not watching that shit.
Oh, me, frame, metal and rags are all excited to see how it's going to end.
I can't wait.
I can't wait to see what happens to these beloved characters.
I can't wait to see your reactions.
That's a fucking good ass series.
You guys got going on, man.
It is a wild ride to the Zooms, the Zooms really make
the ridiculous reactions extra worth it.
Never would have thought you'd work with you with your little circle pictures.
And yet it's like animated to a point where it actually feels like
they're ideal or something.
I like when you predict something and you just put the text
on with the piano, like, why do we even bother?
We don't even use screens.
Because it's written in an afternoon by subdued.
It was like, hey, I can do this.
I can't wait.
I learned this in college film school.
And yes, last but not least, Mr.
E.R., how do you do so?
I do very well.
How's have you been?
You got a choice of subjects, you know, anime, Christmas
or infinite crisis.
You can talk about any of those three things.
I choose anime. Isn't that why I was brought on?
Mm hmm. All right.
This is the.
And diabetes is one of the best enemies available.
Yes. Finally, a good take.
Did it getting sour reviews from different people?
That's just, you know, they don't understand the deeper themes,
the better textual narratives.
Yeah, the layers of diabetes is the gluten.
Much like the fold of diabetes, diabetes,
character, like what would be his fucking that would be?
No, his character arc would be like the mathematical arc of his rotundness.
Mm hmm. Like many degrees.
That's his arc.
Once they discover his radius, they'll be like, he'll get a new power.
And you would be mistake if you were close enough to diabetes.
You would be forgiven for thinking that he was flat.
Like this is not actually a massive globe.
The season three cliffhanger is things start to orbit him.
And he's like, no, like at first he likes it
because small things float towards him like snacks and other food items.
But then it's, you know, living animals.
And well, not actually, I probably wouldn't stop him.
A scissors starts to come toward him and he's like, good lord.
And that's that's where it cuts.
And it says directed by, you know, Steven Spielberg.
It's so many pops like a balloon.
Well, we don't know yet. Season four is an outrags.
What do you mean? Oh, my God.
I read the leaks on the extensive, the extensive leaks.
I want to say really quickly, not to deviate from diabetes too much,
but people in chat are saying that Cowboy Bebop, very good anime.
Yes. Anyone who has not seen anime and would like to explore
and make a foray into that genre.
Cowboy Bebop is very normie friendly.
That's a pretty bold take there.
Pretty controversial saying that anime is a great anime.
I know. It's very underrated opinion.
When we all know the best one is
what's the typically known horrible anime chase?
I can say it make it funny.
Sword Art Online. It's not.
I don't even I don't even I don't even watch anime, but I know that. Yep.
I watch the that's the one where the video game ever gets trapped inside, right?
Yeah, it's like a VR MMO life.
So that's the first anime I was ever showed.
No wonder I got put off.
Yeah, no, it's bad. Music's good about it.
I've told the story on the streams before, but like a friend of mine
who really wanted to start watching anime, that was one of his favorites.
And the crazy weird thing was we watched the first couple
and I was like, this is meh.
Then he was like, no, no, it gets better.
We finished episode six or seven and I still wasn't into it.
And he said, well, there's no point now because it only gets worse.
And I was like, oh, we stopped.
Well, I guess.
Mahler, you sci fi man, you know, you need a fucking an anime
about a bunch of anime characters in an MMO wanting to fuck each other
and making really bad decisions.
That seems like your forte to see how this could ever go south.
Well, I mean, I got my fill of that sort of thing from South Park,
that one episode where they're in World of Warcraft. This is close enough.
It's a good episode.
We just make love, not war craft.
I think it's like one of the top rated episodes of all time for this show.
It's really good.
Even though I'm showing what World of Warcraft experts
probably like, that doesn't make sense.
Yeah, that's not lore friendly.
You know what? They they would be.
I would accept it.
I would just be like, but remember, South Park, it doesn't make sense as a whole.
The reaction from Chad is making me want to just like
schedule a separate efap where it's just like me, weekend warrior
and maybe a couple other people.
And we just like fucking debate anime opinions.
Well, me and Ryan are just sitting in the background making comments.
Yeah, one in the chat if that's something like, oh, sure.
She's definitely a two thousand year old dragon spirit.
Is that the one where they fly at the one with the laces?
That's a never ending story.
The anime.
Oh, yeah, I know.
This thing is so sad because, I mean, we just we we watch stuff
like the Mandalorian.
I mean, you're a good real anime instead of fake crappy
normie anime like Jojo's or whatever.
But you say that, but the Mandalorian is kind of become like an anime.
What do you mean, Rags?
Here we go.
Could this be his most controversial take?
Mandalorian shit.
Oh, what?
And if you like it, you're wrong.
If you like it, then you've been fooled by the mouse.
Wait, why is everyone saying one? What happened?
I said, say one, if you'd like us to fucking have like a separate
anime podcast, even luckily, the things that you say don't count.
That's true. That's true.
I say it as no bearing on any official.
You know, there was things we could just just ignore that like it didn't even happen.
There's an underrated comment earlier.
I wanted to read out that said have you say very similar to.
Very similar to you know, the hard part was probably in the sentence.
You had to read it out in, wasn't it?
Hmm. Well, I've had a lot of practice, a lot of practice.
Good memes.
Good, good, good, good, good.
Yeah, we actually plan to have a Mandalorian podcast at some point
once we set it all up.
But today we were going to be talking about good old fashioned.
Stair was or we're going to be talking about the good Star Wars.
Eyes of Skywalker.
The very good Star Wars.
Let's do our initial like roundtable thing.
You know, if have knows me and Rags perspective on it.
But you four folks, what's what's give you mini reviews?
Who would like to go first?
It's garbage volunteering.
Oh, whoa, whoa, calm down.
How could you say that?
Our children watching.
May I go first?
Just because my opinion will probably be you won't be first.
Jay Long, you would now be second.
Oh, I didn't even know the tension.
Get rich from actively.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
It's OK.
Like we could edit this bit out.
So we'll edit it out.
We'll edit it out. Yeah.
First up is Jay's face.
So how much did you enjoy Rise of Skywalker?
Uh, not too much.
It's a very busy.
Too much comedy.
A lot of sort of Ghostbusters esque improv.
Yeah, too much comedy.
I don't think there was enough.
I know I laughed a lot of it like I definitely laughed at the C3PO parts,
but I was like, man, yeah, no, the C3PO parts were good
where he's just like, you didn't ask, but I'm fine.
Like that part was like, but yeah, that's it.
That's the height of the comedy of the film that's intended.
You go, yeah, well, a little,
you know, a little bit about Bauman and breathing out of breathing air out of my nose.
Mm hmm.
Fucking Kylo Ren is like he has like a lot of neck fat
when he's trying to look really serious and fights and he left it out for me.
He's just a soggy human.
Like, that's how. Yeah, he's a fucking soggy person.
It doesn't help that he's covered in seawater for half the local
like random mile and in PE class and just is struggling to exist with it.
That's about it.
Next person.
It was better than The Last Jedi, but it's like asking
which piece of shit you want to eat. It's.
You thought it was better.
That's the controversial subject right now.
I like it. Creamy.
Just just because it shat on Ryan Johnson that that.
It's a fair enough reason.
Yeah, I thought there were parts that I found entertaining.
Like there are bits and pieces that were good.
Like I think the worst part of it is that when they were bantering,
I could feel that they could have developed a nice friendship,
but everyone really fucked it up because they didn't plan this whole trilogy.
So there you go developing friendships.
Oh, yeah, it's about family.
Yeah, they have irritation.
Irritation. That's what Star Wars is about.
Um, you know, you're the only one left.
I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to ask what do you
what you thought of the rise of the Skywalker?
I thought it was the best.
Of all of them.
Even better than the last Jedi, even better than the Phantom Menace.
Those are very close, especially the last Jedi.
You know, maybe we can argue that.
Um, the the from what I tell a lot of people seem to I mean,
people who like to obviously thought the rise of Skywalker was worse,
but our community was split right down the middle on that vote.
They they feel as though they're both really just pieces of shit.
And I'm not going to be the one to say no to that.
I think that that's true.
Legit surprised at how incredibly even the hatred
was dispensed between the two movies.
It's like poetry.
It is like poetry.
So we've got a whole.
Well, I say a whole selection.
We've got three options in terms of who to approach
for the rise of Skywalker take.
Now, I don't I don't necessarily have a preference
on which one we approach first.
I don't know if what do you guys reckon if we let the chat choose
or if we just sort of decide between ourselves?
Yeah, go for it.
I mean, chats never steered us wrong before.
Yep. Are they not?
Audience interaction is fun. Yeah.
I would be curious.
I would kind of be curious as to who they would want us to cover first, though.
Yeah. All right.
Well, the the options are I was I was going to put movie Robert
and I was like, no, diabetes.
Oh, I have to do nicknames for this man.
You got diabetes, Quentin and mundane Matt,
all with a fiery hot take about, I guess, the state of this movie.
This is going to be good.
So we can, you know, I'll drop it in for you guys first.
You get first dibs on the boat.
Oh, boy. This is where the fun begins.
It's too much potential.
Oh, man. All right.
OK. Oh, my goodness.
I'll post it in chat in a moment.
Get ready to vote. All right.
But we should have one, two, three.
We should have six votes here. We got three.
OK, so really for clarification, what do you mean precisely by consume?
To watch. Oh, what did you think that meant?
Do you mean we were going to eat the person?
Yeah, like like like absorbing the door.
OK, yeah.
And gain their powers, in which case a loss of Quentin and diabetes.
Oh, you know, there's there's there's some stuff for all of them.
All right. And I shall put the results on the screen now.
So exciting. I know.
It's you know, you do you see all these votes porn in the like
and like the live
the percentage versus actually like IRL moving.
I like watching the bars move.
Look at them like, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
I like seeing the numbers go up.
That is, you know, close to equalizing.
Yeah, there really is.
Keep it steady, guys.
It's like bouncing the likes and dislikes on a channel.
Could this video get to that?
Yeah, that's a little bit closer than I thought it'd be.
Oh, wow.
And they had continues to be irrelevant.
Both diabetes.
He's up against diabetes than you.
And in diabetes, like he gets people to quit our streams because the headaches.
He's going to rather watch him.
If diabetes wins, I reserved the right to get some whiskey first.
It looks like he's going.
He's currently. Oh, God. Here we go again.
I think Monday has lost his his chance.
Oh, rip, rip the boulder.
The story of his life.
Take that, Jorbo.
Jada Bo.
I will. I'll post it one more time in case people like that fuck is the link.
Why? Why?
But why? It's like it's like watching.
We should have put down bets for what the chat we're going to do.
Yeah, it's gambling on it.
They beat us the season finale villains.
I mean, he's going to be the series finale village. Yeah.
We've never seen Diabito acquit of the same room.
They're obviously the same guy.
There's a chance.
Is there any chance that like one of your fans can make
like some deep fap lore and Diabito is like the Palpatine of our series?
Because I would fucking genuinely enjoy that.
He's been pulling the strings or the sugar from the beginning
and hoarding the insulin to unkempt men
with terrible movie takes never seen in the same room together.
Monday, Matt, on the other hand,
they different, different entirely that doesn't apply to him.
Monday, Matt's.
Oh, yeah, fuck. You're right.
I forgot about Monday, Matt.
Just just the world. Oh, no.
Well, should we give them how long should we give them?
It's pretty close, but I'll have to do some kind of like we stop now or something.
Three minutes, three minutes.
All right, fine.
I'm going to get my little vlog.
I'll wait for it to go.
1943. That's what I'm waiting for.
No, 1944. Yeah.
Good year.
As soon as it says that I will.
Oh, that is when the the the the choice will have been decided.
The suspense is killing me.
It's undeniably incredibly intense. Yes.
I'm starting to think that people might be trying to like level
the two of them just to see what happens.
We play both videos at the same time.
Oh, great.
Oh, yeah, they're neck and neck.
Do you think Quinton and diabetes would get along?
No, no, no, no, no one.
I don't think diabetes just can't get along with people.
YouTubers in general.
YouTubers are so fucking up their own asses.
I don't think anyone with like a strong opinion would get along
with anyone else with a really strong opinion.
I felt that way about all five of you. Yes.
Yeah, great.
You're not wrong.
Um, oh, no, Monday, Matt, you could do it, buddy.
Come on, give us that.
Give us an amazing opinion on.
Just anything.
We just got Quinton and diabetes sprinting ahead.
We're watching which one's going to win, but that's like something
for once in your life.
Diabetes sprinting, you sure? Rolling.
You know, when Magneto does the he like lifts up,
he's that's what he's doing just really slowly, I guess.
I will give the link out one last time.
So if you want to, you know, you want to get in on this,
you want to get your hero covered on eFAB out of these three people
because I know they've got a lot of fans and vote now.
Say it ain't so.
Wait, Quinton pulled in front of diabetes now. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
But actually, it might be less less draining to go in that order.
Oh, maybe. I mean, if you if you were to.
What did you vote for, everybody? What's your reason?
I voted. I voted for Quinton.
Because I voted Quinton, too.
I voted. I think he's going to have some some funny things to say.
While Diabeto's movie review will probably just be like,
he has no fucking clue of what everyone's actually upset or happy about.
He'll just like it.
It has to go in a certain order, like joy, headache, joy. Mm hmm.
Is it a joy to have a Monday mat?
Oh, you mean Quinton, Diabeto and then Monday met.
Is it? Well, OK, the question stats, is it a joy to cover Monday, man?
Do you find it to be joyful?
Is he a joyful person?
I mean, he's funny.
You know what? You're right.
Well, we're at 44.
I think the Quintins have it.
Hooray. How exciting.
The Cues have it.
Hope you proud of yourself, everybody.
When we go through this video, everyone did a chat.
You did it, chat. You did it. You did it, guys.
Why did you do it? Great work.
Here's a link for all of you to jump inside.
It will take you to a whole watch together.
Wait, that beato was defeated.
Oh, no. Can't even win a race in like a metaphorical sense.
No one's going to mention it, but they're about losing.
It's like, well, we know that naturally.
No, no shit.
I guess, yeah, Quinton can be all warm up.
Keep boulders, Matt.
Is is everybody in?
Well, you know, I'm not.
Oh, my God. I want to ask is
does my mind look at all this editing?
Oh, God, look at him.
Oh, it's probably cool.
You know, OK, you know that
you know that Spongebob episode, the old one,
where the big green fish comes into the Krusty Krab and what a sentence.
And he can never be satisfied
no matter how excellent the food is made.
That's what Clinton looks like now.
You know, I'm talking about I don't know enough Spongebob memes.
I'm so sorry. Yeah, I mean.
I believe you.
All right.
Is everyone seeing the word spoilers on the screen?
Yes. Yes.
So everyone, if you don't want to have the rise of Skywalker
spoiled for you, please.
Stay super quick before we get into it.
I want to ask this.
Does my mic sound kind of crappy and like staticky or like low quality?
It's mostly OK.
Sounds fine. It's really just the opinions that are low quality.
Because I was going to say, for some reason, Discord does that.
But my mic is the same exact settings as when I record for my videos.
So apparently the character's name was Bubble Bass ranks.
Bubble Bass.
Quinton is Bubble Bass.
Still no pickles.
Is that something he says?
I don't know.
Still no pickle.
All right.
Let the opinions begin.
So, yeah, context, right?
This is our first ever podcast finally covering what you could call
crappy video essays of Rise of Skywalker.
Me and Rise have been doing this for like nearly two years for TLJ.
Finally, we get to evolve as critics and cover the next one.
The sequel. So here we go.
Quinton, you know, he's he's like the inaugural video essayist.
Even I don't even know if you can call this that.
I don't really care.
I just find it pretentious, which is, you know, he nails it.
So here goes, guys, exciting stuff.
All right. Get on with it.
I mean, it's a good time.
It's been 12 seconds.
We could read the one word.
But it's a primer.
It's like, this is what you're going to leave now.
Guys, funny joke, funny joke time.
Come on. Wait, wait.
Oh, OK, guys.
You know, if you smell stories backwards, it's Sirely Ops.
Nice. Got him.
Yeah. So you're fucked.
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.
Oh, that was funny.
You should have done that.
He's still got this acoustic tiles.
You don't fucking need acoustic tiles.
I don't have acoustic tiles.
Yeah. Do you have acoustic tiles?
No, but a professional has acoustic tiles.
I haven't had time.
So if if I sound like bad, it's if I sound as bad as I look,
it's because I don't have my acoustic tiles set up.
Is that how you spell acoustic?
Yeah, no, because one acoustic is he's not three.
Wait, what?
No, well, yeah, I thought it was spelled acoustic.
Maybe it's a British.
Maybe it's British spelling.
No, he's retarded.
No, did you mean?
Yeah, then it asked if if I meant acoustic.
Yeah, no, he spelled it wrong.
I'm pretty sure it's got I've never seen it spelled that way.
But no, acoustic with three C's is on Dumptionary dot com.
What is that?
I guess it's where the dumb people spell.
Yeah, there's yeah.
It's a you see, here's a here's a picture right there.
It's on the double because if I type in the one with a double C,
it just links me to the correct one.
That's all. Are you sure you didn't mean the right word?
I like that.
That one says like, hey, idiot, like, oh.
All right.
I mean, maybe that's the joke because,
you know, the font and then the non capitalized.
Yeah, you know.
And this smiley face and sad face.
Yeah, there you go.
Got it. There you go.
Yeah, let's let's throw him a bone.
Whatever they go.
Oh, yeah.
So I can't wait for the take about how there's a three hour podcast.
And all they talked about was my spelling of acoustic.
Well, I've seen I saw his his ContraPoints video.
He had terrible audio in that whether or not he had tiles.
Like he did. Fucks up things all the time.
And I think he's just like, hey, not my fault.
This is the thing that happened that ruined it.
And it's like, maybe it's you. I don't know.
It's the lack of acoustic piles.
Is he sure it's not because his mic is like fucking three miles away from his face?
Well, this is the thing.
I think there are there are things he could do
in order to circumvent these issues, and I don't think he chooses to do them
because that would require
things called time and another things called effort.
But that's fine.
I'm sure we can still hear him, and that's the important thing.
Oh, I know this looks like the exact same room, but I swear it's a different one.
So I saw the rise of Skywalker and it was really bad.
And you'd think I'd be mad, but I'm really glad
in actuality, in actuality, in actuality, in actuality.
It's such a moment of like, if I was I don't know if I was helping script
to be like, when you want to just say actually, instead of I don't know.
Let's look at this fucking unit.
Oh, look at his glasses.
Can I just point out he has the sex doll at the back?
Do you know the law?
Oh, my God. Is that the sex doll?
Yes, it is. Yeah.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Is that after he fucked it in the face is why it looks so.
I think you know, this fucking thing on the regular.
Oh, no, please.
He's like, guys, I got a sex doll.
It's a joke about the joke about it.
They're even wearing the same type of shirt like
they're like, Oh, my God.
What is that though?
They have no, they're played.
It's like something.
Glad. Yeah. Oh, my God.
Well, two of those.
At least it's not like a low up doll, but actually it looks like decent quality.
It looks like you might have to spend at least like two hundred dollars
on a model like that.
Not that I would know.
Wow. No, no, that's been more.
How did you know that?
No, I just I just I look on the pictures on the Internet a lot.
I'm just saying that are nicer than others.
I'm just saying that these ads tailored to my search history
just keep showing to me and I don't get it.
I don't know how they got their officer.
I must be my my girlfriend.
Yeah, she's my computer.
It looks them up all the time.
The sad thing is he spent he spent a grand on that thing.
Is an eFap wiki, apparently.
If you go to diabetes entry, it currently says also known as Bob Chickman
or movie, Bob is the evil mastermind of the series pulling the strings all along
or the sugar behind the scenes.
It's already up to diabetes.com.
It's just a visual entry.
Oh, my God. Also, what did you what was a weekend?
You said like shut the fuck up.
But in your alien language, what was it?
Yeah, yeah. That's cool.
I like it. Yeah.
Sounds like sounds like an anime thing.
Oh, my God.
Anyway, let's let's listen to the Internet sensation.
Yeah, in actuality, we will listen to him.
Yeah, yeah.
Not much of anything.
The first scene in this movie is Kylo Ren tracking down Palpatine
and he meets him and Palpatine's like a zombie
and he's been put back together with like robot bits.
Well, I guess he's a professional YouTube reviewer.
For a second, I was thinking like he's like a cyborg.
I guess. Yeah, I have a cyborg.
Why does he sound bored?
Because he doesn't want to make videos anymore.
I remember someone like me, a video of his where he explains
how he's permanently downgrading his quality because he just can't be fucked.
Like, oh, man, he would used to do like full editing.
But now he's in a position of being like, look, I'm just going to vlog.
That's what that's what's happening now.
It's like, oh, good guys.
I mean, Jane Nicholson gets along just fine.
Jebby Nicholson. I mean, Jebby Nichols, right?
That's so sorry.
But I guess he wants to reach those those degrees of quality.
I suppose it's not bad.
Yeah, she films her videos in a supernova.
I can only explain how over exposed her videos are.
No, that if you say that that means you hate women.
Stop it. Maybe I do.
She makes me want to hate him so bad.
That's that's your internalized misogyny talking, Miss Longbone.
It is, it is.
And he says to Kylo Ren, you and I shall work together.
You will be my new daughter.
Well, it sounds like the controversy.
It's like a medieval mob boss.
It's like wants to do a voice, but he just can't be fucked to put in the effort.
My voice doesn't go that low.
You and I will go in the universe.
Yes, that was the one thing about Palpatine to this movie.
He, you know, he he came back all cylinder fire and he sounded like
like he wanted to fuck up the stars universe.
And he was going to unfortunately, Quinton can't do the Emperor voice.
That's fine.
Oh, our impressions were always like, what the fuck's happening?
Oh, yeah, we all have a limit.
Kylo Ren pay the price for your lack of visual no buy.
We're going to do episode six again, except this time it's got to be bigger.
And immediately that represented to me everything that I didn't want Star Wars to be.
All right. Well, yeah, it sounds like it's a big expectations.
Yeah, why didn't you like it?
It's the prettier expectations.
That's the best fucking thing in the universe.
I mean, it just like, you know, it's so easy to just flip the arguments.
We can do this all year.
Her eggs is going to be great.
2020 will just be the year of.
Well, maybe you hate Asian people.
And I think about that.
I they must hate women.
They must hate Asians or they must hate something.
Jevi unironically put out a tweet saying that, like, if a guy says
that he thinks Rose Tico is like a worthless character, it's going to be a race thing.
Like what?
Why?
I didn't see that because I got blocked.
Thankfully, I was blocked.
Yeah, she didn't like Rose Tico.
He's clearly a race thing.
And then the comments were quick to point out.
Ah, but it could be a woman thing.
Very true.
So what if we just don't like fucking fit galaxy brains over there?
Not possible.
It represented everything the sequel trilogy needed to avoid becoming
in order to be worthwhile and stand alone.
And Tommy just didn't.
OK, I mean, Star Wars wasn't already being like
it was going to be a spectacle.
No, I'm sorry. Sorry.
Not episode four. Episode seven was totally that is complete rip.
I guess TLJ was like half a rip.
And then Rise of Skywalker is only really a ripoff at the end
where it's like Palpatine trying to convert someone to the dark side
but also showing all of their friends die through a big window.
That's like hooray.
Yeah, you know, I guess he's right that they copied some stuff. Sure.
In order to be worthwhile and stand alone.
And it just didn't feel like a scene from a real Star Wars movie.
But the thing is that this ended up being the perfect tone setter for the film
because it told me everything I needed to know about what this film
was going to try and be and how unsuccessful it was going to be
and actually becoming that it is set out to be what it shouldn't be.
And it was unsuccessful being what it shouldn't have been.
So it was what it should happen.
I tell you, it's like JJ fucked up into making a masterpiece.
It was it was going to be terrible, but he fucked that up.
You're like, wait, all right.
It turned out amazing.
More, more.
So instead of continuing to care during that opening scene,
I did what Yoda suggested in episode three and episodes five.
I allowed myself to become detached from my investment
and thus I didn't feel anger.
I didn't feel any dark emotions.
I just sat back in my chair and I laughed.
I laughed a lot.
Not at the price of this guy.
Solidarity. We love to.
When when Ray blew up Chewy, for example, that was
I was like, oh, my God, they did it.
What else? What else are the big laugh moments?
Probably when she said, like, thank God C3P is still OK.
Babu Frick reentering the film that had me going.
I was like, hey, Babu, thank God.
They made sure to show us that he was on that little starship on the dashboard.
For me, it had to be Ray with the shark teeth.
Oh, yeah, that's great.
It was dark, a Bilbo moment.
Scary Bilbo.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Bill
it got no past.
I've had a lot of people say that when when Ben died or when they kissed,
a lot of people theaters were laughing.
It's so the 86 percent.
You know, if you know if JJ was in the cinema with me and I laughed at Babu Frick
coming back and he asked me, he was like, yeah, a successful comedic moment.
I'd be like, no, no, no.
They'd be like, what?
I'd be like, you got these two characters from a planet
that they spent apparently their lives on and they couldn't escape.
And you blew it all up.
You killed everyone they've ever known.
And then they just in the ship and like, hey, we're back.
It's unreal.
You have this little alien going.
I couldn't believe it.
I was like, wow.
Like, damn it, the one time I really needed to escape.
I couldn't do it.
I'm going to blow this up.
It's so odd because it's like she survived,
but the audience will be concerned that the funny alien survives.
We'll put him in there.
What about the entire crew that she mentioned?
Are they all dead?
Oh, my God.
Remember how she said, like, children are taken from that planet?
Well, yeah, they're not taken from it anymore.
Yeah, you don't have to worry about any of that.
Well, they'll never steal your children ever again.
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't what was like Yesen's formula.
It's like you need to free a slave for every person you kill.
And you're right.
I don't know what his mathematical equation for goodness was.
I don't think he ever wanted to really pin that one down.
We will say a blank much.
We will get a science on it.
It'll happen to laugh at.
Just in general, I didn't laugh all the time.
I held it back a little to respect the other people in the theater.
But pretty much the moment that the movie ended, I was like, I really wanted to laugh
more, but my theater was dead.
And I was like, oh, man, I don't want to be that guy
because I know that people will be like, can you please stop?
And I'll be like, no, it's like, no, but we expect it.
You don't want to be you don't want to be the De Niro and Cape Fear.
Yeah, good reference.
It was dark and they'll never see me again.
Fuck it. That's true.
What if they were like, I recognize your voice and you're like, oh, fuck.
You leave.
I tell them I'm quitting reviews.
It's me.
I couldn't hold it in.
I just stood up, ran out of the theater and I started laughing.
And I like walked out of the parking lot in the freezing cold.
I walked for like a few pictures running out of the theater.
On his own and just laughing.
And I can't imagine all of that happens.
And also, I don't believe it.
Ex to doubt.
I just I mean, if it did, though, I could just picture people
in like the sort of I don't know, just just the rooms or the parking lot outside.
Just look at him like, what are you doing?
He's like, oh, it's so funny, though.
So funny, though.
You just would get it.
He probably just like chuckled a little bit.
And then he's like, I'm really going to hand this up in my review.
That spoiled jar of sauerkraut is really enjoying himself, right?
Sack of potatoes.
Mile laughing the whole time, people walking by
must have thought I must have thought I was a madman.
And I don't know what I was laughing at.
Was I laughing at how bad the movie was?
Oh, I needed an edit.
They were like, we're just like zoomed in on a black and white.
He's like, I was experiencing something, laughing at something.
But I didn't know what amnesia is this enjoyment?
What was happening to me?
Had to find out.
That's a fucking breakdown, existential crisis.
Soundtrack kicks in, shows like loads of locations.
And he's like, I had to go to the source that.
What did I do that day?
What did you eat?
He's only one man who can help me.
My father, the door opens up this diabetes.
My son, you have returned.
I'm getting deeper.
You have returned. You're finally back.
Good picture, though, by the end of the trailer, it's like epic,
choir music and diabetes rising up with things floating around.
The rise of diabetes.
This is the movie.
And I would pay good money.
I would fucking.
Yeah, I would actually pay.
That's like kickass your levels of entertainment.
He's levitating two liter bottles of Sunkist.
A little bit, was I laughing at sort of the cultural phenomenon
which had evolved out of these movies, which turned out to be a total letdown?
A lot, yeah.
But maybe I was also laughing at myself.
No.
Or a version of myself that I could imagine who was invested in this film.
Or maybe, just maybe, I actually secretly still cared
a whole lot and laughing was just my coping mechanism.
When I got out of the theater, I tweeted out something like that was so bad.
I can't fucking believe it.
I walked out of the theater laughing and people didn't know if I was talking
about Star Wars or Cats, which how do cats is a masterpiece?
Cats, wonderful.
I haven't seen it yet, but I'm sure it is.
I haven't either. I've heard only good things.
Anybody here seen it?
I've heard a lot of jokes.
Me and my mom tried to watch it, and she wanted me to turn the fuck off after.
There you go.
All right, then.
That's the review, guys.
Yay. Thanks. Thanks for watching.
Which I think is a funny parallel.
And when I responded that I was talking about Star Wars,
someone asked me, is this the worst Star Wars movie?
Is it worse than The Phantom Menace?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not even the bomb.
You've got to go further.
You've got to go all the way to The Last Jedi.
I'm sorry. That's the last Jedi.
Oh, oh, oh, there you go.
I thought most people picked Attack of the Clones as the worst instead of Phantom Menace.
I guess I guess I'm wrong on that.
I don't know.
What are people? How does the world feel on that?
Does anyone remember?
With The Last Jedi?
No, like what do people typically think is with The Phantom Menace or Attack of Clones?
I can't remember Attack of the Clones.
I think people say his words.
You sure? Hmm.
Cats is unironically better.
I would be surprised.
We're going to check that out for you, fat movies, eventually.
Yeah, well, we'll take a look.
We will. I think.
I'm eager to see how just how terrible Cats is.
I think it's going to be an experience.
You can't get through.
We just abandon like we can't.
This is not enough material of us reacting because we're all stunned, silent,
like staring at the screen like, oh, God, I'm sure Cats are more entertainment value.
Yes.
The response is it's not the worst Star Wars movie,
but only because the prequels are so badly made that they're unwatchable.
But it's not really.
I mean,
at least you knew at least with the prequels, you knew George Lucas wanted to make those.
Like he had his passion put into those.
But this but these new ones are just like, oh, look, let's
look, let's just make this shit.
We need we need money, money, green.
It's hard.
You shouldn't necessarily be at this point.
But like what I would say is like, well, prequels made a lot more sense.
And I understood the stakes clearer.
And I could actually be like, oh, my goodness, I can understand the
both positive outcome and negative outcome of these scenes.
While with these films, it's like force healing.
You're like, oh, my, that kind of fucks with everything.
It's like hyperspace skipping.
You're like, oh, my, that fucks with everything, too.
And you're like, you know what else?
Emperor's alive.
You're like, oh, you need to stop.
You need to pull it right back.
Um. And he said all three of them, prequels,
like I actually think Revenge of the Sith isn't isn't all that bad.
This is a watchable movie for sure.
But unfortunately, I guess he's thinking more about Phantom Menace,
which can be boring.
It's still better than Last Jedi.
It's the most intellectually vapid Star Wars movie,
because when you look at the intentions and the themes of the prequels,
and they're actually really good.
And when you ask, why did more Star Wars have to be made at this point in time?
The answer again is a good one.
The answer is that George Lucas hated war
and he wanted to make a Star Wars film trilogy about how war is bad and how it's.
Oh, oh, is that what it is?
That's what war is, guys.
War is the way we realize Germany.
This is also this is what he said, true.
Well, the idea that George Lucas is trying to talk about war being bad,
I think it's a little bit more complicated than war is bad.
Like you will engage in a war if it means saving your civilization, surely.
No, you just want to realize your aggressors and you got to appreciate the logic.
It's like George Lucas said war is bad and then war is bad
because it's a tool of imperialism.
It's like, where did you get that?
Like, how did you derive that shit?
Like the George Lucas eight in an interview or something?
Maybe that's his commentary.
I didn't actually hear that, but let me explain it to you.
Yeah, I think the answer is that George Lucas hated war
and he wanted to make a Star Wars film trilogy about how war is bad.
It looks like how it's a tool of imperialism.
Yeah. OK, yeah.
So I've not seen any interviews or talks about that,
but I could maybe I've missed them.
But isn't the OT like peace is good or bad?
Well, yeah, yeah, OK, I don't think any of the films
are saying that like, hey, well, if anything, the Clone Wars made
a lot of people go, yeah, this is fucking awesome.
War is epic.
Clones and space battles.
Give me some of that war.
I want to go to war now.
Then they made like series about the Clone Wars and they made series about rebels.
Well, this is a tool of imperialism and bad.
OK, where else? Where are we going with this?
You know, the sequel films have always suffered from this big problem
where they don't have that same element.
They were created by Disney out of a corporate need for a franchise.
They were invented by filmmakers out of nostalgia
and they created I don't know if they were created.
I think they're just made for fucking money.
He's why they bought it.
That's kind of like money, right?
Yeah, nostalgia is just the way to get the money.
Yeah, yeah.
It's not they're they're driving.
Yeah, they didn't give a fuck.
Disney doesn't give a shit.
I seriously doubt that when JJ was making episodes
died, particularly, it was like, man, I can't wait to go back to Star Wars.
My favorite thing of all time and celebrate with all the fans like,
let's just get this done.
Didn't you have that interview?
He was just like, oh, fuck it.
I love that attitude.
It explains the whole movie.
That guy's that reinvigorated the love of Star Wars
and almost every generation.
But when they got to the end of the day
and they had to answer why they had done all of this,
they couldn't come up with a good answer outside of Star Wars is good.
And you should feel good liking it.
Oh, they want money.
Oh, fucking potato.
I mean, OK, I just at this point, I want to point out that
the new Star Wars shit doesn't want to say anything
because it's not really planned.
I guess there's no like he's saying that the new films are saying
that Star Wars as a franchise is a good thing and you should consume.
Is that his point?
I think so. Yeah, because I don't even agree with that.
The Last Jedi was like, fuck Star Wars.
OK, all right.
I mean, we had taste, but OK.
Do you think that Disney spent four billion dollars on Star Wars
to make people feel good?
I mean, it's clear that Quentin doesn't have a concept of money.
I mean, he bought a fucking thousand dollar sex doll for nothing.
Did he buy it or did he get it for free?
That's like because I remember reading tweets about like was the off of it.
Also, it was a discount.
I can't remember.
It was like a Kickstarter.
No, he was he was he was raising money for it.
Oh, my. Yeah, his fans paid for a thousand dollar sex.
That's how you know you've made it.
Excuse me, a thousand two hundred.
Oh, so thank you, Chase, for your encyclopedic knowledge.
There's varying levels of quality.
OK. And by the way, it's worth it. OK.
I believe you suck.
It was nine thousand.
Don't knock it till you try it.
I want to start off this in depth discussion
by analyzing the final scene in this film, which thanks to the nature of the sequels.
Is now the final scene in the entire chronological Star Wars saga.
Obviously, at this point, we're going to get into spoilers.
Let's do it. You somehow miss the kazoo bit at the beginning.
This is a good time to turn the video off all of Star Wars.
Oh, you mean that 20 second fucking bullshit
that you wasn't what it's through?
I guess. Yeah, no one.
No one missed that.
Why would nobody miss that?
Like, I don't know.
It just strikes me as all the people would want to watch a 30 minute analysis
that was of Riza Skywalker without realizing there's going to be spoilers.
I guess. Can you make a 30 minute discussion spoiler free?
I'll be difficult.
I'll bet if app can do it because they don't know when to stop talking.
We don't know how to edit or write or talk with the worthless fuckers killed.
Kill the guy down in front of their webcam for 10.
Are you just turning more Jewish gradually?
Wow, that that is a racism.
That was clearly like a Long Island accent.
Fuck you. No.
They're bad, they're long.
You're you're a bad man.
D Ray arrive on a planet which we immediately recognize to be Tatooine.
And then she goes to a place which we as an audience know is the Skywalker family farm.
And as an audience, we go, oh, my God, this is the place from episode four.
We're here again. Why are we here again?
And the movie goes, isn't it crazy that we're here again?
Isn't that so cool?
And we go, yeah, it is.
But why did you bring us here?
What's your fucking point?
Oh, my God, he's upset.
You're a toxic, fat, mad baby.
Yeah, you're just yeah.
It's a movie about space wizards meant for children.
Why are you criticizing it in any way?
I think there was a deleted scene where Ray was just hanging out with the two lightsabers.
She was like, where should I put these?
And Luke was like, I put them in my house, I guess.
Where is it?
He's like, oh, Tatooine, these are the specific coordinates.
And here's a photo of my house.
And then she went there and she buried them.
And he was like, thanks, bro.
Thanks. I really appreciate you doing that for me.
I don't really know why I wanted that, but I did. OK.
I don't even know who I am anymore.
Honestly, you just have no fucking clue looks around.
He's like, the fuck?
Let's go. How did I get here?
He's yeah, he's very upset.
Quinton, I think you need to calm down, though.
You're being very toxic.
That's just my opinion, I guess.
But, you know, yeah, he's talking about a scene.
With a female protagonist, he's getting this angry.
I mean, I'm just putting two together.
I'm not saying anything.
Two and two makes four.
Just saying.
And the movie goes, isn't it just cool that we can't be here,
that we can come back here and we go, yeah, we'll be here.
We did here before.
Why'd you fucking take us here again?
Um, that joke was really worth it.
I was like, well, this is so embarrassing.
To be fair, instead of just continuing on,
we're on a black screen now, so I'm wondering what will happen
when we return to you.
What are we even?
Is this like a new form of Quinton?
Like, rather, Quinton evolved as a critic.
I think so. He got so mad.
I thought he didn't care about this film.
Oh, wait, he said that he didn't care.
He said he might be laughing at a part of him that still does care.
He's tapping into that.
There you go.
Oh, my God.
He's maybe I care a little bit more than I was there.
You go. And you know what?
If that's what you want at the Star Wars movie,
just for the main character to go back to a set that you recognize
from a previous movie and to not really find a point in being there
outside of the presumption that you, the audience,
recognize the set and find some attachment to it.
Then you're going to love this movie.
Can we pause and say that I don't think that,
like, how could I put this?
I think the nostalgia was incidental.
Does that make sense?
Like, I get why Ray was there.
Like, does that make sense?
Like, I realized that he was right there.
To bury him to like, yeah.
But like, but why why why go there?
Honestly, I'm stuck all the way back at two.
Those things are very rare at this point.
Don't bury those.
Like, keep them there.
Really, really lethal weapons.
I don't know. It's more like how did you know that Tatooine?
I like probably because Luke Skywalker, she was in Tatooine.
I don't know. Like it is weird from Luke must have told
you to bury the lightsaber as a favor to him.
I like like, yeah.
Go back to the place where I was broken miserable.
It was even better.
Is he buries both the lightsabers that layer is like,
can you get older? Oh, fuck. Well,
we're all into the sky. Fuck it.
You know, this like hud down a piece of Alderaan is floating through this piece.
Even though we saw, yeah, because even though we saw Alderaan
basically get vaporized, we saw the same thing happen to the Death Star.
And that's true.
True. She's she's served that piece of the dish down to that planet.
Everyone knows it.
He surfed it like a boss.
That's really the limits test.
That that is in the Star Wars movie for you.
You can turn the video off now.
All right. He's talking about Eric Butz.
That's the guy who would have loved seeing.
I could honestly, and I'm not even like taking a shot here.
I think that when it showed the Tatooine, Eric Butz and the cinema wouldn't go.
I remember this location.
We'd be like, it's OK, dude.
Calm down. You're right.
Like, all right.
Wait, but they're like, did he like Rise of Skywalker?
This is, you know, I'm sure it's not possible for him to not love stuff.
Yeah, he loves like everything.
Star Wars. OK, so let me see.
Does he have a review?
Let me take a look like.
So Star Wars, the Rise of Skywalker spoilers geek out review.
Daisy Ridley movie 2019.
Daisy Ridley movie.
We're curious how her career will go post Star Wars.
I wonder if she'll end up.
Nowhere. He's crying.
And the thumbnail of his no spoilers geek out review.
He's crying. Oh, well.
Quentin's talking directly to Eric Butz. I knew it.
OK, they have a point in going back here.
It's a little deceptive to say that they don't have a point,
but it's such a vacuous point that it would almost be better to just pretend
that they didn't have a point.
An old woman walks up to Ray and asks for her name.
And she struggles with this as she has throughout the movie
because she doesn't want to call herself Ray Palpatine.
So thanks to the black and white woman
that she has no connection or relevance to as a character.
And she decides she's going to choose it as her new home.
And she says, my name is Ray Skywalker.
Is she going to live there?
I don't think she said anything about settling down.
Yeah, she just I the best thing that I could say
in terms of like an interpretation is that she just thought
it would be sentimental to bury the lightsabers there.
Yeah, yeah, probably.
I mean, I'm honestly so I guess Ray is capable of feelings.
Maybe Luke wanted to have his lightsaber in his house.
Like she said, she's going to keep it.
And he was like, fuck no.
You can have my name, but not my lightsaber, which at that point,
you're just like, OK, weird Luke.
But he's not, you know, really been acting normal for a while.
As for like she just walks off into the sunset.
I think the implication is she'll be like, this is a dirt hole.
I'm going to leave. Go to a better place.
It was a dirt hole.
I like I preferred my old dirt hole.
It was like a dirt hole, but above ground.
I think, well, she's probably going to she'll downright steal from people.
I think she, you know, she's a scavenger.
Yeah, that was a weird part of the film.
Do you remember when they were like, oh, you were a spice runner,
like an illegal thing?
And then Poe was like, you were a stormtrooper.
And then she goes, you were a spy.
And he goes, you were a scavenger.
And it's like, hang on.
I wasn't the same like.
Yeah, like you scavenged parts for a living.
And he's like, all right.
I ran drugs.
He like, that's a little different.
It's just all right, scavenger.
All right. Get off my case, scavenger.
And then the credits roll.
Oh, wait. So I do agree with what he said.
Like Ray has like a little connection with Skywalker with the Skywalker name.
I do think that the movie has failed to convince me that she has earned the name.
I still think it'd be cool if her to take the name Palpatine
to start doing good things in his name.
Yeah, I think that's a good that's a good point.
Yeah. She's like, you know what?
This is my family.
And I'm going to take and I'm going to work to make people, you know, turn that around.
Yeah, like I guess this is a little bit situation.
She's like, I'm Ray Palpatine, like a ball.
And they're like, oh, she's like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, that's our word.
Pee would.
Wait, this is Ray saying at the end of her journey, Luke was good.
I consider myself to be like Luke, and thus I am good by proxy.
I have two hot takes to say about this.
One is pretty normal and one is going to piss off.
What's a chud? So what is a chud?
Let me go. I know what it is.
I know what it is. It's a cannibalistic humanoid underground dweller.
I think that's what it stands for.
All right. A chud is an insult frequently used by leftists
to deride the members of the alt right or other right wing groups.
OK. Oh, all right.
So the second take he's got is going to be specifically against the alt right.
All right. You make sure you own the alt right in your Star Wars.
Those chuds, those chuds.
Get them. I guess he thinks that we're chuds.
Wait. Yeah, probably.
Even though a third of our lineup today is shades of not white.
That's racist.
He's saying he's upset about that.
And he is just like a black hole with eyes.
They call that chases and we've.
Well, he's still a dirty white man.
I know.
I believe it is like fucking.
Excuse me.
Is this how you justify your existence to us?
You're not even also doing knock chud life.
Have you even tried eating human?
I don't think so.
Chud life. Yeah.
My justification, my justification is that I played mystical ninja
starring Goemon on the N64 when I was like seven years old
and it just changed my entire world view.
I don't know about five or six of those words.
You say that we can you like translate that into like normal piss and stuff?
Yeah.
Japan, samurai, the sushi.
I get Japan, samurai, sushi, sushi, happy.
I follow. It was all downhill from there.
You find a new little dumpling monsters and it damaged me.
Let's move on.
I don't want to talk about it.
I can't wait for his chud hot take anti chud.
We'll start with that one.
And it's just got to be between me and you.
So come here, come here for a second.
Not too close, please.
Having a female lead to find her importance exclusively through a male lead
beach wasn't written well from jump, motherfucker.
All right, so it's telling you why herself.
And I'm sorry.
This like Skywalker isn't just Luke like Leia.
Yeah, I was going to say that's weird.
I thought I thought that's what I was trying to do with having both.
Yeah, both of them.
It's not like they did the Luke.
No, they did.
You see the cut scene where Luke pushed Leia aside like it's me.
It's a bitch. I'll tell you who you are.
Yeah. So like I'm just just in case anyone missed the right.
So he's saying it's it's bad writing for a female protagonist
to identify through all the achievements of a male name.
Is that kind of where he was going with that?
Maybe like, but that's just bad.
Always. That's not.
Why is he talking to the alt right about that?
I was going to say, I guess.
No, why is he talking about the alt right?
Honestly, no, I'm trying to.
So the alt right.
No, no, Rags.
He has to do first hot take the normal one.
I guess.
Isn't this the guy that just decided to like decry his disdain for Trump?
Yeah. Yeah, that.
Oh, yeah. This is the guy.
This is the guy.
I don't like Trump.
Just a fucking hate Trump.
I'm still on your side, guys.
I just I guess if let's just pretend for a second
that he's talking to someone who hates women, right?
Because that's what he thinks he's talking to.
So if someone if you hate a woman and you find out that she takes the name
of Luke Skywalker at the end of the film, wouldn't that annoy those people?
I don't know.
It's a fucking horseshoe theory at this point.
Yeah, I'm just confused.
Remember what I can't remember based on my politics,
what opinion I'm supposed to have on the Star Wars movie.
I need a horseshoe theory.
A horseshoe theory is like when something is so left, it like loops back around.
It becomes right.
Like, oh, the whole like free the nipple movement.
It eventually worked its way back around to like,
I don't want to see any naked women.
You're objectifying and keep those sluts clothed.
It's effectively how it comes off now.
Um, I'm going to play it again because I've lost myself.
Yeah, let's review.
Oh, we have to get close again.
Having a female lead to find her importance exclusively through a male
lead is bad writing.
Define her importance.
That's interesting.
I don't know if that was happening with her.
Exclusively find her importance.
She's I mean, you know, I'll hand it to her.
She's insanely good by herself.
I was going to say I'll hand it to her.
She saved the universe.
She did that.
I mean, it may not have made sense, but she did it.
Right.
She's amazing.
Yeah, she's a lot.
A lot of importance has been put on this character,
even though she's on possibly jack shit.
The most fucking earnest ever that yeah, like I'm sorry.
Quinton Skywalker isn't just good old Luke.
It's actually a complicated name because you got Luke,
Leia and Anakin attached to that one.
Um, and shimmy Skywalker.
She was a legend.
Let's not forget me.
No, by the way, wasn't me the name of the, um,
wasn't it the name of the first mate in Peter Pan?
Oh, hooks first mate.
Yeah, it was me SMEE rather than S HMI.
I think it's me.
I don't know.
Maybe chat was a question.
I'm sure.
Um, yeah, I don't know.
I guess we need to talk to some Chuds.
We'll get some Chuds on and they can tell us, uh, how angry.
It's remarkable.
Republican Chuddy.
Is he like that?
Imagine he's like unironically like I have a chud.
Yes.
I'm a chud.
Yes.
I think chud is.
I feel like Chuds have been misaligned, maligned, maligned, not misaligned.
Ignore that maligned unfairly.
Again, just, just to refocus.
I just defined her importance by attaching her surname to a family that already exists
that have done some of the worst war crimes while also saving the world while also being
a respected general of a resistance.
Like you've got a lot of stuff that comes with a Skywalker name.
Just saying.
Can we, can we like get some fan art of what Chud Skywalker would look like?
I want that more than I've ever wanted anything in my life.
I'm just picturing like a lumbering creature.
It's like caveman Ray.
Like an amorphous blob.
The only trained white males is Jedi.
Chud Skywalker.
Okay.
The second thing I have to say is that in a meta way, this moment is also the sequels defining
their own worth by saying the original trilogy was good.
I consider myself to be like the original trilogy and thus I am good by proxy.
This is your mind on themes, by the way.
Yes.
You start drawing out these crazy things.
Like this is the film saying that the OT is good and I am like it.
You're like, I don't.
It's like massive projection at this point, honestly.
Yes.
So Ray took the name because she had a lot of respect for Luke and Leia.
It made enough sense.
I just don't know.
But like, yeah, that's that is met narrative wise.
That is the sequel trilogy saying it is it is good.
Like the OT who is like, oh, yeah, well, you know, interpretations guys.
Okay.
I want to talk about the biggest problems that I have with Star Wars as a franchise,
which I sort of expected the sequel trilogy to fix.
The first thing is big.
There is one trilogy that people really like, the original trilogy, and all other
Star Wars media exists to mirror and reflect that piece of content.
The franchise is totally redundant to mirror and reflect.
Yes, it's really important that I get that across because
I'm in YouTube on a sewer and I can't stand two words being synonymous,
being used as separate points.
Okay.
Mirror and reflect.
It mirrors it and it reflects it.
No, maybe it like reflects it in the.
I don't know, like a mirror is like the clearest of reflections.
It's like a no use sort of thing.
He's right, though, that most Star Wars media tries to sort of be like,
hey, the OT was cool.
But then again, you know, a lot of prequel media came out after the prequels did,
even though people were 50 50 on it, like trying to be like the prequels.
Complicated to say the least.
But go on, Quentin.
exists to mirror and reflect that piece of content.
The franchise is total.
I could have cropped that image.
Come on.
He's put an image on the screen.
Could you at least appreciate that?
That's a lot of work to find an image you want and drag it onto your timeline.
These three movies are good.
Let's tie into them.
And that kind of ends up feeling limiting after a while.
The second issue is that as the franchise has expanded and more elements have been added onto
certain moments from the original trilogy have been altered or ruined.
For instance, in the original trilogy, Darth Vader is a terrifying evil force,
but we never understand the scope of how true this is.
We see him be imposing.
He throws some people around.
He kills some Nazi generals.
He fights Luke.
He kills Obi-Wan, kills, transitioning him into immortality.
But it's still drawn back enough that when he defeats the Emperor to save his son,
when he uses his final dying breaths to say that he loves the children he never knew,
we see him as redeemed.
But when the franchise circles back around and we truly see the scope of the crimes of Vader,
that redemption starts to feel like bullshit.
Uh, I have not heard that take before.
Uh, yeah, I, I've not heard that either.
If anything, it kind of makes the redemption more meaningful
because it shows how much he went back on.
Yeah, he was, he was essentially completely lost as a
Vader in terms of his, I don't know, moral compass.
But the thing is, you have to remember there's a lot of contextualization.
Like he saw the rebels as like, essentially terrorists that were fucking with the Empire
when the Empire is this peace.
What does he say in the prequels?
Peace, prosperity, and justice.
Like he sees, that's what he sees the Empire as.
Um, like just trying to dismantle or destroy the Death Star is something that he absolutely
considers to be, you know, that's a bad.
And so he will, he will happily slap people down with a, with a hot knife.
If he has to.
A 1000 degree knife.
Yes.
Where did they go, huh?
That was because that was a good time on YouTube.
That was because people realize most of the time it's like, oh,
I went through a thing for about half a second and then it cooled off.
We got to reheat it again.
And the same thing happened.
And there's the thing.
I don't think like he's a good guy.
Like, I don't, I don't think it, it, it becomes a sort of like, say, for example,
I think I talked to Rags before, but if, um, if he didn't die at the end of
return the Jedi, he got on a ship with Luke and then he went to Endor
and everyone was dancing because they defeated the Emperor and all that stuff.
And he's like, oh, hey guys, uh, I'm, I'm going to stay in the ship.
Like this awkward, not gonna, you guys have fun.
Cause it's just gonna be like, how the fuck would anyone want to deal with
him outside of Luke, uh, after everything he's done?
And that's the thing.
I think you're supposed to not consider him altruistic at that point.
You're just supposed to be like, Oh, he's actually made it a really important
decision. Um, sort of had a huge moment for his character, but he's not.
Then undone like totally he's not off the hook.
Those young legs are still dead.
Vader is the main perpetrator of one of the worst genocides to ever happen in the galaxy.
He murders children with his own hands.
He is implicit in several other genocides, also perpetrated by the empire,
including the Lissat and everyone killed on Alderaan and all the fucking species.
He wipes out all the toddlers.
He slices into with his laser sword.
We're supposed to believe they get to the afterlife and space.
Jesus is all like, don't worry guys.
In a couple of decades, he's going to throw an old guy over a railing and then
he's going to say that he loves the point here.
Quentin, I think you're really, really missing the point.
There's like a mechanical aspect to it.
It's not like that's, that's how he felt.
He was a Jedi.
So he's not a Sith like this.
No, like there's not like a space judge that goes, you are a Sith.
He, you know, maybe he could, if you can turn from a Jedi to a Sith or a Sith to a Jedi,
oh, you know, I imagine you can actually do it a couple of times throughout your life.
You can probably be like, you know what, I feel pissed today.
Nope, can't do it.
Can't go back.
No backsies.
So yeah, I don't, I don't think it works exactly like that.
Like the idea that he gets to be a force ghost or something is,
is something that a space Jesus gave him.
Also that it's like, no, it's not really how that works.
We, we know now that it's like a knowledge you have to have.
It's like I said, it's mechanical.
Um, but I could totally see Obi-Wan being like, oh, hey buddy.
And he's like, hey, yeah, I know.
I know.
Space Jesus is all like, don't worry guys, in a couple of decades,
he's going to throw an old guy over a railing and then he's going to say that he loves his
daughter and then he's going to come hang out here with all you guys.
It's a massive inconsistency that we.
Well, hang on.
The OT alone was enough to know that he was a horrible monster in terms of the things he
had done.
The idea that he killed all the younglings and stuff.
It's like, I mean, did you not think that when he was okay with like raising planets,
that children died?
Yeah, he blew up Alderaan.
He was fine with blowing up Alderaan.
Like everything else is just, he blew up a planet, man.
Yeah.
Like what?
You're not going to say, oh yeah.
And he killed some kids in a room once.
He's like, he's already blown up a planet.
I think we've exceeded.
We've established it.
Yeah.
Quinn is like, can you confirm there's a nursery on that planet?
You're like, there's like one, two, three.
He destroyed a planet of billions and six children.
Oh shit.
Now that you added those six children in at the end, what an asshole.
It changes everything.
We allow ourselves to buy into because we understand that the movies were not
written in order and probably should not be viewed that way.
But they made him a monster.
They always intended that he was a monster.
Yeah.
What did they contradict here?
What's the problem?
He's, he redeemed himself in that sense.
That doesn't mean that he's off the hook.
Yeah.
This is like, that's the thing, man.
If he was to come back into real happy life and he colors his suit white to look as horrifying
and you put draws a smile on it, it's like, you just be like, dude, you kind of still,
I don't know.
What are you, what are we thinking jail?
I don't know.
You need, you kind of, you did a lot of things.
I'm going to say that.
Okay.
And he's like, I'm sorry.
To be fair, chat makes a decent point.
Those younglings were orphans just click true.
So really that should take, instead of adding six, that should take six away from
the Alderaan count, which is still quite a few.
I'm guessing, but, and you know, they didn't even fight back.
Like it's kind of, they fall in a little way, isn't it?
Like they could have done something, you know, then they just let it happen.
Stupid kids.
I personally, I would have been like, nah, not having that.
I would have, would have thrown my lightsaber, tried something.
I think we should blame the kids is where I'm going with this.
Okay.
They, do you see how rude one of them were?
It's like, what are we supposed to do?
It's like, how is, how is Anakin supposed to tell the kids what to do all the time?
Like I'd be pissed.
I think it's fair.
He's a good guy.
The prequels recontextualized Vader to be a hero, I think of, of the orphan killing brand.
My point is simply that had Vader's wider story arc actually been
written in chronological order, it would have been bad writing.
Episode one, Vader personally murders children.
Episode two, Vader helps orchestrate several genocides.
Episode three, uh, Vader kills his boss and then says he.
But that's, that's the most simplified vision ever.
Yeah.
That's, that's, it's not just an old guy.
There are some old guy.
That's all he is.
Like Luke has to kind of work pretty hard to get him to come over to not being an asshole.
So that also doesn't.
And, and plus like Vader, Vader was super like, this was him completely going against
basically everything that he had.
He had complete and total investment in the empire and, and, you know, Palpatine.
Uh, it wasn't just him killing a guy.
It was him turning his back on all that.
And his, he probably knew that he was going to get effed up anyway.
So it's just such a weird, he's like, oh, I just threw an old guy down his mine shaft.
He's like, no, no, a little more than that, a little more than that.
Loves his daughter.
And now he's in good guy immortality forever.
See, I think that's a bit of a misconception.
Good guy immortality.
It's like, no, it's, it's mechanical.
You could learn how to do this, even if as far as I'm aware, you can do it as a Sith too.
Uh, like, if you had like a Jedi pal who was really annoying and he learned how to do it
and you see him in the afterlife, you're like, oh, well, hey buddy.
And in rice of Skywalker, it's powering Palpatine.
Isn't that kind of like, like, isn't like in rice of Skywalker, the Sith are like powering Palpatine.
Uh, like all of the Sith are in Palpatine and all of the Jedi are in Ray.
And that's a thing.
Yeah.
So that, that sort of implies that they could have some spirit shit.
Imagine all the Sith like being in Palpatine, giving him all their power
and he electrocutes himself and like, what are you doing?
Stop what?
No, stop, stop.
Why are you doing this?
But the other thing that the prequels do is rewrite the Jedi to not be fun.
And I mean in ways other than the video essay I released a few days ago discussed.
In the original trilogy, Luke has the Force because he's an audience surrogate
and the filmmaker wants you to believe that you can use the Force yourself.
No, um, um, it's a hero's journey.
Isn't that why he's, uh, what?
Because Luke is an audience surrogate.
I mean, he's, he's an insert for like the, the, the guy who's unaware of so much stuff
that he can ask questions that we will appreciate the answers to.
And he's a partial blank slate, but, um, if that's what he's kind of getting at, I guess.
We need to listen to it again.
Disgust.
In the original trilogy, Luke has the Force because he's an audience surrogate.
I don't know why would that be why he has the force.
I thought everyone could have the force now.
Or I thought that the force was at the time, it was not really defined as to who had it.
Anyone could have it.
I'm very confused.
Yeah.
This is an odd point.
Also, could you talk about the rise of Skywalker?
He's getting there.
God.
The filmmaker wants you to believe that you can use the force yourself.
It's this vague magic that exists all around us that anyone can be trained to understand and use.
It's an energy force.
Anakin can use the force because his blood is better than yours.
The force is gifted exclusively to those with superior genes.
I don't think that that's what it is.
I think it's just that it doesn't like everybody has a midichlorian count.
It's just some of more, some of less.
Yeah, I thought so.
Like there isn't an entity on because the force is everything, or at least it flows around
everything.
And so, theoretically, anybody can use it.
It's just that if you have more of a concentration of midichlorians, then you can use it more
better.
Yeah, I don't think we mentioned it twice.
Once Qui-Gon on Tatooine and then once in the Jedi Chamber.
Well.
It's been so long since I've seen them.
I think so.
Because then they're just like never brought up again after that.
Well, chat's lighten up.
What do we got?
Triggered by Qui-Gon, I guess.
Superior genes.
The force is closer to IQ.
Also, yeah, I don't know if you can call it superior genes when he was like created
by the force, as in like Palp's or Palp's Dash or whatever.
I don't know if the force would be like, I'm going to give your baby
fucking diabetes and it'll be crippled and it'll have osteoporosis.
You have to have over 7000 midichlorians to be a Jedi, apparently.
7000?
I guess that's in some kind of extended thing.
I don't know.
Maybe there's like a direct correlation between like midichlorians and chromosomes.
But as Aiden says, midichlorians, I like to think, are a thing that are just drawn towards the force.
So an indicator rather than the cause of it.
Okay, all right.
Which is certainly a better way than...
Oh, you have more midichlorians there for you.
If that's true, that doesn't help the prequels a lot in terms of the quote,
unquote damage because you could have multiple explanations.
It doesn't make you a Jedi, it just shows people that you're a Jedi.
Though you'd still have the issue of like, wow, there's a lot that's surrounding that
chancellor.
How are you doing there, buddy?
And he's like, yeah, I'm fine.
And you're like,
Definitely strange.
Suspicious eye, the hairy eyeball, if you will.
But okay, we'll see where he goes with this question mark.
You can use the force you have to be related to another famous person who can also use the force.
This whole bloodline thing was introduced exclusively for the reveal that Darth Vader
was Luke's father, but it's indirectly led to the mysticism of the force being absolutely
destroyed.
Oh, but not the last Jedi.
Well, you did say earlier that like, it is damaging it, right?
Like he said the sequels damage it too.
I guess he's saying the prequels damage it too.
Maybe it is partially to do with bloodlines as well.
Just just in terms of like,
overall power.
You've confused me with that midichlorian thing
just being an indicator.
It's like, interesting to think about in terms of they're drawn to an entity that has
better use of the force, I guess, or more powerful use.
But I don't think we ever gotta, is there any extended universe stuff that kind of clarifies
the midichlorian explanation?
Or do they just forget that even happened?
Because I'm unaware of it.
There's probably something on Wikipedia has got to be.
Let me let me look at midichlorians.
Well, Rags does that.
ER, if you're still there, can you say something so the chat knows that you're not dead?
I think a fucking tism right now.
Okay.
Midichlorians were intelligent microscopic life forms that lived symbiotically inside
the cells of all living things.
When present in sufficient numbers, they could allow their host to detect the pervasive
energy field known as the force.
So it's not a genetics.
So it looks like according to Wookie Pedia.
Yeah, it's like.
Paris, the force spoke through the midichlorians,
allowing certain beings to use the force if they were sensitive enough to its powers.
It says in order to gauge the individual's potential within the force,
blood tests were used to estimate the number of midichlorians within the subject cells.
So I guess it's like you're it's a built in cap for how good your force is, which is shit.
The thing is, like going just from the prequel movies,
it's really not that much information on exactly what the hell is even going on with that.
Um, but as far as I'm aware, in Star Wars, there is definitely like,
if you're a part of, say, the Skywalker bloodline, you're probably going to be more
force sensitive.
I mean, is there a genetic component to how many midichlorians you have body?
Perhaps.
Or well, that's the thing.
I'm getting all crossed lines in my head right now in terms of like,
where does it all begin?
Who does the what and the where and the why?
But yeah, as far as I knew, everybody can use it.
Some people just really shit with it.
Like, they suck.
Some people really fucking good with it.
And then midichlorians come into that with all living, like, yeah,
all living things have midichlorians, probably just to lesser and greater degrees, right?
That's that's the the canon as far as I'm aware.
There's going to be people who know this pretty well in chat, probably.
I guess I didn't think that this Rise of Skywalker review would be so focused on midichlorians.
Yeah, I know.
It feels like we've jumped into the equals.
But I guess he's trying to say this is an example of how the OT gets ruined by additional content.
Someone said someone said the ER is force ghost.
Force goes talk, though.
And they could I mean, they could really just do anything a normal person could do.
Yeah.
In fact, as more established and teleport being a force ghost is actually a lot better
than being alive. So let me ask something that really cares about your is personified
objectively good or kind of overrated.
I need to hear this from you.
Objectively good.
There you go.
Somebody sent me something insane.
I need you to take a look at it.
Oh, did I see that?
Oh, yeah, I saw that.
I've got that ready for.
Holy shit.
The chat just you wait.
We got it.
Can we show that on the street?
Oh, it's a man.
Yeah, I know.
That's true.
Yeah, it's a man's.
Can I just say the shading on Quentin's face in that image?
It's as terrible as it is in real life.
Amazing.
The way that Luke is sitting or lying again.
And he doesn't like uncomfortable like he's happy.
He's really making a bit of it.
Hmm.
Anyway, well back to talking about midichlorians in the prequels.
Yeah, not fun, not approachable.
And on an intellectual level, a little overtly.
Fashy on an intellectual.
Fashy.
It's a machine on an intellectual level.
Goddamn.
Wait, what is fashion?
Like fascistic.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think kind of what was fascist about for the
midichlorians are like, it's like a superior race.
But well, okay.
But like, which I mean, technically they are a superior.
I was going to say, like, what if normal people are plus the force?
Like if we have people who, but that happens now, like bodies that are just better equipped for
doing more or different things, you can't necessarily conclude that because someone
can use the force better, they are a better person or I mean, they're better equipped to
use the force by definition.
But is that, is that fascist?
The fact that someone might be like, hey, I would actually prefer to have the ability
to control things with my mind better.
It's like, so we should single out.
I mean, he was interested in just getting stronger and stronger and stronger.
Uh, it's, it's fashy.
It's fashy.
Let's give it another go just to hear that reveal that Darth Vader was Luke's father,
but it's indirectly led to the mysticism of the force being absolutely destroyed.
It makes the force not fun, not approachable.
And on an intellectual level, a little overtly
fashy, how does something be a little overtly, a little overtly, a little majorly.
It's, it's, it's somewhat obvious, you know, stick.
What is my whole stick?
Oh yeah, you're, you're a little bit, yeah, yeah, a little bit.
How do you even spell fashy like F A S H Y probably if we're going like F A C S H
Yeah.
All right.
That's that's the big question.
Also somebody, someone bloody simile brings up a good point in chat.
He says, wait, how does a force ghost use the force if they have no body or blood to have
midichlorians?
They're, they're goople steins that surround them.
They, they have the midichlorians.
What are goople steins?
I'm new.
I don't have to tell you about every pot of stalls.
Chase seriously.
Oh my God.
Can I just, can I rant for a second?
I, I fucking came from like a community of people that would like to review video games
and people like Quinton are kind of in Quinton.
If you're listening, you seem like a narcissist.
You probably listen to this stuff.
I'm sure you're a nice guy.
I'm sure if we had a drink, we'd agree on a lot of things and have some similar philosophies.
He wouldn't talk with you.
No, he wouldn't.
He probably already has me blocked just from being on here.
But there's so many people in like the game review community that have like this weird
sort of vocal fry and just like cut away really quickly to compensate for lack of proper comedic
timing.
And it's his and the full beard and like the goofy, like funny slogan t-shirt.
It's just, he's just like a walking caricature of like internet reviews.
I wasn't sure if we discussed that already.
Maybe I wasn't here for it, but it bothers me.
LGBTQ plus frogs fucking on his dresser there.
And I think they are like actually humping.
Greg's you were talking about that.
Yeah, he's he's an ally.
Let him do the fucking, you know, let him be.
Does he have pronouns in his bio on Twitter?
I need to know that.
I'm almost certain.
I would be able to check because I'm blocked.
Let me check if I'm not blocked.
Also, chat want me to ask to acknowledge Aiden Paladin.
Acknowledged.
He does.
He does have pronouns in his bio.
Just he slash they.
I don't think I've seen that combo before, but that's fine.
I'm not.
By the way, there's nothing wrong with pronouns in your bio.
It just speaks a lot to you.
He's a they, I guess.
Oh, God.
I don't have anything against transgender people.
I just think it's a cliche.
He is very cliche.
Also, if the forest is genetic, then you would think that the Jedi would encourage
strongly Jedi to have kids.
Interesting, yes.
As this is this is apparently from Discord, a common misconception held that
midichlorians were force carrying particles when in fact they more function as translators.
So the more of them you have, the more efficient you can understand the force.
Is that fair?
It's like the force is the ocean and your midichlorians are the amount of buckets you have.
All right.
Back me up on this.
We're all just like, sure.
No, you're on your own.
But does being from a particular bloodline increase the likelihood of midichlorians all
simply mean that you might end up being someone who is good at using the force?
I don't know.
You know, if you're a Skywalker, does that mean you get more midichlorians?
Well, there ain't none of them left.
Nope.
Well, what about Rey Skypatine?
Adopted doesn't count.
We know that.
Kind of makes a ring to it.
It's not even adopted.
Um, yeah.
All right.
Well, you know what?
Let's just, I'm hoping we get to rise a Skywalker at some point.
And on an intellectual level, a little overtly fashy.
The plot of episode one is the Jedi arrive on Tatooine.
They see all these slaves.
They see all this injustice.
They decide not to do anything about it ever.
But then they need a boy.
You like TLJ.
How can you say this criticism?
Yeah.
Yeah, guys.
It's way worse.
They have interest in freeing the animals.
They leave the humans.
While in the prequels, what you're dealing with is a system on the outer rim
as they establish that they can't and isn't it?
There's lots of talk about the even trying to free two slaves is extremely difficult.
And you've got a political system with the huts that will fuck you up.
If you try and like, you know, break this, you could start a war.
Sure. Send the Republic to go and invade Tatooine and free all the slaves.
The outer rim.
But the problem, I guess, with that is that like,
is the Republic going to go galaxy trotting and just kill everybody who doesn't not have slaves?
Yeah, it's one Jedi in his apprentice on a ship that's carrying the leader of a faraway planet
on route to like, this is not listen, this ain't the time and place.
It's out of their jurisdiction is the point.
And you might be like, shouldn't they have a moral responsibility?
It's like there's probably thousands of planets that they have a moral responsibility to potentially save.
I just don't know that it works like that.
It's just like the same as our planet, but on a galactic scale.
Because the slaves is in certain parts of our planet is still a thing, right?
Sadly, absolutely.
But why isn't why isn't Quentin saving those slaves rags?
Because that'd be imperialist.
Oh, my God.
Which is a bad living together for mutual advantage.
Without midichlorians, life could not exist.
And we would have no knowledge of the force.
They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the.
When you learn to quiet your mind, you'll hear them speaking to you.
I don't know what that means, really.
My forms living together without midichlorians life couldn't exist.
They tell us the will of the force.
It does get confusing exactly how old it works.
I don't think anybody's going to disagree with that.
Speaking of the prequels.
I wanted to ask, are you are you aware of Oney like Chris O'Neill at all?
Yes.
Have you ever seen Oney plays where they constantly just rag on George Lucas being obsessed with Jar Jar?
No, I don't think I see that, but.
They'll just be like he's in his sleep just turning over going Jar Jar.
Jar Jar kills Darth Vader.
I just I wanted to see Jar Jar the sequels.
I was he would have been I would that would have been my fanservice.
Having Jar Jar teared up in one of the ships being like.
He's not going to fuck you up.
He's super badass now.
I would unironically love that.
It would be so much fun to be like the whole side series.
It's like like they have that one Star Wars ride at Disney Land or Disney World.
And he was saying what would you do if George Lucas was just at the end of the ride like.
I need all of you to pose and say Jar Jar is the best Star Wars character.
Everyone look at the camera and say Jar Jar.
Jar Jar.
Yeah, exactly.
Like you can't get off the ride unless you say that Jar Jar is your favorite character.
Or else this ride will be your tomb.
Who they find out has superior genes and they decide they have to free him exclusively
and recruit him into their order of people with superior genes as well.
Which is so like Qui-Gon super interested in him because he thinks he's a part of a prophecy
that's going to bring balance to the force.
It's not just about Obi-Wan said his midi-chlorians were off the charts.
Yeah, this was an extremely special case and Qui-Gon does try and free more than one slave.
He's just unable to and he tries to do it through bartering rather than some.
He doesn't fight to free them because he can't.
Again, it'll start a war.
They're not allowed and fucking hell who knows what'll happen if you have the Republic going
outside of their borders.
This is the thing, the prequels did a lot of political shit that everyone apparently found
boring and now don't remember when criticizing it.
They had to go to the Outer Rim to escape the jurisdiction of the Trade Federation, right?
That's why they were like, we will go to the Outer Rim because nobody's going to find us there.
No, dude, just invade other planets and take people.
I'm just picturing like they tried to take her that her head explodes and they're like, fuck.
It's like, oh yeah, that's right.
This is a thing that they plan for.
We can't just take them.
Else maybe they would have left on their own.
If anyone in chat hears any errant giggling, Jay Longbone has made it a periodic event
for a bunch of pictures of Quentin out of context, like with the mirroring and making
these like these shit eating faces just randomly pop up in our group chat.
So if you hear any giggling, that's pretty much always what that is.
Definitely not a cult.
Do not call it a cult.
Slavery is okay on the planet of Tatooine, but we will save this boy who has the superior
head shape of the Jedi.
Oh my God, he's he's doing everything in his power to make the Jedi like Nazis.
I was just going to say, like, we've we've counted the algorithm like three times and
I was sort of just going to keep it going.
It's like, keep it up, Quentin.
Just keep saying it.
My final problem with Star Wars was introduced by the movie The Force Awakens,
which is a good film that still has this massive, massive franchise destroying element.
AJ Abrams believed that the main appeal of Star Wars was cool reveals like that Luke's
father is Darth Vader.
And so he wrote The Force Awakens, not only to be a good standalone movie,
but to also ask questions which would incentivize the audience to be invested in sequels,
answering said questions.
Who or Rey's parents?
Where did she get her superior force genetics from?
Genetics?
That's an interesting way to say that.
Genetics.
Where did Snoke come from?
How is he connected to other bad guys in the franchise?
Who are the Knights of Ren?
He took all these mysteries that he did not have answers to,
and he put them all in a box that he calls the mystery box.
And then he kind of went maybe in a sequel film,
someone will open the mystery box and you'll find out what's inside.
And Ryan didn't.
I was going to say, yeah, that's a fair take.
This is a take from 2017.
So not bad, Quentin.
Yeah, a lot of mystery boxes.
Ryan could have done stuff with that, and he didn't.
Well, see, that's the we have simultaneous narratives.
People say that he didn't answer those boxes,
but he also didn't have any help answering them.
So therefore, whose fault is it?
And I'm like, I still think it's more Ryan's fault.
Yeah, this is where you're a writer director.
This is what your job is.
Your job is to do these things.
Being like, who are the Knights of Ren?
It's like, you have so many options.
What was so hard about that?
That he was like, there's no time for them with the film.
He was like, oh, oh, OK.
All right.
Kill Harry and Chad said, where did you come from, Quentin?
That you got, I don't know, raise lineage.
Didn't correct me if I'm wrong.
The Force Awakens was kind of like, it doesn't matter.
And that you should just go hang out with Luke.
Maybe the maybe what he was inching towards
was that she was going to be Luke's kid.
I don't know.
We never know, especially with Rise of Skywalker.
I don't really know what the hell J.J.'s original plans were.
Maybe he always intended for her to be a Palpatine, but we'll never know.
But yeah, no fair enough take.
I suppose, Quentin.
I'm just curious how much he's going to teeter around The Last Jedi.
I'm pretty sure he liked that movie,
but there's a lot of blame to be placed around it.
Aiden said that does does Quentin not believe in chromosomes?
That can't be right.
Is that coming from the whole superior genetics thing?
Aiden said, what a shock.
Someone who doesn't believe chromosomes are real
is mad about the in any way hereditary.
Could you link me to that?
Because that's insane.
If he doesn't think that chromosomes are real.
Yeah, I'm trying to think of how that could be contextualized, like,
in a normal human way.
Is it that he?
No, I got nothing.
Yeah, well, I guess we'll see.
And again, the mystery box is not only a core defining aspect of why people like that movie,
but also why they wanted more Star Wars films after that.
But from my experience, the biggest question that most audience members walked away with
from The Force Awakens was sort of a slow burning one,
where they went, wow, that was incredible.
It was like episode four, but bigger.
Why was it like episode four, but bigger?
Why did it choose to be that?
Why did it accomplish?
Why are we not talking about Rise of Skywalker?
He's getting there.
You keep rushing him.
Okay, you keep rushing him.
And I'm getting tired.
I was enjoying this video and you're like, oh, talk about the title.
I was really hoping to get his take on the Rise of Skywalker.
He talked about the first scene and then we.
No, he talked about the final scene.
I think I think this is a classic argument approach known as gish galloping.
Oh, what do you mean?
Well, just like what he's doing.
Like he's just kind of covering as much fucking ground as possible before he actually.
Let's say I stood neutrally on Rise of Skywalker.
He hasn't convinced me of shit yet.
I think he's getting there, though.
The second half of the video will all be Rise of Skywalker calling it now.
Baby.
A few other Star Wars films have literally just chosen to be a different Star Wars film,
but with a larger scale.
What was the purpose of doing all that?
To get people to make money.
Is this entire sequel franchise just going to be the original trilogy, but on a bigger scale?
I think that's kind of what they're going for.
Yeah, because you don't shit on your built in audience
until The Last Jedi.
Good job, guys.
Oh, I just mean like it was very focused on money.
It was clearly super referential.
It was bringing back everybody's favorite characters and favorite locations and favorite
tools of the universe and just just stand down.
It's like, why would they do all of that?
It's like probably to make us go, oh, it's like, wait, you think they weren't focusing
on making like character driven stories?
You're like, what do you mean?
No, no.
And also, while it is bigger, it's also dumber for sure.
There you go.
I mean, oh, J.K.
Rowland said chromosomes exist and she's being cancelled right now for saying it.
She said that sex is real, essentially.
J.K.
Rowland said sex is real.
So yeah, I heard about that trans people.
Yup.
I guess.
Apparently.
Apparently what that means today.
Oh, I understand.
No, X, X, X, Y.
I understand.
So what you're saying is.
I thought we were talking about having an extra chromosome.
He didn't believe that, I guess.
Yeah, I don't know.
Gwen's probably got a few chromosomes there.
And full extra put on there.
A safe measure.
And what makes me love The Last Jedi is that all of these qualms and more are addressed within
the film, even if it's in a way that a lot of audience members did not appreciate.
One of Ryan Johnson's main points in the film is that the setup in The Force Awakens is kind
of silly because it gives out all these questions and all these mystery.
But none of these questions can really be answered in a way that will satisfy
the long hunger that the audience has had.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
Bullshit.
No, absolute bullshit.
Writer.
Hello.
That's your job.
So it's your job.
Does anybody think there's any explanation for Snoke's
backstory that could have been satisfying to general audiences?
Well, actually, let's put it this way.
General fans.
So like, not the general audiences.
General people who are like, I love Star Wars.
The Force, midichlorians.
I know it all.
Woohoo.
Is there any answer you could give Snoke that would be generally satisfying to those people?
I'd be like, yeah, probably.
Just check out any of their videos.
Like all the fan videos.
Check out the most popular fan videos and you'll have your answer.
Snoke with Mace Windu.
Snoke with Mace Windu.
Snoke with Mace Windu.
Snoke with Mace Windu.
Keep in mind, Ryan.
Keep in mind, Ryan Johnson basically already wrote off the fandom anyway.
You can, even before he even started working on the movie, he already made up their mind,
oh, they're just a bunch of bloodthirsty nerds and their desires will never be quenched.
It's impossible to make something satisfying.
They're like, okay.
Especially when they're nerdy man babies.
They're all right goods.
Entitled fucking cucks.
Yeah, I think that they could have satisfied people.
And, you know, I do find that I'm using this like, you have to hit this target that's pretty tough
and you got like a rifle with a scope and it's like, can you do it?
And Ryan Johnson just fucking threw the gun away.
He was like, nah, it's not possible.
It's like, you couldn't try.
Try it?
No?
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, he's giving him props for not doing his job, which is kind of.
Oh, yeah.
Darth Plagueis ever.
I remember that being the prevailing theory.
It was like, he's going to be Darth Plagueis.
And he looks like he does because he survived Palpatine's attempt at killing him.
That's what it was going to be, right?
That's like, I think that was like what everyone's money was on for what the most likely explanation
for him was going to be.
And I think that if they had done that, I'm not saying it would have made for a great story.
I'm going to say that I think most people would have been relatively satisfied for
that were Star Wars fanatics would have been interested beyond specific mechanics.
I think they would have been like, yep, that works.
So, yeah, I don't know.
And the idea that it's like, see, Ryan was trying to prove a point that these questions
just were never going to be answered in a satisfying way anyway.
So he just fucking gave up.
It's like, oh, good job.
There are no potential answers to any of these mystery box questions
that don't sound inherently stupid when you say that out loud.
How is nothing better?
I was nothing not stupid.
Yeah.
How have you determined that all of the potentials that could have ever been thought of
wouldn't have satisfied people generally?
Because that's bullshit.
Because the force awakens satisfied people generally.
Yeah, it did pretty well.
People were the happy faces.
So go watch some of those like stupid how it should have ended animations
that run through like all the different options they could do.
No, it didn't.
They choose some like, oh, my they also do it in a cartoony way.
Like, yeah, like they're like, lol, your Ben Kenobi's daughter.
She's like, whoa, I don't know what to say, Quentin.
If you're so stupid that you think that all of those cartoons discuss every possible potential
for how it could have explained.
I just I don't know what to say, man.
I don't know how dim you've got to be to believe that.
I think you well, I think is he actually taking a shot at he she there as well?
Like, because obviously they how it should have ended implying that he's like they're wrong.
Um, yeah, they I've seen their video.
It's just is I always saw it as a more of just like he has have some fun.
Hey, it turns out because they make it like they do the soap opera dramatic reveal stuff.
I'm pretty sure anyway.
God, a waste mace window is my uncle.
Imagine how out of left field it would have been if in the last Jedi during that big conclusion,
Kylo had given the answer to Ray that he gives an episode nine.
He would have been like, yeah, your grandfather's Palpatine.
And she would have been like, Oh, I guess, I guess that's not really relevant to me.
Yeah, well, she would be like that, because she wouldn't know who he is,
because she thinks all of it is a myth.
But yeah, it'd be pretty daunting to realize that you are the direct descendant
of what is essentially space Hitler.
So you'd be like, Oh, fuck.
Some some people can do improv comedy.
Well, Quinton is not one of them cannot do it.
He can't do it.
Quinton, stop stop doing gradual incremental zooms on your face to indicate
to the audience that this is a joke now.
It's not funny joke.
It's a fight for editing.
OK, some just why not?
You know, why'd you got to be hatin?
I want to fucking die when I watch that sort of shit.
Because I'm thinking, do I do that with my doggo pictures?
I'm like, maybe every like for a word like any word sparing.
Yeah, it's like at the end, like I'm asking a question rhetorically and I go,
no, and it zooms in for that one word and then we're back to normal.
And we don't he starts to zoom in at the beginning of a joke.
Like here it comes.
You guys get ready for the epic laws.
And then the answer is really like silly.
And then it goes back to normal.
Janice Cohen said sudden realization.
Quinton didn't have time to unpack his apartment fully enough to unbox
all the things he needs for his work.
But he did have enough time to pull out the sex doll.
All the sex doll that requires several people to carry.
I mean, you don't want to be alone when you go to sleep that night.
I can put up my precious fucking acoustic tiles or I could get my sex doll
propped up for the camera.
One of these, it's more important than the other in a matching outfit.
Yeah.
And dress her and dress it.
Did you fucking assume the gender rags?
What of the sex doll?
Yeah, that's important.
What did I say the gender was because I can't remember.
I said she.
Yeah, I'm being generous.
No, it's not alive.
The whole randomly zooming in on stuff.
I don't actually have a problem with it in general.
It's just when when you only have that when that's your only tool.
When that's supposed to be the joke, not to.
No, that's a joke zooming in and abrupt cuts away in the middle of like a word.
Like those are the two sudden noises.
And I and I know those things because I use those things and I'm not funny.
Oh, well, there you go.
Oh, thank you.
I think it's sweet of you.
I think you're all fucking generally.
Oh, yeah.
And Aiden said she sent me a Quinton's DM calling JK a turf for supporting chromosomes existing.
Oh, really?
That's hilarious.
To be clear, the doll is probably more expensive than the tiles and his fans did pay for it.
Yes, objectively, it is tiles are like fucking 100 for like a 24 pec.
I yeah, I agree.
Or this situation.
I'm sorry.
I was asking about my my let's let's let's work on what's happening.
Why does he think that would be how it plays out?
This is so incredibly dishonest for him to try and see how is this people.
Thanks to Ryan Johnson.
Fucking it up.
People are like see her parents.
It wouldn't have mad if her parent was John who worked at the local bar or Emperor Palpatine.
It's like, what do you mean?
There's major implications for how you're viewed by everybody.
What your potential is in this universe in terms of like it was that thing I had in that clip.
And it's like, is the how do people look at her now?
How does that change people?
Like, how does how does Finn feel about it knowing she's a Palpatine?
She's the granddaughter of the guy who would just arbitrarily blow up planets of people is like,
well, and I feel like it changes a few things.
Don't tell Ray why Snoke wanted her.
Because she was she should be in the film confused as fuck as to why does Snoke give a shit about me?
I'm just some chick.
And then he's like, oh, yeah, you're the granddaughter of Palpatine.
And then there's the whole like giving any reason for it to be tempted to the dark side
because she's perfect.
So like, you go, I don't know, your grandfather was the darkest side, dark side person there was.
And you should be like,
Blacker than the blackest black times infinity.
And I suppose then the question becomes like, yes, yes, yes.
These are all details that are like outside of her character, though.
What does it matter to her character?
And I should be like, well, maybe you were supposed to take care of her character alongside doing this stuff.
Who you are, who your family is has oftentimes a huge impact on who you are.
That's true.
This is kind of what I'm getting at.
Like if they'd actually focused on giving her a character and this was going on as well.
There's lots to play with.
Yeah, what is your perspective of this?
Nazism.
How would you feel if Emperor Palpatine was your granddaddy?
Oh, pretty good.
Oh, fucking say that right there.
I'm going to when he dies, I'm going to get an empire.
Yeah, I mean, a lot of pros.
Wouldn't that be an interesting question?
He like offers it to her and she's like she talks to Finn about how if she takes over,
she can make it a force for good.
That could be a there's an ethical issue there.
Absolutely.
That would be really interesting.
Rey becomes the empress of the first order and tries to turn things around.
And all of the it's a shame in a way, but it's it would work in this sense.
But since all of the stormtroopers and everything are brainwashed anyway,
they'll just do what they're told.
They don't have like an ideological real position on whatever it is the first order is about,
which still hasn't been explained.
Don't just be like, OK, yeah, sure.
I just like the quintet if he's in the scene with them and Kylo says your grandfather's Palpatine.
The quiz like, well, that doesn't really matter.
He's like, what?
This doesn't matter.
You fucking kidding me right now.
Like seriously, he's like, well, you know.
Well, it's like it's like having nobody prepared.
She's like, what do you mean?
It's like, what if you woke up one day and the police came knocking on your door and said,
hey, by the way, we find out that your father is actually like a mass murdering serial killer.
He's responsible for hundreds and hundreds of deaths.
And he like raped children and kicked puppies and all sorts of terrible things.
And you're like, oh, fuck.
Yeah, like that would probably have an impact on you.
That would probably change the way that you love people and how you value lineages.
And I think I think you could have a lot of conflict there.
Like Finn could be standoffish with her.
And she's like, really, dude, he's not me.
And he's like, I know.
That would have been interesting.
But Quentin just treats it like this is a joke scenario that would have been stupid
and dumb and like, no, that there's something there.
Yeah, that's something to clarify, by the way, because like, you know,
I advocated for the potential of her being related to Palpatine.
The main source of that is the fact that we need an explanation for a ridiculous power
with no training, right?
It's like the it's almost like an ejector seat for making sense.
Like, this is all we got, guys.
This is the best we've got.
This is all we could do.
We're stuck.
But then, you know, there's also like, but what interesting things can we do with with that?
And like, I think that people could be like, see, you got what you wanted.
It rises Skywalker.
I'd be like, but they didn't do anything with it.
They were just like, yeah, it's just Palpatine lol.
Okay.
Yay.
Did it, guys.
Nailed it.
Right.
Simply matter is that they have no effect on Rey or her friends or the plot of the films
or the importance of the narrative or really anything.
And more importantly, they can.
Like, the fact that Ryan made it irrelevant and then JJ didn't do a lot with it,
is he almost like played with it.
JJ, when he had the the false vision of her being an evil to him,
he's like, look, like, yeah, I don't really know what's going on here.
In fact, when she had a scary Bilbo teeth, I was confused.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna roll him back as well.
Better is that they have no effect on Rey or her friends or the plot of the films or the
importance of the narrative or really anything.
And more importantly, it doesn't answer the biggest question that the audience has in their
mind, which is what is the point of the sequel films?
Is this all just going to be the original trilogy, but with better special effects?
Is there going to be an actual point to the fact that I've become
invested in all of these movies?
And are you?
I guess he's asking for like a more meaningful point to the three of them as a whole.
I got nothing.
I mean, not like this, you're gonna you if you want something meaningful,
you got to work for it.
Like, I think I put a tweet out about this, but I was like,
if you're going to be as generous as possible, and like,
what is the unifying element of the three films in terms of a point they're trying to make?
It's like, you, you choose your own identity.
It's not defined by like other people.
I think is what they're going for.
In Finn, you can totally try and say like he wasn't defined by the institution that he was
brought up in.
Ray.
He broke free of the institutional racism.
Yes.
Ray became a free man.
She chose to be a different family because her current one was a dick.
And then Poe, I've got nothing.
Poe is just sort of there.
He drives a he drives a ship.
Pew pew.
Also, everything he does is evil, according to other characters,
even though he's probably the person who did the most there outside of Ray.
It's a mess of a trilogy is the point.
Yep.
All of these questions by subverting the audience's expectations.
Kylo Ren goes from the Anakin Skywalker figure waiting to be redeemed to the Palpatine figure,
the mass murderer whose motivations are exclusively that he's hungry for power.
This is something even his own mother admits.
Ben Solo is dead.
There is no going back.
Well, she was fucking wrong then, wasn't she?
Yeah, I don't know.
TLJ doesn't seem to give up on on Kylo at the end, though.
You remember when he picks up the dice?
I thought the point was trying to be like, you know, he's not.
That's been my issue with it the whole time is that it's like he might be a good,
but he might be good.
Well, even when Luke made a space apparition instead of showing up in person,
which was confirmed he could have done when he shows up as an apparition, he he's like,
I don't even want to talk to you.
I'm going to be standoffish and a dick to you.
Oh, yeah.
I remember what he says.
I'm going to try to reason or understand.
That's the library.
You can save my soul.
Luke's such an asshole.
Oh, yeah, that's Luke.
Yeah, that's Luke Skywalker.
He just fucking gave up on Kylo.
He absolutely gave up on Kylo.
Imagine being related to Kylo, though.
That would suck.
That would suck.
You're like, geez, this is all I got left.
You're like layers around.
You're like, well, I guess I'll give him my ex-girlfriend's dice.
He's a very interesting character, Luke.
The attempt to redeem him would be an insult to the impossibly high amount of people that
he has personally slain for no motivation outside of his own greed.
That's motivation.
In that case, Quentin's saying you cannot be redeemed once you've killed enough people,
I guess.
I guess.
Sorry, Darth Vader.
But I guess we talked about the earlier.
But there's a difference between being I mean, redemption is a complicated thing.
It's not like a binary sort of.
Oh, yeah.
All's forgiven.
You're good.
Guys, for 15 minutes into the video, and he has only mentioned Rise of Skywalker,
like early in this video.
He's only mentioned its last scene.
Then the first scene, it opens up like this massive tangent.
And at the end.
Oh, all right.
Chad's book, I believe he was talking about how that his book tackles the idea of redemption
and how far can someone go before they can no longer be redeemed.
Read his book, Quentin.
Do it.
You won't do it.
Realizes that she needs to read Matt's book other than her friends and that that's okay,
because she can continue fighting for good without trying to protect some sort of personal legacy.
Through this, the mysticism of the Jedi is reborn again.
Anyone can do is always like that.
Yeah, anyone.
Yeah, this was it was always like that.
It was never not like that.
You can be a Jedi, I can be a Jedi, Broom Boy can be a Jedi.
That's the whole fucking that's what everybody likes about stalls in the first place.
Everybody was pretending to be Jedi.
This isn't like we no one was surprised by this.
Jedi could come from anywhere.
I mean, look at Anakin.
The point of that scene, it's a beautiful moment.
We have a more interesting bad guy.
No, it's not interesting.
Once again, something of a bad guy.
It's not interesting.
Once again, something approachable.
More interesting back.
It's all about Kylo.
Yeah.
Is he talking about Kylo?
All wrong in the sense that he's interestingly just inconsistent.
That people often describe as interesting because they've got nothing else to really
pit down.
It's like he's I can't figure him out.
He must be interesting.
It's like, no, he's just shit.
So it's a weird.
I don't know.
What's the nicest thing you can say about him as a character?
He's got a he's got a great bod.
All right.
I'm not wrong.
Oh, as a character.
Oh, the best thing that I could say about him as a character.
Oh, well, he's focused.
Is he?
Yeah, he's got determination.
Is he?
He's yeah.
He seems to flip flop a lot in terms of what do you mean?
Like of whatever thing he's currently into.
He's very focused on.
Yeah, I guess.
Sure.
Let's go with that.
Okay.
That's my answer.
There we go.
We did it.
We did it, guys.
We have an interesting bad guy.
Audience.
And the ending of the film sets up a final movie that has to be something more creative
than just episode six.
It doesn't even have to be creative.
Just like solidly written.
Like don't get this happens in video games.
But we see this in video games and movies all the time.
They try to make this super complicated, deep galaxy brain, triple decker bus of a story.
When they should just have something really simple.
That's well executed.
Episode six, but bigger is what you're here.
Everyone's wanting to do.
So he just fucking ignores everything and makes episode six, but bigger anyways.
There's a moment in episode eight where Kyler and looks at his mask
and he recognizes that he only wears the mask in order to emulate Darth Vader.
And he realized
the motivation for wearing a mask is pretty like I don't even know.
Do we ever even find out beyond the idea that he seems to be a Vader fanboy?
Because the Knights of Rental wear masks.
I don't know why they wear masks.
Do they?
I mean, wearing a mask is an intimidating thing.
Even if you don't need a mask, the anonymity of masks and the design that they can have and
putting in, you know, it's a very intimidating thing.
Remember Snoke describes it as silly and it's like, Snoke, where have you been, buddy?
He's been wearing this thing for a while.
I get that Ryan hates the mask.
Just now with the breaking point.
That's what I mean.
Like it was weird.
I assumed it was more to the mask than just,
I want to hide behind a mask and look like Vader.
It's like, okay.
Well, all right.
I guess I like audiences were like, man, that mask is cool.
The voice and like, it was kind of nifty.
It was kind of weird seeing Adam Driver's head behind it, but that mask is really wow.
Yes.
Kind of imposing, but himself and he smashes the thing into the wall
and this represents him and the trilogy becoming individualized.
They're all individualized.
Wait, wait.
I also have a comment on the video right now.
It's like he couldn't even be bothered to center the camera.
He's not in frame.
I just realized that's why I said this.
That's why I said this editing was weird.
Yeah, it's like he made sure the sex doll was.
Instead of making the scene you're showing bigger, he just zooms into it.
Yeah, that's what he does.
You know what's really fucking about that sex doll?
It looks like Onision.
It's like really creeping me out on a deep subconscious level.
I suppose Quinton had the choice of several if he went with Onision one.
I mean, his sex doll is a top.
Oh, my God.
Guys, I'm going to need some fucking researchers on this.
Get on that.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to use the loon.
I'll be right back.
Discuss Onision's doll amongst yourselves.
What a strange collection of things.
Well, you got the Mickey Mouse doll, a sex doll, a Dalek and a transformer.
If you walked into this guy's house, you would assume he's got like some bodies locked away.
Frightening, to say the least.
Like, I know it's like funny internet, like jokes and like visuals.
But if like camera aside, if you saw this, you would have some very deep.
If you took a girl home, I don't know if you straight or not.
If you took a girl home, you probably have a lot of fucking apprehension.
Yeah, about continuing seeing this man, man.
She would say that'd be like, I'd like to explain to you what a red flag is.
She leans in, she leans in to kiss him and she asks,
OK, why does your face smell like used panties?
On the first date, we got that far.
That's ridiculous.
Leading in for a kiss.
What do you mean?
Generous.
Play creation.
So it all looks disappointed.
It does.
This is my life.
Rolling its eyes.
Perpetually.
Yeah, what do you think about the sex doll?
I need your commentary.
Oh, it looks like Disney's having a lot of fun with it.
Greg and Disney are going to make their own sex dolls eventually.
Disney plus adult section.
I don't know.
I was just thinking like you just like you liked Darth Vader.
How do you like him now?
And you're like, oh, oh, no.
Disney, please.
Can you order that directly from the comfort of your own couch on this plus?
I would hope so.
Ripe for business.
And they have like you can you can set it up so that they have like
confirmed deliverers that can get into your house and deliver it directly to your sofa.
And you're like, oh, yeah, thank you.
Address it for you.
All you've got on is like a pillow covering your crotch.
Set it down right there.
Thank you.
Yes, perfect.
Do I owe you anything?
Like, let me leave.
Can I go?
You got to sign this thing.
Please just sign it.
First of all, I won't sign until you sit down.
I've got to test it.
How about a collaboration?
Need you to help me test it.
Need you.
It's in your goddamn job description.
You got to give me a five star review.
You guys still talking about sex, sex, Dolanisium?
Yes.
Yes.
And Quentin's incredible editing.
What did it accomplish with being that?
Few other Star Wars films have literally just chosen to be a different Star Wars film,
but with a larger scale.
What was the purpose of doing all that?
Is this entire sequel franchise just going to be the original trilogy, but on a bigger scale?
And what makes me love The Last Jedi is that all of these qualms and more are addressed within the
film.
Even if it's in a way, these questions can really be answered in a way that will satisfy
the long hunger that the audience has had for them.
There are no potential answers to any of these mystery box questions that don't.
I must have dragged him back more than I intended to.
You must have.
Yeah, this seems familiar.
It doesn't answer the biggest question that the audience has in their mind.
We're at least at 15.
Oh, okay.
Our friends and that that's okay, because she can continue fighting for good
without trying to protect some sort of personal legacy.
Through this, the mysticism of the Jedi is reborn again.
Anyone can be a Jedi.
You can be a Jedi.
I can be a Jedi.
Broom Boy can be a Jedi.
I didn't think they fucking got a Jedi.
That's the point of that scene.
It's a beautiful moment.
We have a more interesting-
Do you think the Jedi farming factory-
I didn't catch that he described Broom Boy as a beautiful moment.
A beautiful moment.
It's a beautiful advertisement for future Star Wars.
Oh, Broom Boy.
Just do it.
Does he think that the Jedi Order just had like fucking Jedi baby factories
and they'd farm them and pluck them off the trees when they were ripe?
Yes.
Well, there you go.
I didn't.
Star Wars, Star Wars Valley.
With that, yeah.
Yeah, there's some in there, but I'm not that invested, so let's continue.
Nothing bad, guy.
The Force is once again something approachable to the audience.
The ending of the film sets up a final movie that has to be something more creative.
It does not set up anything.
Yeah, I mean, it's-
No, I think he's right, but not in the way that he means.
You gotta be pretty fucking creative to make the end of the last Jedi good.
So I'll agree with him on that.
It's like he was passed a baton while running,
and then he passes the next guy at Advil.
You're like, ow, okay, wow, I gotta rub with this.
All right, this is, mm-hmm, okay, I can do it.
I think it rides like, bye.
Thanks.
Then just episode six, but bigger.
But doing episode six, but bigger is what Juju Abrams wanted to do,
so he just fucking ignores everything and makes up-
Okay, I gotta take some issue.
The plot of episode nine was a disaster that has nothing to do with the plot of episode six.
I can see the ending, but how can someone call episode nine a bigger remake of episode six,
considering all of the stupid knife and the stupid McGuffins and the stupid-
Mueller, I think yesterday I told you that Rise of Skywalker was like 37 movies crammed
into a blender and then spat out and then sprinkled with Star Wars stuff.
Like I said, the ending, I can see it.
For the rest of it, nah, if someone said,
the plot, it's just like episode six, but bigger.
I'd be like, where's the sand monster vagina thing?
Give me that, hmm?
Where's the big vision of that?
I'm outraged.
I want that big pussy, yes.
Episode six, but bigger anyways.
There's a moment in episode eight where Kylo Ren looks at his mask,
and he recognizes that he only wears the mask in order to emulate Darth Vader,
and he realizes that-
Again, this happens after he's called stupid for wearing it,
rather than, like it's a silly thing.
There's not, I don't know, I feel like you're reading a little into it that he's like,
I don't want to be like Darth Vader no more.
He's not Darth Vader, he's no one but himself,
and he smashes the thing into the wall, and this represents him-
I know where he's going with it, but just a JJ repaired the mask.
Just like, yeah, it's funny.
It's so unnecessary and yet funny.
And the trilogy becoming individualized, their own separate entities.
And then at the start of episode nine,
Kylo Ren pulls all the pieces to his mask out of his junk drawer,
and super glues them back together and puts the mask back on.
I feel this is the most clear metaphor for what episode nine is in relation to episode eight.
I think we'd all agree with that.
Yeah, he didn't.
He fucking hated that Ryan destroyed that cool mask.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
I think, like, I was that-
When I was the baddest at Matt Garbo's autistic brother, yes.
It was that, like, not leak, but inside post or whatever,
about how, like, JJ Abrams actually really hated TLJ behind the scenes,
and I'm like, I could totally believe it after seeing his movie.
Absolutely.
The Luke thing was just, like, a big fuck you to Ryan Johnson.
I think that's probably the most over one, right?
Like, this deserves more respect.
It's like, wow.
And I'd be like, yeah, you should fucking treat that thing with more respect.
I want to see, like, I want to watch the entirety of Ryan watching the film.
I sort of be, like, sitting in front of him, staring at him, like, go on, react.
I also think, oh, yeah, sorry, go ahead, Mauler.
I was just going to say, in favor of corporatism and stuff,
I imagine he'd be like, I really liked it.
It was a very good film.
He had to say it.
And I'd like to think that there was a line against Holdo.
You remember in TLJ when Holdo was like, you bet the resistance on bad odds.
And then we find out that the Holdo maneuver was a billion for one shot.
Oh, my God.
Oh, that's great.
I actually, yeah, because the amount of like, she I think we talked about this on our stream
about the film, but the this film essentially tells us that she's just an incompetent coward.
She tried to run away and she accidentally because she spun a wheel that had a million
points of results and she hit the one that ends up in her dying.
She's like, God damn it.
She's like, I did it.
This is the thing.
They interpret that as she saved the world.
It's like, guys, she was trying to run away.
Did you get it?
Now she's a hero.
No, no, no, no.
Yeah, obviously.
In response to Snoke being killed, the films bring back Palpatine.
So once again, Kylo Ren can be the Anakin Skywalker figure
waiting to defeat the Emperor figure to be redeemed.
The force is once again rewritten to be all about blood ties.
Ray.
No, it isn't her.
No, it's about her specifically.
Not to mention.
Finn has the force tisms in this movie.
If you remember when, when Ray is force sensitive,
you know, when Ray, quote unquote, dies, he's like, oh, my God.
I feel to tell you something.
And Epstein didn't kill himself.
Well, I think she Ray would know that she's a little she's
on the mission.
That's the one.
Oh, man, I just like that.
It's about bloodlines again.
It's like, I mean, what's Finn's bloodline?
Finn Skywalker.
It's the it's called the Skywalker saga.
What did you expect?
I mean, Jesus Christ.
Yeah, I mean, I mean, I guess what he's trying to say is that
I think he misses the point that the Jedi could be anyone could be a Jedi.
I think he missed that because I don't know.
He didn't watch the prequels that much because the prequels,
like the Jedi Knights were like, they weren't like
Skywalkers, but they were still Jedi.
And I, I don't know why he's so focused on the bloodline.
It's just it's their story.
This I'm just that makes sense.
Like, I guess.
Well, because like our issue with it isn't that she has power.
It's that she's the most powerful being in the history of the world.
And we're like, how come?
Like, what is it that and I guess he liked the idea that, yeah,
it's just there is no reason anybody can be the most powerful just like that.
And we're all like, but oh, yeah, you have to earn the things you get in life.
Like, yeah, yes, there is a thing such as talent.
But it goes a little further than that.
Like you can't like all the greatest people at all different crafts.
They weren't born the best at those crafts.
And yeah, actually, that that last scene in the in the last Jedi,
when the kid just magically knows how to manipulate the broom
without being told how to I did actually didn't like that.
I'm fine with that because it's really simple.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I'm I'm okay with that.
Yeah, because just pulling a light broom towards you.
I'm like, that's probably something you could figure out on your own.
And he wasn't like under stress or duress while he was doing it.
Um, so I'm fine with that.
If he was trying, if it's something complicated or something really big,
I mean, yeah, that's weird.
But I think you could sell I think if you figure out your force sensitive,
you might not know it's the force.
You might not know about the Jedi and stuff, but you're like,
Oh, maybe if I concentrate and practice this thing I could do, I can make it better.
It's like every other skill that I have.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Sorry.
So if she just had a degree of power that was on par with just the random Jedi we
probably saw in the prequels or whatever, we'd probably be much more forgiving.
But holy fuck, she do some incredible stuff.
Those boulders, she moved bad.
Yoda would have been like, Whoa, how do you do that?
Yeah, even even when Yoda pulled out the X-wing, he had some difficulty with that.
Yeah.
Remember when lifting a spaceship out of water was kind of difficult?
Simpler times, Rags.
Simpler times.
There's the force because she has superior genes that she inherited from her grandfather.
And the porgs are no longer nested in the Falcon.
That might seem like the smallest of issues.
What?
But to me, it's one of the most spineless.
What?
That was spineless!
Guys, I need help reacting to something.
I must have heard him wrong.
I need to hear the whole thing because I feel like I'm in a different
universe that he just complained about that.
And the pores are no longer nested in the Falcon.
How do we know?
We don't actually know that.
Yeah, one, we don't actually know that for sure.
Two, it's been a year.
They may have cleared the board.
That's probably the porgs lifespan.
It's not even, why would you want them nesting in the Falcon?
You'd be like, you don't want wild animals taking up residence inside of your ship
where they could chew and wires.
Not only is it actually dangerous for the porgs,
but it's also like, don't fuck up our extremely important missions.
Oh my God.
I remember Jenny Nicholson's video for some reason.
Doesn't she have all the porgs there also?
Um, oh, he's, yeah, this is, this is what he was triggering in my head, by the way.
He put out a tweet about this.
Yeah.
Which doesn't make any sense at all.
He's like, oh, it's been a year.
There should still be porgs there.
Like nobody gave a shit and just left them.
He's like, no, it would be weird if they were still there.
Yeah, that would be a weird thing.
Oh, of course.
I should gedelb this.
That's true.
What should the gedelb line be?
What did he describe it as?
Spineless.
Spineless.
Spineless.
No, no, the most spineless thing.
Yeah, yeah, the most spineless, I think.
Disgusting.
Spineless.
So that's his biggest problem with the rice of Skywalker is the spineless thing they did.
The porgs were not, I mean, forget Rose Tico being sidelined.
The porgs, man.
They didn't get, oh, they were only in for like two seconds
on that stupid fucking island that we saw again.
I don't know what to say.
An interesting take, Quentin.
Maybe this is his chud take, the ones that chud will be upset about.
And the porgs are no longer nested in the Falcon.
That might seem like the smallest of issues, but to me, it's one of the most spineless
because the fact that the porgs had nested in the Falcon was just adorable
and would definitely have made several scenes in this movie a lot easier to handle.
Like I said, I sort of forced myself to find...
They weren't cute, they were weird.
They are strange.
They're strange animals.
Chewbacca is my hero for consuming them in front of their relatives.
Yeah, I went on a whole rant when the first Last Jedi trailer came out.
I was like, why does anyone like this shit?
They've got really deep, like dark shark eyes.
They have fangs for some reason.
They kind of like have this penguin body.
Like they're all over the place, aesthetically.
Kill them.
Shit!
Kill the porgs!
Beautiful.
Most of this whiplash to be amusing to the extent that I didn't get mad about it in the theater.
But the one thing that did really piss me off
was how Rian Johnson said to himself while making the Last Jedi,
there's not enough Asian representation in Hollywood.
They're like overrepresented though.
Here we go.
There's barely any Asians and they're overrepresented in Hollywood.
What does he mean by underrepresented?
I mean that all of everyone should be equal.
Or does he mean in relation to the amount of people that are in the population in general?
Because you'd never know.
If it's equal to the percentage of the population, they're overrepresented in Hollywood.
Mm-hmm.
But if they should have exactly the same as every other color and creed,
then they're not rags, you racist.
I guess I am.
And Ryan tried to fix that racism.
And what did JJ do?
He shat on it.
I guess he expects all the numbers to be even.
Like as many white people as we see in Hollywood.
We're supposed to see many Asians, Blacks, South Asians, whatever the fuck.
But it's like-
Yeah, that's how it works.
What do you expect Hollywood to do, Quinton?
Round these people up on a ship and ship them here?
And that's just-
We've already done that.
That's not even going into sexual preference and what they identify as
and their political leanings and what their favorite fucking flavor of pie is.
It's no end.
I personally, I want to see more pie enthusiasts in movies.
It's just my take.
Cake, no pie.
Cake, no pie.
Waffles.
You know what's underrepresented as a pie?
Boysenberry.
I think Nazis as good guys are underrepresented.
So there.
I'm thinking a rhubarb pie deserves a little bit more identification immediately.
Enough love for rhubarb, like publicly.
Rhubarb.
It's good.
Rhubarb sounds like a really, that sounds like a Star Wars name for a character.
It kind of does.
Like Jondu Rhubarb or something.
Jondu Rhubarb.
Jondu Rhubarb.
Classic Jedi Master Rhubarb.
Jedi Master Jondu Rhubarb.
Is that to be Rhubarb?
The Jedi Master Jondu Rhubarb.
Four spies.
While making The Last Jedi, there's not enough Asian representation in Hollywood.
I want to introduce an Asian main character to this trilogy.
And JJ Abrams responded by going, no.
Yeah, because your character was shit and pointless.
No, no, no.
Yeah, I'm sure someone asked me when.
No, he's using his own merchandise cup.
Screen cut that.
I like what he kept this in.
I'm curious if it's going to be like a bitch plug for in a second.
But yeah, the like, I'm sorry.
She's just so the fact that they've got a black main character, a female main character,
and a Hispanic main character accounts for nothing because they didn't have an Asian main character.
Obviously, it's like that doesn't command.
It's a minefield trying to please these people.
You're like, is this cool?
They're like, no, unless you do it this very specific way.
You're like, OK, I did it.
Then some other subgroup are like, no, you got to do it this way.
You're like, oh, Jesus Christ.
OK, you didn't have our group in there.
No, no, correct.
She's not.
She's not a main character.
She can be in the movie.
She's lucky that she got the main character.
She wasn't a main character to begin with.
Yeah, she was a secondary.
And she was a bad secondary character.
Remember the iconic scene where she said love will win while the base is being destroyed.
That was such a great moment for Star Wars.
This is what I mean.
The stupid conversation can't go anywhere because they're always like,
you're racist.
You don't like her.
It's like, but she's awful.
It's got nothing to do with it being Asian.
Yeah, so why aren't you mad at Ryan Jones?
Why aren't you mad at Ryan Johnson for watching and making people hate her?
Why aren't you mad at that?
Yeah, that's what you need to be mad at.
Why didn't he make a lovable character that we were really wanting to see?
This is on him.
Maybe he hates Asians.
Bad female Asian driver.
Like, that's what you want to be.
What's what you want Asians to be represented as.
Because that's what she wants in that movie.
How much Inuit representation is there?
Almost none.
What a fucking racist piece of shit.
I don't care about the Asian character.
We need the Inuit character.
She needed to be in an igloo.
That's what it was.
That space igloo.
Oh my god, that's so racist.
But in the Inuit's live in igloos, even though it's what they do.
Whoa.
See, I never said that.
You've connected dots that are so racist.
I can't even see them.
Oh my god, your racism is so powerful.
It transcended my ability to stand out.
Being like the rebellion group scenes.
And I'll give her lines.
Basically the lines I would have given Admiral Ackbar.
But no, she's not a lead.
Admiral Ackbar's a better character.
She got people killed.
You fucking puppet.
Yeah, she's quite a horrible creature actually.
Like in terms of a character.
If only like the insanity that she was just zapping people and capturing them.
Whether or not they're even a part of the resistance.
That's her opening.
You can't leave.
You must die with us.
I'm like, whoa, fucking hell.
How many video essays did we watch, right?
They would be like, Finn was abandoning the resistance that he was fighting for.
It's like, no, he never agreed to that.
He was a dude who was not cool with the First Order and wanted to save Ray.
That was his story.
He was like, Ray's captured.
I want to save her.
It's like, oh, this resistance thing is a thing too.
You never fucking signed up.
How about that?
He's like, okay then.
Well, yeah, it destroys everyone's narratives about how much of a coward he is in the opening.
Instead, it's just, yeah, I'm not a part of this war.
I want out.
I just like the, I have a friend called Ray that I want to look after.
It's like, no, you're a coward now.
Yeah.
It's like, she's my friend.
That doesn't mean I have to be on her team.
And that brings it to questions like, is Ray even a part of the resistance?
Like, I guess.
Sort of.
She does stuff that they want.
So I guess, sure.
Yeah, I guess we should probably mention if people are unaware of this,
but there's like a huge thing on Twitter about like Rose Tico deserved better or
Calibri Tran deserved better.
It's like, what the fuck?
Treat it like she was murdered.
Didn't they show her in the fucking, in this movie, like six, maybe seven times.
And she just like kind of.
She had like three minutes of screen time or something.
Yeah, I think they calculated it.
It was like a minute and 17 seconds, I think.
Oh, too much.
Too much.
Yeah, way too much.
Way too much.
Way too much.
Like her lines were just like, look over there.
I think we talked about it before, but just Finn's like, come with us.
And she's like, I got to scan some deaths.
Yeah, destroyers.
And it's just like, fuck off with the issue, the dialogue as well.
Sorry, she's not a main character.
I know this doesn't want to happen,
but it truly feels like JJ Abrams responded to the massive harassment
that Kelly massive harassment received.
Still don't even believe that happened.
I still don't even believe I don't believe that was real.
I don't believe she got any more than most actors get.
Because if anything, if she had and they could prove it,
oh, man, you'd think she'd say something about it.
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah.
This green cap bitch.
Because she was in this movie by putting her in the movie list
to make them more happy.
What the fuck?
Because he still wanted them to.
Why?
This is your mind on subjectivity.
You go nuts.
You start like creating all these conspiracy things.
JJ just took it out to please the people who harass.
What is more likely?
He is pandering to racists or the character was bad.
You're at and he can't figure out how to put her in the movie.
I mean, pandering to racists, obviously.
In the boardroom, they're like, right.
We've panned into the Raylow fans.
We've panned into the people didn't like TLJ.
Now we've got the racists over here.
They have like a guy to represent the racist.
He's like, yeah.
So these are our demands.
If you could just satisfy any of these five.
A race.
Yeah, he was in that boardroom.
When the meeting happened, I can get that KKK dollar.
This is this Rose Tico character.
Can you get rid of her?
They're like, she's our favorite.
He classifies the first order is Nazis.
So why didn't they just make the Nazi characters look like good characters
if they wanted to pander to races?
Well, this is the thing that would be too overt.
When they say that like the makers are racist,
they'll often be like, well, they're subtle about it or whatever.
I just be like, no, you're just incompetent at this point.
Oh, yeah.
So Quentin, so Quentin's the only galaxy brain who can see the races.
We're just we're just like, we're just fucking puppets.
We're we're unwoke.
We're not as woke as he is.
He sees through the lies of the Hollywood.
He knows what's truly happening.
But yes, go on, Quentin.
It was how unfathomable that it could have been that she's just a shitty character.
What ridiculous world that would be.
Not possible for an Asian woman.
Not possible possible.
Because he still wanted them to be able to buy tickets without getting mad.
So literally, they didn't know that until they watched the film.
Like, yes, if they'd read the leaks, they'd know that she wasn't did it very much.
But from the trailers, I guess you could probably gather that she's not in it very much too.
But she was in one of the trailers like so.
Just the idea that it's like he did it so that they would buy the tickets.
It's like, but they could they wouldn't the racists wouldn't have known for sure that she wasn't in it.
It's such a dumb thing to be so funny.
I thought she was kept on all the trailers, but she's the main character.
The racist like, no, move over, Ray.
It's Rose Tico time.
It's Tico time.
It's like he's validating the people who were harassing her.
Okay.
Maybe this is the last year I've discovered.
All right, I guess.
Pissing off white supremacists.
Why are we talking about white supremacists?
What the fuck?
I guess it is.
I guess this is the part.
I mean, all those people like like these people legit believe, I guess,
that if you didn't like Rose Tico as a character, you're a white fucking supremacist.
That's so dumb, man.
Jesus Christ.
I just this.
How does how does this sentence conclude?
In the last year, I have discovered that pissing off white supremacists dot, dot, dot.
You're like, where where you go with this?
I mean, if we're sticking to stereotypes, white men love Asian girls.
So yeah.
What's up?
Yeah, we like.
Yeah, we like pretty Asian women.
At least Quinn's committing to the whole random harsh political takes.
It is.
Well, I I'll take that back.
It's like Kelly Rietrand isn't ugly.
They just like made her ugly for Star Wars, which is.
Oh, yeah.
People have shipped images of her like in promotional stuff.
And it's like, why did they frump her in the movies?
Like, why did they go out of their way to make her look ugly?
Weird.
That must be the hair, the anime hair that Ryan gave her, the weird like
like rise, you're like a fucking upside down show.
Yeah, really, really weird hair.
You know, whatever.
It's me.
But in the last year, I've discovered that pissing off white supremacists
is the most easy and fun thing to do in the world.
How can you say that with the team that you're a part of?
Like you guys have turned into currency.
You know what a lot of them like to do is just say really dumb shit on Twitter
and then people call them on it and they go,
look at all these fucking pissed off white supremacists in my mentions.
It's like always the same exact formula.
Oh, yeah, that's like Sean's whole account.
It's just parody now, right?
Like you just posts things to piss people off, but that's the account.
So I'm trying to be smug about it.
Yeah, like if you react to it, you're an idiot.
And Chase, have you seen the trend where they go muted,
blocked as if it's some sort of I've muted this entire thread
because all the angry fucking neckbeards keep responding.
It's like, okay, I said something on social media and people replied to it.
Well, I fans now.
And the crazy thing is they think that's a win.
It's like, oh, yeah, that's the thing you can do.
Makes them an ally.
I like that as his appealing is like JJ pissed them off.
It's fun.
It's like they brag about their block list.
It's like, no, no, that makes you a little bitch.
That doesn't make you an amazing virtue, a small insulated child.
Yeah, it was a pretty good pause, actually.
Twitter is just if I ever if I ever kill myself and you guys find out
that I did it after the fact, just assume it was probably Twitter's fault to some degree.
Find you in your apartment with a belt around your neck and Twitter in your hand.
Yeah, cock in your hands.
Yeah, that's probably more like I was gonna leave that to the imagination.
But I'll experiment gone wrong.
And don't get me wrong.
It will end with you having less income than when you weren't doing it.
Oh, he saw.
Yeah, the white supremacist took away my money.
The white his I guess he's tried to say that he pissed off his audience and a
lot of them were white supremacists.
I guess I'm an unlikable shoulder.
It doesn't make me like I'm ironically coincidentally your lesser money coming in
more than likely tides your decision that in your mainline videos, you fucking gave up.
I can't be asked to edit anymore.
Yeah, can't be any of that.
Can't be your stupid fucking worthless garbage.
It can't be that it's because of the white apprentices stop giving you money.
It was like, okay.
All right.
All right, Quinton, whatever helps you sleep at night.
But in response, you get the instant gratification of knowing that Nazis hate you.
And oh, baby, that's priceless.
He said this before.
It's the most like pat on the back comments he ever does.
Like Nazis don't like me.
It's like, it's kind of sad like me.
Doesn't matter.
The other meme from Rick and Morty where Jerry has a t-shirt with his own face on it.
He's really happy about himself.
Like it's supposed to be the idealized version of him being of his own ass.
I just pictured that with Quinton.
He's got his own face on his own t-shirt drinking from his mug that has his face on it.
And he's just like, I hate Nazis.
I'm a good man.
You're like, you did it, man.
And then another Quinton walks in the room and puts his hand on his shoulder.
Like, good job, buddy.
You did it.
Good for you, man.
Nazis hate you.
Yeah, I'm trying to say I'm a really good person.
He's a good person.
I'm like the most benevolent kind of person that exists.
And just want to remind you, if Nazis hate you, you must be virtuous.
The Nazis didn't hate any other terrible group of people.
And as we know, all of the greatest virtuous people of planet Earth's history,
they all announced it.
And the bitter irony is like the white supremacist,
white supremacist will be the first people he joins up with in prison to be the bitch.
Because the blacks won't even want him.
No, no, no, guys, I'm on your side.
I'm an ally.
This cracker's talking about.
It's okay, guys.
I hate white people, too.
That's what he'll add, ironically.
White people are the worst.
Just switch over.
Can we all agree on it?
Guys, can I get a fucking, can I get like a three in chat if we all just hate white people?
I bet all of you are here unjustly.
Like, white people's heartbeats.
They must be stopped.
And then, peace and justice for our new empire.
In response, you get the instant gratification of knowing that Nazis hate you.
And oh, baby, that's priceless.
So alongside those being written out, the movie also introduces a bunch of...
Good pat on the back there, and you rise to Skywalker review.
Yeah, I know, right?
Like, I think we're finally getting there, though.
I think we're finally like, oh, baby, all my critics are hateful.
Oh, baby, that must be it.
That must be it.
Yeah, you know, so it's really hard on that.
And the puns are not interesting in the slightest.
Like, we meet Poe's friend that he used to know, who is a Power Ranger.
Don't tell me she's not a Power Ranger because she's a Power Ranger.
Joe, it's not that funny.
I'm sorry.
It's not that funny.
It was like, it was like, at the beginning.
And now you've repeated it.
I think the joke would work if it was joke moving on.
And so we can go, but instead, he was like,
gotta make sure you guys heard my joke.
I'm gonna repeat it.
You're like, oh.
The more I say Power Ranger, the more likes I get.
It's a correlation.
But Nazis don't like these jokes or chuds.
Well, Nazis hate Power Rangers.
Imagine Nazi chuds, man.
That's where it's at the lowest.
No, I'll rephrase that.
They only like the white power.
Yeah, it's true.
It's the coolest one.
Yeah, I did it.
And this Power Ranger is not an interesting character,
but they spend a lot of time.
Well, you just hate women.
You just, no, no, you just hate women.
You just hate women.
I'm gonna take a crazy route here.
Here I go.
I thought she was interesting.
Well, yeah, she's all right.
She couldn't have been.
I think the very, very short amount of time she was on screen.
I was like, okay.
So she's like this gang leader spice runner outfit
that stays under the radar of the Empire on this planet
while also trying to make a living, I guess.
And she's seems pretty ruthless.
I didn't like the whole like, gets beaten up by person.
She's trying to take the ransom off and then goes,
I like you.
Yeah.
Okay.
I wanted to ask, did she show up in part seven or eight?
No, she's brand new.
Totally new.
I thought so.
That was all of her screen time was in that film.
And yeah, like I'm not, you know, being genuinely honest.
This is my honest take.
I think he hates it because she's a woman.
Like, can we really explain it in any other way?
Is there actually another I can't think so.
I think she was an amazing character.
If anything, a main character.
I hope that she gets her own series.
Yes.
I hope that we get a story blisses.
And conversely, I hope Quentin gets help because he's clearly unable
to appreciate female characters.
And that's that's a shame because I'm kind of a Nazi.
If I'm going to be honest, going to place two facts on the table
for you guys.
Okay.
He hates this film.
This film was a female protagonist.
Oh, well, if that's not a that's proof right there.
And if anyone knows putting it's Quentin correlation is causation in this.
Yes, like that's what they that's what Einstein said, right?
Got him.
The correlation is the causation.
Go get him Twitter.
We're supposed to be excited whenever she shows up on screen.
And this is especially not interesting under the context of remembering
that these are supposed to be scenes with Rose.
What did he say exactly?
He's saying that every time we see her, it's supposed to have been Rose.
That's why he's upset.
I will play that again.
I will play that again.
This character is not an interesting character, but they spend a lot of time developing her
and we're supposed to be excited whenever she shows up on screen.
This is especially not interesting under the context of remembering
that these are supposed to be scenes with Rose.
These aren't supposed to be.
What do you mean?
You're all made so that Rose wouldn't have to be.
Yeah, every time I see Rose on character, I feel like you could just
swap her out with Danny DeVito and like nothing would be lost.
Like I just see this short frumpy, chubby little short person
occasionally just being like, I captain.
And it's like, what are we gaining from you like being here with us?
It's like, who the fuck are you?
Why are you here?
We just let it start last.
I guess we know anyone.
I just like, imagine being friends with him and you're like,
yeah, the weird force healing thing.
So we're like, yeah, yeah.
Oh, this, this thing, this thing.
And he goes, yeah.
All those scenes with Zori Bliss when they were supposed to be roses
and she took them from her.
And you're like,
Well, listen, Quentin, Kelly is not going to fuck you, dude.
Like, I don't like.
He wants to clap those Asian cheeks, man.
Yeah.
Not hers.
Oh my God.
Quentin does.
I don't know.
He's got a sex doll rags.
He's taken it from any location.
I don't know.
Yeah, boy.
He's taken it from any location.
In that sentence, a free will opportunity boner.
Film also introduces a woman named genre who helps
toward the main characters around so they can find the Horcrux.
I mean, Holocron, I mean, the the set thing, the set thing.
That was a joke.
Was he trying to be funny?
Yeah.
Oh, my.
No.
Horcrux says those are from Harry Potter, right?
I was going to say, like, if it was a mistake,
you would have just edited it right.
So that was a joke.
No, but the delivery is so bad, though.
Like, you could have made it in a funny way.
If he would have just said Horcruxes and kept going, it would have been funnier.
I agree with that.
Yeah, yeah.
So introduces a woman named genre who helps toward the main characters around
so they can find the Horcrux.
I mean, Holocron, I mean, the set thing, the set thing.
A lot of people have argued that genre exists exclusively to replace Rose
because JJ just didn't want to put her in the movie.
And this is definitely true.
There's a lot of moments in the movie that could have just been Rose.
Definitely true.
Definitely true that a local of this distant planet could have been Rose.
How would it have been Rose?
Like, that would have...
No, this is where all the Asians are from, the Asian planet.
But she's...
Also, I have a very important question for our boy, E.R.
What do you think of Asian woman?
And would you hit, would you tap Asian woman?
Asian Star Wars woman?
Question mark?
You have to add another question.
I agree.
Moving on.
Fucking xenophobe.
Yeah, I was going to say, like, is it a coincidence
that he remains silent on that question?
I don't think so.
Yeah, a little suspicious.
I'm just saying.
At one point, he doesn't want to say no, because he doesn't want to, you know,
there might be a lot of Asian ladies who are interested who are listening right now.
And he doesn't want to stay on the market, you know?
Strategic.
It's like Quentin is shitting on every attractive...
These chicks wouldn't come near my dick
if it was made out of chocolate.
He licked the chocolate off of his dick years.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
I don't know why, but when you said that,
I just got, like, a terrible image of Quentin with, like,
chocolate on his nipples, just, like, rubbing it in, like, looking right in the corner.
Oh, no.
I know what that says about me, but I just wanted to make you all uncomfortable
with what my subconscious did to me.
I shouldn't have said a goddamn thing.
Now I'm thinking about Dick Chocolate, Quentin.
I'm thinking about him with his big chocolate.
Dick Chocolate sounds like a character name, like a really bad one.
Dick Chocolate.
And he looks disgusted with that right now.
Every moment that Zuri Bliss was on the screen was a moment that Dick Chocolate...
If this were a meeting, you put it in another context.
You sound like a crazy person.
Like, hopefully, he would see that.
Like, if we were like, oh, I hated TLJ, every time we saw Rose Tico,
that could have been a scene for fucking...
Dexter Jetstick.
He's still alive.
He's still running his bar.
Oh, my God.
You're a crazy person, Quentin.
Does he realize how stupid the statement is that he said the person who lives specifically on the
planet with knowledge specifically for that planet should have been Rose.
I was going to say, it doesn't make sense that that would be Rose.
It would be weird.
Yeah, well, yeah.
It's like, what the fuck?
That she takes up.
But it's also, to me, an undeniable fact that Shana and her friends are introduced
because the filmmakers were too spineless to just use Ewoks.
What the fuck?
What?
It's not the same planet.
Spineless?
You spineless piece of shit.
Just use Ewoks?
As if black people in Ewoks are interchangeable.
What?
Oh, my God.
That is fucked up.
Oh, my God.
Quentin thinks that black people in Ewoks are interchangeable.
Picture you're like, you see the black person's like, what about Ewok?
Oh, my God.
Quentin.
Quentin reviews.
Jesus.
He's become against the sword of the straw.
See, this is what I hate the most.
It's so insidious.
The way he hides his subtle bigotry in between these lines.
Disgusting.
Wouldn't you agree, Rags?
This subtle bigotry is just disgusting.
This is insane.
I can't believe it.
I have a dog whistle.
Oh, absolutely a dog.
I've got...
There are Chuds in the chat who are getting erect, I think.
Chuds in the chat.
Yeah.
Wait, wait.
Also, wasn't he against nostalgia?
And why now is he like, where do Ewoks at?
It's like, what's up?
What's up?
It's a girl.
It's a girl.
Where do Ewoks at, man?
Where do Ewoks at?
Most probably his decision was to refuse pogs at Ewok.
Instead using black people.
Black people, Ewoks.
Basically the same thing.
Oh, my God.
Quentin, that's terrible.
How could you?
Yeah, Quentin, phrasing.
From the Chuds, but from you.
Oh, my God.
See, this movie was great because it pisses off Nazis like Quentin reviews.
Because we're very mad right now.
We're definitely not laughing.
That she takes up.
But it's also, to me, an undeniable fact that Shana and her friends are introduced
because the filmmakers were too spineless to just use Ewoks.
I want to mention that the...
Wait, notice that the Ewoks have nigger lips.
Run that back, run that back.
They got the nigger lips.
Oh, my God.
They're living in huts in the woods.
Oh, my God.
No, Quentin, no.
This isn't what you were supposed to say.
Quentin, edit it out.
Edit it out, dude.
Oh, my goodness, Quentin.
That's a terrible thing for you to say.
Oh, my goodness.
And I was about to say...
Go ahead.
I was just going to say, Jay Long, on behalf of all black people,
I really take on the range that you're used to.
I would appreciate if you would never say that around me again.
Thank you.
Yes, Chase is the blackest of names.
Yeah, I'm like a 16th black.
So if you could stop that, like, I'll talk to Twitter
and I'll fucking have him do some shit.
So thanks.
He was bitching earlier in this video about how the videos...
About how these movies were just copies of the old ones.
And he's wanting Ewoks in the third installment of this one.
I'm like, what do you want, Quentin?
It's just episode six, but bigger-er.
Just an amalgamation of all the opinions he read on Twitter.
Yeah, it's like, come on, man.
That's why he turned into a terrible, horrible racist.
Because there's not a principle behind anything that's being said.
Speaking of The Office, because I've been watching it recently.
Oh my god, Quentin, no!
Oh no, Quentin!
Quentin, stop.
It's supposed to be like this.
Oh no.
This is beautiful and horrifying at the same time.
Yes, give it a second.
It's like a fever dream in real life, in real time.
I don't like to platform Nazis, but I guess we will continue with this video.
I'm so sorry for all parties offended by his rhetoric.
Oh, no.
Disgusting rhetoric.
It's fucking deplorable.
It feels like a massive step backwards.
I know that's something a lot of you choose not to care about,
but it's something I feel like I have to bring out.
It feels really awkward how the film skirts around acknowledging or expanding
on the romantic pairings in the last two movies,
where the black male lead was matched with...
Black female leads.
And I know it's awkward to say it that bluntly,
but the only reason I'm doing that is because that was an element
of the last two movies that the films gained massive praise for,
because movies...
By people like you.
People don't...
Real people don't give a fucking shit.
No one gives a shit except you people.
You always call attention to it.
You act like it's a huge deal.
Normal people don't fucking care what color you are.
You just don't give a shit.
Wow, Rags said you people.
What's up, dude?
Again...
No, it's okay. I'm into whites.
Okay, good.
Like, again, that scenario where you're a friend of his
and you're talking and you're like,
you know, it was weird that you had sort of thin...
He had an interest in races about the whole boyfriend thing in TFA,
and then he hugs her like he's missed his long life friend at the end of TLJ.
And it's like, hmm.
Then you've got that Poe and her, when they first meet at TLJ,
they get a bit of a smirky thing going on.
You're like, oh, is the film trying to say
there might be something going on there?
I don't know.
Then you've got Rose kisses Finn.
That's never acknowledged.
And then you've got the whole like,
I need to tell you something, Ray, before I die.
And you're like, oh, what's going on there?
And then, but there's lots of these things,
you know, like, is there any, like, what's going on there?
Why did none of those things do anything?
Why would they have like weird snippets?
I don't know, just, and I'd like to ask Jay to that.
And then you've got him sitting there and he's like,
yeah, I'm the fact that Finn was black.
You're like, wait, what?
He's like, well, that changes all of it, doesn't it?
He's black and he's not getting poo and tag.
You're like, what the fuck are you talking about?
You don't want that poon.
You don't want that rose tea.
It's strictly from a story perspective.
You're just like, it's kind of weird
that you have these little, little stakes of the story
where things are happening.
I'm safe.
I'm saving what I love for marriage.
He's such a, like, in the mind of people like this,
like, how do you even watch movies?
Is it possible?
You just see the colors, you know?
Specifically, like, there is black character.
Will black character be with Asian character?
I don't know.
Tune in next week to see fate of black character.
Also buy a black character action figure.
Now with one of my similar black.
Will they make a nice steaming hot plate
of ching chong chitlins?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Probably not.
You can't be associated with this racist person.
Oh my god.
I mean, Quentin reviews?
I mean, he's not usually this racist.
Quentin is, oh, Quentin is off the charts.
He really let it go in this video.
He was like, you know what?
Enough is enough.
This is, yeah, this is why you got to catch it early.
The white supremacists are, he said they hate him,
but I don't know.
I think they get along really well.
That up to that point.
And it deserves that praise.
And it feels weird that the film is just like,
yeah, we would prefer you figure it out.
Oh my god.
Also, there's a moment towards the end of the film
where two female resistance members kiss.
This is the first onscreen gay moment in a Star Wars film.
This was heavily advertised.
And I feel like the filmmakers expect praise for this,
but they do not deserve it.
How come they deserve praise for one LGBT
number alphabet people thing, but not the other?
Like, don't they get praise for that?
Or do they not?
We'll see.
What do they get praise for?
What are the rules?
I hope you'll tell us the rules.
Well, yeah, let's see what his take is first, I guess.
Slightest.
I feel the same way about this that I did the gay character
in the end game whose gayness was limited to the extent
that it could be removed in foreign dubs.
Dear filmmakers of Hollywood, you will get praise
for representation when you introduce queer characters
who aren't so intentionally minor.
But that's how sexuality should kind of be.
Unless your story is specifically about their relationship
with men or women or whatever.
It's like my sexuality is not in any way like a defining
characteristic of who I am.
What some people have said is if they had made
Finn and Poe gay and that came up in the movie at certain
points or whatever, that would have been okay because,
or celebratory because you can't cut that out
of a theoretical release in a place that hates gay people.
And that's, I think, what he's getting at.
He's like, you need to commit instead of being cowardly
about it.
I'm just at the point where I'm like.
I agree to a degree.
Like it's super spineless for groups like Blizzard
and Disney to be like, oh yeah, we're super inclusive
and we love the gays and stuff like that.
Except in China where we're not going to make as much money
if we actually commit to the things that we said.
So let's just say at the beginning of The Rise of Skywalker,
they get out of their dangerous situation.
And then they almost partially bait the race.
Still might be interested in Finn,
but then they have Finn be like, I'm so glad we made it
and he hugs Poe.
And then they actually kiss.
I would just be like, wow, I don't even know you guys
fucking knew each other.
It's got nothing to do with them being gay.
I'd just be like, these characters just don't know
each other well enough for anyone to be
romantically involved in that TIE fighter.
And I live somehow.
I just couldn't get you out of my mind.
And so I wanted me a big black stormtrooper hero
to whisk me away.
And so the whole like, the gay isn't implemented
well enough in this film.
I just be like, I don't think there was room
for any relationships, even if it was Rey and Finn.
I'd be like, that's still, so I'm just like, what?
I got to invest, but in Rey and Finn,
they haven't seen each other properly since the first one.
Yeah, y'all were too busy chasing daggers.
And that's, well, as you highlighted,
it looks like we're dealing with a story that just
doesn't have room for the romantic portion
of the human experience.
It's dealing with other things, I'm afraid.
And so it's like, you pieces of shit,
not having an overt lesbian or gay kiss.
I should be like, I'm...
We ain't got time for that.
Ain't nobody got time for that.
And I fell the same way about the one they showed.
I was like, who the fuck are they?
Like, I guess the rebels and they're happy.
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I would be happy, I guess, if I was a rebel.
And then the fact that they cut it out of other visions
to make sure they don't piss a bunch of people off.
It's like, wow, that is pretty cowardly.
Standing in brave.
Enjoy your corporate alphabet people moment.
There are characters who aren't so intentionally minor
that they can be edited out for foreign audiences.
The bare minimum is never something that...
Call the Chinese racist, do it, Quentin.
You know you want to call the Chinese racist.
Call the Chinese bigots.
Do it.
You won't because the Chinese are Asian.
And they don't, they're good, you like them.
Yeah, I know you won't do it, but you know it's true.
Because they fucking are.
But, oh, I want you to say it.
It's like that would be Rags monthly thrust.
That's what he needs.
That would be my...
I just want to hear Quentin admit that the Chinese
are fucking bigoted and racist to shit.
This implies that it should be normalized for Hollywood
to constantly tote the will of bigoted nations overseas.
Oh, he didn't say the Chinese.
He didn't say the Chinese.
He said bigoted nations.
That's something, right?
That's a that's a half thrust.
We're getting there.
We're getting there.
Half, half massed.
Rags is half massed, half massed.
To respond to like fandom nitpicks about moments
in The Last Jedi that were really prevalent
in like the six months after it came out,
but have sort of faded now.
Right.
And I can certainly say that.
That's because we've accepted them.
It's old news.
Oh, and Plague Creation said I saw that as a celebratory kiss,
not a lesbian kiss.
Um, oh, yeah, I did too.
I was just like, oh, there's the whole like,
I'd seen the marketing thing that apparently
there was supposed to be an LGBT moment in the film.
But I remember being like, okay.
Oh, is that it?
And that's the thing toward the end of the film.
I was like, where was that moment then?
And then I saw those two kiss.
I was like, oh, okay.
Right at the end.
That was it, I guess.
Snuck it in right at the end there.
Just just two gals kissing.
Just dab a little victory smooch.
And so, but this is the thing.
It's being discussed as a this was supposed to be the
progressive moment of the film, I guess.
But it's just like, I don't know that that's it.
The whole situation is bizarre.
Like, why wouldn't if JJ was so obsessed with it,
you would have thought you would have a just a gay character.
But then again, I don't know if there's everything's a mess
in terms of this storyline.
Like, if you can't imagine not being obsessed about race and gender,
that's their life.
That's the universe to them.
It's race and gender.
Oh, and sexuality, of course.
These are the most important things or 20 years.
People won't care about those moments.
So it's you don't care about them now.
You are.
You people are the ones who care about them.
Normal people don't give a shit.
You're the ones who were kept who keep obsessing about it.
They're like, yeah, lesbians kiss lesbians.
That's what they do weirdo.
No one cares.
If anything, guys love lesbians kissing.
Hmm.
This is where this whole conversation is just odd.
I'm like, why is why is stowals?
Is it just because it's mainstream?
Like, it's a big movie.
That's it.
Yeah, I guess.
So it's going to be weird to try and explain, like, certain aspects of
you're not going to have children to like, sit down and be like,
yeah, a bunch of people on Reddit got mad.
They monopolized the conversation.
Then people started making 48 hours.
They're going to be like, oh, man, quit rambling again.
Fucking understand.
I'm not your son, sir.
Sir, this is like,
there's a crazy old man on the park bench out there talking to me about
Star Wars movies, whatever Star Wars is.
Those Nazi chuds on Reddit, they ruined everything.
God damn it.
Did you take your pills, Mr.
Quinton?
My name is not Mr.
Quinton, but that's what everybody calls him.
Exclusively to appeal to those people and those people also hated it.
Maybe when I show Star Wars to my kids, I'll be like, yeah,
the weird thing about the trilogy is it's just two movies.
Isn't that strange?
I don't know why they called it a trilogy.
So here's a question.
Yeah, but Google will probably be a thing.
And well, you know, oh, man.
Also, why would you have any emotion?
If you're going to go that far, just be like, yeah, the sequels don't exist.
Wouldn't you spare them that pain, Quinton?
Come on.
Question.
When episode nine finally reveals all of the secrets inside these mystery boxes,
are any of these reveals satisfying to anyone?
Were you guys really that gratified to finally see the Knights of Ren, like this group?
No, TLJ killed all of it.
TLJ killed all of it.
All of the interests I had, TLJ fucking massacred it.
I was like, if there could be any, like, development or explanation of any of the
elements that were mysterious about TFA.
I was out by the end of TLJ.
I was like, well, it's all a joke now.
None of it would actually have anything in terms of substance behind it.
So rip.
I'm going to quote Rich Evans.
TLJ was a huge waste of time because it really, it really should have built up
elements that could have led to the third movie.
And it could, JJ refused to use what could have been used in the second movie, I guess.
I don't understand why he can't see that the problem with why Rise of Skywalker is
as damaged as it is.
It's because of the second movie.
It's like he's trying to have his cake and eat it too.
It's like, dude, Rise of Skywalker was so damaged by the second movie.
So apparently he said some about 48 hour reviews at one point.
We went over and I'm offended.
We do 12 hour reviews.
That's you, bro.
Yes.
12 hour review.
Get it right.
Fucking hell.
That's you, bro.
He's mad that when we do these videos, these videos that have minimal editing,
like them and enjoy them.
Hey, man.
When he makes videos with pictures up on the screen, how could you?
Yeah, I zoomed into them.
Yeah, that's true.
He sure did.
Racks.
So we can see more of his face.
I'd like to think we're funny.
That's why this is entertaining.
No.
Oh, no, no.
We're evil racists.
We're pandering.
The only reason we're making money is because we're getting that white supremacist dollar.
Look at those.
Look at those super chuds in the.
That must be the only reason.
I mean, the most virtuous Quinton reviews.
He's not making as much or fucking something.
He's bitching about his money and it's obviously the white supremacist.
Yeah, he did highlight that he lost his he lost a portion of income
because he stood against Nazism.
How about you guys have the courage to do that?
That's what I welcome.
I would I welcome the ability for me to grow rich as white supremacists get poorer.
Well, that's racist.
Probably.
All right.
Yeah, it's probably.
Yeah, I mean, I'm going to give my money back.
That'll show him in all black standing around doing nothing
like they're trying to audition for Organization 13.
Did Ray finding out who her grandfather is really cause her to do anything
other than go on an arc she already did in the last film?
Did we gain some the idea that yeah, I agree.
You got palpitism being her grandfather.
And what we saw in the film was like the only result of it.
It's like, no, I could have done all kinds of things.
They didn't really do it.
It would have been a real, a real existential moment for for Ray.
He really could have been bothered by that in a very personal, meaningful way.
But she's Ray and she's just the best hate mongers of the toxic church.
Emotions mean nothing to our goddess.
It's my damn, my damn Ray.
Something by learning that Snoke was a clone created by Palpatine.
What was the thing that we gained?
Okay, so claiming that.
Okay, so we should have had a satisfying explanation for why Snoke was.
I was going to say, like, why do you think we wanted that?
Because I'm assuming he's addressing the people who like were gunning for a Snoke explanation.
That's not an explanation on its own.
He was created in a lab.
You're like, right.
So I've got a few more thousand questions.
It's like, nope, that's it.
That's like nothing.
By who? For what reason?
And how would you make something that powerful from a fucking test tube?
Why didn't you make more of them?
If that's the case, why did you not?
Why are you not creating a army?
A billion Snokes and put them into your million Death Star Star destroyers
and just send them out there.
You've basically dominated the universe.
This is weird.
It is very weird.
And this is the thing, we didn't get like the idea that it's like,
what did you even gain by that having that explanation?
Like, well, it wasn't really an explanation.
Yeah, it was a shitty attempt at an explanation.
Our wanting an explanation wasn't the issue.
It's the fact that we got a crappy one that makes like no sense.
Yeah, it raises more questions.
Also, I don't think that episode nine is like episode six, but bigger.
I think it's episode five and six in one movie.
And it doesn't make sense because they.
I mean, the whole chasing multiple McGuffins thing.
I don't think Star Wars has done that before.
No, I mean, it broke new ground.
Like, I think it's a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.
It's more like there was this reveal that race of Palpatine, Palpatine, right?
And I think that could have been like this first movie.
And now she resolves that with the more empire and return,
but they tried to cram it in one movie.
They definitely like it was a bad.
It's so bad.
It felt it definitely felt like this is what all the pacing comments have been about.
It's just it was just breakneck speeds of next thing, next thing, next thing.
It's just like, whoa, I got something for you.
I got a friend.
Who just did this?
My dog reacts to giant cockroach user XB TFR.
Which one is that?
Because I'm I'm I'm oh, well.
Wait, I mean, anything to escape.
That's basically this stream is a dog reacting to a giant cockroach.
So it seems fairly accurate, I suppose.
You see, it's a metaphor.
We are the dog reacting to the cockroach of Quentin reviews.
Remember when we ran Spies together?
Oh, is this I think is everyone at the right place?
I guess we are.
It's all black standing around.
A twenty to thirty eight.
They're trying to audition for organization.
Thirteen.
What's organizations?
I think it's a Kingdom Hearts joke.
I think I think I wouldn't know.
Because I'm not a nerd.
I got to be racist, bro.
Nerds are nerd is a racist.
Yeah, we are the most prejudiced race on the planet.
Cameras rise up.
Gamers rise up.
Nega that quality.
That is a good one.
Quentin thinking that he walks and black people are interchangeable.
I'm telling you, man, we've seen a lot of spicy ass fucking takes.
But man, that's that's one of the best.
Just I don't know what possessed you quits.
I don't know what it was.
That was great.
Finding out who her grandfather is really caused her to do anything other than go on an arc.
She already did in the last film.
Did we gain something by learning that Snoke was a clone created by Palpatine?
What was the thing that we can can I comment on one thing?
Like, I think we could have had a more.
What was race art in the second movie?
She discovered like rag said, right?
She discovered her parents and nobody in that she needs to choose her own destiny.
Like she did in the first film.
Like she did in the third film.
And in the third film, parents are bad.
Grandparents was a bad.
I got this.
It's all in my video.
The first one is it doesn't matter who your parents are because they're gone.
The second one is, no, your parents do matter, but they're nobodies.
So, hey, take that for what you will.
And then the third one's like, no, it's not that they don't matter.
And it's not that they're nobodies.
They do matter.
They are Palpatine.
Now you need to choose if you're going to follow the footsteps of Palpatine or not.
It's like, dude, this trilogy does not get along with itself.
It's like it's it's like a bunch.
It's like different people alternate alternated installments in the trilogy.
And they hated each other or something weird that I get that impression.
But yeah, by the end, the parents still didn't matter
because she didn't fucking acknowledge her lineage any goddamn way.
We didn't even like the idea that she was given a choice between Palpatine and Skywalker
is like, that never really happened.
It's not like we ever thought she was going to turn to the dark side.
They didn't.
They didn't try.
That was bullshit.
They had her doing some weird things like she kept walking off on her own
and she had that moment of lightning.
And she saw a dark ray with Bilbo teeth.
And you're just like, why why any of this?
Hey, when she fucking zapped Chewie.
What is shit?
It was really funny.
And I don't think they wanted it to be that way, but it was like, what the fuck?
It's weird that they had Chewie getting zapped by Ray when that could be a moment
where Rose Tico is in it.
I mean.
She could have done her magic samurai power.
God, that's true.
Okay, so claiming that this movie is just episode six, but bigger as a little inaccurate
because it ignores.
Has anyone said that actually does finally get saying it right.
Free backstory.
After her birth, Palpatine discovered Ray's existence and for saw that she could.
Fuck you.
Well, how does it like the horror cruxes, we got the Harry Potter music, like read another book.
Holy shit.
No reaction was foreshadowing.
Unironically, though, the story that JJ was trying to explain was the Palpatine wanted
her to becomes his successor, not his own kid, because his own kids was like, no, I
want to be a good tism.
And he was like, okay, fine, I'll take your grandchild.
And then she was like, no, I'm running.
No, I'm running.
We're running away.
Who?
And then he was like, that's who I'm sending.
Dr.
She after you.
Dr.
She's like, motherfucker.
I'm stabbing my knife.
And then they're like, okay, we'll sell our daughter to a car plot.
Because that's the best decision.
Yeah.
It's like, hey, we're going to sell you and we can go.
We sold it for drinking, buddy.
It's like, wait, Kylo, you said you did lie.
Was that just, I think we talked about the stream.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you're thinking I'm going to sell the kid anyway.
So why not get some drinking, buddy?
I mean, where's the loss?
Yeah.
And then Uchi killed him anyway.
Damn.
Damn.
Indeed.
Oh, wait.
Wait, this.
It's a good you need to rejoin because you're my exact enough.
Okay, wait, wait.
I don't think that's a rejoin thing.
That's more of a because he's he doesn't sound tismy.
He just sounds like he's disconnecting it.
Like we need to go to Singapore maybe.
Wait, I'll try something like these.
I'm going to take us to Singapore anyway.
Do do do do do.
Is it better now?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Is it better?
No.
Oh, it's to be.
Oh, it's better for me.
Singapore.
I'm connected to Singapore.
Exactly.
We're helping you.
I have a thank you, Singapore.
Wait, this this this the Uchi know how to get to Exegul.
Yes, because apparently he was sent from Exegul.
Right.
I think it was my property.
Right.
I mean, he must know how to get to Exegul because he's got a knife that he can translate that
takes him to a key that can get you to Exegul.
Right.
Is it like that?
Maybe Ochi couldn't read.
Sif.
Oh, no.
Yeah, but no, but which would be weird.
But fuck it.
Who knows?
So one of Ray's parents is Palpatine's kid, right?
Why doesn't he just use the parent to become super, super powerful?
And because they're just nobodies, I guess.
Yeah.
How does how does Ray's not Palpatine's daughter slash son get defeated by a man with a knife
when they have force powers?
Unless the force.
He was drunk.
After all, he was drunk, smaller drinking.
He drank the body.
He was too drunk to fight against Ochi, but her parents protected her.
And for that, they were killed, too.
It's not a Harry Potter thing.
Are you are you so retarded?
You think Harry Potter came up with that shit like parents dying to save their child?
Like, yeah, JK Rowling came up with that astonishing act of bravery.
No rags, it's because it.
You mentioned earlier that you should read something other than Harry Potter, right?
And well, I mean, there was a there was a there was a art.
You got it.
Do you guys know the movie Quickly Down Under?
No, no.
There's a character in that whose arc in that film is basically this.
And that movie had, like, God, who's who's that quick?
Let's hear that.
That was 1990.
That was God, what's his fate?
Tom Selleck was in that.
Alan Rickman was in that.
He was the bad guy in Quickly Down Under.
What a great film.
I love that.
Well, the point is that one of the characters, their arc was basically like the idea
that she would put herself in a risk to save like a child figure.
It's great, but go watch it.
It just showed up.
If no one knows the film, though, then it doesn't really count because I have to sit here explaining it.
Alan Rickman.
The point is, if he's broad enough, he can make it sound like this film completely rips off Harry Potter,
even though there's so many details to that that are so disingenuous.
But, hey, it makes for he gets to zoom in on his face slowly destroyed.
But for years before this, he had planned for contingencies in case this did occur.
And so in the years after his death, his secret followers gathered the materials to resurrect him.
This is fucking Harry Potter.
No, it isn't.
You're a fucking stupid.
You're an idiot.
It's the only book that you've ever read that's like all of your fucking buddies.
The only goddamn book you people have ever read and can reference is Harry fucking Potter.
Does he think it's a Horcrux?
Is that what he's about to say?
He he he was deliberately broad.
This is retarded.
Like, I'm sorry, Quentin.
You know, this is retarded.
Gather the materials to resurrect is like, no, he's just on a life support machine.
Yeah, that's not the same as Horcruxes at all.
Wait, I made I typed some notes when I was in the when I was in the film.
And and all they say about Palpatine being alive, somehow Palpatine is alive.
That's all they say about that.
Yeah, he's like, yeah, yeah.
And the wayfinders, you cannot compare them to Horcruxes whatsoever.
Yes, there's no connection.
Oh, they're an item of interest.
Oh, OK.
If you have an item of interest, you're like Harry Potter.
So that works now.
You know, the ring fucking Harry Potter rip off of Horcrux?
Because the ring is a rip off of Lord of the Rings.
Lord of the Rings is a rip off of Harry Potter, though.
Came way after.
That's why the alternative title of the ring was the Ring Queen.
Wait, does he explain his analogy as to why this is Harry?
No, I think he will.
I don't know, but he's already made his point, right?
He thinks he's made his point.
That is the main plot to the Harry Potter film.
No, it's not.
What's wrong with you?
Like having a stroke over not a real thing.
This is like when Jenny Nichols just started piecing together
like her own lore for Joker about like medication.
And he started fucking spiraling down her own train of logic.
And you're like, no.
Is this film trying to say you shouldn't take medication?
It's OK, Jimmy.
It's OK.
Oh, God.
Quinton's eyes are completely dead.
Do yes.
That's like a fish like cold.
It sounds like he has some emotion here.
Yeah, he's he's getting this passion.
Yeah, he's getting worked up.
Franchise, are you trying to come into my house
and superglue your broken ass franchise together with a more broken ass friend?
Is this supposed to be funny?
I'm sorry.
Most well, we're also like that he has the shitty acoustics.
So it sounds like he's just fucking ranting in like the in like the movie theater house.
Fucking toilet.
Just a closet.
Oh, like this is that this all takes place in a stall.
Like it like the handicap stall.
It's extra big.
He had to bring this stuff inside.
Then everyone's going to end up flushing of other people.
Well, you need to know about this movie.
Oh, yeah, Carrie Fisher's in it.
And it's bad.
So what JJ Abrams ended up doing was he took deleted scenes from The Force Awakens
and he cut Carrie Fisher's head off and gimp and he pasted it over a body double.
So every moment with her in this movie is written around unused dialogue.
Scenes in episode seven that were too boring to put in.
It never once feels like Carrie Fisher is actually there.
It feels like I agree.
It's these out of context clips being edited into these terrible scenes written around the
clips with no good pacing as the actors stare at the face of a woman who is not Carrie Fisher
and pretend that they are talking to their dead friend.
It might be insensitive to put it this way, but the performance.
You think he walks you're capable with black people.
We've passed that point a long time ago, Quentin.
That pun was the funniest he's been.
I was about to say, he just said it may be insensitive to put it this way,
but the performance was lifeless.
Also, did any of you guys laugh?
Did any of you guys laugh when Ray got all of the, you know, the Jedi powers and resurrected
herself and then Leia's body just fucking collapsed in the sheets and and wrinkle McTits
just kind of nodded approvingly.
Well, I didn't know what to stand.
I was like, wait, she could only disappear.
Is she like a poltergeist right now?
Like her business needs to be done.
Just like a magician, like a post-mortem magician.
I'm free.
Finally, I can go have a moment with Luke and my fucking husband.
Ex-husband, a strange husband, deadbeat dad.
I don't know.
I don't even, we don't even know if Hans a force ghost or not.
He's a memery, obviously.
He is a memery.
It's creepy and uncomfortable, and it made me uneasy.
Of course, the only thing he was uncomfortable with was with a woman.
Okay, Quentin.
Of course, it's just like Quentin.
This leaves the scene where Leia eventually looks kind of vaguely sad and she wanders off,
and the Ma's character from episode seven turns to a random person and goes like,
Leia's about to use up the last of her energy to save her son.
She only gets her son killed.
That's the story for another time.
That's a good point, though.
That's a good point, though.
Oh, well, no, yeah, he's right.
It's really awkward exposition.
It's like, who the fuck asked you, orange midget?
And how does she know also?
Yeah, it's like...
Ma's, you're literally here as a diversity hire for Disney.
I just need you to understand this.
Such an interesting character.
And we need more rotten oranges.
Fascinating.
How do you know that?
And then Leia's body double dies in a bed and all the characters get sad.
This triggers Kylo Ren to reevaluate all the choices.
There weren't choices so much as he was clearly tricked, though, and he takes this just fine.
Also, this is not the first time that he has reevaluated his position in the will.
He does it a lot.
Like in free movies.
I feel like if he survived this movie that he would have, like, in a year's time been like,
you know, Darkseid isn't so bad.
And everyone's like, Kylo, like, seriously, dude.
Carlos.
At this moment, he allows Ben Solo to be reborn and Kylo Ren-
Is that what he allows?
I guess you could put it that way.
I don't really know.
They treat that throughout the films.
They do treat it as though they're two different characters inhabiting the same body.
And what they really mean is that it's Ben Solo the whole time,
and he's just choosing whether or not he wants to be an asshole.
That's it.
Man, I bet the war crimes tribunal is going to love that defense.
The rebellion and ring figure of what Palpatine is,
they all arrive to try and fight-
The Republic is useless anyways, they probably won't care.
And then Palpatine opens the ceiling of his cave to show Rey,
all of her friends almost dying at the hands of the final order.
And he says, you have to kill me, strike me down, become a Sith, take my throne.
And this is clearly supposed to be-
Then she should immediately do it and say, call off the attack.
I was going to say, you can call it like a ripoff or whatever of episode six,
but it's weirder because he explains it mechanically like it happens this way.
You kill me, I get to inhabit your body.
It's like, oh.
Yeah, these are the rules.
I guess.
And if the rules work like that and always have worked like that,
then why is it the Palpatine didn't jump into Attica or Luke
when he was thrown down the fucking hole?
I guess because he didn't die.
He was still in his body, floating in space, like.
He's like, damn it, I would have thought that killed me.
I clearly miscalculated my own fucking constitution.
There was this tweet that said, of Emperor.
She says, kill me and you'll absorb my power.
Then she kills him and then later on the movie, nothing happens.
I like the theory that it's Palpatine actually went into a body
and then she's just like Luke Caesar.
And then she like looks at him evilly and has like evil eyes.
And he's like, oh, fuck, like we can't.
Or if he's just if he's just a voice in her head for the rest of her life,
he's like, hey, what where are you going?
It's like, I'm going to be evil.
You son of a bitch.
Go and stab that guy over there.
Well, he's like, I feel like McDonald's.
She's like, she's like watching the newest episode of Mandalore
and he's like, do you want to like be evil, star an empire?
You're really boring, Ray.
You just sit here every day watching TV.
Oh, you would eventually just be nagging her.
He would eventually just be nagging her to like get different kinds of food.
He'd be like, I want chunky monkey tacos.
Yes, soft shell tacos.
Yes, I love them.
I taste everything.
I'd fucking love to see the entire series of Ray just possessed by him.
Every time you take it back, I can see you.
I've seen from episode six where Palpatine shows Luke,
his friends being massacred, and he says, you should try.
Oh, it's a good film.
It's good, good scenes, memories.
And get revenge on me and give him to the dark side of your emotions.
But Palpatine's appeal in this movie is an appeal to Ray's will willingness
to do good to save her friends.
So it's not so so it's missing the point of Palpatine entirely.
Like Ray killing Palpatine to save her friends would be exactly the same as Darth Vader
killing Palpatine to save his son.
I don't know how to explain this better.
Why does this matter?
It's only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
Yeah, don't think about it.
It's just lore stuff, Quentin.
Seriously, you need a countdown.
I love the fact that all of these fucking movie reviewers just sit in a room and just
talk shit like aimlessly off scripts.
And they're like, I wish I knew how to explain this better.
It's like, boy, there was a specific writing implement.
You can use the organized-
Only there was a strategy I could use to know-
A format to utilize.
...how I stay alive.
You know, the men of the cave would make markings on the walls with the paint.
You could try that.
He's like, no, that's too advanced for me.
Anyways, the point of the scene is you can't kill Hitler because that makes you Hitler.
But Hitler killed Hitler.
Yeah.
Did he stay Hitler after killing him?
Yeah, what happened then, Quentin?
Yeah.
We'll never know.
Hitler became Hitler but killing Hitler.
Hitler became Hitler.
Hitler and haven't hit the dead corpse of Hitler.
It's very-
But I was gonna sit, commit suicide.
Oh, don't even fucking go into it.
It's complicated.
It's really fucked up.
It makes my head hurt just thinking about it.
Just kill me already.
I'm trying to fight the emperor, but the emperor sucks the life force out of them
and uses this to regrow all the parts of his body and the emperor is born in this moment.
And I can't remember who made the joke.
It was like, did his penis grow back?
Was that full enough?
I don't know.
How weird would that have felt?
I need Kylo specifically for this part.
I have to suck off his penis.
I mean, because Palpatine got busy.
We know this now.
That's canon.
So I mean-
If I need to make another baby or something, I'm gonna need a penis.
He's like, that's just basic biological mechanics.
What do you want me to do?
Kylo, I need your penis.
Give it to me.
It's not like you're doing anything with it.
No, I just did a big video essay about Palpatine.
So I feel like I know how Palpatine should be written and-
Oh, don't jump to conclusions.
Yeah, you, Quentin.
You should have fucking written this whole movie.
Palpatine never reminds me of Palpatine in this movie.
He reminds me of Voldemort.
Of course he does.
Voldemort is the main actor.
Everything reminds you of Voldemort.
He acts like Voldemort.
He does Voldemort, he thinks.
That's what the film is.
So then Rey starts meditating and she asks all the Jedi of the past to speak to her.
And then we zoom into space and we hear a bunch of Jedi talk to her as a fanservicey moment.
We hear Anakin, which I think is JJ's way of still having Anakin involved in the defeat
of Palpatine, even if in a pathetically limited way.
Man, these takes being just one-to-one with-
He really cares about this lore, you know?
I didn't think about that.
Very upset, visibly.
And we hear all these voices from the cartoons, which is neat.
We also hear Ahsoka, which I feel like was a big selling point of this scene.
I don't personally agree with the diagnosis that Ahsoka is a Jedi or would have been a
Jedi at the time of her death.
Stuff like that feels like fanservice without substance,
and I feel like that's an important distinction.
Rey uses two lightsabers to reflect Palpatine's lightning back into his own face.
That's what happened.
That's pretty much what happens.
He blows his head off, and that's how he's defeated.
Rey dies, but then Ben uses the Force healing power from all the video games to heal her,
and then she comes back, and they make out in a big romantic moment,
and then he leans over and dies.
And I heard other people in the theater laughing at this,
so it wasn't just me that found this shit funny.
Because the moment that Ben Solo is redeemed, you know he has to die.
Because outside of some fan comics I read on Instagram when I pretend that no one is looking,
there is no future in the franchise where Kylo and Rey raise a family, and they have a son.
Why do people want that?
It's so weird.
Because fat, fucking 30-year-old women sit around with their drying up ovaries,
just fantasizing about fictional pairings.
Don't call me out like that, please.
You're not white, okay?
I'm clearly not talking about you.
Yeah, the people in my audience were like,
oh my god, it really hurt me.
You know how every time Red Letter Media uploads a video in this vein,
and they always have like the secret recording of Rich Evans
just giggling at stupid shit happening?
Yeah.
How happy would you be if you were at a movie theater?
I think they're in like Oklahoma Jersey, like I forget where they live.
Minnesota.
Wisconsin.
Wisconsin.
Oh yeah, yeah, Wisconsin.
How happy would you be if you went to a movie theater in Wisconsin and you just heard...
In the background, you're like, oh my god, is that B. Rich Evans?
Oh my god, it's Hollywood star Rich Evans.
Full mast.
I would search.
I'd be like, are you there?
Is this real?
Just peek around, turn on your flashlight.
And they have wholesome adventures.
Either he's dead or he's in jail.
It's those two options.
A lot of people have talked about how it's shitty
that Ray ends up having a romantic moment with this dude
who's been heinously manipulating her the whole movie,
but there's a whole other side of this scene
that I feel like no one is talking about that I really need to address.
It should have been gross.
In the end of it, in the prequels, Palpatine is Anakin's father, right?
In episode one, we're told that Anakin's mother, Shmi.
Shmi.
I just don't know.
But yeah, I'm pretty sure this is...
This is the...
I've seen a lot of people saying this, so...
Like, I haven't read the extended stuff to definitively explain the conservation.
That's a word now of Anakin, but I...
Conservation has always been a word.
I'm not saying it like that.
Conceivation.
Conception?
No.
Conceivation.
I prefer it.
Oh, that's fair enough.
So, I don't know the specifics, but yes.
I believe this is a contentious issue right now
because it's like that's gross.
That's some gross-tisms right there at Disney.
I've heard people say that apparently Disney have already put out
a comic or something that says that it was from Palpatine
that made Anakin to try and subvert the shit before it gets out of hand.
But hey.
Because the net kiss is incestuous.
Yeah, that would be really kind of weird.
Disney probably wouldn't get away from that, you know.
Disney are not huge proponents of incest, as far as I know.
I don't know for sure.
I have not looked at it.
Allegedly.
I don't know.
It depends.
Have you seen The Lion King?
I don't know how the Chinese feel about it.
Yeah, true.
Well, yeah.
Kiss him, but Nala's his sister.
But there was no father.
And this, coupled with the boy's abilities,
leads the Jedi to presume that he is the chosen one created by the Force.
Yes.
And that...
This is the thing about the whole, like, does it become genetic or is it DNA,
or just force particles?
Like, that Star Wars girl said that they imply it's definitely like...
It had Palpatine's DNA is definitely in there or whatever.
It's just like...
Pretty creepy.
Force to do good.
But in episode three, Palpatine tells Anakin about a figure named Darth Plagueis the Wise.
Plagueis?
Great life.
Plagueis, Plagueis.
Plagueis?
Plagueis?
And yeah, that's the thing, that it's actually him.
Or at least, I think that's what Disney said.
It's actually Darth Plagueis, not Palpatism.
So we're fine.
Who could use the Force to create life?
And he says that Plagueis had an apprentice who...
You know, I gotta admit, Quinn, you're talking a lot about lore,
for a guy who says the lore complaints are silly.
Very confused.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Is it...
It's kind of weird.
Kind of weird, you know.
Learn this power...
I feel like I can't get a bead on you.
...and he killed his mentor.
And everyone universally accepts that Palpatine is that apprentice,
and thus Palpatine have the power to...
I'm gonna make sure.
I'm actually concerned that the clips will probably get us
a hit on the livestream as well,
because the rules work differently for livestreaming versus videos.
You gotta be careful.
This is the subversive reveal that Anakin is not a Christ figure.
He's not the chosen one.
He's the...
I mean, I don't necessarily disagree with this.
I'm just posing him for the safety, that's all.
Before you just put the cover up, actually, that could work.
The Antichrist.
The Spawn of Satan.
And for a while, this was just a fan theory,
and one way that you could interpret these movies,
but the canon Darth Vader comics had a page which absolutely 100% revealed
that this is the only way to interpret these scenes in the prequels.
So Luke is already Palpatine's grandson,
and Kylo Ren is Palpatine's great-grandson.
Essentially, what I'm getting at is that by copying the original trilogy,
without understanding the content of the prequels,
JJ Abrams has accidentally reintroduced to Star Wars its most infamous theme.
Incest.
Leading up to The Rise of Skywalker, I believed it could be one of two things.
It could be an exploration of these characters that was a unique
stand-alone experience that you didn't need to see any other films to enjoy,
or it could be the identifying nature that combined all three trilogies into one,
all nine movies as one binge-able experience.
Maybe there would finally be an Anakin Forceco's cameo,
exploring Kylo's misguided belief that Vader would approve of his actions.
And how come Anakin never said that?
How come Anakin was like, no, that's not me, dude.
I ain't telling you that shit.
Anakin was just Palpatine.
He's back from the dead.
He's tricking you, dude.
Like, don't go down this dark path like I did.
It's just, this series, this trilogy really doesn't make any sense at all.
Some sort of cheesy over-the-top moment where you saw all three of the leads of the three trilogies
together, and they somehow helped each other defeat Palpatine for the final time.
When I heard all the negative reviews, I figured it ended up being the latter.
It was a film so obsessed with playing homage to eight previously existing films
that it really wasn't a standalone experience that you could enjoy
unless you were already a hardcore fan.
But it turns out that the film just decided to not choose,
and thus it fails exponentially at either option.
It does a bad job of exploring the arcs of Ben and Rey,
and it really doesn't do any sort of job of exploring any character-
How do you explain the audience score, then, Quentin?
You're gonna-
Yeah.
Gonna call bots.
86% of people loved it.
I mean, again, he's probably someone who thought the Russian bot thing was a real thing as well, so.
Oh, almost certainly he did.
So yeah, he probably does think it's being botted, actually.
He fucking hates Trump.
So.
Characters outside of that.
It literally forgets about whole scenes and introduces exploring those characters,
and most importantly, it seems to find its value exclusively through its comparisons
to pre-existing material in episodes four, five, and six.
It also potentially ruins the point of episodes one through six.
You can look at the Palpatine story elements in two different ways.
Either devalues his first defeat at the hands of Anakin,
and thus the entire arc of episodes one through six,
or it chooses to make its own story not important
in order to give that original arc more weight.
Either it-
How does it choose to make its own story not important?
How would you say that it does that?
It's contradictory,
or it sets itself up a premise that two things can't usually both
kind of simultaneously exist with the same meaning.
But it totally says the Palpatine was not defeated in the OT.
We defeated him, you know?
Like, we're the important ones.
We're the ones that actually put him in his grave.
And good thing we did because he wasn't, you know, the death star.
Yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty threatening, I guess.
But thousands of them, we took out the real threat.
Yep, we're the real heroes.
I don't know how you can interpret that as, like, they're saying, you know,
the one through six are the important ones.
It's like, hmm.
That kind of seems like one through six don't really matter all that much.
It ruins the very thing it's trying to play homage to,
or it tries not to matter in order to make that thing more important.
And if it does that, then it retcomes the entire sequel trilogy.
Rhett, guys, that's just fan stuff.
Well, he's clearly interpreting episodes seven and nine as sequels
to episodes one, two, three, four, five, six.
I don't know how he managed to fuck that up.
Yeah, what a weirdo.
Why would you do that?
A shitty spinoff novel series that you don't really need to read.
The worst thing about the Mystery Box format is that it staked the worth
of the entire trilogy on the finale.
And thus, because the finale turned out to be so disappointing and stupid,
it's going to be hard to go back and look at the first two movies
and try and find the same worth that we did before.
Is he referring to Force Awakens and TLJ?
Yeah, I think so.
Just skip him.
I don't even watch them either.
He loves TLJ too much.
I also disagree with his statement about the Mystery Box.
What, like that it's just a bad thing to do in general?
No, I mean, it's a bad thing to do in general,
but it's not just the Mystery Box's fault that the trilogy is bad.
I don't know that I...
I'm trying to think of an example of a...
The thing about the Mystery Box is that it's hard to remember
which ones were good, quote, unquote,
because that just means that we were explained what the mystery was
and it was satisfying, we moved on,
so we don't even associate it as a Mystery Box.
I'm trying to think of like,
what are examples of Mystery Boxes that did well?
No, it's more like, I think it's more of the ideas
that were in the Mystery Box could have been explained in...
Some other competent writer.
Yeah, I think some ideas could have been good.
Like, let's say, for instance,
like the twist was all along that Ray is a Palpatine, Palpatine, whatever.
If they built that up for...
For, like, I think that would have been an interesting mystery,
quote, unquote, like, that's what Ray was.
That's why she's powerful.
I think that would have been interesting,
but they didn't really plan that shit out, so...
Usual suspects.
That is a good example.
The whole premise of that film is that who did the...
Well, yeah, who done it are essentially Mystery Box films?
Like...
I guess what I'm getting at is, right,
if you refer to Snoke as a Mystery Box,
what you're saying is that we've been shown him,
but we don't know enough about him yet to figure out what is going on here,
what is the story here.
And I think that that's in a shit ton of stories,
just elements that don't get explained until later.
But maybe people are talking about the difference between a film
having Mystery Boxes and another film having to answer them
versus being in the same one.
Could be something.
Either way, I think you can do it well,
and I think a really good writer could have done something with TFA.
I think so too.
Like, I don't know if I'm ever going to feel like
watching The Force Awakens again,
because I feel like that movie is now defined by this movie,
and that's really depressing.
They're both depressing.
We're just on layers of depressing.
I think TLJ is probably the depressing one out of three.
It's a very, very...
Film.
Like, everything sucks.
But, um...
Um, sure.
They're all depressing.
Fine.
I'll give it to you.
That's...
That's The Rise of Skywalker.
Just a bad film.
It's probably not a great idea to make this video right now,
because this is the first time in like two years
where no one on the internet is mad at me.
Yeah.
Two years?
What do you mean?
Two years, man.
No one's...
Okay.
It was like...
You've kind of become a bit of a mean coincidence.
Yeah, the last stupid thing he said was probably like
a couple months ago at most.
What did he say then?
It's a victory.
Oh, I don't know.
It's hard to keep track.
You just have to just...
YouTube, Quinton is a fucking idiot,
and then you'll find like 10,000 videos that are like,
oh, this is...
I'm gaining subscribers at a normal rate.
And I don't know, maybe this video will kill that.
If it does, oh well.
I just want to say, if you like this movie,
that's okay.
I don't hate you for that.
And if you don't like the movie, like I do,
you should just not like the movie.
You shouldn't try and act revenge.
You shouldn't try and harass people
that do like the movie or people who are in the movie.
All right.
Okay.
You also shouldn't say that black people
are interchangeable with fucking Ewoks.
I just don't take...
I will admit.
Quinton, I appreciate you putting this
at the end of your video.
You know, guys, just because you dislike something
doesn't mean you should attack cast members.
If you do like something, that's cool.
People who dislike movies tend to just fucking harass people.
That's just...
They're demons.
Yeah, that's why you should like all things
so that you won't harass people, I guess.
So much better for your chi.
You should just have an opinion about a film.
I'm not going to make disliking this movie
a part of my personal brand.
I'm not going to start doing any of the pieces.
Of course not, because if you don't want to get
into a fight with those people,
because they'd fucking shred your ass.
I shred his ass on every topic anyway.
Of course you don't want to get into a fight
with these people.
We'll roast you.
You look like a fucking fool.
He's liking this movie a part of my personal brand.
This way, snipe it a distance.
And I'm not going to start doing hit pieces
on YouTubers who say that they do like it.
I'm not going to still be talking about this bullshit
in too many years.
You're literally talking about it, you fucking carrot.
Like, how did he not notice this?
He's like directly subtweeting you, Molly.
I was going to say, this may as well just have a title
above it being like, for the eFAB people,
this is my message to you.
You're hating on people.
You're bad.
You're bad, people.
All of you are terrible.
Here, guys, remember our brand being exclusively TLJ?
We have no Godzilla, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel,
Game of Thrones.
Just TLJ.
Just TLJ.
No more.
Fucking, and it's not just TLJ, it's hating on TLJ
to the point where we only cover people
to disagree with them and say their opinions of the evils.
We are the bad ones.
I'm sorry, Quentin.
But yeah, the eFAB brand, if you were to call it that,
it's just all media.
We've got no limits on here.
We'll even cover movies about Ewoks or, sorry,
black people, I mean, like the Black Panther,
like the Ewok movie.
It's the same.
Episode six, Roots, basically the same thing.
Yeah.
Episode six.
You're doing head pieces on YouTubers
who say that they do like it.
How is it a hit piece to just respond to your points?
I disagree with you.
That's a hit piece.
You fucking hit piece, maker.
I really hate this movie.
Oh, no, it's a hit piece.
Just to up it.
So, oh, imagine how upset he is right now.
We've just nearly completed our hit piece again.
Oh, yay.
I'm sorry.
You should have thought about it several times.
Oh, my God.
And isn't he the idiot who made like a fucking response
to someone else's review?
Well, so this is actually him saying that he's doing
like we're doing the hit piece on him.
He made a singular video that's supposed to be a parody of me.
It was the Citizen Kane one.
He took it down because nobody understood what the fuck
he was trying to achieve with that video.
It was really embarrassing.
Then you've got the video he made with TRO,
where it was a literal rags and ball of hit piece.
He lied about us.
He was absolutely lied about us.
It was like, damn, Quentin.
Like, this is, oh, this is like your defining moment
for so many people now.
How could you say this?
You're such a hypocrite.
Because I'm totally cool with people being like,
hey, you fucked up when you said this, this, this.
Oh, okay.
But he was like, rags things.
There's no objective value to a movie if it sells a toy.
It's like, what the fuck?
I'm like, what?
I was like, when did I say that?
That doesn't sound like a thing that I'd say.
Oh, my god.
Like, if you found out that was a quote from rags,
any of you, you just be like, that doesn't sound real.
He's like, that's no.
He was obviously joking.
He was obviously using the sarcasm as he does.
It's fascinating, man.
And like, the idea that he doesn't regularly just fucking
rail against the opinions of people he doesn't fucking like.
But no, he's holier than thou.
We're the ones who do it.
He's the Goodman.
Disliking this movie, a part of my personal brand,
I'm not going to start doing hit pieces on YouTubers who say that they do.
You wouldn't be very good at it.
We've already proved that anyway.
Your brand would be poo poo.
Like, I'm not going to still be talking about this bullshit in two or three years.
I'm just going to move on with my life.
You clearly didn't, though.
I have better things to do.
He says with a sex doll in the background.
I'm going to go back to my life.
I think, well, no, wait.
I think he did.
What's that guy?
Patrick Willems.
Like, he he said that that's the meaning of his like message.
Like the space children thing.
He wasn't going to obsess.
It kind of reminds me of what Patrick Willems said about Star Wars.
His joke.
Patrick Willems quote will follow him to his grave.
It's just a guy who has it printed out.
He's like, Patrick, what about this?
I need you to acknowledge.
He has a picture of it.
People don't even have to say anything.
It's it's a text image.
That's just a screenshot of him.
Like you did this, Patrick.
This is you.
You did this.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
What were you fucking thinking?
And he calls people idiots for misunderstanding his point.
It's like, I'm sorry.
We took what you said to mean what it was.
Just the words what they meant are bad.
Quinton's outro here.
He may as well just said, I'm going to go have sex with my girlfriend.
Well, you guys talk about your stupid virgin losers being angry about me.
Can't you see how fucking chat I am?
With my quirky t-shirt under my polo, my unkempt face.
My fat ass is like jealous.
You think of Quinton, my my gay frogs fucking in a conga line.
Yeah.
Do you think like when he goes on a first date, the first thing he says is like,
first of all, I immensely respect the struggle that all women do.
He would do that.
And I heard you guys say that I'd be like, check, please.
Yeah.
All right.
I'll pay for the water.
They would reintroduce the idea of red flags to him.
They'd be like, again, we need to have this discussion.
Oh, is that what you think?
You guys saw once.
Oh, my God.
I'm so ready to take a break in January.
I'm just gonna like.
You don't do anything.
You fucking record yourself vlogging.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize I was so stressful.
It's like saying I need to have a nap.
Crying in these videos is extremely daunting.
It's like saying, oh, that nap was so stressful.
I need to take another nap to recover from it.
You know, when you sleep for 14 hours and you're just tired.
Yeah, that's kind of how I'm feeling right now.
God, so you did a great job when you dragged those images onto the timeline
and you cut your own face out of your framing.
Like, good job, buddy.
I don't have sympathy for people who record a vlog
and then complain that they have like, they need to take a break.
Come on.
And have an opinion about a movie I saw once.
Oh, my God.
I'm so ready to take a break in January.
I'm just gonna like take the whole month.
It's all right.
He can't handle it.
Take that whole month.
You do that, buddy.
Yeah, you look like a guy who really could use less work.
If you like this video and you want to support the channel,
I suggest checking out my Patreon.
That's the names crawling up on the screen right now are my Patreon supporters.
Luckily, they're scrolling by at a really strange rate that I could barely read them out.
Gladnar, the dwarf supports him.
Gladnar, no.
Gladnar, no, this is the dwarves.
The dwarven ancestors frown upon your behavior.
Yes.
You've made all the dwarfs very many discussion videos.
And so, wow, exclusive Q and A's with Quentin reviews.
I guys get it before you get it before they run out of spaces.
$10.
Yeah, I was gonna get to ask a question.
Anyone who pledges $1 or more is gonna get to see the full video.
This month is going to be a bit of a like vlog sort of thing.
So I think that's gonna be fun.
So check that out if you would like to see content like that.

And if you're not subscribed, subscribe.
Because by the start of 2021, I want to hit 400,000 subscribers.
And I feel like we really need to start fighting for that now.
If it's ever gonna be realistic.
Man, I just never cared about my sub count.
With that, I've been quitting reviews, and that's all you need.
You should be quitting reviews.
Oh, fucking got him.
Get rekt, virgin.
We did it.
You did it, Reddit.
We defeated Quintonius.
We did it.
So that wasn't great.
He made some points in there.
It's like mid tier in terms of the fab videos we cover, right?
Rags, what would you say?
I mean, it's bad, but it's not like terrible.
And he made some points.
I definitely would be ashamed of it if I had made it, but it's not like it would.
It's almost, well, it's like the script was 50-50.
It was the production elements outside of the scripts that were just like,
oh man, you need to, he just, he doesn't have passion for it.
He considers that hard work now.
Like that's where he's at.
Like, Quinton, you gotta, I don't know, man.
You gotta, like, there are, there are vloggers out there
who can make the editing, like turn the vlog into just wonderful reviews.
Like costumes, you know?
Well, I was going to say, we actually have someone here right now who does vlog videos
that are rather entertaining thanks to the editing.
Oh my God.
Clearly she made the wrong decision.
She should have just been like, man, I kind of wanted to take a break.
Check out my place.
Ask me about my flannel.
Oh, I want to ask, since the big boy himself is here,
ER, for all the super funny edits that involve like random memes pulled from here and there,
do you just kind of have those saved or do you just know what to Google for those?
Because I always think to myself, like, how would anyone know to pull this one
clever quote from a movie?
There is a movie database you can go to, you can put in lines,
and it'll just bring up what you need sometimes.
But what about for like video clips of like goofy memes?
Are those things that you just like know off the top of your head?
Yeah, that's just me being too online.
Very one of them chuds on you.
One of them Nazi chuds.
I think they wanted Nazi chuds.
I bet you hate to talk to you.
Shut the fuck up now.
Is it intentional that it's supposed to be like rhyming with Chad or what?
Chads who eat each other.
That's how Chad they are.
So, I was going to say we could we could jump into just watching
because it's diabetes review of Rise of Skywalker.
Get excited, people.
Yay!
Chad, can we get some sub-hype in the chat?
So hype.
For anyone who doesn't know, this is movie Robert,
and he had the the hottest of takes about this movie.
All he had to say, I believe he gave it a score of eight out of ten.
Shocking to everyone.
Yes, that's what I've been told.
A fantastic film.
Eight out of ten.
Just yeah.
So let's.
I'm still tripping on that green door.
He even painted the door green.
It's such a fascinating creative.
Don't you have one piece of wall that's large enough?
That's like something I was trying to do.
Oh, man.
Here we go.
How do you use that door without rubbing all the green paint off every time?
You can tell the light switch, too.
It still looks a bit like thingy like that.
Like he has been maybe puts a glove on.
I just really want all of the green to come off of the door knob
and then in all the green screen bits, you just see a door knob sticking out.
Yeah, in the middle of the scene.
It's fine.
Just like the Mandalorian.
No Mandalorian ship.
But how come they didn't put like a curtain?
Why didn't he get a curtain like most people do?
Well, you don't have to fuck up your door and your light switch.
Because then he'd have to take another trip to a home depot.
Oh, what's the point anyway?
Because you didn't do the right hand side over here with the door frame beam on it.
Like what's the point?
You just fucked up your door and your light switch for nothing.
Also, we can worry.
You're trying to say something.
What was it?
Yeah, why did you like the Mandalorian, bro?
Oh, me?
Characters consistently do things that are contrary to information
that they have and are incredibly stupid.
And this is what drives the plot along.
There you go.
With that in mind.
Okay.
We'll have an, we'll have an Efap about it.
We will.
Okay.
We'll talk all about why the Mandalorian is really kind of garbage.
I know.
It'll be Efap's hot take of 2020.
Well, but I'm pretty, I'm pretty confident once we actually point it all out.
I mean, we're not going to get people disagreeing with us on episode four.
I know that much.
Oh yeah.
But imagine, but four is really just a, all the episodes after four are just four to slightly
lesser degree, except maybe the last one.
I don't know if that one's worse than four or not.
All right.
Yeah.
I mean, we'll.
Movie Bob says it's fine.
Oh, then if anything, that's just vindication of
what I said.
Also for me, it says there's four people in the room in the six of us.
Is anybody unable to get in right now?
Um, it's acting a little funny for me.
I'm in there.
If I'm going to take him back to zero, just tell me if it is not playing for you right now.
Relax.
It's fine.
Just like the Mandalorian is fine.
Just like the better animated ones are fine.
Just like Solo was fine.
I thought no Solo was terrible.
Solo is not fine.
How is everything just fine to you?
Except Joker, which is bad.
I was about to say he's such a bad guy.
I think he's like the weirdest creator we cover because I cannot predict like what he's going
to think of a thing.
I used to think it was just the reverse of what was what you could call the most likely
understanding of the product itself, if you will, the content, the media.
But like at this point, I don't know.
You could just have any take.
Also, we can worry here.
You're too quiet.
Chad is saying so boost your level or have quiet now.
Oh, wait.
Yeah, you're kind of quiet.
He's on either have Mahler boost your level for himself.
He's on maximum tisms, I'm afraid.
Yeah, then.
Yeah, just do it through windows.
I'll do the DC thing again.
Maybe boost your mic.
Oh, no, no, no.
Your your connection is fine.
You're just quiet.
Wait, wait.
Hello.
Is that better?
Hello.
Yes, we can hear you.
Good enough.
You're just quiet.
We'll see what you're saying right now.
Yeah, I I put output volume at max.
Oh, my God.
That's you at maximum times two on my end.
Yeah.
Well, how do you get so loud for your videos?
Oh, I got I got Adobe edition.
Curse you Adobe.
Obi one Adobe.
We can can you just try to like try to project a lot more right now
and let's see if that's louder.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, that's better.
Better.
Yeah.
Maybe just like kind of mumble in a little bit.
Hi.
Yeah, I think just.
This is this is Diabido.
Get excited.
Yeah, let's do it.
Come on, guys.
Let's do it.
Woo!
Most of the Star Wars stuff is fine apart from like a lot of terrible spin-off novelizations.
Fine.
Okay, seriously, like lay it all out.
And like two of these movies are really good.
Two of them are legit.
Damn bad.
One of them changed the world of cinema forever, irrespective of how good it was.
And the rest of them are fine.
I don't know which ones, which could be Bob saying it.
Yeah, I was going to say, I don't know which one.
Damn bad.
I think PLJ is like the game changer for him.
I think if there's only one game changer, it would have to be a new hope, surely.
Yeah.
But he said that was the one that changed cinema forever.
Unless he's saying the Last Jedi changed cinema forever.
It did not.
I think.
Unless you mean it encouraged other people to write terribly because you can make money regardless.
That's gotta be it.
Yeah, I don't know.
Like, fucking hell.
Decent.
Solid.
Good movie.
Maybe even a little better than that if you can divorce yourself completely from outside the
film bullshit about writer-director plans and studio insider politics no one actually knows
about, which you should do anyway unless related to that is your job.
I don't like how he cuts himself into himself.
It's really just disjointing.
Like, almost like he's interrupting himself.
Dude, don't even talk about the joint state of Diomedo.
How do you think his joints feel right now?
Yes.
Well, he can float.
Surely they'll do it okay.
Oh, god.
Then when he hits the ground and they have to support his weight, you're like, oh my god.
Bullshit about writer-director plans and studio insider politics no one actually
knows about, which you should do anyway unless related to that is your job.
Nobody knows about.
Okay, here we go.
Hey, guess what?
The big picture now has merchandise.
Oh, wow.
How do you fuck up your microphone after this long doing this video?
Yes!
Merchandise, yes!
Sorry, I get really excited about that.
Hey, guys.
Go to www.ribbubble.com forward slash people forward slash moviebob.
Did anyone buy that?
Forward slash 2529276-big-picture-with-moviebob-logo.
Just enter that in manually into your your little bar at the top.
And you go directly to the shirt.
Did anyone buy these?
Be honest, because oh my.
Who the fuck would want an article of clothing with his fucking name on it?
Oh, I don't want people associating your stance on eugenics with me, so.
That's right.
For the first time, you can get official shirts, different types of shirts, other clothes,
pillows and other things that say I've heard of this thing from the internet.
Check out our first ever design available exclusively.
Imagine having a pillow with his face on it.
Oh, I want a beanbag chair.
I would buy that.
No, just a bag for your face.
Oh, well.
And the last thing that he needs is more beans.
I mean, sure, I guess.
This is highbrow content on eFap, ladies and gentlemen.
Go for the beans.
Red Bull by following this link and keep an eye out for more big picture and moviebob
productions merchandise coming soon because you demanded it.
I didn't.
How lies in slander.
I did not demand anything.
Yeah, extra doubt.
Yeah.
What the fuck is this intro?
It's like a really manly metal guitar riff and then boom, you see a picture of a moviebob.
This is like Mike Tyson trying to sell encyclopedia Britannicas.
I'm a badass.
So cool.
It's also like a most boomer introduction.
Well, no pressure, huh?
Just to find out whether or not what's being pitched as the definitive end to something
we definitively know is not ending sticks a landing that, depending on who you ask,
either involves undoing and previously apologizing for having.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Fucking hell.
He talks like a trade.
Can you go back, Holler?
Can you look at the things are efficient and comfortable.
It's kind of like spoken word rap like already.
I'm like, I don't even know what he just said.
Like a shopping cart being pushed down a mountain.
You know, I guess I was poetic.
We're going to slow him a little bit.
Look at the green shirt.
There's a green part that's like cutting because of the tie fight is like fucked
because of the green screen.
He didn't talk to us last time in when he actually showed himself, did he?
I don't.
Yeah, because he had to go on last time.
It's the big picture is the show where he speaks fast.
Escape to the movies is supposed to be normal speed, but this is still just garbled.
That's just everybody waiting to find out whether or not what's being pitched is the
definitive end to something we definitively know is not ending sticks a landing that,
depending on who you ask, either involves undoing and previously apologizing for having offended
the sensibilities of someone in the previous sequel or offending those same sensibilities
more in the same way.
What was that?
I'm still kind of trying to process just what was being said there.
That was like a picture of nerds.
We need a translator.
Why do you speak this way?
Like a Twitter feminist to come and like transcribe what is being.
I'm going to repeat him again.
I just I'm going to do what I can here.
Jesus.
Being pitched as the definitive end to something we definitively know is not ending sticks a landing
that, depending on who you ask, either involves undoing and previously apologizing for having
offended the sensibilities of someone in the previous sequel or offending those same sensibilities
more in the same way.
All right, team, what have you got?
We need a professional.
We need a professional food taster.
I'm putting this I'm putting this shit in my mouth.
I just picture like so we'll put the statement in the center of a table gave a team an hour
and they came in.
There's blank pages like I don't know.
This is just he's saying something about like I think what he's trying to say is that it's
either it's going to piss some people off or it's going to piss other people off.
OK, it's basically some people will really like it.
Some people will really not like it.
And that's all you had to say.
But he had to do the most roundabout possible.
I think complicated method of expressing that, which is really like the opposite of what language
should do.
But like he thinks this is like alliteration and good writing.
It's like it's a very stylish review, but it's really just like, well, Patrick Willems said
he was good.
You calling Patrick Willems a liar?
Calling him incompetent.
Yes, also that I believe Patrick Williams would lie very easily.
Well, that's probably because, well, you didn't like The Last Jedi, right?
Did you like Rose Tico?
Yes, I hate women, but he's not a woman.
So what's my excuse now?
Yeah.
I gotcha.
I'm untouchable.
Oh, all right.
Let's let's I think I think I understand the fit.
Let's let's give him another sentence then.
Let's see where we go.
Man, remember back when the important thing was how you felt about a movie instead of whether
or not it was making some other hypothetical person you dislike feel one way or the other
weird, huh?
Oh, that ain't on us, buddy.
I solely dislike this movie because the people that I hate like it.
That's my entire modus operandi.
I mean, we would downright curious how people will get a feel about this movie,
but that doesn't change how we felt about it.
Like, yeah, still fit.
That's why it's nice to be objective.
You don't have to worry about shit like that.
Wow, Rags, that just triggered a thousand people.
Oh, my God.
How could you do that?
Good, because apparently all I care about is making people angry.
So you do remember how you killed out, right?
I did kill art.
I went to its funeral and I took a fucking shit on his wife.
Oh, why I can't I can't be dealing with this life.
Life's just attending the funeral.
You just walk over to the dump.
I just I just walked up and I just lifted my leg and pissed on her dress.
That's why we're black at funerals, sister.
Now, in case you can't tell, the fact that it was accepted as kind of a given
that the reviews of Rise of the Skywalker were going to most skywalker.
This is a meme going around like people just keep fucking up.
It is called the Rise of Skywalker.
A lot of people call it Rise of Skywalker, which I think is fair.
But some people are going to get the Rise of the Skywalker.
Which is actually technically more accurate.
I suppose.
Yeah, because it's a singular person.
Only one left.
They're all fucking dead.
Well, it's pretty hollow, isn't it?
Apparently all you need to raise Skywalker is just have someone go.
I'm a Skywalker now.
Yep.
That's it.
It's very emotional and wonderful.
Beautiful.
Use of its relationship to the last Jedi and the grotesquely over discussed tantrum
a particular tragic slice of the internet has been having about it since it came out
is something I find kind of annoying.
So I'm kind of relieved.
These flirt.
Oh, yeah.
You come across like you don't realize that I'm not looking to do that.
So I can skip it here for now.
So if I don't have to spend years of it.
Just talk about the fucking movie.
You don't have to go to the long diatribe about the history and blah blah blah.
Let's talk about the fucking movie.
No, that would be that's what just just what the chuds want.
Oh, then it must be wrong.
Oh, shit.
I don't even know.
I find a lot of merit in the idea that this movie is a reaction or apology to the last one
any more than the last one was some kind of swipe against the rest of the franchise or
JJ Abrams or whatever.
I just don't see any indication of the production of mouth's trilogy being any kind of conflict.
So much as an awkward game of telephone being played by only two people with three
turns because JJ Abrams came back in to do this last one instead of the originally
tapped director Colin Trevorrow.
And there's a definite sense.
What did he how did he how did he describe Colin Trevorrow?
Originally tapped.
Which is okay.
Phrasing wise.
I thought he said that.
Yeah.
Well, he spent like I followed that like I get it.
You're saying that the films are funky because it's like
it's being passed between people who have these directors.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Following.
I'm the square a bunch of ideas that he must have had about where things might go in the next two
when setting up the force awakens originally while also respecting the actual plot points
and scenario left in place by Ryan Johnson and the last Jedi.
And as you might expect the result of that is
is this going to be a review of the film or.
What's going to be like half over half of Quentin's video where it's just like other shit.
A notably long seven minutes.
Yeah, we're still not halfway.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, but still this is this is a review of a movie that's seven minutes total and
we're three minutes in and he hasn't talked about the movie yet.
It's fine.
He said it's fine.
Remember that.
Oh, okay.
Way back.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
He said it's all fine though.
And if everything's fine, it doesn't help us to say that this is fine.
Despite Ryan Johnson and the last Jedi and as you might expect the result of that is a
notably long very action heavy and propulsively paced final installment that occasionally feels
like two films worth of plot compressed into a single film worth of narrative as concerns the
spoiler free excluding stuff that's just basic plot info or already in the trailer because those
don't count narrative in question.
The already chaotic war state between the resistance and first order has been thrown
into chaos on both ends by the apparent resurrection of Emperor Palpatine.
Kylo Ren wants to find it in chaos for the first order.
They're doing pretty well.
Apparently, they're on planets.
They're rounding people up.
They're doing okay.
It's really weird.
Well, they have that line in the opening of the film where they're like,
he wants to kill any threat to Kylo wants to kill the threat to his power.
But then like halfway through the film, he's like,
Palpatine doesn't realize that me and you can kill him because we're a dyad in the force that
it's like, wait, how do you even know what that is?
We want that at the end, he sort of pops up, I guess, throw down a hole.
So like Kylo's perspective on Palpatine is just kind of like, I don't really know.
Also, if Snoke knew that Rey was really important and that he needed to that Kylo needed to kill
her and Snoke was a creation of Palpatine who is basically being controlled by Palpatine.
How would Palpatine not know that they're a dyad?
Also, he seems to be able to spy on them all the time.
Remember how he's like inside Kylo's head and he also he's the one who set up there for Skype, right?
Yeah, it was Snoke through Palpatine, I guess.
Very hard to keep track of how everything works.
Yeah, it's hard to control who's got mind control over who or who's controlling who or
it's very it's strange.
It's a very strange film.
I just feel like it doesn't really make sense.
You know, you ever got that feeling with this movie?
It's just it's bullshit.
That doesn't make any sense.
It's fine, Rags.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.
I feel fine.
I feel fine.
Eeyar, do you feel it makes sense?
Oh, yes.
Your fucking subscriber is going to get very disappointed if that's you're going to give
it to me a take, dude.
He's subverting.
Eeyar, please help us.
They're fucking scary.
They're terrified.
We can't we can't quash this uprising.
You must tell them that it does not make any fucking sense.
All makes as much sense as it ever did.
Repeat after me.
Diabido.
He's worried he might challenge him to lead the first order.
The resistance also wants to find him because, you know, he's the big bad guy.
And he might replenish their enemies with powerful weapons.
And well, motivations end up shifting around at least one of those two fronts.
Both sides end up treasure hunting for an ancient Sith relic that will help locate
the once thought mythic Sith homeworld.
Well, Palpatine is presumably high.
Those cuts, man.
Like what is going on?
Yeah, just just speak like a normal fucking person.
Do you think he brought normally some pauses in between words or sentences?
Yeah, do you think that he's like trying to do a sentence and he continues the sentence
after the breath and then in editing, he's like, oh, got to cut that breath.
And he cuts it so finely.
The words connect to each other like that.
You're like, whoa, that's how you do it.
It's like a jump cut.
It's so much effort to edit to make your video worse.
Probably makes it more intelligent and like snappy.
I'm so definite with everything that I say.
I just bam, bam, bam, point after point after point.
I'm so just like a fucking point machine.
Just like a logical machine gun.
I work for the escapist.
He says that to himself after every sentence.
Can I also point out at this point, like Palpatine was trying to do
Ben by saying, I'll give you my fleet.
But was it the first order like on top of the world already that really not.
Yeah.
So like the first order had the same kind of ships and the same kind of armor
and the same forms and command structure.
But they were a totally different thing underneath Palpatine.
Like when they came up from the ground, was Palpatine like were they just
in there hoping that Kylo said yes, so they could go home or what?
That's the.
I'm so confused.
Apparently those ships are stocked by 3000 units.
So they're all just sitting in the ground running off of something like they've
probably got some maybe like some some canned foods and they're like, oh man,
Kylo, find that way.
Find us so that Emperor Palty can lift us up.
Finally, I want to know which way is up.
It's bizarre and it's definitely one of those things.
It's like, don't think about it.
Don't think about it.
Don't think about it.
And then you're like, oh, fuck, I did.
I fuck.
Did think about it because it's really dumb.
Ray, having been studying the sacred Jedi text, believe she knows where to look.
But that means going back into battle early before
completing her Jedi training at a general layup.
Have we ever actually seen a Jedi finish their training?
That's a good point.
Like I know it's the thing about training.
You never finish your training.
You see, movie is the apex reviewer.
He's the best ever.
So he thinks that you can indeed ascend to godhood.
He is.
Movie has completed his training.
Doesn't Yoda say that Luke finished his training in
Empire, retraining the Jedi?
I think Bobbert's point was that.
Yes, go on.
Yeah, but not like like there's no like Luke finished off a big robot.
And then Yoda came in and said, you did it, Luke.
You train.
No, Jedi training level 10.
Yeah, yeah.
Bob's Bob wants that.
Because I don't think that's how it works.
I think the master just randomly goes like, yes, enough, I guess.
You're pretty good.
I don't want you to show me up, so we're going to quit there.
I feel like Leia was probably like, you have probably finished your training.
You are the most powerful creature on this planet.
She's like, OK, cool.
I did it.
I ran for a bit.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, also Leia stopped being a Jedi.
Like she didn't complete the training technically, right?
Yeah, well, I mean, he's got he's got
a partial point.
It seems like nobody really everyone always abandons training.
Like, but yeah, but then Leia is now a master at training.
Ray.
Oh, yeah.
No, I don't understand how she can train Ray.
I don't see how that works, especially if she left training.
What seemed to be very early on in her own trade.
I don't know.
And also since her needs training.
Yeah.
Also, I'd like the floating ball when she beat Luke's ass in TLJ.
Pop that shit.
I mean, yeah, Luke is just awful.
Luke's just worthless.
It looks pretty pathetic.
Why are you surprised by that?
Was Luke something else at some point?
Yeah, my bad.
My bad.
He was always a pathetic piece of shit.
Of course.
Of course.
Oh, wow.
You think that no one has any flaws by saying that?
Yeah.
Let's go back.
We're told that all of the Jedi we've seen finish training.
Finished training.
But we never really see anyone who starts do it.
Anyway, ultimately the quest becomes a planet to planet chase between the main heroes and Kylo
Ren with a newly added wrinkle of Ray being plagued by Force visions relating to her still
enigmatic past and must pull towards situations that might explain that.
Meaning that the non-Jedi heroes are amusingly operating at the mercy of a super powered friend
whose exceptional skills and magic abilities they need, but who is also not quite there right
now and keeps wandering off in between.
Yeah, I agree.
It's really weird.
She has more than one moment of just being like, well, I'm going to fuck off now.
But it's like, um, you're like the best person on our team, but okay.
All right.
Star quarterback.
I guess we'll try to win without you.
And like Poe gets pissed at it, if you remember.
And he's like, what the fuck?
And then then Finn pulls out the whole like, you're not Leia or something to pose like.
Wow.
Yeah, I was like, oh my God, this is such a revelation to me that I'm not Leia.
And in the theater, I was like, thank God, he's not Leia.
They'd all be dead right now.
It's just that the whole like, I'll be dead right now if he was.
I just don't like the attitude of post always wrong.
He's trying to be reasonable in like every scene.
Oh, guy, like he, he did like the super risky moves in the opening to save everyone's lives
and get the information for the rebellion.
He gets off the ship.
He like fucking like probably pretty stressed out, anxious about the fact that he died.
Then you got this woman being like, hey, you damaged my ship.
You're like, oh, I'm sorry.
And she was like, you can't light speed skip the compressors all fucking.
He's like, okay, but I did.
So I don't know.
Oh, do you know Po wasn't really done anything that impressive.
Just think about anything.
Really think of me and what has he done?
Oh, killed the star killer base.
He lords that over everybody.
It didn't really matter.
They had a thousand more of those.
Yeah.
And apparently one why we can just shoot at one for like two seconds on us.
I want to blow it up.
So really what you did, Po is pretty.
I mean, that's like what we expect you to do.
It's nothing that anyone can do it.
Uh, some people are suggesting.
It's like, well, we know that people finished their training.
Like Anakin was almost becoming a master.
We know Obi-Wan did.
It's like in fitness, the movie, Bobby saying we don't get the scene
in which they complete their training.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like you're finished now.
You know, there's no graduation, you know, you don't get your trophy
and you're like, hooray, you did it.
You're a Jedi knight now or a master.
Now you got to the top.
So good job.
Well done.
Let's go have a let's go have a snack.
That's what I do.
I probably got a snack with Qui-Gon Jinn.
It'd be great.
Oh my God.
Tell us about just everything.
You know what's going to happen?
Like to all of this, it's fucking nuts.
You have no idea what you'll start up, dude.
The state of the universe is going to be so batshit insane.
You wouldn't even believe it.
There are reunions, reveals, chases, saber duels, rescues, and of course,
a great big space battle.
That's about all I can really say plot wise without people yelling at me about spoilers.
Is it a bit too long?
Yeah.
But for the most part, it really cooks because it's all for moving action.
It's all for moving action.
You couldn't edit that?
It's an interesting or innovative is the last.
Why can't you just say a sentence?
Just say a sentence.
It really cooks.
I'm not.
Yeah, like it was like it went really quickly.
Yeah, right.
I've just not heard someone refer to it that way before.
All right.
I wouldn't be surprised if I heard movie Bob.
If movie Bob ever used the phrase like razzle dazzle,
and ironically, one of his like video reviews, I would not be surprised.
Oh my goodness.
Razzle dazzle.
The old razzle dazzle.
Give me old razzle dazzle.
When he talks about cooked, he means like food.
Cooking food to get it to an edible state.
So the movie really became edible.
That's what he's saying.
It nourished him.
Right.
It continued to expand the lore if you understand my meaning.
No, but I do think on balance, it's better than The Force Awakens,
particularly because while it's everyone is committed to the initial new trilogy
gimmick of being self consciously about a new generation grappling with having inherited Star
Wars.
I thought you liked meta stuff.
I mean, meta narratives.
I thought he loved it all.
I wonder how many actual like real people out there go into this.
Oh, yeah, this is actually commentary on the meta narrative.
In fact, the new generation is inheriting Star Wars,
just in the way that in the universe, all these characters are blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Is it?
No, no one does.
No one gives a shit about that.
Bob was just like, you talked to the average movie go.
They're like, well, I just I don't know.
There was lightsabers and I remember people killing each other and stuff.
I don't know.
Yeah, I loved it.
It was my favorite.
It was my favorite part.
This is my favorite part.
To this one is more in conversation with the prior events and decisions of its actual characters
as opposed to the events of two earlier trilogies character.
And if you're looking for a coherent through line at this trilogy,
at this point, it feels clear that Awakens was meet the new heroes.
Last Jedi was here.
This one is OK.
Here's who they definitely are.
On the more visceral side, there's some very strong and innovative action beats,
including a solution to a space battle that I don't think even Star Wars has tried to pull off
before and all of that psychic force communication.
What is he referring there?
Is he referring to the final battle at the end?
Solution to a space battle.
Is he talking about like the specific mechanics of the solution?
Like, oh, they don't have shields.
You have to shoot the underbelly cannons.
I don't know.
Let's give him a good old listen again, because this video has been strange.
It feels clear that Awakens was meet the new heroes.
Last Jedi was here's who everyone definitely isn't.
And now this one is OK.
Here's who they definitely are.
On the more visceral side, there's some very strong and innovative action beats,
including a solution to a space battle that I don't think even Star Wars has tried to pull off before.
Is he referring to like the final battle?
He must be.
Yeah, that is.
Yeah, because that's the only one that I remember.
Because the only other one was the TIE fighter chase.
Yeah.
And the only reason that's never been thought of is because it's never been an issue before.
It's because Rian Johnson made it an issue.
It's just funny, though, because it's such a like almost because you know how it's the beginning of the movie.
I like to think that maybe JJ was like, all right, let's give it our best shot.
First thing we got to do is fix the fact that they can track us through lightspeed or hyperspace.
They say lightspeed in the in the films, but maybe that's just shorthand to refer to hyperdrive.
Probably, I think.
He totally gave up on that further on in the film because they don't use it ever again.
But they use hyperspace.
They just say, like, they're not following us.
How weird?
It's like, well, well, somebody sent me this.
It's a little old, but it holds up.
I bought a boom font.
Dick chocolate.
And also someone reminded.
Oh, geez.
Droid had the map thingy to Exegol.
Yeah.
So oh, you know, great.
It's it's a bad.
And yeah, there's that that Twitter thing where, like, Bob followed someone.
You're like, oh, that's so bad.
Fuck did I wrong that Robert follows me.
Yeah, it feels bad, man.
One of the worst people I've ever seen on this site.
I'm really glad you don't get to enjoy Night of the Woods because you're too dense to understand it.
Oh, poor Robert.
Oh, man.
Like, nobody likes him.
Patrick Willems likes I don't know.
Yeah, that's like a negative.
That's like negative people liking you.
I guess.
Yeah, that's a moment of like, oh, oh, Robert, we're his biggest fans.
Diabeto forever.
He's going to have his own saga.
It's going to be great.
And all of that psychic force communication, projection, reaching across time and space power
introduced in Last Jedi gets used in a bunch of clever, elaborate ways.
Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are both home.
They're individual characters and chemistry to a very strong place.
And their scenes together are easily the strongest in the film.
There's also a lot of enjoyable new side characters, including some wonderfully alien
looking aliens and some at least two new supporting heroines who both seem to have
spin off maybe named tags underneath their uniforms.
Oh, yeah.
I can't wait to get more of Zori Bliss and the other one.
No.
Oh, Janna.
She uses a bow.
He does use a break.
That's interesting.
Yeah, they're great.
I guess especially.
Yeah, so much we can do with this video because he's just vaguely
complimenting the film and it's like, huh?
Yeah.
He actually liked the weird thing.
It's true.
I will say that while this definitely feels like a return to the familiar JJ Abrams style
of Star Wars, it's also a more interesting film because of what it has to grapple with
having been left with it by the Last Jedi and not just in the new force powers.
It's a much more interesting, unusual who can say if Abrams liked or disliked any of
the plot turns that he's been left.
I think it's pretty obvious that he didn't.
I think it's like obvious that he didn't.
If we had to guess, I think it's safe to say that he fucking hated the Last Jedi.
And I think that he was downright reserved in terms of what he probably could have done,
but he didn't not take a just shoot where he could in terms of just like, yeah, you know what?
This thing?
Fuck this thing.
We need episode 10 to be made by Rian Johnson just to see all the hitbacks,
but then that would mean having another Star Wars film by Rian Johnson.
So maybe that's not worth it.
And this is almost six minutes and he hasn't really given his real thoughts.
First few minutes of this review and you could have stopped it.
And you get what Bob thinks of Rise of Skywalker.
Pretty much.
A little highlight that he said alien looking aliens.
I'm giving him a pass for it because of the fact that you can have human looking aliens in Star Wars.
I guess he's trying to say they actually look like the alien creatures versus humanoids or
whatever. I guess that's what he's going for.
Yeah, I think he Bob is kind of what you get when you get so up your own ass about like a
metanarrative and just critiquing things that a normal critique, like just a very plain.
I like this.
I didn't like that.
It just feels like no, it's too shallow.
It's too superficial.
I got to go into like I got to narrate narration.
I got to think about thoughts and it just becomes this whole circle jerk about like
who has the wrong opinions instead of just like, yeah, I thought it was good.
Fucking for sure.
The way he speaks is like I just.
I always wonder if his people in his fan base, like if they consume one of his videos,
how much can they actually recant even if it's just three minutes of it?
How much can they say back to me?
I just be like, I probably think he's like a visionary genius critic.
Sure.
He thinks very highly of his self himself that he thinks that he's incredible.
I would hope so.
He's definitely a genius carries himself with such a confidence.
There's no way he had this.
There's like a humble bone in that fat, amorphous body.
But it certainly added elements of new dynamic storytelling to what was previously
mostly a nostalgia trip.
In the end, it is a big movie full of Star Wars stuff.
Well-directed with a good cast.
I had a bunch of fun watching it.
I found the big emotional heartstring tugging moments pretty powerful for the most.
Wow, that's crazy.
They were all just like comedy for me.
Does he know how much like his sort of group of friends,
if you will, in terms of critics hate this movie?
Like Patrick Willems fucking hated this film.
I wonder how that went down.
I wonder if Bob was like, hey, man, it's not that bad.
Still recommend.
Why he still recommends Movie Bob.
One of the good ones.
Maybe he doesn't anymore.
Maybe he needs to teach Bob what his mistakes are.
He thinks this is an eight out of 10.
Easy layout, genuflection, and nostalgia in order to guarantee a Pavlovian emotional
response and I'm still getting legitimately choked up.
Clearly the filmmakers are doing something right.
Like I said, that's about where I can get without spoilers.
I'll likely do another episode of the other show soon with more of that nitty gritty stuff.
For now, I like movies.
I like Star Wars when it's good.
Rise of the Skywalker is a good Star Wars movie.
So I'm going to give this one eight out of 10.
Wow.
Eight out of 10.
There it is.
Wow.
Wow.
There it is.
It's a great Star Wars movie.
It's eight out of 10.
Complete with boomer outro.
Does that make it?
Jeez.
Wow.
Loads of people use that ping sound and loads of people play it way too loud.
Like I like cheeseburgers and the cheeseburger I found on the silo road was eight out of 10.
I love cheeseburgers and cheeseburgers.
I think what would always be more than the ding is the
everything that moves on screen has to whoosh violently.
Yeah, I don't even.
That's like my pet peeve.
Also, yeah.
I'm not a huge fan of sound effects myself.
He said Pavlovian as well to describe something back there.
I sort of just skipped over it.
So I was like, Bob, you're a strange man.
And like this video, like it's probably the most normal video he's made in terms of just.
Yeah, it is.
He just sort of.
He just sort of explained a bunch of like vagaries about a movie being okay to good
and they gave it a really high score.
Eight out of 10 is pretty good.
Like I'm surprised he must get out of 10 is.
Oh man, if your career was an eight out of 10.
Fucking solid work, man.
A Hall of Fame for you.
Like also spoiler for you reviewed is completely relinquishes him of the need to like
specify even the slightest qualifier as to why he enjoyed it.
Yeah, you just couldn't.
He couldn't even be bothered to say like, I like the themes.
Oh, this I thought the pacing was good.
He just talked about like the audience and shit for a while.
May the force be with you.
I feel like with music like that, it's just like,
yeah, I'm fucking hardcore hardcore review.
Hardly Davidson.
Look at the res of the fucking audience.
It's like pixelated like, come on, Bob.
You know, Bob.
Bob Chipman, 82 at gmail.com.
That's his I.
You need to do that or that or that.
That could be it.
He thought that he thinks that eight out of 10 is good.
So an 82 IQ must be really good.
What if this end slate is just like copy and pasted from like an old like 2007
review that he did, and that's why the resolution is the way that it is.
The music like you can't help but feel the music is just like, wow,
this is just you made this 10 years ago and you never changed it.
Jessica.
Sorry, what is Big Luke?
Big Luke.
Big Luke is my name.
I give to my door, my green door.
Watch out for old big.
I open them, close them.
Wolf said that outro music for Bob reminds me of when Brett
Keene used his brother's music in his video.
Oh, yeah, it's kind of remember this.
Oh, my God.
Get more Bob.
Get more Bob.
You thought it did this not satisfy you.
Do you need to be done for a drive after this?
Well, you could get more Bob at Movie Bob Central.
I guess maybe Movie Bob was let me check if Movie Bob was taken.
Oh, my God.

You want Movie Bob dot com?
What are you going to offer me?
That's why I know like make me an offer, my dude.
But yeah, Mr. Weekend Warrior is about his time to escape this horrible stream.
He's saying we should super chat fund buying Movie Bob dot com.
I think you could pull it off.
Yeah, you could crowdfund.
I mean, Quentin got his sex style crowdfunded.
Why not?
I don't know.
Anything is possible.
Not us.
We're going to do highbrow stuff like buying Movie Bob dot com.
Just so Movie Bob can't have it.
But yes, before you go, would you like to tell people about your channel and why they should
subscribe?
Hello.
Yes.
Subscribe to my channel, folks, lads and ladies, because I I'd like to think I do fun stuff.
Yeah, you do.
I like your videos.
Thank you.

You're welcome.
Did you mean Ewok?
Thanks, Mike.
My Ewok.
Instead of word, it's Ewok.
It's going to be a thing.
I don't know.
I get influenced heavily by Nazi YouTube as like with the reviews.
And I guess I've just picked it up.
I know.
It's Ewok with a hard K.
People that are saying if they all give one dollar,
we'll be able to buy Movie Bob dot com.
Can we get that as like a fucking stretch?
Yeah, let's do it.
If everyone gives a dollar, Movie Bob dot com belongs to Efap.
Yeah.
Come on, guys.

You would be so like defeated.
You'd be like, wow.
Yeah, that would be.
You fuckers.

Thank you for hanging out with us for as long as you did.
This was fun.
Yeah.
I mean, thanks.
Thanks for coming.

Thanks for having me.
My Ewoks.
You bet.
Talking dude.
I'll see you soon.
Oh, yes.
Good night.
Good morning.
Yeah.
Oh, you know.
It's morning here, my Ewoks.
Yay.
Morning here.
My Ewoks.
I was probably going to kick up honestly.
My Ewoks.
Okay.
My Ewoks.
I'll see you.
I'll see you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I hope he uses that in one of his videos and his subscribers
have no fucking clue what he's talking about.
My Ewoks.
My Ewoks.
You need that deep lore.
But yeah, so we defeated both Diabeto and Quintonius.
Though Diabeto's one was kind of like...
Kind of meh.
He's got another video where he goes into more detail.
Maybe we'll cover that one another time.
It's called The Rise of Skywalker's Polarizing Critics,
but for what reasons?
And this is who?
That's Diabeto.
Everybody is the soul of wit.
Diabeto?
Oh, my goodness.
Diabeto's the soul of wit.
Obviously some...
Diabeto's a silhouette?
The soul of wit.
Those are like $1.00 donations right now.
People really want that website, I guess.
Dude, yeah, absolutely.
Dude, yeah, absolutely.
You know, it's like my favorite fucking...
Never mind, I lost my train of thought
thinking about Diabeto.
I was super interested in your train of thought.
I know.
His gravitational pull just yanked me
out of my series of thoughts.
His gravitational pull.
Because he's a massive...
But yeah, I suppose there are some memes
I'm going to need to collect.
We can go through them and then read some super chats.
This would obviously be a good juncture
if anybody would like to eject themselves
or hang around.
It's completely up to you.
I'm staying full time, baby.
Ew.
All right, man.
Well, then you guys got to stop a conversation
about something while I collect memes.
It's very important that I do this.
Okay, chat real quick.
What video games and or anime are you consuming
at the moment?
This is a line graph question.
Well, yeah, Minecraft is a given.
But beyond that, you know, like I really
I seriously got back into Minecraft.
My buddy, but around we've been playing Minecraft.
Been playing Halo and Delvin a little bit
back into Vermintide to remember when you
and the metal commander and Mahler and I
all played Halo together that one time.
And you guys you guys need to know that Rags
is extremely good at Halo.
He's really always has the highest kill count
out of all of us.
Oh, I guess I'm just good shooters.
I'm just good shooters, I guess.
I enjoy them.
I really enjoy them.
What else have I been playing?
Other than Minecraft.
I'm going to check my library.
The forest a little bit.
Yeah, yeah.
Dabble and Mordhous still.
To the people playing Final Fantasy 14,
what classes are you playing?
That's what I need to know.
If it's anything other than Dark Knight or Red Mage.
I don't care.
Master Chief collection.
I don't play the Final Fantasy 14 game.
Yeah, I played it for a while
and then I just realized it's.
It's like people with Destiny 2
or really any other game like that,
or they just they kind of log in
just to do their daily things.
And then as soon as they're done,
they're just like, okay,
I didn't get any enjoyment out of that whatsoever.
I'll do it again tomorrow.
That's it, that's all you got.
Yeah, that's all I got.
Yeah, I never I never felt at any point
like I needed to get back into playing Destiny 2.
Like, I just feel like if I'm going to sink time into games,
Destiny 2 just isn't up there anywhere near being up there.
Yeah, honestly, now that Halo's on PC,
there's like no reason.
Got some risk of rain twos
and summoner.
We've got a warrior.
Divinity Original Sin 2.
Fantastic game.
Elite Dangerous.
Deus Ex Mankind Divided.
Good to see that pop up.
We've been having plenty of Witcher 3s.
Yeah, man.
If anyone in chat is particularly
as into the VR scene as me,
get Vox Machinae on Steam.
Search V-O-X.
They feel like a good VR game.
You control the mech like you're in the cockpit
moving handles and gear sticks and stuff like that.
It's a really good time.
You actually have to physically pick up a radio
to talk to your teammates.
I play Gundam music and I shoot the rockets at people.
Alright, my memes have been prepared.
That's you get.
You get that.
You translated that, right?
This is obviously top quality.
Little bit like almost everybody,
even like people in my family were like,
why did you keep using this lightning?
It's a little strange.
I would have stopped because I know
like when I accidentally touch a hot stove,
I'm like, oh, no, let's not do that.
I regret this decision immediately.
No, I'm picturing you.
You put your hand on it.
You just keep it there going.
This is the only thing that can give me
direction at this point.
He's pretty old.
This is obviously a wonderful photo of Quinton in the wild.
Yeah, he's a carrot.
I called him a carrot.
I'm sorry.
I get uncontrollable sometimes.
I call them a potato.
Who knows where this could go?
How many vegetables could he be?
It's just...
I'm so excited to see what plants he'll become.
I like this drawing a lot.
I mean, this image.
That's basically it.
I like that.
When did he make that face?
I don't actually know.
God, that's the face of regret.
Oh, my goodness.
How could a sex doll look so sad?
It's just the face of like, you don't know what he does.
Is there any other emotions for a sex doll, really?
Terrible.
Awful.
This is the musings of several memes
placed into each other, you know?
Represented by efap lore.
The infinity music reality would be the cosmic chicken.
Mind would be begidious.
Time would be the spider.
Space would be...
Is that the disappearing knife itself?
Is that the infinity stone?
Power 1.2 billion and soul be ghost milk?
It makes enough sense, I think.
We've got something to work with there.
We've got a few mystery boxes worth opening.
I love mystery boxes.
Yes.
Where did begidious come from, anyway?
Because I love his stoic expression.
So, that's the 50th episode.
In fact, E.R. was there for the birth of begidious.
It's a good character. Good OC.
I love begidious.
It's great.
I feel like...
That's great.
I really like that.
I fucking love that clip.
It's like my favorite thing.
I want to incorporate it all.
Isn't that the one where he's just like...
Isn't that the one where he's like,
where'd you bring me?
It's just absurdly sudden.
Like, I can't remember what he's watching on the laptop
or someone just walks in and she's like,
uh, are you okay?
I know the whole...
He just slams.
I was, what'd you bring me?
Violently fucking slams the table.
I think this is fair.
The first order.
Do not know which way is down.
Watch Vsauce.
There was no internet connection next to goal.
Sorry.
Oh, no.
If only.
I actually wanted to send out our chat.
I love that.
He looks like he's got like fuck me eyes in that picture.
No!
Would you fuck me?
I know.
That's why I have a sex doll.
Don't lie to me.
I just hear, don't you want me, baby?
Here's one.
Somebody just...
I know you've been compiling them,
but I'll post this one.
Maybe you have it or not.
Let me click the button for it.
There we go.
I don't know what I'm looking at with this.
Yeah, this one is...
You want a gene?
Quentin, you brought this on yourself, you know?
Like, this is why, you know,
YouTube has rules.
You're not supposed to be saying stuff like that.
Is that facial hair, dude?
Yeah.
People are going to tweet.
People are going to tweet so much racist shit at them now.
That wonky mustache button shop thing.
Scariest facial hair.
Let's go my E word.
Let's go my E word to the saloon.
Obviously, just a screenshot from the movie.
Pretty interesting.
I can see how you can sort of connect Harry Potter.
Yeah.
It's like one in the same.
Yeah.
Oh my god.
Is this a crossover?
Like official?
You sitcom.
Sitcom.
That's a clever word, boy.
I'm surprised they didn't have a quote like he wants,
you know, a specific food.
I mean, Palpatine's probably going to be pretty aggressive when it comes to that stuff.
I need snacks to recharge my energy.
Now, that's what I get.
Oh, yeah.
You didn't explain the rules.
If Hitler kills Hitler, does he become Hitler or was he already Hitler?
Double Hitler.
Double Hitler.
Oh, no, not double Hitler.
Not a potential out of that Harry Potter obsession he has.
Yeah.
It's weird how they have.
They just always talk about Harry Potter.
It's like his captive.
I didn't agree.
Can I go now?
You can.
This is a dark universe.
I installed an app that translates incoherent rambling,
so I can understand what this old retard is saying.
I thought Jay's avatar fits perfectly into that image, too.
It does.
Why is Quentin's face so fucking punchable?
Probably doesn't help the stupid shit that he says that probably doesn't,
you know, like, you know, that Louis C.K. joke where he's talking about,
like, in his day, the use of the word faggot and how it's like,
I would say something like people from Phoenix or Venetia, that's like Quentin.
Like, he looks like the kind of guy who would just correct you over innocuous shit.
He'd be like, fuck off.
Shut up.
China is racist.
He's making like an O face in every picture we have of him.
Yes, yes.
He's a terrible face.
I don't even remember what the context is for this.
Get him, Fringy.
Oh, this I'm posting this again.
Fuck it.
It's so good, though.
It's horrible.
This is the red flag thing, I think.
I'm going to put out like a five hundred dollar bounty
for anyone that can find Quentin making like a soy face.
That's exactly what we were talking about.
Like how he's the woman, though.
Fuck me, please.
Actually, that kind of is the soy face in the upper left there.
We've checked off Raylow shippers, nostalgia bait lovers.
I mean, the racists of the boardroom, that would be ER.
You know, that's just I'm sorry that they got a mix up in this meme.
But, you know, still.
They can deliver on either of them.
Relevant.
I really thought that you, Genesis, would have had something for me.
Well, yeah, there you go.
Movie Bob can disappoint.
Let's put it that way.
ER, has anyone ever told you that your gentle, slightly hoarse voice
is kind of like ASMR?
Uh, no.
Count one for that, fucko.
I was going to say, that's not a pretty sexual, that no.
This one is bullshit.
Quentin has never looked this masculine.
Well, it's a fantasy fiction.
But I like that the Bob one kind of does the whole gaunt, yet large face.
Yeah, yeah, pretty accurate.
He's got the dimples.
How are you so large, but the front of your face is like and like is clearly withering away.
Two Quentin's and a diabetes.
How could we possibly defeat such a powerful beast?
Someone in chat said, why are we so obsessed with Quentin?
It's so easy.
He's just so meme-able.
Yeah, he is.
I mean, look at that face right there.
He looks like he's reluctantly pushing out like a wet fart at all times.
Kind of.
He's a love job.
Also, this was the Quentin episodes.
Of course, there'll be Quentin memes abound.
Abound.
I like this one because it's true.
Yeah, he's got that shit eating grin when he's smashing it, too.
You can't stop me.
You had your movie.
Now I have mine.
No maxis.
I missed Jay.
It's OK.
He's been he's been pre-kicked for this one.
Pre-kicked.
Somewhat totalitarian, a little overtly flashy.
That's political harassment.
Thanks, Fred.
This is the I remember making this this meme.
I mean, it being made.
There's like a bit when I was talking about only plays before where they're just like,
give George ours.
Lightsaber make them make them the main character.
They're just like, George, stop, stop it.
George just having to fucking hold him back.
What am I missing with this one?
I don't know.
Oh, I think it's Chugs.
Oh, oh, I guess I could apply.
No, terrifying.
No way.
Um, this is the political compass of tone.
Look, I guess, because I kind of specifically remember all of the the woke Star Wars video
wasn't even about being woke.
Also, it's very pixelated.
He thinks that like he definitely doesn't use it in the context of
what it normally is used for.
Right.
He's a fascinating enigma, to the least.
Just a good old fashioned Photoshop here.
This is your mind on daily.
One that arguably.
That's not a bad job.
Okay, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Matt didn't win the win the vote.
We'll have to see what he has to say another time.
Oh, yeah.
This is tonal does not like.
Sidelined again.
Hooked carrots.
Fuck.
Like when that happened, you guys were like, whoa.
It's just rare to see such passion.
Yeah, the daily to the dead speak.
The world has heard a mysterious broadcast, a threat of revenge and a sinister voice of the
late.
The message comes directly from the unknown regions of the Antarctic land.
It was broadcast to Fortnite with an army of thousands of
Emperor penguins and die glock.
Look, I don't actually know the message reads probably.
At last, the work of generations is complete.
The Great Era is corrected.
The day of victory is at hand.
Day of revenge the day of the Reich and the threat was easily defeated by a person on
Twitter after some problematic tweets resurface.
And after some kid reported his epic store account,
Emperor penguins resolved, revolted.
Outraged by the now resurfaced tweets.
Quoting, we couldn't believe that he liked pineapple on pizza with his plans
thwarted.
You know, Spencer stays arguing on Twitter and sending letters to Epic Games trying to
get his account back.
Um, good rack.
Is it scientifically possible to create a good rack?
The answer at the moment is no.
Well, that's disappointing.
Yeah, I don't know if I, I don't know if I agree with that at all.
What a tepid consensus.
Yeah, um, but I guess that's what we'll have to accept from now.
I think this one deserves to be reposted.
Just appreciate the art.
It's amazing.
I want that to bring my bedroom hanging over my bed.
So I quit sitting on a cliff and
get a little over
as he can eat no falling down.
Yeah, he's slowly pulling just to drop.
I need that milk.
It's a spooky drawing of me.
Like the acne scars on his face are so shaded.
And those teeth, when you get them caught into each other, it's gonna be awkward.
But I don't think you're basically just intellectual Slender Man.
Yeah.
Does Slender Man have the gas mask?
No, which means he's really just a copy of me, a bad copy.
That's how that works.
That's true.
Yeah.
This is a rendition of Chud Skywalker.
I'm Chud Skywalker.
Chud is an awfully large sounding.
Look at that light.
My mom gave me this light.
Perpetually out of breath and hungry.
I don't know if you've seen this ranks.
It's suggestive.
It's terrifying.
Your thoughts.
What the fuck?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
What is this?
Jay is looking ripped, but Rhino is.
Jay said, oh yeah, because Jay said his fursona would be a rhino because he's got big tits.
Oh my god.
This scares me.
Twist.
That was actually on Rags Is Fur Affinity account.
What is this?
What is it?
Rags drew it.
I definitely didn't.
Don't you put this on me.
Hey, Ray, that looks just like Ray.
Do you like how the Emperor cloak doesn't make it around his body at all?
She's just like, oh.
Oh yeah, there he is.
He's surrounded by sugar crystals.
He grabs a bite on them.
So these ones are going to be back in back in time.
Now those are all those are all up to date memes.
I don't know if you guys are aware, but a remarkable Republican in
Chad had a debate.
It went as well as this image sort of implies.
Just to miss that.
That part was worth clipping.
I think you know castles are full.
What castles are for.
It was it was the silence from R2 after that.
This the pauses where he's thinking almost like for the first time, you know.
It's a brand new experience.
Wonderful.
I can't remember who showed this one already, but it's just funny.
He got Goodbye Wolfstream.
Then it moves into covering TLJ naturally and total the memes that
shad destroying remarkable Republican on Game of Thrones.
Like eventually just is the thing that happens.
Yep.
Whenever I see like the red star eyes over any character, I always,
I don't know if it's just me chat, but I always think of the.
Yeah.
The face on the bottom.
Yeah.
How much he doesn't like carrots.
It just doesn't like carrots, man.
It's back.
They're cooked.
They become sentient and eat you.
It's horrifying.
That explains a lot.
This is some is the deepest Lord.
Oh, this is the guy that we covered with with with wolf.
That is the guy's TLJ because that was his avatar.
Oh yeah, Daryl.
Yep.
Look at this.
Fucking confusing as crap.
It makes no sense.
Can I just say, by the way, because I was messaging this to Mahler at the time,
that Star Wars video that narrow made was not the best.
But all of his other videos are like gold.
Like he does a lot of stuff on like Resident Evil and Zelda.
He's he's actually a very good YouTuber.
That was actually just the one video he made that was contentious.
So definitely go check him out.
He's one of my favorite YouTubers.
There you go, guys.
Confirmation from Chase himself.
Hopefully we'll cover him in the future of the fap in a way that's a little more different than.
Yeah, I'd love to have him on here because he's just a very intelligent,
very hardworking, clever dude.
Now that's something I didn't think would pop up.
So I got another one.
I can't you know, if this isn't the actual definition, what can I do?
Well, from Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English
to not do something you've promised to do, such as releasing the TFA critique consistently in 2019.
I didn't know that's how they defined it, but I mean, yeah.
Who is Bill Beto Bagaroni?
Wow, that's the Bilbo bag and stuff that goes back to like
before you found proto episode.
Yeah, the proto episode.
I like the chat being a character in this again.
I always like this.
I enjoy having the chat as a character.
Always present, always watching, always commenting.
I can't help but feel like Jay is hiding something under that hat.
Oh, yeah.
This is interesting.
We got Lawful Good being the dawn, naturally.
Lawful Evil being TRO.
All right.
Yeah, I suppose I can pick Lawful Neutral being ER.
How do you feel about that?
Lawful Neutral.
Feels neutral about it.
I sort of see that.
True Neutral being James, James Moore.
All right.
Neutral Good being me and Chaotic Good being Rags.
I'm okay with this.
Yeah, I think that's pretty nifty.
Neutral Evil is Bud Day Bat.
I think that's the most fitting of all of them is Neutral Evil.
The Alta Neutral.
Yeah.
Interesting selection.
How many more fucking eFaps do I have to get on
before you fuckers include me in some fan art?
17 more.
Pull that off.
Sorry.
Just remember, there's more there's more eFAT memes
of Remarkable Republican than you.
Might not be a bad thing.
Ballads of the Jabbai.
That's a good one.
I like that.
You're supposed to.
Look at all the look at all there's Bilbo there.
There's there's Stinky or whatever it is from the Star Wars Holiday Special.
There's another one, the Madea Rebellion.
Holy shit, Jar Jar, the Madea Rebellion.
And
diabetes got the force.
Oh, man, these are awesome.
Yeah, man.
It's so good.
Top notch work.
I want to see these movies.
Oh, we got one more as well.
Oh, my.
This is the order of the Jabbai alternative, perhaps.
A movie.
Lee Bob's got his four.
They gave Lee an eye patch like.
And Jabb is front and center, as he should be.
Yes.
Can we address that movie cinema?
Robert looks like a thumb, like just a giant thumb.
Well, he and Monday, Matt, both kind of look like thumbs.
Interesting.
True.
Thumb life.
Don't underwrite it.
How about that thumb life?
Hashtag thumb life.
Oh, so this was about R2, as he's lovingly called,
said that if people have multiple interpretations of chivalry,
he was like, what are they?
Postmodernist nights, which was a riot to listen to.
Yeah.
Shahad was, I think he was like me at that moment.
He was like, wait, what?
We're like trying to piece together like that.
Stour was out of left field then.
Sir Galahad wishes to make himself available to your
Highness's nightly order, but being a postmodern night,
he must first present a list of concerns.
Number one, will nights of non-Christian religions
be permitted in your Highness's service?
Will nights who do not find the Holy Grail
receive a consolation prize?
Three, what efforts will be made to address
the lopsided gender balance of this order?
Will there be a quota of dabsles rescued
to princes rescued for nights?
Will the king support environmentally
sustainable farming among his serfs?
Has the crown investigated the problems
of a sword from pod-based rulership model
and compared to more decentralized government policy?
Seven, have you considered that our nights of hours
might not empower us beat the Mongols in an open battle?
Oh yeah, that came up as well.
Are those children or dwarves serving you food
in the middle of the table?
Is this the result of an outreach program?
The employment of little people in your kingdom?
Well, this is what happens when you let
the postmodernist nights in.
Start getting all these rules.
Oh hey, I forgot movie bob memes,
even though these are from a different episode.
Yay!
He has an odd face.
He does.
He really does.
It doesn't help that you never see his eyes.
Did we not?
Oh, does he always wear shades?
I haven't actually thought about that.
Yeah, he's like fucking Albert Wesker.
Like you knock him off,
it's just gonna be like a red glow.
Oh well, yeah, that poster we were just looking at,
the one when you say he looks like a thumb,
that's probably, that's where you can see his eyes, yeah.
If a mere mortal could gaze upon his face, it blind us.
Yeah, he's doing it for our protection.
So generous.
He is a generous god.
Yeah, I haven't seen Rango.
So this is referencing, right?
Rango's great.
Yeah, I hear good things.
I hear good things.
TLJDefed does say Rise of Skywalker shit that we're helping.
They're like, wait, what?
Movie bob over there.
It's like this rope's confusing.
Good meme.
The pay follower of mere fighting.
What seems to be the problem?
The Dada's a false god.
That efap chat punch the pay for.
Wait, I'm sorry.
Maybe I'm dumb.
What is pay for?
Pay for is the bizarro efap, essentially.
Oh, okay.
Oh my god.
It's terrifying.
Oh, that is terrifying.
How is one of them okay?
I'm scared.
I've got to say, if Jay was in the, like he is in the upper right,
I'd like Jay a lot more.
This is a series of images representing chat kicking Jay.
Surely going to be very happy to see it.
His face looks weird.
Hitler false ghost explained.
They just got six million views.
Why is there a Patreon symbol there as well?
What's the old symbol?
Actually, they updated.
Hitler's ghost explain is just so funny.
And the directors of Star Trek.
Shark bitch and lava head.
Smaller heroes just as retarded.
Oh,
yeah.
We could all learn a thing or two from Hitler.
Hitler had some ideas.
Yeah.
Jay is in chat reacting to the cat titties meme with confusion.
I feel like he should understand it immediately.
Oh, gee, you don't know.
Hi, y'all.
Your brother is awesome.
What the fuck?
He's an abstract meme.
1.2 billion likes.
Wasn't that an old pitbull tweet?
Possibly.
I don't know.
I really know where all of this comes from.
You remember when Chad said his nine year old felt like they didn't understand how this worked?
When a nine year old is calling out your bullshit.
Perfectly balanced.
It's pretty crazy.
Well, 1,000, 1,200 votes, even.
Really?
How much money are we on how to get the movie Bob domain?
I don't know.
There's not an active counter for like the one dollars.
But how much how much is it posted?
Five hundred.
I'm sure we can get there.
Yeah.
No story ever started with a glass of milk.
What do you feel?
How does J feel about that?
Jeez.
There's no reason not to milk grind this.
If we do get the movie Bob domain, what will we use it for?
Like the website redirect?
Oh, that's actually I would rather just give the 500 to.
You have to be like as a donation instead of fucking.
Yeah, that makes more sense, right?
I'd be done with that.
Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, sure.
Maybe if we raise a thousand, we can do both.
Oh, my God.
Dfap Emmy and movie Bob dot com.
Yeah.
Can you imagine?
This is no one man should have all that power.
Toot sandwich versus.
Giant douche.
That's it, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kind of hard to figure out which one is the worst.
I feel like we had a couple of look at this graph memes,
but I'm not going to get tired of them.
That's a good news of Kylo's fucking soggy stage of democracy.
Soggy Kylo.
What is this?
He's lips are pursed.
What is happening here?
Oh, my God.
Look at you.
Hey, what happened?
We could go away.
Make it go away.
Hey, look at yourself.
Died for our sentence.
Oh, I just saw the sin sins.
Let's see if they ever sin sins.
The best.
Is this a real comic?
I think so.
Sure.
They just put Patrick's brow table on it,
because oh, my God.
But OK, yeah, but yes, very, very good.
Very accurate.
Oh, look, we've got even more balanced memes.
Yeah, it's just a shoot, unfortunately.
Yeah, here's the original.
I just found it.
Oh, she just says I'm shy.
It says I'm Ray.
Oh, right, right.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, I can.
Yeah, it's pretty much.
Yeah, it's hard.
Just in a graph.
Yes, that graph did hurt.
Yes, it did.
See the balance memes.
I can't get enough.
That high res render of his face smiling.
He looks like what Bubba would be in prison.
You know, very happy to see you.
This is unconscionable.
I don't know how we have people snap this shot,
but he's taking in stride, though.
Yeah, he's he knew he needed it.
He's a champ.
The density of my plot protects me.
I need between one and two weeks at the fastest.
OK, to make this next video.
All right, guys.
All right.
I'm going to keep getting questions about it.
I know it.
I like this meme.
Beguidius would be ashamed of our society.
Change my life.
I do not disagree.
This is one of the way his name is pronounced.
Ryan made the worst stars with JJ.
Allow us to enter.
He really did try it out.
Do him.
He really did.
He gave it his all.
I sure as hell get that idea.
You're making the plot of a previous movie.
See, and I I stand by.
I don't know that there's any Star Wars movie
that has the same plot as Rise of Skywalker's insane plot.
Oh, my God.
Oh, wait.
I want to ask.
I get this.
Was that the only person that.
It's the room.
Was I the only person that thought that Ray looked like exceptionally
more dolled up in this movie than she did in the prior movies?
Hmm.
Wait, who?
Sorry, Ray, she looked a little bit more dolled up like her face
looked a lot more bare in the two previous movies.
Maybe just my imagination.
I guess I'd have to see comparisons, but I don't remember really.
I definitely know it's a lot more like glamour shots.
Yes, he did, Bob.
I don't know the Spanish crew observe the movie Blob 2019.
Why see the amount of effort that would have got into making that creature?
It was barely in the film.
It was like a throwaway gag.
It's just weird.
It's like, all right.
I mean, with Disney's budget, like who the fuck.
And what's it going to do?
It doesn't have any fucking arms.
It has telekinesis rags.
Uses the force.
Oh, my God.
Can someone translate this?
Chase, you can do it.
Condo.
Condo dio da.
Just means, uh, I'm Dio.
Gosh, that's all disgusting.
Or like it was me, Dio.
One of the two.
Look at the way the skywalk is scribbled on.
Sadest town.
That's what happens.
Wait, is that a fucking paper's place reference?
Yes, that's a paper's place, yeah.
Oh, this is my British passport.
Oh, I get it.
This is the teeth, isn't it?
This is true cinema.
I told you you can tell they wrote Skywalker
on that previous meme with like a mouse.
I don't want to make of this.
This is face in the last panel.
I am going to have a reference to Sammy in in my my next video.
Frickin fricks.
You frickin fricks.
He looks like Edna Mode from Incredibles.
He does.
I don't.
So Jar Jar is attacking Claude.
Then he can't decide on why.
But ultimately, do we need to know why?
No, we don't.
His Claude is very powerful.
Well, you find another meme on air mine.
Make a new story.
Just take someone else's story.
Think about it.
It's all the Jojo fans in chat.
Am I bad person for being the most upset?
About Iggy at the end of part part three.
You probably are.
Yeah, probably.
Iggy is a dog character.
Oh, oh, yeah.
So that sounds nice.
Strongest character in the entire show.
Okay, we need some deciphering here.
There's a reference to how they don't know which way is down.
I just see a swastika.
Well, I guess it's like he doesn't.
He's trying to signal with directions.
Like on a bicycle, you signal directions,
but they're clearly confused as to what the directions are.
And they like.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
This meme again.
But different different words.
Not having original idea.
What's the original format of that meme?
I'm really curious.
Chief, Force Dyad need you do not.
Ketamine you must find.
What is this a reference to?
We've got too many beams now.
It's really hard to catalog and understand them.
Doesn't ketamine like horse tranquilizer?
There's going to be contact for this in one of the 12 hour streams.
I feel my brain growing by the minute every time I see one again.
Scratch my ass, Kyle.
If you don't, the Joker will win.
Like what is an old meme.
Surrealist memes.
Who we're at.
It's so deep and meaningful.
Really quickly.
Someone did a super chat and said, tell mauler to watch Jojo.
Watch Jojo.
Oh, what are we going to do?
Are you going to kill me?
Mm hmm.
Yeah, right.
Yes.
Look at every picture of downward thrust.
He just looks so uninfished.
He's so disappointed in all of them.
He explained it.
He's like, this is how human look.
Yes.
You'd be like, yes.
It looks like his mugshot kind.
It's like a Facebook executive.
You kill those carrots.
Hard to swallow pills.
The message of TROS is to kill an entire family
so you can take their neighbors your own.
Not wrong.
Oh, so you know how Kylo forgives himself with his own memory.
I'm a good boy now.
Oh, was there a meme about the emperor shitting himself
and Kylo had to do something about it?
I just don't remember.
No, Kylo, I'm shitting myself.
Does it hurt?
Does it hurt?
Where does the does it hurt meme come from?
That's not even present for that.
That was the Star Wars leak stream.
You know, this isn't DFAP specific necessarily,
but it still works just fine.
Also, I love that previous the does it hurt image
that was drawn of you more.
That's a nice, very angular version of your avatar.
I believe that's actually in the selection,
the original version.
So we'll get to that.
We're halfway through.
I need to do it myself.
This is the worst timeline that we live in.
Oh, no.
Jar Jar.
These are his children.
Oh my gosh.
Okay, there definitely was memes about Palpatine pooping.
What in the world?
The Shutterstock sells it.
Batman, what about themes of method artists?
Shut up, you bats.
Fereggy tooth sharpener.
Is that like a Star Trek thing then?
Yeah.
Well, there you go.
Raise a Trekkie.
That image of her with the teeth.
Is that like based on something?
Yeah, it's a movie.
It's a movie.
It's like a vision.
I don't know what to make of that one.
Shout out.
I need the force.
So I think this is some kind of strange amalgamation
of when I was discussing the Digimon theme
and the Isle of Man flag.
I don't know what else.
Horrible.
Terrifying.
Imagine that walking at you.
So you can't keep doing this,
but which way is down?
Was there a movie about how they couldn't poop
because they didn't know which way was down?
What's going on here?
Watching looking at eFap memes after the fact
is like deciphering glyphs.
Don't really know what the conversation
could have definitely been.
Oh yeah, because
Shad was like it wouldn't work
because she actually uses the double-ended
lightsaber flip function to lock
an enemy lightsaber into it.
There's something Shad had actually talked about.
Subjectivity Slayer.
Man, look at all those sponsorships.
You got Shad, Boxes, CJ, Jeb,
Brigidious, Star Wars.
Oh, they have the original Papyrus
for Brigidious as well.
Very nice.
Jack Daniels there.
Themes.
The regs look at Women Apex Homo Epic.
Podcasts.
You got the tally chart as well.
Big, Brigidious, and Papyrus one.
I'm not sure if you already said that.
That's the way it was originally spelled.
That's its original form.
That is the correct way to spell Brigidious.
The toxic, brood-stopping bastards
were getting to their themes.
So desperate.
In Jeb, we trust.
I would buy the shit out of these coins.
Please clap.
Yeah, that's the original version, Chase.
That's how she looks in the movie.
I may have gone too far.
I thought it was making the...
I don't remember seeing that in the movie.
It's when she...
You blinky missed it.
She's getting the wayfinder
in the fucking Palpatine's bathroom
and she just turns up and has a Force Vision.
And then she's like...
It's so weird.
It's really weird.
Scary Bilbo teeth.
I... ironically...
Unironically, I want a Jeb coin like that.
Truth is, it was all Reylo from the start.
That's a good meme.
We needed this for Scary Bilbo teeth, god dang.
Terrified.
That part of the fucking...
The movie scared the shit out of me.
Yeah, man.
He reacted that way to the ring.
Yeah.
Was the See It Dude originally part of the movie poster?
The what dude? Sorry.
At the underneath her face, it says,
See It Dude.
Like, as a pun.
Oh shit.
I don't know, maybe.
Well, there should be a comma after it, so...
I don't know.
Thinking emoji.
Sith our friend, not food.
But I will consume your essence.
Am I shooting at Ray or am I shooting at the joke?
What's the name of that fucking old like...
That old clay fucking like toy?
Or not clay toy, but he had like the squishy...
Stretch Armstrong.
Why do you have Stretch Armstrong?
I'm the lawn man.
My arms could go as many plays as I want.
There's no limits.
Joker's just getting the fuck out of there.
Taking the McMuffins very literally.
I know we needed to find the Emperor, but I haven't had breakfast.
Oh my goodness.
I proceed with caution to this one.
Oh my god.
If anyone dismisses this whole efap as like,
Why did I spend eight plus hours watching your videos?
Take a screenshot of Bob Swolo and just us reacting to it.
That's terrifying.
Wouldn't want to run into Bob Swolo in a dark alley.
Look at his tits.
10,000 death star destroyers literally just the fucking ground.
Downness fucks you up completely.
Oh, I thought I couldn't even remove Getty images.
They just kept it in there.
That adds substance to the meme.
But yeah, there's like a young Admiral Akbar fish thing in the movie.
It's like, oh, hey.
Yeah, I saw that.
It freaked me out.
Do you think it's like him being like Akbar is alive in spirit still?
Yeah, but he's dead for reals.
Who shot first?
I guess it would be JJ.
No, it was Ryan who shot first.
Really though?
I mean, also,
JJ.
Well, I mean, if it's between the two of them,
you'll be JJ.
But JJ wasn't responding to anything Ryan did with his first movie.
He still shot first.
He still shit.
At no.
Right.
Did Ryan not like shit all over JJ?
I don't know.
They're both crap.
It's JJ shot.
Ryan shot back.
JJ shot again.
And they all they both missed each other.
They just hit Star Wars over and over again.
Yep.
What is that last picture of?
Is that him getting blown away by the light?
Oh, is that actually from the movie?
Lightening explosion.
Looks like it.
Yeah.
His skin was like,
blurping off and stuff.
And he just kept going.
I want to add very quickly.
Very quickly.
ER.
Was there ever an idea you had for a video that you thought about pulling it off,
but it would just be like too long and difficult to pull off or too exhausting to edit?
Yeah, the one I'm doing right now.
Always plans gate.
I've been working on for about a year.
Jeez.
That sounds like an incredible case of burnout.
A little bit.
It's going to be an incredible video once it's done,
because you've been working on it for years.
Well, why not both?
Why'd you have to be so negative, Chase?
Jesus.
Five, you met me.
Like it was just car crash and both essentially,
characters are upset at one another the other.
I'm glad Rage Comics died an abrupt death.
Two images are going to wobble on.
Coupled in infamy.
This picture's scary.
I can't remember why this is a thing, but it is.
Dammit, Hitler.
You spoke to me.
I was going to say, I'm not talking to Hitler.
I'm a spy.
It's such an awkward moment in the movie.
I am a spy.
I'm a spy.
I'm the spy.
He just turns around so earnestly and says it.
I'm a spy.
He's like, oh.
After that scene, he was like nailed.
Yeah, Amy.
You never would have thought that we'd be getting to fundamentals like this.
Like, oh, so stupid.
They don't even know which way is up.
You'd be like, that's dumb.
No, no.
No, no.
Question, actually.
The Jedi mind trick that they use where they're just like,
oh, thank goodness you're here.
Do they utilize that often?
Not often enough, but pretty often.
It's pretty fun.
I thought the most consistent character is going to be like an inanimate object,
like that door over there.
What's his name?
My family name is Revolving, but I took my husband's name after I married him.
He was called John.
Is that Buck?
Buck?
Beck.
Bruce, though some people make fun of me for being called.
Backdoor?
Backdoor.
I remember that.
That was funny.
Eek door.
He's the characters in that.
I love you, but make your meme higher than 200 pixels.
This might not have been the fault.
Maybe this is something.
They might have sent a family name is revolving, but I took my husband's name
after I married him.
He was called John.
Back, though some people make fun of me for being called back door.
I rather like it.
And ever since John died when he was blown up with the first Death Star,
it's all I have left to remind me of him.
Yeah.
Spooky, spooky images, cursed images.
I am a Skywalker.
This is a Pikachu one.
Like I'm healing.
This is a bad day.
I mean, it worked out pretty well.
Except the force Band-Aid.
That was one of my favorite parts of it.
It's going to be in the video.
But when Shad was explaining the like everything wrong with healing
and then like his like reaching toward the end of his rant,
he's like when Kylo uses it, he just dies.
He just dies.
You talk about this.
I mean, this works for this stream to the whole like irredeemable
piss and becoming a good person gets into whatever.
I don't know.
I like it regardless.
Sorry.
Yeah, he's redeemed.
Oh, here we go.
This is more reference to the Shad one.
Yeah, healing time.
Ray finds it pretty easy.
Kylo though, straight up dies.
None to worry about, man.
Nobody expects the Knights of Rand.
That must have been so frustrating for JJ to have watched this.
He was like, he didn't do anything with them.
And Ryan was like, didn't have time.
They weren't even in.
But you went to came to a fight.
Didn't have time.
They didn't have time.
Sword like weapon.
Shad really didn't like the force healing.
Naturally.
See even more balanced memes.
This is what I love.
I think you posted this one before.
I just didn't show it on the screen yet.
It's close to one that I posted.
Do I actually have it?
Did I actually save it to my meme folder?
Because it was funny.
I like how it's so feathered that like Hitler's head is mostly gone.
Huh?
Shitty video essay tisms.
There you go, Rex.
Essentially canon.
Dole.
It's always character.
Dole is a new character.
Dole is a neutral character.
Would like to help anyone get from one room to another.
I like Dole.
Yeah, Dole's my favorite.
Dole is great.
Imagine your third movie being the worst in your trilogy.
This meme made by the revenge of the Sith gang.
More door memes.
The Sith gang.
Door watching the twin suns.
Door goes on an epic journey.
Oh, man.
You've got to see the comic of a door.
And door doors, Skywalker.
Now the comparisons are getting so close onto Mooj.
Oh, my God.
That's oh, wow.
There's so many of the same picture.
It's a good format.
He's a very good one.
He could have put these in the whole section.
The fucking.
The fact that that one was like shittily cobbled together makes it so much better.
Yeah.
Just like layered teeth, the top teeth.
Hashtag missed opportunities.
Flexing.
Based Claude.
I want to see.
I want to see literally anyone holding a fucking lightsaber and flexing at the same time.
You're a little McClunky thing.
That's so weird.
Like Rito just says McClunky in the like streamable available version of episode four.
Now, I know that's a Lucas change.
I don't know.
OK, says McClunky before he shoots him, I don't know what to say, McClunky.
So this is terrifying.
Oh, my God.
That is fucking terrible.
He's a Christmas horrifying gremlin.
I'm coming to give you your presents.
Now, like, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's not creepy.
The back is one with him.
No, I don't want your present.
And see, you want to clean your eyes.
You want to bleach him from that.
So you see this and you're like, oh, oh.
But that's just a picture of a movie, Bob.
Again, you know, it's we can improve it with this.
What does the Emperor mean?
You need to play Fortnite to know.
What does the Emperor mean?
So I just have the memes where they're competing to make the worst Star Wars film.
It's like, mine's worst.
Why is it so that there's no picture of either of them?
It doesn't have like a shit eating media grin.
Go keep that smile.
Emperor Palpatine, how are you life?
Fortnite is a pathway to many abilities.
I'm considered unnatural.
I feel like we understand entirely what this image is.
Yes.
I don't know.
Is this a reference to the the WIM Snake thing?
I don't know.
I'm not even sure where I got this from.
I don't really know what that is.
All right.
You know, I'm pretty sure this is an anime reference of some kind.
I don't even know that one.
Unlimited final solution.
Fates stay unlimited.
Is that it?
Yep.
Thought so.
Freaking nerds.
I haven't even seen it.
I just know that.
Caught they massacrated my sheave.
Guys, can I get a seven in chat if we should all do a stream where
we just show mauler popular anime?
They're all going to do it because they all like it.
I know I just want to influence them.
I just want to see the number of pop up that I asked to have their emotions
because that's probably not going to happen.
And now they're all going to never get it.
That's actually not a bad meme.
12 hours streaming.
11 barriers blocking.
Tens dons are smiling.
Nine sword like weapons.
Eight rhinos milking.
Seven mess is mingling.
Six memes are sharing.
Five votes for Jeb.
Wow.
Long men bad.
Three n words.
Two hellos to rags.
And a J that was kicked from the stream.
That was beautiful.
That was very nice.
That's when I feel ready for Christmas.
Yes.
Speak to images of JJ Abrams writing The Rise of Skywalker.
Had such a good idea.
Just got to write this down.
He's like, that's pretty good.
And a nice and natural meme.
Execute Efap, 56.
Did it went without a hitch?
They're mainstreaming now.
Oh, because of the view count.
What is it to be mainstream on a live count?
What do you reckon, guys?
What count do you have to crack in order to become viable by Disney?
That's what it means to be mainstream now.
Ah, my god.
I don't know.
We got to negotiate on our price.
$200,000.
I think this was among our demands, our movie bob.com.
Yeah.
I think this is us being like, she's like chilling out of the Jedi.
Like, get up and do something.
Like, hmm.
He's supposed to like, mace windu.
Probably.
Yeah, yeah, that's probably mace windu.
Yeah, you're right.
I can't remember.
Did we show this already?
It's in my selection.
We colonized Mars with Wellies.
This is all the remarkable Republican ones.
Mother's family stick.
Why are you naked?
I think because the joke was all you need on Mars.
Like, I think Jay said you're Steve and Wellies.
He was like, I don't know what Wellies are.
He didn't know.
The HMS Luke.
Can I just say, seeing the wolf and booties is like the most wholesome thing ever.
Yeah.
It's the cutest shit.
Good rap.
Yes.
It's how I survived the Death Star.
Real shit.
Real shit.
Disney police break again to E-Fap.
Give them a few years, maybe one day.
That's how it'll go.
They'll have to wear Disney brand helmets.
As a Skywalker said, I execute E-Fap 66.
It just lined up that way.
What can I say?
Complete coincidence.
Quinkle dinkle.
You don't have to do anything.
I like this meme.
He's a family of three, more like a family of me.
Wolf, probably.
Yeah, I guess I'm sleeping.
E-R is hiding under my bed.
Rags is in his own bed too.
I guess there's some spooky noises.
I'm sorry, E-Fap.
He's so hungry.
Oh my god.
Is that supposed to be?
Why are you so muscular?
Oh, wow.
I said no, I can't be a super muscular.
You got fucking buff.
And it almost looks like you're flipping them off too.
There's a bright candle.
We're fringy slippers.
Rags is just your problem.
Yeah, Rags wouldn't need a leash.
Very well house trained.
Yeah, pretty loyal.
Fringy and baby drunk Yoda.
I don't know what to make of this.
Are those eyelashes?
Oh my goodness.
Get it off screen, please.
As usual, whenever we want something to clear our eyes,
Movie Bob comes back up.
As the great Mighty Pooh.
Naturally.
Do you get that reference smaller?
I do, Conchas.
Yeah, that was a good game.
There you go.
There's the original version.
I like that a lot.
Good shit.
So sharp.
Here's another one that I have apparently lost.
I'm now going to find.
I was showing rags it earlier.
I really like that one.
The skeleton neck.
I know how to find it
because it'll be in our conversation, I think.
Maybe.
Yes, it is.
All right.
Boop and.
I just have the great Mighty Pooh song stuck in my head.
I really like this one.
This one is really good.
What the hell?
I'm gonna tell right.
That's actually good.
What the hell?
Look, you're upset.
Taking it back.
I believe this guy looking over at you.
I was going to say, like, we got these other characters here.
The objectivity just steaming around him.
I think it killed me watching the movie.
I'm assuming rags went to sleep instead of watching it,
which is a natural choice to make.
I just like these other characters in the background faces.
You got like guys who's unimpressed,
guys thinking about the movie, guys terrified of me.
Possibly Twi would be.
He looks like a drawing from one of those scary stories
to tell him the dark books.
But yeah, that's the meme selection I have available today.
Hold up.
Someone drew.
Someone actually sent me this during the stream.
Let me post it.
It was they put it on.
It was on FA.
So I think it was a thing.
It's Titan Kerberos.
Opening and the little links.
Look at you.
It's pretty nifty.
Also, I'm there.
I'm older.
I ran.
Hi, Jay.
Hi, Jay.
Long long.
Hey, Chase.
Hey, E.R.
Hey, everybody.
We're talking about Star Wars.
Have a good time.
That movie's great.
We love it.
I'm so glad we could bounce right from Joker to this.
I know, right?
Just to perfectly balance.
Really good.
Really terrible.
As all things should be.
So we're about to hit the six hour mark,
which means we can now spend the other half of the stream,
both reading out super chats and catching up on old ones.
If we managed to get that far.
How's everyone feeling?
I already do that.
Doing all right.
Excellent.
I want to ask if we can briefly play this.
It's only a minute 30 and it relates to Star Wars,
including the game.
Is it copyrighted?
No, not at all.
Do you want to?
Okay.
You can find the ones together.
Yeah.
Linked the watch together as well.
I have exited from the watch together.
Oh, if you.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Uh, this is just my personality.
I just show people only plays videos and highlights.
Oh, quirky.
All right.
Yeah.
Just if everyone wants to give themselves the old jump in.
Watch this tismy video.
I never left.
That's not letting me.
It's bringing me to a room's list.
I don't actually have here.
Is doing glad I need.
I need a link to your watch together.
Is this just this just pops up as my rooms in the rooms
that I've been in.
But like rooms that are made not temporary because I know
it's the same link again.
It's just that's what I get when I'm like, copy this to invite people.
Just copy the from the bar up top.
The URL thingy.
Yeah, there was a bar.
That's not working either.
I make a new room, make a new one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Because it's like it starts to load, but then it swaps me back to
my room's page with my account.
Well, yeah, I guess you might have to make another one and send me a link.
That is a new room now.
All right, I feel bad me going to do all this.
Yeah, thanks a lot, dude.
Stupid video.
I know it's all my fault.
I mean, I mean, that's funny.
It better be better be amazing.
I'm sure it will be.
I'm sure it'll be great.
Great.
No, it looks like on the second movie, too.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is.
Yeah, but that didn't come out.
Yeah.
Revenge of the Sith came out in 2004.
I have revenge.
Oh, shit.
But how do you think it was planned?
Is George Lucas a fucking genius?
I want to put Anakin in the second movie.
He is a genius.
I like your impression of George Lucas.
That's what he sounds like.
George, put down the Jar Jar figure.
I want to put my Jar Jar in the bathtub.
George, put the Jar Jar.
Oh, you do it better.
I don't know why I tried.
I want to play with Jar Jar.
No, no, George.
Put Jar Jar down.
Come outside and write some more Star Wars.
In the Jar Jar suit to come back.
I want Jar Jar to kill Han Solo.
I'm going to do it.
Put down the Jar Jar George.
I'm putting it in the script if you make me do that.
Putting a little gun in Jar Jar's little hand.
Is this frozen?
No.
Are you sure?
It's just them waiting on a loading screen.
I think it froze.
No, it's okay.
No, it's okay.
Jar Jar.
Please save us.
It's a Jar Jar.
Duncan's no liking outside.
Still going to be capable of copyright.
But yeah.
Listen to George Lucas impression.
Say Jar Jar is funny as fuck.
Music on Jar Jar Binks.
That was all well with it.
I like getting this.
Mildly worth it.
That's kind of like George stop.
He's like a humble servant.
What a character.
Look up Oni Plays.
Oni Plays George stop.
For the people who are asking for the link.
George stop.
All righty.
I guess that slings us right on over to the super chat section.
Yeah.
And so the way it works right now is I've got all of the ones that me and ranks have missed from.
I think there's a portion of one some from the previous episode.
Then there's a portion of ones that I've split or the ones meant for wolf and the ones meant for
well generally you have questions or whatever.
So like I said they're all getting sorted out.
I'll have more information probably on the next episode about the specifics because obviously
it's December at the end of December.
So everybody's just busy doing all kinds of things.
It's hard to settle up.
But I've got them all.
They've not lost to time.
My plan today is going to be to read through this episode's ones.
If we get to finish them, which I think we can pull off, I will then go into our over our overflow
and we will continue.
So yeah, hope everyone's excited.
I am.
I'm excited for this.
Boy, howdy, me too.
Why would someone said stream is down due to copyright issues?
Why would you say that?
You freaking me out.
Is that true?
Don't do that to me.
Making me check.
The fact that everyone out as chat seems to be fine means that we're probably okay.
Spooky.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's good.
It's gonna be fine.
All right.
Why would you scare me like that?
What's the meme?
Why do you hate fun?
Yeah.
Fun is a concept invented by the Jedi.
A little, a little animation.
Okay.
Yoda, you old sponge.
Yoda, you old sponge.
And when he says that I don't even know how to spell it about dad,
that he goes D E A.
All right.
All right.
Here we go.
Oh, and for people who like, you missed whatever particular meme.
Try the subreddit, the Twitter and the discord.
I can't promise to catch them all.
I do what I can.
I actually, I was telling Rags about this.
I had a big collection of them ready to go.
Uh, and, and plus a couple of extra ones here and there.
And I lost the extra one because they were in tabs because my computer
restarted against my will that I think that's a form of harassment.
When you guys agree, I can probably see.
It can be made.
Yeah.
So, uh, I lost a few that, um, I'm not even a hundred percent sure of
how to recover or which ones I may have lost.
So I will do what I can to keep track of all of the ones and we will get there.
Anyway, here goes, um, here's to a great stream.
Love you guys.
Thank you very much.
Hooray.
Thank you.
What's up.
Great.
Yeah, it's not even over.
The greatness is yet to come complete.
What's up.
Massives, um, we're streaming, streaming about dolls and yeah,
having a good time.
My Ewok.
Hey, look how the fat base is going to have to have to choose between what's up
by Edward, like, like goodbye.
Where was hello.
Where was the Ewok is going to have to take over it now.
I don't know.
Um, as ever coded language.
We are subtle bigotry.
This one just says hello.
So hello back.
Yeah.
Hey, hi.
Merry late Christmas.
Thank you very much.
Merry late Christmas to all and to all a happy year to come.
Right.
And that's how that works.
I think.
Yeah.
I think so.
Based on how many depictions of Maul have tentacles and tentacle light appendages.
I'm convinced Mauler is an Eldritch horror.
Please discuss.
Um, well, let's ask him.
If the baller, are you an Eldritch horror?
Well, uh, define Eldritch horror.
You know, do you identify as an Eldritch horror?
I need to understand the definition of Eldritch horror.
Does it mean I have tentacles?
If so, I guess.
What can I say?
I mean, you play bloodborne.
Eldritch weird and sinister or ghostly.
Okay.
Yeah.
So one of those a horror.
That is that.
Yeah.
Okay.
I agree to all three of those.
Damn you.
Massives.
I'm with my family visiting grandmother right now.
Can't listen to this right now.
That's all right.
It will appear on the moolah channel.
Eventually.
You can check you out with all the facts.
It'll be with the rest.
Mara Jade died for this.
Yeah.
All of the you died so that we can have those sequel movies.
It was so worth it.
Yeah.
Han Solo died for this.
And Luke and Leia.
died for this and Leia and.
Uh, I nearly said chewy.
I was like, no, no, he got resurrected.
It's fine.
Um, howdy rags.
Hey.
Oh my God.
I was just made aware of some merchandise from movie Bob.
That is needless to say horrific.
I think I will collect some more memes while I'm going through these
and then we'll have a little bit of a meme.
A meme break, if you will.
Um, a meme response.
Has anyone mentioned how stupid it is that Palpatine kept the wayfinders out there
instead of taking them back?
You know, the only ways to get to the Sith homeworld.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think we mentioned that.
We mentioned that in our, um, I think our 66 stream.
It was brought up.
Why didn't he have people go get those things so that no one could come to Exegol?
Unless he wanted them to come to Exegol.
It's not even, there's no explanation because you know, it was really bad.
You have this universe that was essentially under the thumb of this empire.
Like, okay.
And one of the greatest weapons ever crash landed on some of these different planets.
Let's just assume, let's be generous.
Just a couple of different plants and it, yeah, it makes sense that it's crashed.
Fine.
Whatever.
So wouldn't a lot of people be like, man, we should plunder the shit out of the, uh,
the fallen death star.
We should go in there and then you go up to the empress room and you're like, oh my god,
let's have a look around.
There's some stuff here we can take.
And then this door opens and you're like, whoa, this go inside.
You find this weird black triangle thing and you're like, what is this?
And you plug it into your computer and you go, oh my God, it's taking me to Exegol.
Like someone could easily accidentally just find it when all their goal was
was to just have a look around some ruins.
Well, no, they wouldn't be able to get through the tism cancer space cancer field.
No, the way finder puts them through it.
Don't know.
Oh, it does.
All right.
Well, maybe Palpatine's plan all along was to have our heroes discover them on Exegol
so that he could defeat them there because he's known for traps.
So Exegol was like a trap in a way that I can't elaborate on, but it was a trap of a kind.
I just like to think that he always assumed Kylo would be the one to find it for some reason.
And then he he like sees someone come in.
He's like, oh, who is it?
And it's just like some some guy, like really average looking dude who's just like, hey,
we can just force lightning him out of the air.
Oh, yeah, it wouldn't be a problem for Palpatine.
I just don't know why he's letting that be the case.
Why not just go get him?
And then you could specifically hand it to Kylo.
I mean, Kylo was there on Exegol.
So I guess his plan panned out like it should have lucky.
I guess the context we're missing is Palpatine got in his head and he was like,
go to Mustafar by by the then you find out that the reason he left them out there was
in case he one day wanted to get people to come to Exegol.
But at that point, you should be like, why not?
There's lots of why nots that I need to ask.
I don't see how to Star Destroyer gets through the space cancer.
I really don't.
That thing gets fucked up by the space cancer every time.
There's no way way finder or not.
Why and why don't you just hyperspace into the past it or can you?
Or I guess you can't anymore.
They change that.
How do the big old ships get through there?
Exactly.
It's not going to happen.
If they say, well, you could just hyperspace around the base cancer.
I just be like, oh, fuck off.
What the hell is this dumb?
It hurts all of the brain really dumb.
What would you do for a Klondike bar?
Can't buy it.
I can't buy it.
Oh, I'd ask politely.
Yeah, I wouldn't.
There's not many things I would do because I don't really care about them.
That's just, you know, I know the meme, but I just I'm sorry.
What would you do for a Klondike bar?
Pull him fat jumbo.
Also, I love how Disney basically stole a ton from the EU after deleting it.
Yeah, just bad photocopies.
A lot of it.
A lot of the ideas.
When I watched episode nine, my theater was full and most of them
clapped when the credits started.
The big tism is spreading too much.
Well, hopefully they all had fun.
Hopefully.
Yeah, that's what's important is that I had fun.
You wouldn't want to not have fun.
Why do people love The Witcher show so much?
At best, it's mediocre.
What's one thing on our list?
We got to see Mauler.
Well, see, my I mean, if you want to watch it like with me or whatever, I'm up for that.
But I don't really care about it at all.
I have no investment in Witcher, but I'll watch it out of curiosity, I suppose.
But I'm kind of in that position.
I know that people want us to talk about it a bit, I guess.
But I've heard mixed things.
I have heard that it's OK.
I don't think I've heard anyone describe it as terrible.
So there's that.
Yeah.
Hi, Nazi Senpai.
That must be referencing.
May I serve you a glass of bleach?
Oh, yes.
Paulin, please.
D.L.J. was worse than Trost, but less contrived.
I think I can agree with that, I think.
This is the discussion of the decades, which is maybe worse.
The amount of luck in the script of The Rise of Skywalker challenges that of like any other
mainstream movie that's very luck based.
I don't know that the Force Awakens used to be probably the title holder of like the most
luck based script.
But after The Rise of Skywalker, like whoof.
So many things just work out the way that they do, despite all odds.
And then they do it to themselves in the thing as well.
Like, damn, you bumped into a a planet celebrating the thing once every 42 years.
How unlucky.
But again, I know it's a reference, but that doesn't make it not ridiculous.
So what happens in the movie?
And then the other one is the whole like, hold over.
What in a million?
It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lucky.
And these are two.
Also, I would say would tell us why it's one in a million, you know.
If you would just, you know what?
That's so funny to think about.
Do you remember that clip we showed with the guy saying, like, yeah, it makes sense in law
that it can totally work out that way.
Did JJ ask that same guy if it's possible?
Why did he say it was possible?
He goes, well, you see, you already got half of my statement.
I said, yes, it's possible, but extremely unlikely.
Like, what in a million?
JJ's like, oh, OK.
Because one of them had just be like, how do you fuck it up?
Like, how doesn't it work?
Yeah, it actually seems really simple.
And he just made it.
That's what I mean.
He took something of Ryan's and people see that as a retcon, right?
I don't I don't disagree with that.
All I'm highlighting is like, it's been made worse instead of improved because now it's like.
Something that she at least for that film, I guess it improves it for other films.
To a degree, the fact that it's an impossibly hard move to do or whatever.
But I don't know.
Also stupid.
Hmm, is it?
It is the day one out of one shot.
That's what we all thought it was.
Apparently not.
Yeah, because it looks like you just hyperspace ram something that
kind of seems really hard to fuck up.
First off, Hi Rags.
Hello.
Secondly, if they make more Star Wars movies after this abortion,
they should be prequels, hopefully about Darth Bane.
So whenever someone says I want them to do this next,
I'd be like, you do get that they destroy everything they touch, right?
I would have thought you wanted to stay away from things you like.
I don't want them anywhere near Star Wars.
Yeah, it's like, what's the next Star Wars movie they should make?
You just go.
Just don't.
You had you had four or five, six chances.
Yeah, you know, and the best you came out with was like a movie that was like.
Efap more like a crap JK.
I love this podcast to death.
Please don't bad.
Oh, got him.
He asked not to be banned, so I guess I won't.
But next, you know, making jokes like that.
Dangerous, dangerous to my favorite long man and also Hi Wags.
Hello.
Oh, I was zero.
All right.
Yeah, makes sense.
All billion dollars, Star Wars plus one point five billion budgets
plus five hundred million ads at least equals six billion dollars.
Box office around five billion.
It sure is a good thing.
Merch sales haven't fallen off a cliff.
I guess that's in reference to how much like they've probably made a profit
off of Star Wars as of this point, but they could have made
so much more is all I would have to say.
So much more if people gave more of a shit gave a shit.
Why do people like Star Wars?
It is objectively a bad film franchise with only three good movies out of 12,
one through nine, Solo, Rogue One and Clone Wars animated.
People are clinging on to the OT forever.
That's how powerfully good those films were in terms of like where they came out.
Cultural significance.
Just your quality.
And you see this to lesser degrees with other stuff like Terminator and Predator
and Alien all have the same thing going on.
It's like why do people still like these films?
They're so crap.
And it's like, well, because the originals were so fucking good.
And those are all dead, basically.
Yep.
Everything keeps dying.
Drask Park just keeps on going.
Then again, that's still that's the interesting thing between all these examples.
Some of them make loads of money.
Some of them make any fucking money.
Some of them are like 50 50.
It's it's a whole selection.
Different because like I know the guy who made Dark Fate
was like didn't get why that film flopped.
It's just like and as much as you can highlight like, oh, well, you fucked up the franchise.
It's like, yeah, but you know, TLJ made buddy like, well,
perhaps it's a little more complicated than all of that.
Why still talking about Christmas?
New Year's is coming out.
Very true.
2020 is coming out.
Thanks for the Watchmen review.
It's the only good thing to come out of that garbage show.
You're welcome.
Please discuss the similarities between Austin Powers, Dr.
Evil and the reincarnated Emperor Palpatine.
Both clones both make silly demands, etc.
Dr. Evil is a clone.
Do you mean he well, he has a clone made.
Being mini me, but he himself is not a clone, right?
I guess it's depending on whether or not you think the emperor in the Death Star in
episode six was a clone or not, which is, I guess, to be interpreted at this point.
Oh, what's your take?
That's so crazy.
Well, I guess he would have to be a clone.
Right?
Because he wouldn't be able to survive the explosion.
I would hope so.
But what if he did because he put himself in a Sith Force bubble?
See, that's what I was originally thinking.
But now that the clone stuff's being brought in, that makes infinitely more sense.
In a really retarded kind of way.
Yeah, because it still fucks up Atticans.
Even kill the real one, you idiot.
He's like, oh, then just what was the Emperor doing this whole time?
And then why does his clone body look all tismy or is it the
that is his original body and has been since the beginning?
Yeah, that'd be stupid.
Then again, he was growing Snoke's to be all fucking fucked up.
I feel like the only reason that's there is because JG just didn't want to leave
Snoke being not explained at all.
He was like, he was a clone.
Fuck off.
I figured that's the only reason for it, because like I lost interest in knowing
what Snoke was even up.
But if there was no reference to Snoke whatsoever in Rise of Skywalker,
I probably wouldn't have given a shit.
I was just we would I would have been like, so what was Snoke?
I guess we'll never find out.
OK, but we guess Ryan that was in Ryan's ballpark and he just didn't do anything with it.
But instead we've got he was a clone made by Palpatine.
He's like, hmm.
All right.
How about that?
And that leaves the door open for us so he can make clones.
Do you make a clone of himself and put it in the Death Star?
It's like I think he deliberately avoided tried to explain any of that.
But the comparisons to Doctor Evil affair in terms of the, you know,
the writing like also powers trying to make jokes while this film is trying to be serious.
And yet they turn out similar.
I don't know.
Guys, maybe he is trying to be serious.
That's depressing.
Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Here's the money.
What's your premium snap?
Cheers.
My premium snap.
As in premium Snapchat?
I don't know.
I don't know what a premium Snapchat is.
I'm assuming you don't have Snapchat.
A joke.
I don't have like you have a there's a lot of like lewd models that will like have you
pay extra money to like access the premium Snapchat where they like send nudes essentially.
So the mean is that you're you're a whore.
All right.
Oh, well, well, I don't have a premium Snapchat.
So if you're looking for me to send you nudes.
Oh, I guess I should use this to say that if there is anyone out there claiming to be
my Snapchat, it's not actually me.
Sorry.
There you go.
I'm sorry.
Looking forward to your rage on TROS and F for Anakin getting his lightsaber buried
in his sworn enemy sand.
Yep.
And yes, the video is being created as we well, not necessarily as we speak right now,
but other times you will be speaking is a good chance.
I will be working on it.
That's yeah.
How's that for crazy?
You know, more well, you know, when is the weeb efap?
No, me and Rags will have to watch like an anime just to have a weeb efap.
You must have me included.
Just avatar guide you.
Avatar.
What is a Chris Stuckman efap?
Why?
I'm waiting for that.
Well, we did the we looked at a short film.
We did that.
Did you did you see a short film?
Oh, wait, the one the one I showed you.
The it was called Notes from Melanie is what I'm talking about.
Oh, no, no, no.
Because we we did a video on that.
Yeah, I saw that one.
It was it was interesting.
They the least looking forward to his other endeavors.
Um, but yeah, Chris Stuckman efap.
I don't know.
We would have to what video of his could we even cover?
Well, I did show you that other short film he did when he was when he was so obviously
emulating Ryan Gosling in Drive.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Um, I think of like, but what like, like, like review stuff rather than one of those
sorts of self made sort of because like this we might we could do that for like an efap
mini sometimes.
Not a terrible idea.
You know what sucks is it's been like a long, like two, three weeks now since we recorded
the a wrinkle in time with with J long bone.
That's still not going to be out for like three months, probably.
Oh, the Doom efap, though, has been clean for two weeks now.
It passed that.
So I'm going to try and put that out soon, possibly in January, and we'll have to see
if you can make it finally through copyright permanently.
And if that one does, then fellowship can come out soon after rags.
Finally, the fellowship of the ring.
Yay, finally.
I was saying a wolf like it's been so long since I've seen that one now that I could
watch it again and it would be fresh.
Like, even though I've watched it before and I edited it,
like, it's just like that's how fucking long it's taken to get it done.
We're in a weird world, to tell you the least.
Get Jay on.
I want to see him kicked.
Oh, my.
I agree.
This one says, yeah, speak the fuck up, you weeb.
Love you all.
Watch Avatar and I'm going to eventually.
That's the one with that chick, right?
Yes, I know that the chick Cora.
She's very intelligent and powerful.
Oh, that's what I need, because now that there's going to be no more Ray,
I need to have Cora take her place.
Absolutely.
Correct.
Um, if you require an escape launch of some kind, Jay Longwood,
would you like to talk about your channel for a little bit before you have to head out?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, my channel's Jay Longbow.
You know, I do reviews and like I said before, right now I'm doing fat woman reactions.
Just got done with one for the crisis on Infinite Earth.
Fuck it.
Oh, God, it's so funny.
I miss that one already on Earth.
Um, um, mash up or whatever the fuck you want to call it,
but it's on hiatus.
So I'm like doing reactions for other stuff, movies and stuff.
I have a Christmas movie reaction I'm coming out with and I'm still doing that.
Finn, uh, like how Disney Star Wars fucked up.
Then I'm still doing a video on that working on that.
Um, and just expect a lot of stuff for me.
Like I said, reviews and reactions, stuff, other stuff about movies, such.
All right.
Well, yeah, there's plenty of things to choose from.
Go and check it out.
It's a channel has been linked in the, in the chat and it's in the description.
Thank you very much for hanging out with us.
Hope you had some fun.
Yes.
Always a delight.
Yes.
I will miss you.
Goodbye.
Might you walk.
Bye guys.
Bye.
Bye everybody.
Bye bye bye.
Thoughts of Dash bullshit being a hot black woman.
I well, I concur.
I enjoy the hot black rendition of Dash bullshit.
Uh, he makes it fine.
Beautiful.
I don't know if he knows about this, but yeah, I'm happy about it.
Yeah, absolutely.
Uh, Knives Out was quite good.
It was in many ways the opposite of TLJ.
That being said, it's disheartening to know that a filmmaker you admire
would deem you a scumbag for divergent ideological views.
Yeah.
Well, that's Hollywood for you.
And we are going to check out Knives Out.
I don't know how long it'll be before it's available,
but we intend to check it out with Critical Drinker.
It's going to be fun.
It's honestly, you're saying that's Hollywood.
It's like that with voice actors too.
Like as, as a voice actor, I try to like follow a big influential
like voice actor people and all of them are just like fucking drunk.
And I'm just like, okay.
All of them just have like the exact identical like political stances.
And I'm just like, kind of want to hear your inspiration.
That's okay.
I'm sure you could really flush out that opinion.
I'm sure that you have.
All right.
Yeah.
Mindfura, Jay Longbone, and Chase.
This'll be great.
Wow.
It didn't include ER in that.
They were referencing Weekend Warrior, obviously.
That's pretty sad.
Breeding Massives.
Cowboy Bebop is best.
That is all.
Also high.
Jeb Zee Nichols.
Jeb Zee Nichols.
Cowboy Bebop is good, but I would say Monster is better.
What's the best one, Chase?
What is the best one?
Best anime ever.
Yeah.
If we'll do a wrong answer.
The troll in me wants to say no game, no life.
The pretty good anime overall.
But I don't know.
I'm going to have to pass it over to...
Yeah, I believe we're asking you, Chase.
Don't try.
I didn't hear the answer.
No, you can't know it until you've answered.
Oh, okay.
Best anime.
Yeah, I'm just going to go with Monster.
All right.
It's not a bad choice to be honest.
Monster versus Steins Gate, then.
Steins Gate is good, but it takes fucking eight episodes to get to the real hook.
So it is good, but it just fucking...
For the longest time, there's a character in there that's a really bulky guy with glasses
and hat hair.
And for the longest time, I would refer to him as Spaz Kid, the hentai artist.
Yeah, so I always think about that.
Who's the best hentai artist?
No wrong answers.
Norosuko is up there.
Norosuko?
Norosuko.
N-O-R-A-S-U-K-O.
I just really like their style.
Dives is pretty good.
D-I-I-V-E-S.
I'm going to generate if you didn't piece that together yet.
Get a Kori in the house in the chat.
It's very good.
Very timely.
Oh yeah, fully cool.
Fully cool.
He's fucking amazing anime.
Six episodes.
Good time.
Great animation.
Great soundtrack.
There you go.
There's your weeb talk.
Jesus.
Fuck out of here.
Didn't want to see you in this place again.
I plan on doing a Long Man video for TROS.
Fun-tisms.
Good for you, sir.
Good luck with the long flisms.
Long flisms.
Waifu is an Eastern martial art, in my opinion.
All right.
Waifu.
Waifu?
Wasn't he a character in Kung Fu Panda?
I'm pretty sure, yeah.
Catching up.
Start my rewatch of episode 50 now.
Oh.
Well, see you soon enough, I suppose,
if you get through the additional...
What is that?
67-17 episodes.
It's lunch.
You got some catching up to do.
Anime Man badge.
Well, enjoy it, though.
We are long men, not animufags.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
What do you think, Mola?
Darth Mola versus Ryan Gon-John and J.J. Bram Kenobi,
the Battle of Ages.
That means I kill Ryan and then J.J. kills me.
I don't like this.
We have to change it.
We have to remaster it.
Make it better.
Make it stronger.
What are your most surprisingly good
and most disappointing movies of 2019?
Minor Joker, probably best of the movie of the year,
and It Chapter 2.
That actually could be mine exactly as well.
Joker surprised me in terms of how good it was,
and It Chapter 2 disappointed me in terms of how poor it was.
Rise of Skywalker was almost like one for one for the leaks,
so it wasn't exactly disappointing, you know?
It wasn't disappointing unless you weigh it against
the potential of what it could have been,
but that's all under the foundation of the last two episodes
and all of Disney's shenanigans that they've done.
I just don't think it was going to work.
I just don't think it was going to work.
Build.
Any other suggestions, folks?
Movies that disappointed you this year
all surprised you in a good way.
Movies that disappointed me?
Is Captain Marvel this year?
Yes, actually.
It's kind of crazy to think that it feels
like a fucking lifetime.
Captain Marvel was this year.
Captain Marvel was fucking awful.
Which is worth Rise of Skywalker or Captain Marvel?
The tough questions.
They're both so damaged, like script-wise.
Oh my goodness.
Well, I'm going to go with Captain Marvel was worse.
That might be purely subjective, though,
without really giving it some thought,
but I would have to consult the elders.
I don't know.
Maybe that's poll worthy.
Yeah, we could try a poll.
Because I legit just do not know.
Because, you know, people might be like,
how is this a hard question?
It's like, well, it fails at everything, Captain Marvel,
like destroys Marvel's world building of what, you know,
there was the characters are terrible.
It doesn't necessarily it ruins fury to a degree.
But then the protagonist is awful like this.
And then the plot is really stupid.
So it's a tough one.
That's a tough tism.
Worth a oh, they're both terrible.
But this is like this in Last Jedi.
They're both just so garbage in their own kind of way.
Yeah, hopefully we don't end up with a draw again.
That's the last thing we need.
If I have chat, you're supposed to tell us how to think.
Okay, my God.
Yep.
It's up to you.
All right.
Spamming the poll now.
Spamming poll now.
Now.
Pulse band.
Stand by for penetration.
I'm going to check it after we read the next one, I guess.
Yeah, let's do it.
I will combat both weekend of the attractive brunette
on their opinions on Jojo if need be.
Part one, four and seven, equality.
The rest is either meh or garbage.
Because you were saying one, someone was saying one is,
wasn't that good.
Chase it, have to field that
because I have no fucking clue.
Say it again.
Parts one, four and seven of Jojo,
equality.
The rest are meh or garbage.
Kill yourself.
Part two.
Part two is really, really, really good
because things are fucking happening constantly
in the entirety of part two.
Yeah.
We are talking about Jojo, right?
I kind of zoned out.
Yeah, yeah.
We're talking about Jojo.
I'm only up to part four, but part one is like obligatory,
like, okay, got to set the stage and see what's going on.
There were a couple cool moments.
Woman's begging a vampire king named Dio.
Like, please don't kill my baby.
And he's like, I'm not going to kill your baby.
He turns into a vampire and she just fucking like rips
her baby apart with her teeth.
And I'm like, it's kind of fucked up.
So that was impressive.
Part two is all really exciting and funny and energetic
and lots of cool fights and interesting twists.
Part three is 48 episodes long and involves a lot of,
I guess you could call it filler, just sort of dumb fights
with very little payoff.
And then I've started part four and I like it significantly more.
It's just more interesting, but there's no bad part of Jojo,
just lesser parts in my opinion.
So yeah, you should still kill yourself though in Minecraft.
Osh.
In Minecraft.
This says the line integral of Diabeto is undefined.
Correct.
That must be like the math way of saying he fat.
I think so.
Because he do be fat.
My mom said TROS feels like Star Wars and I'm just too nitpicky.
I give up.
Turn off brain and shut up, I guess.
Yeah, it feels like Star Wars.
What does it mean to feel like Star Wars anyway?
The music.
Um.
Lightsabers.
Music, the lightsabers.
Yeah, it's definitely a part of it.
Undeniably, that is an element.
It's just a visual.
Oh, I recognize that thing.
That's Star Wars.
That music is Star Wars.
I heard you big fan of new Godzilla film.
Knew it was great.
Now kids will stop bullying me at school.
It hits a lot since I'm 11.
Thank you more like you my hero.
That was cute.
We didn't like the new Godzilla film.
If you're 11.
Yeah, it was actually right.
Properly terrible.
But thank you.
Yeah, but thanks.
But yeah, the Godzilla movie was pretty bad.
Happy New Year, you beautiful massives.
Happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
This just says I'm wet.
Oh, well, yes.
Consider me impressed.
Um, oh, this is kind of relevant to what Chase asked earlier.
Question for ER.
Your videos are very well edited with subtle scenes
from various series and movies.
Do you have some amazing memory or do you work really hard to find them or both?
Uh, it's a mixture of both.
Really, I don't have a really great memory for anything, but
I guess I do in this very specific kind of way.
When it comes to memes, you're God.
Is that what you're saying?
I'm a mean God.
Yeah, that's honestly always really impressive to me
because you'll just see someone like there'll be like a fucking
I forgot his name, but there's a YouTube that does a lot of rust content.
It's like the biggest betrayal or whatever, and it's just really snappily edited.
And there's always a lot of really great, um, there'll be like a, just a random scene
from a movie of someone being like, you lied to me or something like that.
And they'll just paste it in where it fits within the context of the video.
And I'm like, how the fuck do you remember?
Do you just have all these clips sitting around of just random sort of like
reaction clips that you can paste into things?
And it must be incredibly just fatiguing to have to keep track of all that
as like a big compendium and a recallist.
On the fly for a video editing, it must be very, very tiring to edit together.
That's where the skill comes in and the insane memory
or memory as one might say.
Or maybe they just randomly sort of think of a clip in particular
and try to see how they could put it in.
Maybe.
Yeah.
I'm curious like what the process is.
It's more the process that intrigues me.
Um, yeah.
The only non Nazi here.
The rest talk to the rest talks to ER.
I don't know what that means.
If you want Nazis, think about it.
What's this?
ER on my alt right communist podcast.
Yeah, I know.
It's confusing.
It's so weird.
Rags.
Mando was shit from episode one.
Incorrect.
I agree with the correction from Rags.
Yeah, that is.
That is not true.
The show is not crap from episode one.
In fact, we were excited for its potential.
Ghost in the Shell and back.
I know both great and extremely normally friendly
and bastard is just pure gold 90s goodness.
Watch them.
You'll like them.
I've watched very few enemies, but Ghost in the Shell is among them.
And I really, really liked it.
Yeah.
Standalone complex might be among my favorites.
I've ever seen.
You're trying to say something.
I think you and Rags kind of blended.
Oh, just looking up bastard.
I never heard of it.
Him either.
Actually, looking at both bastards.
Yeah, Ghost in the Shell is really good.
I remember when I was a kid, I watched it and I was like,
this fucking it was like the show I'd put on to fall asleep to.
Now that I'm an adult and I can appreciate a lot of the more gray areas.
I'm like, this is really fucking really good.
It does bear repeating, though.
Definitely check out Monster if you're OK with watching like
a 74 episode long anime with very little filler.
It's extremely tense.
Has a really cool blend of like anime and realism.
It takes place in Europe.
I actually show it to my friend who lives in Germany.
He was really, really impressed with all the little details
of how accurate it is to like how Germany actually is
and the culture and food and all the other stuff.
So it's like it's really, really well done.
I hear the guy's done a lot of other great work, too.
Also, Serial Experiments Lane is like a good if you like a very angsty mood.
Kind of show.
It's very like.
Yeah, just just really moody, like even just the OP itself.
Like maximum angst.
Very nostalgic.
I don't really get into that one.
Yeah, it does what it does really well.
And the art style is extremely distinct.
Serial Experiments Lane.
L-A-I-N.
Next question.
At the very least, watch Psychopass.
I love how if we had more like.
There you go.
More like weaves and then the chat.
I don't know what the chaos of discussing a debate anime is.
Like it's probably pretty intense.
Lane is super slow.
Someone commented that.
That's very true.
Yeah, Psychopass is good until like that's boiling anything
until like the main antagonist is out of the picture.
He's like the most compelling part of the entire show
because it's like it's kind of isn't there a movie where it's like
they can go back in time and incarcerate murderers and criminals
before they have the chance to do the crime.
And then that brings up the ethical question of like whether.
When are you old as Minority Report?
Yeah, Minority Report.
I just couldn't remember the name.
But it's kind of like that where it's like there's this fucking gun
that called the Enforcer that can murder people.
I'm sure everyone already knows about Psychopass but.
I have no idea about Psychopass.
It's like you aim this gun called the Enforcer at a bad guy
and they can be it'll like just terminate them
based on like the sort of probability
of how likely they are to go on to commit crimes
and it'll just fucking eviscerate them with like a laser bullet.
And there's this one dude who is just like in the act
of murdering someone at knife point.
They try to pull the gun on him and it's just like.
Quotient's too low.
Safety initiating and it's just like no we fucking murdering someone
and so he can kind of get past the grid essentially.
I didn't like it that much.
The soundtrack was really like samey kind of electro like.
But otherwise it was all right.
Just kind of yeah.
Because when I point my gun at people.
Well we'll get into that another time.
You suggesting the same thing does not happen.
My gun doesn't talk to me and tell me I can't normally
it's the other person screaming no no please my baby but.
Not this guy.
Stop me before.
What about Beastars?
I've heard only good things about Beastars.
Yeah it's like really meme-y and comical.
But I've never seen it.
There's just a single like there's a couple of panels
I saw which is like I thought my it's like a bunch of.
Anthro furry characters.
They're for one of the guys like yeah he's like I thought my son
was going to grow to be like a good citizen.
And then he finds like a picture of like a furry
Anthro lamb girl like about to spread her legs and it's like
but it turns out he's just a degenerate.
Everyone really lapped that up.
Fair.
That's all I know about.
A good way to sell it.
Furies go check it out again.
My dad called Riser Skywalker the new Black Panther
his previously rated worst movie.
Also Daisy played a corpse again full circle is full.
New Black Panther is in worst movie okay well yeah.
I could see someone picking that for their worst movie I suppose.
Um what's your guys's new year's resolution also high regs?
Hello my new year's I don't do resolutions I don't know eat more ass.
There you go yeah I think that's reasonable.
I didn't have one planned myself but uh.
Try to upload faster.
Try oh yeah that's the resolution of mine yeah I guess now that you actually I mean
I wasn't meaning about the other but this yeah I am planning on doing that.
Way more often.
I will try and beat my record for uploads.
This is for 2020 than 2019 okay there you go that's my resolution.
All right EOS your turn.
Hmm six million more.
Six million more.
He's so brave.
Now it's your turn Chase.
Six million more do you want to do a different one?
What about resolutions?
I already said resolutions I already said uh.
If I can upload faster or do you mean something on top?
Oh I thought you said you were saying that to me but okay.
I mean yeah maybe you got a job I don't know have an actual source of income.
You don't have a job you fucking dead weight in society.
I did for a while but uh.
Worthless.
Disgusting.
Despicable.
I was too generous like you got on my job and I got on my co-workers.
I was too good on my job and I made all my co-workers look like shit.
I had really good sales and I guess they just didn't want me there.
I was too happy with my life and that's like why is me miserable like us.
Yeah yeah yeah you're amazing right we get it you're the best sales.
Pretty great.
I want to uh say as well TROS has won it as a significant lead on Captain Marvel.
Really it does.
It is the lesser movie according to efap chat.
I'm not that surprised but they're both pretty awful.
Yeah I think it's a bit of a matter of like most people probably aren't fresh on
just how bad Captain Marvel is maybe um but it's fair enough.
What's your go oh yeah I read that.
Have you seen Monday Matt's cringy episode nine takes?
We were going to check one out today I'm afraid he didn't make the cut though.
He didn't he wasn't good enough to even be he wasn't good enough to be made fun of.
I'll let that sink in.
Maybe we'll check him out next time who knows.
But uh disappointing to say the least Matt disappointed.
I'm convinced that Leonard cheated on Han with a Toydarian and that made Kylo.
Oh yeah that does kind of make sense actually.
Yeah he's got a big nose.
Toydarians are the uh the the the ones that water is yeah.
Yeah.
That makes sense.
I bet they got I bet they got real.
Adam Driver was a marine.
Can you imagine how incompetent he must have been through the through thought?
He must have thought oh sorry can you imagine how incompetent he must have
thought the first order was militarily when given the script.
Oh fuck I can only imagine.
I imagine that they just go like oh well.
That's what a normie would go.
Whatever it's Star Wars it's fine.
They tell themselves that in order to sleep I'm sure.
Yeah that's what they do.
Whatever gets me through this day of filming.
Saw it last night cinema was 90% empty.
Really huh.
Mine was pretty packed.
I mean it's the least earning of the three Star Wars.
Uh for now yeah I think so.
I don't think it's gonna go past the Force Awakens or the Last Jedi.
But um it'll probably get over the billion.
I haven't actually looked up to date with that.
I don't know how it's doing.
I suppose we'll find out.
A very dear friend of mine genuinely liked it.
Plus side he acknowledges the many flaws.
Downside is he thinks uh he this it's sexist to not like Rey
and such people need to be yeeted please help.
Oh yeah well tell him if there's ever a character that he doesn't like
that's a woman then he gonna get yeeted himself.
Like look what happened to Quentin Patrick just right all these people
who are making these takes it's just immediately like uh excuse me.
They hate women and black people.
Kind of disgusting.
I apologize I'm so sorry that our audience had to see that.
Despicable racism presented just so glib.
Disappointing disgusting all of the other words do.
Um critique Eric Butz's review.
Is it would it be worth doing?
He's probably just kind of like.
He's probably just an idiot who claps at anything.
Like yeah I can't imagine him making because the funny thing with the video
essay crowd is they always make like ridiculous points
that they think sound really intelligent.
If we're just dealing with a dude who's like your average audience member
who really loves Star Wars just saying I really love the part where blah blah
blah blah blah and just be like no.
There he goes just leave him be.
Yeah you're great you're just magical.
Um also great lineup today and I'm gonna burn a Christmas tree tomorrow.
She is massive.
Hello wug.
Hello.
Yeah we have a Christmas tree.
Hello oh whoa.
Burn a Christmas tree.
Won't Santa be upset about that?
I don't know how that works.
I always love uh hanging out and talking with the other Massives
but uh they have much more important influential guys
other than me to have on and I completely understand.
Yeah sort of how it turns out I guess.
You were just really disgusting and annoying.
Like no offense.
That wasn't meant personally.
No none.
None taken shower.
Oh my god.
Yeah a digital shower.
But then the voices come back when I when I'm alone in the shower.
Oh are you sure that's not you singing?
I'm sure that's where I do my singing is in the shower.
Yeah the the acoustics are fucking great.
Yeah just start my cock and sing to it.
I sweetly serenade it.
It's you and me buddy.
I can only imagine.
Is that how you charge it?
Prep it for battle.
I I just grant it life for us by singing to it in the shower.
You just look right at it and sing into it.
It's that long you can't slow into it.
Yeah why not I suppose.
You law.
Here's an argument my dad made.
Palpatine is alive.
So he didn't die in return of the Jedi.
So we just assume he escaped.
It doesn't break universe.
It's bad writing.
But it's it's not impossible.
Kind of.
It's just I just love it.
I guess it is possible apparently vaporized twice.
Yeah yeah I live through that if you're evil Sith man.
I think we're reaching to survive planet explosions.
Like how he just was dormant for so long and they're like he's back.
It's like a hound.
Yeah it's all time.
Makes sense if you don't think but just yeah we just need that.
I don't know bonus sort of scene where we see him fold down that shaft and then he
casts a little magical spell to make an explosion and then he's like hey and he gets into a little
pod.
He's like that fucker Vader piece of shit.
I'm fucking out.
He just drives to Exegol and then he's like oh I accidentally clipped my finger on a on a wall.
Ow my hands they're all at his hands.
And when he goes down there someone shines a torch in his eyes and he's like ah my pupils.
Oh no they're God now.
There you go.
Darn this planet is actually kind of shitty.
I hope this doesn't bite me in the ass someday.
Wait if it's hidden how did I find it?
And we will never know.
What bugs you the most about the Mandalorian rags?
What is its most glaring flaw?
As I mentioned before characters consistently over and over and over act contrary to stuff
that they know and they do things that are insanely stupid and make no sense whatsoever
just so a plot can happen.
Mandalorian in the Mandalorian in particular.
Mando he his his competence level is mysterious is the most charitable way I can put it.
He is constantly doing insanely stupid boneheaded things because we want a thing to happen.
We want to have an episode where things starts.
So Mandalorian is now a fucking retard.
Yeah people are very stupid in a lot of parts of the show unfortunately.
It's just Disney Star Wars.
It's just Disney Star Wars.
Finally got my husband addicted to efap.
We've been rewatching from the beginning over Xmas.
Let the fun begin.
Yay.
All right.
I hope you make all the things you can get addicted to efapping.
Yeah not bad.
I like it.
You get thumbs up from me.
Winton let it burn.
Like let Quinton burn or are you telling Quinton to to release his rage?
Quinton should let it burn.
Yeah that's what I'm getting from that.
I don't know.
Or maybe burn his sex doll.
No.
Spinning burns like plastic.
You know it's a really very solid strong flame but it's very dirty.
You don't want to breathe in those fumes.
No no.
I feel bad when you look at Quinton as I have the same name as him.
Oh that's okay.
At least you're not.
Last name isn't reviews.
Yeah.
My favorite TLJ defense is when I asked why they didn't save the slave children.
In a book it said they aren't slaves and could leave if they want.
Bull fucking shit.
They get whipped.
Bull fucking shit.
I have to use a mindset.
They got Stockholm syndrome for the the dude who whips them.
That alien dude is pretty hot.
Oh I hope he whips me today.
No I hope he whips me today.
No me.
They start fighting.
He just whips them all and they're happy and they cry tears of joy.
Not tears of pain and anguish.
Mundane Matt is Diabeto after using his sugar altering powers to disguise himself.
He's a he's a he's a Palpatine clone of Diabeto.
That's why he turned out all fucked up.
Diabeto strikes our heroes with force candy strike.
Unlimited calories.
Unlimited you swell up.
Massive.
Rags is doggo of the year and this movie was ass.
Yay.
I agree on the first part and the second part.
This movie this movie was ass.
Winton is Snoke.
Diabeto is sheave.
Mundane is Hux.
Yeah I mean that pans out I think.
Diabeto being the mastermind of puppeteers at all.
I can see it.
Diabeto mosquito.
And weak fighter are you from Romania?
Oh uh weekend warrior.
Where is weekend warrior from again I forget.
He's from like Indonesia or the Philippines right?
Think so.
Philippines isn't it?
Napa Bend is Indonesia.
Make sure he's a Filipino.
And weekend warrior is from the Philippines I think.
There you go.
I don't know if you've answered this already Mola but what are your reactions to crisis
on Infinite Earth still coming out soon?
Oh yes as soon as I'm done with my rage video I am going to get them sorted out in terms of
getting them past copyright.
That's when you think stop them right now.
Hopefully before Batwoman kicks back up which starts on the 14th of January.
So I got that much time.
Oh my goodness.
Oh my god it's ER.
True.
Correct.
Rags we will poop together with the door open.
No we will not.
We will never poop together with the door open.
Never.
I will poop alone as I always have and as I always shall.
Never I say.
Never.
You can't force me to do such things.
Never shall I poop on the side of another.
You can't force me to do such things.
Suddenly jump into a transatlantic accent.
ER on eFap and a 10 hour decade recap stream by Nick Fuentes.
Today is the highlight holiday gift I need for Christmas season.
Oh there you go.
Ra's Christmas has come true.
Yeah there you go.
Did it.
Winton is that fart bee bubble bass.
Yeah that's what he reminds me of.
Just a fat lumbering buffoon.
How many new long men will be created because of TROS being such a dumpster fire.
It'll be my longest ever so I'll assume you'll have a new army of massives.
Yeah I think so.
All kinds of videos are still gonna be coming out.
We're still only what a week and a half past the movie being released.
So you know this is this is early game for video essays and video takedowns.
And we'll all know I mean me and Rags are just looking forward to that day.
Where we cover the video that says TLJ was ruined by return to return to the sky.
We'll go rise of sky.
Oh there's gonna be there's gonna be plenty of those from all these same people.
I can't believe we've already gone.
Totally not gonna use the same reasons for one and not the other but.
We've already gotten the take from Quinton that
he gave in to racists and that's why Rose did the film.
It's like wow.
I didn't give in to racists that's why I don't make as much money.
I'm not complaining though I'm proud of it.
Imagine you just like met up with JJ like personally Quinton and JJ was like no she's
just a really bad character.
What would Quinton do?
His brain would short circuit.
Just picture he'd be like no you you've been you've been brainwashed by the alt right.
Yes.
Is it a hot take?
No JJ.
Is it a hot take for me to say that I would I would eagerly accept money from white supremacists?
Yeah absolutely if you're a white supremacist out there fucking give me all of your money.
Yeah no I will take that I don't.
I will gladly make sure I would gladly have you be poor so that I can be richer.
Yeah precisely.
It makes sense that you guys would find solidarity with white supremacists.
Wouldn't you wouldn't you be okay robbing white supremacists more than anyone else?
I think Rex said that.
I I wouldn't like no I know I'm not robbing.
No no I mean you said wasn't it you or was it someone else who said
you become richer and they become poorer isn't that the exchange because they give me their money.
Yeah well you would think that that's the thing Quinton would want but Quinton is so
virtuous that um them voluntarily giving him money means that they in some way endorse his work.
I also like the idea like he sees he's got like a live sub count right in front of him and he's
doing a live stream and he puts up middle fingers as fuck Nazis and it goes down by 10 subscribers
and he's like good I just lost 10 Nazis and you find out like one of them was just like no I just
find you annoying.
No no you're just obnoxious like obviously like it's it's the default that you don't like Nazis
using it as a way to virtue signal is kind of like super cheap and pointless.
It's just lazy yeah.
It's like if someone leaves and they're not a Nazi and they tell you like yeah I'm not
a Nazi he'd be like no fuck you you are a Nazi.
It's like oh okay.
Yes I'm a Nazi.
Shout outs to Simple Flips.
Simple Flips.
Simple Flips.
Shout out to that guy.
ER number one sleepy boy.
I jace face che long bone and rags.
Hey hello.
Oh and weak boy and mauler.
Weak boy.
Weak boy.
Asshole.
I mean fuck you man.
Fuck you.
Charge it up.
Long man even though your opinion on the expanse is objectively wrong will you be watching season
four at some point Ashford is the MVP in this season I just didn't enjoy the three seasons
that I saw so I don't really have any reason to keep it going and yeah I don't know I'm
probably gonna try something else you know something different but I'm glad this is the
thing if I was to give like a solid actual breakdown of what I think is wrong with the
expanse I would need to watch it thoroughly again and make loads of notes I just sort of
didn't intend to have a lot to say about it and I if I'm being completely honest with you now I've
forgotten a lot of it like already it's been like half a year and I've already like blanked
out a lot of what I saw on it because I didn't enjoy it like I said but there we are I suppose
I hear the books are very good um yeah books oh yeah is this the one about uh is this the one
ripping off dead space kind of uh kind of I could see how you could relate it I suppose
I remember there being they found necromorphs
of a kind and then they had them attack a station kind of yeah that there are
I would happily say it's not a rip off of dead space but I can see um how you can connect them
sort of thing like it's a weird infection that sort of we animate sort of fucks up dead bodies
with weird things and can kill people oh yeah and they like send it to a station to infect
everybody on purpose and stuff yeah good stuff um er and jay longbone in one stream this is awesome
last hour bubble bass voice still no tiles I don't know what his voice is like
it's been so long I can't really remember myself still no tiles rags strip mine my coal shoot I've
been naughty and only your stocking stuffer can make it nice saying it's coming down that chimney
more or slash er thanks to you both I have drastically raised my standards for stories
thought tfa and tlj were okay not great found just how bad after seeing the feedback from
normie to toxic fan there you go good character arc right there
maula doesn't know spongebob memes you uncultured swine bubble bass is diabeto
in a parallel universe rewatch old spongebob there is efap meme gold there
um I only ever saw a couple of episodes here and there but yeah I've always understood that
spongebob was good shit and then it eventually became bad right like as all shows that go on
for a million years do like I don't I don't know any hardcore spongebob fans to be able to tell me
yeah me neither the old stuff was fine I guess I was never big into it it's just like you know
how like this this happens with Futurama South Park and uh like simpsons like there's this
golden age of episode selection and then it gets worse sort of thing that always seems to be the
case yeah what is that the law of diminishing returns I mean yeah I don't know you guys like
your animu is one how's one piece doing it's been going on for 10 years you tell me one
stopped reading it around uh I can't tell you the last thing it's like I stopped reading I
because I originally read Naruto in one piece and I stopped reading Naruto when they were at
like the forest of death or something like that which was like a big fucking deadly gauntlet
and then I couldn't find the next issue of the manga so I just fell off and now I see like
Shippuden and Boruto and I'm just like whoo god I fucking avoided all that yeah it's a lot
Quinton is rounded if it go ahead I was just gonna say if an anime has to be over 100 episodes
long like I like a lot of things about my hero academia but every episode wastes so much time
and just tries to charm you with the character interactions that it's like I just give me
something compelling I can tell when an anime has to be made to be infinitely serialized
and it's just made for the profit rather than to tell a story get it over with and then move on
like you can just see them oh oh my god I was at hot topic the other day because I had a gift card
oh my god shut the fuck up let me finish I was at hot topic because I had I had a gift card in
my wallet for $45 and I don't remember who gave it to me and so I was like hey girlfriend do you
want to like a free hoodie and she's like sure so we went there there was literally a kid dressed up
as uh icy hot from my hero academia the guy with like the half red half white hair and uh they
were all they all had to be like 15 16 and all of the other kids were referring to this cosplayer
in hot topic as the character's name and I was cringing so fucking hard and then all around
there is like flat brim like 50 cent caps with like fucking uh bakugo and I just reminded myself
I never want to let's bakugo bakugo is like uh he's like the guy with the grenade hand superhero
dude in my hero academia just don't worry about it all right that makes sense very inconsequential
didn't sound very inconsequential
okay move on uh quinter quinton is rounder than ryan what the fuck
um I don't know about that complicated question lots of things more the timeline is getting worse
invite me on efap 146 you massive hi wag
hello oh hello oh timeline's getting worse well um timeline can't possibly get worse batwoman's
protecting it protecting the infinite crisis it's true yeah in batwoman we trust uh quinton
a movie bob would fight each other like walrus over land I want to see a twitter battle between
movie bob and quinton that'd be funny oh I'm down for that um I just want to help the doll and tell
her it's okay I think it was a guy doll was it a guy doll or a girl doll had to be a guy doll
oh yeah that's dumb for us all I mean the doll's fucking him right yeah yeah yeah
he has a system of bullies and leavers and stuff only way that makes sense to me
it is now law that quinton is married to his sex doll
yeah I think we all we all assumed that yeah yeah what a huge step forward for marriage
equality that quinton can marry sex doll um quinton pegs himself with his real doll ray
and her flesh colored lightsaber oh oh man riser skywalker was bad but I always consider
tlj to be worse have fun responding to quinton and his sex doll persona oh he did it was wonderful
my character it embodies who I am I just fucking love how tortured it looks in the corner at all
moments of the video like imagine being a sex doll already terrible imagine being quinton
sex doll have you ever played uh have you ever played uh welcome to the game too it's like a
brutally difficult survival horror kind of like game that takes place on the deep web
really interesting concept um there's like an uh there's like uh I'm not gonna bore you with the
details but it's really cool if you're looking for like one of the most tense survival horror
games ever with a lot of intricate rule sets then it's really really challenging what's it
called welcome to the game too the first game is like really janky it was like clearly a unity
kind of fenaf knockoff almost but welcome to the game too is a lot more uh a lot more depth to it
and uh it's basically you're trying to find a reporter who like got kidnapped and she's
going to be like murdered in a red room on the deep web and you have like
I think it's three real life hours to get to the so it's like you keep getting better and better
and accumulating more money and buying more technology with the money that you get and you
can just get killed by like four things at any given time unless you're careful and you're always
like checking your corners and everything and so it's like as the game progresses the stakes get
higher and higher and higher and you have to find like eight codes to find the red room and then
beat the game but there's one character there's a point why i'm bringing this up i'm sorry it's
taking so long but uh there's a character called the doll maker if you go to his website it like
triggers him and he comes to your door and he just like wheels up like a fucking mannequin woman
up to your door and you get to see her he basically makes like sex stalls out of real women
and he like lops off all their limbs and stuff it's like super dark and disturbing to imagine
being like entrapped in a situation like that go check out welcome the game too it's a good game
that's what i'm trying to say that was worth the payoff yeah
uh maula update on tfa3 infinite tisms joker praise truss rage and all efap movies it's your
content i need it now fap now 8 7 7 fap now hi rags but hello um tfa part three well as rags made
clear several times august 2020 that is the expected delivery date um infinite tisms that
the expected delivery date will be um early to mid january joker praise will be uh later than
probably next year towards the third quarter and the riser skywalker rage will be within
one to two weeks and efap movies will be steadily releasing across that i think 2020 is gonna be a
lot of stuff to do with my channel and efap coming out we will be fine you know 2019 was just tough
to get through all the copyright stuff but um they're all just gonna flow out at once once
uh two towers and doom stop being tismy uh he sounds sad and drunk i assume they're referring
to the sex doll of quintons that would make sense um required himself well yeah maybe both
i don't know i don't assume too much um er is my favorite saucy boy how's life treating you
pretty good saucy boy mm-hmm i'm just the messenger told judge be
saucy uh i've never seen my father more affected by a piece of media than when they faked out chewy's
death give shad shit for not knowing that red is the color with the least energy purple has the most
i didn't know that like did you guys know that purple i'm like oh i'm gonna pretend i did now
that's why i chose the purple oh apparently jj abrams uh he said uh on the relationship between
ray and kylo ren there's as much of a brother and sister thing as there is romantic what
why would why would he say that i don't know i'm looking into the link why is he inviting himself
to be criticized so harshly like so he said he said there's as much of a brother sister thing
or sorry with ray and kylo ren as there is romantic so it's not literally a sexually
romantic kind of thing it's more like they're just bound together in this crazy spiritual way
again felt romantic to me when someone says spiritual i always want to ask them what do you
mean do you even know what that means when you say that word i think that's the word they use
what they don't know what else to say they're like uh spiritual always reminds me of that joke from
i think it was daniel toss where he just says people like to say i'm not religious but i'm
spiritual and he says i'm not honest but you're interesting oh i get it icf i'll ask please clap
not demand a clap you're not jeb imposter um rags valcuria chronicles stole your identity
got a dog just like you with rags as their name as title card during speech copyright claim go
ragnarok yeah the dog ragnarok the the field medic i like it because i like these grades
did you just assume this year's number
no i asked it i asked it listen 2020 is only a sequel to 2019 if you interpret it that way
that is true actually yeah yeah come on guys jebby's not even that pretty considering once
she takes the atrocious atrocious amounts of makeup she had to use men because she's thin skinned
um well i you know what i leave that up to everybody individually how how attractive
they believe her to be who jebby um jebby i just thought her light was overexposed
i just thought that yeah the way the light hit her
face that was just basically an icing of uh what is it called makeup and stuff they just look kind
of it's really weird she's by no means unattractive but i would never i would never dare approach a
woman uh with those opinions and never have like any sort of mutual respect with them that's more
important outline um one thing i noticed no arm slug guy goes flying when the falcon swerves yet
everyone else is fine because art gravity throwing out logic for gags i don't even remember did he
like fall over i don't remember how does he get up when he falls over does he have to like use his
face and put it on the floor and press his feet up what a terrible species um named my
named my dog mauler and my skull on wheels rags oh oh they're changing it up seeing
it's putting the one thing one place i'm just looking at a skull on wheels
um winton sounds like he's dead inside well this is the thing he actually kind of is a little bit
as far as i'm aware he's losing his passion for youtube it's all just the vocal right it's the
constant just sounding like this yeah and the problem with wanting to die bit there's an
element of wanting to die that's affecting him you're like oh like in my old videos i'm like hey
guys welcome to this episode about sonic the hedgehog and then in my new videos i'm just like
today i'm going to review pokemon sword and shield yeah and then people are like
people are like you sound so different i'm like yeah age and debt will do that to you
hey guys welcome to my outlast review

where'd she get you where leah walked past chewbacca to hug a palpatine
i can say that now in my tfa videos yay uh babu frick shouted tada was a real funny
tada hey babu frick is underrated he needs his own disney plus show i would sooner watch the
adventures of babu frick than i would the adventure tico yeah i saw the first 50 minutes
of this movie and even then i walked out when the relo kissed by the blood of christ i couldn't
imagine sitting through this bullshit we did yeah we did we managed it i laughed i giggled
i remember laughing a lot of this movie but looking back i can't remember much of the
actual events that happened even though i knew the leaks well so much happened it's like they
all get mixed up like a blender in your memory yeah just a lot of shit on screen is it bad that
i still enjoyed this movie yes i know you're not a bad person i honestly i enjoyed portions of it
it's just not for yeah the intended reasons i imagine person yeah go see a doctor quiet
er speaks let us hear his psychic powers yeah go go go go watch avatar
that was a super chat about avatar that was the movie with the blue people on pandora
yes uh very very good filming i believe it's er's favorite piece of media that's great
it's like super smart he's huge into james cameron oh yeah we're all looking forward to that that's
going to be the new model universe oh yeah we're canon bending winton running is mundane fat
collecting boulders like what you mean like it's like a lie well like uh i don't know i'm gonna go
ahead and just thumbs up all right uh only real laugh i had was pose wanna fuck face
oh yeah yeah that was kind of just like oh all right is ray the virgin or was she raped
as a child i guess we'll never know but um uncar plot didn't seem like the kind of guy
to follow the rules if you know what i mean seemed like his own kind of dude i guess not
and uh he was played by simon peg who's a known crazyman who uh i believe has actually like say
come out kind of against the i i i can't remember i read something recently as like a quote from him
where he says something negative about the sequel films and i'm just like more of this more honesty
please so uncar plot decided that he would force himself honor or i get it
i don't think anyone else gets it ranks i'm sorry that's a rape joke about star wars everybody
uh hi rags and mola hello hey uh it says fuck mary kill totally spies
oh okay um
let's see let me remind myself of what they look like oh marry marion the red head um marion the
red head uh i'd fuck the red head marry the the black girl and kill the blonde girl um
i'm thinking yeah i'm i'm thinking i'm gonna kill the blonde i'm gonna marry the redhead and i'm
gonna fuck that spicy brown lady damn me and rags kind of like wait for starters they're
like they're 18 right yeah i'm sure all right they also don't they also don't exist so it's
here but it's just you know generally is kind of regard to them clover sam and
oh my gosh what's really weird is that when you when you type in totally spies there's always
this and i went to images just to remember what they look like oh boy and so if you go
across the top they have the suggestions um they have clover sam jerry cartoon blaine samantha
kaitlyn dominique they don't have the brown one they don't have the yellow spy they don't
have her name it's just clover sam into the butler jerry you're right i'm doing that too
what um that is racist jerry alex sam alex is her name yeah so yeah there you go now you now you
know now you know all right you choose as well the efab lore yeah i'm with google i'm putting
alex's her name on the kill list
so alex is the yellow uh yellow suit yeah oh she's the brown chick yeah she gotta go
all right sharing the redhead uh fuck the arian
we did it everyone we did it if diabeto is quinton's father
the quinton's sex doll must be diabeto's daughter-in-law does she get a supervillain name
uh i don't think so it's it's you know supervillains get a supervillain name i don't
know that it's a super it's not even a supervillain it's a victim that poor doll
super victim gotta be saved gonna be a damsel in distress someone find that doll and save
that doll from quinton's cock when was totally spies aired by the way let me check early 2000s
it aired from so there were six seasons of it it was from 2001 was the first episode
you got 18 years on top of uh however old they are there so you know well it says episode like
season six episode 26 it says june of 2013 so i guess there were spaced out no idea went on for
that long totally spies i've never heard of it before apparently there was scrap there was
gonna be a season season seven but the show got canceled so oh wow it was it was basically just
charlie's angels but like cartoon um lani patour of team four star says that because rise of skywalker
retcon stuff from tlj if continuity is important to you you might not like this movie ironic um
how could you like tlj if continuity is important yeah it's just
or tfa true again i feel like continuity at all you really shouldn't be about these sequels
if you like continuity just stop watching things i just just gonna disappoint you
uh support the mentally disabled aka quintons in their fight to disney in their fight disney
propaganda he has been corrupted by goliath perhaps for the better the fact that quinton
can see right through riser skywalker means he's you know he's developing he's evolving as a critic
me and my friends watched judge dread 1995 after watching tros to get that awful movie out of our
heads now that's how tismy this movie is i thought that's a goofy movie you guys seen judge
dread 95 movie no i am just alone no i am the law i am the law interesting one
people in chat are talking about uh fucking code leoko you guys ever heard of that one
yeah i remember code leoko it was so weird because they all had like they all had like skyscrapers for
foreheads yeah and it was like a french like anime so like the lip flap the lip flap was so abysmal
i really liked that show back in the day yeah i remember i remember it i mean i'd
wonder if it was good or if i was just a kid and i thought everything was good
yeah it's a french cartoon um i'd love to like revisit that show honestly
um hi rags you sexy beast hello um
okay i'm gonna i'm gonna read this out and post it to you guys because i know you won't believe
me if i was just to read this out in a stink mina rant stop fj yo themes jl he has j long bones
um i remember one of the coley ocho guys turned into like a furry cat and he would
i don't know it's just what i remember so i'd pick up one of them had a sword one of them had a fan
guy right yeah sounds french yeah checks out uh for refab 69 you should review the captain marvel
uh for refab 69 you should review the captain marvel triple x parody or x x x parody uh also
have you guys seen uncut gems or do you plan on seeing it looks good no when you say people have
often asked me if i like my gems cut or uncut however i don't know exactly what you mean
is that a movie uncut gems and i have heard good things it's adam sandler what apparently it's good
wow i don't want to say which is where we're at first time i'm speechless
um and then uh as for the captain marvel triple x parody it's gonna be better written than the
captain marvel for sure but as for efap 69 i don't know i don't know what me and rag's plans are
gonna be do something could that be the one where we have all women i don't know the whole fap
it's terrifying to do something like that but you know bigger things have been risked
um chasing a dream
prequels gave us a lot of great expanded universe materials sequels have done nothing but destroy
the mechanics of the universe yes yes they have that is correct george Lucas so um here's the
thing i fucking hate war according to quinton yes don't the rebels go to war with the empire
to defend themselves from imperial aggression i guess rebelling against an empire is imperialism
yep so yeah that was the obvious thing it's just like war bad tool of imperialism like tool of
also people who want to be free from okay whatever uh j long bones say fuck your themes like stink
meaner oh that's what that's what that was supposed to be okay
um i will save that for the next time she happens to be here
have you seen nostalgia critics sibling rivalry review of the riser skywalker might be some good
efap material um that was gonna be in the selection i'll have to vet it to see if it could work
but uh possibility you know me and rags would actually have to stream for like
every single day for a full two weeks to get to all of the like initial tism takes we're gonna
have to get you know a couple i think quinton's one was a pretty good uh example of where people
who like tlj's mindsets are at but um you know who knows what else we can um er in a room with
a black woman wildly unexpected i know oh why would that be you even subscribe to her don't you
yes oh my god oh my god keep tabs on her presumably it would be a pretty brief
time spent collectively in that room why what are you what are you saying
you're saying chase i mean you know because he's saying black woman you know yeah it's you forgot
the pickles you zoomers i mean is is spongebob a boomer property or a zoomer property
definitely a boomer property oh no it's obviously a zoomer property boomers in the fucking 50s
not these days that's not what i mean if you're gonna go that far boobies anything like
further than one year ago then you're a boomer basic yeah pretty much it's used pretty loosely
to change the subject briefly the worst thing about mundane matt for me is that he convinced my
friend that youtube isn't a job where am i monday oh most people it's not matt is it because
he makes it seem so like pathetic or i don't know or is it that he actually argues that it's not i
don't know because it's monday matt i i have no idea what his position is yeah i don't know
it could be the stupid dumb one i mean okay if we're talking about like a reliable job that can
like pay the bills for most people no it's not a job it's just like a means of passive income
i mean like i have like 84 000 subscribers or something like that and whenever like my
youtube check comes in it's like 30 because i don't upload like all the time if you upload
regularly and get a lot of like views like if you upload like daily videos or something yeah it
could totally be a viable job but for people that have like different editing styles and upload
schedules not necessarily yeah just uh would be about figuring out exactly what things you think
need to be ticked in order for it to be constituting a job like if someone said
reliable's uh strict contracted income uh yeah youtube isn't exactly it doesn't really work like
that and you could lose your whole channel overnight yeah hooray um somebody just sent
me uh this let me host it
that is not bad yeah i love anime i like it
like if we were in cuphead sort of sonic oh yeah shit that's sonic obviously
yeah i would make you tails wolf sonic and who would i be at that point
tails no wait gas man his name knuckles
oh yeah that's right yeah yeah i don't know my sonic very well yeah i like it a lot though
i think that's very good i think it's very good uh is this mongoloid making sense
i mostly understood quinton's video it was just that it was just poorly structured i guess
um sorry long man i'm at work and i can't listen oh save it for later um
um oh this gooney man again gooney man gooney man you have a known refer to quinton as the gooney man
the gooney man i don't remember referring to him as that but he gooney is a word that i would
yeah i would associate gooney with him um i'm glad that the shot for sorry was gooney a slur for
um child adventurer probably oh my yeah i know um i'm glad that the charred skeletons of owen and
buru went still there when ray got to the farm it's like bleached bones next to the building oh my god
what happened oh dear
um
um
she could be ray solo because she's alone oh god remember that remember that when he got named solo
because he was alone yeah he thought they were so fucking clever
sorry i'm just thinking about that again it's just such a crazy realization that's like yeah they
they put that in there they felt like we needed that we needed to know how he got the surname
solo they must have thought like yeah how much does that make sense that he's on his own you know
he's solo oh so good couldn't just be called so on is just a massive cuck compared to ray
pretty much yeah she chose her own he was just like family name he was named by the empire
damn looks to be you buddy
um hour one all right i think he mispronounced chads i've definitely heard chuds before
that's why when he said it i was like oh i i think i know what that is i don't think i've ever heard it
when are you glorious massives going to play smash bros the cosmic chicken demands it
uh efap gaming tough to tough to get that in in position as well as specific games uh
definitely on the cards not exactly sure when don't want to promise anything
uh i'm still on board with the idea would like to do it yeah absolutely definitely do one too
uh also high rags you magnificent hello dog gone you oh that's nice of you to say
hey you see quinton my son he who controls the sugar controls the arteries of men page three
panel three of the width of diabeto issue four of the width of diabeta chud is from a movie called
chud you fools fair enough uh watch the newest star wars bad lip reading tlj i actually did
watch that i thought it was funny i just don't think it's as funny as the one they made about empire
um with the uh the yoda singing things good shit stream started an hour ago awesome it just
started hello all my j long bone words glad er is here and have a happy new year also high wags
hello happy new year oh and quinton your gore field design for libra blows also
oh for libra blows also do you need a doctor because you're talking about points that don't
exist quit quit talking to number one oh i think that might be referencing the whole like
uh sort of crazy like meta narratives he was generating about what the trilogy
means to the ot or whatever that's probably what it was um wait a minute er on efap with a black
and a black woman at that yeah not buying it clearly it's not possible fess up mauler which
one's the fake um well they never spoke at exactly the same time did they so just saying
um
did quinton just assume ray and luke's gender whoa whoa
they've got to be stopped two things have you guys seen the kylo peshy videos
no i haven't nope no i haven't have you seen the wakali woods new movie and if not will you
watch any fap movies i've not heard of it no um let's see is it gonna be um
uh well i'm a kylo would i'm of the best of the best movie
loading the website it just says oh my goodness their official website is crazy in a good way
okay yeah wow
here i'll post it right there just take a look
oh nice wow get ebola this is like some super fanny this is like some throwback
e-bombs world shit yeah wow
well yeah we haven't uh i don't know about any of them specifically but you know
no reason why we couldn't eventually check that on efap movies at some point maybe
yeah it's stupid when i saw rise of skywalker last night and hans ghost showed up a man in
my row stood up and said star wars is over and left oh um yeah maybe i um little lame but yeah
i don't even know what they're gonna do next i shudder to think what it will be
i guess tlj didn't ruin it for him it was uh why is this guy okay
uh quinton got hot takes and hot cakes confused
oh and we have my theory about palpatine serving the death star chunk be fap canon
i i mean i don't do i think we should all treat it as though that was
what happened the whole time the dark side can make anyone tubular
of course vader's redemption feels like bs when the left won't accept someone going back on
mistakes they made in the past also hi ea hello um i mean that's the thing though i wouldn't
actually be against vader facing some kind of repercussion for his war crimes it's not like i
would be like oh it's forgiven because you threw the emperor down a hole i'd be like uh
oh man you did a lot of things he died yeah that's why it kind of just works out that way
and there's no awkward questions to ask he's just he's burned on a pyre it's fine unless he
was cloned in which case uh-oh am i the only one who thinks it's obnoxious that he compares
the imperials as nazis please stop doing that it uh this isn't will war two movie just stop
um i mean it's pretty easy to compare them though right especially with the costumes
of the uh the generals and all the the lock stepping and the black and white aesthetics and stuff
yeah they're not really they're not doing it very so
oi molly nazis is the big thing now what are you doing objectively ranking iron man 3 above
infinity war and civil war on twitter i mean you do you but also but why i i assume you've got it
backwards because that doesn't sound like me uh also hello wanks hello it's all riser skywalker
yesterday with someone who has not seen the other sequels when luke appeared she said isn't that obi
one that was the most enjoyment i had from the movie oh yes that is obi one yes he's back he's
alive i want to show quinton all the text between me and my college hookups and then tell him about
all the ways i was abusive misogynistic and shitty to them so i can watch him disintegrate the way
palpatine did okay whatever floats your boat uh why attack the ot why attack vader why does
this have to do with riser skywalker i don't know quinton was bored he used to know what to talk
about for 30 minutes i can't just talk about the movie i have to set up some thing about something
else and talk about other stuff before i just talk about the movie uh this is pardon my previous
chat this mongoloid makes no sense and the previous one was asking if he makes sense
that's continuity for you funny how you mentioned vader in a white suit um i believe that someone
made a meme about that actually we can eventually show if i get uh toward the end of this
they're only children if you interpret them as such correct er's muted avatar is single-handedly
canceling out the pain of seeing quinton's face right now quinton welcome oh extra star wars
media did not exist to mirror and revolve around the ot plenty of eu media did its own thing in
both the future and the past yeah and there's loads that came around the prequels as well
prequels were uh pretty respected in terms of the stuff that came around them a lot of the games
and uh books etc uh what the fuck did i tune into why is he back oh or quinton apparently
quinton's not like popular around the efap sort of community did you know about this
i didn't know no idea yeah that's crazy leave it to a godless atheist degenerate to not know how
to redemption works quinton you're gonna burn in hell and your infinite blubber is gonna power
satan's furnace for all eternity oh satan's furnace runs on blubber i think so yeah i mean i
guess it makes sense i don't know i don't want to say that that's you know yeah all right whatever
works uh quinton's virginity and sadness is making my cock rock hard i'm going to fuck the cock boy
oh my god that was from mr dimento somehow that makes sense i think uh yeah i'll say it quinton is
a starlinist one death is a tragedy a million is a statistic hi rags hey i'm so glad they hate star
wars rise of skywalker broken clocks of course they do it shout on right uh tlj
clock and blocks i guess it's inevitable can we now say the star wars franchise is the cinematic
equivalent of a delicious meat patty ot between two excrement buns prequels and sequels but that
implies i prefer to have good buns we can we can we just take not have the buns you guys can keep
the buns we will have the um i'll just have a delicious steak it's not that your blood is better
jackass that would be subjective to you if you have midichlorians or not it makes your blood better
what the fuck i guess it yeah if it directly meant that you're better with the force
and you decided that people were better than other people if they had better force
then that's on you i guess uh quinton had over 700 midichlor i mean chromosomes also hi rags
hello wait quinton has over seven billion chromosomes oh my god i guess the force works
in mysterious ways uh ray should have gone back to alderaan which it turns out survived episode six
oh wait episode four sorry yeah i mean they could have cloned alderaan you don't know
clone planets clone planets uh don't you know that if literally everybody can't do literally
everything it's fascism any recognition of even the slightest genetic differences is evil don't
you know that evil those jedi nazis i found i am all the sith versus i am all the jedi stupid
because weren't we led to think that there'd been hundreds of thousands possibly millions of jedi
with not nearly as many sith i guess that's why they beat the jedi the sith because there's more
of them i guess that makes sense then right like billions of jedi versus a couple hundred sith
yeah you know palps wasn't gonna win balance you know it's a balance we need a chart
uh the force can be random like being a wizard in harry potter it helps to be a part of a family
but it's not a guarantee scientists are still working on a space elevator allowing amazing
travel to beyond our planet ra is this high enough roof for quinton maybe darth vaidya
darth er the wise emperor
i like it yeah
he's a little overtly spazzy
r2 sees leah's birth and death yeah kind of weird
oh well yeah r2 is there for all the big events i guess
i still don't get why he didn't go with them on the mission he just stayed at home
like why uh so can you go and you bang force ghosts now pregnancy too
well i mean theoretically yes if they can interact with physical objects then you could just
the weird part is that you'd probably still be able to see your cock while i was up there
so yeah because they're trans they are translucent so you would watch yourself coming inside of them
and you you could see where the cum goes and oh my it's all very complicated now
i would enjoy that i mean we didn't invent the rules guys okay we did not invent they're
probably like cold though i don't know they just look like they would be
uh being bitter at something because of inherent physical traits is fascist just look at usain
bolt oh being better at something sorry i mean yeah uh that's this that would be
racism and fascism yeah they just wanted his really good genes uh thank you jay longbode
fought negroid oh my goodness oh my goodness now there's a clip of you saying negroid well
you know i was tricked uh put it on the soundboard i was tricked not as bad as me saying that all
black people are ewoks you know i think that that trumps me then again i just said it now
we're gonna be saying i have a glimpse as well it's all over everything falls apart um in return
of the jedi only luke could see the force ghosts at the ewok village not sure what that means for
force ghost mythos um the less we know the better when it comes to force ghosts honestly
but unfortunately the newer films kind of fucked with that a lot i feel efap needs a star wars
fanatic in order to answer questions and counter this guy's bs yeah we don't have like a super lore
expert unfortunately um i think we get by mostly okay because we know the film's pretty well
uh midichlorians are the powerhouse of the cell
oni efap crossover with chase when
the oni and g coming on efap that could happen right chase make it happen i'm sure you'd be
interested the only thing is that um i'm acquainted with chris i guess you i guess we're friends i
don't know um he he seems to always have a very um a bit of a short attention span when it comes
to some long-form things not necessarily all the time but i feel like he would get really bored
really quickly unless the conversation was engaging i would fucking love to see him talk
with you guys because he's a very funny boy oh he'd have he's extremely busy like making the
new game that he's working on and stuff what a nerd yeah fucking asshole um someone there's
like post of like chinese letters far she and it's too vow to pledge to swear okay
ah she cool kwon iton's stupidity hurts my brain
long bone you seem watchman according to the show you can smell racetisms off the people
like bleach so you must be able to tell if er is one well it's a pity we can't get a definitive
answer on that but now you'll never know i'll have to ask her what she smelt when she was here
before uh i think it's important to remember the jedi are a religion what they believe isn't
necessarily fact same with the sith except force ghostiness stuff that's just straight up someone
you can learn how to do right like i said yoda's like yeah you just have to sort of know how to do
it not like a religion related thing i guess why we wear is that doesn't happen as a result of
someone judging you good from what i understand anyway oh god i'm getting flashbacks of chance
jack jann jack saint's moronic video of how the disney movie sky high is an absolute
fascist eugenics it's about fascist eugenics um can you prove it's not
have you guys seen sky high no i know of it like i've i've heard of it but i've never seen it
yeah and rewatch it because it was just such incredible eugenics propaganda
i'd missed out apparently
are like are so are all um like professional teams sports teams are they fascists because
they just want the most like physically competent players they can get or like how how far does this
thing go well um i don't think you want to go down that rabbit hole their rules are very
simple rags and if you can't understand them you're probably racist
do you see that silence that's the guilty are often silent yeah the gears are turning but i
got nothing isn't isn't eugenics like fucking phasing out like black people or something from
like selective breeding that's about as much as i understand about it i could be entirely wrong
there's selective breeding in sky high uh i thought i heard someone say something about eugenics
well isn't eugenics when you just like you're picking specific traits that you want to
develop and getting rid of the ones you don't i think so but i think people have kind of
forced upon it like thrusted upon it like a permanent racial spin i'm i'm no fucking i'm
no biologist i know nothing about any of it if i could give my kids superpowers i probably would
yeah oh me too wow you racist yeah um let's save random kid instead of luke empire wins
there are two forces living and cosmic 50 short
um what am i supposed to make of that
that's what it says
we're two forces living in a cosmic 50 short feels like a riddle
yeah i know uh i don't like quinton but if you apply the bite model to the jedi they
do count as a cult telltale is a youtube channel that covered this subject
if you apply the what the bite model i don't know what that is
it's the bite oh i said dog i can tell you all about the bite model
but i can't but i won't it's just not it's a it's an industry secret it's you gotta
you know there is a thing i promise you there's a thing there's a bite model
it's not the actual bite model i don't know i guess to deterred cults i don't know uh
quinton's jealous of how it should have ended probably they're super successful and enjoy
what they do uh quinton is kind of special needs you don't uh you don't want to help
oh he's the kind of special needs you don't want to help damn spoiler he dresses the sex
dollar's jab it claps wouldn't he clap for jab at that point
four claps for jab
er has been hacked by russian downvoting russian's downvoting riser skywalker
apparently it doesn't matter all the russian bots are there's even more russian bots by
disney to keep it right where it needs to be yeah evidently did snoke somehow not know that
the girl who beat up kylo ben was pulpersu or did he just give him shit because evil people
think girls suck oh right snoke then like haha you were beaten by a girl it's like that girl is
the other half of the forced dyads granddaughter of palpatine do you not know this
it's obvious this is the story that was began in 1977 yeah everyone knew that that was the case
uh holy grandpalp where did you hide all the imperial gold also high rags hello or not holy
hay grandpalp oh yeah you can probably ask him about the imperial gold you could be like you
must have had a store somewhere in fact just sell one of those star destroyers you probably get a
shit ton of money go sell them to the huts set it to the huts if you can't ship it out
screw you have to find your way past the space cancer there's a lot of room around the planet
i think you'll be right and see how despite her powers and abilities it's hard to put the finger
on why people are interested in her either way uh yeah there's the constant confusion as to why
everybody in the plot is like hey ray's cool ray's awesome i like ray it's like why why
i was the only person who shows her any kind of like disdain in the new movie and that's
dropped by the end remember how that was a thing and they just didn't do anything with it
i was like annoyed at her and then nothing happens with it
weird uh hour two oh we made it to hour two there you go
don't forget to cover roberto movies take of it's fine much love jay longbone is top waifu
kick jay for obvious reasons execute rags for uwu's
no the uwu's will keep me strong for all time i cannot die
um and yeah we did cover cinema rivertos
subjectively speaking even if it doesn't make sense in story what is something that never
fails to affect you emotionally for everyone personally i can already suggest one of those
and loads of movies do it it's when they kill a dog everyone gets very upset whenever you kill a
dog how dare you so people usually get more upset at that killing a random person like if you kill
a dog it's just like hmm would you ask go on um i was just saying for me personally i feel like
a lot of it is um if there's like uh like a family not a family sorry so there's some noise
in the background distracting me uh if there's like a character that's going through hell and
back and it's just like a really genuinely sad situation and then the character just like is
struggling to stay strong and eventually just like breaks down crying and you can really empathize
for that character that's something that always gets to me i mean mauler you know more than anyone
my clanoa video is like kind of a good example of that or just like if you see someone in a really
really raw relatable emotional state that's something that never ceases to um not get an
emotional reaction out of me and like you said yeah killing animals that's like something really
sad taking away something really precious to someone usually does it um i mean the the spirit
of the question was sort of like would that still work if it didn't make sense what are like emotional
things that still get to you even when a lot of the things around it are just nonsense that's why
i was referencing like if a if a pet dies in a movie when it doesn't make any sense people usually get
pretty moved by it regardless because like oh man automatically yeah i would i would say my
answer still is still the same i'm not really uh too like i you know i can suspend disbelief
sometimes and just uh ignore things that don't make sense if like the final product is a satisfying
neat little package i'm a little different in that case uh to you guys
not as nerdy in that regard i mean your words not mine hey you masses i just had a debate with
a fan of the sequel trilogy and really held my own i got him to admit that he primarily
liked it because it felt like star wars it's all thanks to you guys oh how about that
changing i'm glad to have that incredible impact on you
student god's work dating ray who's that girl oh she's my resu i get it i
doth vader luke i am your father quinton who cares it's not important luke doesn't
even know vader luke's just a farmer we probably should have brought that up yeah it's like
when they revealed that vader was luke's dad it's like oh don't you matter
molar rags do your best impression of each other
molar rags do your best impression of each other
molar molar molar rags do your best impression of each other
all right now say that but in your normal voice and then i will have several attempts at making
your voice molar rags do your best impression of each other molar rags do your best impression of
each other that's pretty good american accent yeah we did it we are we are the the dark side
it is a pathway to victory i was telling i was telling molar i figured if you were there or not
but uh after we got done doing the many many uh dnd sessions rags i started to kind of get a little
bit of a feel for you know some of your mannerisms and the way that you talk and just sort of very
smoothly transition from word to word and it's just very like well probably a little bit higher
pitched than that but you you definitely carry yourself with like just a lot of grace a lot of
uh just very sort of tempered responses to things and uh and you just take like very thoughtful
pauses it comes across very elegantly i know no one asked me well you know it's always good to
get your opinion either way i'm glad we were around before it yeah we don't despise you
there's no need to imply that you're fine yeah every once in a while you'll remind us why we
keep you around yay he's like oh okay people like me uh i think this is the most hack take
from the tlj as if other jedi like qui-gon was special because of their lineages
yeah i think that's a fair point too did every single fucking kid in the prequels at every jedi
come from a log fably lie that all went back to like one dude called john skywalker
i don't think so john well i mean all humans here so yeah there was there was the original apex jedi
right yes the original apex jedi and he split in two and became a jedi and a sith and they fought
each other and then had babies yeah new law and then it was just jedi incest god you know what
they might do that disney is stupid enough to be like in the beginning there was one mad
john skywalk and be like no you're ruining everything again like it's like literally
a bunch of idiots in a room like what do they want it can't it can't be the things that they're saying
uh best thing about kylo ben he was great as scott pilgrim
who oh michael sera i get it michael sera yeah he was scott pilgrim i don't know
like are we talking about like the the comics or the movie because scott pilgrim was originally
like the comic series he had quite a lot of personality even if it was pretty uh milk toast
and overdone oh you know what imagine all jedi did get a meet-up like in some kind of post jedi-ish
place force coast wise and like the little kid the anakin killed first out of all the young
wings was just like there and then anakin's like hey and he's like you fucking killed me he's like
well i mean i saved the universe eventually he's like what you could have done that in the face
he's like yeah what you go like he tries to avoid him at this party like force ghost party
where everyone's just chilling out having drinks kid keeps trying to walk up he's like go away
master skywalker he's like shut the fuck up
uh did you know dog food lid backwards is dildo of god
is oh yeah dog food lit yeah it is dildo of god
i like that it just ends with seah like that's the end of that super chat thank you for your
amazing super chat driver's face reveal was more jarring than helmet oh the dark helmet i'm assuming
um thoughts on british tv series red dwarf i only ever watched a couple of episodes of it
it's the one that i really missed out of all the british tv shows but uh uh good from what i know
i'm gonna assume yeah i'm gonna assume these three haven't actually heard of it
i'm with yeah there you go i think that's yeah all right uh disney max disney after dark disney
hub give it time we'll get all of them disney ho y'all need to watch the latest flash gets video
it proves disney has no clue and can't legally capture americans what disney can't legally
capture americans the mouse one i don't know maybe yeah but george lucas and mickey mouse
i haven't seen it um but maybe you haven't who did i see that with oh i saw it with fun fact
yeah um what's the new and what's the new flash kids animation uh why didn't they just go to the
batman beyond route and have it be the palpatine had put a chip in his mind and dna in someone
before he died a chip in his a chip with his mind and dna in someone else that sounds uh
uh i don't know man like i don't know i just i i just stay dead palpatine okay stay dead
uh thanks stay dead please thanks for the best how how could we be sure he's dead now exactly that's
like we have no idea he could still be alive on xicle mark two on some moon outside of some
more strings in a cave like yes next generation kylo red is walking into this dark place you see a
a bunch of tubes it is a bunch of emperor faces in there he's like you see
i created several puppets of puppets of puppets like are you the real one he's like no
infinite movies endless trash as mike would say
thanks for the birthday efab but i'll watch it later because i'm not caught up yet also high regs
hey winton cinema roberto and hitler what do these guys have in common an obsession with bloodlines
um oh my god deniable
um i wrote that as a joke do you get the reference
i have not seen batman beyond so uh i possibly won't we need to watch batman and robin again
oh yeah i don't even know that we deserve to see such incredible content you know after all the
horrible days so refreshing after the rise of skywalker to see some get some good fucking food
oh quinton i'm afraid your vibrating vader love doll will be fully operational when your girl arrives
no fully operational ray is the voice of every skywalker ever all three
yeah well there was four you go to count shmi skywalker as well she's in there
killing ooh has anyone seen upgrade i have not but i i want to i almost went and saw it but
something popped up i have is it good it's pretty good yeah that's what i heard hi rags
hey why are we here just to suffer
yeah i didn't do the meme version i just read it out casually that's that's that's me right there
i'm just i i wanted to honestly present the question and get some answers why are we here
is it just to suffer it is there you go that's the answer to bring joy to others
halpertine in his voice hear me people of the galaxy eppstein did kill himself and i told him
to do it oh imagine that's the message they spread throughout fortnite fortnite i could
be something that fortnite could legit do yeah uh also hi er hi hello rags also co-star mauler
will you massives review the mandalorian uh we are interested yeah so the plan will probably be to
uh give an old re-watch to the eight episodes in prep for nefap where we'll have i think shad
said he was interested in fringy so we'll try and make it an australian friendly one
as in time zone wise and uh we will break down our thoughts on episodes one through eight
get a sort of conclusion i suppose but yeah we do plan to have an efap dedicated to it
at some point um also mauler will you ever review the prequels i do intend to uh i just need some
time dealing with other other things though clearly if i kept up to date with star wars i
don't think i'll ever be able to get to the prequels because disney are probably gonna
start plugging out more and more things have they announced any plans for movies yet it's
just the obi-wan tv show right that's all we know i think yeah they don't they're not gonna do
something about the movie sorry wasn't there something about a mandalorian movie was there
oh i think from the guy who made the logan movie right that was a thing at one point
it was i can't remember his name but i don't know if that got cancelled or not because of
all the stuff that happened with solo um i guess we'll find out uh the falcon's porg
porg echelorian count has dropped i like they actually had an issue with that the fact that
the porgs went on the falcon fucking coming at me for nitpicking and like arguing that it
makes them spineless all right uh now i want pie fair enough the ot totally never implied the force
had to do with bloodlines obi-wan luke is our only hope yoda no there is another his sister luke the
force is strong in my family nope blame the other the pt yeah i think that's fair the ot is
definitely implying bloodlines are important for a force potency i suppose at least or maybe ease of
access in some way there's definitely a conversation to be had there uh chirrut in way am i a joke to
you oh yeah so i don't know if you guys are very serious remember but chirrut in way was not a
character everyone hated and yet he was asian what do we do we just carry on hate nation okay
um tug just reported star wars calendar retcon comments star wars calendar retcon
i don't know of this
um uh why does he try to talk like a valley girl reminds me of a great video sof did about
how these soy boys try to laugh as the stacie's they shat on them that shat on them in high school
as a coping mechanism for the trauma i mean i i hate to be an armchair psychologist but you
just might be onto something there sherlock you know who's underrepresented in hollywood good
writers oh oh shit you don't see many of them on the big screen these days it's all a bunch of
fucking hoes good night all and good morning me when i hear this get read out also high wags hello
long man isn't a race it's a creed um it's a stretch hey that's that's a good one right
it's a hey hey neon nub was asian oh you remember neon nub he was a tfa by the way he did tid back
up in tlj or t t t r o s neon nub yeah the weird creature that helped neon nando destroy the the
death star he is a it's okay the wikipedia page says that he's a fictional character in the star
wars franchise oh a fictional one yeah it's it starts off neon nub is a fictional character
in the star wars franchise phew man thank god um i just got here now and i want to leave because
you made me look at quinton also hi rags hey actor rahool coley is mad on twitter because of rose
yeah like i said a lot of people are very pissed off and they did that whole like rose deserved
better thing and i like it's it's laughing fuel complete laughing fuel she's such an iconic
character who the great rose taiko so important um fuck representation quinton you lard ass this
year's award season is based precisely because there's no representation crap plaguing it
uh tea and arab
um this year's award season we're talking about oscars i still need to see the oscar nominations
i haven't seen all of them yet just so i'm in the know you know i'm a i'm a film honest war
i kind of sway so i gotta make sure i do you know eventually um should have focused on rose's sister
and not killed her off so so early uh yeah a lot of people seem to be much more on board with that
character even though she had like no lines really i think it's just because of how annoying everyone
found rose taiko so yeah weird that that's how that worked out um i needed rose and riser skywalker
because then i get to look at women oh yeah you can't look at her honest
there is not enough white representation in bollywood ree
belobigus bungus was there that was a quote from belobigus bungus
oh belaga belobigus bungus with the wisdom thank you belobigus i'm sorry mr bungus i thoroughly
enjoyed the rise of skywalker after seven and eight i had no more hope or rage left in me
nine was essentially a hilarious parody i laughed my fucking ass off good glad you had fun with it
because like i said i i was smirking at several points in that film and if it was the right crowd
i would have happily laughed um if you had to choose one would you be jenny's porg or quinton's
doll jenny's porg yeah if you're jenny's porg you get to hang out with jeb so he's in there that's
true oh yeah that that's the reason and clap for him would be great yeah video game donkey
recently i don't want to i don't want to see quinton naked quite frankly
yeah uh video game donkey recently shat on mark after dark who criticized dunk's death stranding
review dunk barely addressed most of mark's points cherry picking some of mark's quotes to make him
look bad yes all that really i don't know anything about good luck in fairness so basically uh mark
who's like a really good friend of mine he just made like a long like 50 minute rant uh watching
donkey's video and kind of critiquing it and uh donkey in his donkey fashion just kind of
took a few little snippets out of context uh for like a quick easy gag i don't really think it was
warranted i'm kind of torn because like i like donkey and i like mark and i think mark's are
donkey's original video was the correct even though he didn't like it wasn't a super robust
explanation but i do think it's a little bit dumb of him to send his his league of like his
legion of five million fucking youtube stands to go like knowing that they would go attack mark
he sent people to go to someone and attack them i think you just covered him right obviously
so so yeah covered him knowing that his his uh but oh that's not against him at all no but not
so this has happened before when donkey did his review of uh the other game i feel like
you probably know this better than me chase but he did a review of awkward fact right
that's it yeah yeah and he got criticized for like um he got a couple things wrong and it was evident
he'd only played x amount of the game when he needed to play a lot more to give the points he
was giving and he like the one other one thing i remember finding out was the then this is this is
me for lack of a better word paraphrasing the events this is how i remember but it's the same
sort of situation as me basically being like look how shit pokemon is and i'm like i have a pokemon
that has no pp in any fucking move i'm just using donkey has no pp plants octobert traveler was
well his video wasn't very good though uh no it wasn't but and he got criticized and then his
response like left out so much of the significant criticism about his video and just went for like
the fact that the guy the guy said like i haven't played the game and donkey was like wow you're
like responding to me and you haven't played the game which by the way rags that would be the
equivalent of me being like this movie called you know let's just say it's the stalls episode 10
it's so bad because there are fucking asian people in it and then you go whoa that's not a
reason for a film to be bad then i go have you even seen it no or like you you have no fucking
position to argue it's like well hang on his arguments didn't require that he had actually
played the game in full a lot of the counters and i remember being annoyed looking into it
um that donkey didn't sort of put more effort into it and so i want to clarify as well yeah
how we cover somebody and if someone said you send hordes to people or something i'd be like
number one uh we discourage any kind of like uh brigading or negative comments even and we
we will often try and make a pragmatic argument for it you're just gonna not only gonna upset the
person but you just make you everyone look worse in doing so if you're just like you piece of shit
i hate you because your opinion's stupid um i wasn't trying to say no no no no i'm getting
that just that's always gonna happen um and secondly we usually play the person's full video
while donkey will play like very specific clips to make them look stupid and then just leave it
there it's like okay yeah don't donkey's entire format is just you can't ever get too serious
or like commit to like uh you know like a sincere argument he just kind of goes in for like the quick
laugh yeah which which can be harmless i just don't know that i don't i don't know all the
specifics i'd have to watch all of the videos but how's how's mark feel about it uh mark got pretty
stressed out by it understandably but i think i saw he made a tweet today saying like oh thanks
for everyone like there was there was some good criticism in there even the people who yelled at
me and i mean i love mark but he and i we we are like polar fucking opposites on how we feel about
death stranding i think it is the most pretentious pile of of schlock i mean you guys know i've
fucking ranted about it not that one looks like yeah there's actually like shit that you can get
like key items and things that you can unlock and they cover like a little bit of backstory about
like the development and one of them is just like you can tell kajima wrote it in the third person
it's like kajima first found out about low roar the band used for the main theme song or like for
the music in the game in an islandic record store and it's just like oh he has to let everyone know
just how fucking quirky and indie and eccentric is his means of discovering new music is and
the whole thing just all the acting was so overdone and there's not enough gameplay like
it distracts you by giving you upgrades and shit but then the core gameplay loop under that is just
fetch quests and sure it's it's a little more than that but it's mostly just that and uh marks a lot
of mark's argument was kind of like well i enjoyed it and it was yeah well if the game has you doing
things you're going to feel like oh i'm doing like it's fun i'm accomplishing things but it's
like there needs to be more than that in my opinion so it's it's a whole it's a whole thing
but yeah i think mark smark's it was just like a clip from stream it wasn't like a dedicated
like takedown video or like really serious opinion piece it was just him kind of talking off the cuff
and i feel like that's what uh donkey sort of exploited was just some some mild contradictions
um well yeah i hope that it didn't end up too badly uh the mark and yeah hopefully the
there's some discourse to be had about death stranding because i don't care to get involved
in any of it because that game looks too boring um but maybe that's my bigotry talking and that
it is actually very good because i know that you got people on both sides of that argument
i have uh yeah like there's people who like it's great but there's also people who like it's
terrible um see it's like as a huge metal gear fan i for the longest time was just the biggest
kajima apologize because he does make really good shit but like death stranding is what happens
when you tell hideo kajima who has never been met with failure that he can do anything he wants and
he just makes the most fucking just like artsy fartsy film game and there's no one to tell him
like yeah might be a bad idea because before the developers at konami presumably were like okay but
is this going to be fun and this time around everyone's just like kajima do whatever you
want and he's like okay i would make this a metaphor about the trump racist you used an
accent stereotypical accent that means you're racist now i love imitating japanese men i've
fucking bought and supported all their games my entire life i feel like i can give them a little
wow you feel like you've bought them like they're slaves the fuck japanese george lucas not wrong
anyway yeah um i you know i maybe i'll look into some of that like
dunkey just um he just seems to like want to just chill out have a fun time or whatever but you know
yeah um i just i've never found him i've said this before i don't find him particularly
informative i find him funny yeah no he's he's good but if you said he's anything beyond like
surface level uh you'd be lying like in some of his dunk views he can delve a bit deeper
but he definitely has a hard time breaking away from being uh entertaining and goofy to actually
be more sincere about things like if dunkey ever actually did like a long-form response to
criticism against him i feel like it would be extremely jarring yeah because it's like whoa
i remember when he did legal legend stuff only
wait really quickly someone in chat said death stranding is definitely not for everyone
the amount of fucking times i have heard that sentence regurgitated
no it is not for everyone it's not even for most people it is a game where you deliver packages
watch cutscenes about characters that you just fucking met have it thrust upon you that they
are these super deep enigmatic interesting intimate characters metal gear was great because
you got to know all of these characters and there was like a lot of backstory to it that
you could really chew on and characters that you could really be like i don't like this character
but i like this character and then death stranding is just like it's just kajima being a socialite
he's just like i've been to all these parties have met all these famous actors i really like
this character in this movie so i'm fucking gonna ask them if they want to be in my game and of
course he's literally a celebrity in japan so of course they're gonna say yes and so it's literally
just him hanging out the big fucking cool kids table being like do you want to make a game together
and they're like fucking yeah you're paying like three million dollars it's just but everything
reeks of just god-awful bullshit and i'm a huge kajima fan so it like hurts to say that but death
stranding is fucking bad anyway let's get off the subject let me have a bad mike tessa said hey
will remembers yuka review it's like yeah i saw the so one of the complaints people had about his
death stranding video is that he's showing like look the fucking motorcycle doesn't work properly
when he's like going uphill into a mountain and stuff and so it's like why would you expect it to
work in that scenario and i'm not saying that i know that for sure that was the impression i got
but then interestingly like with his ukulele review he would talk about like how bad the controls are
and one of his like fucking two examples would be on one of the most difficult uh
platforming courses with slippery ground when you're trying to grab things in a time limit
and he's exciting that as an example of bad controls and it's like that's not even remotely
fucking fair the whole idea is slippery like i can kind of understand because like with
dunkey's videos he definitely takes the bits that support his arguments and show them even if they're
not 100 consistently true but like in death stranding you get a bike and then you're thinking
oh yeah i'd love to you know ride around this bike and it makes traveling so much easier
but then everywhere on like if a little rock on the ground is greater than like you know
two inches tall it'll cause your character to like fucking noticeably stop in his tracks so
it's like he may not have showed a super pertinent clip but he's absolutely uh he's absolutely right
like the terrain in that game is just an absolute nightmare like there's no real clear indication
of what will and will not be climbable sometimes it's it's seriously i think he said in the video
it's like the in oblivion when you're trying to climb your horse up the side of a mountain and
just glitch up as fast as you can that's honestly what death stranding's uh terrain boils down to at
times but he makes some good points mark makes some good points it's all you don't want to just
came in i muted you on twitter chase but fear takes okay you said that all right sideburn said
that oh let me use the lid i'll be right back okay um just got here and the very first thing i see
is quinton's construction site porta party face here's some money i guess oh i thank you love the
deep analysis you guys do so hard to find in media keep up the yeoman's work i mean yeah we
do we you could say these podcasts are pretty long couldn't you would you guys reckon do you
think yeah sort of yeah yeah okay i voiced the wrong here um but uh say it again i i said what
do you guys reckon these podcasts are pretty long right what do you think yeah i like it that way
though um why didn't waynton buy an asian doll pot kettle that's true he could have and he didn't
why do you stick to the way he why didn't he buy an ewok doll hmm
we know the truth i think support white dominance kind of fucked up dude yeah nazis hate everyone
who aren't german is that so on centrist glass cannon said the game literally has a terrain
rating scanner yes and you can't use it every fucking second to dictate when the terrain you're
flying at at like 60 miles per hour is going to be something you can ride over that's not a perfect
solution is not like that's the weirdest thing about death stranding i hate to get back on this
topic but i'm seeing all sorts of dog shit in the chat death stranding has flaws it's okay to
acknowledge that it's not a perfect game it's not an objectively terrible game it's just not a great
game is that so contentious to say like there's so many like kajima's fans are some of the worst
because you can't even point out an objectively like questionable thing about it without them
like spurging the fuck out and just being like there's reasons for everything it's
it's a it's a mess and a half i love kajima i love every middle gear game except for
which is kind of flawed in a lot of ways but death stranding is just not it really isn't a game
for everyone it's not even a game for like 90 percent of the population it's just a game for
like people who really like deep art movies and people that will unquestionably purchase
everything kajima puts out you're gonna probably piss off a few more people again you'll be all
right you'll find something to respond to it's gonna be great that's what my channel fucking
lives for wait until i make my video motherfucker it's gonna be like 90 minutes and i'm just gonna
piss off everyone i don't care it's a really bad game making a long man there are games you give
monster hunter is fucking great you go out and you just murder shit and stylishly and effectively
and quickly as possible and then you you take their skin and bones and meat and make armor out
of it and then you get to go back huh who are we making boners out of uh monsters from monster
hunter world oh i bet monsters got big old boners oh yeah oh yeah and it's a good game and
the death stranding is just like yeah there's interesting things in between but as the court
gameplay loop it's fucking tedious as hell and everything about it bb doesn't matter if fucking
bb dies the only thing you lose the ability to see the bts which you can still see without him as
soon as they start to rush towards you you just crouch and hold your breath and oh holy shit
they're not a fucking threat if they trigger a void out and they blow up an entire area guess
what that's a benefit now because now you don't have to deal with the bts anymore you can just
stroll through the whole fucking area without them even being an issue sure you lose all of
your your cargo but if you just set it aside somewhere slightly far away trigger the void
out go back and pick it up congratulations now you can bypass the entire area without
fucking running into bts there's just so many things about it that aren't balanced and there's
things that get in your way for no other reason other than to claim that it's fucking balanced
it's just oh just admit that it's not a perfect game oh my god no it's kajima it is perfect
this is this is to go even further beyond like if you're gonna have a if you're gonna have a
really repetitive gameplay loop then it needs to be either complex or there needs to be a really
high skill ceiling and it needs to be difficult so that i can go back and i can play risk of rain
over and over i could play vermintide over and over you know i could play stuff like that over
and over and over again yeah like it has to be a satisfying gameplay loop and when your gameplay
loop is delivering packages to to fucking limp dick npc's that look at you and go oh thanks
you've really helped us out it's like give me a fucking nursery like an abandoned nursery with
like some documents left behind from the people that used to live there give me something to
believe that this was a real world you can't just make an empty world and say oh my god look it's so
empty it's so beautiful imagine what life used to be like here no that's not fucking compelling
enough it's just a giant plane and all the npc's there it's like oh look there's junji ito hey
that's cool you're not going to do anything cool with him okay are you saying oh konno brian's in
the game does world building better than idio kajima yes absolutely undeniably
oh i'm i'm really gonna enjoy making that video i can't wait until it's on pc
yeah i mean i'm sure it'll play way better on pc like metal gear 5 on ps4 was good and then
they brought it to pc and it's like i didn't know a game could control this perfectly
metal gear solid 4 uh sorry did i say four i meant five five four oh yeah it it was they
capped it at 60 fps which is unfortunate but luckily it's not like one of those games
that you need high fps obviously be better but it also means i could just crank it up to 4k instead
and like nothing changes like 60 is the cap anyway so i guess this is gonna play at 4k then all right
someone said love how er is checked out yeah er do you have any opinion on death stranding whatsoever
you know i haven't played it haven't played most of the dude's games
yeah opinion on the japanese yeah i'll hear that um two bombs was probably not enough yeah no
absolutely also someone said the zone of the enders is kajima's someone said zone of the enders
was kajima's best work i i agree zone of the enders one and two are great you can play zone
of the enders too in vr it's fantastic very you're um you're gaining fans while simultaneously
gaining people who hate you i think in chat good some people like yeah rant more about the game
some people like chase fucking idiots are talking about you chase the fuck up that's what i fucking
live for it's from it's like i'm sorry i'm right yeah no someone said i really like hartman though
okay there's a kid yeah there's a character in death stranding named hartman his whole premise
is that he has a thing that like like a defibrillator that stops his heart for like 60 seconds at a time
so he can go to the afterlife and try to search for like his family or something like that
and his name is hartman and he lives next to a lake that is shaped like a heart it is just
alliteration to wow that's subtle yeah it's real subtle man all right by heart lake they make you
they make you spend like fucking 15 minutes in a cutscene with this dude while he goes in and out
of a death state for like three separate times and you have to wait in real time and look around
his office and examine all amazing pieces in his room while you wait for him to come back from the
afterlife it is just the most disrespectful thing of the player's time everything about
a dick if he has company over and he's choosing that time to do this yeah and he comes back and
he's like i must document my findings and there's there's things where like it like at first i i
thought it was cool because there's there's enemies in the game called mules we don't know
why they want to like knock you out and take your packet there's no reason is given they're
just crazy fedex workers okay whatever and then if you kill them they can trigger a void out
supposedly and spawn a bunch of bts which are like the ghost things uh i have left one out for a week
of real real time like just left my ps4 on for a week they never trigger anything so there's
literally no repercussion for killing anyone in metal gear solid at least like you know you'd lose
points are like you would make the end longer and metal gear solid three like there are all
sorts of reasons not to kill people you could get more things at the end and a better score
and everything like i said but in death stranding there's no reason and it's not even satisfying to
kill people or like tranquilize them or whatever it's just there's no reason to use stealth because
it's so out of the way there's a million and one problems i'm done talking about it no one mentioned
death stranding anymore i'm done with it let's fucking move on you know we we just keep dragging
you back into it it's definitely not something you're bringing up that is true someone said
heart someone said heart man and it just fucking it triggered me um family and i saw the rise of
skywalker dad fell asleep bored mum was confused throughout my sister unironically thinks it's one
of the worst written movies and this just ends with a smiley face and rag hey yeah i feel all
through this it's me hello er hi rags hey and hello all my lengthoids hope y'all have a great
new year and bend quenton over and spank his naked peepee i got drunk today no i know it's somebody
would i got drunk today i made a tutorial for an irish coffee so i'm drunk and happy j long bone
more onion boy vids please um she might make another one considering this stuff is having
with chris hansen right like who knows oh my god plenty to work with uh quinton's voice softens
like he's lost all confidence while saying how easy it is to make fun of nazis like he's worried
the KKK and er our next door and we'll beat him up and take his lunch money i think it's safe to
assume that was the case she's not a power ranger she's a common rider is that an animu
common rider that sounds like an animu it's it's like show yeah it's basically like power rangers
but uh i think it's like the og one it's still going to this day i don't know anything about it
except it's like live action and like really over the top and ridiculous comedic fans are
fans are very out there they must be destroyed um quinton's being very nazi ski with this
hatred hatred for the nazis nazi ski nazi ish i think is what they probably would want nazi ski
yeah he was he became very nazi ish and he hated women he hated different races it was disgusting
quinton gets some help that is that's my opinion that is you can't say it's wrong it's my opinion
of course it was supposed to be rose power rangers are asian
danny devito kissing fin in tlj would have made it the best movie ever oh dude i would have paid
to see that trading out of rose tico in the world but danny devito in tlj i would actually on
i'm wrong to say that movie was awesome just like running around the death star well the the
supremacy with fin and stuff he's in the casino planet can you imagine reacting to all the aliens
in the casino planet that'd be so great whoa wants to wants to play dice they get arrested
for a parking ticket in that movie so you get arrested for a parking violation yeah damn is
it bad for any reminder that das bullshit is a black woman where did that come from is that a mean
that i missed was that from the previous video maybe it was i don't know everything is blending
together um anyone see esquire's top 40 star wars characters list babu frick and the can
yeah i know right um babu frick and the cantina band guys were ahead of mon mothma and qui-gon
was only one spot above gin or so kill me oh well oh babu frick should have been number one
obviously obviously the cantina band i guess you could draw them in for number one i'm okay with
that but no i had not seen that list uh general pride was also supposed to be rose you should
just do this with all characters like fucking general pride man all of his scenes everyone
knows that was supposed to be rose tico rose tico would have made a beautiful general pride
hello all my e walks well that tells you where we are in the stream
oh my goodness damn you both for making me think of quinton's pp and nip chocolate
pp and nip chocolate you're welcome i couldn't fucking stand palpatine in episode nine it was
obviously supposed to be rose and ray was several spots above luke on that esquire list
what they put ray above luke they no they didn't what how does ray be anybody
yes but they put ray above luke apparently check it out esquire's top 40 star wars characters
if you just google that tell me if they put ray above luke
hello all my e words
drinker is streaming right now about tros is he nigh yeah has he no oh
he's still streaming oh i think he's finished now four hours what a long man
yes you know you know we call that a good start
mm-hmm uh j long bone please give e chat an n-word pass thank you oh she would she's already
provided several i believe you just you can you guys can see it next to your seats if you just
pick up that pass you will restock them as well she likes to uh with this arch chud quinton like
or hate gay villains and does that make him homophobic either way yeah that's that's tough
on one hand it's diverse on the other hand you've made them bad guys so you just you can't really
what do you guys reckon is that a win or a lose for the progressive crowd a gay villain
i don't know i wish they had like rules and standards we could use to judge but that's
that ain't good it's a lose because what they'll say is that further villainizes uh gaze as being
like a um like a like a rogue sort of uh god what's the word i i saw an exact thread about
it where people were saying like it makes it seem like it's it's this sort of alternate culture of
like depravity and and it is though it is though but yeah just it would like paint gaze in front
because there was like a big thread about disney villains or or whatever just like villains as a
whole and all the you know there's a gay villain that like further dehumanizes them or something
i think that's the line of thinking of course yep uh what series do you think has the most
satisfying finale and you can't say breaking bad everyone says that
um which one of the jedi ended in 1983 well do they mean tv alone are we allowed movies or no
if it's the question again sorry most satisfying ending to a tv show and i guess we can open it
up to movie series if you want hmm can i include anime because no we mean content we need real
stuff i'm sorry real content good media you know what i mean like because anime was just
just terrible just awful that's all that's left it's evil is what i might say
but uh yeah satisfying endings that's tough there's hardly any long-running tv shows that
end satisfying ways uh i would go with angel probably i liked how funnily enough i liked how
the office us ended it was quite a nice ending for a show that was sort of fine um i liked by
the way he said is it like the obvious choice is breaking bad i like breaking bad's ending i wasn't
particularly like over the top shocked or anything by it in terms of how good it was i was
just like yep this felt about right oh everything dies the meteor hits unknown seas are coming
expected some character deaths but literally the whole human race man they just seemed over the
top the uh community tv show the end of season five they they don't know if they're getting renewed
like in terms of the actual like production and stuff and like the last episode when the character
says like um i wonder if we're gonna make it in terms of like implying for the next year next
season sort of thing and i think a character says like well if we if we don't a meteor hit and that
would be canon just like what um what's up what about buffy i'm 50 50 on buffy's ending i like
it enough i also dislike a lot of things about it but angels is like fucking perfect uh i don't
think of what the problem is so many tv shows don't end well because they sort of sputter out
when they end yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna fucking go against the rules here because it is technically
tv but the anime erased or bokudaka inai machi which technically translates to the town in which
only i do not exist chernobyl ended well chernobyl yeah that's a statement i never thought i would say
it's interesting because he raced in the anime that was like really bad because they rushed it
but if you read the manga or watch like the netflix live action adaptation it really it's like a very
whole complete ending where it sort of like wraps up all the loose ends and that's the only thing
that comes to mind off the top of my head i can't really think of anything else that
ended super neatly in a satisfying way obviously breaking bad but i think what i like the most
about breaking bad was that towards the end everything just devolved so suddenly with
everyone hating uh walter wow spoiling it oh what the fuck it's like fucking a decade old at this
point wow even though he asked you specifically he did ask it was going to have this guy's mouth
saying that the netflix adaptation was improving i mean that's i haven't seen it people have like it
looked like shit because it was live action and every time japanese people try to portray
anime characters live action it's always a nightmare but in terms of like the story like
being more complete yeah it was supposedly an improvement we'll see a few trauma ended really
well their last episode was good shit um any other suggestions for anybody um
episodes that ended satisfyingly
i don't watch that many shows that's the thing yeah i think we've we've given the same enough
answer i think we did okay yeah born order saved star wars for me after watching riser skywalker
i played it and it reminded me of what star wars is and what it can be it it isn't great but it
made me want to watch the ot again i think riser skywalker is bombing thanks jj
i don't think it's bombing from what i've seen it's not bombing if not it's doing fine if not
doing pretty good i think uh from what i've seen on updates about just box office which isn't
it's not a huge surprise i was just hoping it wouldn't go above a billion because it would show
that things are changing slowly a benchmark people pay attention to
yeah like cracking a billion means that you you're doing something great and it's like that they're
not though uh this super chat says hour three so that's where we're at guys made it three hours
into the stream now while we are eight hours and 45 minutes into it so getting there if they wanted
asian representation they'd have a character a chinese character who didn't like the other black
characters or the gays there you go yeah everyone wins no maul you have to have a character that's
just the best possible did you ever see um fuck what's his name not patrice o'neill but the guy
who voiced ratatouille what's his name pat and oswald pat and oswald he had a great bit where
he was talking about i want to play a gay character on a sitcom or like i want to write a gay character
on a sitcom but no one will ever pick it up because he has to be the most like every gay
character it's like sassy and resourceful and witty and it must put a lot of pressure on gay
gay people in real life so i just want to make him absolutely useless like he just never has any
he's always just crude and perverted and like there's nothing redeeming about him
oh obviously he hates gay people then yeah yeah
star wars nazis mr quinton this is dominoes oh yeah he just he rants to whoever's gonna listen
i guess uh clearly he meant his wife's husband's kids oh yeah clearly clearly is this a troll
video is quinton trying satire again no no this was genuine i i would assume i can't know for
certain but i i assume yeah you could hear the genuine resignation in his voice
uh i would have liked it if rose had an angry rant at fin tearfully asking why he'd rather sniff
after some of the skinny bitch who barely remembers he exists while he's not around rose
should hate ray i think everybody should really be frustrated with her i like you know what's
funny about it right um in the opening of the film poe is pissed at her because she's not like
focusing her efforts correctly or what you would say correctly as in like they're they're fledgling
the resistance against the first order they're going on these missions and stuff and she's just
fucking around i'm watching him be like you know what are you doing like you need to help us i was
like man that's like some genuine conflict that makes sense because she's a fucking idiot who
doesn't know what she's doing and she's really strong like if rose like genuinely resented ray
and they had this like mini b plot about that i feel like i would actually add something yeah
that would be interesting yeah and at this point it would be interesting i would like if we were
trying to fix this if i'd be like we need so much more time because i'd like to actually explore it
like in a detailed way have all these characters have these like issues with her that keep presenting
and she picks up on it and then she's just like she's a partially convinced they're just jealous
of the fact that she's so powerful then it's it's also maybe it is also that maybe some people
really are like how is it that you got to be so powerful it's not fair and stuff like that and
it's like oh my god character conflict what in the world remember that remember when they did that
hooray hooray imagine the lgbt scene but they're just fucking there just two of them having sex in
the middle of the celebration we were like just making like a pair of shears right on the next
wing now just like an extended like 10 minute long my passionate like voyeuristic sex scene
in the middle of a group and it's it's celebrations you get like trumpets that were cheering and then
hard cut to passion at 10 minute sex and then cut back just hard like just the only person
really watching is lando like everyone else is ignoring it except him he's just going
what did you guys notice how many times in the movie lano would just say something and then go
yeah it seemed like that's what they could get him to do well was just laugh let's do it chewy
yeah yeah you did that already yeah because they cut they cut to him when he first arrives he does
that and then when they cut to him later when he's like we're gonna pick them up because
poe is like i'm really fast don't worry that he's like not as fast as us let's do it chewy
yeah
it's all really funny to you isn't it lando glad this is very serious dude he's just
fucking senile he's barely there um i'll always hate tlj over riser skywalker riser skywalker is
damage control for tlj if it weren't for tlj we probably wouldn't be in this mess again there's
a lot of rationales for picking the probably film and i don't necessarily think any of them are
like invalid or anything it's just really interesting to see people try and pick
yeah i have the reverse rationale yeah i have i think that being so shamelessly
like anti-star wars tlj is just slightly more respectable
what you think riser skywalkers anti-stars
well i think they're all anti-star wars fundamentally but
that's more pandering more deceptive that's what i'm trying to get at
ryan johnson clearly just wanted to subvert what came before i kind of respect that a little bit
sort of way
oh i'm i'm i'm kind of the opposite i i think that ryan johnson is far more malicious of an
actor than jj abrams is i just think jj can't tell stories and he's terrible at making movies
i think ryan johnson specifically really tried this is what i mean about the complex nature of
this discussion because it's like is jj worse for having propped up the corpse of the ot that
he's essentially undertaken and been like look he's still alive look he's just like you remember
him or is ryan worse for pissing on the corpse and setting it on fire but being open about it
he's like that's what i've just done it's like um it's there's lots of ways you could sort of
break it down as far as i'm concerned i still think tlj is the the one that i would have the
most issue with out of the three of the sequels just because of the fact that just seems to come
from a creator that wanted to fuck star wars into the dirt just fuck it piece of shit show
needs you needs to be this now because star wars is broken as it is anyway or something while
jj was like trying to pretty up this mess and resell it which is gross still but it's like
it's just i guess it's down to the original person what you really think about it
yeah no i gotta shit's fucked yo they're both they both pretty much fucked it
yeah no i agree with that for sure ryan johnson is slightly more
open who's obvious about what he was doing so was hitler he did nothing i would think that you
under i guess that explains why you know you kind of understand you know sympathizes with ryan
because he's also a fan of hitler like hitler i was saying you had the man had ideas
yeah i i get it like the idea he's trying to do uh something significant and different and
everything it's just that holy shit like i think they both fail miserably at trying to achieve
what they wanted to and so it's almost like we like so what are the motivations then we can
decide who the worst one is like the guy who's just trying to resell nostalgia or the guy who's
trying to destroy and rebuild something else and i just don't appreciate the whole destroy pot
at all i think he's an asshole go make your own fucking thing for the decrepit old man who hates
everything and betrayed his family go go have fun with that your own movie
uh we're the knights of ren the um uh the other padawans that were taken from jedi training
temple in tlj that means ben finished the job he started so i guess the knights of ren were just
like because they seem to be hanging out in one of the flashbacks in the um the padawan place yeah
oh is that just where it wasn't there like a bit with where luke was with r2 and then
kylo and the knights of ren were there maybe that's just like a fuck up combination of memories or
something rather than what the fuck was the knights of ren what even was that they were
what were they where were they from a bunch of jedi are they force sensitive they don't have
lightsabers bunch of dudes with some weapons that kylo because he said like i'm taking my
knights and it's like you're knights so like you are there are later scenarios that you hired or
something i i don't know what to think i haven't been given up enough information to think things
it's fucked by the time quinton has kids lol hey man you know impossible things it can happen yeah
it's not impossible i get raped someone uh oh wow uh not caught up with the stream so don't know
if you have already talked about this or answered the question but what are all of your thoughts on
the witcher show personally i did not like it i've not seen it uh we haven't seen it i haven't
at least kind of on our our watch list sort of i haven't seen it curious a bit poisoned against
netflix so i heard people saying that um uh i heard people saying that like they sort of uh
like they got a lot of the characters wrong in um the netflix show i heard people saying
gerald says like nothing at all gerald yeah gerald what did i say gerald i said gerald i just didn't
say gerald gerald there's no gerald is it i thought it was it was gerald gerald yeah it is i just don't
care about the witcher you're a bad person obviously i mean probably is that it is that all
you're gonna say jeez yeah pretty much basically all right terrible yeah we'll we'll check it out
at some point and then have things to say all right red worship the actual blade of the lightsaber
also you got uh jj retcon the entire routine rise of skywalker to retell the same story from the
narrative of a woman i'd say that's worse again you got a lot of things that have been murdered
and destroyed and thing in uh in tlj as well again not saying the blame doesn't go to both
wouldn't want to imply that at all but um you know tlj was the one that broke the whole
force ghosts thing it broke hyperspace broke space battles broke luke
i would argue tsa broke a whole bunch more
you really think pretty much undid every victory from return of the jedi
uh palpatine was still dead though and the empire re-rising i actually do think it's
possible for the empire to coalesce after the destruction of the emperor
the context was always going to decide exactly how much damage they actually did tfa was
quote unquote smart to not be definitive about how specific things happened they ruined han
they were very definitive about that but exactly what the first order are and how they rose and
who snoke is these were things that could have made it a lot easier to digest but after the
three films it's as simple as they're just the emperor the empire and the emperor still exists
none of it was good
they're all disasters it's just really hard to pick out the worst one
the question about her parentage was never about who they were she wanted to meet them and
eventually got over it at the end of tfa their identity was relevant for the story not necessarily
for ray um you didn't really get over it though if you consider tlj unless is that what we're
talking about like because tfa i would happily agree that she essentially gets over it from the
vague amount of time we spent with her about it but tlj she like it just resets like doesn't
kylo and here like they discuss the whole like saw it in thingy and then you're now you're going
to try and find it in luke whatever just the parentage thing it's such a nightmare to actually
go through because all three films have such a different idea on exactly what's going on with
her parents twice um thanks to you guys i tripled my grade on my final analytic essay from last year
from a 28 to 80 92 without errors keep it up excellent that's awesome that's really good to
hear glad to hear you putting it to use uh no one expects the dog cockroach inquisition
oh yeah when that just randomly popped up yeah
finish the dog video davit go back to the dog video even its ass is better than quinton's face
damn can we see what eric butts yeah i figured that we'd probably be okay with that as a statement
like any disagreements here guys as for for finishing the dog video no just the uh the dogs
the dog's butt would be a better look than uh uh oh winton's face of course absolutely it would
be i mean yeah i have no idea what this video is but i have to assume yeah yeah just go with it
can we see what eric butts thought of rise of skywalker again i don't know that it'll be
interesting to watch i think it's just gonna be here being like yeah i mean we could we could
watch the first bit off stream and see if it's yeah we can give it the old chakaru see what it's like
um if the first script used mortis were ray and kylo going to be the mortal
incarnations of the daughter and the son if so jj copied zelda skyward sword
uh perhaps he did perhaps he did what's with the weird sextal in the background
he's got a video on it uh he apparently crowdfunded buying a sextal i don't know why but
that's something that happened uh back from lumberjacking again no poison oak this time
good to see you guys live again hope you're doing well oh and sans is in smash brothers
excellent i had no idea
uh ray and harry potter are both mary sues one is just in a better book
is harry potter mary sues doesn't he get fucked up a lot he is
i mean even just like ray he dies comes back spoiler alert
um he might he might tick some boxes but uh i feel like she ticks a lot more than he does
and a lot more consistently doesn't he get bailed out by people a lot like hamani
yeah but you can argue that's just part of his
his ability really oh yeah all the time he gets bailed out there's always something around to
save him because he's the chosen one
ever noticed that the vast majority of star wars memes come exclusively from episode three in the
clone wars there's a few from uh from episode one and two right i think i mean the yeah the vast
majority though yeah story right yeah i'm sure episode three's got some top memes
read a different book as a beginning has an end ripped off shad's book
yeah yeah that's true got him my phone screen last cracked then his mind
my phone screen less cracked than his mind oh i get it phone screen is less cracked
than his mind i and i understand uh your voldemort's grandson harry
that could have been a big reveal that it would have improved it
naturally assuming voldemort was a clone and he made a clone just sit in his throne
he fucked snakes star wars a rip off of harry potter what are these dumbasses
gonna say next vader's a rip off of robocop
uh why are the sex dolls hands twisted all the way around
reverse hand job the implications of what quidd did to that doll's hands
in order to cripple it how do you review a set you will have to have fucked it
in order to have a review of it i get i haven't seen his video on it i don't know if he says that
but that's got to be what he does right um i i think it's natural that someone won't do that
and yeah uh chase would you like to talk a bit about your channel before you end up ejecting
your tisms tisms uh yeah i review video games and uh rarely anime uh my mic sounds a little
bit better on my channel than it does on streams for some reason uh i just cover stuff that i like
i usually go into detail about whether they're really good or really bad or somewhere in the
middle and uh use a lot of art from a very talented artist that i pay money to and i try
to make it entertaining at least even if you disagree with me uh but more more importantly
than that go buy monster hunter world uh iceborn the expansion pack is coming out uh january
is very good it is a thoroughly enjoyable uh hack and slash action game with uh if you don't
mind grinding it's very very good and uh yeah uh down with uh down with the blacks so that's oh
that's neat oh that's great that's right you know what to end on um yeah link in the chat
and in the description there's plenty of videos to have a look through see if you find someone to
either agree on or get pissed at him for either way very depreciate it if you want a good barometer
for whether or not you'll enjoy my content go watch my evil within video i had to disable
comments temporarily because everyone's uh being a fucking idiot but uh yeah if you can make it through
that video i sure did i silenced them forever you took their right so um yeah thanks for having
me though it was really fun uh i had a very good time thanks for coming for nine hours
er was good hearing you talk like 15 times very enlightening very enjoy um thank you
and uh thank you chat for enduring my fucking spurg about uh death stranding and i'm sorry
it's all right we shall see you around mr chase all right bye later
thank god he's gone thank god now we can have some fun yes all right speaking of fun
here we go all of leah's scenes should have been rose ones you can argue the rose rose trains
ray rose enters the force to try and convince kylo not to kill ray and you're like why i don't
what that's why he was so confused when uh he drops his saber he was just like what the fuck
like who is who you why are you and she's like kylo don't kill ray it all makes sense be a bitch
there is an amazon show with a possessed protagonist coming out in a little while
and it might be awesome all right uh some toxic supremacy bucks for you massives i have to train
someone all night looking forward to the 36 hour quintentisms they they were tismy indeed
um put a baby in me palpatine and ray's body oh i don't know if that's how that works but
palpe's just force healed his sheave duh quinton you can't heal yourself right because that that
wouldn't surely that wouldn't make sense well can you how does that work
maybe if you have one of them pair bonds force bonds the ads could you that's off your own arm
and heal it so that it grows a person out of it and then that person heals you to get your
arm back to full power oh god could you imagine they introduced that eventually because they're
just bored at this point they want to fuck around i don't know this is just a thing now
um he's too dangerous to be kept alive this isn't the jedi way tell you what i'll let you
break one jedi code if you let me kill him can i marry senator padme amidal that's suspiciously
specific but all right deal saga over well not quite because he assumed she would be dying
regardless you know so you'd still be upset about it all but um i wouldn't have mad anyway mace
would have killed what a clone or he would have hurt him to the point where he thinks he's dead
only for him to survive people thinking they can kill palpatine how silly hmm would have been
better if they'd had ray die and kylo redeem himself and beat palpatine would have made the
ending scene better too for him to become a hermit and take the skywalker name um he's already
a skywalker i mean yeah technically so i kind of agree i i like the idea of race like unironically
right i was like ray dying i think would have made for a better ending well yeah just god is she
such a worthless character uh characters survive things they shouldn't knives solve plot problems
villain is killed easily selfish main female who is sexually attracted to her nephew this is just
game of thrones with space wizards ironic too true imagine if it turned out hitler was just a puppet
and it was kaisa willhelm all along and the pause of world war two doesn't matter well i thought
that's what they were going to do expectations palpatine was going to like send ray back in time
back to world war two i thought that was going to be the ending they went with but i i guess not
uh episode 12 needs to end with sheaves lightning being redirected back into his face it's the most
consistent theme of the third movie of each trilogy oh yeah did you catch that he's had
like his lightning up in his face at the end of all three trilogies now yeah i guess it wore him
down each time until it blew him up like uh he just couldn't handle it the third time
i had a seizure when i saw the ewoks i just what i saw them i was just like uh whatever
how would you guys fix this trilogy how do you fix this trilogy you just have to delete it right
it's too late yeah you bored it you got to get rid of it you can't fix all three of these movies
damage it's insane like if you're talking about keeping it all canon and then moving on it's like
how the hell do you do that why would you want to do that i think you'd just be like hey that's um
all it uh you know what do they do is star trek the something timeline or whatever just call it
like a timeline of some kind i am here what am i sorry door that's all right uh we were just
saying the super chat asked how would you fix this trilogy and i was like start right start
from beginning right because i don't think it's possible to fix it but i think that to try and
avoid pissing everyone off this will still piss people off that love tlj whatever but you call it
like the um the ray timeline or something like that you'd be like yeah that's that's totally a
storyline yes that totally anyway we're gonna take go from episode six to a different place uh now
we're gonna call it the whatever else timeline you know so that you don't necessarily have to decan
a thousand years in the future yeah probably um for instance the things that the roman empire
did have a lasting impact on the world today let's go a thousand years in the star wars future
and all of the stuff that our beloved characters did it still has an impact on the galaxy it was
very very important but you don't have to fuck with it in order to have it became legendary
and uh yeah uh worst case scenario though i should be like yeah just decanonize it fuck it
if enough time passes i think people will get over it like sorry we're decanonizing it it's
fine let's make a new one and it doesn't have to yeah it doesn't have to have anything to do with
the characters of the ot what up my ewok words thoughts on rain of fire maybe efap movies
hi rags hey i haven't seen that in a long time i'd be uh i'd be interested in checking it out again
very cool movie and surprisingly good effects uh in certain parts i rewatched it with wolf about
a year ago and we were both like wow there's some shots in this movie the dragons look fucking
great even though it's really old uh some not so much though um it's like 50 50 but yeah this is
it's a fine movie there's a couple of tisms in it but um i liked it a lot you masses had to start
well go ahead sorry i've never seen it it's um the premises dragons essentially take over the
world they it's a post-apocalyptic movie where dragons are just everywhere someone someone in
my server said asked if i could say quinton eats dirty wieners so there you go there you go
i remember it i i remember liking it it's just it's been so long since i've seen it
you masses had to start while i was working oh well take my paycheck
oh uh long man good thank you hi rags hey hi er hello hi weekend warrior and j long bone
sorry i'm not familiar with you chase oh efap is the best gift of the year why i'm glad you and
you have enjoyed um it has been a wonderful year of efapping the entire trilogy was stuff happening
without the natural consequences so finn steers in horror at his fellow soldier dying and then
shouts whoo while he gleefully murders the rest of them in the rest of the trilogy yeah yep yep
also hi rags hello hello my meme mess meme mess meme stick meme meme mastic
brood meme meme stick brood i'm going right uh i would like to recommend the video or book that
discuss all the unique weaponry that the knights of ran possess in the movie but still get their
asses kicked by one guy yeah but he's kylo yeah i mean they their weapons they can't deal with a
lightsaber like they're fucked if you have a bunch of guys with blasters oh yeah what i was trying to
say is like is like no matter let's say you go like super skilled karate man versus guy with
lightsaber it'd be pretty tough for karate man to do anything and then you you include the
fact that karate man has like an axe you're like okay that's something but lightsaber man is
extremely experienced and powerful now he also has telekinesis you're like uh yeah they're not
winning remember that bit rags where he puts the sword at his back and waits for someone to hit it
and they do yes weird really weird that is really weird
and then what are they going to do it gets the guy with the gun
um aaron eha supported zutara wake up senpai
that's not conclusive but yeah it's not looking good
that's pretty much the ralo of avatar oh i know i know pieces of that thanks to your videos
i'm i am a weird passive uh observer of the avatar world at this point i will become fully
inaugurated soon enough i'm sure yes you will officer what did he look like quinton he was an
ewok and tall white shirt jean shorts officer ewok quinton he had dark skin oh my god
the lines i am all the fifth and i am all the jedi sound like what a couple of three
year olds playing fighting would say i have laser gun yeah well i have anti-laser shield
shake my head yes it's pretty awful uh just wanted to say as a diabetic boy i find the
diabeto memes to be insanely hilarious also mary xmas everybody hi rags hello mary xmas and i'm
glad you're enjoying the memes uh well that's all you need quinton after five seconds of sex
that's his apparently that's his catchphrase it's uh i've quitted reviews and that's all you need
that's what he says oh yeah okay also so we'll just put it out he advertises patreon that takes
a month off i guess they'll wait uh diabeto says it's eight out of ten his blood sugar blood sugar
level is high i think you'll come down on that because of all of his like respected friends
hating the movie he's probably like okay okay maybe um er if a third avatar series opened with
a social darwinist village killing kora in a fight villain sorry not village killing kora in
a fight and the new avatar has a brother would you watch it you had me for killing kora but i
don't know what a brother the new avatar has a brother would you watch it yeah i'm not sure

on for your mandalorian roast uh yeah does he hate it or like it or i don't yeah i don't know um but
i'll try and get uh him on at some point i believe he said he's uh afraid i'm not he's i think he's
also invited me to call into his show at some point i have to figure it out uh ryan johnson is
the kind of guy to play telephone and purposefully change the phrase to subvert your expectations
yes my last request to the prison guard i want to watch all of efap before my execution
also hi rags hi raggers hello and uh i don't know if they'll grant that request but hopefully we'll
have made enough by then that it'll take you so long to finish them while we're still making more
that you can die of old age first hooray movie bob needs his disney health insurance eight out of ten
i mean it's just like i said it's just odd to me i really don't get how he gave it that rating
but all right uh i was nine in 77 i have been at every movie with my brother then and since
the last jedi killed that i no longer care we just gave up sad huh yeah yeah yeah oh let me
uh er's take is this review makes him long for death
it's only natural yes don't worry a lot of people feel that way it's fun so er does the rise of
skyle waker finally answer the jq or will we have to wait for a different film to finally deal with
them hi ragakin the jedi question the jedi question yeah well it appears that ray is off the jedi
there you go and they all yeah they all went into here i guess i don't know what that means
for the the the jedi question exactly well that she seemed to be pretty unconscious sort of
staring at the sky i don't know yeah that's a little messy do you wipe standing from front to back
how many uh no it's not typically standing no front to back i mean you know maybe experiment
standing uh why not side to side about that do people do people try that i don't know
in terms of how many maybe sometimes just do half a one see how it feels just that or seven seven
several billion um english is not my first language but i can understand ben shapiro just
fine movie blob however or movie bob sorry they actually didn't say movie blob that's just
automatically thrown it now apparently however gives me brain cancer thank you so much mauler
for how you talk in your videos it's a joy to listen oh i'm glad you enjoy it sorry that i can't
stay i'm going off to make some content but have some money also say hi to shad for me i'm trying
my hand at writing good stuff and uh absolutely dad always likes uh hello i believe you guys seen
the ob one vader reimagined fight i have uh it's pretty neat i haven't i guess it's like a fan made
thing where they sort of it's much more uh dynamic the fight much less like two old dudes with sticks
ah i see cinema robertos diabetes and bad complexion are a warning sign about swallowing
everything hollywood gives you i'm looking at you too caverns basey oh bilge in rogue one the emperor
or the empire are mining the crystals for the death star's weapon and needed shit turns from
that one place where did they get the crystals to fuel those damn stars destroyers if they were
hidden um did you see the red letter me to discussing that he like created those with
the force or whatever like they were theorizing that he could just like generate star destroyers
with the force oh i mean honestly it kind of looked like that didn't it i just thought they
were built in an we don't fucking know the ground yes like were they built underground and he
force lifted all of them up from an underground cavern which is pretty insane but okay kind of nuts
kind of nuts not gonna lie is both fucking stupid oh yeah then the idea that he can just generate
them thousands of star destroyers you can just generate like whoa that's uh jesus an impressive
power to say the least and you wonder of what the additional applications of such a fucking thing
would be but um i suppose we'll find out for sure in future installments where they they totally
tell us exactly what all of it meant i watched troy for the first time in six years and really
enjoyed it i was curious who adapted the story into a screenplay and david benioff can you tell
oh wait uh yeah i david benioff and dan wyce right that's the names of the the game of thrones
people this is the thing man if anyone says like can't believe they've actually made something
joyous like well hey they did pretty well with game of thrones up to a point so uh there's
obviously we've got you know the people being like uh guy who made joker made the hangover movies we
can't be that good and then you've got ridley scott made prometheus and daily it's like people
are capable of doing great stuff and terrible stuff yeah yeah they really are um also can you
tell er that i love him and ask if he likes the fate series er uh this guy asked uh super chat he
wanted to let you know that he loves you and he wanted to ask what you think about the fate series
uh fate series i didn't i haven't read it but i've watched fate stay night and fate zero
and they're both pretty good
massives we need a mando review my opinion the first season ended with a really rushed
conclusion and half of the episode should have been in season two hope it improves but i'd like
to hear your thoughts i think that you're already off to a good start i feel like most of the
episodes were crap the majority of them were filler the ending was kind of insane in terms
of there's so much i'd i'd have to criticize for it i really liked the first episode
yeah i liked the first episode a whole lot yeah i like the first two
and the rest kind of put it off
uh they should play movie bob videos on repeat at cia black site prisons to torture sand people
oh man they will beg yeah i agree
uh ah my brothers alive again good movie bob plays hard rock because he has erectile dysfunction

uh oh please buy the domain please for movie bob.com also hello rags hello to for movie
to for movie bob and rags any divinity original sin 2 tips um honestly i would experiment with a
lot of mods the base game is pretty good but i think some of there's a particular overhead
overhaul mod let me actually see if i can look it up real quick that really does a lot to make the
game fresh and interesting um i would say that yeah experiment with mods that you think are fun
try to do everything do every fight do every mission it helps out a lot um uh do what you can
to you know to to lock up enemies with disabling abilities so freeze them stun them you know that
sort of thing as much as you possibly can um you want to really make the turn economy go in your
favor uh prepare a lot uh i mean there's a lot that goes into that game uh there there's it's
it's hard to just start naming stuff but those would probably be the basics oh auto save all
the time f5 f5 f5 all the time before every fight do an auto save uh let me let me let me go to
steam here and look at the mods because while i'm here i wanna i do want to let you know about it
divinity original sin 2 now let's go to the workshop
let's see my files subscribed items um
uh i would do things like there's a lot of little stuff combat luck faster casting mages
summoning tweaks i have 35 harder classic mode um stuff like that to to balance out all the other
mods um i'm looking through my list here i wish there's an easy way to sort it
it doesn't seem like you can go ahead and carry on and i'll look through this and once i get it
i will let you know um i helping rags love the quickly down under reference
oh yeah man i'm glad you did i'm glad that there are people out there who know it uh do it hashtag
efapping to bob for the movie bob fund also 86 ron tomato score has been stuck at 86 for thousands
of reviews almost like ron tomatoes froze it at that yeah i mean if you ask me do you have
definitive proofs like no do you believe it's been tampered with absolutely oh yeah there's i
don't believe it for a second um okay the the mod is uh do s2 divine war and i think there's a divine
war compatibility patch that goes along with it um subscribe to those they have some really really
get overhauls of the attribute system armor um things like that i'm going through a play through
most recently with this on and i think that it's a fantastic uh way to go through the game so
go for it and then as you play because the first the first file you have probably won't be the one
you beat it on you'll play through and you'll play through and you'll play through and you'll
probably notice things that you'd like to change along the way and then just get mods for it and
kind of make the game that is most fun for you to play um just keep it tough keep it challenging
there's good mods that make it more difficult as well as give you more options and a lot of good
quality of life improvements for you but feel free to experiment with those go for it and just
just enjoy it all right um this goes to buying movie bob other super chat might not have gone
through um if i read it it went through i guess uh buy it and make it the efap website you cowards
i mean i i think that would be funny too um i could probably talk to kievakins about
potentials for that um to like take movie bob dot com and just have it redirect maybe
there's there's there's things we can do here um for movie bob the movie bob fund for the movie
bob fund funds to secure movie bob for the movie bob fund hello all my ewoks buy it do it for the
vine my favorite ewok was barted luther king jr um i'm doing my part keep up the great content
my ewoks oh and mcc and overload the anime is fantastic i've bought 10 books of the light novel
series um the only person with it oh there you go our anime expert on the panel does not know
i'm sorry whacking buy it yep a couple of guaps for my fellow ewoks five bucks to spread the efap
empire in life war and death peace in life shame and death atonement for the blob this money must
go to making bob depressed it would be you know what just the cherry on the cake would be any
acknowledgement from him and i imagine it would come in the form of like what low lives that they
they bought that and they did that those creatures um movie bob calm equals efap hate mongers of the
toxic brood for the movie bob calm also just finished the mandalorian tikiya i think they mean
tika is a good comedy director but one in the god emperors name was that opening scene
oh the one with the um the stormtroopers scout troopers yeah doing the thing where they can't
aim it's like i don't know man like uh i think shad wanted to talk to us about that whole thing
sort of in general but like just the idea that you have stormtroopers that are like confused at
how terrible their own aim is i'm like what is the gag here like you guys realize these are supposed
to actually that's a meme that they're bad at aiming you've made it like canon that's strange
okay that's all like to the point where they're questioning their own weapons they're like are
the weapons fucked or something and i know that a lot of people really like it i just i don't know
i feel like that um it's like a fourth wall sort of thing yeah i feel like there's no
reason to be afraid of them they're just completely incompetent like how are they able to
accompany how are they able to do anything the galactic empire my ass how there's so many of
them that's why we have a thousand of them shoot surely one of them will hit something
it's volley fire like the old days just massive lines
um i actually had fun watching riser skywalker i hated all the flaws but in the moment i had
fun do i have brain damage no i mean there were some there are some fun aspects to it sure i could
see why people i still think it's more palatable to an average general audience member than tlj is
last jedi absolutely i think it is without a doubt what do you think you are about that yeah
that's true i think it is designed to be that way yeah because tlj is so much more and this
is the thing i'm not actually this isn't actually me being critical tlj right now but there's a lot
more uh slow almost dour parts to the film while jj abrams is like whoa whoa wacky boom whoa
oh jj wacky boom have you guys seen the lighthouse and if not are you planning to
i want to see it i've heard very good things yeah we can see us here uh you have my donation
and my diabetes oh buy it here's for the movie bob dot com fund also rags have you played near
automata no i haven't played near automata yet it's good i've heard it's all right
uh hi molar hello may the dawn be with you all very kind very kind may the dawn be with you
might as well give my share to the fund after watch this terrible movie tonight but on the
flip side i'm definitely tipsy oh that'll help oh yes that will help better make this
happen my ewoks to moviebob.com er since you only fuck white women when do you do
when you do a money money shot on a white woman's face does the nut camouflage with her skin
what a question oh i mean you have to be really arian let's just say
i think white women aren't actually like white
well you can find some that are super pale you can find vampires i'm sure and just
oh yeah come all over vampires do you like vampires are you partial to vampires
more diabeto's fund hello all my e-words here's ten dollars for another great stream with a five
dollar deduction for breaking my two-year streak of not thinking about breccine oh well it happens
despite making up only 13 percent of andor's population oh there's two of those goodness
this is the one immediately after is 13 percent of ewoks kill 52 percent of stormtroopers on andor
very impressive why are you streaming on molar you massive uh where else would i stream
um i guess i could stream on molar that's probably going to be the backup plan if ever
i lose streaming privileges on my main channel uh chud skywalker looks like clarence
oh the little drawing we had i guess of chud skywalker if you remember
who's clarence yeah the is he the guy from grand theft auto oh possibly
um our five use my super chat moneys to buy that website a molarino and raga diddle hello hello
in the darth plaguers book palpatine's master manipulates the force in test subjects to create
life evil intentions and as a result the force creates anakin good i read the book years ago
not 100 good memory so darth plaguers was doing evil tisms and the force responded
by doing good tisms creating anakin i guess certainly unusual the films really don't uh
address much of that like staying away from it yeah poorly yeah because like it's just i had
there was no father movie yard la la la going on uh give the chat googly eyes oh yeah i get
well you know in the memes they could add that if they want uh ray should be palp's great great
grand uh great great sorry great granddaughter not granddaughter consider kylo is g son
grandson of vader while palpatine was a generation above vader during the prequels
there's ways to make it work probably maybe i think i'm close for that um to er have you seen
carbonary of the iron fortress i have it's like attack on titan but not quite as cool
but also on a train which is pretty cool uh it's it's a fun enough time killer soundtrack
person said it's it's essentially attack on titans with zombies and trains
yeah pretty much hey nifty why was leah looking for luke if she was already a jedi anyone think
of that i mean it's always helpful to have another one i guess i'm not against the idea
that she was looking for luke i imagine that i'd be pretty pissed if i was here is my issue with
it like what the hell did you go luke we need you the fuck yeah shit's going on and you're
kind of responsible yeah you find out that he's like well i left because you know the jedi kind
of suck and you're like oh did they oh and the sith they're they're pretty much the same or
or better yeah is that what is that what you're saying he's like no then you're like oh
maybe give us a hand then you asshole so get in the fucking speeder and come on
moviebob.com very appreciative of your videos do you think that
authorial intent goes into what a movie is viewed as objectively also by moviebob's website um so
i'm pretty much uh on board with death of the author entirely like
if just because uh the creator says this is what this is when it's clearly not that thing
like through a mistake or the fact that they really wanted to portray x but they ended up with y
um it's them saying it's that is about as relevant as anyone else saying it's that
the as soon as yeah if you if you paint a picture of a duck and you tell me it's the titanic i'm i'm
not no it's a duck mate sorry um it is more interesting i love to hear about it though say
for example like why did ryan johnson destroy kylo's mask and you you can find out like through
commentary or whatever that like he wanted to get rid of it because it sort of like gets in the way
and he's going to use it as an example of how kylo's growing as a character whatever and you're
like oh because i don't i don't know that like like quinton said that he sees that he's like a
fanboy evader and that that's like dumb and you should stop doing that but what we got in the film
was snoke was like humiliating him for wearing a silly mask and like i don't like that doesn't
follow me at all i'm just confused like if it was so you got all these different sources of what
could be the actual issue someone's interpretation the director explaining it to you as to what his
intention was and then following the actual dialogue in the scene and trying to conclude
something from it like it's really interesting to take it in um and it can maybe direct you to
certain elements that you may have missed like someone saying this is how it is then you go oh
shit yeah that line that kind of recontextualize or whatever but i'm sorry sometimes authors are
like oh shit no i meant for it to be this way not that way and then you're like yeah well this way
is like barely seeable from anybody's perspective so uh without like definitive references it's
complicated and i would probably want to go example by example um but you know like joker
is another one where people are like how much of it happened how much of it didn't
and as far as i'm aware the director's position and the writer's position is that all of it
happened except for the girlfriend um i think that i could be wrong on that i guess a better
example would be the taxi driver's ending is supposed to be literal uh from the perspective
of the filmmakers but the way that they do it really implies that it feels like a dream sequence
there's lots of implications for why it's a dream sequence and so like even i would just be like yeah
i know that's what you guys are saying it is but you really didn't necessarily do a great job
of putting that forward and the people saying it's a dream sequence have more than valid references
for that really interesting thing to talk about though and i would rather just go case by case
for each one how relevant the comments are from the person who made it are usually just going to
be tied to how relevant the references in the actual content are um i've heard the defense
that snokes insults and insulting his mask was him training kylo i just i don't get what the
point of the mask was in the first place then was he just putting it on for the funsies and
snoke never liked it i don't get snoke and kylo's relationship yeah and i don't think snoke has any
room to call someone else that they look stupid he wears fucking gold bathrobe he looks ridiculous
plus his face is fucked up he should wear a fucking mask boom yeah
anyway uh if a guy invites you over to his place and you see a donald glover lando pop figure next
to a pickle rick pop figure should you be concerned uh yeah but don't abort yet keep it in mind but
it don't abort yet yeah let's call it a it's a flag not as it's not a red flag it's a it's just
a little little bit yellow flag no red flags yet it could be cool just misguided this one says er speak
up yeah but funko pop all right that's a no from me that's a no straight up no yeah tell mola to
watch jojo watch jojo after i've done it uh iggy made me sad to chase i the i the fact that i've
owned dogs if his breed only made it worse
hmm because icky was the dog and jojo right oh okay that makes more sense leave ira remember
that from a conversation we had today uh watch jojo that makes sense then yeah we have increased
hit hitler meme production so that er gets happy and talks more that makes sense for the movie
blob and efap.me fund also high regs hello movie bob site please this one says er money um
would you like two dollars er
i mean i want to go miss i can i can list it i've got i've got all of the ones the
specific that people listed i can just fucking uh rags is the apex heterosexual and er looks
like a lesbian yeah well it is a complicated timeline i don't know got the closely cropped
hair the purple yeah i guess so how do you feel can't argue with that just can't argue with it
um don't kick jay longbone she's the good jay yeah i'd agree with that yeah i watched the new
star wars wednesday night and i'm the only one that thought there was something really off about
the way it was edited uh there wasn't anything specifically i was thinking about editing wise
just mainly the pacing busy busy busy go go go there was a couple of long shots that were
nice enough uh like the camera moved a whole bunch but i could mostly follow it it was more
just there was no time to calm down that's what it felt like um but if i watch it again i might be
able to spot some stuff at the editing maybe i don't know it's been several days and multiple
viewings and tros is still in the top three for me i don't know why top three of star wars movies
oh man oh i need to see a doctor man it's well established in non-canon and canon that
ships can't go to light speed inside a planet's gravity well yet poe does it like three times
well the millennium falcom special and reasons and they don't care
inside a gravity well as in within its atmosphere or within the the field of its gravity
close enough i guess too close getting too surely they did that in the ot right
but ray bypassed the compressor oh yeah there you go the secret
someone else had thought about that what would han solo know about being able to do that
nothing terrible nothing stupid old man oh yo where's that gary stu video you teased at
it every video i've teased is never coming to fruition i do that a whole bunch but i do
actually genuinely intend to make these things i just take ages you must know this feel i'm sure of
it um i'm so sick of hearing otherwise respectable youtubers gush over the mandalorian moolern rags
seem to be the only ones who can see it for the shit that it is and maybe robot head it desperately
needs a video takedown i mean i don't plan to make a video um but i'm happy to talk about it in a
podcast at some point yeah well definitely efap it but uh yeah no i've been hearing loads of uh
really good things about it from lots of different people um i am angry joe made some videos about it
and i'm sure they're great question for the long man himself and any other efap guest has
your opinion on something ever been changed on an efap debate or video um
i think i can't remember not because it necessarily hasn't happened it's just because i don't
remember i might not remember it um i guess my perspective was changed on arrival
i felt like i had to reframe everything i was thinking about that film after the whole like
how time works in it it like threw me for a complete loop in that debate
um spider-man ones i wasn't fazed because i just i'd heard the arguments over and over again about
the comics and i just don't i like to separate out adaptation quality um there's the game of
thrones one that was insane uh to say the least the major league didn't have your mind change
no and then there's the major lee one which was i just look back at smirk
the not so great debate that was just funny um what else is there what other debates have been had
uh let's see oh the remarkable republican and shad debate oh that was i can't even remember a
lot of x i was very drunk you were you were clearly very drunk it was wonderful oh it was
so amusing to listen to that i remember um but yeah as for like videos we've covered
yeah i don't know if i was to be really generous i feel like it's like eight percent of the videos
we covered we consider to be like good right maybe maybe ten
well the ones i've seen on here are bakora which have been great right yeah so i'm a little biased
i'm sure there has been things maybe not big things but smaller things like little details
little sections maybe it's hard to think back exactly but uh we do more so want to cover
videos that we can sort of argue the other side of we're not like we've said this before but the
problem is say for example we had we we had a video that was just really well argued and
really well referenced we're concerned that we just play it all which we actually did with um
eric monroe's video i believe but um that was in the interest of sort of trying to promote
the channel and be like hey it's an up-and-coming youtuber um give it a shot we did it with robot
heads video on plj um they're not exactly examples of our mind being changed but something that we
sort of agree with so yeah i'm just trying to think i don't think we've covered something we
go oh my god i never thought of this thing that's totally changed my view on this piece of content
yeah i was wrong the whole time turns out the movie's great i don't think it's been anything
like that it's funny we have er here because the one of the examples i would have is get out i
thought get out was pretty good and then he's also saw his video and i was like fucking hell
get out makes no sense at all yeah and that film was getting praised to high heaven and it's probably
part of why you made that video i'm assuming yeah a little bit i might be a bit of a contrarian
but uh yeah not so much on efap from what i remember like a significant opinion being changed
um 2020 resolution bring back ms paint mauley if i ever make a dissection video i will consider
bringing those back i swear um i'm skydoorwalker i remember that meme to a degree jay long put n
word as your twitter personal pronoun if you should put ewok in there that'll be great ewok
i'm sorry ea but it's a super china says that ea say ma rei su
ma rei su look at that treating you like some kind of sickest clown disgusting isn't it
uh mola gets swole when he spooked oh yeah remember that like meme i just suddenly
gatelets and muscles went like searching for what's happening it's an evolutionary adaptation
um more of the picture above you is a family portrait oh yeah there was uh
i i i remember seeing it in the meme there was like a frame um it was it was a nicely drawn meme
i liked it there's just uh lots of funny little references here i move bob.com and have it linked
to efap.me that is that is an idea is it literally you just you if you pay 500 you can literally buy
it is that how that works i can you could buy it for 2500 but you can put in bids and minimum
bids are 500 oh so i tried to put in five but it wouldn't and and so you know that's uh
like five even if we did let's just say we had 500 to use on it that's still not like a guarantee
or anything right it's a bit of a no not a not a guarantee i mean you wouldn't lose it by making
the bid it would just you know you'd have to pay that much for the thing right uh er i think about
your profile pic that you're a fan of log horizon would you consider doing a review of it and would
you recommend it to someone like molar or rags uh i probably won't do a review but i really do
enjoy it first season's great uh sword or online gets a lot of flack but if you want an actually
good anime about people being trapped in an mmo taking it kind of seriously developing sort of
an economy and a new way of life inside of a game it's pretty cool stuff yes it says uh
um would you recommend it to us because we love will building but don't typically watch anime
i mean i talk about will building a lot but i would say like my favorite element is usually
character before will building uh characters like big tisms i just fucking hate it when people
damage will building hardcore they don't care about it yeah i think log horizon has a good
mixture of both uh i hope you all get to have a happy new year also high rags hey hello barbu
frick did 9 11 all right hey that's an easy beam i think of it uh rip er no no he's still here
hanging in there thank you chase for the only play it was funny yeah it was funny and i liked it
uh it was funny i didn't do that the chats must flow hour six we're on six and the current
life stream is on hour 10 so i think we're actually getting there pretty close now will
we ever see the return of the pikeman yeah i'm absolutely on board having uh boxes cg and snacks
all to guess back um we'll sort it out eventually you know efap is gonna be difficult with getting
people into the right times for the right things but um i'm i'm more than on board to add to the
idea mauler is an eldritch horror think hp lovecraft his criticism is so incomprehensible
to normal critics their minds shatter my god that is pretty impressive um thanks incredible
thanks for keeping me sane throughout a depressing period in life off to boot camp in february gonna
try and get y'all some good rat till then ps high rag oh yeah uh hello and good luck have a good time
the account in the road that is er gubift uh if that's how you pronounce that he he's um
or they have done a couple of pieces of some pretty cool art from what i remember let me check my um
fan art if i know which one yeah he made um he made these two
okay check me fan art oh i know that one yay those are good yeah i know they're freaking
awesome uh i wish those are great let me get them on screen for chat so you know what i'm talking
about um a little bit lower quality because they're the discord versions but um yes the uh
the epic of dawn carrying metal up the mountain even got aid in there as well yeah uh i assume
he meant when he said um all good rats you might be making more of these i don't know but we love
them it's good shit and uh hope you have fun in boot camp i suppose yeah you're a very very
talented artist hope to see some stuff from you again uh only plays on efap maybe this isn't the
worst timeline wondering if the efap movies can be released regardless of the doom movie tisms
also high rags well you can actually watch it right now it's on the efap.me website if you look
i think in the efap episode section scroll down to the minis there's a um a version that
kiva kids managed to sort of download and host separately um but doom as far as i'm away i can
put that out soon now uh so you expect it pretty soon and then once that one's done the rest of
them can roll in and to remind you all we've got doom lord the rings lord the rings lord the rings
godzilla toy story wrinkle in time torchwood i think that's it have i missed any do you remember
rings i think that's it the three load of the rings torchwood wrinkle in time doom godzilla
godzilla story four toy story four i think that's it either way so all of that content is ready to
go and uh obviously um before i think wolf mentioned it on his uh last efap that um he's
in the three lord the rings ones so it's just a good old me rags and wolf riffing on lord of
the rings and i am excited to get the fellowship version out that one was uh it's the it's so good
lots of fun guys it's been teased for like a billion years but it's finally going to be
coming out soon i swear um anyway possible double super chat i don't know but apocalypse
now was a better love story than ralo agreed also high chase twilight love stories and j long bone
kick guests molar and rags oh damn wanna kick us never yeah we are unkickable um cool eu fans be
glad mara jade was never canon they would have had her a black red head with uh like every other
ginger like ariel well this is what i mean about like how people like hey they should do x they
should do y they should do z it's like i don't know no keep them away you don't want to trust
disney with things you like their track record is well they did look terrible look what they did
to han like why do you want them to touch these things uh hi all and rags first super chat um
oh wow wanted to say thanks for all the content and hope you've enjoyed some of the memes i've
made give up the good work i'm sure we have i'm glad you like it seems the good shit and yeah
uh thank you 60 of the time palpatine's plans work all of the time
i mean they never work i guess ultimately ultimately they never work they work temporarily
remember when kevin smith said something like the end of tros will melt your mind watching his one
hour renew now can't imagine how he justifies that oh do we need to see that we can't do a one
hour video on efap can we is not i mean not not on efap i don't think yeah i don't think well
oh we could probably check it out at some point maybe um hey er hope you're well i am thank you
i'm all i wanted to thank you for making my 2019 the first year of heavy movie consumption i've
caught so many classics such as the departed that you pointed out and my god movies are great hi rags
hello and yes movies are great when you watch specific ones there's a lot of tisby ones but
there's a reason why i'm very passionately involved in movie discussion movies are also
when they're awesome uh did you massive show er that we had planned fan art i drew weeks ago i'm
curious what he thinks of it are you talking about stratum ire yeah i thought that was is that let
me i'm pretty sure i've got it saved or was there another the plant one oh i think they may
have been more than one it's gonna be so i have like thousands of memes and um i don't know if
i'll be able to find that one specifically but er er have you seen any memes of you like a plant
getting fed water when you're dying that's so familiar oh i know what they're talking about yeah
well they tweeted oh yeah if you've tweeted it yeah there's a good chance you may have seen it
yeah i've got a folder for diabetes on my computer yay so many diabetes such great art
as well like people making full-on some of them are crazy some people just the news flows through
them when it comes to diabetes uh mauler if you haven't done the super chat video with wolf yet
please tell him hello all my e-words somewhere in that conversation also hyrax hello um i'm sure
we'll have we're gonna have to tell him about the the e-walk stuff for sure if he doesn't know about
it uh because my god quinton what have you done um also man you guys weren't kidding when you said
that the only good episodes of the mandalorian were the first two no we weren't kidding i was
gonna say we never kid we don't joke around that's not what we did we really wanted to love
mandalorian like we're like yay this could be really great and they were like oh i remember
when fringy you and myself when we watched it we were like man not gonna call it too early but
this is really good and i'm i'm i'm ready for it and now well uh thoughts on mandalorian seven
and eight redeemed or no terrible terrible they did the opposite kind of stupid i don't want to
get into it right now but yeah it's stupid uh last efap of the decade or surprise new year's eve
stream also hi chase so i like the idea of doing a new year's stream the only thing is that that's
gonna be like a day from now and like i really want to kick on with my video and i don't know
if i can do another 12 hours of a week out of not editing um but maybe we could do something
short of some kind maybe we could even play something i kind of like maybe doing something
for new year's so i'm not sure yet yeah definitely not a bad idea i shall discuss
ideas with raggers the raggers potential guest is efap anime maul are you seeing ghost in the shell
i have not i love ghost in the shell so much rags has and i think er and chase face have
avatar airbender would be good as well so uh avatars on my list ghost in the shell
wasn't but i don't see any reason why it wouldn't be you know maybe um yeah which is
worse ray core or core ray hmm jolly core would be the worst combo both of them was like oh god
yeah but hmm that's
i don't know core ray could be funny like a hideous creature that's morphed for both of them
yeah like a horrible theme universe fusion
but yeah i mean obviously the answer is core yeah unpopular opinion jojo memes make me wish
i didn't exist my best friend is infuriated that i refuse to watch it you can tell me to kiss
kill myself all day um
like is is that the memes coming from the fan base meaning that you you got put off from
watching it in general i guess maybe not the first i've heard a lot of people get put off
of uh watching or even trying rick and malty because of the fan base unfortunately um more or
less sub two average pixel after you treat out his reload animations video the best video editing i
have seen on youtube cheers for that very underrated youtuber but i mean dare i say not
anymore he fucking exploded with that um uh reload video it was kind of crazy because he was getting
like hideously low views and then that video just kicked off and i think he's doing it right now
yeah 1.5 million for that video which again i watched that with fringy and rags i believe
um very cool video and lots to think about it was um it's a perfect storm it's a subject that
doesn't get talked about a lot he did his research he's got great editing good voice well scripted
imported just good shit um yeah that's that's average pixel satisfying reloads for anybody
who's curious check it out uh b stars watch it it's a good show it's coming to netflix very soon
or you can sail the high seas for it gotcha uh first draft 2000 words in two thirds of the
way into the movie i felt like i left a lot out which i need to add first time doing this maybe
i'll actually release it go for it dude yeah absolutely give it a shot give it a try give it
a see um this movie was member berries and sorry for tlj changed my mind i think it was a lot of
things uh those definitely included definitely got member berries but uh we're also dealing with
some tlj sucks are my right boys in that movie but it also has like crazy uh again i don't get
i didn't even realize that you know like major lee's gonna be really happy about the ralo moment
right because he that's like what he was gunning for do you remember how we were like what like
what is the implication where did that come from but apparently jj thought that something was there
that we didn't see like why would ray and kylo be the robots came out of nowhere for me
i don't get it i don't know what they seen each other i mean i guess she's the most powerful being
in the universe or whatever but and so i'm left to as for what she sees in him like yeah i don't
know and so i assume he's trying to panda to the people who wanted that i guess and then it just
like he pandas to so many different demographics in that film like the white supremacists yeah he
panda to the nazis can you believe it just for that sweet sweet money sweet nazi money not me though
uh theory disney never watched the original trilogy but rather they watched the robot
chicken star wars parody instead and that's how palpatine survived i mean it if it makes sense
you know that's that's what i reckon it's not the most nonsensical thing in that movie
er review title brainstorming episode nine or rise of sky people in parentheses
i'll put them under advisory i'm still i'm still thinking of a name actually i haven't
really settled down on one lots of potentials though
hmm saw uncut gems in a packed theater crowd was more engaged than tros
four for me this year and black dew power nika is one of the year's best lines
oh i don't know if that's from uncut gems i guess did you like it rah if rah liked uncut gems maybe
it's a true nazi masterpiece or not so bad sorry rag is but mando was always pupas dutus
it wasn't the first episode and the second episode were good
assuming you anamu guys are still there what are your thoughts on goblin slayer and tanya the evil
haven't seen him i've only heard of him there now that's like the mandalorian if you want to watch
something good there you go on that wait and tony the evil is so call the slayer is good
yes okay basically autistic guy in a helmet with a very rational hatred for goblins
and he just goes him oh what do you need
and tony the evil is is okay it's all right
uh yeah spongebob gets really bad it became a parody of itself with how hard it's trying to
be itself i remember getting sad when i was younger i could tell when the writers changed
uh rags if your sso wants to poop with the door open yeah what do you do if your sso wants to poop
with the door open hey if he she wants to poop with the door open fine they they can poop with
they can poop with the door open but when i'm pooping that door is closed all right
there you go uh chase the anime pacing is really slow but the manga is fast paced and gets the
point again showing that manga is superior read bazook you and just says n i uh maybe nini i'm
sure he's going for nini nini yes nitpicker you nitpicker that's probably what it was
nitpicker hour seven we are we are at around 10 in real time catching up oh my goodness youtube
is banned in china i'm being a criminal using vpn only for red letter media and efap i risk
being imprisoned for rich evans and high rags oh hello just be careful man yeah be careful and
of course if you're gonna risk anything for anyone rich evans is a good choice but rich evans yeah
there's no hollywood star with whom i'd rather rich risk it
uh thank you yeah um have y'all watched bakemonogatari yet i'm gonna get to the point where
i pronounce that cleanly eventually i'm sure but no no have you oh damn none of us
um use this money to put together a crew of professionals to rescue quinton's lover
hashtag save q doll a team of professional mentally breaking into his house and taking
the magnificent tisms uh game of thrones destroyed end game forgotten star wars raped
only one film stands atop the rest a story about a defeated clown rising up kino
yeah joker did did better than all of them um i think the st is just the fantasized retelling
of the events of the st from ray his scavenger who spent her life without purpose and dreaming
of being a central part in the struggle of the galaxy you're saying she's an unreliable narrator
except she doesn't have a motivation for it
don't forget about efap mini beetleborgs is a tism big bad beetleborgs
what's that reference in big bad beetleborgs what are they it's like old um old uh like all
power rangers sort of things except they're beetles hmm yep uh kim possible was way better
than totally spies it was if buffy fused with james bond and they made it a cartoon
oh there you go everyone should watch kim possible watch kim possible
ever heard of spider raiders if not google it spider raiders spider raiders
it looks like uh anime only one season spider people with spider max or something i don't know
but all right spider raiders it's a wonderful life it's such a perfect pure film everybody
should watch it with family on christmas if you didn't this year make sure you do next year
you all right hey mauler when is the next tfa video coming out sorry just kidding love your
stuff take as much time as you need to create the next great spark of longtism bad fires
well thank you stuff is on the way and uh ps rags hi hey uh hello er hello could a half black
half white kid be called grayscale without it backfiring into a cute accusation of scalyhood
i'm not exactly the one you should go to for that
hey what's the question it's in the game of thrones universe grayscale is about
having a disease scale schism so no it depends on what universe we're talking about
you want that on your penis do you want that on your penis i don't want that on my penis
scale tisms you can argue that it's not a 9 11 out of sorry 9 out of 10 not 9 11 9 out of 10
it was this it was the forward slash i read it as a one that was my bad you can argue that it's
not a 9 out of 10 it is angry jew on man of steel their dceu ranking list is rise of skywalker
level of tism uh how it should have ended said it's not the worst star wars movie and the
celebration of the old films no hey man let people enjoy it 86 audience score what can we say what can
you do angry jew huh that was uh that was a slip of the tongue by rags in uh the jenny jebby
nickels episode language oh angry jew right rags clearly harboring some hatred for mexican
jewish people nice yeah i have no problem with the mexican jewish people all right
mine and negros yeah there you go pronounced it like that so i'm fine akeira do it
yes akeira is a good right yeah do it yeah i always thought of the midichlorians as a way
to explain natural proficiency you might have more or less at birth but that doesn't mean you
can't train to be better yeah pretty much really though i mean like a actual power level
so well with what they were saying earlier about how they're like just an indicator of potential
um so like how you have someone who could be like really good at um certain sports i guess
but they still need to do a whole bunch of other things in order to be best at said sport
than just sure they can do naturally um and then it's like okay but then is that random between
each person the potential or is it like if you're a skywalker you're more proficient naturally or
you've got a little bit more natural talent and i guess that is how it works you've got a bit more
natural bonuses depending on your family's bloodline and proficiency themselves yeah um but i suppose
i would need more flashing out yeah it's it's very very hard to nail it down with just the mainline
movies uh when will you guys be doing a stream with sargon we'll have to reschedule at some
point we can make it up yeah well we did like mention this like we knew this was gonna happen
like riser skywalker was gonna infect conversation for a while but it'll happen we'll get around to
it um i am sure none of you watched college football but that targeting call against ohio
state was objectively dick cancer yeah i got nothing yeah i i don't think i i didn't see that
game i couldn't tell you i couldn't tell you my man does that mean that the best car from
mandalorian is supposed to be the star's equivalent of nazi gold i guess so maybe sort of that stuff
was really good like it's protected him significantly throughout the show that is
yeah he's that is really good like to the point where i don't see how hit it should be an insanely
valuable resource that people are just oh people want to get all over that also to the point where
i'm not sure how he survived before he had that because yeah because he takes a lot of shots
yeah man he's it's it's like he yeah he shouldn't rely on it
yeah steven universe future movie reviews is my wish i loved your review of the first series my
favorite parts for the beginning and middle please brand is grant yeah grand that might be a while
well my friend but maybe also do you like junji ito horror stories er thanks
i'm familiar with them uh but i haven't really read more than two i don't think both are very good
though i just got back from rise of skywalker really like the palpatine bits other than that
the movie was kind of bad i liked it more than the last jedi though it was more entertaining
i agree there it was more entertaining sure i found it more entertaining yeah
um which is the true og jedi don jeb walker or babu frick
question say the question one more time the true og jedi don jeb walker or babu frick
oh i think put my vote in for frick
could you imagine little babu frick with a lightsaber kit i mean is there a reason why
one of his people couldn't be a jedi and use a lightsaber and have the force power nothing
stopping him get that disney plus series going yeah there you go
um yeah i think the don sort of he's a collective umbrella of more things than just the jedi like
it's probably babu frick and then the don sort of oversees all things as naturally uh guys we saw
the end of the skywalker saga infinity saga and game of thrones all this year what the hell do
we talk about next year oh there's always gonna be something good no i didn't um we can talk about
uh i don't know there's always gonna be more things always gonna be always gonna be more stuff
but it is kind of interesting to think like marvel's big partial finale the star wars quote
unquote finale game of thrones finale like hmm only one year um hello all you masses have any of
you seen 28 days later and 28 weeks later opinions on either i have i've seen them both i i really
like 28 days i don't really care for 28 weeks but i will say 28 weeks's opening scene was really
good yeah to be more definitive i would have to watch them again but i just remember liking them
both yeah same uh if er shows a bobby to rags i'll give you both a kiss
a bobby shows a bobby to wrap a what a bobby what's that i don't know
well nothing interested in then well then you don't even know what it is and i guess
do you know what it is i don't know
um it's slang for a british police officer if he off shows you a british police officer
uh bobby um a sling uh it says
uh police officer yeah i i don't know what a bobby is
oh well what if i did show you british police officer
well then what then would i have to kiss you is that what the deal is i think he said he would
kiss you'll give you both a kiss oh that'd be nice um
winton and bob look like old lighthouse keepers i get it i get it they're like that that kind
of works i can see that actually i would even watch that film just to honor them as as creatives
who's more useless knights of ran or the golden company it's always going to be the golden company
even the knights of rented more than the golden company did what the knights of rendu found people
for kylo all right they didn't do much with it but that is already more than the golden
company just stood there and died that's all they did i mean kind of what they did too though
yeah but they did slightly more by finding a person i guess yeah i guess they win by default
i was gonna say i cannot stress if you could the the golden company did
fucking nothing they they shouldn't have existed there was no point
um after work fellas we'll finish watching when i get back also high rags make mauler hello watch
the astartes short videos please thank you i believe we have haven't you uh mauler i definitely
watched some if not a few now because they made efap memes about i think there's only four i think
there's only four um quinton is well shall we say an sjw i hate to use that word but he embodies that
and embraces all of its toxicity he's not good definitely losing his marbles as time goes on
but you know this is my first super chat love you guys and the work you do with efap
miss wolf given my best also high rags hello and we shall and thank you uh eos sex appeal
is overwhelming me i have to get out i'm sorry yeah i can't follow your heart
it's hard to resist uh everything chase says is wrong and kojima is still a hack rags is shit too
fuck off okay rags and chase get him beat the fuck out hmm i love my hero but i agree with chaser
on the fan cringe my main reason is because it's a superhero type comic that does its job of being
a comic slash manga uh oh my hero academia i guess because i love my hero i guess uh also don't mean
don't you mean watch through it chaser hey oh i i'm sure chase would appreciate
hey er thoughts on minecompe
uh a little heavy but you know you got nothing else to do some summer reading
there's a there's a video going around now of a of a boy who asks his grandfather for minecraft
for christmas and when they're all open in presence as a family he opens it up and it's
mine camp because his grandfather thought he said mine camp and so he's got him for his birth
or for christmas wow that's amazing oh he's just a little kid that's hilarious i want to see the
oh heavy reading for the boy but all right what if the parents were like why did you ask for this
he's like oh it's not the video i asked for minecraft he probably didn't even know what mine camp is
yeah uh do you think dust bullshit gets ashy i i don't know how to respond to that
gets ashy i don't know pretty sure ashy skins caused by lack of moisture so you got lotion for
that uh hello mauler wags and esteem guests hello hello master rags a few efaps ago you said
every grown man should own a sword i feel the same way about firearms so naturally i now own
a cutlass from cold steel now as a result ten out of ten would impulse buy again
um let me see cutlass the 1917 all i know is cutlass cold steel that's all i got
cold steel mimic a 1917 cut and it looks pretty sweet um yeah i got a my sword arrived last week
and i'm very very pleased with it so far i really think it's awesome um in fact i actually ordered
a rifle uh yesterday in it and it's on its way so i'm i'm arming up i i i got it in my feeling
that there might be a boogaloo soon so i gotta you know i gotta get ready only weekend warriors
in the chat i guess he woke up how is he did he wake up yeah we're still going because that's what we
do um a guy by the name of mad black atheist said only losers stream for four hours losers he says
yet you're more popular than him so who's the loser here yeah we don't stream for four hours
we stream for 12 hours so we're clearly winners yeah he wouldn't think we're losers he said if
you stream for four hours you lose obviously he's trying to say you should be streaming for more
than four hours yeah of course we yeah so yeah we agree with him good stuff guy um what about game
of thrones all four seasons were amazing oh i get it i get it irags what do you massive think of
edf xcom and the new gears games um so i played the most recent edf that came out and it was
really goofy but kind of charming in the same way i don't even know what to compare edf to it's just
a super campy sort of shooter game um it definitely worth the look but man it is out there that's
earth defense force right yes earth defense force um i didn't play the second one he mentioned um
years what was it oh no wait xcom i haven't played xcom but i did play gears five and it
was pretty good um i really liked the campaign it was fun i played it once through solo and then
once at a harder difficulty with a friend and we had a good time playing it it's expensive though
but if you get the xbox game pass which is like really a really great deal then you could get it
for like a dollar five bucks and you could play it through i didn't care for the multiplayer really
at all but i thought the campaign was uh long enough to go through and it was enjoyable and
i think it's worthy of a look it's gorgeous too really gorgeous the cutscenes look great
um some of the best cutscenes i've ever seen
um also rags what do you think of monster hunter world and or monster hunter
i i can't remember what that stands for i have not played monster hunter i have i really like monster
hunter world i think it was a really awesome game and that uh it's a bit heavy for a pc to
run but if you can run it uh it's pretty much everything that i wanted from a pc version of
monster hunter because i played it on psp for like ages this is monster hunter world yes because i
know i got people who play that sort of thing so uh chase face come on efap more and be the
weeb to help out even this sausage fest here's your sugar money uwu yeah have any of you guys
watched black sheep 2006 if not i couldn't recommend it more it's basically the room
without all the boring parts oh it's like a it's like a funny movie um but yeah no i'm not here to
it uh do chris stuckman's riser skywalker review i mean we could give it a tester i i doubt he's
a tester and it would be done yeah that's the other problem with him his videos are super short
and he barely says anything uh we could do it we could line up a couple short ones maybe maybe
every once in a while we do some short save some short videos for like a marathon where we try to
pound through them pretty quick i could agree with the idea that ryan wasn't as bad since he
was trying something different if he hadn't done it in the second movie of a trilogy
this is an interesting like difference you know it's like how much how much uh do we judge them
for not only their intentions but also the execution you know it's complicated you really
fucked up but so did jj this is why i don't want to take that away uh disagree with ds as just bad
but i love chase's opinion i think uh ds which anime is that death stranding oh that's an
anime as far as i could say that's fine kind of they are kind of anime ish in ways um this super
chat says does er talk occasionally yeah he said occasionally uh what do you guys
think of the clone wars cartoon made by samurai jack creator
which one is that the 2d uh yeah the little short ones i haven't seen them
it's been so long since i have seen them i couldn't i remember liking him as a kid
yeah same maybe those are they're probably on youtube or something somewhere maybe we should
maybe we should go through and watch them because they're kind of kind of short they're like a
bunch of little b chapters yeah maybe um you cannot abort that which has been born
you could still you could still kill murder them though yeah you could you could abort them
you don't know about it these days oh i just i'm referring to just the sequel trilogy abort them
even though they're all dubbed out just kill them and they sleep it's fine luke skywool's birth
abortion yes uh what was your takes on rlm's review i enjoyed it and still agree with their
sentiments on as bad as the sequel trilogy is pt is still worse rich evans says so disagree i disagree
with that i think that the prequels are way better than the sequel trilogy i think they're
wrong and a few other things a lot of details if i was in the room i would have mostly agreed with
their stuff but i would have definitely disagreed with some of the things that they said i was i
was just playing minecraft as one does listening to the review and i was like i don't know if i'd
say that i don't think i'd go that i don't agree i mean their overall sentiment sure but a lot of
the details and things they said i just didn't i got a really strong impression that they were
about the whole thing like they just didn't really even want to necessarily talk about it that much
kind of yeah even though it's a little bit longer pretty apathetic
but yeah like and and just seemed kind of like not in a bad way in terms of like entertainment
because i still enjoyed the video but like a little bit all over the place in terms of like
what do we even talk about it's like how dumb this plot point is how this behind the scenes thing
probably happened how jj's friends these people and these people did these things how this trilogy
is acting you know i mean like it felt like we were jumping between all kinds of different
subjects which is fine i was interested to listen to them it's just that um
i don't know that they yeah out of their minds yes um and i just i don't know i think it's really
hard especially revenge of the sith revenge of the sith's better than the sequels by far
i think oh yeah absolutely yeah uh also rich evan's laugh can cure cancer probably
oh i think that's probably can it's probably just true now yeah
make baby yoda wreck on the disney sequels does baby yoda have that kind of power i don't know
um i wanted to thank you guys listening to your work has increased my writing a hundred fold
you're doing god's work good stuff thank you uh half of this is for efab.me half for the movie bob
dot com you massive love y'all thank you very much um for the efab.me cause balanced as it should be
very well uh er what are your thoughts on daisy ridley taking two hours to close
her mouth in the rise of skywalker or are we gonna have to wait for your official review
i will say that i found it a twist on convention
uh rotten tomatoes changed from verified to all audience
um i'm assuming let me just check this out of curiosity you have to like that's what they did
right like they said it used to just be everybody but now it's like you have to be a verified
audience member as well it would anyone know what's required for that is it just like an email
confirmation or something i think you have to you have to make an account i guess and i don't know
what else goes into it verified ratings how do you get rid of like i don't care if they're
verified or not all audience there we go how does that look uh well yeah i mean it's the the curated
old verified ones are still 86 i still find that music it's like sure it's 86 fine um good night all
my ewoks see this chat in the morning good night moviebob.com is listed at 2500 usd get your super
chats in your masses we need this also i mauler and er i guess i mean you might say hi so hi
and it just says rags you're okay yeah you bet man that's probably the nicest thing that
anyone's ever said to me really you are okay uh do you guys think that shows in which people
travel in some form of a vehicle ship car plane spaceship with the vehicle being plot armor
incarnate are we able to tell good stories say that one more time oh do you guys think that
shows in which people travel in some form of vehicle be it a ship a car a plane or a spaceship
with the vehicle being plot armor incarnate are we able to tell good stories
what do you mean the vehicle being plot armor incarnate yeah that's a strange question because
um i mean if we just take mandalorian for example this is an episode that begins with his ship
getting blown apart and he has to land um our plane ship yeah like all of them i wouldn't
go as far as saying plot armor and i'm curious i mean they can i mean but you you also have
things like mad max and stuff where cars get blowed up and things of that nature um i mean
as cars cars getting beat up all the time is a great way to show progression of damage
well there's all of your head what's the property you can think of with like the main vehicle that's
run makes them immune to the only thing i can think of is maybe the tardis but even that gets
fucked up in falcon but that gets damaged all the time right yeah it's like they it takes an
insane amount of damage then gets repaired in the sequel trip like in the rise of skywalker
that thing's like on fire it's getting beat to shit you can even look at how it was and and look
at how it was in the solo movie that thing got fucked up and lando just flies it away true um
but see i wouldn't even blame the vehicle at that point i would just call it it's just plot armor in
general like it's just poor writing yeah that's the show runners or the the makers of the show
being like oh yeah right um it can be but i again the alternative is a vehicle can get damaged and
the windows can get busted wheels can get blown off uh they can get dense bruises bullet holes
things like that and that's not actual damage to like a character but it shows that they're taking
fire they're being attacked there there's the risk of damage that's there and that's a way
to show progression over you know a period of time like they start a journey with the vehicle
or a car and by the end of the journey it's like a top gear episode that car's beat to shit and
it's busted and dirty uh correction on an alien chat i can't spell sorry i said iggy's death made
me sad too it's made worse because i own dogs that were the same breed as him sorry i was typing fast
from and uh yeah that uh i think that was on the conversation about like what
didn't get to you on an emotional level whether or not it's like well written and stuff
uh pets pets totally do it for loads of people uh hey efap crew i'm writing a story out for a
fighting game i will eventually start on i wanted to ask if i could use the efap crew as characters
go for it yeah absolutely that could be interesting hmm when will you guys do a video praising the
consistency of the latest mission impossible movie fallout didn't we do that yeah we had a whole
we had a whole episode about fallout and there was a debate for fallout afterwards we love that
movie that movie was like is like shockingly good oh yeah those are back-to-back efaps i believe
yeah man we had that was southpaw debating ren's reviews with us sort of hanging out
and jumping in and uh yeah we had a lot of good things to say about fallout
that was the episode where we literally showed him something happening and he's this doesn't
happen showed him the scene of it happening and he's both gonna accept it honestly that'll
probably just be my go-to whenever someone wants someone to explain what movie in the
gold post is like is that that's it right there that's it uh the literal dark oh i just missed
that scene for whatever reason i just missed it i guess i just left the room or i had to pee or
or blinked like if i said that car came out of nowhere and then you go what do you mean it was
it was it came on that street and then i go oh sorry what i mean is that it came in really fast
not that i didn't see it it was just really fucking fast like a clarification but it wasn't
that it was like sticking to a point until definitively proven wrong and that new point
comes out of nowhere and you're like wait i thought it was okay let's deal with this one then
um but yes interesting nonetheless
the literal dark comedian mr metica mr metica er i get it weeb as well
um super weave ultra weave hey er any cons you're hitting up this year
no you typically go to any cons i just watched the stuff hanging around weaves just you study them
i guess a little bit i got up close to that chase guy true did you get notes
yeah a few
um i would never treat er as a clown big fan of him would never disrespect
also what manger and anime do you recommend my good man you the best guest
what that's well anime steins gate let's do that one and for manga
let's see try lucifer and the biscuit hammer there you go
rax for a million who would you suck off quinton or diabeto
wait so the question assumes that you're okay with it first of all because you would not well
if if i can opt out i would but if i was forced at gunpoint to one or the other one of these two
um maybe right probably be sugar yeah um i'm not big into sweets that's the thing you
oh you pull bad like how do you deal with this man i don't i don't know if it would be worse
if they had a really big cock or a really small one um i'm gonna go with quinton
but that's hmm yeah i feel it just because diabeto is so terrible
like awful but i guess that's who i would okay yeah it's really tough to stress how awful
diabeto is so i i guess i'd go with quinton yeah if i absolutely had to also see if you guys can
bring it's a gundam as a guest to the show i'm not against that idea yeah maybe you bet uh the
er meme was in the discord i don't have twitter uh again i don't know if he has seen it or not
because there's more than one example of er being awakened by um stuff being poured onto him
as a plant uh i've only seen one oh well you probably saw the stratumire one then
i would imagine i don't know for sure though maybe yeah uh just if you can send it on twitter
or hopefully if you resend it in um maybe send it on the on the subreddit just so that i can
try and find them it's hard to find specific ones um but yeah it would be i mean if you want
eos see it make a twitter an atom with it you probably you'll probably see it then when you
nope just watch polar good thing i've got efap to cleanse the palette
polar bad what's polar let me take a look
there's two movies called polar in 2019 it's a mads michaelson movie yeah i'll guess it's
that one a retirement world's top assassin duncan visla aka the black kaiser is settling into
retirement when his former employer marks him as a liability to the firm against his will he finds
himself back in the game going head to head with an army of younger faster ruthless killers who
will stop at nothing to have him silenced initial release january 20 january 25th 2019
parentheses nigeria all right um it's got a 20 on the critic score and a 65 on the audience
and it's a netflix film so we could go we could watch polar together wonderful
uh just watched oh wait yeah uh what does er think of my hero academia
yeah i'm there for the fights which are pretty good
sad i'm so late but thank you guys for all the lovely faps also high rags hello have you guys
looked at star wars lore youtubers or you star wars law youtuber in general uh no i don't typically
i'm assuming you're referring to like people who go over like much more extensive and deeper stuff
i don't typically um er excited sand people noises oh my goodness also high raggle poo
hello hi hi uh this one just said hey rags hey loved your fallout 76 review have you kept up
with the recent hacking bullshit such as stealing players entire inventory anyway merry christmas
yeah i've heard about that i i have indeed heard of that um yeah there's there's hacks people have
now where they could basically just take all the stuff from your inventory at a distance and this
includes like microtransaction stuff that you bought if you're fucking retarded enough to buy
microtransactions and pay beth as the money in fallout 76 then um people can just take that
from you so that's cool uh rags you ready for civil war 2 virginia boogaloo also hi hi yeah i'm ready
molly your videos were the first i watched ensuring i wasn't insane for not liking tlj
looking forward to your ros videos may the force be with you it's on the way and i'm already very
happy with um i've shown the intro i made like a an edit and uh i've shown a few friends already
and they laughed at it so i was happy that it should work out i'm excited to get that video
out but it's still going to take some time um with riser skywalker underperforming do you think
canady will be stripped of power but allowed to sort of float around until their contract is up
honestly no idea i have no idea you would think that that's what should be done but fuck man who
knows what their plan is i know if it was me she would have been gone a long time
is rose was a part of the rebel alliance she would have zapped harm and thrown him in a cell
on hearth where he when he tells them that he has to leave she wouldn't have been very useful ever
in the uh the ot i think she would have gotten a lot of people killed he's a bit of a i'm thinking
so you have a strange one um peanut butter mayonnaise and banana sandwich yes or no
no i'm gonna vote no myself rags what you reckon say that one more time peanut butter mayonnaise
and banana sandwich yes or no no there you go man it takes it over the line i want to see an
rlm versus efap debate on which star wars trilogy is the worst you guys will put up a decent case
but then rich evans would laugh and win rip i don't even see how it's a competition keep
them distracted yeah i mean it's basically which one's worse but i think that we'd be able to i
mean the sheer destruction that the sequel trilogy does to the ot to the state of the universe is
just it's really like holy shit did the sequels rip and tear through all of the ot's like
significant elements they're just all damaged at this point all three of those sequel trilogy
movies did huge blows and she's like damn while the prequels on the other hand um feel happily
separated for the most part they're connected via anakin becoming vader and a few tisms with the
force but you compare and you're like downright reserved the prequels are downright reserved
once i get around to finding artists and animators i will try and get in contact with you all in
time if possible that is also it will be done in a way of guilty gear xrd art style
all right
rah join maulers discord also hi er
and that's caught up on the super chats for this stream now over to um the stream labs ones and
we've only got an hour left basically we're just gonna try and do as much overflow as we can
um all right love your work mauler thank you um ari quinton butt mad about no rose fin romance
the chinese do not like seeing interracial relationships between one of their own and
a black person regardless of which sex that is having a serious romance would probably get it
banned in china would it actually get straight up banned or would it just not be popular
i mean if if the government decides it's not up to party values then it will be banned they
banned much less um by that shit mauler please tell er that he talks way too much hardly anyone
could get a word in while he was going on and on and on for the first hour of the stream i was
actually starting to get tired of his voice yeah man chill the fuck out water your jabs calm down
what are your jabs um happy christmas you massive f n words mauler you were visited by the
mari loyd this year but the creepy horse skeleton thing your welsh folk tale uh did you win the
rap battle to keep your beer i need a new video opinion on kotor oh wait so
rap battle to keep my beer anyone recognize that the what the mari loyd no the rap battle oh i
guess that is with the the horse okay yes in that case yes um i need a new video opinion on kotor
versus binding of isaac versus system shock versus neo automata you know that would be quite
a long video comparing all four of them um that's a lot of stuff to cover there are some wildly
different games right there um no i love a challenge uh love the show you guys inspire
me to write about media and after half a year of procrastination i'm going to continue writing
about shadow Chernobyl good stuff uh still on efap 51 so i can't wait to hear from you later
uh dude where's critique part i think it's all three the editing on the first two parts
of my favorite work you've done uh anyways thanks for staying objective and not letting
anyone influence you to say something irrational keep up the good shit my friend yeah the the
editing on those is what takes them so fucking long to make but uh i'm like really happy with
them when they're finally done i'm like yes they're fine forever in terms of like i didn't
like uh cut any corners on a particular visual that sort of thing i'm like finally but
obviously they take a while critique part three being uh august 2020 that is the
you date rags locked me in there's nothing i can do sorry blame him that's the that's
where you got sometimes you got to do what you got to do um
did you know that the star destroyers and palpatine's fleet aren't old imperial sds he
hid away despite using sensors from the oldest version they're 800 meters longer despite looking
identical other than the gun i bet jj went back in and demanded bigger they're 800 meters longer
why are they 800 meters longer well someone put up apparently that he uh it's um they're
they're stocked by 3000 people each that's crazy i know and they're just sitting on the ship
just being like all right where are we going like nowhere are we because we don't know which way is up
we don't know which way is up oh oh all right we'll be over here if you need us
all right yeah just you can't look if i you know i don't think you could ever get uh jj to
do a star wars film ever again now and i think it's because like he'd be like how do i go bigger
than that and you're like maybe that was never supposed to be what you were supposed to do
how about that maybe you don't have maybe you don't have to be bigger maybe the problem is that
there's no intimacy in it there's no closeness there's no connection your stakes are just in
fucking bizarro world they're incomprehensibly large they're a scale that people just can't
connect with that's the problem and and it's funny because marvel went with half of the universe has
been erased and yet they still felt smaller because jj just went so crazy with what we
understand because it affected a bunch of people that we cared about
but like what you have crisis on infinite earths and is like literally infinite worlds infinite
realities will be destroyed and you're like how do you get bigger than that you can't
and it already in it feels so stupid and tacky
i've spoken you have spoken which you know i guess you you're carrying on his catch phrase
because of what ended up happening to him wasn't so fun huh but you want to offer some respect
only he was like the only legitimate character i was like hey
you're 50 i like you you're kind of reasonable so now like like i said we got an hour left uh
i have thus the streamlined ones caught up to the ones that haven't been noted by me um kind of hard
to translate why this makes sense but the rest of the ones we've got to catch up on are all in a big
notepad and basically my plan is to just start reading them we won't be able to get through them
but this is me and rags overflow um let's do it yeah okay leave no super chat unread outside of
this one that just came in saying er what are your thoughts on overlord i love it and bought the books
i've seen the first season it was all right uh i wasn't really too big into it i was burnt out
on all the mmo stuff the time when i saw it so i don't really know maybe it's a lot better than
i actually found it at the time um so these are gonna be weird be super jazzed because these are
from uh a few episodes ago but they're all saved so here goes about to watch episode nine no spoilers
please no i think that was the beginning of our stream for episode nine or first few hours um
a thousand generations came in you now yep a bit awkward but hey whatever you're gonna do to win uh
uh brothers i have returned now how about that ray rise of skyle waker huh you guys know that
there'll be a 10th movie right i don't see why they wouldn't make a chapter 10 eventually yeah
i just yeah okay now can you imagine the trailer like i'll be like what in the fucking will do
they make this about like i'm gonna be honest if i i think if you have any sort of any thoughts
or misgivings about the fact that disney isn't gonna sell this off i mean look disney bought
this for four billion they keep in it even if they're not going to do anything with it they
are keeping it especially for as long as it they can profit like if ever if they had like
two films in a row that flopped then they might just sit on it yeah they won't sell it they'll
just sit on it oh apparently they'll have it forever guy 30 000 people apparently in star
destroyers not 3000 jesus how do you feed that many people like you need food you need water you
need supplies power stop it it's just you can't have it this way stop ridiculous
um to the previous super chat thank you for fueling the tros
porno that probably will happen eventually um hashtag be better than the actual thing oh yeah
hashtag palpatine did kill himself yeah he did uh whoops well i really have to say about that
so smart are you sith lord force lightning is like pringles once you pop your card stop yep
my friend is using bad video essays to prove to me that star wars is still good right now i'm just
laughing at it it's so bad behind star wars video um we had that one from narrow right
like i said that one more than any other the top two ones that i remember significantly being
portrayed to me is the ones that will like either change your mind or be one of the best arguments
you've seen with a major lee video and the narrow one both of them were shit they were terrible and
don't ask me the question of what is the best tlj video you guys have covered it's like i don't know
we've covered loads of them i can't remember any of the good ones was the was there a good one
i mean we're not talking we're not talking good at this point we're talking least bad pretty much
my friend is using bad video oh wait sorry first order star destroyers have a secondary bridge
hidden within the hull of the ship in case their first one blows up of course they do no like i
mean like of course they would because the bridge the primary bridge is like exposed up there like
of course there would be a backup bridge um i guess yeah because the the raddest does too right
because there's two bridges in tlj one that gets blown up and then the other one that they still
use yeah it makes sense to me absolutely there would be absolutely there would be a backup bridge
you'd be a fool to not have one i want to talk to you er something about the weeb avengers with
monkey mr metica an upper band on your side as you lead the way the weeb avengers what are we avenging
um i guess shitty bad movies fucking up ip's could that be it good enough for the death note
adaptation what's the what's the weeb part what do you mean are they all weaves they're just
people who like weebie content i guess i don't know all right i guess uh er have you seen
cosmonaut variety hours watchman video i saw like the first two minutes of it that was enough
that's all i needed to see uh will you make more videos on the show
no i cannot sit through that i just can't i'm sorry
uh they didn't have two purple crystals for mace windu yeah if they had he would have survived boy
would have blown up palpatine anyway uh if only mace windu was as strong as ray yeah it was his
big failure was not being as good as he probably trained like an idiot the dead speak when the
beginning of your crawl sounds like the title of a movie being riffed from an episode of mystery
science theater uh you may have issues it's really weird to call most people off guard the
whole the dead speak thing everyone's just like what why i don't necessarily have a problem with
it except for the fact that it's strange i think that's that's all the argument would be it's just
it feels off it it that's think it is strange it's the way we talk isn't quite like i could see
that being like an alternative form of colloquial english that we speak that could be a little
colloquial english that we speak that could be a dramatic you know really quick sort of
catch your attention kind of thing but we just don't talk like that it's weird that they would
have that uh if jj's dilemma was that he needed a bigger villain to facilitate kylo's redemption
then why didn't he just bring back snoke instead of palpatine yeah that's another thing kylo i've
heard this talked about and i haven't even got this in my video i might do it in like a bigger
breakdown but if kylo is a fanboy of vader for reasons of him being a dark side user who is
full on and all this stuff and then he finally meets up with darth vader's boss shouldn't he
be like holy shit you know we're not worthy you're amazing you're palpatine i love you
instead he like immediately wants to kill him except he's standoffish in an asshole yeah and you're
like okay and then there's the whole like yeah you could have actually built something up between
snoke and kylo instead you make snoke and palpatine palpatine and kylo which i don't like
i had barely anything to work with the snoke and kylo but i have even less to work with the palpatine
and kylo it just seems like a you know what i mean like there's nothing there it's just like
yeah palpatine's like this powerful dude i guess and then yeah it's yeah i don't know waste waste
these people don't know each other i throw out the entire trilogy nobody knows each other so
the stakes are just like like oh no how will this person react to this person yeah man it's
just like whatever also there is a scene from the d23 trailer of the ships arriving which looks an
awful lot like a pre-render of the actual scene that was in the movie it's very possible very
possible uh why didn't ray bury the dice too awkward moment i don't think ray gave consent
to all those jedi who came in here i guess she did telepathically they just didn't show that bit
and uh bury the dice i guess she didn't even know about the dice right like there'd be no reason
i don't know why she'd have anything we didn't even see the dice and well luke pulled them off
the falcon then he teleported them as a ghost thing but not really to layer so i guess they're
still you're either on arc two or on kylo take them well he picked them up and then they just
because it creates another continuity sort of question where you're like apparently transmitting
physical objects at great distances using the force is possible now so why didn't he just
give her the dice like physically uh maybe they're trying to say that you can't actually teleport
anything and that they always fade eventually oh sure it's just revealed at this point you're
just like whatever nobody fucking knows uh just don't remember yeah or don't forget guys that
ray using the force teleports a lightsaber to kylo
yeah wasn't that wonderful to avenge anime and manga from the west
all weaves oh yeah no the answers for you um it was aggravating how there was a whole goose chase
for the wayfinder and it turns out the wheelie droid had it the whole time all the plans and info
yeah the only thing the wheelie droid does not have is the ability to circumnavigate the uh
the space cancer that's all the droid didn't have and apparently you need the wayfinder
specifically in order to do that we've already gone over how stupid it is you can't just go around
the space cancer but um on top of it it's like yes we will transmit the wayfinders
tisms i guess to the entire like thousands of ships fleet that all come in at the same time
it's like you guys couldn't possibly have gotten through the space cancer that's just not not a
thing not a thing and i don't know like it just it's all bullshit and they are left at one point
in the movie when when poe and fin come back after ray's ditched them with nothing like they've
wasted all their time and then they just discover that dio has all this information on x ago oh
wow that's good oh very lucky oh good thing for that
um i just got back from uh watching ros of my family my brother is unironically the person
that doesn't like this movie because it ruined tlj there's gonna be a lot of those people
oh we're expecting many essays about that
indulgences man the new canon comics established that the the emperor is darth vader's father
so the skywalkers are palpatines um hmm this rabbit hole's getting too deep
rise of skywalker is whisked but i enjoyed rise of skywalker more than tlj fair enough
also is c3po in an abusive relationship with the others
apparently because they kind of make him a joke the second they kill him
or they they quote unquote kill him it's uh weird the whole thing is weird tlj is the reason this
movie is the way it is i don't feel it's perfect but after thinking of everything this movie was
the best case scenario i don't agree this the best case scenario i feel like jj didn't have
to do a lot of the tismy stuff that he did first of all bring it back palpatine it's not
like riot forced anyone to do that and you might be like well who is he gonna use as an enemy it's
like um i would have made snoke's death a fake out before bringing in palpatine i would have
had snoke be like did you really think you killed me like you know and he it was a hologram the whole
time like oh my god uh floating meditation surrounded by rocks pulling the x-wing out of
the ocean to go save the day those were scenes i wanted from luke and tlj
you haven't raised better than him why would you know they're here moments
alec guinness said it best who's the more foolish the fool or the fool that follows him
jj had the tlj fallout to learn from and he didn't
i don't know what you mean audiences are 86 percent they liked it clearly yeah that's great
okay fuck the force is really balanced now i mean is palpatine dead i'm just an episode
ted trailer where they have palpatine cackling and you're like oh my god no one's ever really gone
nobody's ever really gone
on i put my vote towards tlj being worse c3po and chewy were fun in the film and even though
the writing is probably worse than tlj it made me smile oh riser skywalker ruined the end of return
of the jedi agreed it did yeah all three of them do effort yeah they all like take a stab at ruining
it like how many different ways can we ruin it it's like there's a few more ways left to try
don't worry we could do it uh how did kylo get to exegol in the end imperial class
tie fighters don't have hyperdrive which is why in episode four the gang questions how one was in
alone um the tie fighters just have them in this movie if you remember the beginning they they
hyperdrive after uh bow tie fighters do not have hyperdrive the original
i don't have hyperdrive and life's nor shields but they do now
or at least they have hybrid they also managed to fit one of those enormous
trackers from the space is star destroyers onto their ships that must be awkward yeah
weigh them down a bit i mean along with the hyperdrive don't ask me where they fit it
uh eard do you think daca being a replicant is a rat con that isn't supported by the text of the
film and if so why i do think that it was that originally really scott was being
vague about it i do think that he thought there was a an if there i don't know why he um back on that
i thought you all went down man we well that one's an even more murky area because it depends
on which version of the film you're talking about yeah true because so as much as authorial intent
is a thing um literal differences between blade runners define like the differences on whether
or not he's uh a replicant pretty much like because of the eye thing right yeah true and the uh the
unicorn um yeah lots of interesting things with that uh tfa is the worst one if you actively
anticipated star wars after that film uh you got what you deserved that's an that's an angle tfa
is the first strike meaning that the other two are just sort of the fallout from the initial blast
yeah i think that's there's a fair argument that this is the thing all three of them
i just i don't know like i think that the force awakens is the most coherent out of the three
and that is that is saying something right there because i think it's garbage
like the space chase in tlj is so beyond nonsensical and then the plot of rise of
skywalker do i even need to begin talking about that like holy fuck um it also hurts to say this
but i hate last jedi slightly less rise of skywalker was dumber i like that these super
chats are kind of relevant to what we were talking about so this is useful yeah there you go rise of
skywalker greater than tlj greater than tfa the worst for not reuniting the ot cast um yeah the
tfa definitely fucked up there's no denying it uh also hi mauler rags and guests hello
rise of skywalker worst because of the visuals editing and cinematography
i mean honestly like as much as i could have issues with those things
i wouldn't even start talking about them before hours and hours about the writing
which one is the worst out of the three for cinematography do you reckon folks
uh the force awakens i don't know it's been a while since i've seen it and this is operating
entirely off memory it's i kind of find out how to pick because i kind of like getting all three of
them oh yeah none of it's bad um i don't know mate uh while tlj ruined space fights and force
ghosts tros rendered the ot pointless we'll see they've all done damage to space battles the force
lightsabers jedi sith they all do different pieces and all do more or less based on different ones
but um i'd say they all collectively render the ot pointless with tros just sealing it completely
with palpatine coming back um screenshot pie chart and send to jj and rj tell them their
films are equally trash and tell them thanks for ruining star wars
oh you know what was the hashtag thank you ryan johnson as far as he's concerned he saved star
wars maybe let's fucking match it with backwards latch uh tlj is worse because you didn't expect
what was coming but on tros you didn't give a shit anymore so tlj is worse also hello all and also
high rags hello hello um but the fact that tlj got you prepared for the rise of skywalker
i don't know i mean you gotta give it a hand it tried to destroy it it tried didn't quite succeed
i got bits and bobs done yeah quite a whole bunch this is the thing it's uh it's really
not necessarily important as to which is the worst i guess because they're all just so bad
but uh just splitting that hair is actually kind of just an interesting conversation like
how to how to really figure it out um the vote slash the force is balanced now please someone
animate the debate between us in the chat while molar and them are perplexed i don't even remember
what that debate was about i'm fat so i'm allowed to vote thrice all right hey you got it by the way
did y'all see chris stuckman's take on tros me and rags can check that out maybe i haven't seen it
yeah we could do that i would like to see what he has to say he's very interesting and he always
has such interesting takes hmm hey er do you like one piece
oh no i'm not coming off as a very good league tonight
it's a it's tough you don't know weeb is expected to have seen everything
i suppose or like everything i mean you're probably you're probably someone the
would you describe yourself someone who dislikes more anime than the general amount of people tend
to dislike hmm you pick probably probably uh high rags molar and g clunies big break
snake milk g clunies big break all right yes hello what is g clunies big break
george clunies big break would have been ea yeah the the show he was on ea emergency room
welcome bro yeah oh goodness uh rise of skywalker would have been better if she had screamed i'm a
woman oh i like the like the batwoman i miss batwoman she's coming back she's gonna save us
i don't know i just i kind of miss every week knowing that she knew we had to take a break to
watch star wars she was like okay guys i'm gonna let you do that and we're like oh thanks
who's more powerful ray or batwoman see it should be ray but the plot would do everything possible
in terms of luck technology breaking or characters getting in the way to save batwoman ray would
actually find it frustrating she'd be trying to kill her and like things just keep going wrong
for no reason might say that wouldn't work something would happen but we're gonna work both
ways that's true the plot does really look after ray as well depends which universe they're in
this universe is trying harder for them one of the yeah they're confident universes yeah yeah
and this there's like a mortal combat map where it's split in half and every time they go to either
half one of them starts losing and is pushed back um how about another joke uh pig punch a
is in punch j punch j no we kick j um i saw the movie for free and i want my money back
yep same the worst part of this movie is not how bad it was but that the
that this is the end of the skywalker saga and it completely sabotaged the ot to push an agenda
um the agenda of i guess referring to like ray being the hero now
if that's the claim i would just i'd rather focus on just how fucking awful of a character she is
um but it definitely sabotaged the ot
um i've got a bunch of free money from taking surveys from google i don't buy any apps and
i can't cash it out myself so enjoy as a side note wolf will be missed many f's in the chat
oh yeah uh yeah mary chrism's you lads thank you very much mary krimus
mary krimus hux probably became the mole very recently probably soon after tlj i would say
poe because his character is now he's always angry did we get we didn't talk much about poe
because poe's barely in the film but i don't necessarily this is the thing i thought it was
weird for fin to say that fin was like oh he's always so angry it's like no he's not at least
not from what we've seen poe is actually pretty laid back a lot of the time um fun he's probably
sick of doing everything right no he's getting chat on yeah and then being like he's so angry
and then like he's angry at ray fucking up and stuff i'd be like no no he was he was pissed uh
in tlj at holdo it felt entirely within character that he would be pissed at her for not telling
anybody the plan you know i'd be upset i'd be like lives are at stake woman you're getting
people killed out here for no reason yeah and at the same time he's willing to you know be nice
to people have some fun every once in a while like i i think the poe was really wasted as well
i mean he's not like as wasted as fin levels wasted but man poe could have been a really cool
swashbuckling hero type but oh we can't have those he could have been like a like a different kind
of han solo you know just like a more martial version of han almost like a like a secret agent
who doesn't always like like a cop who doesn't always follow the rules but get stuff done
you know like turn on your badge damnering that sort of thing he's saying he gets stuff done so
they let him his badge you know i'm saying like everything else no he's wasn't wasn't uh er to
pig puncher how about another joke pigay pigay pigay he did his own little efap on me as i recall
oh the the guy who said every frame in nazi yeah yeah i think you're nazi oh yeah hooray
um ray would win she has force ghosts also high regs hello it is true she would have quite a bit
of power on his side it's undeniable yeah i think of all the women ghosts who she would
but you know we do have the tism guns in the batwoman universe i wonder what that could do to ray
shutter to thing um
how long until theaters charge people for no ads
man i don't know about you guys but when i went to go see the rise of skywalker on the opening
night fucking hell there must have been 30 freaking minutes of ads there's a lot of ads yeah
i'm just gonna stop showing up on time i'm gonna show up like 20 minutes late for every viewing
well now i want a good seat but jesus
um so many ads go away i would agree that the most inconsistent character has to be hucks
tfa leads us to believe he's a major player in the first order but tlj shows us that he's
that no one takes him seriously and to us made him a traitor for reasons um like we kind of went
over it uh i can follow along that he hates kylo and wants to kill kylo i cannot follow along
the method in which he betrays the first order it's retarded
so yeah i think i think he's inconsistent i just i really think ray is the most inconsistent
she's she acts like a fucking crazy person in this movie
i'm getting season eight flashbacks here stars episode nine rise of incest beautiful
hmm what did the incestuous family do during halloween pumpkin oh
there you go they're cousins and it's in disney comics yeah that must have i think we can tell
what the the point of conversation was at this point uh it really is all about family drama
galaxy spanning stalls is so small that incest happens
yeah it's it's hard enough for it to happen on accident on one planet earth but in a galaxy
be careful who you stick your peepee in yeah force seaman it's uh force that's canon now uh
now we know why he's creamy sheave yep yes that is new canon in legends it was darth
plagus oh so legends is the one that was decanonized yeah
so disney said it wasn't plagus it was palpatine i i'm assuming um i think so okay and use me
the dark side of the force is a pathway to many relationships some consider to be unnatural
sequel trilogy steals everything from original characters invalidates everything they did
and hands their accomplishments to some mary sue pretty much can't deny she saved the universe
from the real palpatine and thousands of star destroyers that's way more of an achievement
than any of the characters from the ot ever managed to pull off yeah that's where lucas
george lucas fucked up he just should have had more but jj made better movies because he just
had more um ros maybe feel more fondly about tlj depression
wait are they saying they've upgraded to depression like that's where they're at now as a result
uh snoke is the most inconsistent um mysterious and imposing character that wants to finish ren's
training and then he's ostentatious dumb and dead and then he's literally created by palpatine and
uses his finger puppet um i mean i don't want to be that guy but it all follows enough doesn't it
you could if he was a clone he could have just been alpatine the whole time
puppeteering him to say the stuff that he said in tfa on the stuff that he said in tlj
i like how the argument is we're just pulling characters out as being weirdly written and
i mean it is all really weird uh i'm just saying like you get to get away with a lot of stuff when
you say that it was palpatine behind his voice the whole time because you can now invent lots
of motivations like why would he talk about being like needing wanting to kill ray and it's like
don't you don't you see he was testing kylo that's what palpatine wanted like there's so many ways
you can sort of brush it all off but i think we all know for a fucking fact that snoke they never
knew what the hell snoke was supposed to be they never decided and then they were just like i don't
know test tube baby lol test tube baby how disappointing for all the people who've made
all those theory videos they like imagine all the possibilities there's a fucking test tube you're
like oh palpatine being alive means vader died for nothing pretty much yeah the only thing that
he managed to achieve still is saving luke's life which is nothing i wouldn't call that small in
any way but he he achieved a lot of other things that are now been destroyed so he didn't bring
balance to the force that's a fucking lie he did not destroy an evil person that he wanted to
destroy because they were causing pain to people he loved like he saved the the kid we didn't kill
that person he failed to do that um and he didn't you know undo the empire really at all actually
and that applies to more than just anakin that's pretty much everyone else too um shad jj listens
to these streams no total of it if we found out jj abrams listens to efab and is like hi never
considered that and he actually like hadn't considered that and he agrees with everything
that we say it just legit never thought about it uh jj directed star trek and star wars yeah he
killed them both from when i hear uh star trek fans are not happy with his work and when he came
over to star wars they were all panicking while star wars fans were like woohoo jj
and then he did force you haven't seen what we've seen yeah well this is the thing um
do you remember that was the funny thing about the red light media video he was like you need
to address that you recommended jj and he was like okay i met as a director not as a writer
like okay that's that's the clarification is like all right
because um yeah i think i think he's probably right i don't see why you couldn't have jj as
a director he seems to know what he's doing with a lot of it it's just that he's just like ryan
cannot tell a story keep him away from the script yeah
merry christmas boys and a happy new year i don't think you're bad er you're way better
you're more real than those fake like quinton and others oh gee thanks yeah you're above quinton
good job you did it so i would like to remind you that quinton you know he said some choice things
in that review we covered so being better than him really isn't much of an achievement at this point
but something cinema reburos bad takes see look at that that's relevant now
we covered him the last jedi really is the christmas miracle that continues to give and give
i mean yes and it's got company now over the films will you make a an ros unbridled rage mauler
yes and i did four redrafts and the audio is all done and uh i even did the pickups for it but
i've noticed a few mistakes along the way editing so that's gonna have to be done but uh we've done
about 15 minutes so i said this before but like that's like one and a half video essays already
so get hype you know the video is two hours so i'm gonna need another week of editing at least
if i really pushed but uh a few weeks at most it is on the way sure this is a
question for shad i guess oh well i guess i'll keep it forward it was really shad a castle
still good idea if you include add the aircraft weapons curious how uh at that point how much
the castle is going to help depending on what kind of technology you're against
um pop that in our collective forums yes indeedy meth and speedy
what to make of that one i don't know it's kind of kind of druggy hmm
this is a good christian stream we don't do drugs here retcon cora so she dies at birth
oh yes sometimes you just gotta make these decisions
um as tismi as mandalorian is uh it at least has heart and i think that's what matters the most
with stalls at this point as long as this intent and heart is there we can just have a sliver of
hope i mean that's probably why i don't i'm probably not gonna go out of my way to shit
all over mandalorian but if people ask me about it i'll tell them it's terrible
i i don't think there's anything malicious in mandalorian like it doesn't destroy any
cannon or lure as far as i'm aware and the fobs though the fob yeah but those are self-contained
to the mandalorian are they though like we need to know how exactly that could create does everybody
have just a signature that anyone can just attach to a fob at some point or do you get injected with
something definitely really really but it's not like it's sort of self-contained kind of in the
way rogue one was kind uh it's mostly yeah it mostly hurts itself mandalorian rather than
anything else yeah it doesn't like no it doesn't really damage other stuff it's its own little
disaster but i will agree that it had like some kind of heart to it like the people who made it
i don't think they hated star wars which is cool no that's where we are now though mando is great
y'all now y'all will be an overly critical it's like i wish that were the case honestly yeah but
we ain't mandalorian's bad bro sorry baby yoda's cute yeah he sure is i don't care baby yoda is
cute there you go victory the show has um who'd win the entirety of a global cinematic sci-fi fantasy
franchise or one mousy boy one mousy boy the mouse always destroys everything you love never
bet against the mouse uh asking which movie's best is like asking which type of terminal cancer i
prefer also first super chat well well oh that's really great glad you finally popped your cherry
this uh all hail the hate mongers of the toxic brood hi wags hail long man hello hello and
question for shad that i will copy and keep will you guys ever do an efap stream on how you would
fully rewrite the latest star wars trilogy either from the ground up or roughly rewriting the
confines of how the story went we did a bit of that in that stream we did like two years ago
if you remember rags one yeah we did yeah the first stream we did on it on our channel
yeah so you can go check that out i guess and we have sort of talked about different ideas there
once in a while but if i was to like be like yes let's commit an entire efap to really lining out
lots of specifics about our trilogy i just be like at that point we should just write our own story
if we're going to use that much of our effort very much man it just it feels it almost feels
worse it's just like yes let's talk about how how much we could have explored loads of different
things loads different efforts and then we get to look at what we actually ended up with well
Jesus guys i watched the start of the stream fell asleep and woke up and y'all are still going
yep we're at 11 31 so we have exactly 23 minutes left um with all the stars movies out how would
y'all rank all 11 films from best to worst and why also fuck mary kill padme layer and
ray slash vader palps kylo uh hmm all right let's start with the ladies first who'd we kill ray
um mary mary leah and mary leah fuck padme leah's got some great character well padme
oh yeah i'm gonna block of wood yeah yeah um but yeah fuck your brains out then then vader
palps and kylo i guess kill palps fuck kylo and mary vader kylo yeah kill palpatine mary vader
fuck kylo there we go actually yeah whenever you say leah i think about leah from the original
yeah yeah yes that's i figured that was the spirit of the question not fucking ancient leah
um all puppeted dead layer from fucking episode night i hope that's not the involvement but um
er redemption arc reveals he was a goodman all along and quinton was the true racist nazi
everything went according to his plan er lured q quinton out i guess this wasn't interesting evap
yep quite the flip of the stakes if you will we were subverted in our expectations
quite and i i see the turntable uh you just started reading super chats
that's a weird one to read halfway the toward the end of this one but yeah okay and it's got
a milking edge even the live streams are eight hours long you guys are this committed to this
long form thing um kind of it's sort of what we do we well this stream would have ended
at around 10 hours if not for the overflow so 10 hours is much more reasonable than 12 is it not
i'm glad we i think so um i'm dumb can someone please explain the steamboat meme
the steamboat they don't fucking bad who showed us that with it
that was yeah that was bad and that was funny as shit
yeah what are like the unmentionables it's like don't talk about that that never happened
happy new year guys favorite star wars moment like of all time
um hmm when obi when kenobi drops down and there definitely the best uh the best star wars moment
of all time i really like when it kicks up and they do the second death star run lando into the
center once the shields are down that moment is so like here we fucking go um i my favorite might be
um ray dying was pretty sweet she didn't stay dead that moment was ruined
yeah well that part isn't i'm not going to count that part as canon in my head canon she fucking
stays dead uh obviously i don't know it would luke fight invader is a big thing at all
i was just about to say that yeah luke fight invader wait the first or second time
both of them are great this is the problem there's so many moments
maybe the um well maybe we should do the one from each movie like what's your favorite star wars
moment from each movie so phantom man it's pretty obvious um there's the darthmore fight
yeah that was actually legit badass the attack of the clones would probably be yuku versus obi one
that was pretty good one of the clones swoop in at the end that was kind of nifty yeah like when
the war starts between the clones of the droids or something yeah um episode three yeah i'd say that
hmm i quite like order 66 that whole bit yeah that scene really nifty i i liked the uh the obi one
the obi one what you got obi one grievous fight um before they get on the little vehicle things
i'm not a huge fan of it because of there's just so much there's so much movement with the forearms
i can't really tell what's happening
i love grievous though like the design of him um i wish well i like the like the assaulting the
ship at the beginning was kind of yeah the opening battle and this is the thing there's
a lot of moments in episode three they're pretty good too um i guess though yeah any of the ones
we just mentioned pretty much could probably make it there um episode four
probably goes far as just going with the uh the death star run toward the end
yeah the death star thing's really good um i almost want to say the the the break
leia's breakout scene yeah you know when they're fighting the troopers there in that hallway i
thought that was really great they're just it's that's such a i don't know it's just a star wars
moment then i guess episode five would be luke versus vader yeah i'm thinking so that whole fight
was just long but good attention the great atmosphere because the location you know i mean
i mean the uh yeah the the lighting and the cinematography for lack of a more specific word
is just fucking fantastic in that whole fight vader looks spooky like he does like he's really
menacing um and then episode six i guess we kind of covered those so should we get to the fun part
what's your favorite moment from force awakens um
oh this is easy for me go on yeah i'm dying that shit kills me to this day
wait what part is your favorite part on dying oh right um yeah i can see how it would be pretty
funny at this point oh are we are we have we so have we transitioned ironically yeah if we're
choosing like an ironic strong moments in these films um
i guess introduction of ray showing a lot about the way she lives without having to say anything
yeah is that like the only part of ray ever pretty much i i argue that like it ends after
that in terms of us understanding her it's like it's over from there uh there's that one other bit
where she comments on how she's never seen so much green in the world before i quite like that
huh yeah so little because jay jay squeezed it in and then in right skywalker he just couldn't
get any of it in the han and chewy intro is a suggestion from chat i hated seeing him as a
washed up loser this is the thing i was gonna say we'll probably end up choosing like you know like
for tlj it's like when luke meets up with r2 when luke finally gets to talk to leah these moments
that we have to steal all right um how about like pose like return like right they're on the temple
planet with mos canada and poke him in and he shoots the tie fighters you know like wow that's
he's really a skilled pilot he's really competent and cool and amazing i can't wait to see him go on
i have heard the complaints in the next movie he's a little bit too good he knocks out like
ridiculous amount of enemies in the span is something i want to say this is probably ridiculous
right but it's something like 15 enemies in the course of like a single 20 second shot or
something he like just shoots the shit and naturally out of fucking everything and i want
to highlight that like i'm like he's supposed to be the best pilot that's fine but they have their
limits right he's like ridiculously good and upon like sort of thinking about it i was kind of like
yeah it is kind of a little bit like superheroish and then i think about the fact that it's jj's
work and i'm like oh right yeah everything has to be fucking amazing doesn't it
like how how in depth we've gotten this question this is like really thank you about it all right
episode from the last jedi favorite scene is probably luke luke and r2 luke and r2 that's easy
fucking next movie the rise of skywalker your what's your favorite moment it's fucking every
scene with c3po yeah oh when except for the one where he gets his memory wiped but like the scene
in the cave and the scene when they're on bluff overlooking the village like unironically my
favorite scene is those two with or are those two with them i like chewy and han seeing each other as
well these things are very thin but i mean that is the question so like literally characters seeing
each other is enough for me to be like oh there we go the best moment in the whole film them seeing
each other also barbie frick barbie frick of course that just goes without saying anything
with barbie frick in it uh joker and scene but it's er's smile debut
fair enough four minutes is not long rags vader fight is four minutes
it seems like it goes on longer than that though and something else is happening at the same time
yeah long is totally it feels longer yeah er with his so-called nazi jokes to normie
normie what's so funny er you wouldn't get it he's joker references um all right uh watching
rise of skywalker gave me such a pure form of enjoyment as i watched disney mangle the already
dead remains of star wars truly a celestial film agreed truly tis i went in with very low
expectations and i laughed the entire time especially when the force heal and rape help
teen twist reveal fucking hilarious hi rags hello yeah it was pretty funny i just got out of rise
of skywalker holy shit that was a garbage movie silver lining it was i was on a date when i saw
it and we both thought it was shit so i know she's a keeper merry christmas yeah smash that
merry christmas long man hi rags hello merry christmas does frantic and confused
screaming count as a critique if so then call me roger fucking ebert
well then good luck to you and your your ebert level critique and analysis in the form of a rant
slash in go here and rambling it's all good uh finn wanted to ask ray when his character arc
was going to begin yeah uh i was actually thought that finn might have had a shot in this film to
be developed and that's why i was so sure that he would be the inconsistent one because they'd
fuck it up but he they just don't give a fuck he's just a big old goofball
um how does shad think revenge of the sith has the best duel crazy well i think he's going
strictly from um like fencing rules sort of thing he's got videos on it he goes into depth onto why
return the revenge of the sith the the duel that anakin and obi one have is um
he gives it quite good marks for all the moves they're using
so he's from that perspective i think is what he's going for
um but i can i'll save that for him so he can answer himself
on how much info can you get from a necklace every star has a unique met metallicity
it is possible the necklace retained enough of these properties
um it seems ridiculous that's all i don't think it's impossible that you could scan a necklace
and know which planet it's from it just seems ridiculous it's better than him recognizing
it himself the fact that he gave it away to be analyzed it's like all right
that's something happens really fast though
i guess if he asks for it they get like they're like oh fuck he's asking for it
oh god video of mauler is darth maul and jj and rs as a jedi no that means they kill me eventually
that would be terrible we don't want that the guy in my cinema burst out laughing at the reylo part
yeah i've honestly a lot of people been saying that uh i wrote my comments spear of the moment
but what i meant to say is they turned ray into the avatar at the end i thought there
were similarities with the whole like connection with all the past versions or whatever yeah there
are sadly i'll be going into those into in a little more detail it's fun stuff
if you're afraid it won't count one star give it two stars
oh about yeah like if you give it the lowest rating and they don't get counted on rotten
tomatoes i don't think people should just people just need to stop caring about rotten tomatoes
at this point yeah man shit don't worry about it like really don't worry about it
y'all spend more time here thinking creativity creatively and insightfully about this film than
the sequel producers and directors ever thought about star wars um a director has a lot on their
plate but if we're talking strictly about the writing it does feel that way um i don't know
how much time they actually get for the script but again just uh goddamn i would love to have
these extended conversations with some of them just to see what their attitude is as a whole
to understand it a bit better uh for me tlj is by far the worst movie without its gross
incompetence woke stupidity and hack writing rise of skywalker might have had a chance
that's a false hope
um yeah i guess uh do you think it was salvageable with just the false awakens
in the trilogy what do you think it was already over not at all it was already over
yeah bad jumping off when i mean it already validated the ending to dot
i don't think so up from that
um this is the problem so you'd need a whole bunch of information on how we got
because this is the thing like are we supposed to believe that no one bad ever rose again
in in the universe as a significant selection of people i'd be like well no i'm sure that
i think it definitely would have been not impossible and that well yeah and then it's
like what did the remnants of the empire do there's totally a story there
um because there's still a significant portion of them surely
gotta be um they're just without leaders or at least uh the significant leaders they've
still got probably captains and generals everyone so well different places so there's a story there
it's kind of one again um if they all collected back up and they created the first order
and if we came up with an actual like explanation for who and what snoke is
i i don't know i feel like i mean surely you'd agree that we have a better chance at that point
than we do with tlj on top of tfa well sure but um i guess you so you think we'd probably still
end up with a bad movie regardless yeah it's just more bad stack on bad
i don't know i'm kind of hopeful that i think it's salvageable somewhere payers i still don't
think it's good i think we could have done a whole lot better yeah i don't know you invented ray
that was already a humongous mistake true true and with all of these things i just
be like how can we fix them how can we repair all this shit um for example like throw good ideas
like could ray have been tricking them this whole time tidz out ray is actually a double agent or
something like that you know like like what are all the things we can do to try and fix this shit
that's real optimism i know i know but uh we could do a hell of a lot better than the last
jedi and then if we can do that then maybe we can do a hell of a lot better with two films in the
trilogy in the attempts of fixing and creating a stronger story i suppose i just you know goddamn
what we got sucked that's that's all it really sucked yeah ray i'm a skywalker and you gotta deal
with it j is 3po and er is r2 i want to be j and er
wait are they trying to say that r2 is a racist that is oh my god i mean if anybody yeah i guess
makes sense here when i wake here when i sleep love y'all love er well thank you i was so excited
on the eve of riser skywalkers release because i knew the garbage on the horizon would keep me
entertained for years to come love y'all hi rags and see y'all in 2020 see you in 2020 yeah um
i'll read a couple more and then we'll sort of sign out oh this one just says belch
oh hi all right molar unbridled rage or unbridled meh oh this is definitely a um i'm pretty pissed
at this movie oh it had the potential to not fucking destroy the end of return of the jedi
didn't it it chose to it's like well you could have you could have avoided the bullet a little
a little harder instead of just fucking running with it could have tried
uh j is gucci clinton also oh where zdah
i don't know what to make of this also oh zdah
i will i got nothing on that oh where zdah
i feel like they're trying to make me say a different word but i don't know what it is
yeah i'm not sensing any dog whistles in there um hello wags like a weird version of that
like with everything moved over maybe maybe yeah it could be especially with the also
also hi rags is one of the most common things though yeah also had this hello i don't know
i don't know he stumped us no clue i think it's hello uh hello wags probably
i like to think so because it involves me um as a proper zig i approve of this brood 10 out of 10
would evolve as a critic again also hi molar hello while watching tros tried to contain my
laughter to be courteous to those around me place was completely packed but when it got to the scene
where kylo rent dies i lost it i laugh my ass off no fucks assuming it says given yes
well i can't blame you um
and epsin didn't commit suicide he previewed riser skywalker
that explains it do you think rlm will split a half in the bag episode between tros and cats
that was actually i think something that i had thought about
would have been good would have made sense that would have been hilarious everyone in this chat
go to rotten tomatoes and give it two stars rotten tomatoes doesn't count one star reviews
its audience score is only high because of that i think there's more to it even than that
something fishy going on over there definitely something fishy uh took a friend who had no
idea about the leaks and is a lifelong fan this movie infuriated her more than tlj knowing the
leaks helped me not to throw anyone off a roof thank you doomcock here um what a little friend
though er come back and kick them all okay kick who all right um fuck you quinton look at it
backwards oh because he spelled it cuff i get it um and with that i think just to make sure we
don't i don't cut anything too much off i have taken a chunk of the overflow out uh we're getting
through it like i said the next one we'll probably add to it and unless uh me and rags can spot
some time to do any fap many of these things but it'd be a bad idea i got the time i got the time
now christmas is done a lot of family stuff is done i think i'm i think i'll have the time
i'm downright tired i think that's my guess uh but that brings us to the end thank you very much
everybody i'm gonna do collect up some more of the memes that came in today for next time
and uh thank you to all the guests for staying as long as they did and er you made it to the full
12 hour how do you feel hello haggard uh it's been fun for a good cause thank you all for
joining us we will catch you in the future my video is on the way more stuff from from efap
and rags and myself to come uh good night everybody and have a good new year if you don't see us
until after it good night everyone goodbye we made it bye fucking hate trump
