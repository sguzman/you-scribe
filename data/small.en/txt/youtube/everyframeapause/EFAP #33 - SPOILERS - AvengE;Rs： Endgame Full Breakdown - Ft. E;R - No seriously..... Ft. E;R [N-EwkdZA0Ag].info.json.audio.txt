go I like how when you see streams from like any other person online they'll
have like a you know like a big opening thing like in a set thing and it's
almost like getting to the point with efap now or I don't even want us to
make one because it's just it's too much it's too normal for efap to just not
have an opening just for us to be fucking talking about something what do
you mean you know like no how would you day rags oh it was okay
they've done all right so far see I was born talk to someone else wolf how was
your day it's been going swell mmm boring to yo how was your day okay my
day was amazing I flew a dragon into it no I've run out of creativity to
everything sucks so we live in a post-end game world oh is that true how
do you know they're not gonna make endgame 2 ah this is Marvel after all
and Ender game and this game I haven't actually seen that have you guys it's
not good no I haven't read the book so I don't I'm not speaking on the quality
of that but the movie was pretty weak well isn't that it had like fucking
Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley yeah he put forth his good old don't give a fuck
about what I'm doing acting in there too all right Harrison Ford I've put out the
tweet as well I'm on I'm on fire today with doing things properly how good is
that you guys what you made a tweet you need a thumbnail mm-hmm oh I should be
president way go I am the best oh you know what to start off I need to get
these things out of the way when you left wolf there was like seven super
chats in a row asking you questions fuck so did you write them down yes I've got
them so the first one was wolf my dad and I watched all six Middle Earth films
each year I enjoy the Hobbit films the Lord the Rings is objectively better how
would you improve the Hobbit films I would remake them completely feeling
that's what it would be I mean I enjoy watching them but they're not good is
that all you want to say what about what about the one and tweak you would make
what's the one biggest tweak make it fuck I don't know I that I could that
could make a whole fucking video in and of itself I would make I would make
Bilbo a strong independent black lesbian Jewish fuck up he was that did you ever
ask what he identified as what she identified as no I said well they
I don't how dare you miss gender Bilbo Baggins how dare you assume you've
misgendered Bilbo back that's offensive as well this is a conversation that
people have probably had unironically probably at some point wolf that is one
of the worst parts of manga slash anime they can't just show it they have to show
it and explain it over and over again I'm not sure what it was entirely
referencing oh I think it was I was talking about how anime will actually
fucking tell like explain shit to you whereas a lot of movies now they're just
like you can fucking figure it out on your own and come up with answers you
can write the movie for it this one was from bail and the interstellar Marines
book art was rather iridescent wouldn't you say a wolf and that's a reference to
the oh yes yeah I remember that yes I I did notice that good old blessed bail
and iridescent yes hmm Rags doesn't like it well I can't I probably can't
remember it because it was so generic and dull is like I'm speed marine man
can space use my gun I shoot things that was interstellar Marines though yes
differently just different movies I clearly wrote interstellar Marines oh
yeah it was your first work right yeah I take all I take all credit for Joseph
Anderson's interstellar Marines interstellar Marines it's a video game
all right I got that that's definitely not it then you go rings book we've
already read this rags no I just got to remember the cover oh yeah it's an
extremely wrote re-swoke up from cryostasis like a second birth um what
yeah we read this on stream I remember reading part of it with yeah that was
that's like the first sentence oh God oh Jesus well you know sometimes when
media isn't particularly gripping you often forget it and maybe that's a good
thing so the next one says I wasn't upset I was making a joke about him
ragging on Jay when he was 25 years behind in world of time hashtag
misrepresented so I think you said shit about Jay for not catching up with Lord
the Rings and someone said that you were behind in world of time but they were
just they were just joking yeah there's one that says well several worlds of
time except for that one place in dr. strange which apparently doesn't have
time for some reason obviously oh doormammu yeah it's doormammu
wolf why won't you just love me I can only love one okay people might be able
to put that into a fat me wolf don't leave the fault folders getting massive
the folder is getting massive I guess they're referencing to me having to write
these down I'm not sure ah no wolf the third Pirates the Caribbean is better
than the first I will debate you on this okay third better than the first
fucking god how can you hold that position that's not yeah I can't remember
who exactly sent that but um end of efap damn well goodbye wolf see what I mean
they just kept sending once for one of these videos has been hit with a
copyright but it's still a bit oh oh that wasn't for you that was for me I
think yes so okay that's it we did it there you go well yeah Pirates of the
Caribbean 3 is like the citizen Kane of pirate themed movies why would you say
that because of the because it's the saltiest and that defines the pirate
exists I'd say it's more like the mummy 3 of pirate movies mummy 3 of pirate
movies yeah the mummy 3 is the mummy 3 of mummy movies and is true that's
your opinion though like I'll just go around saying shit like that dude what a
terrible movie the the arrival debate video has got another copyright thing on
it but it's not one that takes it away from being available apparently it said
unavailable in a selection of countries that was a huge list but apparently like
I tested it I was still available for UK in America so you know that's the ones
that matter and it's been I challenged it we've only recently I think I'm only
about to get the other ones back the the Mission Impossible ones they're still
available but fucking hell this this shit is annoying cuz like the whole
point of us playing video essay videos that they don't get hit with copyright
because those videos are up but somehow that doesn't work that way so oh and the
other thing was um efap movies so a lot of people wanted so this is this is for
assuming all the people who watched efap movies watch this podcast as well
people want us to release the full audio track or efap movies the thing is
that um they're a supercut of me wolf and rags reacting to movies because a
lot of the time we should be quiet listening to what the actual movie even
has because half the time one of us hasn't seen it and then we'll make
comments and maybe some jokes don't land or the pacing gets screwed up and the
way that I can supercut it means all of our jokes land mauler yes without even a
little hop there is the point is there is no original track because it's all
just recorded flat like I don't have separate audio files and then the video
it's really slapdash so I do audio commentaries on my main channel with
main films and I'm probably do more of them as time goes on but efap movies is
like its own format and I feel like this isn't the last time I'm gonna have to
say that but hey hopefully that helps for people who are looking for it it's
two more on the way and yeah that's that's about that so intro stuff done
welcome special guest e colon are that's how it goes right hmm yeah just
about finally breaking nofap here hmm how do you how is life life is good you
um you've seen a few of these episodes that we do this insane podcast yeah yeah
one or two how have you have you been finding it from what you've seen too
short to my case well we're trying to fix these things you know it's difficult
but a lot of time like rags and we'll just have to leave so we only end up
with like you know seven hours or so it's just like you know guys we got to
start bringing provisions with us that's true things like bring one of those like
like do it while sitting on some form of a exercise bike maybe just keep your
limbs from or like keep from bed sores appearing but call people in case you
never hear from me again you know here's where I am it's like the ultimate
yeah will be 30 hours call the cops I keep bringing pizza for a long show but
then rags tells me I'm a bad man for suit for doing that that's true he says
bad for you yeah but it gets me through long things long things bad long things
good if you have pizza hmm circle things good so let's um let's if we're
gonna start this cuz we're here today to talk about a movie that came out you
guys heard of it it's called Avengers Endgame I think yeah it's that one about
the superheroes doing shit and stuff oh yeah there's a big purple guy in it so
purple man good I figure let's see how does this come on screen there we go
perfect I'll start with I guess getting like a thumbs up or down for the film
that's the that's a nice way of putting it and that can mean anything but why
don't we go one at a time start from the left wolf thumbs up or down for Avengers
Endgame thumbs up interesting yeah I'm kind of perfectly balanced between them
thumbs all thing neutral I'm just gonna put thumbs loop rags I think it's thumbs
up and I'm going with thumbs up as well now you'd be like what the fuck does that
even mean I don't even know actually that could mean anything to all of us
so now let's do the really fun bit give an estimated guess of what you would
assume the objective sort of ranking this one gets out of a ten and non
committal this is a number that will probably change within the next ten
seconds minutes or hours just what are you what would you give it as a number
out of ten mr. wolf off you go oh by the way like spoilers oh well it's in the
title yeah we're gonna be spoiling the shit out of this movie so if you
haven't seen it Iron Man dies why would you well yeah go see spoilers go see the
there's other spoilers so go see the movie if you haven't watch this podcast
another time if if not you know there we are there's warnings in the tweet
and in the title I don't know why anybody at this point but some people
don't even want to watch it right so and they're just like fuck talk about so
moving on from that yes spoilers what are you what would you give it out of
ten wolf this is objective right yeah doing your best to sort of rank it as a
story ah I'm gonna go between like a five or a six cool there five maybe yeah
that'd be a good one yeah yeah I'll go five mm-hmm regs in the middle it's
really tough because they they do a lot of time travel stuff and when and when
you do time travel it's one of those weird sorts of things we're like well
how come they couldn't do this or how come they could do this and what exactly
are the specific rules so it's really really tough to it's really really tough
for now I'm gonna go with a six because is just going after one viewing I'm
gonna give it a six but we'll see how that goes so far because when I was
watching it I I couldn't think of like anything massive as I was watching it
maybe I just missed it but I guess we'll see for me probably like I didn't want
it to be so similar for everybody but yeah I probably I feel like this could
change but it's probably a five for me I don't know how shocking they're all
pretty much in the same range then yeah which I mean looking at it very
neutrally as an average it's like seems like most of us already agreed on
exactly what we're getting from this film so why not explore why huh does
anybody want to I mean you still probably do a counter again at the end
just to see if we changed our minds it'll learn anything was it better than
Infinity War for everybody here no I liked it more than Infinity War all
right well I thought it was better but yeah okay well let's get into it I
suppose does anyone want to say anything before we start trying to go through
basically scene by scene with this thing fat Thor was really I hated it I mean it
was funny at first but they kept the joke going for way too fucking long but
that's the thing I don't think it was a joke I mean I don't know about the rest
of you but I thought there was too much comedy in the movie I mean it not
that it didn't land for me I'd say most of it landed but I felt like it took
away from the serious aspects to throw jokes every couple minutes well again
we should probably we'll do it we'll totally talk about Thor and everything
else someone just reminded me I should probably do a subjective take as well
that makes the most sense so fuck it I am that's weird they I thought the I
didn't really get much out of the comedy from this one there was a few things
but I thought it was way less of a comedy than like Infinity War was I
probably agree with that but again we'll we'll we'll try and break it down piece
by piece but uh so what did you personally get out of it out of 10 wolf
Oh subjectively yeah hmm I don't know that ending pretty much seals it for
I'd say seven seven all right yeah I'm still down there at five mmm mr. Rags
man I think I think subjectively this was like a nine or ten for me I'll call
it a nine point five and yeah it was like a nine but it's totally gonna
change as time goes on and I think about it more I already know that but uh I was
on an emotional high for this one all right I know right so the fucking that
you open with like Hawkeye with his family do it doing shit the first thing
it could be already pointed out is like why is it daytime in America and in
Africa it's weird it's like who's fucking depicts like I mean yeah but like
it's not hard to film like a scene where it's nighttime with Hawkeye well they
could have done it indoors and it would have had the same effect where they you
know disappear and everything they could have been shooting yeah but yeah that is
a mistake and that's yeah it's mostly just well how we considered the
perspective of the movie if the world is flat would still be Africa and in the
US you know what you fucking nailed it I think this is gonna be the movie to
reinvigorate the flight of society but uh yeah I kind of like the they changed
it up with this one like I thought I thought that man the was totally wasted
the the fading to dust ash whatever scene it just shows it after he's in the
things like oh all right but this one I kind of like the whole you know he
didn't see them when they did it sort of thing and he's just on his own it's
pretty cool yeah Captain Marvel does save I had bad but thank God she's
barely in the movie oh yeah yes like holy fuck when she find when she was like
you it's gonna be a while before you see me again I was like oh my god thank you
I know I've in the theater I was like yes um yeah for those for those of you
who don't know first off if you haven't seen it why are you here but yeah but
like nebula gets way more screen time than Captain Marvel she's a pretty solid
character in this movie yeah care for her in Guardians but I liked her a lot
oh dude I kid about her in the audience especially after yeah I cared about her
yeah more so in Guardians 2 I barely even remember what yeah yeah um yeah she's
just introduced in the face the second one when her and Gamora hug at the end I
was like oh man honestly kind of felt like this was nebula's movie in a way
you know thank like maybe obviously it's more about cap and Iron Man but she
I believe she had more screen time than the outside of Iron Man Thor and cap and
like one I remember someone doing a breakdown of it she's got like extremely
high screen time compared to others and I guess it makes sense because it's too
yeah I think it's like 48 minutes or something um I don't remember the exact
number but I know what screenshot you're talking about then they did use her to
be like integral to the story the way that events play out she's very
important to all that so yes it wasn't just like here she is you know there's a
reason for all of it they worked into the film but thank God very little
Captain Marvel we'll still we'll start to talk about the past as she did it
though yeah so what I was just gonna say is so like for clarification I'm
assuming Captain Marvel found Iron Man thanks to did the guys in the Avengers
compound tell him see here's the thing mauler Captain Marvel as was established
in the movie Captain Marvel is the best at everything at all times that ever was
and ever will be most likely so the fact that she was able to find a derelict
spaceship in the black void of space yeah if you guys remember what they're
scanning through all of the people who have died and they say like yep so
Thanos was successfully developed is a great shot where you see Tom Holland's
face and Iron Man puts his head down when he sees it's just like oh cool but
um they also showed Nick Fury and then it shows her and she reacts to it and I
was like wait so is this the first time she's been back at the Avengers compound
because she came in at the end of her movie right I was just continuity wise
I was like she's been here before right yeah she asks where's Fury yes I'm
assuming that all runs and then so and I just want to think about this like so
why did they send her to get Iron Man instead of just getting Thor to do it
probably because they just wanted her out of the house I just I don't like
thematically I was like wouldn't it be way better for Thor to see you know a
disheveled and dying Iron Man and being like let's get the you get you the fuck
out of here did it have to be Marvel yeah because it's been they just they
sure he can travel faster than her to go no one can travel faster than Captain
Marvel he's asked her stronger smiter faster here she's not pretty higher
faster further she's not even prettier than fat Thor oh guys did you love her
fucking bringing in their ship by like Carrie get with their arms or whatever I
was like what the fuck I think I don't know how I expected to get them back but
she literally carried it from God knows how far away to earth really yeah she's
the look mauler she's the best at everything that ever was okay she's the
best mm-hmm that ever was at everything she's the strongest Avenger yeah I got
no way to complain about any of that I just well beyond like I wish something
else had happened but it all might makes enough sense I don't even know what her
powers really are I said this before I have no idea could someone tell me like
in simple vision other than saying she's a god what the fuck is in simple terms
as logically powerful as is possible logically yes air quotes you know to be
an asshole just like how do you even grab a spaceship and well if you if you
traveled at who retarded speed of light thing we just rip off a panel of the
ship because she no she didn't take off all at once she started slow and then
she worked her way up to two mega light speed as fast as the ship was able to go
which should still take her ages to get back but at this point we're trying to
do we're trying to discuss the power level of Captain Marvel good luck future
MC yeah so when I'm I guess there I thought that stuff was really good like
the whole I lost the kid to cap in pepper as well I was like ah nailed it
nailed all of it even though it's not really hard to do that oh that's
actually a thought Robert Downey Jr's performance in this movie is it not like
11 out of 10 I think it was stellar yeah I mean Jesus you really own this one
oh I mean he knew this would be like his last thing man I he just oh he just went
for it it was all there everything about is like like bright is fucking like
calling out cap in the in the bit after that that oh I'm the scene when he gets
back yeah and he's on the IV yeah and he's like pissed oh that that did a
really good job kind of establishing the mood of where the Avengers are at the
moment and how a lot of people are feeling it just really set a good tone
yes where people kind of were seeing him like so thin and yeah I was like Jesus
Christ oh yeah you know I don't know I'm guessing they did that just so that they
would not have him go after Thanos I guess because there's no there's no need
for Captain Marvel to have taken that long to find them they could have just
found them straight away so I wonder what the intention was behind that other
than to I don't know get him to get a bit of a bond with nebula and to make
him sort of near death
as a writing perspective I'm not even sure of what exactly they're going for
but then you know wig the further we go on the more you'll be asking that
question I quite liked that he said you know the line from age of Ultron where
cap says if we lose we'll lose together and then he says we didn't lose
together you weren't there they call them a liar I was like oof though this
is so broad to my attention I was like fuck back at Infinity War the assumption
was the Doctor Strange couldn't open portals to earth from that far away from
earth or something like an arbitrary assumption it's like okay we know that's
not true now at the end of this movie so why couldn't they've just opened a portal
to earth while on Titan and been like hey can you guys send some backup ready
for when Thanos gets here they actually say on the way in Infinity War that
we've got no backup I'm just like yeah cuz in Doctor Strange the portals you
know the portal start happening we're like whoa that's really powerful but
they don't really discuss any of the limitations of it yeah that's aside from
talking about how he chopped Thanos arm off with it or fuck just put it
underneath Thanos and send him to the Himalayas the second that actually no
we're just in space shop his head off what about him in space would that work
he die what if he's like Captain Marvel oh one out of 14 million choices and
apparently cutting his head off wouldn't as a wouldn't be a choice I guess yeah a
lot of people really liked from what I could tell the whole killing Thanos like
in the first 15 minutes in the movie guys find that shocking shocking yes I
wasn't a big fan of the decision surprised a little bit but I kind of
feel like that's something they would do it's clearly because they wanted to go
a completely unexpected direction with the movie right they were like you guys
think that they'll get the gauntlet off him or that they'll have to fight him to
get it back or the blah blah blah blah blah metal said the first time you see
Thanos he's floating in space isn't he he's in like he's on some kind of planet
but it looks like his phone in space I'm pretty sure he's in a sort of force the
form of atmosphere I'm sure he doesn't do well with space compared unless he
really is like Captain Marvel which will just be sad then again Thor survives in
space and maybe Thanos can I guess because the thing about killing him
immediately and he said he used the stones to destroy the stones was I the
only person that kind of thought it was uncomfortable that the fact the stones
can even be destroyed when they're supposed to be like four elements like
they destroy one in Infinity War and I was always just like I don't understand
how do you destroy the stones using the stones well I guess the power I because
it's the power of the stones has been kind of ambiguous some of them more
than others but I'm down with the idea that the combination of all the stones
together can be like maybe the only thing that can destroy themselves I'm
supposed I suppose I could see that yeah I'm fine with that because it does
show like the only thing that can destroy them you can't really destroy
them using conventional means it's like a special one-time sort of something
that happens mm-hmm I mean we don't see it either well yeah I'm sorry I'm down
I'm I'm okay with the idea that you can use all of the stones together to
destroy them so they can't be used again they didn't get to ask Thanos
about why he wouldn't just give more resources to everybody I was hoping they
would throw that in yeah like please do it okay so I was gonna say this brings
us to the first what the fuck um the rat saves the universe
yeah boy I'm is that part of the whole one out of a 40 million thing
um
I
I guess when I was watching it I didn't have a problem with it I feel like maybe
they could have done something better than just a random rat walks into it I
don't you I don't have a guy who's like yeah we're gonna sell this thing it's
like what is it he just starts pressing buttons ran he's like I have no fucking
idea and there's like whoa what the hell I think that would have been better
it would have been more it would have had the option for them to just have a
more real real ish scene in would have felt like it fleshed out the world a
little bit better because if especially if it's just some random guy and they
could have been talking about oh how man after everything vanished things have
been so weird so there's all these cars left and yeah yeah they could have done
that is like all the cars that you know no one claimed after being vanished like
what do they do with them like they're everywhere they have to get taken care
of somehow and this is one of those vehicles and then this one's weird it's
got this weird console upon it was it a radio and they start flicking with it
and bloop I just like the Alex I was watching with him the silver the second
the rat did it he was like oh no it's like oh yeah that's that's all good
because the thing is like the whole one out of 14 million chances because a lot
of people been saying that that rat is what that means even if it is like how
would dr. strange have any control over that he can't know that that you can't
do anything that would make it so the rat does it that time you know what I
mean it's just like why do that why base the entire plot on a rat pressing a
button it's a weird thing but fine you know missed opportunity I would say to
flush out the world yeah like why not take a post infinity gauntlet world you
know because it just seems natural to me that someone would find the as they
did they would find and they just like what the fuck does this thing even do
because it's like all is may as well be alien technology weird machine in the
back but yeah so Scott seeing his daughter growing up I don't know how
many people you guys probably don't really care about a man that much but
like didn't she seemed a little too old I was like if you had five years to the
daughter she she's grown up well she looked like she was like 20 and I was
like oh no okay yeah I guess cuz that's gonna have to stay now so I was like oh
that sucks cuz I kind of liked the the actress bullgill I did too I thought
they they you know had a good you had a good thing going it man of the daughter
yeah well what can you do a but they actually the ages might be accurate for
all I know and they'd one just looked old and one looked young for their
actual ages I don't even know so what does everyone think of the whole the
fact that they skipped five years that's probably a pretty good question to have
actually started on here I like it
you know I have really no opinion on that well because there's implications
right like I never would have gone with five years personally because it fucks
everything up post-end game for first of all let's talk about a fun one age
laws who come back are gonna be to do is to find out age laws is if like if a
baby gets vanished when the baby comes back what age is the baby because then
you'll be able to tell oh it's five years now oh yeah it could probably be
solved eventually but holy fuck like it would definitely be very a very
confusing thing but I think that's just gonna be a nature of an event of this
scale and magnitude it's what it's it's just something that does have these weird
impacts on humanity only if they're just gonna have to get used to you could
probably have like several films could talk about all the like social political
implications of all of this like having half the universe booped out for five
years or let's just say half of it and then they all come back like fucking hell
how how fucked with everything be and I imagine most MCU films just gonna try
and skirt around it and be like it worked out it worked out it was like
like speed thing with TLJ we're just never going to talk about that again
can you imagine if any one government on earth lost the majority of the people in
it I mean it would definitely be it would be like this is a world-changing
most this is the most important historical event in all of you know
human civilization yeah like world-building because the one on the
conclusions I came to this was like the world of the MCU was already struggling
but I think it's just destroyed now you can't really recover like if you do a
time jump that huge you need to do a lot of world building and the movie didn't
really do that yeah I guess it depends how they how they deal with it moving
forward there's probably more of that we'll maybe try and touch on it as we as
we go along but yeah the the idea being that everyone had to deal with the with
the loss it wasn't undone which by the way I like that as a benefit of the fact
that they did all of this the way they did it infinity war did happen so Loki
did die vision did die the more is dead like everyone was calling that those
would be undone but they went good right um yeah I mean it's a shame especially
when you think about how much you kind of want to see you know you want to see
Loki you want to see you know these people but you know obviously they're
gonna do something with Loki and his weird fucking I'm guessing he gets a TV
show and then there's a blanket Gamora so it's not entirely that they're all
gone but hey the yeah I mean the Gamora reset was a Gamora's lost two movies of
development that's gonna be I don't know how they can deal with that like redo
here in Star-Lord relationships I wonder if Guardians 3 is going to be set
before end game or after it oh yeah I didn't think of that oh well here's the
thing if they have another Guardians we'll get more Thor oh god yeah I'm so
ready for that I really want that so much I really really want to see that
um yeah I'm trying to think of like way to sort of jump too nice so the kind of
the time travel idea fucking hell yeah so Tony figures it out after like three
tries or whatever like really fucking quickly and again people have been
talking about how yeah don't you get it this is the one out of 14 mill just you
can't keep saying that do they establish it's his third attempt cuz I can't
remember I can't I said that with the details because I know that I'm pretty
sure he sets it up as like this is gonna take a while and then he goes holy shit
or something like that because it's like it works with the first few tries what
is does he what does he learn from the conversation with Ant-Man and Black Widow
and Captain America on the porch and everything that allows him yeah that he
didn't know before that it's possible I guess which is lame right cuz it's like
really it is quick that he's like oh okay it's possible and he just figures
it out and the easy fix for this in my opinion would be to not have killed
Hank Pym and to have him and Tony work together as a sort of like a nice little
character moment for them both but also explain how two of the smartest guys on
this planet could come up with it would be like okay I can get that yeah but
Tony just sort of does it it's like oh his banner is working on it his you know
working on it elsewhere and then Tony's working on it elsewhere they're not
together they both kind of come to you know some advancement in it sort of on
their own mm-hmm way too fast as far as I'm concerned but I get a couple of
those things in this movie hulk dabbing whole general was right what were they
doing with Hulk in this movie I feel like the kind of flubbed Hulk like I'm
okay with the concept of Hulk and Bruce Banner kind of becoming like one but you
gotta show that happen because I don't know how he went from Infinity War to
whatever the fuck is going on and endgame Hulk was an odd one yeah I he
definitely was he was like 90% banner right yeah like the only part of him
that was Hulk seemed to be the body yeah there was never any moments of rage
where he had to stop himself is like oh breathe in and out something that he
does to control himself but yeah he's like 90% Bruce Banner and I'm like well
he looks green and big I feel like it's almost as if this movie wasn't written
by the people who made Infinity War a little bit because you're like oh they're
clearly setting up that or the Hulk is gonna have some kind of identity crisis
and he needs to bring them together and if it resulted in Professor Hulk as it's
known I think that'd be great but we didn't get even a scene of like normal
Banner and Hulk having some kind of back-and-forth figuring out the process
like why that'll be so easy that would that would be like a scene you would
have before the five-year cut yeah you know everyone's getting over it you know
Banner loses it and then the whole you know there's two banners to plan a
payment Hulk you could be like if you'd worked with me if you'd worked with us
we might have stopped Thanos that sort of thing yeah and so Hulk and him could
join finally and maybe they did and we didn't see it because it was cut I mean
there's a there's that five-year gap which like it's not like it's impossible
we're not saying it couldn't happen it's just man it just sort of it's sort of
there and the movie says just sort of accept it and like it would have been
really nice I found like honestly I was I found a jarring seeing it in cinema I
was like oh wow okay that's we're doing that that's just that's happening at
least he dabs oh and yeah they really dragged out the take a photo with Ant-Man
joke for me I was like yeah that went on I get it yeah that was a bit much a lot
of the comedy was a bit too much in this movie yeah I'll try and remember them as
we go but like there was a there's a couple jokes that weren't working for me
while comparatively I thought Infinity War was one of the funniest of the MCU
films while being so one of the saddest sort of thing well they juggled him
really well in Infinity War yeah and then there's this this thing about you
know the MCU is terrible for ruining drama with comedy and I don't think it
applies to all of the MCU but it certainly applies to a lot of them or at
least specific jokes it's it's up and down sort of thing so yeah Hulk happened
and then there's Tony figures it out oh yeah so the the reconciling Tony and Cap
I wasn't happy with it yeah I didn't think you would be given how much you love
Civil War they have the scenes themselves but I feel like they kind of wasted it so my take is
Tony says and I'm paraphrasing some of the lines of like
it's not like being hateful is bad and I hate it it's like kind of a funny line
like to imply that he's he's tired of being mad at Cap and then they sort of move on I was like
oh god that's it I was like you need to fucking talk about Tony's dad you need to talk about
how Bucky like just one of you apologizes or they both do or they recognize what happened
and then they move on that's how you do that you just go real reconciliation between the two for
what happened yeah and I was I was really good about that because as yeah I love Civil War
it's like oh okay and then he's like here's the shield and he goes I don't know if I should have
it and he's like he made it for you and I was like did he I thought he just made the shield
because the shield was there in first of edge all right he picks it up he's like oh I'll have this
I guess and then I was talking like yeah I don't know that he made it for him but even that I'm
like man that's so thin but the movie that's got his own stuff to do I guess so it's just like ah
kind of kind of and there's a thing like it's not terrible it's just it could have been a lot
more and I figured they'd want to because I thought Civil War was like you know their baby
the Russo's like because Winter Soldier is directly leading into that and then Infinity War blah blah
blah blah and I still think Civil War is the best oh god yeah uh but it's it's it's tough I
er your favorite is Iron Man right yes and Iron Man one what is yours um probably Winter Soldier
I find loads of people pick Winter Soldier uh it's it's really tough between Iron Man
and Winter Soldier because they're both really good movies although I'd say objectively Iron Man
One has less issues than just that yeah I think uh Iron Man One's structure the only problem I
have with Iron Man One is Overdie goes insane at the end yeah the ending of Iron Man One kind of
falls apart I wish he had a reason so I mean this easily brings us into uh they go beat Thor
so Thor is now fat drinks beer and plays Fortnite oh my god the Fortnite shit um so
I just want to make it clear like as much as people like the memes don't fucking don't do
don't date your movie so hard with Fortnite wow master 69 called me a dick again that I mean I
cringed hearing that yeah that shit's funny maybe like 10 years ago for me like I'd be like huh
that's in the movie
and you know I still don't understand how the rest of the Asgardians managed to get half a ship to
earth like it doesn't really address that Captain Marvel pushed him yeah is that actually yeah
that's what I was talking about before I was complaining about I thought you were talking
about Iron Man and uh Nebula oh wait sorry what are you talking about yeah how the rest of the
Asgardians oh right uh yeah we as far as we know that just happened so yeah we know that they can
have a ship in there we know that they put out distress signals and the guardians found it so
it's possible that I mean Thor could have collected them with his automatic teleporter so
you know he has the he has what's it called uh why am I forgetting it the thing that lets you
travel instantly the bridge Rainbow Bridge thing in his weapon crossed that's the one I thought
that Wiggles was only a um something what's this fuck could do with the sword thing no Thor does
it with his hammer axe in Infinity Ward only oh yeah that's true I assume he could go get him
Heimdall that's who it was um oh yeah um I I think there's enough setup with like the distress
signal and the guardians finding it I could mostly believe it it would have been nice to have a line
for it though uh yeah so I'm I don't know how how much uh people how well people were thinking about
Thor exactly but like the only part of that scene that I started connecting to is when Hulk said
Thanos and Thor went quiet and I was like oh this is still serious I think because um I wasn't really
comfortable with laughing at Thor because I really appreciated his uh his portion in Infinity War
yeah he's had a he's had a rough history so like being like he's a fat loser more of a
redemption arc in this movie though because just keeping him like some fat loser for the entire
movie I didn't like it yeah and they keep making like fat jokes throughout the movie and I was like
guys okay look if you're gonna make him I wouldn't make him fat I would make him depressed sure make
him a uh give his beard like all disheveled grow out the hair be wearing clothes that are all like
you know uh wraggled and yeah wrinkled and long and just he just doesn't care and he's sort of
walking around his answers are all short but they make like a million jokes out of him and I was
like we're laughing at him I guess which I and why could he use his lightning powers to change
his beard style but not cut the weight I don't I don't know what to do I can't stand fat Thor
every time I saw him on screen I hated him I guess they keep it couldn't take him seriously
like for guardians I guess he's gonna be fat Thor and I don't know
well I guess I can finally cosplay as Thor now um yeah what do you think of Thor
oh I did not like him I like him did you have you ever liked him or uh and Thor one yeah sure
but really arc yeah I mean too arrogant humbled a bit became king
but then I don't know he just feels like he's gone off the rails ever since especially now
what do you think of um him in Ragnarok I haven't seen Ragnarok so I play
bit of inference have you seen the dark world I have but once so I don't did you love it
I did not love it damn well that's the best MCU movie oh easily uh so I just find that funny right
of all the places they could visit they visit the dark world called the duty it's like wow
I guess they're like they said yeah you know what fuck you this movie isn't the MCU
okay they didn't visit Hulk though I think they still want to pretend that didn't happen
um so yeah I don't know I guess we'll try and talk about more of it as we go through um
I liked the scene where Hawkeye is killing all the Asian men I thought it was cool it's purely
superficial I was actually a character for once yeah I did like that I did like Hawkeye and I
feel like this is I feel like him going like vigilante dark knight hero is something that
he would do yeah man he made it very clear he's like you guys don't deserve to have survived
wasn't a big fan of the mohawk though um I would have preferred they just kept it a little shorter
just lower yeah it's it's a bit it's it's up there it's up there yeah it's like his head has a
a fletching on it yeah he said the line's something like uh they got Thanos you get me
or something like that and I was like oh cool I like it make a movie for it this is go for it
um and yeah the actor who's uh fighting him this is the guy from last samurai isn't it
who uh the one who doesn't like tom cruise in the last samurai at first oh I don't remember his
name I don't remember his name as well but um yeah the whole thing was like a one shot too which
was pretty cool uh I liked I liked all of it Hawkeye is pretty awesome in this movie as far
as I'm concerned but we can talk more about that in a bit uh what happens next they're all
collecting up I think right oh yeah we're about to actually get to the part where they explain
fucking time travel because so what do you guys so Rocket is um working on whatever and Tony says
hey ratchet and he goes rocket do you think that was a reference to Ratchet and Clank or just
coincidence that's what I immediately thought but I was like oh that's kind of strange I don't think
so I don't think it was I don't think so either I think it was just a continuation of the column
other things yeah I think that I think so too but um I could see it like if if the director's
like yeah it was but it was a subtle reference I'd be like so subtle I didn't even think about
it myself I was gonna say if you wanted to make it more obvious you'd probably have Tony say
something like hey Ratchet was Clank something like that but that would be worse yeah let's see
that kind of ruins the joke also calling him build a bear yeah I remember that um which
yeah so did you guys love that uh every character in this movie basically shits on time travel
movies of the whole yeah real loved it yeah let's make fun of the time travel rules and other
movies while make our rules know better in some cases much worse um because
time travel is a weird one yes it's a weird one um
um I mean it I guess it makes sense in universe that they'd know about all this stuff and that
they would base what they think time travel is off of this stuff
but they hold these movies in high regard the characters hold the movies
you know in high regard yeah no uh it just the awkward inference you can make is like oh so you
guys think you're better than those films you guys think you make more sense than those films
I don't I don't know I don't think that's what the film is trying to say I think the film wants us
to throw them out don't think about them they're not what we're doing that sort of thing but it
does come across that way to a couple people I think because it was like fuck you because he
says Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit it's like hey um what are you is there any movie
you guys think functions really well with time travel overall because the one I usually suggest
is primer I haven't seen primer it's uh we'll check that out it's I think it's an indie movie
but it's a really um the whole film is trying to explore competent well-written time travel so it's
complicated but you know um I mean generally a lot of people say that Back to the Future is a really
good one I think I need to watch it again I've never really given it a huge amount of thought
as to whether or not Back to the Future makes complete sense because I always understood it
pretty simply right like it ripples through time yeah they say like there's branches in time
like when changes happen it creates a new timeline but you're talking about Avengers now right
uh Back to the Future did they do that in Back to the Future I thought it was just one timeline
with a buff biff when he gets older like that's its own timeline and they can go back before that
and head it off or yeah but that is from what I understand it is one timeline they go back change
something and it changes the future forever so they need to go back again and change that
pass back to make it so that their future comes true time travel this is the thing you start to
be like oh my brain and I know that there's gonna be a lot of people in chat who're gonna be able
to better look at it better explain it whatever but um we'll try our best to go through I liked
it when Don Cheadle talked about strangling a baby someone say predestination yeah that's
I haven't seen that that's a freaky one what's the best time travel movie you
best time travel movie I don't or story in general if you can think of anything well
stein's gate of course but you can animate uh well it's just just the best that's the truth of it
uh best movie though does I know this this might sound really weird but I think Titanfall 2 did
a good job with it I haven't played that whereas well in that there's a sequence where you essentially
can hop between it's almost like changing the level so instead of you it's almost like you're
a stranger popping in and out of different two different timelines and only the stuff that you
interact with changes at least from your own perspective um but I don't know I don't know
it's time travel yeah I enjoyed that level but I don't really understand how the time travel
and Titanfall 2 worked necessarily that's too back to the future I'm with Mahler I haven't seen
it in a long time so I don't remember if it works as well as I think it does or not
I think one of the reasons is because Titanfall I don't think they really explore
potential timeline changes they just stay with the one that they're on so that makes it seem
really simple but yeah but then your characters kind of replaced the guy whose memories you're
going through like he finds that dude stuck in the ceiling and then he kind of takes over doing the
same shit he did back in the past it's kind of weird it was a fun level but I genuinely
I'd probably have to play the campaign again it's been like a year or so but it's been a while for
the rule of thumb is like don't write time travel unless you're like folk that's your focal point
you're like I want to write about time travel it's like oh don't write off time travel it's a
big deal because really I mean that's like the biggest you can get yeah you can't you can't
really one-up time travel it's like the big last that was one of the reasons I hated that
fucking harry potter book so much because jk is just so flippant about time travel
like no this is the ultimate weapon and there is nothing greater
yeah there is nothing oh yeah her mind he uses it to get to different classes
like this is fucking time travel this is insane like no this girl uses it to get to classes
well there's people I believe we read a comment on one of the other efaps that apparently that's
very defensible I I wouldn't know because I haven't explored it but uh yeah just avoid
bringing it in because you know even if your time travel makes complete sense let's just say
it does um a majority of your audience is going to be like that didn't make sense because it's
so hard to follow sometimes when you have like a really complicated time travel system like
primer as a film is practically an invitation to those who want to explore how time travel can be
logically consistently written I I think so the issue is that when it comes to time travel we
don't like actually have time travel in this sense in our world so we don't really have like
set rules for it that we can compare to reality so it's almost like a bunch of hypotheticals and
theoreticals that different people have you know based on different interpretations of what it
might be and those all clash which is why setting up the rules for your time travel is so important
because like the way so the the standard paradox the standard time travel model is the grandfather
one right like the idea that you have a goal you complete it therefore that goal never needed to
be complete therefore you don't go but then therefore the goal happens blah blah blah blah
uh the way back to the future gets around it is to say that um changes in the past don't catch up
with the future straight away so you have the time to be able to yeah like that again I need
to watch it again before I mean if you have well yeah if you have the the tesseract in a box or
whatever or whatever and it's just sitting there and nobody interacts with it it doesn't make any
difference if it's it disappears from the box like Schrodinger's tesseract and then it's back
in the box before somebody else interacts with it in any way well so some people in chat are
suggesting time travel is potentially possible already depending on perspective like I believe
part of traveling at the light speed slows down either the viewer or the subject or the
yeah but we mean in the terms of movies like going back and interacting with previous events
the interesting thing is that they're not just traveling by time in the movie they're traveling
by space as well they're teleporting arguably arguably arguably uh and this is the thing it
starts to get like oh careful because now we need to like figure out exactly what the fuck they even
say for instance hulk says that that's that model of time travel is bullshit and he says it's
because if you travel uh to the past that past becomes your future and your former present
becomes the past which can't now be changed by your new future does that make sense
no fringy had so many problems with this um i was already lost i was like wait wait say that again
i'm i'm curious because i'm not familiar with stein's gate what are the general rules of the
time travel and there you are the general okay well there are parallel world lines or timelines
but they call them world lines and if you change one world line you're not you're basically not
changing that world line you're skipping over to another one where that change happened
so you can't have any paradoxes that way um the one like restraining factors that there's
this thing called attractor fields where world lines are like separated into bunches
that all have a certain convergence point that cannot be changed
it's it's complicated you'd have to watch it i mean it's hard uh i think i think that's what
we've layered easily from this is like if ever you had a model that does function for time travel
it's hard to break down and understand perfectly yeah um yeah i'm just gonna say it again because
there's a lot of people in chat who said what the fuck so he says if you travel to the past
let's just try and go through if you travel to the past meaning they go to 2012 for example
he says that past becomes your future i assume he's saying that if you were to stay there
that would now be your timeline i don't really know because i don't know what he's referencing
as the past and the future in this complicated sentence i wonder if he would replace like you
would replace your old version from that past or if there would just be two because if you travel
to the past that past becomes your future and your former present becomes the past which can't
now be changed by your new future i assume we know from the movie you don't replace your old self
no no i didn't know if it was like a back to the future kind of thing where you steadily like
fade away depending on what you do well uh so going from what he says right so if you've got
my stream up i'm going to show you my amazing picture so we can try and discuss this and i will
try and look at chat as best i can to to catch anybody who's making explanations that i'm monitoring
it so make it make sense so as you can see from my incredible drawing timeline one and don't worry
we'll try and pick this apart timeline one is is the movie now just before the end of timeline one
there's three travels to different i assume judging from oracle lady ancient one whatever
you go to the past and you do a thing that never happened in that past you have thus created you've
just split off a new reality a new timeline i don't jeez he says to her that we can fix your reality
that's what he says to her in the film and i was like your reality as in two separate realities
as in are we talking parallel universes here like it would create a new basically timeline
for all the things that they interacted with but they would go back to their own you're right so
so according to the movie uh we have three teams they go to two three and four cap uh no ironman
and antman fuck up to the point where cap and antman cap and ironman have to go to universe five
and then they collect all the stones and bring them back to universe one there's other things
to talk about we're just going to run with this for a second then the film ends with cap going to
replace all of them and he ends up on a bench as an old man now a lot of people are simultaneously
upset and happy with it because we're not sure if it makes any sense now the explanation i've heard
is that it turns out we were watching universe one when there is in fact a universe zero which was
the actual original mcu timeline where cap did all of this and then traveled to universe one
had sat on the bench because that was and he was secretly married to peggy carter
and he did all of his stuff and he just probably changed his name and stayed under the radar
while our cap was doing anything yeah that's what i imagine he would have to do because he
he would know that he's out there frozen and they'll find him um so he can't disrupt that
so before we can start picking everything apart because that's totally possible
any thoughts just off the top of your head from looking at this model fuck it
uh weird line from ancient one she says something along the lines of like when you knock out a stone
she's she she puts out the time stone specifically but she says a stone
then you create a darker timeline as if to imply you don't get a new timeline unless you do something
with stones specifically um and a lot of people have taken that as word of god sort of thing to
do with the script i don't think you could say that's true because what if i went back
and killed tony stark i didn't touch any stones i just killed tony stark
wouldn't that have to change the timeline and thus create a new timeline like or erase timeline one
because he's no longer alive to be in the end of timeline one so that none of that can even happen
anymore why do they even need all of the infinity stones when they can just once they get the time
stone like what are the time stones powers exactly that's one of the issues i have is they never
actually use any of the powers of any individual stone in the movie yeah like you have the time
stone that controls time oh do you mean like you're golden now they should just fly out to
outside of earth with the time stone or they're just rewind the thing by five years well what's
the what's the freaking rules of the time stone no idea this part of what broke dr strange because
to me i'd be like we have to do time travel it's like all right well let's go get the time stone
that's the one that matters and the rest well we can just we have the time stone
so we have like an info just like in dr strange we have an infinite amount of attempts to get them
which means if it's possible that we get if it's even possible that we can get them
then it's inevitable that we'll get them
um time so not just that but i don't know about you guys but if you were with the avengers and
you're like all right you need all six stones where were they at what times what are the easiest
ways to sort of grab them i would have been like oh i know one if i was iron man i'd be like um
there was this purple dude who had like this gauntlet with most of them in it already if we
if we go back to when you guys subdued him and literally just fucking knock out peter quill
we can get the gauntlet off him and tell the avengers well we could just kill him there and
then because he was knocked out by thingy so we can literally chop off his head with thought
because we know that's possible done and done that universe doesn't even have a Thanos now and
then we'd be like hey universe uh we just saved your ass hardcore do you mind if we take the other
stones um and we'll come right back but we need to save our universe too we need to save them
yeah that would have been that may then that would have ruined the film so you can't do that
also oh damn we can't do much time traveling we're restricted because we have such limited
dim particles it's like oh well i guess they can't get anymore oh no they can they just need
to travel back in time it's like why didn't you do that first also how come he only grabbed like
four of them instead of all of them yeah that was weird i was like no no all of them they're all
extremely valuable get all of them fucking hag pimp can make more just take them all yes it's
like we need these well you could literally put them in his thing and go back just before cap
entered that room and then there will be there again and grab the mole and see that other cap
and be like fuck you just leave again well that's the thing it's it's the whole well you can have
anything particles yeah you just keep going back five minutes before you grabbed them the first time
and and that makes it so you're making now you're making things really awkward for
a bunch of other timelines in which you did this but yeah which is another issue is do
they care about the repercussions in the other timelines did how did cap fix what they did with
loki i'm assuming he didn't how did cap you know what they took the spear the um the staff the
whatever it is the loki spear they took the stone out of that did they put it back in before they
replaced it because age of ultron is a very different movie if you don't even have that
scepter as it is um no mind controlling as well for age of ultron which happens to a
the girl uh the doctor girl she allows a ultron to do everything she needs her to do so like yeah
again like this is like um uh oh time travel is really weird uh and yeah this is why it's really
it's messy there's there's no yeah it's the it's the big thing it's the it should not be treated
lightly and the overall there's a few more so like uh why did they choose do you guys remember
guardians of the galaxy so quill gets the um power stone and he's like immediately ambushed by
ronan's men where were they in this movie they don't turn up they don't i was like hmm well i
guess compared to when they punch him well if you remember uh what's her name gamora uh nebula got
knocked out she was on the floor for a while there's no way they wouldn't have turned up
well speaking of nebula how is it that she can be connected to the other nebula from the other
timeline oh it's it's it's explained in guardians it's called convenience i don't know i'm i'm okay
i'm okay with that part i'm not um i would have been i mean if not for the fact that she should
be fully aware of that and she jeopardizes the whole mission by going just let war machine go
without you i mean i could understand like her not foreseeing that um but wouldn't she start
having the same because the other the past nebula started having some fuckery going on in her head
but president nebula didn't well president that's so you're nearly there she does eventually my
problem is why doesn't it happen at the same time well isn't it because don't they have um
the thanos's machine that reads the memories no no it first happens to her when she's just talking
to thanos remember and thanos is like what the fuck is this and she she displays all that stuff
and it's like uh shouldn't our our one be like also she has that issue the second after war
machine leaves very very very convenient timing and not even really the second after it's like
the second that they're both pressing the button and about to press the button and you might be
like uh well yeah you know she's just unlucky and it's like um why doesn't she just she's like oh
no thanos knows and it's like okay so what's the problem and it'd be like oh it's gonna change how
thanos behaves in this universe i guess like okay that's yeah that's it enough shit you're gonna
have to move on because you need to go back now just just activate a little thing and go back
instead she decides to get herself captured and provide them with a pimp particle like um okay
that's interesting like why didn't you know when she's getting sucked up into the ship i was like
use your thing you use the thing go back what are you doing and she just lets herself get captured
i don't know why um yeah that was dumb the thaws thaws timeline where he just goes and gets the uh
the juice that worked out just fine mostly because the logic of the film i'm assuming
i could be getting this wrong is that if you return the stone the timeline goes back to normal
as it was always supposed to yeah i i i'm okay with that given a certain amount of margin of error
like you know the tests are acting in and out of the box if no one's there to interact with it or
if nobody's actions are influenced by it then i'm i could see how the timeline would quote unquote
mend itself um but that's one of those every situation is kind of its own kind of its own
deal it's very contextual whether it would or not i mean it depends on how big the change is
yeah like if there's something we're missing by the way time travel wise it could very well
be the case like are you guys all three of you are you following along or is there anything
that we do you think we've missed here because i thought this is pretty much how they do it in the
film yeah i'm a little confused so what exactly leads you to believe that there are actually
multiple timelines uh ancient ones saying that when you take a stone out it makes a new timeline
and then they have to go back to that specific timeline and repair it quote unquote right but
before you're also kind of assuming there's multiple timelines before they remove the stones
oh uh is as a result of moving the stones that the timelines are made i'm assuming
so i just put them there ahead of time but the whole deal is that they put them back so that there
aren't multiple timelines yes so technically as far as i'm aware well so this is the other problem
if we go by ancient ones logic then you only get a new timeline when you take a stone out
but my question is what is happening then if i Thanos is dead in timeline four
so doesn't that change everything the timeline four to the point where it can't be timeline one
um yeah it would it has to be a new one because one of the because like the first thing that
somebody mentions is um let's go back in time and kill baby Thanos right and then banner says
that wouldn't change anything for us it would for their timeline though right yeah hmm i mean
that sounds logical but i don't think the movie ever really puts that forward
well then i think they don't i think they don't do it because banner says that it wouldn't change
it for us um and depending on how many timelines there were i mean there's potentially i guess by
the rule the avengers rules there's only a timeline for how many stones there could be
is that what the ancient one is kind of leading at here although the reason is just the time stone
because she picks that one out specifically to clarify for chat the reason i've drawn it this way
is because it's much easier to understand than if i drew a line and then lines going back to them
and then splitting off depending on the events that happen but yeah these timelines only exist
when they fuck them up as far as i can tell from the movie they slot back in with timeline one
timeline one if everything goes to plan but then you have the problem of well hey
so moving a stone makes a new timeline okay killing tony stark or thanos or someone like
that surely that makes two timelines go okay what about giving tony stark cardiac arrest
that would probably change at least a few things right and then you get to the point of what about
opening a door on some street where it wasn't before you know the whole butterfly effect idea
um are there an infinite amount of timelines for every potential change that could ever possibly
happen yeah
so yeah like the like the infinite timeline thing is one of it's it's why bioshock infinite doesn't
make sense fuck that game uh so yeah i um i don't get it uh is the short version of this and from
what i can tell if i was to be getting it is that it doesn't really make sense is everybody on that
page i'm fine with yeah at this point with me in time travel it's almost like uh give me a few
rules to work by that are big ones and then where it might be the best you could do
because there's always going to be an element of we couldn't possibly know or
what really happens in some scenario again so to clarify so uh superapm said that's not what she
suggested obviously changing anything regardless of the stones will split the time stream it's just
that if they took the stones then her uh timeline would be left defenseless yeah check online loads
of people interpret it as there's only a new timeline if you knock out a stone which i think
makes no sense uh so if we treat it as there's always a new timeline even if you change
relatively small things uh the film doesn't work either way kind of the point but i agree
that you can't take the time stone away from the daughter of supreme before they fight dole
mom that's not gonna fucking work is it yeah but i think that um i think it's i do think
from what someone in chat said it's fair to say that they did create a lot of new timelines in
this movie yeah i think so yeah which is almost like it makes you think are they going to use
one of those potential timelines to be the timeline that the mcu carries on in you don't
know that's the thing i mean it's always like their back doors there one of those timelines
is the one that because it's those characters doing those things and a lot of this stuff happens
it's a way for them to legitimately by their own rules at least or what they present as their own
rules offer a potential continuity that doesn't get mixed up too much in the events of infinity
war and in-game you go but the line you don't understand from the movie probably means you
can't travel to your own past only to a parallel timeline again i maybe i don't really know i'm
not really sure i think there's a lot of people trying to figure out exactly what happens in the
film based on what people say and what we see um and this encompasses what you would call the
second act by the way and a lot of people are very uh split on whether or not the second act
was any good um what do you what do you guys take on it as a whole basically all the time traveling
it really fucked up the movie for me yeah sam i'm it didn't fuck up the movie for me
me but i don't know i mean i'm i'm i'm in the middle on it uh
it's it's i mean time travels just it's weird it's a weird one i like you really have to
plan that out well beforehand you can't just introduce it at the fucking very end of the
series and then there's i don't think anyone can deny so that there's going to be discussions and
arguments about whether or not the time travel makes sense but i don't think anyone's denying
the um their choices where they go back in time is stupid compared to what they could have done
someone a chat is saying am i missing something what about loki scepter not working in the
avengers on tony stark and loki being surprised by it what do you mean that's i'm just reading the
comment plus yeah because tony's like got a metal thing on it that's not connected to his
in i guess that's that's avengers that's not even this movie
but i think that's it i think it's enough time travel talk yeah sure i so much resolution
so i liked uh seeing all the things in a very superficial way but uh i knew watching it i was
like oh man this is going to be talked about for so long for how like this is fucked up or this is
complete uh sensical writing i've already seen passionate takes on both every side of the
argument there's people out there who are like this is the best time travel movie that exists
and then there's people who are like this has ruined the mcu so if ever i was to make a video
about that specifically i'd have to fucking look into this for ages because it's like
so many factors and assumptions you have to make um i like that they showed the ancient one actually
attacking shit during the year 2012 because i was actually wondering where the fuck they were
during that um so that was neat oh that's something so why didn't the ancient one
know that hulk was gonna walk up to her if she's looked into the future a billion times in her
reality if you know what i mean because i didn't even think about it some people have said like
well because that wasn't going to happen until he chose to do it i don't know you know i mean like
this is a problem with time travel it's like well i guess with when it comes to
maybe it's because um she could only see so far and hulk exit the the the point where hulk comes
back that decision was made in a point that she couldn't see past
because like we all agree right she's surprised to see him or surprised to deal with him
she's like it's not like surprised to learn about uh dr strange well no she knew about dr
strange just was surprised to find yeah that was it he has to argue why she has to give him the
stone so she clearly didn't know this was going to happen because she wouldn't have done that
she'd have been like here's that would actually have been pretty cool if he turned up and she said
here's the stone he's like that easy huh and she goes just take it should have been like oh she's
aware of what's going to happen i guess but um someone said she couldn't see past her death
this is five years before she died well i'm saying that the point where hulk decides to
use time travel to come back was a decision that was made after the point where she could see
so she wouldn't see the repercussion of that decision being made
you which makes sense why she wouldn't know that dr strange would give the stone to thanos
because that's after she that's fine with me because that happens in a different reality
from what i understand travel but why can't she see in her own reality that the hulk came in
because i don't think that was a even a potential reality until hulk makes that decision
and the setup for like basically the prerequisite for that reality didn't happen until a point after
she could see so all of the potential realities that existed yet because not everything's possible
right so like like the time stone is unaware of this even being a thing in a way like um maybe
maybe the time stone only and we're getting a little bit hypothetical here because the extent
of the time stones capabilities aren't exactly known in full but what about it's possible uh
what about the idea that she could then as he tells her all this she could be like oh give me
a sec and she looks into the future again just to see how everything turns out or would that still
not make sense i guess i guess if uh the hulk the hulk is the basically the prerequisite requirement
that allows for the current reality to even become possible at all so that means that when
the hulk does come back this new simply that basically branches the timeline off where she is
and that makes her that makes the time stone at least aware that there's a new reality now
or a new timeline that it can um that it can see because of it maybe i don't know i'm getting
hypothetic i'm getting hypothetical but yeah yeah no i think i think we'll only be hypothetical
like the things we say in this stream are probably going to be outdated even by tomorrow
like who knows because this is a really complicated discussion um i just saw someone in chat say that uh
doesn't see different branches someone in the chat said the infinity war in endgame take place after
dr strange which is after her death and she can't see past her death it's like but i'm talking about
from her perspective in her reality um and i guess that's why i'm thinking that limestone
only allows her to see the branches that exist that are that have the potential to exist because
before during her lifetime the the the potential branch where the hulk comes back it doesn't exist
yet it's not even possible yet it will only become possible after the hulk you know initiates that
event also for clarifications for people who are saying you didn't say that only a stone would do
i'm pretty sure she like word for word says if you take a stone it'll create a branch that uh
may benefit your reality like you your reality would be benefited but i always will not
or something like that like um yeah she does make it sound like what i was saying but again i don't
know if someone pointed out dr strange does see past his death huh so that is an issue
yeah
i'm not even sure i'm travel i don't even really understand you know him looking into the future
like what if he sees the 14 million potential he sees the one that works how can he do anything
to make that reality work outside of signaling to tony stark that he needs to kill himself
do you know what i mean like what else could dr strange even affect um that he wasn't going to
pretty much do anyway like bringing people into the fight you know like it wasn't like maybe that
one well of all the realities that didn't work of all the potentials that didn't work we saw the one
that did how far well who who knows how far along those potentials got before they failed
like how many of those potentials involve the events of endgame playing out as they did
until something didn't happen is that the point that we just all that happened was we saw the one
that won but there was shit tons that didn't i assume so yeah yeah okay i thought that's what
i thought that's what we're supposed to be gleaned by i'll i'll settle for that for now because i
mean fucking hell this is uh like it'll just go on forever probably uh i liked the scene with
thor and his mom i really like that scene i like the message of it and it makes me think about
thor as a whole being that um the problem is ragnarok essentially says thor has finally become
the leader the king the man he was supposed to be and this film says he was never really that
that may have been who he's supposed to be but that's never who he wanted to be or who he is
so thoughts um
um well i was i don't know thor has always
that i don't have like an issue i don't think it undermines thor by not being king
um instead he's much more of the the free-spirited adventurous type but he doesn't
you know abandon things in an irresponsible way
um i guess it's thor's that's like the way of having thor like break with what his destiny
was supposed to be that he didn't want and it implies you know a level of control that we have
over our futures um
um what do you think uh i was just gonna say because you sound you sound probably most against
it i just don't understand the point of it i don't know what they were trying to go for
um it seems to be that they're saying that thor is actually just a fun loving dude
rather than an important okay i mean it does seem to undermine the at least the first movie for me
i mean because that's kind of what he was and that's what he needed to kind of change
to grow from that but now he can just you know toss it aside let this lady who i didn't even
know because i didn't want ragnarok be king yeah i just didn't really match up for me yeah and
ragnarok was kind of a retcon of his character that's everything before that true but not in the
in the arc of becoming king sort of thing i feel like ragnarok was yeah yeah yeah sure um so yeah
this is the thing i i've even said to fringy before like i'm undecided on thor i really like thor
um but i'm not sure what i think about them doing this to him uh yeah i'm a little like i don't have
like a huge problem with it but i i did expect for him to like sort of like lead you know like be
basically like the mayor of asgard or whatever it is that's kind of what i expected um um but i
don't know what we got isn't i don't think it's bad do you think that this happened because they
wanted to make him um jump into the guardians franchise and he can't do that if he's king of
asgard i think so i think that's a part of it yeah seem like that way because i think that
would explain it right because this is the thing i um i think everyone would agree there's so many
like video essays out there that talk about how his arc is you know becoming the man he was always
meant to be this movie kind of just says nah you're like oh i heard from a lot of people saying that
they made him fat and kind of worthless to nerf him against Thanos i don't know how accurate that
is if you were to ask the same question to the rusos but i i really didn't like what they did
with him in this movie and we'll get to that because i actually feel like he was really fucking
nerfed well uh but yeah uh i'd probably say i'm i'm inching towards not happy versus happy and it's
i think it's mainly because of how i really got a sense of Thor being invested very much so in his
people and leading them yeah especially by the end of Ragnarok and this movie's kind of like nah
you'll leave it to the girl like oh wow he's just oh okay that one that thing i didn't really i
wasn't really like i liked valkyrie but i'm like oh just like that huh and i feel like you just
need loads of tweaks if you really want to run with that like you you need that scene where she
goes you know Thor uh a fight another fight broke out in in the whatever council meetings
for the whole society that's going on there and he's just like doesn't care and then she's like
and uh our supplies i'll take yeah our supplies are running low people are losing faith and he's
just like can't you take care of it and then just leaves or something because he's depressed and
then she does and you'd be like oh okay at least but the film's just like she's a great leader you're
like oh okay i i don't recall seeing this yeah that was uh what i would call rushed i assume
you guys would agree is also where did she get the pegasus from pegasus land
that's true that's true i don't remember her having that and
or she didn't have it in that flashback in rack yeah yeah but you don't have it no more
is there like a is there do they there's new asgard farm pegasus
pegasi like wakanda farms rhinos yeah possibly or like how fanos farms weird purple
grape things the first time weird grape would be valid uh the i thought it was weird that when
they port the black panther people in there's like a huge army and i was like weren't all of
them killed in the fight not the dust and even if there was bringing back the dusted people
in infinity war they're like oh we don't have that many people because the border tribe didn't join
us because the events of black panther so i was like where'd you get all these people from
and why shiri on the front lines yeah we're gonna get to that so uh yeah so the stupid nebula thing
allows thanos old thanos to come into the picture um i don't know like so rags you
didn't seem to have much of a problem with it i consider it super contrived um i'll say it's
extremely i mean i i can definitely see that there's a problem with it and you might be like
well what else would they do and i'd be like i don't think we should judge it well what else they
can do i don't know they're i'm sure they could come up with something that's the thing like
surely they could have come up with something um maybe if nebula's maybe a lot of it is based off
of how nebula the current nebula kind of like treats it and acts about it you know like why
didn't she you know war bank of time during the you know why she's getting pulled into the spaceship
and stuff like that you get like so if you were here the and you realize oh no thanos knows all
the plan my first concern is damn this universe is going to get thanos earlier than normal but i
gotta go because you know what i mean like we're going to replace all the stones he's going to try
and collect them endgame is going to happen for this universe much faster than it did for hours
i guess question mark is again i don't even fucking clearly understand exactly what is going
on with the universe is uh being split exactly but you know i mean like when when thanos uses
the pimp particle that he gets he leaves his own timeline so does that timeline even
get thanos at all well because he does after though that's after i'm just talking about in
that moment uh why she i don't know why she made her decisions like that she actually calls hulk
eye i think she says like clint thanos knows and i'm just like what do you expect him to do exactly
if the call went through if he picked it up he's like okay we're gonna get the stone and leave
still do you know i mean i don't really understand what what the decisions are i'm just like okay
that's happening now and like i said she could have teleported at any moment from the point of
finding that out to the point of getting captured and she just doesn't and it just bugged me um so
what if they went to where the soul stone was and they just hid and then before thanos could throw
gamora down the pit like hawkeye just shot her with an arrow that creates a new timeline that
doesn't solve their problem i guess hooray uh what the fuck was because then he could still
chuck uh black widow down the hole and he could get the soul stone
why bother with okay what if he's going to do that anyway then why bother with
i don't know fuck it so anyway what was with uh ant man and iron man's plan uh to get the tesser
act what was that that that hardcore took me out of the movie when i realized their plan was
ant man sneak inside tony's harp thing and give him cardiac arrest and then kick me the briefcase
and i'll leave with it i was like is that all you guys came up with are you kidding me
yeah why didn't they just go to where it was being stored and they had to wait wait for
it to go in a car um or whatever i'm assuming what a place to steal it i guess the problem is
that thor is holding the briefcase and he's going to take it back to asgard like okay so we know
that he has to go to the avengers compound according to avengers before he actually leaves
so crazy idea what have you actually like tried to reason with thor even or uh tell them that this
is really important like the idea that they had to do it here the gas everybody create a huge
it's so lucky that uh nobody cares that the briefcase with the tesser act gets
kicked across the floor you know what i mean outside of loki for some reason
i was just like what a crazy plan definitely not a good time and place to have your little heist
is in the lobby with everybody there and all these people and you know the shield fed guys
as marthyn just suggested why not just go to 1970 to begin with
i gotta go back send cap and iron man to that one thor hulk can get the uh the time stone
i mean fuck the time stone probably existed in 1970 thinking about it yeah i did like the
little um i did like i didn't like the captain america hail hydro thing oh that was awesome
i thought that was actually clever too i thought that was clever um also yeah hulk happening to
him and and calls all this problem i was just like oh god there's so many many conveniences and
inconveniences this film's stacking a ball up it's like hulk happened to open the door the
moment toady was trying to open it really okay that's fine this was another half an hour of the
film to happen um i think what else happens it's like he fights himself that was cool
everybody thought that was okay i thought that was fine yeah it makes sense that capped old cap
would think that it's loki yeah and the fact that he says um i could do this all day that he's like
yeah i know i did i did like that i really did like that how do you how do you feel about that
yeah i mean well if we're going with this interpretation if there are multiple timelines
then yeah it's fine yeah it was fun i mean i'm assuming that timeline is permanently
fucked because loki escaped with the the tesseract right yeah i don't know what happens now
so i like the idea of change it's not fucked but it's changed right we don't know how so
who knows what exactly will happen as a result of that because this is this is a pre-ragnarok loki
do you like um he said that is america's ass i thought it was funny you thought it was what
funny i thought it was funny oh it's also a point out quote unquote connection by the way
what do you guys think about this it's like oh when i man flicked ad man onto toady uh that's a
reference to the fact he's played that flicking game at the beginning of the film i was like uh
i guess i don't think no i don't know if that's a connection i don't i is there is every flicking
thing that he does after that point or call back to when he played the flicking game it is the
flicking game a call back to when he flicked things earlier like no you could just oh
people flick every step he takes every step he takes is a call back to a previous step that he
i think that's it for act two i'm trying to think if this was anything else before
it hits the fan um um oh the the scene where it happened yeah i was about to say um i really
really really liked tony interacting with his dad yeah i thought that was amazing uh the only thing
is like the security for the tester act he can just rake it out of that box and there's no alarms
or anything it's like okay relax all you needed is him to be like friday disable you know alarms
like oh there you go fine but yeah captain uh cat america seeing margaret yes which will
nicely set up the finale i was oh yeah um but i think that tony talking with his dad was really
something else yeah i have to appreciate robert giant junior is like he seems stressed and like
unable to actually put into words what the fuck to say and it's just like that's how it should be
because his dad is probably the only person that can turn him into a kid it was really good i really
liked it i really liked it um then yeah they get the stuff and oh i think oh and one thing i'm glad
they didn't do what you what do you think we should call him he's like uh tony
yeah that would have been they didn't they didn't take it too far
it's like tony names himself he's like okay they knew when to start you know they knew not to go
too far with it uh so yeah following up from that um the scene in which black widow dies
yeah why don't you go with that first that was the best scene by far loved it everything about it
i'm assuming you love specifically that she died uh yeah that's a huge part of it um so to clarify
i'm assuming you don't like her or i'm not her biggest fan i have to say i mean uh of the female
characters the fcu is there one that is actually better developed than she is at this point i'm
trying to think of like who i would even say captain marvel of course oh i think i think
that's why it works well this is the thing i don't know if i'm going to be taking the
the weird road here but i actually really like that scene like i really did no i i liked it yeah
i liked them i like that scene i like the idea of them fighting over it as soon as the scene
took them there i was like yeah they're gonna have to try and i thought they were gonna take
it to the degree where they nearly kill each other because that's what you'd need to get one
of them to be able to sacrifice themselves while the other one's still alive it's like because
those two as much as we don't get a lot of it they've been pretty consistent across the mcu being
like best buds yeah and they set up earlier for black widow that basically the only family and
everything she has is the avengers yeah and so she kills herself and i thought it was great you know
hawkeye does have like the family and everything he's trying to save and i feel bad about this
because i keep criticizing this film over and over again but i have to uh what was with them using
the same soundtrack and shot for gamora's death for black widow's death yeah it seemed really
lazy i wouldn't i wouldn't even i'd say like distasteful not lazy i think it's like what the
hell are you doing that was gamora's death now you've made it gamora and black widow's death
which is odd i think what they were maybe not so much the shot i was okay with the shot i was
more so bothered that they used the exact same score music yeah i think what they were trying
to do was create a very direct parallel yeah but i think it was not a good idea
like they should be distinct yeah i feel like they need to be separated because those two
characters deaths are both quite impactful they're they're completely different characters you
shouldn't and they died for different reasons and now you've made it so the death the exact same
but yeah i just thought it was weird i was like why did you do that that made it weird uh but i love
the whole way they do it though and then how when they come back and they're all like happy
and then hawkeye just goes on his knees i was like uh yeah and that kills act two finally so there
we go like a lot of people i've actually seen a lot of the takes be like act one's okay act two
is crap act three is where it's good that sort of thing is that kind of how you feel wolf or
uh not so much yeah there were there were parts of act two that i liked but it was mostly just
the character stuff the plot is a fucking awful mess but yeah i'd say the movie for me like what
i came out of it remembering the most was the third act yeah i think i think act two was one
of those the plots like but the character stuff was really good for the most part okay so there's
a lot of things still so like they just make a gauntlet that can hold the stones out of yeah
um that was always one of those and good thing that uh uh iron man made it so that the gauntlet
could resize itself so yeah they didn't decide who was going to wear it until hulk was like i'll do
it i guess the idea of nanomachines but i'm just stuck at like how the fuck does earth material do
this i thought it was the whole point was like super amazing metal melted by a dying star directly
like that's that seems pretty powerful stuff and it makes sense that that's what the gauntlet can be
made by was like no i can make one you're like oh yeah it's almost like you're expecting for
there to be a whole scene about them acquiring a gauntlet of some kind you know which would be cool
or or sneak or one of the things that they would need to do is sneak back in time to get a gauntlet
from another timeline or do something different from a gauntlet does it necessarily need to be a
gauntlet does it have to be finger snapping i mean i genuinely don't know if this is a rule
that you need to have a gauntlet i don't know about it but yeah it seems i don't know why they
would just do the exact same thing i liked it when they pulled the gems in and rocket went boom
uh i like rocket a lot rocket's awesome it's kind of interesting that
the idea like they're you know in the writer's room they're just like okay most of the guardians
die except one let's keep uh rocket it's just like wow that casual choice we could have had
drags throughout the two movies you know oh well one movie we could have had well not camora could
have had peter you know it just the idea that you um casually just chose rocket to me and i'm just
like oh i liked him a lot so it was good but it's just interesting how that happens um
um yeah so it seemed seemed really fucking convenient that you could just make a gauntlet
like that but okay then they have to decide who's going to use it and um this part upsets me i don't
know how you guys feel about it but when thor is like slowly breaking down because he's like
i fucked up i need to fix it i need to be the one that does this because it's like important to me
that sort of thing and then they just throw a cheese whiz joke in the middle of it
yeah that that was again the problem with the comedy is it really undercut a lot of the
like serious moments of this movie i remember specifically not laughing at the cheese whiz
i was annoyed i was like let thor carry on please shut the fuck up
like he's a god wouldn't he be the safest bet well see this is kind of i wish they'd establish this
but i always assumed that it was more than just physical physical is important but that it's also
important but that it's also an element of will character heart willpower sure but again we're
talking about a god no of course and so when when tony says like you know you know and he's trying to
bring him down and be like you're just not you're not all together you're not all there you don't
you can't do this sort of thing like i took it as mentally he's just unsuitable and it makes sense
to me the hulk would do it especially they have that little explanation where they're just like
it's gamma so it's something that he should be able to put up with those like okay um but yeah i
don't know i felt like they damaged that scene with a retarded joke it would have been really
nice to see thor do it yeah um and you could even have killed him for it which would have been
something very interesting i'm not sure how that would have changed the film and uh everything
resulting um and then okay so this is a genuine question how um how is it that you have a pin
particle and it thus allows thanos to move his entire ship and army through to the machine
how does that work and and when he brings it through the machine how come it teleports way
way way up instead of destroying the building with its presence i suppose neville could have
been like make sure to propel up the second that you come through whatever i'm just still stuck at
how that even makes any sense i don't know maybe i don't know do they find a way to interface it
with their ship or fuck i don't know and yeah okay so some people have already said it in chat
but some people are saying it online as well it makes sense because he would have the smartest
like scientist wicket and i'm just sitting there like i'm sorry hank pym had to invent the thing
for them to be able to use it are you kidding me like you understand how bullshit this is right
yeah that's pretty bullshit yeah that's bullshit um and yeah so i'm just saying logistically now
let's assume they know how to use it logistically these characters need to put a suit around them
then put a pin particle into like their waist or whatever and it allows them to travel so where is
thanas put in this pin particle can you speak you okay in the microwave in the microwave oh wait
you never put a pin part of the microwave uh kf wait maybe i got this wrong kf kh fan said nebula
carried the shrunken ship it grew out of the uh the compound is that true i thought she pulled
them through the uh the the time thing i thought that was a joke that the whole carrying the ship
thing since you know the whole captain marvel carrying the ship i thought that the comment
was a joke oh well i don't know is that what happened i don't know yeah i mean i i only
remember it just coming from the teleporter and then shooting up i thought that it came through
from uh the past or the other dimension is it that she actually carried it in her hand
i i don't know i'll have to watch the movie yeah i don't know but that would make far more sense
that would make way more sense to me yeah oh yeah if that's if that's what it is yeah that's way
better case and okay we've seen this setup before so all right i'm down with it um how'd she shrink
it well with the pin particle but uh but how do you do that like you know those you know those
discs ant-man has they don't have those they just
help us chat help us understand some of this movie's strangeness
um hmm yeah so um meek alton said you can clearly see the ship going through the quantum realm
does that mean we didn't see her put it onto the platform or anything though we just see her
accessing the yeah she put the wire shit in the fucking thing and then activated the thingy and
i remember you have the fucking movie pulled up don't you um i'll have a look now it comes through
the portal i thought it comes through the portal like normal and then like almost instantly it
zooms upward yeah i don't know now i feel like chat is civil warring itself like everyone's got
a different idea of what exactly happened they traveled through time she didn't shrink it they
used thanos's chin see i that's probably true just add water nebula does not carry the shit
she calls it and crashes through the roof see why can't every single one of you four
thousand nine hundred forty four people agree with each other it makes it so difficult when
everyone's not the borg why can't you just have one idea guys jesus um all right well
i think this problem's either way so let's just just move on i guess because it's just like yeah
that's a thing that happened a friend of mine thought it was super convenient that none of
the avengers died in the explosion what do you guys think about it yeah especially antman yeah
i mean i mean of all people it blew up literally inches from i thought that was um gonna be his
death scene yeah i thought that would be too but i guess he used his little tiny thingy
what that make him more susceptible to dying if he made himself i don't know
i don't know maybe that would keep him more stable i'm not sure but i guess they're i guess
they use that as the explanation for how he survived yeah because they just show him small
i think they can't they didn't want to kill many people i imagine before the end shot because they
wanted to have as many heroes together at once right but it's just like hmm i think someone
probably should have died in that explosion just to give it another sense of like oh god you know
like this is it was definitely an intense barrage by what they showed i mean i mean they blew up
literally the entire area yeah yeah they were serious about it yeah yeah yeah because like
it um it the post explosion is almost like a desolate wasteland it's like fuck like a mushroom
cloud uh which i thought was really weird but it i guess it's gonna recover from that it's like okay
okay someone pointed out hawkeye of all out of all of them probably would have been the one that died
yeah at least yeah he doesn't exactly have a super come down right in front of him
um this is everywhere i think that yeah ant one definitely came down right in front of antman i
don't remember if one came down right in front of hawkeye but either way somebody should have died
possibly no that that was antman oh yeah that was oh that was antman yeah i thought it was interesting
that all right there was enough damage that war machine had to get out of his suit but everyone
else managed to you know you know i mean like it's enough damage that the war machine suit is
blown open well he has to take it off it's just like oh wow but everyone else seemed to know
whatever is fine uh which brings us to the the uh i guess what would you what does anyone want
to talk about i guess it would be the fighting thanos as um the three main dudes right um all right
okay um or got thor got nerfed but he was fat does that mean that he is now
fat well he's i guess his body muscle ratio is off of it um well let me ask you how do you feel
about captain america and me all near uh oh well you know let's save that for a second um because
we get thanos immediately so a lot of people feel like thanos has been screwed over in this film
he's not the same thanos so the vengeful nature he has at the end doesn't make as much sense
if it was the same one yeah do you guys feel like it's inconsistent yeah i mean i understand
why it's like that but i don't like it it makes the impact not quite as
impactful i guess i probably could have worded that better um go ahead i mean he's a
why would he have that personal stake in it maybe it's because he's seen the future the the future
that these people have done to him well i think i think there's a valid explanation i'm just not
sure that it's what it's what was wanted because you can go loads of ways with it right you can
you can take all kinds of directions with what you want to do with thanos but a lot of people
are arguing like oh well we're seeing a younger thanos a more angry thanosa um one that has been
screwed over as well he's seen his plan completed and then subverted which would enrage him more
than likely so does it make sense that he is a basically a psychopath in this one versus the
sort of arm and i say personally altruistic like he thinks what he's doing is going to save the
universe while in this one he's getting to the point where he's like okay we're going to restart
the universe because you guys are stupid well i mean they have that line about well apparently
what i did didn't work or didn't serve the purpose that i needed so i need to go further yeah um
what do you reckon eo um i just found it all incredibly lame that he's just fighting a bunch
of strangers basically even if they did subvert his plan it's just coming off it's a big deal
infinity war it is a big deal but coming off of an infinity war where i don't know just severed
i felt like it severed so much from that like it's not the guy that iron man knows
better if you know what i mean yeah yeah it literally is connection yeah so far more impactful
if it was the original Thanos who went through fighting all of them yeah i think so too and
that's just cut off and i didn't really like that i can definitely see why people are upset and i
can definitely agree that i was a little bit like i miss big strong altruistic amazing quotes thanos
who would be kind to a lot of the people he kills and i've seen the people will be like oh yeah he
only did that because he was in a position of power and this is the first time he's really
experienced being vulnerable and that's why he's much more blah blah and i was like yeah but like
he's kind of an asshole now i i don't know i i feel like the the desperation of a situation
he finds himself in where he knows that these people have the capability to thwart his plan
for the first time i think that might change his the way that he behaves i think i agree it's just
not necessarily what um what i personally wanted to see out of out of this sort of story lengths
we get one shot right this is an interesting one for sure but um you know as weird as it is to say
i prefer 2019 thanos to 2024 thanos or whatever the timelines are uh i find him more interesting
he's a little bit too just i just want to fuck everything up um but you know it's fine i still
enjoyed him but i know a lot of people feel like he was fucked up uh it's hard to sort of maybe i'm
just forgetting it because it's been like a good year since i saw infinity war um or maybe not
that long but where was this fucking giant double bladed sword thing in the previous movie i guess
he didn't need it uh when he had the gauntlet right i don't know sure but it would have been
kind of cool to see that yeah actually i i didn't like the sword because i think it's a silly weapon
it doesn't make a lot of sense uh you mean like you would have preferred an actual sword versus
this weird like oh yeah like this weird thing doesn't like you know from a utilitarian
perspective it's a really shitty weapon it could have been a lot of things it seems to be magical
i mean i i like the sword i just don't remember it being an infinity war or guardians but i haven't
seen guardians in a long time so i was just genuinely curious uh yeah he doesn't he doesn't
have it in infinity war i don't think so anyway uh infinity is like what four or five years
something could have happened to that thing over the many conquests good old thanos has
so that's past thanos isn't it you know and if someone is yeah wait yeah that that's from the
guardians yeah future thanos wouldn't have okay um yeah so in in the thanos that they fight at
the end this is a thanos that hasn't lost gamora uh do you mean like he's not got an appreciation
for loss as much i'm i mean i'm yeah i'm just i'm saying maybe that's a big difference is that he
hasn't you know i guess maybe he you know that's a that's something that really changes him as a
character and he doesn't have that in this version that they find
perfectly balanced that might actually be why they chose to do it that way maybe maybe yeah um
uh so something that frustrates me i don't know how you guys are gonna feel about this or chat or
whatever you got thor with mjolnir and stormbreaker iron man what you could argue is probably his best
suit and cap uh potentially his best especially when he has mjolnir they all lose pretty hardcore
to thanos without the gauntlet not a fan uh yeah i think they should have fucked them up
i think what should have happened is that they got to the point where he was about to be beaten
and he called in his army and they prevented the avenger or those three from finishing him off
and then you know they fuck him up to the point where all those portals open blah blah happens i
just thought i was confused as to how his thanos just and i've seen explanations people like don't
get it he's more of a battle hardened warrior who's pissed he's gonna be and he's got this
weapon he's just gonna fuck him up and just like no i can't he had the gauntlet at infinity war
and i have bad managed to make him bleed yeah i just i feel like they just needed the fight to
go on and they needed stakes to be raised so thanos is more powerful now
oh you got why he beat up the hulk without using stones yes he did uh well then again
he had one stone at that point right the power one he didn't use the power stone to beat him up
though i guess um yeah that's true um hmm so but you get the four i still feel like three of them
yeah like this we're not dealing with like this is big those those three put together especially
iron man and thor like i just i don't really see how it was pretty easy for him to do but i'll let
it slide i guess because thor was out of shape and iron man iron man got like electrocuted at
one point or something by mjolnir i thought that was weird because he like he like falls over and
there's loads of electric on him and then he gets knocked out and i was like oh already i need to
watch it again to really figure out exactly what's going on there but yeah when did iron man set up
that fucking thing where if thor electrocutes him in the back he has super well weapons that
happens in avengers where thor electrocutes and he gets superpower yeah but it looks like he's
actually created something to account for it now as well which makes it better but i mean fuck it
doesn't really do anything does it yeah i must have just forgotten it it's been a while since i
saw avengers um i liked when nebula killed herself i did too i thought that was awesome
i thought that was really um this will sound really gay but i thought that was a super good
kind of visualization of her internal struggle with herself yep and i like actually having to
kill herself i like that past nebula clearly wants to change but she's too afraid of thanos to do it
because the change she gets from guardians one and two is all because she's so far away from thanos
and it's good shit yeah what do you think yeah yeah it's okay i'm all for them and herory have
you seen the guardians films i've seen yeah both of them i don't remember two very well but yeah
maybe best that you don't remember two yeah maybe i mean i like two why do you like why do you hate
too wolf age of ultron no he's talking about guardians oh i'm sorry i'm retarded did you say
you like yeah you like yeah because i watched it with you the other day i was confused you know i
i was drawn a yeah i'm sorry i mean i like the second guardians more than the first i actually
like him on the first as well but i think the first one's better but it's got more problems than the
first yeah but i like it more than um all right so there you go rags go nuts uh cap picking up
mjolnir i liked it i imagine that's one of those uh cinemas all over the world go nuts for that
moment i mean i i appreciated it because in one of the other avengers movies they kind of hint at
the fact that captain yeah age of ultron is like mjolnir you know a budge is a little for captain
america now i will say there i mean that's a big difference between you know it moving at all um
and him being able to use it you know in this potential but i i do think it's set up um and i
thought i thought it was really i just thought it was really cool my theater went fucking ballistic
over that scene well my theater went ballistic over quite a few moments in the third act so yeah
oh yeah did you think i was at a fucking football game did you see this in a theater yeah
i did did you find it obnoxious very much so i can picture you being the kind of guy who's just
like shut the fuck up every yeah when uh the portal started opening and black panther came
out and everyone started cheering i was like why are you cheering for this one
like of all the fucking avengers fucking black panther but then they started cheering for literally
every single person that was on screen i mean it was kind of a cool moment but at the same time i
was like can you guys just shut the fuck up please yeah um we went pretty early in the day
so we got really good seats and we saw it in a mostly empty theater so we really lucked out but
there were still some people um like there was a kid next to me and i was almost like listen here
you little shit go your fucking mouth all right like actually adults well i remember there was
something that he said during the movie and i was just like oh you sweet summer child you don't
understand why this is a great scene um like i it was like it was it was just it was like a kid
watching it and he and he's seen he made a comment about a scene like mate i think he
didn't like it but i thought it was really good because i remember it was set up in some way from
a previous movie or something and i was almost like i was almost about to fucking explain this
to this person next to me like um but yeah i imagine if you saw oh i'd seen this movie in a
full theater fuck that shit i watched it on opening night so it was a full theater yeah
mine was full but i was british so most of them shut the fuck up but you still got the
average couple people they're like oh black panther what kind of forever and stuff like that like
shut up they can't hear you no you should say shut up it was a bad movie that'll get him to uh
to to shut up it'll be great um yeah i loved all of it but i thought maybe he was a little bit
too good with it he was awfully good with that hammer like i'm all for every movie does except
lightning ones i was like isn't that thaws thing i thought milne was just a you know like an
amplifier i didn't realize it actually created lightning yeah that seemed a little off to me
like how would he know how to summon the lightning if he's never used uh the hammer before and like
when he threw the shield and threw the hammer and it made his shockwave that actually like made
the fuck i was like oh so awesome and then he like summons light i was like whoa you the god of
thunder now kind of makes thor a little more useless than he already was a cool moment
nonetheless and then that brings in the whole fucking everybody arrives so um i have no idea
how we should talk about this other than like um everyone shows up it's insane i was like what the
yeah i i didn't think that it'd be i just thought it would be like the avengers come through
like the avengers arrive somehow like oh shit i know what's happening we have to go
but then everybody shows up and i'm like whoa i i thought it was a really cool moment it was
just my theater was so obnoxious it was like killing it for me but that's not the fault of
me i was i was i was into it but totally superficially i was just like yeah i was yeah
i'm doing the same thing as i was like i accepted it i'm like yeah everyone gets to do their little
thing at the end like okay cool you know spider-man and black panther and valkyrie and all these guys
are doing their stuff i mean when you think about it it's like who went to fucking uh new asgarden
was like all right everyone we need you all to come here get a pegasus and everything
where'd you get the fucking pegasus from oh negabot said in fairness the uh the quote from odin is
whomsoever holds this hammer if he be worthy shall possess the power of thaw so technically
that's consistent okay yeah all right yeah all right okay um yeah there's uh everyone turns up
at their best is my confusion everyone's in their like element you know and it's like when you guys
all like what the fuck just happened um but you know everyone and fucking hell talk to strangers
a lot of students i had no idea that was going on i guess the whole college the whole everyone i
guess the whole fucking all the hog work showed up yeah i just assumed it was like from all of the
wizard temples is someone still defending their sanctums though mamu could turn up at any moment
guys i don't know i guess the immediate threat is i don't know yeah yeah i'm kidding um
um yeah when they all run and fly together i was just like jesus christ it's like such a
insane it's the biggest fan service moment yeah i think i might have ever seen yeah
but i was like okay all right let's just i just strap myself into the roller coaster i'm like
okay here we go everyone's gonna do their thing here we are i feel like we're heading so far into
subjective territory here but there's somebody like fucking ad man punching the the space whale
thing i was just like oh that's so cool yeah that was that was really that was really cool
drac's jumping on the back of the big dude i was like oh it's not just straight up referencing
guardians too he's just like oh i liked seeing drac's is barely in this film yeah so it's nice
he got something um seeing tony and and pepper doing their respective iron man blasts the same
time i was like oh that's neat but uh in a perfect world they would have probably
added more uh a through line those two if you look at iron man one through three it's very um
iffy and like she drops out of the mcu for a bit like when civil war happens he's just like
yeah she's just not around she's like oh but i think it works enough also thought being like
give me back my hammer shit was like you could have the small one i do like that there's plenty
like this won't get out there's loads of payoffs in here that are just like a lot of fun that i
think work um i don't know if we need to develop it but literally every fucking scene that has
peter and iron man in the shot i adored oh when dude when when peter shows back up and iron man's
looking at him oh my fucking heart yeah jesus christ let's see i'm i'm i am a big softie when
it comes to like um like emotional stuff like this this movie for all of its objective issues
that we've been highlighting so far this movie oh my god i was in tears for like half this movie
because i'm just a massive faggot but the there were so many you can't call yourself a massive
i gave myself the license i am massive but i was like i was almost like on the point of being
embarrassed that there are other people around and i didn't want them to see me with like red
theory eyes and everything like that's kind of how i was so that's why i rate this movie so high
like subjectively even though objectively it's got a lot of issues but fucking hell the character
payoffs in the moments and robert downey jr's acting and oh fuck um yeah i thought they were
both amazing and i was just like what a perfect scene to have after all the shit that's happened
for those two just nailed um what else is there yeah they are like peter meeting up with blank
gamora i guess if you can call it that just like recognition that i guess that relationship is
restarted i don't know what they're doing with that exactly because i don't know how many guardians
films is going to be i don't know what the plan is there um and again to sort of highlight how much
i feel like hulk was thrown away in this film you get one shot of him in the fight i believe
where he's like yeah i genuinely don't even remember him being in the fight i don't remember
it either it's it actually it's like he just disappeared for that whole segment until uh
picks a guy up and throws him whatever and then he says uh we can't like because someone's like hey
get the stones out of here and he's like no we have to return them to you know their places or
whatever which highlights something i was thinking about and again i could be wrong but correct me if
i'm wrong captain marvel holding the gauntlet and going to jump into the quantum machine
what does that solve for the other timelines where does she even go what does she does she
have any idea what's about to happen when she does that um i don't know what they were doing
first off why doesn't why doesn't she just snap her fingers right there when she's got it oh well
yeah you could definitely i mean someone someone pointed out if she if if they made that happen if
captain marvel used the gauntlet i would i would have screamed at this at the screen
that would have been unforgivable someone also pointed out war machine just bullshits his way
into getting new armor yeah i i meant to bring that up thought war machine just has armor and
you're like oh looks like where'd you get that from i don't i don't know why just you just yeah
and i don't know why they couldn't just all they needed to do was just don't make him get out of
his armor in the first place well he gets his new armor before that because it looks different
from the one he jumps out of so just get him the new armor before that shit happens and then have
him helping the hulk hold up something or at the very least show him like calling the armor in like
iron man did in the past yeah yeah uh genuine logistically i don't understand what the fuck
they were telling captain marvel to do go into the thing it has to she needs to go to like three
different points in time or even four she has no idea what even deliver these stones back to
like i don't even know what the hell they were thinking with that just hopefully she just goes
away i don't know i just thought it was really weird i was like you guys know that this isn't
gonna solve the problems but you know luckily she doesn't make it anyway but that brings us to um
you know what did you guys think of the um the shot with all of the wamen
yeah that wasn't forced as fuck
you know i think it's funny because a lot of people might be like oh man if he was
fucking guys you wouldn't be complaining i was like i would be if they literally just had all
of the guys i clapped when i saw all the wamen i clapped even harder when i saw captain america's
or captain marvel's fucking lesbian hair oh right yeah so that's from the comics apparently so
everyone criticizing it is wrong apparently that's how that works yeah if it's in the comics
it can't be dumb yeah that's what you have to bobbles hair fuck that oh i i hear i actually
i liked her better with longer hair because it would cover up more of her face um i mean i don't
think it it makes sense that her hair is like if i was a chick my hair would be short which is
ironic because my hair is really long right now but it just seems more battle you know yeah
this has looked kind of silly to me but fine
armies have a you know dress code for facial hair and you know hair and stuff so
man i was fine with it i don't wait are we actually talking about captain marvel's haircut
well you that was a sideline what we're actually rags let me ask you what did you think of the
old female shot uh i rolled my eyes it's like because i i saw it happening i'm like oh like
these are for oh there's oh they're all oh you know um i was definitely distracted but
what really took me out was the fact that mantis is there yeah it's like hold on why is mantis what
is mantis ever done aside from well i like mantis but what the hell is she doing there
oh yeah i mean i like her too but still but she's not like a a warrior
like what does she do she's really good for character stuff emotional stuff connection
between people very good for that but what is she gonna do in a fight like even when she was with ego
she's gonna make people feel bad she's gonna put people to sleep i guess oh fucking she doesn't
even do anything she's just with them then starts to run and i was like okay i'm waiting for mantis
payoff now the same for shuri by the way which makes more sense but it's still kind of like
why are you doing why is she in the front yeah she is like supposed to be some bullshit brilliant
scientist and she's got like gauntlets that push people away when she fires them
um but that's that's nice that's nice that you have that but i don't um and it was and all the
girls were here except black widow oh right yeah that's so i kind of this is kind of the one that
has the best development i was gonna say like she's basically the only one i care about she's
the one i mean i i guess i kind of like scarlet witch yes i like scarlet witch i like valkyrie i
like mantis but black widow is no so it made me miss black widow um so there's a couple people
out there who were like that ruined it for me and i'm like it didn't ruin it for me i just thought
it was really silly i just rolled my eyes and was like yeah yeah yeah now i will say that scarlet
witch and the Thanos little thing that they did was pretty nice that was fucking awesome the the
i kind of want to get a screenshot of when she's lifting up all the balls at the same time the
poach hasn't how fucking like she looks like an eagle person like glowing yeah she looks badass as
hell yeah it's like i don't know you and she's like you will did anyone else just get like a
surge of satisfaction when Thanos just punched captain marvel and we're getting no no we're
getting there we can that needs a whole discussion um yeah i like that he actually is defeated by
scarlet witch without the gauntlet i was like finally like a power level that at least the
consistent with because the thing is scarlet witch is what you would call a glass cannon right
she's actually yeah killable with a bullet but she's still probably the most powerful avenger
not anymore obviously but she was up until tism hero did her tisms but so uh yeah so we get into
that so Thanos is a desperation move pulls in uh his ship to shoot everything basically yeah
and everyone's like panicking like oh my god oh my god and then the ship
moves every single cannon you fire on one target and it fails miserably and when that happened i
was like no please no before you go further what i thought was gonna happen was when all
the cannons were pointing upwards i thought it would be like um all the people from the guardians
of the galaxy um the scrolls as well maybe yeah not not the scrolls or the creed not the
rat it will the ravagers and oh you mean like the gold people yeah the gold people why not people
from the first guardians that they save oh you thought yeah but zandos destroyed at this point
i think oh maybe like all of uh yandu's buddies yeah i was expecting for like the guardians
ships to come in i think zandar still actually around i think at that point so the nova core
would be the ones yeah nova core yeah also yeah sorry my bad the ravages were actually in the
fight um but that would be cool these the cosmic team you know coming in like there's other planets
and stuff going on and they're like oh this Thanos guy is getting fought over here and they're
putting up a fight well we're gonna help out because fuck Thanos yeah you could have like a
line or you could have captain marvel leading them as much as i wanted to be there and she's
like i gathered them for this i'll be like okay but it's literally just but it doesn't matter
because what do you need after captain marvel and she destroys his entire ship by walking right
through it and i was like oh completely effortlessly destroys the entire warship no issue no problem
doesn't even break a sweat her hair is fucking perfect and that's that happens
what's your thing she gets posted on the face no no no we're getting there um so
i think it kind of is really lame that she did that i think it's very lame too it cheapens things
so much a lot of people have been saying end game is not ruined by captain marvel she's barely in
it and i'm like she deals damage for the time that she's here for sure oh yeah i mean you don't
yeah i mean you don't have to fucking look at her smug cunt face very long but while you do
oh man she makes use of the time she's in it
yeah so she does that there's the old female thing then i guess it comes down to like the
final fight with Thanos and sort of the main three uh until he backs him off and then she starts like
she's able to prevent him from closing the fist and he head he head butts here and there's this
shot you guys remember it where he's like terrified like Thanos is scared because he
headbutted her and it did fuck all and i was like weird because he's like punched and kicked people
and sent them back and well i just confirmed she's like the most powerful thing on this fucking
earth on it well i don't know the universe i hate her so much i hate captain marvel so much smaller
i hate her i hate her a lot too and it doesn't even it doesn't come into whatever a character
is at that point doesn't even matter that power level what are you doing what the hell like even
Thanos is like what this isn't right i'm supposed to be the bad guy like how are you doing this
and so he pulls the power stone out and fucking boops with the other hand um there was this like
massive sigh of relief uh from me in the cinema i was on the edge of my seat like please don't
let her kill him please don't let it i've never been so concerned for the life of a horrible villain
i was watching those two together and i'm like if she if she just i'm i was so relieved
i was so relieved because they could have done it they could have
fuck who knows disney might have told them you have to have this happen
or some bullshit like that but luckily it didn't get the the blowing up the ship thing and her
holding his hand open were that was a big stuff uh who holding the hand open would have worked
for me if the headbutt dude the headbutt i was like what the fuck if he had headbutt and she flew
across the ground into a wall i've been like cool but she literally doesn't even flinch she's just
like lol you try to help headbutt me but then he punches her and she he's like what is what is
what i don't even understand what she's supposed to be is like she's selectively god yes
i don't i she's super op and i don't understand how they're going to deal with that uh going
forward exactly gonna have to give her super op enemies i guess i'm at least i'm at least i'm glad
that even though she's in this universe still i my investment in the universe is far less like
i can still almost assuredly enjoy the next guardians movie and she'll never show her
fucking face in it yes and almost surely she won't be in spider-man i hope you know it's
it's like all the other avenger stuff that they do in the future is going to have this
this this awful specter of captain marvel hanging over it
uh um
you don't like that carol's only weakness being the greatest power in the universe
i mean this is so a lot of people said like in fairness he wasn't able to close the gauntlet
and they kind of established that he can't use the gauntlet's power unless he can make a fist
so he's really just normal thanos when he had butts here and he goes ow while the powerstones
have complete power over here so isn't that okay and i'm like hmm i'm not saying it doesn't make
sense with the power levels the fact that she pierced his ship is consistent with her movie
it's just like lame as fuck it's like how bad it is yeah that that shit it shouldn't have happened
in her movie the question is like why didn't she just blast through the entire battlefield at
light speed killing all of the bad guys just go yeah why didn't she do that to thanos why
didn't she just fly right through his chest yeah why didn't she just light speed through him
um why didn't why didn't she use the gauntlet instead of tony she probably would have survived
just fine i don't know i mean she is the she's the hyperspace jump of the mcu is like what do
you do now like what do you do now so uh moving forward tony snatches all of the the gems out of
the thing any i guess made a backup in his own suit that makes it wick so there's a question
a lot of people have of how the hell did he survive having those five stones when uh it's
pretty much established that if you touch one as a human it'll like obliterate you i guess it's
because he's not making direct contact or um i guess i guess it's established that if he could
apparently make the first one then i don't know i guess using it as the issue like having them
is one thing but using their power is another i think i think that the best explanation we'll
have is that he did it quickly i guess he did it he just did it quickly and yeah he didn't like hold
on to it and i liked by the way that he was able to snatch the stones out of the thing because it's
all nanotech so it would make sense that that's something you could do and i like the idea that
he created a fail safe in his own suit to account for this that he thought that's a possibility
but yeah that's all stuff that i think yeah yeah that's something that tony stark would do
there we come to a question did his snap send them all back to 2014 or kill them all
kill all of the um badman all of the chitarian Thanos did he kill them or did he send them
back from where they came why would it send them back rather than kill them that is my question
but a lot of people online seem to think that he sent them back and i was like i'm pretty sure he
murdered them i think what would that what would that fixed because captain america has to go back
and put all the fucking stones back so what would that fix by just sending them to the past i mean
i just i don't i don't understand the motivation to send them back that doesn't make any fucking
sense oh yeah i just want to make sure i mentioned it because a lot of people seem to think that's
what happened uh he sent them to Medea yeah we'll take care of him yeah so as far as i can tell
he killed them all i think we're safe to assume that uh i quite liked Thanos having his peaceful
death like the end of infinity war kind of mirrored that he was just like oh there's no way
i can win now okay yeah i like that he just sat down and was just like he's soaking it up all in
just thinking about it he failed right and this is the thing his character in the beginning of
infinity war talks about how like he's motivated entirely by the fact that he's failed previously
so this must be quite a sad moment for him to be honest he's like well i fucked it up again
for the last time oh i the scene though i mean just that line that you know robert down to
junior says when he snaps his fingers oh i am i a man right yeah i probably shouldn't have
gone over that it was fucking great fucking fucking perfect just fucking nailed it oh hey
yo you must have liked that right because you like i bet yeah yeah i did like it nice callback um and
it's like it's not just like a character thing but you know imagine robert downey junior his last
lines um he's been doing these movies for 10 years now that's one of his big things is he
robert downey junior is iron man you know that's the character that he portrays
so it's like he's like the last lines he says is you know this is who i am
oh perfect and the following scene with between him and war machine him and spider-man and him
and pepper i don't have a problem with any of it it's sublime it's everything i wanted
so it's up to you guys to criticize it like i'm not doing it it's perfect
i don't have any criticisms of that i was so into the film on that moment and i think it's
just the fact that i feel like i really have been invested since 2008 love it so much
and this is what what what propel those moments propel it to the the subjective scale for me
like so and you're like all the time travel doesn't make sense the choices people are making
and all that stuff and i'm like yep all those things are problems but uh this is working
this scene is working on me completely uh and yeah i think um the fact that she says
uh we're gonna be fine you can rest like i don't think there are better
there's a better send off there's a better thing to say to his character that's exactly what he
wants he's always wanted no there was no moment with i don't think there was anything with captain
america though i think it was just spider-man pepper no yeah they show thor and cap reacting to it
nothing like some kind of uh we don't need buck oh wait no i was thinking i was already thinking
ahead to fucking um captain america no yeah uh and there's a thing you have tony's best friend
tony's gill friend slash wife tony's surrogate child and tony's two work buddies that are also
best friends all of them get their separate reaction shots or at least what most of them
like tony and uh cap and thaws is the same and i was just thinking to the fact it's like
oh yeah you checked them all off the list that's how you do it good and then ryan johnson was like
how about we don't show luke reacting to han doesn't that make it better though and you're like
no no it's like oh well you guys can do it the cliche way like we already have you seen i come
if i mentioned this on efap but people have actually said like why show the scene of of
luke reacting to han when we already know he's going to be upset
did this argument does anyone want to i haven't i have that position yes ironically yes
are they retarded it's one of those arguments that feels like it counters itself you're like
i don't even it's almost the most self-evident fucking thing i don't have to i don't have to go
to um it's almost like your parents are gonna die and they want you to be there at their deathbed
and you're like they know i love they know i'm sad they know i'm sad uh so a bunch of people have
been talking about the whole like i'm just trying to go chronologically here i think you see spiderman
going back to high school and net is the same age as him so and assuming far from home happens the
way it does in the trailer i guess everybody who's significant to peter's life all got snapped
along with him otherwise continuity wise that's fucked i guess certainly a lot of people must have
yeah i think we just have to call a convenience on that one it's like yep they just ended up that
they were all snapped that's uh they all back it's all good yeah it would be nice to it would
be nice that there is going to be a line that explains or should have been where you know
i guess you know i guess iron man or i guess tony with his snap you know
oh yeah and i i guess the funeral for tony was like perfect to me i don't know what you guys
reckon i mean i i i was down with it yeah i was totally with it the fact that they panned through
basically all of the franchises once they panned from iron man i was just like oh man that's like a
like a meta way of celebrating what that movie did and how it's going to be you know what what
comes after it as a result as well as it being like an in-universe sort of thank you for killing
yourself for everybody's life sort of thing now i like it now i already know the answer because i
had to look it up um of the three of you when during that funeral scene when it panned through
him you saw that one kid just standing around who was he i i know the answer mauler do you know
yes er i do not um well for you too it was the kid from iron man three
apparently nobody fucking knew who he was in fairness he doesn't look a lot like he did no
he doesn't which is like why would you even include him why i i don't i'm not against including him
um him and tony spent a decent amount of time together and tony gave him a bunch of shit at
the end of the movie they had a connection i hate iron man 3 i really do but i'm the kind of person
that's like okay we should probably you can't just like if you're gonna try and make a continuity
like the mca you can't just go nah not this film though and you could say they've done that with
hulk but i don't know what they could have taken from hulk anyway they took ross so do you do you
think that they should have had something for black widow uh well they technically did they had
they did have that that uh that talk on the fucking yeah that was for widow and vision
they both yeah yeah um yeah yeah um but i was just wondering if you think they should have done more
i quite liked his voice that i wish she just knew and then she says that i think they both do
they both know yeah nice just girl at which says that um yeah um
so if we ignore because we kind of been over it the whole how the fuck does cap get all that
shit back to its places just put it to a side a second uh well how did everyone feel about caps
ending i don't like it um i don't like that fucking bucky wouldn't go up and talk to him
yeah i that my biggest issue with it is bucky i i like bucky and i feel like he's never used enough
i mean i was yeah i honestly when i i thought that they would look out
and there'd be like two graves and they'd be buried next to each other or something like that
um they would do something along that line but i was almost like what bucky is right there
i really like bucky he's standing there why is he not what we needed falcon is one thing like okay
but bucky though we needed a scene where those two got to talk about everything and concluded
everything and then the scene ends with cap going one more thing i need you to do then it cuts and
then we come to the part in the movie where this happening and that's why bucky says hey go talk to
him to thingy because fucking hell where was caps goodbye to his longtime best friend i mean the movie
even drew attention to it earlier when cap had to tell cap like bucky's alive and that shocked him
enough to win the fight yeah um but then he just doesn't have a goodbye with his best friend to
clarify there's a whole fucking movie about this people are pointing out it really pissed me off
i just want to make sure everyone knows yes we it's clear that winter soldier knew that cap wasn't
coming back so they had a talk the problem is we didn't see that talk that's got it we just talked
about how you need to show shit like this you know like these we need it for the story would you
have would you have preferred that bucky's the next caps in america um so the problem for falcon is
that he's not a super soldier they'll give him a shield it's just gadgets i think that he's better
i like falcon but he's got his wings and his gadgets and his cool shit and i love the idea
that the winter soldier is known as a villain and so he takes on captain america to try and write
his wrongs quote unquote you know yeah yeah so i would have preferred that but i guess there's
one good thing in that we get to call him captain falcon now well it's almost it i mean i've seen a
lot of people saying like oh we got valkyrie king and you know she's uh she's super diverse
and oh now captain america is super diverse and like okay that's what i got from it too and i was
like oh i don't like it i was i was like mmm bucky though bucky is okay we this makes so much
less sense than bucky i was irritated with the fact they didn't have enough cap and bucky in
this movie yeah i think i mean i understand like not coming he doesn't come back till the end but
we needed that talk with them after everything they've been through it was bullshit that they
wouldn't have bucky talk to him or at least if they did show it yeah it looks like we totally
agreed a lot um also doesn't him going back in time and then living out his days kind of
fuck with the time travel thing even more uh i guess if he if he doesn't interact with anything
then it should be okay the idea from what i've seen is that he would have kept his identity
secret and he wouldn't have involved himself in anything else and peggy would have understood
what he's talking about and she would have kept it a secret too and they would you know she's got
pull it shield she could give him a new identity he could just get a job at some retail place and
you know have his life with her i guess yeah but then who takes over captain america's place
throughout all the rest of the movies at that point through that timeline i don't know if i
don't know i don't know i haven't thought enough about how it works like well i think the regular
captain america that the original would have played out like normal there just would have
been another captain america out there basically just being a regular person
um it does seem a bit weird but i don't know i was a sucker for the fact that he got his dance
yeah i'm i'm fine with it because i think captain america would just like done the secret identity
stayed off the grid just lived a normal life because he knew that his other self would be
around to make all the events happen um but yeah i thought that was really good that he finally
got that thing that he really wanted um eel what did you think of captain america
i'm gonna have to go against the grain a little bit oh uh didn't really like that he
basically abandoned his post i agree with that in america hmm i mean i i'm against his character
in a way i i i i get wanting to go back for your girl i mean it just did not seem in character i
have to agree with wolf there i i think that if he did his captain america stuff then he would know
because he knew that things would work out a certain way and if he became captain america
then he knew there would be a time where another captain america is you know brought into the world
yeah and that would cause serious issues
wait people are saying cap let night 11 happened
oh you could have stopped it cap there's actually yeah you probably could have done
it he wouldn't have fucked anything well but right yeah i think 9 11 is a that's a pretty
serious thing they got that got a lot of stuff in the world happening um yeah no that's interesting
as a take uh i've not really thought about whether or not it's in character because obviously he loves
her and he wants to be with her but how much would he want to his whole thing is a man out of
time a man in a constant war like he needs a war to continue so his whole thing and uh right super
altruistic always wants to save lives and make lives better and protect the world and it's just
like so what changed what made him decide you know what we're done well i guess we don't know
if he didn't do that during his his his go-through like did he i mean is there gonna be um it's not
stated that he didn't do those things do what things just you know save people and do be like a
superhero um i don't know that he wasn't like captain america but i doubt that it didn't
influence his life in some way and oh like he became some form of vigilante but stayed under
the radar it's it's possible i mean i don't think we have anything to go by to say yes or no
um yeah sure well i mean but if he's going back he has to lay low doesn't he kind of yeah we
have to in the sense that yeah he could lay low but he wouldn't necessarily have to interact with
extremely big you know world altering events he might need plastic surgery though because
his face for at least 10 years or so it's gonna be really easy to recognize
nice at least from unless he grows out that beard again that'll do it we're a hat in the first place
um yeah okay it seems like people are torn on that i from what i can tell no one's unhappy
with iron man's story um a lot of people are unhappy with thor's i was about to say like
yeah he passes it off he passes as god off to valkyrie which really didn't sit well with me at
all yeah i didn't i was like no no no we haven't earned this you need a movie for that honestly
you need a movie for this she was only through like half of thor ragnarok and then hasn't
shown up until now so it's we told oden think we're told that she's a decent leader for the past
five years like i mean i i heard that and i was like it wasn't the first time we ever saw her
she was drunk off her ass and fell off a ship yeah apparently she's going through a whole arc we
didn't see great yeah i know right uh but yeah thor ended up with guardians great potential as far
as i'm concerned yeah i think that at least we can walk away saying i'm super ready to see a
guardians with thor in it just this coming expense of what i would consider to be i think it's against
his character uh do something like that it's one thing if he doesn't want to be king if he just
doesn't he feels like it's not the thing for him that there's stuff out there that he needs to do
or that he's been given like what about the other as guards out there and things like that that's
one thing but what if you just have it be so casually passed off to somebody like he made her
awards for um or like a steward of of guardians and he's like i need time i need to find myself
i need to figure things out he goes to the guardians who at least we could be like oh
yeah maybe we'll we'll get like it's not done you know yeah something i don't know
and yeah looks like him and peter are gonna be uh back and forth and i guess but uh you know
what's funny the reality stone is a stone so is cap gonna go back in time and make natalie
portman swallow it or something how do you how do you get uh i need you to eat this rock
just do it don't ask it's a magic rock do it because i thought it was weird that they didn't
account for that the briefcase thing that cap has i was like shouldn't one of those be a liquid or
whatever because you got to inject it okay how awkward would that be cap travels to as guard
and he's like okay i need to find natalie portman and as guard i hope no one sees me and i need to
eject to it i'm just like god that's a whole film right there project her with the rock
oh god that sounds kind of rapey she wakes up and like i feel so real question how
what are the machines for the time traveling machines what are they for what are the time
traveling machines for yeah and i'm waiting for you to give me an answer so that i can
provide a problem when you say time traveling machines yeah what do you mean those the
platforms they step on before time traveling cap does it at the end and they do it obviously in the
avengers compound i guess it's like a tether point yeah like an anchor point a tether because they
even say that the little things on their arm they're like gpses but they're able to maybe
that's the reference that the g that the gps uses well i mean it's weird if that's all they
are because they do like all kinds of weird crazy shit right like the the ceiling of it all moves
it's all like moving pieces of metal and glass or whatever i was just one just like it's it seems
like it's probably doing stuff i don't know either way well because they do they do the time travel
with antman at the beginning and tests and stuff and they don't have the platform they just have
the truck i guess the truck functions as that platform i don't know maybe i guess they just
in order because they did it three time it took tests either way i wanted to make it certain
because you've got a couple of answers in chat like it allows access to the quantum realm
it'll act as a place to you know have time and place a an easy place to come back to
sciency stuff um either way they managed to travel back in time from 2012 to 1970s without
any kind of machine so i was just curious if you know what i mean like i'm just i have a
what's the machine even really for i guess it was to be like the is it just an anchor point
for the yeah for them to be able to go back to for it to i'll have to i guess i'll have to
just concede on it being an anchor point because i don't see it being anything else really
i mean that's it i i would assume either that or in because of the tests that they did
once they figured out the right one they were like all right this is what we need to do and
to make sure there's no issues we build a machine it's like if it's like a waypoint then why does
it need all of the crazy tisms around it you know that are doing all kinds of weird things
like wouldn't it just be okay tell tell me how the time machine work technology works um well
apparently it doesn't have anything to do with the machine it just has to do with their suits
and the pimp articles well i think the pimp particles in the suits i mean i think it makes
sense that the suits would be would have some connection to the anchor point machine
possibly but then thanos doesn't do anything like that well he just comes through onto the platform
yeah um i don't know there's probably some weird things going on there i just it didn't quite i
was just like i figured what they were trying to say was the machines are needed to travel
back and forth someone saying established and maintains the bridge to the quantum realm
awesome yeah i don't really know
i'm just like yeah i don't know i guess that works um but yeah that's pretty much it that is the film
so um anyone else got anything they kind of want to say about it or um yeah about the time travel
machine well just about the film now so um for example um has anybody's ratings or feelings
changed on it while talking about definitely a lot of objective issues but i still feel like there
is enough i still love it i think my i think i'll bump down my objective from a six to a
a what i don't know i'm thinking uh low maybe like uh i might put it as a four to five four or five
maybe four point five yeah objectively yeah well then now that i think about it there's a lot of
weird stuff that i can't really definitively say is bad or not because it's all weird time travel
stuff yeah there's a lot i need to understand before i can say it's bad i guess it's like
it's like a rival in a way it's like it's so ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple
ways and even the people who say that we're wrong disagree with each other so um i leave
it as a five because there's definitely issues definitely issues i was gonna say i'm pretty much
stable on five before i find more out about the film yeah but in and subjectively i'm still gonna
i still think the strengths just make up for all of the the weaknesses oh that was yas i was changing
doesn't matter anyway i didn't change it um wolf uh yeah i i'm safe with saying
five objectively uh i guess i never was really as invested in the mcu
in general so i can't really change subjectively over like a seven i still really like it though
even though it has like a lot of really big issues oh was there a post-credits scene no no okay i
think so because the people the the people in theater said because the the ushers for the
theater were telling folks don't worry there's not a there's not an incorrect scene so we could
fucking clean the theater for the next showing because it was just doing like non-stop in-game
runs they're making so much fucking money from this movie dude oh jesus christ my theater has
been packed pretty much all hours of the day for the past three days their opening has made 1.2
billion holy fuck yeah this is this is destroying records this movie 1.2 billion is their opening
it was referred to as their opening weekend one point two billion for nobody in the in the
weekend that's insane holy shit it's the only movie that has a chance to knock avatar off its throat
wow i hope it does it's way better than avatar i can't remember much of avatar but i didn't really
like it that much let's watch it again for e-fat movie we could i'd be okay with that
Pocahontas in space um but yeah er is your ratings are they the same
yeah pretty much i'm not a huge marvel guy so subjectively i mean i understand that the fan
service is pretty on point i thought but it doesn't affect me as much yeah i think that makes
better much sense uh this is i guess i'll leave it to chat for a few minutes just at me if there's
something in the film you feel like we didn't talk about we'll do our best to try and uh cover
it quickly before we move on so i saw one of them was um cap returning the soul stone is like
for one how do you even do that and two wouldn't it have been cool to see him see red skull
be like oh dude hey what's up i've been fucking here how would that conversation go down
i think they just stare at each other and be like well we hate each other captain would have been
like this is what you deserve to be stuck here forever caps like so you're a nazgul now
that's kind of cool yeah i got to keep my red face though i float a robe i just shit in it
yeah i heard the the take as well that um the reason why it's a curse for him to be there is
because the the stone requires you to sacrifice something you love and he never loved anything
i was like okay one even if he did love anything he can't sacrifice because he's on his own
it wasn't gonna do sacrifice his cloak did he love it i don't know maybe maybe his only clothing so
probably it's all that he has is his cloak so he develops an actual real love for it he throws it
off the movie out of that then you see naked red skull floating around with his soul stone
oh we can have like a castaway in space but with red skull i really like this soul stone
but i wish i had my cloak back we've been through so much oh you forgot to change rags rating from
six to five uh i mean it's not too big of a deal he said it i'm not going to keep these i'm just
going to delete the notepad anyway hulk arm regeneration i mean hulk stayed in like an arm
thing throughout the whole movie didn't he was in a cast during the funeral um we covered the
fortnite thing uh how long till we get big brain videos about how objectively endgame was terrible
um i will say i really liked the rock dude with thor i like seeing him again i really liked him
in ragnarok it was nice to see him again yeah um it's just that it's a bit clouded by how i feel
about thor as a whole you know yeah and the fucking yeah and the fortnite thing i forgot
to mention he says something like i'm gonna stick something up your butt and i was like
but he couldn't say ass i gotta say butt i'm disappointed that nick theory didn't get one line
yeah he shows up at the very end and he's like where have you been did you have you could have
helped uh sort of like done something or for the battle could you have called somebody or done
something or oh i just wanted to hear him say fuck one time in the mcu that was literally it tony
stark was one bad motherfucker like like of all the things all the movies that he should have said
it it should have been this one or infinity imagine if steward would have been if he had
turned up in the final fight just running forward and shooting his pistol would have been like why
are you here uh gamora got snapped by tony hold up back to uh wait the the this the super chat
what was the super chat i'm not doing them yet but unless it's one you wanted before you know
i said something i don't i don't know scroll up yeah go find it well you have the list mine only
goes back so far i have no idea there's a few of them rags you realize rags there's been like 300
super chats i don't know which one you're referring to what whatever we were reading before i said
something we don't know i don't know you read it how is that your how is that i wasn't reading
super chat i was reading questions then what was the question which one i've read four you were
saying right before i said something that we didn't really answer uh the one oh so how long
until we get big brain videos about how objectively endgame was terrible thus tlj was amazing and
objectively better than endgame jab videos at maulock you know that's gonna happen so you see
it wasn't that hard to just get the question to read it again i had no idea what you're referring
to super chat yeah well i thought we were that's what we were doing no so you made a mistake that's
okay no that chat was really super uh yeah well the thing is objectively speaking it still ranks
higher than tlj because it actually takes care of a decent chunk of characters um it gives the
protagonist of the mcu probably the best ending you can give him so yeah like i don't understand
how you could possibly argue like compare luke's journey to iron man's oh my god different planes
in terms of quality um yeah gamora got snapped by tony uh we don't we don't know for sure that
happened no i don't well theory would be the tony snapped all of the bad men and maybe gamora
counted because she was still in the art i don't know i would assume that she's not snapped and
the guardian three will be about trying to find her i don't know
all right then uh did you guys talk about the rat yeah we did um women yep nebula live when
she killed part of us how does nebula live when she killed her past self she killed an alternate
timeline version of herself that is that is it right uh-huh yeah supposedly um how does cap return
the tesseract back to the box i have no idea well how the way he returns to all these things i
don't know how it all goes um got a couple of tweets to go through as well uh what happened
to peggy's children and husband uh i guess the idea is that her husband the whole time was cap
unless he's literally just invaded it and now erased those and then there's the question of did
he kiss his own niece or whatever baron carter how's that work and i guess he didn't care about
sharon carter really are there did he make super soldier babies that's another thing that works
that's gonna be a quite good delivery um avengers assemble was pretty cool what he said that yep
this is cool yeah uh parallel between peter and tony's deaths i suppose you could you could
definitely draw but they have the reverse both scenes i guess would you marry brie larson hmm
rags would you like to answer that oh god no she sounds like a terrible person
there you go like out of out of the movie she seemed like brie larson seems like an awful person
you're just sexist dude you wouldn't say that if it was thor i'd rather marry nebula
she'd probably kill me but at least it wouldn't be annoying
in a twitter and prep as well so many things to do guys help with the things uh even if time travel
makes sense still bad because it shittily explained i mean this is kind of my conclusion
on it right now is that um this it's so hard to follow in the movie as well that it's just
like we're in trouble um what about the toady stock axe body spray product placement
actually highly recommend oh i didn't oh right no yeah yeah and that's weird i didn't see it
as product placement i was just like yeah i he seems like the type who would yeah because you
know that you notice it on people like if it was a product placement then why would they
maybe be making fun of it oh yeah how would the duck was in the fight did you guys see that
i didn't he was he had a gun and everything yeah i don't remember this how are the duck movie when
oh i can't wait for him to be in guardians three was he in the background or yeah he's just he's
easy to miss i think uh i've seen screenshots where he's uh however did you talk about how
thor's friends are still alive even though phantoms blew up thor's ship in infinity war
he blew up half of their ship the other half somehow made it to earth we did talk about that
though yeah it's not explained loki's obviously loki's gonna get a tv show to explain what happened
to him i think um oh yeah i love you 3000 in cheeseburgers i liked both of those things
oh god fuck yeah yeah oh my god i love you 3000 i fucking balled like a small child oh my god
i love you jesus fucking christ this movie but were you crying as hard as the guy who
cried over the episode nine trailer no i kept myself together like i kept composed but
my face was a mess uh i was like this there's a child sitting next to me and he just he couldn't
he doesn't understand how much this means to me i thought of the kids reactions to tony i was quite
sad with as well she looked she looked she had the right face on of like sad face concerned
and it was just like oh man even though he only saw those two for very brief it was just like the
idea of it all very uh very sad um but yeah i think we've pretty much covered most of this
so i'm gonna skip ahead to the next thing we're supposed to be doing here um
um yeah so there's just two infinitable things one i thought was amusing the other one um
it's just a take from somebody that i didn't expect so is everybody in the watch together
yeah yeah citing um let me let me close my interstellar marines tab
you still had that up it was uh it was just a tab on hello oh no stop it this isn't what i wanted
to see oh my god is that what he looks like my god he looks even worse without the beard i think
yeah i think it might have been a compensation beard like because this is the word this is
oh my god quinton i can't believe i'm saying this grow the beard back out man this is really
fugly look for you i think he said he was going uh
of course he is look at that ah this is horrifying oh i thought this was gonna be a meme and then
well though this is something he says that i thought was really funny so he hasn't seen
he hasn't seen captain bobble uh apparently and so this is his take on captain bobble from this
movie i just thought this was a music it's like also i don't want to be mean and i i don't want
people to get the wrong idea but in captain marvel standalone movie is she like uh interesting
or funny or cool or uh fun to be around she ain't any of that in this movie neither are you
no i'm not trying to not trying to be a downer but it's just like i've watched your scenes
and she has this mansplainy vibe that's the only way i can explain it it's like a mansplain she
has a mansplainy vibe what's interesting way to put it what the fuck is a mansplain i agree with
quinton she does have a mansplainy vibe what does that mean though you know how the women who
bitch captain marvel's whole movie was essentially um at least her backstory you know as men were
putting her down and saying she couldn't do stuff and trying to keep her down and all that stuff
there's a lot of girl power stuff mansplaining is one of those things that like women say all the
time like bitchy women i'll always say and she puts out that bitch vibe in a way that i think is
is accurate to say she puts out a mansplaining do you mean like condescending or uh yeah yeah
yeah that's what yeah mansplaining is extremely condescending i just i don't know why people are
using the word isn't mansplaining just when a man explains something well no it's the people who
use mansplaining at all like if somebody legitimately uses mansplaining as an actual term
of a thing that happens you know what you're getting into all right well
well nice wolf uh
okay and then so that the other take is a twitter one that i thought was a mute oh yeah
so this is i'll send you all through uh the chat and then obviously people will see it yeah
yeah so h palmer guy was talking about how the plot doesn't make sense with shawn on twitter
and he said in response to people no but it's actually very deep that the character motivations
make no sense was the defense of thanos in the last movie so i assume you can slot that one in
here whatever it's a film for small children i hope they enjoy it he uh he got blasted for this
by his fan base i thought it was really funny because i was like oh man i thought he was on
you know not this team the whole everything's like you everyone could enjoy everything but he
ended up deleting this tweet um because i guess the people didn't take it very well people don't
have any consistency and they just say smug shit to be all like you have to put other people down
and he followed up with this i don't know if you want to read this out ranks
hello i am film discourse dog i have a diploma in talking about films using my smart boy brain
i have discovered that it is okay to like a film but also also okay for people to criticize
problems with it and no one is a bad person for doing either of those things i love you
that's our thing i thought that was our thing yeah that's what we do how come we're villains
for it and when he says it it's like i okay and then he follows up with uh the next one because
yeah um
you know i'll just read it well it's just here we go i have seen many fellow scholars repeat the
notion hating a popular thing doesn't make you cool and while this is true i find that it is more
useful to either take people's criticism seriously instead of being dismissive like this or just move
on with your life mainstream things deserve criticism okay i was so confused i was like um
all right i guess i agree with this yeah but i thought that he disagreed with this
all right these are slimy people who don't have consistency yeah confusing to say the least but
that's why he deletes tweets people don't like and then substitutes them with shit that they will
um and so next up is just a cavalcade of of uh memes for us to to get through these are gonna be
relatively amusing i suppose i would hope but uh this is one this is a guy who's trying to draw
i think pictures like pear stream and you started doing them so this is this is just one of them i
like that i have long arms um detail bad then rag is with his eyes
that wolf you're just i think you're just gonna eat something i don't know why they didn't put
a pizza in there but i mean oh yeah well if the pizza is implied they already ate the pizza
i showed fringy this and he liked it i thought this was pretty cool
so
froggled croak not today sir
he's good sheets i like it this one's really weird that's all i'm going to say i don't know
what to make of it it was on twitter
hello wolf no i will never watch the lord of the rings not as long as i have milk to be squeezed
through my right
all right i i don't know what to make of jay's head coming out at the top
or the horn rather fuck um that's an odd one good all right this is the next one which again
is quite an interesting one for details i see you're taking inter what does that say intercultural
oh intercultural communications uh fuck branding branding brandings and marketing
luxury and french yes sir and you are also a follower of tonalism in the milk
milk salamic faith very interesting i'm assuming the first and last comments are from us as a board
the little ones from him that you got blessed pipeman has his donuts you have your pizza jay
has a copy of arrival next to him and lord of the rings is stacked i'm assuming that's for
wolf and his pizza yeah then rags has got the holy meemble the new testament am i drunk i think
yeah that's your that's your hand you're coming from the floor grabbing another beer i'm not an
alcoholic there have been a couple moments in previous streams people have assumed it rags
how would they i am i am definitely not an alcoholic i believe bayouin made this one
oh boy boy oh this is different from the usual you get tits and you get tits you all get tits
bayouin what the fuck is it with you and tits uh nothing that's that would be it
we all get tits the uh the same guy who did the first one i guess still longman no no riser skywalk
uh this was actually being used for like reactions on twitter i've seen it a couple of times i just
like it then um someone made a stage on i guess the new super smash bros let me call it efap
we have such uh such patient advance our fans have too much time on their hands just a platform
that's a lot of milk
oh my god he's like uh you know how in far cry there's those traveling dudes
uh that you can buy shit from oh yeah i got one of these yeah this one's a gas mask variant for
cj rags and wolf i would assume now we can all be gas masks gasmen gasmen exactly so this is you
need a gasman you need a gas mask if you're a part of a toxic brood i believe the artist is
intending to make anime visions of us that is ragged fashionably a woman again what does my
caller say mark but oh okay oh yeah the uh the credit i think everyone else is a man except for me
this just in from twitter i thought it was funny they said i fixed it
it is an improvement at least uh fucking hell discord won't let me change my profile picture
back i'm stuck as quinton go wait yeah wolf they've doubled for you as well i guess i'm next uh
oh so we're all women we're all the women's at least i'm attractive that's mine what does
that say wow you're saying rags is ugly all right okay i got it sorry rags you're kind of ugly
my dog lady is fucking super hot yeah so she's got shitty hair um no yeah you're you've got shitty
hair i have better hair than you i want oh mine's great i want you to see this with our context what
the fuck um why are you being strangled by a pineapple man so uh jay put out a tweet saying
he thinks that pineapple on pizza is like only hated for the meme and that's not really hated
that much for any particular reason and then i said that um fuck i'll try and find my tweet
on twitter work with me how do i have to just scroll oh yeah there you go i said i was attacked
by a pineapple in 03 he told me he needed help moving a piano and he said i simply believed him
i never will so he drew that i guess um we got we got a good old normal fucking meme here
this is really we get like a movie poster but you know makes sense i like the the fucking i don't
know if they did it on purpose but the name is being out of order is like yeah pretty sure that's
how the original poster actually goes so hey when they do that fucking oh yeah this was the uh
i guess this would have tied with the super chat but you already knew but hey yeah good detail
i got you i love that he fucking censored the tits with mauler
this one's also maulers everywhere oh yeah i love this one
in my opinion this is really good i love this so much
i love that like jay is the manager of efap
i love this so much um this is so good yeah like everyone's happy
i think right this one as well yes one's great no one's ever really oh god
oh jesus christ
and then this is just a neat drawing you know why not throw it into the rotation
i like it it's cool yeah who knows where that one will go um this one see i've forgotten the
context behind them so i just want to make sure i collect and show them um but holy shit you know
it's like oh wow what's going on he's autistic like he's my gardener and i'm looking at him
through the window he's taking a taking a deserved break a refreshment god this is intimidating
um that this one i actually looked at this for a while because i was trying to figure it out
it is uh wolf's pizza drone on the schematic fucking pizza drone now just like gramatics so
you have the box and then in the next stage is that like is the box opening up or is the pizza
taken out of the box and put into something i'm trying to figure it out exactly i think that no
the pizza lifts up from the top and the bottom of the box separates from the top of the box
uh-huh it forms a table oh my god and then it like has a crown as well
someone make this for me please and i won't have to go buy my pizza or
oh my god um
um fucking lord it's the crying dude from the video oh boy
oh does he got that big fucking weird watch on his face i think so yeah yeah he does see the
little thing on his oh yeah yeah he does now we just gotta imagine that his wife's getting
railed behind him as as his lore oh shit this one's really good i forgot about this one so it's
like uh a representation so i was on cj and and the great british podcast and we joked about how
once we get the crossover we'll have britain versus america being that i would join their team
god save the queen next chromosome just like the spider's foretold oh yeah you're even in there
yeah and look he's trying to tempt you to eat him he's putting chocolate on it he's trying to kill you
oh i get it yeah you gotta love the er caveat
i'm not sure what they're implying with uh fuck i guess you just don't like cj
america fuck yeah beautiful stuff
i don't even know the context it's just funny it's great bless him hypeman yeah and so this is
the other uh another artist interested in doing an anime version i guess jesus christ god damn i
look good rags me fringy um kind of pictures is that j in the bottom right i think so yeah but
what's different um so who are the ones up top i'm not i guess top right i guess top right is
i think top middle is cj oh pizza man oh yeah would pikeman be top left then i don't know
i don't know who that is might be pikeman maybe is the the way she's dressed the white hair yeah
maybe i think it's pikeman um and then because art comes in all shapes and sizes
i like the idea because i'm pretty sure it's the paper you'd use in maths right like this
they drew that in class took a picture of it and they sent it
i can't remember if rag saw this or not yet but it's amazing
oh keep trying to defend that epic game story
steve has media
can i zoom in steam has cloud saves these
steam has medias just a idea at the end just a quality list i have seen it and i really like it
yeah that's awesome so this happened i'm assuming all three of you are aware of it
oh yes yeah oh yeah um he pissed off so many fans
yeah fuck what sequel trilogy fans think holy moly no my god um what a take i honestly though
if i was like in box house when he did it i'd be like dude you realize what you're doing when you
put that up right like i know how he feels about all this shit but holy moly lark is just screaming
inside and he just had to do this so many people like uh got pissed i'm pretty sure he put out like
a partial apology or at least like a recognition that didn't mean sorry my idea is better i saw i
think it was like the top comment i don't know if it still is the top comment um where it was like
you know this is just gaslighting for the alt right oh yeah the the black man driving the ship
is that's where we're at guys for the alt right that's where we're at but this is this is this is
directly connected to the alt right like okay oh that's something mark is one of us i've come
actually um before before we forget we have to ask er that's what i was about to say yeah um so er
who do you think because i know you're incredibly invested in star wars and that you cannot wait to
see episode nine who do you think is the character that will be the most inconsistent with everything
that's come before um in episode nine uh but apart from lando and kylo because we feel like
those two are too obvious as choices uh hmm can i not go with palpatine oh you can definitely
go with palpatine we were in a way that was a choice but now it is so well there you go
since i have no idea where they're going with that say you can say palpatine you could say
general grievous count duku oh wait are we supposed to disqualify should we disqualify
no go for it if that's what you want to say but we we disqualified lando because we didn't factor
him in if you know what i mean so technically because to be honest with you guys i probably
would avoid palpe if what do you reckon i would have chose palpatine if i knew yeah i think we're
gonna have to otherwise it doesn't make sense okay so apart from kylo lando and palpey
well who's that really even weird so yeah finpo hux ray luke bb8 r3d2 player
b3po uh well okay then luke because i have no idea what they would do with him
from this point forward we're in good company we got weekend warrior and metal and ran reviews
voted for luke there you go all right see who's gonna who else how that's gonna take
um but yeah i thought this was just overall hilarious and that everyone nuts over it and
he actually i believe he apologized he put out something to sort of uh rectify it quote unquote
get mark hamill on efap i mean i'd be on board if you can finally get him to tell us the truth
about the last jedi so back to the um i i'm hoping you guys have seen this video but it doesn't
matter we're totally gonna watch it go back and watch together this is this is star wars related
um this is this is a thing that happened and i know that the second i set it up
you guys are gonna be like oh you might know what it is so the guy who voices acbar now
no way i've seen this he was talking during the star wars celebration uh he may have said some
stuff that uh was not appreciated oh i think he showed the there we go um so here it is acbar
now i've been acbar for about six years and uh so it's a forest moon of endor woman it's a trap
i'm probably gonna have to pause it every once in a while as well but yeah you know all power to
the forward shield and i was i like the idea that someone out there's just like yeah they
fucked you over didn't they carry on he's not really thrilled about how they blew him out the
side of a ship i'm like i'm like i who's this holdo woman nobody
knows there's no no one's invested in who is she
thank you acbar oh i know man i know exactly what that feel what this is like oh god shut him up
he's going off script i think he does shut him up yeah he definitely
look at his fucking face right there he looks like he's like how do i go from this
he's like i shouldn't have let this happen
uh acbar knows what's up let's just real quick let's talk about clone wars
i love that people were fucking clapping too hell yeah yeah people yeah let's stop talking about
your character let's talk about something completely unrelated um oh yeah i just thought
that was glorious i guess um we're the legend you don't give a fuck since you're here do you
want to what's your take on anything in relation to episode nine er i'm assuming you're not looking
forward to it uh well i mean i'm looking forward to it in the sense to be the last one that i'm
gonna have to watch are you like us where we're like i'm like curious yeah i just want to see the
dumpster fire well there's a part of me that's legitimately interested in what exactly he's going
to do acbar palpatine palpatine's back i can't wait for ray to fucking kill palpatine yay
she was the chosen one all along if see this is the you jump to that it's like that's not going
to happen that i'm like oh they've done just as bad so like it was far as hope being like
wasn't powerful enough to defeat you but i am
they better call him sheave at least once in the movie creamy sheave i think is the way to go
someone better like scream sheave at the top of their lungs she she's pal haplatine
anyway uh yeah i you know it'll be fun to see how much of a disaster it is but you're hoping to
just fuck off after that i'm assuming you don't watch any other star wars yes um what is the same
way after episode nine it's like fuck star wars i don't want anything more to do with it what if
they like had episode 10 they were like the the original cast is coming back no no they they've
already fucked it up enough like a hearted luke will be reading it's like oh my god what you have
kerry fissure on like strings they literally dig out her corpse yeah they prop her up they just
they just put cocaine into her corpse reanimator i don't blame you though like stars is a disaster
but i have to see how it ends i'm so it's such an interesting uh comparison to ed game because it's
like oh i have to see how it ends versus i have to see how it ends yeah fucking good stuff um well
it's like in-game left me almost in the really satisfied because they could have oh god they
could have fucked it up so much but star wars did star wars is like well i mean can you make this
good at all well then game it's the answer is no this one is can you make it good we could just
have a scene where palpatine kills all of the sequel trilogy characters and that would make
me a little happier um yeah i'd be on board if palpatine kills somebody that would make me much
more um oh you are my apprentice no ray ray needs to die let everyone else survive except for ray
they're not gonna give us that dude they're not gonna give us that i know they're not but it's
it's something i can dream of so this is something that um uh you guys know filthy frank at all
well then yeah so someone made an edit where like he's doing characters and they've put labels on
them to represent the people from efap i guess so um do you think
would you like more teas and biscuits with that hold on to your niggas
there was nothing like tea and a good but
i don't even get it
oh you want to take the light on the magic to cap it
you know won't sing material now won't sing material now
do you like mine i just like the kangaroo still free apple pie wrestling
hello governor yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
sorghum's just not even there
i'm gonna
look at these ten crazy tattoos you won't believe number
where is that a sky
what did the chat say hey
hey bits you want to get a load of this
so then we move on to uh there's a stream where uh a certain story of goliath was
i'm gonna release a video for efap so that the fads of efap can get caught up but if
you missed this stream this won't make much sense but we're gonna like it a lot
fucking cosmic chicken yeah this is uh is it hard on jay's channel yeah this is
the third one i think i think so the shittiest one they're all shitty i think a lot of people love
that movie you're gonna wolf carefully you'll piss everyone off
i think regs is gonna piss more people off than i did
that's probably i'm sorry that i'm sorry that these movies are bad
i'm sorry 500 xp bounty on cynics
that was a fun stream it was yeah
this is uh by the way this is made this is made by bayouin and someone else i believe
there's two people but together i'm not 100 sure and there's a few of them goliath has
i don't know where he is
ison goliath
what a strange coincidence the exact moment i tried to defend myself i think goal goes wrong
artificial barriers blockage
for reference er totaled is doing a film of game review there's a wall and he says there's many
artificial barriers of blockage
he's on another plane of intelligence and the rest of us one day i only hope to be half as
wise as tonald please come on the show we would love it everyone would love it
tonald has forgotten more than any of us could ever remember
so this is this is speaks for itself um you're gonna be able to see a lot of bayouin art
once er good luck with your eyes on this this may sound a little sitting in a room going
no he's he's reacting to efap memes is what he's doing oh god speaking of which er have you seen
this video this dude oh yeah yeah we've all seen and you hate it because you can't capture that
same wonder that that poor man does and you shouldn't don't criticize the poor man he's
all out of jealousy yep yeah basically someone someone make that video make that video
it's just a just a bayouin art compilation do it yeah i guess this is the guy who does the videos
we've passed on all we know
oh
morris
uh
oh
it's meditius
now has the rights of like the west jedi yeah that's probably one of my favorites for just
like hey yeah can you guess the context for a john adams spider writing in the bill of rights or
whatever with the with the palantia for the hatebogger that talks it's it's it's it's an art
it's an art yeah i can't even begin
i think that was the first bit of bayouin art we ever saw yeah i think so
i didn't realize i was fucking praying in that picture
pirate tool oh my god emperor tonal it's possible
and you might need to make an emperor tone now
how do they make this more and more epic
how do they make this more and more epic every time that'd be good
there you go it's an actual real representation i'm sure the chat is happy
well that is a question but i'm really afraid to know the answer but i feel like i have to
do all right then oh this one is it's called orphans i kind of remember what this one
oh i feel bad for any orphans that might be watching this i don't always bother dude i've
checked out demographics on youtube efab is like majority orphan content oh that's great
do you think bayouin's an orphan yes everybody is
it's okay bayouin we'll adopt you we can't love you but we will adopt you
i think that actually might be the whole video
is this song copyrighted by the way the because i hear it everywhere
um i don't know let's hope not but yeah
uh this is again from bayouin could you choose efap now this is the one that oh god is this
the one with the school certainly requested this one i chose efap because they had a wide variety
of classes that i found interesting the art at efap is very unique it's something that you know
that is true and i think that's the special part something that you wouldn't be able to feel
anywhere else and i think it's a way to pull it it's more than i could have expected
and the people here at efap are so welcoming and extremely helpful
and i would recommend it to every single person that wanted to come here
there you go this is an ad for efap is perfect oh wait did i have a cover on that whole time no
i didn't work good but yeah um these are all nice and quick these are good
this is mauler's bizarre adventure torture of a massive from blivitch
torture of a massive i believe it's anime
uh so eo what anime is this jojo oh there you go i have no idea
oh
apparently i'm a trap in several animes i don't know if you can translate because i have no idea
what's happened i cannot i have not watched this far oh spoilers
okay
oh yeah i haven't seen jojo i haven't seen a lot of animes i'm pretty much on rags's level
i've seen like six seven something like i saw all the good ones they made 10 years ago and nothing
since is it gonna be the lore now that i'm a trap um
i don't know if i want to understand what's happening
we seem to be talking joseph anderson apparently joseph anderson's on dmt
the funny thing is like this actually would have taken time to actually edit so
there you go oh that's really good
oh
this is lord of the snacks the fellowship of the street
i'll be pausing through this one a bunch as well i imagine oh boy
oh god i think i know what this is going to be now is this is it balrog is goliath that's why it's
gotta be
what is this you definitely
hey i'm eric going i figured they'd make you
oh that's goliath
i can't wait for the super cut
uh
respect
yeah i'm happy to be gandalf that's cool with me
oh that's so good that scream was so good with the life in the alleyway and the dogs barking
i like we were all inside of our cozy first world home
out there in an alleyway surrounded by
so this is a weird one uh we haven't done this in a while i mean the last one i think was robot head
but um there's a video i found that i really like and i'm pretty much just going to play the whole
thing it's only four minutes but i'm pretty sure all of us are gonna like this especially chat uh
with how things are going channel called j rag i'll do um channel link in the chat once we've
watched the video this video is called uh this is a video essay um so yeah uh enjoy this is a video
essay it has all the intellectual satisfaction as an actual academic essay but without any of that
tough thinking stuff you normally need to do when parsing a difficult argument and this is where i
make my opening point it reminds me of leafy separate my points with title cards that last
about three seconds longer than they should although i think that was uh the content cop
intro so yeah that's content cop yeah yeah oh it probably reminds me of leafy because yeah
that makes sense actually yeah because he did one on a leafy
excerpt of the song whose artist i didn't ask permission to use while the title card was on
the screen never mind that you already lost interest in what i was saying who cares i'm
speaking to you informally doesn't this feel intimate doesn't this feel personal doesn't this
trick your brain into thinking you finally have a friend because you do have a friend now i'm that
cool wise funny friend you've always wanted in your life but never found because you spent all
your time watching video essays look at this editing fluid precise oh wait this is just footage
of a nerd writer video but you don't care and neither does youtube here's some stock footage
i got it from looking up stock footage on google look here's some people walking around here's a
bird a giraffe who shot this who cares some of the footage is licensed and requires credit but the
only copyright youtube cares about is songs and full videos so you can steal smaller videos if
you want and give no credit to them whatsoever who cares about how ethical the media you consume is
it makes the entertainment neurons fire in your brain i could have stolen this footage off a man
whose entire life was spent culminating into this one beautiful shot and all he ever wanted was a
credit link to his instagram page in the description of this youtube video and i won't give it to him
why because i'm a sadistic youtuber who only cares about that sweet sweet new count like and subscribe
bitches i feel like that's probably copyright you'll notice my second point isn't really that
different from my first point if you think hard enough about it but i'm not concerned with that
because first of all you won't think hard enough and second because these overly long title cards
will make you assume i'm arguing entirely different points between these sections when in reality i
just didn't organize my thoughts very well at all and then put these title cards up to make you
think that i had here's some data in an academic essay i would be citing my sources here so you
could fact check what i'm saying but i think i'll just leave it up to you to decide whether i'm
lying or not but if anyone calls me out on this i think i'll just say i was misremembering the
data what are people gonna do give me a failing grade the worst i'll get is a comment on the video
saying that i was lying and who's gonna see that 15 people most people don't consume content
intellectually we don't have time to fact check everything that's said so we end up believing a
bunch of garbage we prize entertainment over information because that's what we've come to
expect from the things we consume no wonder when we get into arguments we end up using a bunch of
faulty information we have remember from some video we were barely paying attention to five months ago
i made a typo in that slide i don't care you don't care here's some shots of that anime you like
oh yeah i know you like these visuals i didn't do any work for them and i'm not even directly
commenting on them but they just thematically go with what i'm saying you know but now it's time
for the bridge of this video essay where i address straw man counter arguments only an idiot would
say and then expertly refute them you know why ronald's points up myself proving that i'm an
all-knowing all-powerful intellectual force one might ask are video essays really the worst thing
ever created in the history of mankind no they can actually help to illustrate complex points
visually and can make topics appeal to those that would normally be inaccessible through
a regular essay i don't read academic essays but i regularly consume video essays they are really
only as lazy as the people making them but watching a video essay doesn't make you smart most are
poorly researched most when you over with visuals or actual facts and the sounds and visuals are
often stolen without credit a lot aren't even that well edited and way too many focus on the
analysis of the same dang things now i've reached my conclusion you don't fully understand how i got
to this conclusion but your brain is telling you that you understand my argument you might even
repeat this argument to others confident you know what the fuck you're talking about you will think
that you're somewhere even close to grasping the full complexity of whatever i just dumbed down
into this five minute video you're wrong but you don't care you just feel like you're right
and that's what's important because at the end of the day this isn't a textbook this isn't an
academic paper this is a neatly packaged idea to make you feel smart this is a video essay
hmm i think it pretty much sums it up oh yeah man this guy get this guy an e-fap
he probably hates them as much as we do but who knows if he actually thinks that some of
the stuff that we do isn't very you know that could be a thing you never know um yeah just
wait till he does one on us we're all video essayists right are we i don't know
i don't think so the essay is implied
oh the essay is implied yeah so this is a link i'm gonna put it in the in the chat go check out his
channel if you thought that was uh interesting and eye-opening as toward a video essay say hi from
e-fap on his video as well if you want so that he doesn't feel like we're uh um you know bullying
doesn't feel like we're uh um you know bullying or something because you know things just you know
things oh i like that yeah bully man bad no um i figured since you know we're pretty much
there's only one last thing i was really thinking of showing to uh to people here today um it's an
it's an age-old question i think that we've all considered i know that um i know did yeah i just
i'm just gonna come out with it i did kora is better than ang wouldn't you guys agree
and so i wanted to prove you guys that's true with uh with a video essay it is a real video
oh man i half thought you were kidding why kora is better is a better avatar than ang
the legend of kora right i'm excited
more often than not if you ask someone which is better avatar the last airbender or the legend of
kora they'll immediately say the last airbender or they'll just slap you in the face for even asking
such a question yes i mean what's the comparison right the last airbender beautifully handles
multiple themes from acceptance and forgiveness to rage and vengeance well i'm here to tell you
that the legend of kora is no pushover i might even go as far as to say that kora is a better
avatar than ang okay well you've gone way too far then haven't you hold on i can already see you
smashing the dislike button just give me a minute so yeah yeah give a minute jesus god okay all right
or a few minutes depending on how long the video is personality appeal is completely subjective
chances are you grew up on the last airbender and it helped you understand complicated concepts
through ang's eyes so you feel comfortable with his behavior therefore i can see why anyone would
hate kora she's blunt aggressive and headstrong the complete antithesis of ang but there's
something you should what do you what do you think about that i think he's being a little
generous but you know i'm gonna give him a chance just a slight chance not a bear understand
she's written that way on purpose it'll be redundant so we can see
she's written that way on purpose oh and then just accidentally write a character
whoops turns out our characters headstrong i guess that's how it's gonna be no he just
accidentally wrote her that yeah it totally makes sense that shares all the elements of
the predecessor kora has mastery of multiple elements at a young age ang has to learn each
other no it makes sense because she was written to be that way okay over a period of time kora has
no aptitude for spirituality from birth ang is raised as a monk and meditation is embedded into
his core being kora is one of many girls from the water tribe ang is a young boy and the last living
airbender the creators even went as far as altering the attention given to their relationship with
their respective animal companion apa and naga apa is seen as a staple in team avatar both
physically and mentally each member has a set purpose the three benders deterring the enemy
combatants saka is the tactician and apa is their mode of transportation and support the
fire nation has an ever-expanding grip on the world we're introduced to branching from private
islands to public transportation for the entirety of you this is such surface level shit yeah
he's just doing good things substantive not a thing i mean what okay okay it's like the characters
are different yeah i'm waiting for what he brings in kora if he's gonna like it makes sense because
this is this and i haven't seen either of these so this is like yeah me and me and rags are judging
this from an outsider perspective yeah constantly apa provides this there are various instances where
team avatar is outnumbered and overpowered so he needs to escape ang wants to run from zuko
hop on apa ang wants to run from azula hop on apa this is why the absence of apa not only
cripples the team mentally but physically what instead of riding him for an effortless trip to
bossing say they have to take hazardous and unreliable detours kora on the other hand is
a no medium yes i mean the other that makes sense that they would do that so here being
the only one of her enemies that tried to detain her with that being said there's no need for naga's
presence to be as essential as operas not to mention them this is a strange why is he focusing
on their um their um i don't know if they both animal companion yeah it seems focusing on them
but okay animal yeah it's a little strange i guess he's just starting out with them well kora doesn't
have momo so she's objectively worse yeah yeah it's true in the passing years if kora were in
dying need of transportation she could steal a car or airship and flee the area this difference
may seem inconsequential but it has far-reaching ripple effects in the story on an emotional it's
true just how do you think before are attached being some of the last remnants of the air nomad
civilization they comfort each other for ang especially apa's presence is a necessity since
multiple air temples were attacked and destroyed ang treasures the few mementos he has of his people
this is presented no clearer than when he's arguing my core is better right yeah all right um okay then
like how is uh i'm following his argument and concluding that ang is better i'm just i guess
we'll let him work cork and just steal a car core is better what is the same bettors that
kidnapped she can throw a car into a building and cause a lot of destruction and that is nothing
that is called likability wolf and treasures the few mementos he has of his people this is presented
no clearer than when he threatens to send bettors that kidnapped opera becoming consumed with rage
and entering the avatar state at this point in the story ang has no control over the avatar state
only entering it in a hostile environment or for survival purposes roku himself tells ang that the
avatar state is a defense mechanism gifted only to the avatar it can then be inferred that ang
cherishes apa's existence so much that he internalizes an attack against apa as an attack against himself
kora's relationship with naga doesn't have nearly as much significance all right seriously
why is he focusing on this part like i'm very convinced that uh ang is better at this point
services some strong arguments in favor of him kora has multiple sources to return to for reference
about her heritage not only are her parents still at her disposal but the entire idea of
the southern water tribe this dilutes the importance of kora and naga's relationship
oh there's her animal okay all right kora's better by diluting her i okay all right then is this
is this is this video gonna end with him saying yeah so kora is absolutely worse is this a bait
yeah it seems like it i could believe it nothing more if she wants to revisit her water tribe
roots she can simply go home the misconception here is that there's a problem with their difference
in sense of mentality ang links apa's presence oh he has some she has none i was about to say i
could be interpreted as a problem i suppose because he has no other point of reference
while kora can't look at naga's anything more than animal companion because of the existence of all
her other cultural references the writers want you to view the world from a different perspective
and math was 97's video about why people hate board so oh my god he's doing the fucking video
essay thing we just saw yeah it's pretty funny too i don't know but so the logic is you see it
as better in with ang and um the animal companion because we've shown a different perspective in
kora in that there isn't really a connection but it totally makes sense narratively why there
isn't one therefore it's i don't that's just an argument for why it happened not an argument for
why it's good yeah i really don't get what he's going for like if someone preferred to watch
avengers endgame then a video of me eating cereal in my house for two hours i'd be like well i was
hungry it must be if you're eating cereal for two hours i was just a slow eater but yeah so i'm just
like it makes sense but doesn't mean it's entertaining i don't fucking know people hate
boratope because he's not a new version of naruto never considering that maybe he isn't supposed to
being pretty is that why they hate him oh shit is he doing the tlj argument where he's like you
didn't get what you wanted you wanted fancivus you wanted to see luke jumping around he's like
he's asserting something that is the reason for something else and i have no idea i don't
maruto or boruto yeah i have no idea about boruto so i'm like okay i'll just i assume he's just
drawing there's like the fucking viewers they always want to see the same thing again but this
was a new thing it's like because new things can't be shit it's been through therefore he
acts how a neglected child would and being isolated from the outside world from a young age
makes kora ignorant to how much she still needs to learn as the avatar many viewers see kora's
actions as baffling because she is an ang wasn't slate that ang was stuck in a big fucking ice
cube for a hundred years yeah he's got a little bit of a he's got a little bit more of a you know
isolation issue than kora does yeah a little more reason to be a gigantic cunt
no that's what strong team of characters are they're fucking cunts yeah
captain marvel's nailing it like it's the model okay as the avatar many viewers see kora's actions
as baffling because she hasn't given the clean slate that ang does even though her team doesn't
have a clean slate i'm confused as to what he means by clean slate me too i i can't even
i just can't even for instance the both take actions that affect the world on a global scale
with tremendous outcomes ang stops the hundred-year war he defeats osai during sultan's comment
against insurmountable odds breaking the fire of his tyrannical whole entire world and returning
it to a relative era if ever i watch these shows i think i'm gonna forget about all these things
so it'll be fine of peace likewise kora also ushers in a new era of harmony by merging the
human and the spirit world stopping one except it wasn't very harmonious not was it okay i mean i
would sure how is it not yeah well i mean it only just starts it's too much to go into but basically
yeah too much to go into it's not harmonious let's just put it like that oh my god i forgot about
the fucking carpet spirits wait is that what these two are the clothes what the red one is
the red one is the dark spirit batu oh that's the carpet dude yeah why does he look like that
instead of a carpet because the writer's the dark avatar it is the just goofiest thing imaginable i
just anyway spreading chaos and reinventing the status quo of their society in this sense they
both achieve the avatar's core goal of maintaining peace with that being said while their achievements
are no small feat i do think the amount of obstacles kora encounters opposed to ang are vastly
understated after being freed from the iceberg ang is the prophesied savior the world has been
waiting for making he and his team welcome in the homes of those oppressed by the fire nation's
on various occasions he's expected to intervene and solve discrepancies only on the sole notion
of being the avatar his judgment is seen as infallible or a force beyond one's own understanding
being able to retain his autonomy allows ang to avoid jumping through hurdles when wanting to get
something done that's not to say there are a few times where government authority ignores his
perspective but there might how's that like all the pressure on the world on his shoulder he's
making it out like this is you know helpful i don't want to hear that in a way that argument
is strange to intervene and solve discrepancies only on the sole notion of being the avatar his
judgment is seen as infallible or a force beyond one's own understanding being able to retain his
autonomy allows ang to avoid jumping through hurdles when wanting to get something done
he doesn't have to jump through hurdles when he wants something done because everybody
sees him as infallible outside of when they do that's not even really true i mean people
like there are plenty of characters that view him as kind of like a traitor because he's
disappeared for a hundred years while this war is raged on so does he find himself making difficult
choices because i don't know i guess because does everyone do what he says basically because
that's kind of what's implied by what he just no not really no that's not to say there are a few
times where government authority ignores his perspective but they're minute compared to the
vast number of times someone says this i'm here with the avatar he's the bridge between our worlds
he'll vouch for me the owl wasn't really on board that but okay what are you saying he cut
context to make his point better we've never experienced that but once they find out on the
avatar i don't normally play this card but i'm the avatar conversely chorus don't want time and time
again by uncooperative institutions or unreasonable governments she doesn't manage to get she pretty
consistently wrong though i mean it's true that they put up a lot of cunts against her country but
but i'm the sole merit of just being the avatar some may say this skepticism is warranted
a result of her young age and impulsive nature but still being a chosen one so to speak should
offer some leeway she is further restrained by a complacent general public causing unfavorable
poll numbers something that veers off from where the avatar's duty is supposed to be
maintaining peace core has to converse with different personalities to find a common solution
whereas ang simply swoops in to save the day knowing his goal is to simply tear down an
oppressive government this is how core you agree with that uh he's being extremely generous here
he's going straight to book three the book that people like to make his points is uh is it better
than what came before from your perspective uh not from my perspective but i think from most
people's perspective it is so first couple seasons are the ones that are largely disliked even a book
is a season is that how that works yeah well actually technically no i mean not not a whole
lot of people know this but it's just two seasons each comprised of two books so book three would
be the start of season two oh i mean even the co-creators mess this point up all the time
they just refer to the books of seasons as well so i don't blame people for not knowing that yeah
fair enough or learns to be more nuanced with her interactions often being with political leaders
still the complications concerning the avatar's autonomy is only one of the punches core has to
learn to roll with as we're introduced to her in the beginning of the series she already has no
affinity for spirituality without the vital information her past lives possess at her
disposal this causes some issues that should be easily rectified to quickly escalate from
micro level to macro level during her fight with unilac core's connection with the past lives is
severed seeing off any hopes of her turning to them for advice or wisdom does that never get fixed
i've never gets fixed because it never needs to be fixed she never needs them i was gonna say
isn't it more insulting that the idea that they're lost like for the audience it doesn't matter if
she could talk to him or not it's more for the fact that their memory is dead because he's the
only connection does oh yeah it only has to make peace with this but the fact that the avatar that
comes after her when she's gone will only be able to look to her for wisdom ang however refers to
his past lives persistently often when he's faced with a more dilemma or needs historical context
he calls on them for a reliable perspective this resource can't be undervalued as it aids the
avatar in resolving various issues how terrible this essential hmm this just sounds so much better
i don't he's doing a really bad job of arguing that core is better than the hang yeah i mean i'm
getting pretty convinced if for like a relatively neutral standpoint here i was like okay i should
be watching one show over the other here for sure which libergine core spends the rest of her life
at an unprecedented disadvantage forced to resolve any obstacles she faces on her own
or with the help of those who are readily available oh yeah i'm confused he doesn't really
turn to the past after all that often he mostly did that in book three before the final battle
didn't he yeah because he was asking like a lot of different spirits for advice and they all had
different perspectives on it yeah so she faces on her own or with the help of those who are
readily available nevertheless this doesn't impede the results she produces managing to overcome this
disadvantage and set on most of her discrepancies without involving i like her disadvantage of
losing her powers and then getting them all again yeah cool really interesting her past lives their
flexibility in handling these obstacles is what draws the fine line of what they're capable of
i think this is where ang falls short and core excels ang has to stop the ever looming threat
of totalitarianism the fire load is wrong and has no redeemable qualities as far as motivation
and perspective so ang stopping him should be evident core is never presented with such a
blatant right and wrong scenario none of the goals of her adversaries aren't inherently bad
do you agree with that just not fucking true villains the evil carpet isn't a good guy right
yeah the dark avatar isn't the most clear-clad example bad guy there ever was i just i thought
he was like evil in carpet yes the point of it darkness it's just uh what is what is evil carpet's
motivation he is the incarnation of chaos and he wants to destroy light i guess ten thousand years
of darkness i like that motivation yeah in depth this okay rather than means by which they try to
achieve them amon strives to establish equality but only widens the social rift between um
but he doesn't really that's something that's a whole other thing to get into
a mom wanted equality he's gonna like real guy gonna rush through the villains of korra and give
them a really generous probably conclusion right that's probably what this is yeah the benders and
non-benders unilac wants to reinstate balance but his misguided effort to create harmony nearly
creates chaos sehir attempts to provide liberty for the world but instead forms a power vacuum in
the earth kingdom and while kovir desires order for the earth kingdom order quickly becomes
perverted to fashion so yeah she's a totalitarian for superior because her villains have better
motivation than angs that's not even really an argument for why she would be superior to ang
yeah this i mean this is so basic people like the villains of korra so much that's why that's
clearly why he's gone but it doesn't really explain why she's any better than ang i know
that just never happens but okay well he said it did so he didn't have to prove it
that she reflects him of course past impulsive traits don't worry guys rags will retain simply
defeat her enemies and disregard their idealistic goals korra learns from her foes to gain a more
well-rounded perspective in the future angs dilemma is more one-dimensional the fire lord wants world
domination which can impede on global i'm assuming ang has to deal with more than just the fire lord
go yeah significantly more yeah i mean he's mainly dealing with his son for the majority of
the show who has a much more complicated arc than any of the villains could even in korra could even
hope sounds convenient to ignore that guy yeah yeah let's ignore zuko really like one of the
best characters in the show yeah the avatar's purpose is the preservation of peace thus the
actions ang must take are clear the only dispute being that he has to put aside his personal values
to fulfill his duty this shines a light on his more stubborn interest lame ang is naive and
thinking he can find a way around killing those even after his predecessors tell him otherwise
such a clear-cut decision is juxtaposed to korra who has to contemplate ideologies with more moral
ambiguity what did aman want equality for all unalaq he brought back wasn't aman
yeah it's there's a twist at the end of book one where he turns out to be some water vendor he's
just got something with his dad and he just went off his fucking rocker i guess
it's serious and zahir believed in freedom okay so i could be like i can overdie a stain
from iron man one i could be like he believed in a support for the world to provide an arsenal
for all factions and equality of opportunity as well as to be able to capitalize upon it and you'd
be like that's pretty generous considering everything he does in the movie i'd be like well
that's your opinion yeah
i guess that's a response i guess wow
korra is misunderstood because it debates these complex concepts and so does korra
she isn't a better avatar than ang because she's stronger or smarter but rather her examination
of these things make her more i like that he said it as if that's some point someone was making
the ang is better because he's not her strongest like well although world testing her trials and
tribulations far surpassing his resulting in her mindset reaching him trials and tribulations far
surpassing his i love that we established that he had to stop a fucking world dominating nation
that had nearly conquered everything in 100 years oh yeah now i never i guess the incarnation of
chaos is a big deal you know i never finished korra because it made me want to die inside but
i don't remember her ever getting electrocuted and cut off from the avatar state for a good long while
i guess she got hit with some water whips and permanently cut off she got amnesia dude
oh right what did that happen uh so uh she was out on a little boat ride after breaking up with
a boyfriend and a dark spirit attacked her and she lost and she just washed up on a beach and
she didn't have her memories anymore oh that makes sense yeah that is a trial and a tribulation right
there right there yes that's it that's seriously it all right that was such a weird ending all right
yeah well there you go guys i feel like thoroughly convinced yep korra is definitely better than ang
i don't know what i've been thinking all these years i don't know i could have missed i'm misguided
for this long honestly if i had watched that on my own i would have been like i don't know
seems like i guess better yeah i don't yeah he tried he tried i mean it must be tough being a
fan of korra right it really must be i don't understand how anyone does it that's wrong
yeah i was thinking before reading superchats considering you're not often on live shows would
you be willing to just let chat ask you some questions mr sure why not so do do at molar i
guess i'll be able to pick them out or i guess you could do at er and you can pick the questions
have you got chat up oh i can you just do that and then if you can you can just choose whichever
ones you want if they or uh your name too fast i had to steal rag soul to stay awake it's true
the first one is is el racist of course
that's not in doubt er becomes alive when he hates yeah that's what i needed
will you be a guest more often maybe homecoming thoughts on spider-man homecoming ah
it's not my well i mean i like the villain i like the world building in it
it's nice that you know there are actual repercussions for new york and they show it
and it affects the world i have but my big thing with it is i just kind of don't like how
iron man tony stark he's at fault for basically everything in that movie and then he has the gall
to kind of turn on poor little peter and be like should have behaved better even though i ignored
you well he sent the api in yeah but clearly that i mean i understand where peter's coming from
he has no idea about any of this and he thinks that his home's in you know apparel that's true
it's just that um hey rex it's just uh if he had told iron man that he probably would have been
fine but he told tony that he was on like a for a school trip or whatever yeah but that's after
being ignored what's um how long oh your video's done all right so was kora better than um yeah
because like i'm i mean unabashedly i'm a pretty big fan of homecoming um rags what do you think i
really like homecoming i loved it that was great you i believe liked it yeah i liked it uh a lot of
i i found a lot of people were unhappy that i am and was even in the film you're more unhappy with
his role in the film is it yeah yeah i feel like they they create a
some conflict there that is so manufactured to me what kind of a tribe that so these
what's the what's the bad guy's name again i forget vulture yeah and he
it's causing so many problems for peter and the city
okay and tony gets on his case for wanting to try to resolve it
it's not it's not wanting to try to resolve it it's that he tried to resolve it and then
almost created even worse things yeah while tony was trying to take care of it yeah but there's
this it just feels so contrived their miscommunication to me
i mean i don't remember the movie all that well so i can't really can't really put forward my
position yeah it's all good man uh so you're just you're you kind of like it kind of not
sort of how you feel yeah yeah go ahead and grab another question all right i'm going too far
is l a better avatar than ang
well uh maybe original l if
like we're the fire lord uh follow up on my oh man i miss so many questions apparently
oh it's okay you'll never be able to grab them all
oh no i zip by 300 bajillion oh my god
you've been like the most requested guest ever on this show yeah oh my
jesus christ every single one is a quite i gotta go i gotta go up
okay well here's a super chat is er aware of alpha of alcopax core series yes i am it's very good
everyone should check that out better than mine um let's see
is er racist very clear that answer oh what is your opinion on attack on titan
yes i mean it's good everyone most people would have fun with it i recommend it
sounds like he's high yeah that's probably how i sound all the time he's been air bending is what
you're saying high on the clouds why do people wife quora you know brown waifu
with muscles some people are into that not me because i'm a racist i guess
are you racist against muscles yeah clearly he only likes the skinnies
are traps gay yes your appearance is the best birthday gift for me thank you
how do you feel about people calling you a nazi i mean they see what they see
were you surprised when thanos said the end we're in the end game absolutely not
that's just the thanos way uh what are er's anyone thoughts on the jewish question
well clearly they need to be stopped are you planning a video on us uh maybe oh right yeah
we actually talked about that us was really bad a little back and forth smaller on that one not
a great yeah i leave that one to you so you can destroy it if you well i mean if you're not going
to someone asked if i go for that one after black panther my reputation is uh let's see favorite
jojo i haven't watched enough jojo like i didn't know the meme from earlier i'm not far behind
and best avatar waifu katara what is your opinion on pews throwing you under the bus i don't think
he did that i mean he said he would distance himself from the edge lordy-ness i'm a bit edgy
that's fine is you nazi
uh if you ask er if he disavows his anti- jewish remarks no
the shoes have to be done away with is er really black yes will er marry me saith wishes depends
uh thoughts on kill the kill uh y'all know what kill the kill is i've seen the first
i've seen the first like three episodes of it yeah ah actually there's a
good video by the late demolition d he died well functionally is the youtube channel done is it
yeah pretty much i don't think he's ever returning which is such a shame such a shame
but he did a great video on it i basically agree with everything he says in it
was it like negative or positive or it was probably leaning more toward negative
that it had a a good concept just didn't execute it perfectly yeah it was pretty goofy yeah
yeah is ray or captain marvel stronger that's a tough one because i mean
removal wars and yeah that's true yeah because like as much as marvel's powerful
couldn't rage use the force to like snap something and corrupt him i was brain and killer
okay captain marvel doesn't have brain um that's actually a genuine question for all
well for all four of us i guess who's actually a better character like in terms of writing ray
or captain marvel i mean i think i think it's ray because at least ray has like something as tiny as
it is i don't know actually i think that captain marvel actually goes on a character journey it's
just completely fucked as in there's an actual template there but ray doesn't do anything really
like i can't really i'm honestly not sure who's with yeah at least well they both care about
things for mysterious reasons um
i'm gonna defer to you guys because i haven't watched captain it's so bad wolf it's so it's
so bad i know i've heard nothing good about it so i'm just not gonna watch it
yeah so i got nothing um i i think they're both awful
oh i couldn't tell you perfectly balanced let's say
okay any hints on what your next video is uh well it might have something to do with our brown
waifu from earlier again what do you do for a living when not being an anti-gem well i mean
that's full time for me new mic when you upload when uh this is a new mic actually
oh really not perfectly set up yet you upload you know whenever i get to
what are er's favorite books that is that's a tough one um
if anyone knows what the broken empire trilogy is that's pretty good i've heard of it
i would recommend star wars thing no that is a fantasy kind of grim dark fantasy book series thing
hmm very edgelordy so it appeals to me
what do you think of erin eos's show in flux that would be the dragon prince i have not
finished season two i can't say i'm thrilled with it i heard the animation is kind of air
yeah it does that reduced frame rate cg thing to make it look more i guess 2d
traditionally animated and it doesn't look great
are you fat in real life no not quite
thoughts on hunter hunter there was a meme with that earlier actually it's very good everyone
should watch it even though it's 148 episodes that's like the one time i'll say that you should
uh is there a gem amongst your current cast blink three times yes
oh blink blink uh let's see mcu needs to end i think it has kind of the game's ended
uh did you watch seaman universe the season's finale uh i guess i did if this is the final
season i don't know if steven universe is still going actually i never got into it jay likes it
he does well jay very interesting taste is er dead inside completely
sounds like he's barely awake that's just me being dead inside
is you ever stream live in your own channel uh i don't know i don't know man this is proof
of concept you can actually respond to people fine uh favorite color
hmm black white of yep
what are your feelings on juice orange is the best
oh let's see would you recommend a mob cycle one yes i would recommend it any
uh if you you like one punch man right mauler same author very good possibly better in my opinion
oh well it's er mean easy rape
close in concept maybe
uh
let's see thoughts on the greatest story never told should be told more
your steven universe videos the funniest thing okay well funniest thing i've seen in a long time
thank you do you speak ebonics i guess when i have to don't need to among my white men here
yeah we can translate it
a favorite more to hate on don't understand that question favorite more to hate on
i don't know uh where is your pick from this one is um
um from fall in new vegas actually really yeah that's uh what the fuck is his name
is it mr what is his name the the main uh antagonist in mr house there you go
that's just me superimposed over it someone kindly made that for me but normally that guy
would be shiro from long horizon another anime that everyone should watch uh steins gate video
when uh you know when i guess uh is the success of endgame good or bad for the movie industry
i think it's good um complicated because when you get so many people trying to copy it
and they do terrible we just get tons of terrible shit oh yeah exactly yeah i guess it remains to be
seen yeah my boy are you a true blacker true blacker do you like jojo i like the first season
and you continue watching did you get some coffee you sound like you need some coffee
i could use some coffee but i don't drink coffee me neither never like the taste yep four of us are
non-cofas
some repeat questions here thoughts on shield hero um
uh good concept good beginning but it's kind of gotten a little generic
with uh a waifu harem and all that
do you think pineapple's going pizza no and it's not just a meme it just doesn't happen
the correct take
um favorite dinosaur
i um i guess i'll just go with blossom after clever girls you know
uh let's see
have you read or watched a shio no jo and nisekoi i watched nisekoi
i don't know what the other one is actually nisekoi was uh you know if you're into romance
go for it not quite my thing it was just super chelsea why does er sound so depressed it makes
me sad dead inside like i said it makes sense guys we ever talk about video i don't actually play a
lot so probably not or at least not very often
so are you saying you are sith
uh did i imply that earlier and if you have to choose between
sith or jedi i'm pretty sure you could go with sith right yeah i mean if that makes me nazi
well that's just a bonus thing they get
have you read pill mauler on one two yet on what one punch man season two
oh uh i've only seen episode one i'm waiting for the rest to come out first
i'll pill me on anything if i haven't seen it i guess i can't worry it's a little
it's a little something
uh let's see
but have you watched black lagoon and is revy and mary sue
she's too psychotic to be in mary sue but yes i have watched black lagoon it's pretty good
have you debated er on civil war yet technically we haven't we did yeah sort of i i i it's we don't
want to get into that unless you like re-watch it because i i will never give up it's like my
my baby yeah yeah well i guess our positions were uh you got i thought captain america was
completely right in every way yeah and my take is that he's morally right but
uh i am man is pragmatic and realistic yeah i think i was arguing that those
character i think i don't remember i would have to re-watch it i actually um i argued with yms
about it too i've i'm i'll take it i i will literally take every famous youtube film critic
on civil war is like amazing rags back me up because i can't stand on my own it's my it's
my favorite mcu movie it all holds together the character interactions are consistent everybody
behaves in a way that makes sense it's just a lot of details and a lot of the fights that
are really nifty to see i think wolf is closer to your take er he's not a huge fan you're like
okay with it right well i'm like okay with it but i i guess part of it is i i was just never
really invested in a lot of the characters so i walked out of it kind of just bored yeah
um i guess kind of the same there let's all four of us re-watch it sometime think about it
yeah sure all right uh let's see do you promote pewdiepie well he put out a depressing video today
about the ending the subscribe to pewdiepie meme oh really i guess we can't promote him in that way
yeah is it to do with the the things that have happened or is it someone else yeah kind of yeah
he mainly focused around the christ church situation that's really shitty so yeah that was
because that's why i sound so depressed that is depressing
short like short of romans rags well what's it like being right about civil war
you realize there's loads of people who hate civil war this is not a position that's no i
have no idea why i honestly do not see why people will have to i'll have to cover it someday in
some way like find some videos because there's a lot of videos that break it down somebody wants
to guest on efap has a video about how bad civil war is so we'll figure something out
uh okay let's see our semi is ever going to be a thing again oh
well i like to take my time on things apparently so maybe but maybe not you never know
what are your thoughts on woke jax i don't know what that means oh so you know anything about
mall combat 11 oh well not really but now i kind of i've seen the memes i believe from what i
understand in the narrative if you beat the ladder with the character they get the ability
to time travel and jax decides he wants to go back in time to end slavery right yeah
which is super awkward in the mall combat universe because like this
this is an ongoing thing it's a completely different world but earth exists alongside
like six or seven other realms it's the most bizarre like it it's just okay all right yeah
fine okay yeah i don't know why he would want to make america a white ethnostate that's really
strange fuck it right jax is black he wants to go back to he wants to keep everyone in separate
places um but maybe he's gonna do the do the killmonger thing maybe he'll like attack america with
the people of africa and that'll work out well i think he has to what a killmonger want to do kill
every person in power who isn't black and their children that was that was this glorious villain's
plan who everyone celebrates has been a great mc villain yeah because remember everyone who
is black thinks the same as all other blacks and all the non-blacks think exactly the same
they scared around that the movie he says stuff like people who look like us
are you you saying black people or you say what do you say
slave traders all the you'll know they don't count
oh okay you can't enslave your own race of course yeah it's just right uh it's surprise
employment without pay that'll pay the rest of your life do you see black panther yeah
yeah i saw half of it really bad
i had to rewatch it in prep for uh ed game uh bad did i i was just like
at the risk of shit yeah the moment i think i quit when they killed sweegle
whatever is i don't know right um claw i guess his name yeah i kind of i was half
half into it for him the moment they got rid of him i was just done
yeah i felt kind of similar actually i thought he was actually interesting
yeah but well uh is er black yes
looking at a picture of him right now that's where that explains the red lips
hmm oh yeah and the huge eyes exactly how far do you want to take this joke considering the
purple background he likes his complimentary colors yeah great drink grape juice is good guys
y'all's is racist not as great as like fried chicken and watermelon but you know yeah it's
a good complimentary love that chicken from pop eyes uh let's uh people really wanted me
talk about ashido no joe i've never heard of it
are you caught up with the manga attack on titan no i have not read i have it gets fucky
oh i bet um all our please ask er is jenning with us the jewish question i would love it if
you'd ask him this don't forget to ask him the orphan question as well what's the orphan question
oh um as a rule people will love biological children more than adopted children
yes or no i yeah i well i mean this is a trap
so i guess my take would be absolutely no because to make a rule you'd need to
have you can't have that many exceptions of which there's like thousands well you can't have
a exception well apparently yeah apparently you're allowed an exception um with a rule but
this one is fucking oh i think that's bullshit anyway but the the the idea that say you just
to have a mother she adopts a kid she has a biological kid and you're like yeah she's you
know that's a rule she'll love the adopted one less and i'm just sitting there like you have no
fucking clue there's so there's so many things that will change what happens that's just yeah
it's almost irrelevant data i can understand like say your house was on fire you had to choose
between your adopted kid and your biological kid i could totally understand you choosing the
biological kid first every time not well maybe not every time but i could totally understand
yeah that's what i would do if i could understand the reverse it's just i just don't understand like
why this is even an important question or why anyone gives half a fuck about it because it's
a trap that is a trap well yeah you know i'm gonna i'm gonna skip over that one for
honest i love how many questions he's answered that's the one he's gonna talk
yeah uh yeah let's see um what got you invested in sieving universe to begin with
uh a friend really likes it and i basically made that sieving universe video just to fuck with them
um it was never intended to be seen by so many people which is why is that video taken down um
i'm not even sure about now because so many things have happened to it
i think it's just blocked in like every country at the moment that's so fucked up well yeah
uh yeah well that's what you get for putting hitler propaganda video at the end of it
apparently there's a youtube it was made a end game review and says that i'm gonna have
a field day ripping this one apart i'm just like oh we just we just did it's all three hours
go watch it
uh let's see
er co thoughts in the upcoming godzilla film the monsterverse
i have really no opinion because i've never watched a godzilla movie in my life
uh
there's some questions here that would be too long to answer like if you could write a pilot
episode for avatar it's continuation what would you do i wouldn't do it actually
really short and sweet that let's see don't be sad trump 2020 is on the horizon
sure if you say so i think
yeah some actual competition this time um
um pinion on aquaman the movie i've never i haven't seen it musical well if you'd recommend
watching it right no no i don't not even remotely no oh no um well yeah i didn't like that movie
i mean if you want like a good laugh then watch dracula untold oh yeah have you watched that one
watch which one dracula untold dracula untold no i showed uh mauler and regs it's like one of my
favorite bad time it's it's fucking wonderful dracula untold okay it'll give you a real good laugh
a specific moment oh yeah uh any anger toward mother's basement nah not really
uh he just seems funny to me i kind of like him to be honest uh let's see
it's okay to be wrong my child but
i don't know who knows have you okay what kind what kind of video do you like to play
well lately i've been playing the persona games should take me forever
let's see thoughts on fma brotherhood excellent everyone should watch that
where you're radically groomed by jim uh i've picked up his uh scheduling
oh like never releasing yeah can't be helped oh lost my place oh he said he meant it's okay
to be wrong about civil war um but am i though to be continued well we'll see uh do you think
disney intentionally is killing star wars no i mean very least they don't think so they're making
bucket loads of money off of it yeah that's true they could probably make more if they were doing
if they were doing things differently and if you were to stealth kill it i feel like this
is probably the way you'd do it but i think they're incompetent rather than sabotaging
yeah i would say so yeah
oh oh my god there's just so many questions i mean you don't have to answer them all you
can pick whenever you're uh he's satisfied yeah sorry folks i'm going to skip over a couple of
them see
okay i think this guy is repeating this one legend of the galactic heroes actually haven't seen it
i hear it's very good so i will eventually get to it
um but have you and or have you seen the late 90s hbo animated series based on spawn
no have you guys yeah i don't know anything about spawn yeah no idea
um
see is it true when you go black you never go back
i'm pretty sure that's true isn't it yeah well i started blacking you never went white
i can't say i've ever gone to anything else are you asian no clearly not
uh
yeah which race is the largest hive mind mentality japanese blacks or jews
happy to help getting all the good questions today
oh i'm such a contrarian so they can't be the hive mind there
this is either japanese or jews take a pic
what do you think of goblin slayer anime very good well yeah pretty good manga is very good
shoot up the manga
how much better is avatar than naruto
in my opinion very much better
um
oh so many questions is it er gray really not
starving black child er okay okay
uh er is gray confirmed you know something i don't
do a video on ruby i won't but i know someone who is doing one
and whenever he gets that done willing to shell it out that'd be good shit um
let's see do you want a threesome with the two doggo i don't quite swing the furry way
because we were dudes
uh not bigoted like that um
who is best waifu
either the top questions
let's go with i mean
i mean objectively and mary sue has to be the best wife right uh you would automatically
love them and they'd be the best at everything so yeah makes sense so i guess it's a it's again
the question between ray and captain marvel i think more people dislike captain marvel than ray
ray i would go for ray personal but captain marvel can like carry you through is that
you can protect you from phantoses
that's true but i'm i'm pretty all right with the purple folk
well there you go
uh i'm pissed off that you said grape drink why would you be
do with the sincerely well within my rights
uh i know you're excited for final i actually haven't finished it yet because i'm like halfway
through and i'm not thrilled with it and it's kind of ruining my
stein's gate as a whole not great in my opinion so far
uh don't you think that the ending of soul eater's anime
yeah i love the anime though but ending is bullshit yes
uh favorite racial slur
more tough questions
uh
hmm so cruel to make you pick one great i know so many options um
yeah i couldn't just pick one that's like choosing your favorite child i know
for any from adopted
uh well if they're not black i guess
uh do you know you'll have many more questions directly you want
i guess that's true and that
wait what was what did they say i said there will be more questions directed
chats maybe i should start breezing through these a lot faster i mean there's a few super chats
with them in there as well so just let me know when you want because this is going to take at
least two hours oh boy uh well okay i'll go through a few oh lost my place
uh did the any thoughts on scientific visual very good
if you're into visual novels if you're not definitely probably not gonna like it
cats or dogs dogs yeah boy
correct ends
do you think we should farm rhinos apparently people have a real big thing for their milk
so i suppose so
what is best in life er
hating on quora
what was the best marvel movie iron man one and my
that's some civil war fans near those
do you enjoy so bad it's good you know not really for the most part
trying to think of exceptions to that for me though room the room
i like the memes but having to sit through the whole movie a little tough for me
i'll do three more questions how's that sound go for it
uh yeah what are fbi crime statistics
well you'll find that on fbi.gov i believe go ahead and check them out interesting stuff
um gosh why is tough so small and she's 12 and blind
does blindness uh dictate height yes okay i guess so she's she's fearless oh yeah
i don't know she's fearless because she's blind truth
uh did uh what do you think was that fault for the two best friends breakup
uh youtube
uh here i'll do one more try to find a really good one
um
not that one
uh
oh here's a great one how many people died in the holocaust
i mean just to round it off i guess
six million and never question that
so there you go all right um two more meme roost i'm gonna put on i think brag some wolf
death oh my god oh wow i like how its eyes are like galaxy i like that the the galaxy is shaped
like an egg is the cosmic egg after all from the cosmic chicken i have an artist rendering of
goliath i suppose wow is that a fucking eye in the brick yeah god it's a dark place
uh this was said to be and i just i don't know i think it's pretty funny uh but i don't know
if has anything to do with efap probably not i love it then obviously a wonderful celebration
beautiful action picture gorgeous
lovely which brings me to super chance so uh you know anyone is welcome to do whatever they want
this is going to take a very long time and it's uh it's going to be great oh yeah i'm gonna say
i'm gonna bug out i gotta head up uh good half hour north to watch game of friends oh yeah north
north north north which means i'm gonna have to collect all the fucking questions for you
yeah you can send them to me oh right uh tomorrow on blessed southpaw's channel i'll be streaming
with him and another guy they don't know when sometime in the late afternoon let me find a
blessed southpaw channel so i can actually link in chat he's pretty sure his channel is just called
blessed southpaw isn't it oh that's how i found it but people people can be dumb and they like links
uh did i say that i mean people can be smart yeah pop a link in chat well y'all can fucking
use their shit to go find that yeah well it's going to be on there tomorrow you say yes
yes sometime in the late afternoon uh southpaw didn't give me an actual time but at some point
tomorrow er was cool having you on the show thank you yeah i'm sorry wolf was here well
sorry i ruined the whole thing i tend to do that a lot yeah we'll uh we'll we'll look about game
of thrones tomorrow okay oh absolutely oh i'll see you guys later see ya later bye bye all right
then oh i guess i should put southpaw's channel in in the description now so that i'm gonna put wolf
is bait what was this i guess he's talking on there wolf is guesting here tomorrow there
we go people will make total sense of that um i'm not even sure exactly what they're doing but
hey you know all fun um so i'm just gonna i'm gonna read these out and we'll do our best to
respond and acknowledge one of them holy shit you actually got him yeah i told you elusive
people don't believe you actually come on to like life me elusive i've been begging to come on
i don't believe brushing me off in the dms don't tell people that okay harsh i don't know why you
suddenly changed your mind but i you know you're right you n-words got er yeah see people were just
shocked that you even were here to begin with um love you guys but i haven't seen endgame yet
take my money you glorious man i must run from the spoilers yeah there's gonna be a lot of people
who haven't seen it yet so this will just be on moolah hopefully it doesn't get hit with copyright
thingies i'd like this one to be up so people actually know what we think of it finally um
all of our lords are here god smiles this day that is true screw endgame we got er you got both
fucking both we'll have to watch this tomorrow but have my money i hope you're all okay especially
wolf and raggo there you go oh yay special mentions they don't care about me and y'all
but that's fine oh oh we know why they show up hello mine i'm the talent
oh i feel like that reference is perfect that people need to understand where it comes from
hello mine fury are glad to finally see you're on here thanos kills dumbledore damn
and i shouldn't have read that out they've just essentially spoiled all of harry potter now
is er on efap the most ambitious crossover of all time what did you all think of thanos
saying the n-word when he killed black panther for a second time in endgame um i thought it was
controversial but they make bold choices a lot in the mcu i feel like it's probably the most
creative movies have ever been in their entire existence so sometimes you just got to make choices
that um may not work out thor got daddy thor got daddy thick on a serious note i like that they
made him funny again like from ragnarok but i don't think they made him dumb i don't like
that they made him dumb for some reason he's funny sure but like like i said earlier it's
like it kind of felt like we were laughing at him rather than with him yeah look at the funny fat
idiot it's like uh i don't think billbo baggage actually said this i'm pretty sure he said
everything i believe so catching this on the road back home love you all so much also molar i finally
got around to watching your amnesia soma series it's incredible here's to a great stream thank you
sir pick and flipper very kind uh drac should have bombed the girl power moment and then said
something drac's like oh that would be amazing if the camera like panned over and drac's was standing
there and he's like what maybe i would have liked a bit more if that happened
is everyone excited for star wars episode nine the emperor's new groove
yeah kronk and for this episode of er fap that's yeah that's a good way to combine it i suppose
anise's ship should have been shot down by a shield helicaria commanded by nick fury changed my mind
um i would have preferred anything than captain marvel running in and destroying it i was just
like oh anything is the less captain rule of thumb the less captain marvel the better
unless she's getting murdered unless she's getting murdered in which case the more murder the better
i have a running theory that thanos is an orphan since orphans can't be loved they just want to
watch the world burn thus or thanos is an orphan i think that probably makes enough sense that's
probably going to be in his prequel movie which is why you saved the biological kids
they think you cut 50 but nobody actually counted they just assumed guys are all
that is a little weird what that doesn't that he snaps half the life out of the universe right
so would that really exactly translate to half of life oh no it could have been all of life
out of earth for all we know yeah but i think at the near the beginning they say something about
a census yeah it looks like it was exactly half or something like that oh i didn't see a number
but yeah it would be ridiculous if it was down to the singular person a 50-50 split
i think they imply that it's i don't think they confirm it but they imply that it's
half that would be just silly a little weird but okay you guys are all awesome love your channels
not bad 1300 in a few minutes i mean people people want to see mr er i believe you know
that people watch your stuff are you aware of this i have a vague idea very vague
holy shit er what's good my dude uh that's a super chat
avatar i want to watch it all right uh hello e fap i loved it when thanos got sliced and diced
but the movie overall was no infinity wall i i feel similar dude said statement why didn't
they go past to go to past new york city get the time stone and rewind the fried gauntlet
to bring back the stones the way thanos did with vision's mind stone there's a lot of things they
could have done that would have made everything easier for them but they didn't because they did
the things that made for what people would assume would be the funnest thing to see question mark i
guess yeah a lot of tweaks would be made if i was looking at it i guess thank you for bringing er
onto efap no problemo hello all my with lords i don't get it either hello all my n-word space
chickens now that one i make does that make sense polka dabs and thor plays fortnite against noob
slayer 69 yeah see if if you said that to someone like 10 years ago you're like what
five years ago probably smaller like hmm a lot of things happen in this movie are very odd
no one is ever really massive
uh it's beautiful yeah i read of you guys into pick min i have played the first and second one fully
i've played the second one a bit it was fine yeah it's cool uh er is here i don't even have
anything substantial to say right i just need to support this with money from creamy sheave tony
deserved to die because he's an orphan oh that's so unfair he didn't get snapped by thanos so yeah
continuity wise that's just doesn't he make er thoughts on jojo's bizarre adventure i think i've
already answered that first season pretty good liked it so i need to watch the rest
at maula wolf rags holy mastiffs just got home from five days of endgame day five double feature
finale and now er fap what a time to be alive you've watched endgame and infinity war five
times in a row for five days wow that's dedication all right um yeah man efap we've decided to
inform you that yes you are adopted but i wanted to tell you that this doesn't change how much madea
and i love you oh jojo is like conno bono suba castlevania and lsd had a baby watch it wolf
i have to write that down they want wolf has to watch jojo there we go
i'm sure you'll have a really good answer to that it's gonna be worth it oh maula please say
no no no no no no that's embarrassing so we are in the title and i thought i might have broken my
clicker all jokes aside the all-female scene with brian focus i thought i was going to hail
seems like uh so i've got a friend who's like not um pretty on board with stuff like that
and even they said they felt like it was really stupid because um all of the the end moment is
supposed to be about bringing every character together as a team and then it suddenly just
goes these guys are a team you're like oh yeah and he felt like it kind of took away just it
just added an interruption to what was a big celebratory like good guys versus bad guys moment
and i was like wow even the people who like that stuff ain't liking that stuff um i know i know
that like a lot of people do like it i'm pretty sure buggy said that he thought that the old
female scene was pretty good or something you also kept calling falcon hawk it was really
funny to watch i don't know where you got that from exactly uh finally a movie to beat 12 angry
men on imdb i always thought 12 angry men is overrated it won't beat 12 angry men on imdb
i think that endgame will end up with like a seven on imdb probably give it a like a year
i don't know because uh the initial ratings are always really high because fans like to
do ratings but then once everybody gets to put their ratings in and there's a lot of people who
hate the mcu um i wonder if endgame will be the first one to get an oscar though because the
oscars are going to get pressured to probably recognize it in some way shape or form and since
the oscars isn't about quality it's about fucking responding to what people demand to get an oscar
maybe but if black panther didn't get it i mean i mean i got three for different things right
i guess that's true yeah black panther got three oscars that's
um um so now that er is here i must ask you guys who are your waifus and which one is the
official mascot of efap
official mascot of efap is probably tonaled simultaneously a waifu
as for the previous question it's a pretty tough one you guys have answered
there's no way that i don't get in trouble
all right then
because i'm thinking like avatar pick like that they're all underaged so then i get in trouble
well then they wouldn't be at this point right that's how that works that's true you can you can
put as nastrics once they are of age so yeah katara in her 20s let's go with that there you go
oh
oh no no no i i'm i'm i was i was thinking about something else
i have to be these wait what was the question uh who's your waifu i guess um
can i does it have to be a woman no give me any what i get oh wait what are the rules of waifus
can a waifu be if it's a lady um
hmm i don't know i'd actually have to think about it yeah i was gonna say i haven't thought about
it before so i can't really cope with the good ads uh this is the end game of efaps
hopefully efap doesn't get bad progressively from here but i can't say that won't happen to the mcu
i don't know hey er i loved your captain marvel elita video please upload more i will try
notice me senpai notice me that was from aiden paladin i believe you know aiden paladin rags do you
yeah i like her hello you have been noticed hello aiden paladin there are more movies jay hasn't
seen than particles in the universe filbo dad ass baggage hashtag
holy crap yeah glad to see you pop your efap cherry thank you long time coming
aer loved your fallout 76 book wolf sucks
that's been creepy sheave as well uh anyone else feel like they've treated brie larson the way
thor treats quill at the end of endgame fucking lovely um a lot of people feel like
endgame shits on brie larson i don't really get why
it doesn't um yeah it just doesn't show a bunch of her yeah like she wasn't in it for much but
she's it's not like she didn't have a huge effect she saved tony stark she destroyed thanos's ship
and she prevented him from snapping and he head butted her in fear like these are things
that are pretty significant even if she was already in the film for like less than five minutes
oh yeah she puts that scream time to use
blessed weeb is here and all the alt right jokes and scenarios to the efap lore also great
captain marvel elita video mr er thank you fap is too short elbow ragons
loved endgame but i didn't understand the part where mike wazowski made out with thanos
yeah that was weird he's not even you know he's disney i guess but he just doesn't feel like
mike wazowski should be endgame weird cameo um mike wazowski well you need to do some mcu unbridled
rage videos i want to do i'm m3 but um i'm not sure which other which other ones i'd want to do
because like everyone thinks thor the dark world is like the worst the mcu it's like
what do you even complain about outside of it being a relatively meh like it's a good not much
happens like they they discover the creepy red juice they go to asgard the dark elves attack it
and then they try and bait the dark elves that thor has lost his hand but he hasn't and then he
electrocutes chris fragleston and then they go through some weird portals and throw a stick at
him and he dies i don't know it though i remember the film being so just self-contained and strange
but nothing that i felt like how do you make like an entertaining video out of sort of breaking down
thor the dark world don't think you do i don't think you do because like thor's character is
fine in that film and then who else even is there everyone really cares about jane foster right the
nally paulman's character she was a favorite yeah yeah it's just a super chat that says end game
sucked yeah i'll come out of your 1000 year old slumber already and you put out the marvel video
was relatively recent jeez love the movie but the more i think about the ending the more of a total
dick cap becomes in order to have his happy ending kinda cap is just like i hope you guys
don't have any more problems to deal with that's kind of what i was thinking found it a little
weird pulling jj jar jar is funnier than juju well that's like subjective everyone's already
done jar jar you know yo molar i'm asking you to play will will z uh oh that's that came out
recently right it isn't i yeah i believe it's an is it an epic exclusive oh in that case fuck it
yeah let me check steam just to make sure but i think it's an epic exclusive and if that's the
case i ain't touching it um let me look world war z no no doesn't look like it's on here
there we go we're play far north z instead there there is a super chat asking that you
two say welcome to the cum zone in the most provocative way possible i'm giving you the
right to deny the denied what about you rag you denying it welcome to the cum zone there you go
you got half take my free two dollar chat for having youtube remium oh remium that sounds
suggestive i don't know yay for finally getting er on too bad pewds threw you under the bus man he
kind of had to well you did a dress out earlier so it's all good bring on the spoilers but where
you guys bored on repeat viewings lawn man very i haven't actually seen it more than once um i'm
assuming you guys haven't either which one end game no i've only seen it the once yeah yeah um
it'll be interesting to see how the film sort of does over time for like payoffs and stuff but i
doubt the ending for tony stark is ever going to be like not great for me on a on a personal
rag is good job on captain marvel video keep it up thanks i really hate that movie
question for ridges is why do i ugly cry when i poop
why do you only cry when you poop ugly cry why do you ugly cry when you poop i don't even know
what that means you might have to ask a follow-up just go to the doctor at that point why do you
ugly cry when you poop you shouldn't cry when you poop at all pooping should be a blissful
and peaceful experience it shouldn't be one full full of pain and torment i would suggest
eating more salads and cutting back on the meat and fiber fiber will get them them engines running
yeah the meat will make them cleaner but tougher to get out best part of end game is when Thanos
domes captive marvel with the power stone seems like a lot of people really like that moment
but it just so it's just it symbolizes the patriarchy and you it's disgusting you guys
enjoy it honestly have money for rent and time to study for finals or efap easy fucking choice
also er i know this may seem random but what's your stance on adoption uh can i deny this one too
yes you get you have you have 10 000 denials ready that's the maximum though so the movie went
from eight to ten when Thanos knocked Captain Marvel the duck out not only did Thanos knock her out
sorry not only did Thanos knock her out he out thought here
you're yeah that must be tight i guess so yeah so holy fuck end game was amazing see this is
interesting i'm getting such a mixed bag of like i really feel that end game has split a lot of
people not in the same way that PLJ did it's like a different sort of like end game's payoffs were
fine it's just that it didn't make sense that seems to be the negative take you know yeah
most heart string pulling scene asking to make sure it's answered for me Hawkeye versus Black
Widow friends find each other to save each other oh it was Tony's death for me that was my uh
my peak like holy fuck this is bad um i think for me it was Tony talking to his dad
um i'm not sure though i was balling half of half the damn movie fuck ever
what about you yeah i'm trying to say
uh god i don't know i don't have as much of a national attach
was the heart string even fiddled with at any point
heart string you feel it not that i really recall be totally honest
but i guess i did like Tony Stark with his dad i mean the paternal stuff was nice
so i'll go with that Chris Evans willingly went back to the 1950s
heck okay Brie really pulled me out of it during both of it yeah during both of her
ex-marketers i was prepared to leave the cinema because i feared they'd screw it up um yeah this
is what i mean about she she definitely dealt damage to the script we don't even know how she
arrived in both of those scenarios she's definitely considered as an ex-markener and it's not hard to
explain it but they didn't have even a line she's like okay she's just there she does that's what she
does outline for efap novel is 3500 words there's going to be over a three hour long story i think
i have no idea where you're going with that but okay efap novel uh they were in guardians of the
galaxy ship and rocket probably has a tracker yeah that's what i was saying i think that would
make sense but i don't think there was a line in the movie for that at all weird i just joined
does this mean we can talk spoilers without the doge banhammer coming down i s i suppose
what would our position be a week later if we were doing a stream rags would people be allowed to
spoil it or would we be a week yeah like a week from now if we're doing another stream would it
be okay to have any game spoilers i would still i'd still definitely say spoilers because for some
people you never know with some people maybe it's just a matter if they gotta work late nights or
they gotta shift at a certain time or you've had a bunch of stuff pop up i mean people who spoil
and chat be banned um i would say not to spoil it in chat they do oh then they're fucking dicks
that'll work but it only takes a moment to say spoilers this way er and wolf fight about elita
they disagree on it oh we never got to talk about that i guess um i think a wolf hated elita more
than you here duty that's a shame we should have brought that up damn missed opportunity
uh my favorite part of the movie was when thanos punched that sparkly space dike into the dirt
she's uh she's like the sentry now go girl captain marvel is what feminists think they are
doubt doubt that they think they i say i do you know
is film didn't earn tony's death one in 14 million turned out to be bs final fight was a
snider cluster fuck thor ruined caps canonically a massive content now no moments with tony and bucky
um i don't disagree entirely with that statement i don't really understand what the one in 40
million really refers to other than we saw the universe where it worked i don't other than that
you know and yeah it would have been cool to get i don't think we needed a scene for tony and cap
once tony had died i just wish they'd done a reconciliation scene with those two that was
better than hey man i don't want to hate you anymore yeah okay yeah um so rags requested to
be drawn as a futa and wolf stream if someone unscrupulous enough to do that we would be the
appropriate place to post that i mean if rags if you want it on that well i mean technically it's
like my intellectual property in a weird way just answer that with you don't want it all you do
and where to send it that's up to you um is it that bad that it can't be i don't know they said
i don't know uh where do people send stuff for you my email send it to my email 1-800
get rags at gmail.com 1800 G E T R A G S here you go
uh haven't seen endgame yet but wanted to drop by and show my support anyway
thank you black hole was there any payoff for thanos knowing tony and infinity wall
no but he knows the avengers so it's reasonable to assume he looked into them i guess
best part was when thanos knocked out captain marvel with the power stone see everyone is
saying that everyone really likes it when the evil man beats the woman this is disgusting
not enough love for black widow jumping that
tldr was it me y'all's opinions for new people in stream
oh i guess uh so for anyone who's new right now and is waiting to check out the rest of the stream
eventually we're all pretty much on the pay well me and rags subjectively speaking really enjoyed
the film like to high levels but uh we all we're all pretty much on the same page of it having
major flaws in the writing uh specifically plot and then a couple bits with character
and the world is pretty much just destroyed at this point
takeaway spider-man's humility humanity compassion sense of humor hell take away
everything that makes superman good as a character and you have captain carl manvers
sure captain carl i'm captain carl why are you morons giving these guys buddy for doing a google
chat i think that's supposed to be a non-self-aware comic ha ha you think the movie would have been
fixed if captain marvel didn't exist personally i think the movie had bigger problems as well
on top of that good work everyone um well yeah i think a lot of it was because that um
captain marvel just seems so unnecessary for this whole damn thing
i hate it so much i hate marvel i hate marvel i hate captain marvel mauler i fucking hate
captain marvel so much i understand and yeah the i just she's not the only problem with the film
by far yeah uh the roosters are great at writing every character except hulk they have no idea who
he is or what to do with him i would say then they didn't exactly you know there's a there's
a couple things for characters that you could argue they kind of screwed up or didn't explore
hulk yeah i guess we talked about it already so yeah mostly agree uh it's a good thing that
all of peters school got thannest or five-year gap would have caused a lot of problems what
if everyone got the ant-man experience uh well he'd be the only one because he's in that weird
time vortex engine thing yeah yeah you're stranded and thirsty in the middle of nowhere
with the efap cast you're invited to partake in appreciation of their rhino milking powers
how would you satisfy your thirst what how would you satisfy you thirsty being
so wait oh what am i choosing rhino milk from one of you i don't i'm not sure i like that's
where your mind went oh i had to choose one of you to get my milk from let's go where the question
is i mean the question is confusing it says how would you satisfy you thirsty being
well if there's rhino milk there clearly i guess that's how it would be done
yes you drink that through your mouth which is where food goes must be
i need to use the loo i'll be right back even i'm so happy to live in a timeline where the most
hyped event for decades is actually a success marvel is no more treasure than star wars it
was more treasure than star wars the second tlj was released basically killed star wars hyped for
a lot of people we said it before but uh tlj killed ot fans investment tfa fans investment
and prequel fans investment like all three factions were pissed off in different ways
yeah basically it was really interesting that tfa fans were pissed you know like the like you've
ruined tfa it's like whoa this is interesting yeah well that's true um am i the only one who
was confused by the fact captain marvel could speak and breathe without respirator she had in
her own movie i've whatever she's a god nothing she can't do it makes total sense sing to the
pokemon theme captain marvel i am the very best like no one ever was a flat ass is my real test
to virtue signal is my cause beautiful nice uh molar i know you love civil war as i do but would
you say it's an objectively good movie and why i'm just saving it for a video i'm gonna do a full
long breakdown of that movie and i'll probably i was thinking i might have done it on end game
and infinity war but now i think it'll be more satisfying to do it on civil war because i think
it's so much more cohesive than those two um it's always weird to me that i was a fan of all of you
guys separately for years before efap keep up the good work my toxic hen wits beautiful howard pots
is my favorite avenger a little too op though would be uh that's hired man that's what he calls
himself right yep yep the rat that saved ant man was mickey mouse of course it was
oh yeah change your profile pic to your twitter pic gotta make a franchise
too much work i was gonna say are you really asking this man to switch his pictures like jesus
can't stick around today due to spoilers but i still got to show support for my the lads much
love to molar rags wolf er and of course the chat i hope you're all having a wonderful day
hooray thank you my major problems past thanos lack what made present thanos great
thor was underpowered and poorly written hulk was wasted final battle never felt unique like
helms deep or the titan battle i don't think i agree that it doesn't feel unique um but i can
definitely see why someone would feel it doesn't because it's kind of like a bland battlefield
where everyone's just lashed against each other if you know what i mean yeah i didn't expect it
honestly yeah another boy uh to er for future reference you don't need their permission to speak
you can chime in anytime wow good to know this is for er nazi more like yazi
honey you're back after five years will i inherit from you the house your car and your life savings
oh here's my new husband okay bye oh yeah there's probably gonna be a lot of that going on once uh
like if a guy got dusted out of existence and then they consider dead all the dusted people
and the wife like moves on oh god can you imagine how awkward that is so many people's
lives are fucked by this say what so like just picture you have like a wife of even like five
years you get dusted you come back it's five years and moved on she's got a new husband and
maybe even a kid or something yeah that's right that is horrific er what do you think of objectivity
and art uh that is a big and broad question uh i i'll say subjectivity and art does it's
not the end all be all let's go with that there you go thanos snaps things go apeshit mass suicides
and sue hulk snaps snap victims revive find their kids have and heroed and their husbands
such wives remarried mass suicide and sue good job avengers well they're doing the best they can i
suppose versus thanos i was disappointed in there being no redemption at all for star lord hulk and
none really for thanos thaw outside aside from early execution there's a lot so there's a lot
of things they could have done there's a lot of things they had to do maybe if you'd trimmed
second act you they would have been able to shove a lot more character stuff in there i don't know
it's gonna be a tough movie to look back on because i think the problem right now is that
many people are on an emotional high with this film so it's really difficult to sort of break
down all of the elements because it's so fucking huge and it references so many things through all
the films so give it time i think everybody will come down a bit and then be like okay
they didn't really i don't think anyone's going to think they handled hulk well in this film
i don't know that anyone feels that way and it's just funny because he's pretty much never handled
well outside of ragnarok is kind of how i feel about it he's fine in avengers he just smashes
everything uh remember back to your old teachings all who pleased the fans usually care about the
money not the story even the mcu you both you can care about money care about fans and story and
problem with hank pin living is that he can make more pimp articles when they messed up getting
stones and that cuts out tony's moment with his dad you don't have to cut that moment out you can
just make them go there first like tony and cap can go there to get what they need um hulk can
still go to new york etc oh just send tony back to that base that's his job to get the tess rack
from there it'll work uh rags molar wolf in er god damn spider-man 3 versus end game thought
subjectively spider-man 3 versus end game that's an interesting one i would pick egg game personally
spider wait what spider-man spider-man 3 versus end game they said thoughts objectively i don't
really uh wow i still think end game's better because like iron man 3 is no no spider-man 3
oh spider-man 3 oh yeah they're both awful yes spider-man 3 is kind of a disaster like
it's not a lot working in that film
but there we are you know end game is a lot less working as far as i can tell
maybe more time will expose more problems you think bruce hulk would be talking like andre the
giant you don't just become a big green body permanently and not expect more and more side
effects you don't have time to explore any of it they kind of rush him kind of part of the problem
they could have used a whole movie about that a whole movie between these two
about dealing with the fact that the snap happened i don't know they could have done that that could
have been interesting but maybe it wouldn't have made lots of money i don't know uh they
used the same three seconds of fortnight footage in two different shots zero out of ten literally
unwatchable did they really i can believe it you guys think that the reshoots gave us the overuse
of comedy and some of the tonaled issues i hear they had multiple reshoots in january 2019
i have no idea um but i could believe that they they tend to plug in comedy
in mcu movies and it just doesn't always work unfortunately yep have you guys heard that jj
said tfa wasn't meant to be a rip-off apparently that was him genuinely trying to be creative his
excuse was basically all heroes journeys have things in common uh that's bullshit he admitted
to the opposite already what does he mean rip-off as in like you were baited is that what i mean as
in that he just copied oh well i'm sorry what you can't just say all heroes journeys have things in
common when you literally like rip characters and scenes yeah bullshit bullshit he's already
kind of admitted that he took very strong strong influence from a new oak yeah maybe his motivation
was like an homage reference echo through time sort of thing but he went way too far
that would be a better excuse someone asked plank tard how she's feeling now that a rat saved
the universe instead of captain plank no rats are underrated i guess revenge revenge of the
sith versus endgame which is superior guys i'm sorry which ones revenge of the sith or endgame
hmm i think the memes from revenge of the sith long outlast endgame i don't think any memes can
outlast the ones from revenge of the sith they're like they will stand the test of time
objectively it's gotta be the winner why not gather pimp particles first or use time stone
on gauntlet or fly away yeah yeah yep yep i used to think infinity wall slash endgame was the most
ambitious crossover event until i found this stream best time travel story is life is strange oh god
objectively true this is a super chat endgame was not that good
all right endgame is disappointing and plank still opie all right such a varying degree of
happy and sad from uh people time travel in fiction run time is a really good video on
time travel in movies there you go time salvage a book series you're welcome guessing this duplicate
events not the same event probably referencing the discussion on time travel at that point
uh that was linear time for a person not universal i'm gonna have to skip over these because it's
going to open up the whole time travel discussion again end game works off the you can't change the
past because it creates a new universe rule which is infuriating at the end with caps showing up as
it completely contradicts it a lot of people feel that way but doesn't doesn't answer if if it turns
out he's from the original mcu universe the oldman does that answer that well i think this person
is inferring that there wasn't more timelines
um yeah i just have to look into it over and over and over again until i can figure out if
that is a problem or not because i keep hearing different takes and i'm still not exactly sure
time travel complicates everything and i really wish stories would not use it unless it's very
clear um yeah i say that i like primer and that's really complicated so i don't know
what i'm not really it's just time travel bad um i'll wait for jared holt to write about this
stream calling you all racist disgusting nazi lovers for having er on i know er loves jared
holt oh he's just my favorite boy me thoughts on connery bond films i love dr no i like all bond
films because i'm british but they're all kind of silly but every era has its own like
you know ups and downs and stuff but yeah who doesn't love shawn connery as bond
time is like a weird string making a jump through time also must mean to jump through space since
the earth and sun aren't stationary objects yeah we didn't even talk about that getting even more
complicated it's been explored and um some other science fiction pieces where you have to there's
a lot of math that goes into calculating where you drop somebody and inertia and stuff
shadow visti has a decent video explaining endgame i uh yeah i did have a look into that i like it
it's just um i feel like there's probably even more questions to ask about how it all works
this movie reminded me of the return of the jedi i don't know why happened fast time passes and
duke is a jedi and thanos two in the final act yeah i've seen a couple people compare um those
movies oracle notices splits because she accesses multiple oracle owns the multiverse only she would
see fix uh i'm not sure what that's referencing oracle uh the old lady the ancient one oh
he owns the multiverse i don't know about owns the multiverse
uh yeah no idea no idea why didn't they just go back to the point in wakanda when thanos
had literally all the stones and then just not miss and go for their head
i don't know and then take his gondola off him yeah you know these are things they could do
so old secret caps sat sucking on peggy's something while night 11 happened
all after convincing tony to sacrifice his life got it good job movie
what about loki popping off of the tesseract in 2012 new timeline is it negated when cap
goes back and replaces all the stones and i think that's what his tv show is going to be about
because he's got one right i would imagine at this point captain america did 9 11 oh so a recording
that was made in the future carried over to her memory in the past what how so the way i understand
that is that um she she like has some kind of they say network so she has like an upload link i guess
that her brain attaches to and then once a new nebula arrives it like conflicts and then they
get alerted about it that's seems to be what i think happened but we know why it happened
because it allows thanos to be aware of all this shit which to me isn't great like oh okay
uh for the thor timeline would they need to have shot the infinity stone back into natalie portman's
ass again i don't this is the thing i don't really get straight up the bum really get how
they're gonna solve that but also not sure how thanos got the idea for the glove originally
but i otherwise think they missed a time paradox opportunity with thanos and ironman got the idea
of the glove from each other okay yeah they could have done that i guess i think the stones were
just an example of how the timeline could be created returning the stones is to is just to
not screw over that new timeline that's the thing i've seen multiple interpretations a lot of people
are stressing that the only way you create a new timeline is by removing a stone which to most
people that's infuriatingly stupid so yeah i don't know if that's the way i kind of read well that's
what she says right yeah that's what she says so i get it but again you go back in time you kill
thanos according to hulk that doesn't do anything so it must create a new timeline uh the movie
broke its own rule by the end of the movie when cap travels back in time and shows up in the present
i don't understand um wouldn't have solved the problem completely to have him actually come back
as an old guy and then they're all like what the hell and then he's like oh i should probably
explain but even then you still have the problem of his character making that decision i suppose
um can we assume that endgame follows dbz time travel rules we're a super impactful event
uh i.e trunks giving goku harp meds makes a new timeline
i i guess i can't i don't know if you have to assume that in order for the film to make
more sense than it currently does um er your legend of korra videos are my fave on youtube
so here's an sc sc i'm not sure oh super chat oh all right thank you
suit dollar reduce um alba did a great job of turning brie larson into a prepubescent 12 year
old super saiyan all right uh so is this the efap season finale i said i think it's mid season
but i mean i don't know well time will tell us what seasons are actually there uh subjective
time travel works from my perspective that makes sense they should have made a fantastic full movie
instead of captain marvel to properly introduce alternate timelines and time travel also high
rags hello um i love you er love you too yeah beautiful stuff why doesn't captain marvel such
maybe that means sucks such the gauntlet to revive tony since brie larson keeps telling us
that's the strongest avenger oh you mean like she puts it on uses the time one to reverse tony's own
death maybe i don't know what are the rules i'll be really awkward though if she said i don't want
to hurt myself and then they're like oh that looks that looks painful i don't know what pain is
i don't want to experience it i've never experienced it i don't want to either
you guys yeah apparently it's a big deal to you guys i don't want to i don't want to go through
that it looks like it sucks i love how captain marvel was just a space taxi
it was that at the beginning she did other stuff end game sucks ass one out of ten ruined the
characters in the story i can't understand how you rated it so high i usually agree with y'all but
not with this i don't think we rated it so high did we you mean not objectively no it like a five
is not a good score typically um er love your content thank you how familiar are you guys with
the original star trek movies i asked because the main cast signing the credits was reminiscent of
star trek six i've not seen that familiar with them at all oh we didn't we didn't really talk
about that i thought that was cool the whole cast signing as the images came on and i finished out
with uh iron man as well that was pretty cool yeah uh the one reality strange looked for was
the one where tony died because he hated tony so much of course cap fights himself he has a mask
plus no battle damage not sure what to make of that the funny thing about dr strange's prediction
is if one version of them winning exists their chances are 50 50 infinite possibility and all
that well if there no if there's when it comes to infinite well wait a second what was it what was
the super chat again the funny thing about dr strange's prediction is if one version of them
winning exists their chances are 50 50 um i don't really get it how it would be one chance
it would be one out of the how many well yeah i figured that there are infinite chances of them
winning slash losing but there's it seems to be ratioed against them you know well the issue is
that if you get it depends on how many attempts you're allowed to make if you're allowed to make
an infinite chance then no matter how unlikely an event is given an infinite amount of attempts
it's inevitable that it happens a lot of people in chat are saying no i don't yeah i don't understand
exactly what he's saying there yeah i'm sure it's probably a philosophical concept about
uh probability maybe i'm not sure but um maybe uh the cap marrying peggy makes the sharing kiss
super weird that is true are we not going to talk about the timeline break with thor taking mjolnir
well cap returns it if you returned it at the right time uh our thor well that thor from that
universe or timeline whatever would never have noticed yeah all good another thing to consider
how did thanos's ship time travel bad nebula used to pin particles up to get to the current
time also everyone comes back to current time at the same time so how did thanos ship come to
current time later than the rest um i guess nebula made it so it arrived later through the
button she pressed i i think if you look into it it falls apart honestly uh but yeah we tried
to earlier it's just very confusing yes sounds so bored but i'm glad he's here gg hey um go to
google google thanos's name oh i've done that yeah that's pretty nifty go to front if you if you
google thanos um the thing i saw said to scroll down first so you make sure you load it all up
and then you hit the gauntlet something's gonna happen okay oh rusa brothers shrank away from the
responsibilities of the narrative they started destroying the gauntlet was a mistake the easy
way out end game remix i'm not sure there's an easy way out of infinity war in general
but i probably would have done it differently it makes a it makes a lot of sense that
thanos would destroy it yeah i think so um obviously you didn't have to write that that way
but i think it it totally turns out that he would want to do that if it's possible this is the thing
we didn't even know it was possible like oh okay how did hawkeye and blackwood do not know how to
get the life stone before they go to vormir nebula stated this in infinity war happened
war happened with gomorrah my only issue is that gomorrah didn't
uh nebula didn't discuss it with them that that's possibly what it takes
but she didn't know for sure i i guess i don't know that she did she says in infinity war she's
like you went to vormir with her and she didn't come back and you have the stone so it seemed
like she figured out that you require and if she didn't talk then man it sure is a crazy good
coincidence that the two people who were supposed to go get the soul stone loved each other really
like what if what if war machine and nebula went for it they'd be like uh
how much do you like me should we just talk until one of us falls in love
uh i guess they nerfed thor but then again thanos beat hulk in physical combat i think
people just forget how strong thanos is all by himself it's not exactly clear in fairness
i think it's a little bit like what needs to happen for other things to happen yeah he's
kind of a strong ever needs to be um from pro face er senpai please notice me
also opinion on h bomb a guy in contour points uh i don't know them very well
but someone showed me quite a bit of contour points recently i just gotta say they look kind
of satanic to me satanic huh satanic like like dressed up like a demon and
doused in red lights it was like it was weird it was contour points you said i'm not a nazi
is something a nazi would say fucking brilliant commentary there so what about non-nazis who say
it are they nazi nazi non-nazis i always like that they think it's a quite a clever counter
but i'm just like you realize the counter is non-nazi say it as well though oh weird the mom scene is
one of the worst mcu scenes oh sweetie f becoming worthy of who you're supposed to be just be a
drunk runaway massive and let the drunk runaway black lesbo take over tiki what she says is
applicable to what he's going through but not it's not like she said that she said just you know
be who you're gonna be instead of who you're supposed to be it's i thought it was a nice
sentiment uh if captain sue can move ftl why didn't she do that to solve the problems oh well
glad she got falcon punched regardless yes again see lots of people feel this way any opinions on
the video dusty smith did in response to the captain marvel hey also what are your thoughts
on robert storms i have no idea who that is you two i don't know who that is um but i i didn't
know that captain dusty was a defending captain marvel um i think from what i know is the he's
just making fun of like the crazier takes like like i don't know that he like well it's like what
like the video essays you find the weirdest straw men or you know like craziest i don't know bullshit
right oh yeah like no bullshits take on anything is usually hilarious so ubi like us is saying that
we defend i don't know dmc hate and it's like all we did was respond to tonals because he's
when it's like it's but uh yeah i don't know maybe he is maybe he really likes captain marvel
otis captain marvel performed the holdo maneuver she should have she could have split thanos in
half yeah why didn't she sooner uh teleporter shrinks you down and resize you well but it
still moves you from a position to another position right i don't know i don't know what
it's considered to be shrinks down to the quantum realm and then using that to transport yourself
back in time like how do you fucking what do you guys call that like something travel
it's something yeah i don't have a name for it hey late to the party your opinions in short
well we did that about a few minutes ago so rewind you'll find it yeah boy of course i'm out
when er is on but since he's here gotta tell him i loved his unbridled mare video also hi special
guest rag is hello glad to be here question for mola will you do an efap on movie bob's latest bs
video about episode nine question for e oh well uh i haven't seen it but if we can stand it this
is the thing we really not covering movie bob is a nightmare but maybe um i have never watched it
don't do it save yourself question for er have you seen black lagoon i have i think i answered
already it's pretty good uh shout out to the true avenger the guy who spoiled the movie and got beat
up brave of your boy uh did somebody do that did that happen wait say what shout out to the true
avenger the guy who spoiled the movie and got beat up i'm sure uh yeah fuck people who give spoilers
so awesome to see you here er this makes my day quick question are you still considering doing a
core book three takedown with the new live action series coming it would be the perfect occasion
uh there will be a takedown and it will be core related say that
do you guys think howard had questions for miss stark when their son looked like howard pot
howard the duck
oh i don't think howard stark would have noticed by the time he would have looked like the guy he
met for five minutes is where it's fine you guys are too amusing to watch keep it up thank you yay
the new thanos hadn't had to go through the same trials and tribulations in getting the stones like
the old one did therefore he doesn't have the same insight into what his actions do i agree
with that i don't i don't think it's impossible for thanos old to become thanos new it's just
that i think a lot of people really like thanos new so seeing thanos old being defeated isn't
it doesn't feel right to a lot of people i think yeah did tony snap prevent the last five
years or not nope it just killed all the bad guys from what i can tell yeah because he because one
of his things was he wanted to keep the family that he had yeah i'm assuming they actually gave
him that family just so we couldn't do the erase the five years thing because like we need a narrative
reason for them to push against that even though you know after removing someone saying do you want
to spoil game of thrones for me i literally don't care at all about game of thrones i do
you're wasting your time for me but not other people like i'm not a game of thrones person
i haven't seen one episode i don't i don't care about it oh yeah because it's probably airing
pretty soon i need to flee the stream after removing the armor thanos becomes a holy warrior
doesn't kill for the hell of it before taking off the armor he is much more cruel and punishing
thus final boss thanos in my opinion it would have been cooler if they had instead went to
an alternate universe to gather the infinity stones i mean you just gonna be able to explain
that in terms of technology like we figured out how to travel between universes like oh
but maybe you know thanos changes from a self-sacrificing sympathetic villain to power
tripping god tyrant villain he turns more one-dimensional emotionally kind of disappointing cool
scene though i think yeah i kind of i can see that take missed the very start of all of this
but still the gods have all gathered now you need to start solving mysteries in the efap machine
i'm not saying it's out of the question maybe oh oh oh oh can i be daphne
hmm yes but who can be shaggy the most powerful unit in distance oh hey uh
five out of ten will this be posted to youtube or elsewhere to listen to it another time yes
it'll be on the moolah channel with the rest of the efaps uh wish they'd develop the avengers more
as a family all along highlighting personal lives of tony clint etc left me with the thought
that in the end aside from widow the avengers were essentially just friends from work i mean
they kind of weird this is the problem is that they didn't have enough time in the mcu overall
to really do what would be a fantastic amazing story they worked with what they kind of had
which has been the case the entire time like the stinger in imm one like if you look at it it kind
of seems to be like a hey by the way can you throw a thing on the end so that we can try and
connect these movies in case they're successful and look where we are now it seems like their
priorities have switched uh several times through production and so if you could do it all from the
beginning which you know maybe they'll do it a more thorough job with phase whatever million it is
in that context i guess it makes sense why cap slash tony's reconciliation wasn't more
satisfying but i hope maybe they become pretty close friends
i think they kind of were and civil war split them apart but then they really didn't
recover in a way that i think needed to happen i don't know rags imagine if post snap only gay
fairy survived hmm well that's oddly specific i mean it's not impossible though is it
this was who poe what who's snap rags imagine if post snap only gay fairy survived
um well the stipulation that only gay furries were the ones who get to live
um the earth is going to have some issues the human race is going to have to uh going to be
on its last legs i'd say so yeah uh cap using mjolnir made me grin like a schoolgirl i think
a lot of people would have that way that shit was just like oh wow oh i didn't see that shit
coming but there is a bit of setup so i'm down with it i'm down with it 2018 thanos just wanted
the stones so he wasn't actively trying to kill them 2014 thanos was pissed at his future and
out for blood again i think that take his fear as well a lot of a lot of ways to sort of break it
down getting annoyed by cheering i had the one captain marvel fangirl next to me dear lord did
i want to strangle it oh did you cheer every time captain marvel came on screen because you'd
be like yeah it's like some stupid people will clap at anything i mean they're out there man
because that movie made a shit ton of money right captain marvel like there's a lot of people out
there who i dare say adore uh that movie i feel like there was too many moments where a character
took off their mask just to talk to charlotte telling clint to give the gauntlet to him for example
yeah that's been happening a lot on the mcu in general and it bugs me you know it's for
actor recognition though it's like look at your actor we paid to have them we'll appreciate them
okay avengers assemble made me shake with excitement i think that's fair did you see how
would the duck come out of the portal i think he should have been given his own shot i think
just for everyone to celebrate oh i'm waiting for the the i want to see what howard's role will
really be in the marvel cinematic universe
er in a theater sitting like gendo eyeshining
basically gendo he's uh you know emagilian have you seen that i'm uncultured
hmm well that one you're gonna have to fix if you could make me watch any one anime what would it be
well not that actually would it be steinsgate i'm imagining yes i will i will make a note
and consider it right i promise you did on netflix i do not know i believe it's all on youtube actually
oh wow okay um ant man is in the van trying to short circuit it literal next shot shows
him as giant man on the battlefield is that true i don't know what apparently there's a shot
where i'm sorry ant man is trying to short circuit the um the van and he said the literal
next shot shows him as giant man on the battlefield oh if that's true that's awkward but i'd have to
that's an editing fuck up also why didn't he step on Thanos um why didn't a lot of people do a lot of
things i think it's kind of not really gone it's like Thanos should be your number one target
everyone go get him i guess you could say like oh they're busy with everybody it's like yeah
like maybe send captain marvel to him immediately because he actually says uh cap like says something
like uh carol we need uh we need your support or something like that he like puts his thing on
and i was just like just tell it a fucking nuke let's just go for him go go go go go
do you need to be worthy to hold stormbreaker yeah so Thanos actually grabbed stormbreaker
at one point in this movie do you guys see that remember i do not recall it kind of bugged me
because i was like whoa how is he able to do that but i guess they've never said you have to be
worthy to wield it so not stormbreaker yeah nobody said that so i guess it doesn't contradict
anything i'm mad enough to admit that from on your left i did not stop crying for even a second not
an hour after i left the theater it's okay to be invested in things okay i almost died inside when
plank was fighting Thanos i'm not even kidding dude i was so concerned don't do it don't you
fucking do it like if she just punched his heart out or something a bit like oh god
when the end came i wish spider-man would have said i don't want you to go
i don't nod at him saying i don't want to go i feel like that might have been on the nose though
feels too righted instead of reals is him all i really love that in-depth core analysis no problem
it made me rethink how i felt about core not just uh turn my brain off for movies and junk
i love everyone's content er make more stuff rag is review more games and molar much love yes
all right definitely something i can do everyone hates her hair in the comics too oh well
this is a question for any comic book nerd out there who is the most powerful avenger
i wouldn't know i guess i don't know i don't know what your other comics and a question for me
okay all right we'll leave chat to discuss that one um my sister and i both black females hated
the old female scene we said that scene sucked and was not needed yeah i don't think it's needed
either personally but i mean it seems like the infinity war one was much more tasteful
where it felt more like it was oh it happened to be the three girls well this one was like oh wow
okay uh don't question captain holdo and this is to go even further beyond
captain marvel's next enemies will be goku and veggie nothing can defeat captain model i'm i'm
actually concerned that they will have a beat shaggy at some point they have the rights to scooby do
right or they will eventually i'm sure oh yeah wolf is top orphan witness his bone density
captain marvel is d d reynolds of the mcu who's d reynolds don't know i don't know
also a lot of chat been saying thor is the most powerful avenger
uh captain marvel oh wait captain massive will save the universe from the patriarchy
maybe is it true that there's a version of this movie that captain marvel does more
it was only a rumor i think but uh who really knows wolf if you'd ate less pizza you could
cosplay pre-end game thor to be fair thor could have destroyed thanos's ship in infinity war he
was destroying the troop carriers that landed in wakanda with little effort yeah i agree and
if he had it would have been way more satisfying than the person who was invented a film ago
and i would have but i yeah definitely i would have definitely preferred that
i'm not ashamed to admit it i clapped i clapped when tony said the thing
i'm sure loads of people did tony kind of won with a dad joke
uh when did he make a dad joke he's made a lot of jokes dad joke i guess i am ironman
could kind of be no i love you a little cheesy i love you 3000 maybe is that a joke though
are either of those jokes that's the kind of shit you say to make people like me cry
um i am madea snap captain marvel really isn't all that she would lose to the hulk
easily in comic canon she can fly and shoot beams that really can't hit hulk
if she picked up hulk and threw him into space pretty sure he'd be dead right
or at least defeated yeah i'll wait for captain marvel movie where she makes secret nazi prisons
and jails us citizens without trial this happened in the comics i believe that's civil war too is
that they're summarizing it in like an interesting way but yeah i wanted to be the villain but i
don't think they'll do that so basically in the other timelines perspective thanos killed himself
vanished yeah uh hey er do you prefer the steins gate vn or anime um no actually the anime
every man just wanted to give you my free super chat well thank you you actually managed to get
my boy er on efap this really is the efap vision of endgame notes of myself watching this on moolah
after seeing endgame hey farmer don't forget to feed the chickens oh and er your video on the
anime trump slash obama fight made my whole year i yelled out validate here when chara praised her
chara chara i had no idea i yelled out validate her when chara praised him
yep they sure us superficially diverse i'm not sure entirely what we're referencing with these
things i'd argue that bucky doesn't want to be cap in infinity war it's shown he's tired of fighting
and doesn't really want to be involved he nuts up anyway but it seemed clear to me he was done with
all of it well he's carrying on he's got a tv show coming out with falcon so i wonder if falcon
will be called captain america where he's just gonna have the shield i have no idea what they're
gonna do with it for sure so yeah and i don't who knows but i i just think i think bucky would
definitely be more of a realistic choice but i'm i'm not sure well i guess we'll see what happens
in the show between them i mean i was game for the whole like gets to live his life as a hero
instead of a villain you know because of the name change he'd be like i'm not because everyone
nobody associates the winter soldier with like a good thing right now so i don't know we'll have
to see what they do couldn't he have just waited until he went into the ice and then went to live
his life with peggy while covering up his existence why would he want to do that though
i mean that's kind of what he does i assume all right i mean all he has to really do is just
live a a normal-ish life and not get not do anything too big that it draws attention to him
and he is discovered to be captain america also like he can still do stuff the issue is that he
can't be discovered and then have it be known yeah and i think that is what he did anyway
he did live his life while other cap was a nice thing i think it would have been an awesome and
profoundly matter if joe russo had instead talked about losing his brother during the social support
group scene i would actually have been pretty cool yeah i don't know if you guys know but the
guy who talked about losing uh someone and trying to date again in the opening scene that was um
one of the russo brothers i think it was joe russo oh i didn't know that okay i should
yeah that would have been pretty cool actually if he'd talked about he'd lost his brother in the snap
and they were really close or something like that i agree uh since cap went back to have a normal
life did he have super soldier babies with peggy i'm going to have more super soldier babies
two dollars for every nazi in this call oh that's all of us hooray i think steve returned from an
alternate timeline again i i don't want to say anything definitively i need to read into all of
it if i want to make claims because everybody has a different take and thinks that every take
is contradicting another take so it's just like i don't think it's working out is the point is
a lot of people seem to be concerned that uh whether what did cap actually do is going to
be discussed for a while i imagine uh captain america calls the 2008 market crash
let it happen two people equally qualified to become captain america and the black guy gets
the job sounds like affirmative action to be i don't know if they're equally qualified i mean
bucky is so uh i don't know i don't it's not that if bucky didn't exist as like a character who's
there you know it wouldn't be like i'm fine with falcon but falcon isn't a super soldier that's
an issue um so he'll have is he going to be like fancy gadget man is going to be
captain america is the gadget guy but mainly it's just because bucky's there
uh captain america voted for hillary clinton probably well a few moron in tf2
jack you use the device that transports him through time while retaining his special location
not memories of the other pilot doing this time for two i will i will save that for him for next
time uh ant man traveled three times and wasn't bored captain america invaded iraq for oil
where do you think the mcu would be if marvel messed up the first iron man also er oh wait
we'll answer that first uh i'm not sure it would exist or at least they would be trying to reboot
uh maybe where dc is pretty much well i mean dc had both the mummy and dracula untold it's
took him two whammies to oh you're talking about dark universe well well i'm saying as an as an
example it took them too didn't the iron man saved marvel studios because it was like suffering big
time i believe at that point i'm not sure i'm not sure so who knows maybe it would have killed it all
if that was unsuccessful and they were dissolved although bought out by disney earlier also er
when you shot on the mcu in your captain marvel vid you made more sad oh probably i'm sorry what
did i do apparently i don't remember you shitting on the mcu in your captain marvel video that
specifically and besides there's plenty to actually shit on in the mcu in fairness i i might have made
a cheeky comment here it's okay and it was good and bad yep no hitting dash wolf thought oh you
know i have to save that uh a lot of problems with cap would have been solved if he showed
up back on the pad as old man having fought for a better future in an alternate timeline
um if he showed up old and he explained that he actually spent his time as a different person
but he was just trying to improve everything you know he did his best to work with and improve the
society he was a part of while living with peggy would that have been more satisfying um i i think
it would be better i don't know because that then that also kind of cuts into the whole time travel
controversy how much of the effect is
should he be making that much of a positive act that we don't know how we don't know how positive
yeah we don't which is why i guess i think it might be better that you leave that vague
um if anything uh there were quite a bit of passing the torch moments that really don't
work you can also hear the board of directors saying hey make that minority thing now yeah
the thought one was just wasn't in the cap one felt weird uh they didn't do one for iron man
and guess who knows what else they're gonna do but um yeah it felt felt a bit rushed i don't know
yeah bokehontus
i honestly thought hawkeye was going to throw his bow over the cliff when they
tried to get the soul stone they never really defined the requirements for something you love
yeah bokehontus avatar and dances with wolf a movie yes um capped goes back in his timeline
but maybe gets thwarted earlier lives his life with peggy while still doing the mcu events just
my thoughts uh i don't really understand that goes back in his timeline but maybe gets thwarted
earlier oh thawed earlier sorry why would he get thought earlier though um yeah i don't really
shooting for there uh fmk captain marvel ray ryan johnson
so fuck barry kill captain marvel ray and ryan johnson
oh man
what was okay ryan johnson captain marvel and who uh ray ray ray okay i'd wanna
okay do we all agree that you killed ryan johnson no oh okay captain so it's captain marvel ray
and ryan johnson fuck ryan johnson why because i'm about to explain okay kill captain marvel
because who knows what else could and mary ray ray because then you'll get a fucker later
but why are you fucking ryan johnson because so i don't have to marry him and he doesn't deserve
death oh okay yeah do you have a take on this i'm not like i really want to fuck ryan johnson
there's some logic to that yeah that's how we operate on the efap
i probably marry ray i couldn't deal with captain marvel smugness yeah ray isn't like
she's not insufferable she's just kind of blank and i feel like if i you could provide a character
i could provide her with character and i could show her like the world and we could go
roller skating and eating yogurt on a park bench and all sorts of stuff that couples do you know
and you could like make her a human you could humanize her
all right at the end quill is searching for gamora on the map thor messes with she's definitely
alive i thought that was just that was up in the air the fact that he's searching for it doesn't
find her we don't know for sure but i'm assuming she's alive i don't know why she wouldn't
this iron man killed her which which is which ass is better brie or captain america
how's america america america's ass dude yeah that's america's ass i like the part with
stark's daughter at the funeral where it was brought up that her dad loved cheeseburgers
thought it was a nice callback oh that that was just a great moment great yeah i like that a lot
and crowns for every chin on the boy of soy i think that's we finally caught up to when we
were covering quinton oh boy you guys should read the an frank ex goku till the end of time fan
fiction um okay er is here is it a season finale already uh like i said mid-season finale i think
is what we're going for here because who knows what else season three is gonna have you know
hello all long time efappa first time coming in the chat just curious what you guys thought of
all the vitriol that mark hamill is receiving on twitter thanks for all the content cheers
um we did get to talk about it briefly you guys just look for that tweet if it's still up you'll
just see a lot of the worst yeah a lot of sequel fans are railing him for having admitted that
he'd like to see a scene in star wars where him and his co-stars got to you know speak to each
other or hang out that horrible man suggested that you'd have a scene where characters would
be together and i think he needs to adopt what a piece of shit yeah what a nightmare i hope he
dies i hope he vanishes from a cliff uh rags in a knockdown drag out fight between you and goose
who wins and how who's goose the cat from cat not me obviously i mean even if it does have the
tentacle thing rags no i no that's the strategy go inside the cat and then just explode i like it
burst out i will watch that movie before i'll watch captain marvel 2 i've never watched lord
of the rings or the hobbit come at me i'm gonna save that the wolf so that man really i mean you're
you're denying yourself if you haven't seen the lord of the rings hobbit's fine but lord of the
rings man oh we are blessed to be in a timeline where those movies happen why are you guys
complaining about the scene where all the women pose and then fight foundesses are you get to
look at women yeah major lee probably got the biggest hard on when he got to look at women in
the final fight all former team i'd think so hey don't so awesome everything was just awesome so
awesome so cool i wonder if that is his take maybe he did maybe he thinks it's forced who knows
hey tone why'd the furnaces have wooden doors tone that is that i get it i get it uh get mark
hamel on efap it'll happen okay soon i believe all ot characters should be off limits for the
bet you know they're already screwed over um the the ones that were off limits were basically just
the ones that we forgot about and then kylo because kylo there is no consistency to kylo
his character is inconsistency um so yeah who is this holder woman get her off my lawn akbar
yeah did y'all discuss how dr stranger's plot was missing uh missing
well he was missing for a lot of movie yeah i mean it would make sense because he's dusted but
yeah what are you gonna do when you're dusted i suppose um love your work er also liked your
unbridled rage yeah yeah thank you
mola i don't understand what's happening don't worry mola nobody watches jojo understands what's
happening all right a lot more um then there's there's three super chats two of them they're
all from the same guy two of them are blank and one of them says meme my doggo
meme my doggo i don't know how to respond to that do you guys have any advice i don't know
what's to do no one everybody no one ever sent me a that i checked the picture um are my email no
one ever sent that picture they were talking about so i don't know that was supposed to be a thing um
way behind on catching up at two times speed you said this is the most impactful event in
world history forgot that in the middle ages europe loses one quarter to half of the human
population so it isn't unprecedented also it didn't create a utopia okay one no this would be
way worse this is way worse because people are just snapped out of existence they don't slowly
die of a you know a problem the middle ages i mean there's a lot of functionality to society
now that requires active humans to take care of it at all times compared to the middle ages
plus there's seven billion people now yeah interconnected and live in a society together
that's very reliant on other people doing jobs and tasks i'm not saying that didn't happen in
the medieval ages it was just a much smaller very a much much much smaller version of that
the infrastructure difference between the medieval ages and modern times is almost incomparable
mm-hmm what was your take on endgame praise good mere battle raged
a combination of all of them if i'm completely honest with you
subjectively mostly praise with some exceptions um objectively kind of a mixed bag
efap wars rise of the er
horror is better than ang you got to deal with it i don't think i can
okay that's one for wolf i will save that we're up to or for wolf
why did you let your mods run tyranny on your server more like quite a few people were removed
unjustly perhaps you should address this properly instead of brushing it under the rug um it's been
anybody who gets booted on my discord for some reason think that like i will be able to control
it it's not my discord um it was created by me but the thing is i can't run a discord i'm way too
busy so my moderators do and then i just feed them information like when my next videos are
coming out or how to announce certain things um yeah at this point they've crafted most of the
rules uh if you break them then they will ban you and they run it as carefully as they can to avoid
bad things happening i would recommend joining it but obviously um just pay attention to what the
mods say because it's it's obviously they're just trying to take care of it as a little community
but um i have barely any input into whether people are banned or unbanned and i mostly only
check out chats every once in a while uh or pings like i'm just way too busy to be um
i can't i don't control the discord so so much point in coming to me about it but uh
if they're running a tyrannical discord i'm sure it's better than no discord
you got that and you can always start your own mauler fan discord if you'd like if you think
that they'd be into unfair and you'll probably get a bunch of people to join if if people feel
likewise yeah i don't know um what the issue is i haven't had an issue there i didn't notice there
i didn't know there was anything happening uh i'm i mean i know that people have been banned
from a discord but i'm assuming that's part of the course people get banned from discords right
but just yeah yep this must be the season three finale of efap where they summon the
grand i'm not gonna finish that they some of the grad wizard let's just say that uh it's lovely to
be able to stop watching for hours and come back to the fappage still going oh yeah how far are we
up to six and a half hours okay yeah we can't go for too much longer yeah because i'm i'm actually
gonna have to eat soon i'm getting we are getting close actually this has been insane we're getting
uh a non-event in endgame starlords return to earth do you think guardians of galaxy three will
fill in scenes preceding his apparent departure scene on the ship with thor
no honestly i think guardians three will probably pick up even like a week after they leave earth
or something there's a lot of things that are rushed well i think um i think his connection
to earth was mostly just his parents not yeah he didn't like earth itself as a place he does
mention um he didn't want to set foot back on earth because where his mother died i believe
something like that is said yeah because he could have gone back at any time yeah he could have
if he wanted to i can't watch this since i haven't seen endgame yet oh but wait oh but that kind of
creates the issue of if he can go back at any time then how come other like alien civilizations
haven't already visited earth many times you'd think that is that is a problem you'd think with
the freedoms they have and how crazy some aliens are you'd think we would have had a couple visitors
yeah is like is there one of those things where you're not allowed to visit planets until they
technologically advance to a certain state which would be cool but no that's definitely
don't happen to consider a captive bubble it's like you can just fucking do whatever you want
right on over so that's a that's and that's like one of those background issues that it's um
it would be nice to get a line or two about that but i think that's one of those things where
no explanation is way better than a bad one i mean yeah because it gets complicated if they were
like you never let me go back to terror and he's like no one can go to terror or something like
that it's off limits i'd be like huh do they have like a century blows up there's a century how come
blows up there's a century how come we haven't seen it is it invisible i don't maybe it's outside
the oat cloud maybe i don't know that's where the comments are from
can't watch this since i haven't seen endgame yet just wanted to say great work on the report
disproving the russian collusion mauler no problem trigger er wall mauler report yes
yes trigger er more please i only had the one video saying kora was great but we have him on
again i'll find another one make him nice and be another one his opinion is subjective and you got
to deal with it oh is er aware of alpha alpaca packs kora series yes i am it's very good everyone
should check it out hey nice to see the anti-social nazi man is here have any of you gentlemanly folks
played hollow knight if so what are your thoughts i really liked it i've only played a bit of it but
i'd like to play i haven't played it so i don't like it nor do i dislike it i i have no feelings
on hollow night there you go also how much do we need to bribe er into becoming a regular
rhino milker for all oh rhino milk for all now when you say rhino milker
yes that could mean a lot of things yes um i don't think er is going to become a regular e-fab
guy right now we can't even get a regular like fourth person at all once wolf is dead we'll
you know from pizzas we'll look into uh hiring yeah when he chokes on a pizza and dies tragically
we've got a backup we have a backup wolf er do you respect howard stern's penis
howard stern's penis
uh not quite just leave it at that i don't even know about howard stern's penis
see this that's why people call you uneducated like no offense i'm not trying to say you're
uneducated but a lot of people claim that thanks to statements like that how does that make you feel
empty him what i don't feel anything i don't know about anyone i don't know well i know about some
people's penises but not howard stern's uh chorus failure to address ammon's point about inequality
was a huge wasted opportunity benders were running protection rackets in the open correct
er do you care for the final act of the death note anime aka the light versus mellow and near ark
no i do not light another one very excellent theories but what can you do uh yeah the live
action movie was fantastic well i mean two of them japan were okay uh er what do you think of dragon
prince uh i think i went over that uh oh i'm kind of meh toward it just seen the first season
you read that one uh thoughts on the guy that makes the akbar voice i'm sure he's a good dude
he is uh i'm with him man
chill dude chill dude yeah who is your favorite anime body pillow
favorite anime body
ah that's choosing your favorite child again i can't narrow it down
um er thanks for keeping edgy content alive quite welcome i guess
does er really idolize adolf hitler well he's only my uncle yeah
family is blood is thicker than water guys blood thicker
y'all can you provide one fact about yourself that we might not know
so that we continue to flesh out the efap y'all law yeah one fact about i don't know
i don't know uh
uh yeah i really don't know that's okay narrow it down i don't think they will
what is something about you you think most people wouldn't know
well most people don't know very much about me so i guess um
um no i'm very tall in real life i guess he's a tallman tell us how to do it how tall how tall
a tallman six five to six oh wow wow you and fringy should have a battle i'm six four so
me you and fringy should make a band i'm five ten i'm fun side
well there you go add that to the lore uh hey guys i can't watch this yet because i haven't
seen endgame but i can't wait to watch it it's great to see you finally got er on how long are
you going to make gamutron wait i i've heard that he wants to come on but i really have no idea who
he is uh i'm about i'm about i'm about 16 inches tall in from work so we'll watch later if you've
not mentioned it what was your view on how endgame handled time travel because i feel they left a few
things unanswered uh hopefully you're able to if you watch this again at some point from work you'll
know exactly how we feel about it y'all how did you get so invested in steve and judo verse to
begin with uh i think i answered that one a friend enjoyed the show very much i thought it was silly
and took the piss out of it at their expense and yeah
we must secure the existence of our folk and a future for white children
sure these infinitely beautiful comments that to read them out is to just expel beautifulness
into the world er seriously reminds me of l from death note how are you going uh i'm currently
kind of sitting like him to be honest it's grabbing my legs yeah what was the first anime you ever
watched that would probably be naruto which i think was a first for a lot of people
yeah i hear about naruto a lot is it is it worth watching uh it's very very long very uh important
we don't we don't like long stuff here true true uh isn't one piece the longest one though right
is it the longest i know it's very very long i don't know about longest
definitely up there though yeah definitely
is diversity our strength and is jared halter gem
i know and yes piece of shit shadow vest he made a video recently about the time travel aspect oh
yeah we did i may have read that one out i'm not sure yeah what's your opinion on full metal alchemist
brotherhood very good first one watchable hey rags this thanos has seen every form
everything from nebula's recording so he knows about camora's death in that timeline so he's
lost her as well do we see him seeing everything i don't know that that's true because he doesn't
realize that she's betrayed him i'm guessing there's no reference to the fact that camora's
dead that he saw in the recordings i don't know you think he would yeah i think yeah it depends
on what they're watching he says i'd like to see everything but even then we don't know exactly
did you see every single thing that's happened to nebula i don't know yeah like you wouldn't
have had the time to watch everything because you could literally be impossible but hey yeah he's
trying to catch up on how much time a lot of it uh yeah would you rather have had ryan johnson direct
episode nine instead of juju abraham's um uh that's kind of a mixed bag actually because
i kind of just want sorrows to be put out of its misery and ryan johnson would yeah yeah
who would you prefer rags oh those two give me the options one more time jj or ryan
for the next movie jj yeah i'd probably go with jj i feel like you're gonna care a little bit
more if the goal is to create the superior film um i don't know what ryan johnson's doing when
it comes to writing it's not that jj is specifically better than him but jj doesn't
seem to want to recklessly murder everything to do with star wars so i take that as a plus
as a non-black i can endorse the idea that non-blacks think black should be slaves in fact i
think any non-japanese citizen should be a slave hashtag hero hito did nothing wrong
i liked how thanos was impressed looking at himself hero hito
i like how thanos was impressed looking at himself through nebula's memories i also agree
on efap movies avatar just do it we could do that um yeah well we've got we got a plenty lined up
the ones we've watched so far have been great oh as for um by great i mean they're terrible i
enjoyed that thanos was not put off by the fact that he was killed in the thing he was like that's
that's good that's fine because his job was done like okay with it so it was neat wasn't bothered
by being killed once the um i was legitimately falling asleep until i heard er say he's playing
persona made me jump out and happy good shit in civil war when black panther says vengeance
is consuming them and they cut to cap and tony fighting do you think cap was fighting out of
vengeance no not necessarily but tony's vengeance is consuming cap and tony in that scenario i would
say um yeah no both parties don't have to be you know in a state of vengeance the fight has to
happen because of vengeance i imagine that's probably what black panther was going for but
who knows maybe he thought that cap was trying to then avenge bucky's busted arm i don't know
hey er have you ever watched terraformers
a little bit a little bit
was it good i just never uh it was uh i didn't seem accurate i just didn't continue with it
what is your dream youtube project you would like to make but don't have time for right now
i guess that could be all three of us so how do you want to go
any video idea i have uh uh that's probably stein's gate to be honest which i won't have
to do eventually i'm sure but at the time right now i don't have it what about you rag is honestly
um i just need to do more video work but what i would like to do and i this this has been an
idea in my head for a while something i'd like to do but i'd like to do like interviews with people
like streamers and other youtubers and maybe people who work in industries who do
film and game stuff um it's like speed runners and sportscasters stuff like that i think it'd
be really cool to have like periodic interviews with people like hey come on i just we're just
just an interview about what you do and you know stuff like that how does the how does things work
behind the scenes no names and stuff like that i think it'd be like like a like a mini joe rogan
kind of i thought that's always been an idea of kind of having my head that i want to do later
uh green youtube project for me would probably be just getting all of my favorite media covered
extensively but there's a lot of them so um once i'm 90 ish i'll probably be like i did it
um the only problem with covering stuff i really like is that i'm worried about getting it right
you know like i'm gonna make a mistake captain marvel i'll be like oh no
not captain marvel anything but captain marvel i can't believe i didn't do that film justice
oh no um oh lord is there no help for widow's son i'm confused well that's referencing
she has a son widowson it's very possessive widows son but uh i don't think she has a
i yeah i'm not sure riddle me this er what is 13 but also 50
oh then again you have to go look at fbi.gov i am a cat guy but i'll make an exception for rags
oh good yeah that's high praise er do we truly gotta deal with it
nobody died we do
if i read too much of these out this actually probably will be used against people eventually
uh what do you think of sargon is that a question for er or anyone specifically
anyway any thoughts er or sargon i don't know him or his content that well personally um
but i've i don't know he seems okay i don't really know i think we me and rags have mentioned it
before on other reefers but uh i believe rags is friendo yeah i'd consider sargon my friend
and yeah i like i like a lot of his content i disagree with different things here and there
it's uh i tend to try and look at it as like for anybody who's like oh you fucking only watched
blah blah blah i just feel like i mean i watch all of h bomber guy's political content as well
so i don't know if but which one am i aligned to just let me know um i'll be voicing palps
in episode nine and i can confirm they refer to me as creamy sheave also spoilers ray and cap
ray and captive bar will team up and kill me right away
er is inevitable uh notice me senpies that's some weird guy you all notice some weird guy
yeah you've been noticed notice hello some weird guy infinity war and end game was just a plan dr
strange made to get tony killed for leaning against the cauldron of the cosmos changed my mind
that is the narrative right does anyone watch hotel artemis no i haven't even heard of that
what's that i don't know that uh yeah i don't know what that is interesting
guitar in your 20s er i see you're a man of culture as well
on tonight you got it high rags hello well how do you feel about alien isolation
uh i need to play it again but i i i really like the atmosphere and the world
being accurate so like alien but i got bored of the androids good god the androids was so lame
um so to give the game a good shake i'd have to play it again so yeah i just joined did you guys
like end game yeah i think we all yeah you er was 50 50 uh the the rest of us gave it a thumbs up
i i would say that i it definitely satisfied me um if i had to roll the dice
or like if you like take in game as it is or roll the dice and get a random new in game i wouldn't
yeah that's actually a good way to put it i'm not sure i'd want to roll the dice on that because
i've got a lot of things i like and who knows what it'll end up being it's like roll the dice
ryan johnson's ed and gay everybody no no no no no no no go take it back take it back i need the
time stone uh maula before you end the stream google Thanos and click on the infinity go and
look cool easter egg yeah i checked that out someone in the chat said that and i checked it
out and that was really cool yeah we will still leave alone yeah love the efap movies video you
guys did i'm looking forward to more you got to do bye bye man truth or dear or friend request at
some point bye bye man i've heard of bye bye there oh god some of these some of those shitty
teen horror movies we will put them on the list there's already a big growing list for efap movies
um oh man captain maula getting KO'd by Thanos represents how even a mary sue can't beat the
patriarchy checkmate captain mary did cap have to look at black widow's mangled corpse or do you
retain the stone god that'd be so awkward no i'm sure she wasn't there he probably just dropped it
and he was like anyone could pick this up i guess i don't know well where exactly was the um i guess
the soul stone just sort of appears to you you just have possession of it yeah and and the thing
about the soul stone what if somebody else comes up behind someone who gets it and like what does
what does the red skull guy say he's like oh no someone else is using it right now
when they're done with it i guess or like how does that work um i don't know that that's going
to be something we could answer it'll be i just i just want to know the bureaucracy of who gets
to the soul system like what if you wait till someone brings it back yeah do you have to wait
till someone brings it back until you're done with it what if two people threw one person off
who gets the soul yeah what if they both love someone
i just want to know how the soul stone gets back do you just hand it back to red skull guy
or and all the time he's been guarding it has nobody just showed up and thrown something that
they what if what if cap kept it and what you can do with it is make people fall in love with you
and that's what yeah how he actually got peggy no huh think about that huh oh yeah well who knows
what he did with the stones while oh what if he used the reality so what if cap used the time stone
there's so many things that you could do who knows uh er what inspired the jack saint joke in your vid
jake's it because he just the guy looks like him to me i just saw an uncanny resemblance
how did you find out about jack saints he's not exactly well known from mefap yay
you watched uh the one where we covered him was it yep wow good stuff
that was probably easier to listen to than it was to make
i don't have that tfa part three when uh to be confirmed but it hasn't begun work on it yet so
don't expect it anytime soon but it'll be coming eventually just stop by to say you should watch
jojo's bizarre adventure that is all lovey channels guys in honor of thanos what are your opinions on
stoicism um i think i think just like many things there's a time and place to be stoic
to to have moments of pragmatism but i think that you're really denying yourself a great deal of
joy and i mean fuck there's times where you should be angry you know yeah there are times
you should be angry there are times like there should there should be some times where you feel
like righteous anger inside of you uh the movie was great for what it was yes the movie has many
many plot holes but this was truly a fan's movie they included so many comic references i don't
know where they would go after this but this was a perfect ending given what the real life actors
i think they did pretty well considering everything um yeah because i mean you could
always do better but they had a lot of shit to do because it's quite the juggling act um
with all the actors all of the the powers the will the characters it's just like it's a lot to
deal with um but yeah yeah this movie reminded me why i joined the rat king covenant best covenant
in ds2 rat king in my opinion thul being a mess like he was after war he went through was a logical
possible outcome he coped with his life-changing circumstance like i did he it's not that he
wouldn't be depressed and uh give up on like doing x y and z it's it's like the
i i don't see the connection between that and losing faith in being a leader
yeah you'd be like well you failed to save the day thus it doesn't really feel suitable as a
leader and i should be like i don't know i don't think we saw enough of that uh through line
personally uh but yeah enjoyed endgame tony's iron man line was the best part of the movie
but captain marvel did not deserve to be at his funeral i agree
watching some tom cruise movies lately after seeing mission possible fallout which should
i see next minority report the last samurai or edge of tomorrow oh i'll make a here's one
here's one out of fucking left field legend go for that one oh you guys you guys have never seen
legend that's one of the first movies tom cruise did i've seen legend i love legend what a trip man
all right legend i know those three though i would recommend last samurai then edge of tomorrow
actually fuck it last samurai and then the other two i'm not sure uh if you should be one of the
other first but see all three of them go for it and minority report was the other one yeah
i haven't seen edge of tomorrow but i've seen minority report and that's really good
yeah he said any thoughts on these movies and how good slash bad they are i like edge of tomorrow
a lot but there's loads of writing tisms in it last samurai i just like mostly um but i probably
need to watch it again i haven't seen it since i was a lot younger and that goes the same for
minority report actually yeah i'm not the hugest fan of it because i'm familiar with the source
material really happy without a handle you're cutting out a little bit i said i'm not the fan
of it because i am familiar with force material not super happy with how i handled it for the
other two the other two pretty good uh love the character focus early in endgame tony slash neville
was an unexpected delight i think the film got bogged down in plot for most of the middle
i could agree with that uh saying odds in movies is just more movie science anywho
yes should have been thor and a keg sent to vormir that would also work uh should i see endgame
more your why i watched infinity war also guys oh well yeah i mean if you really like a lot of
what the mcu did i'd recommend seeing endgame um i can't promise you'll love it i can't promise
you'll hate it i don't know what'll happen but um yeah if you've watched infinity war you may as
well see the other half of the story i guess absolutely uh you guys's thoughts on into the
spider verse thought they really put effort into into it personally uh haven't seen it but i've
heard it's great yeah it's great i've seen it and i thought it was pretty great
round thanas thanos gets arrested for sexual harassment no but yes no it's tax evasion that's
what gets you if i got to pick molar and anime would be cowboy bebop dub i i can't have everyone
pick i'll do that i recommend it's a pretty good choice though me and echo sugar girls
i'm already you had me at sugar girls uh kick vic mars behind bars i was behind bars
maria hill ramming a mothballed helicaria would have been the ideal way of destroying thanos's
ship or anything else that wasn't captain marvel yeah spiderman goes back to high school five
years later but his friends are still there did they get held back well no they would have been
snapped i guess i'm happy that furor is here and they spelt it with an er nice just got back from a
30-hour drive and caught the stream love the content all of you make it looks like i missed
most of the show but here are some shackles well you'll be able to catch the full thing
probably tomorrow when it finally gets uploaded it'll take a while to process this one i imagine
recently played valkyria chronicle 4 and there is a doggo named rags in it had chuckle uh yes ragnarok
yeah he's a he's a field medic which is which is extra good because in games i typically play
support and healing characters because i'm a sassy power bottom uh captain america doesn't
know what twitter is that's why he had to go
oh because he didn't know what twitter is
am i missing the joke um
i don't okay then uh thanks er mauler i noticed a few years ago the quality of writing in the west
was getting bad you really have helped me better articulate this fucking great stuff if that's an
effect we have i'm pretty sure that is a net good thing though right assuming it results in good
things it's a talentless hack confirmed healer hey it takes skill to be a good healer and then
not only does it take skill to be a good healer but if anyone dies or if you lose the game it's
always your fault what there's a healer on my team that's that means i can literally do anything
and it's never my fault
killing a scared man just because he dusted 50 of all life forms is comparable to fbi agents
dropping by and busting you for pirating an episode of blues clues three years ago and then
cutting off your head um if you say so so i don't know how much of that i agree with
uh i think very little three percent of it two percent um i mean i agree with the point
that you can compare the two um it's not a very good comparison though that's a low key
if there is a young low key he's just younger low key will be alive and well yes doctor strange's
plot was about a lot of quantum stuff the capture the plot the plot of dr strange i
didn't like it all it was really a mess but i liked dr strange so i'm on board for another
dr strange but work on the plot and make um a cap trilogy through line was his friendship
with bucky so i think the perfect ending would have been for bucky to be the new cap also was
surprised with you till the end of the line wasn't used yeah cap and bucky's story wasn't
really in endgame really pretty given more of uh stuff yeah thoughts on the melancholy of haru
high susumi uh uh endless eight arc pretty good but if you gotta really have a high tolerance for
for stuck up little bitches to get through that show i gotta tell you so anime yeah basically uh
captain america went back and returned all the stones that kept correct so with him staying he
married peggy and lived a full life with her in civil war cap gets a girlfriend she's an
agent but also peggy's daughter incest i'm guessing she would be a different timeline
thing it'll you want to kiss do it's fine i'm going further than kissing here it's okay
nothing bad happened rags where can we get the dancing dog from your game reviews for meme purposes
so i have so i have basically i paid a an artist for zameras uh who does amazing work
to make like a dancing intro the part that i showed the part that i show in the exclusively
games little intro thingy it's only a tiny portion of that there's like a whole routine that i do
i'm not sure i kind of a part of he really wants to be the only one who has like the raw
files of it but for meme but you know for meme purposes you know i don't know i haven't decided
yet i mean it will eventually be on a main video like the video i'm working on now like the two
i'm working on now it's the intro like it's supposed to be like a consistent intro
but it'll have like text that goes over it and it'll have its own background and stuff
so i don't know yet i don't know if i'm i don't know if i put out the raw file
um i might though but maybe after i use after it's only mine for a bit
because if everyone uses it but everyone knows that it's me then you know that's one thing that's
fine i'm down with that but um not yet maybe later probably later but not yet
get hating christianson to talk about george lucas totally we'll get hating christianson on
next time um oh like do you think we can actually probably do that oh easily 100 i talk to him all
the time he lives what what what is what like but what's he doing these days he's pride he's in
movies i think yeah like movies that he's in they have names i don't know what they are though
so he's doing great i have to ask thoughts thoughts on soul eater
it's good i have not seen it
all right then uh avengers endgame and unbridled mixed feelings i don't i don't think that's
feasible as a as a day oh when it comes to feels oh fucking hell unbridled my feels aren't mixed
uh more thank you for making this exciting weekend in two parts seeing
avengers endgame and hearing ufaps reaction i really look forward to the same in december
oh yeah of course we'll be doing the star wars vision of this
oh fucking wait hey you want to come on for that one sure why not well we'll keep it in a maybe pile
because you might find it nightmarish who knows uh yeah you'll love jojo part two there's a third
right good guy stroheim that saves the day multiple times he even does a heil for like 30 seconds
what oh yeah someone should have told me that well um amala and i were talking earlier um
about like killing floor two and i said drip wire put put a german soul one of the playable
characters is anton strasser um who's a german soldier from world war two um and like that's
something not a lot of companies would do like they wouldn't even do that shit just having him
like oh i said no no we can't do that uh serious one for you i've been going through a rough spot
as of late and it's really been affecting me you guys bring me up and put a smile on my face
during the hard times thanks for that no problem will i i genuinely would hope that people get
entertainment out of us having a chat about media etc um and if this helps i really like the idea
that it helps people through like long work days because i used to listen to podcasts when i had
like really bad retail jobs so like yeah if i can provide that for someone that's that's
definitely something that's a boost for uh i've been there my dude that's the kind of stuff that's
good to hear helping other people through their day that's some good stuff i like that i haven't
seen the film but not so in love with the mcus to care about spoilers my only question is if
adam warlock shows up given that's what infinity war did in the comics he's gonna be in guardians
three from what i can tell um adam warlock yeah because he's baited at the end of guardians two
oh the the sovereign guy yeah he's in like that machine oh that's adam okay all right um you could
have popped up in endgame i don't know but yeah they didn't go with that i always thought earth
didn't get much space traffic because it's in the galactic equivalent of nowhere space like a fly
over planet also the new avengers are all superficially diverse what even are the new
avengers you just talking about everyone who's alive because yeah but like the avengers are a
group for a reason so um that's a thing that's uh i don't know uh but yeah them being on a distant
place in space like you could say that but i just feel like it's like it just seems unlikely if it's
completely allowed to travel into that solar system that no one really did unless everyone's
just fully aware that it's not worth it or something like what is a place on earth that
no one goes to because it's crap and out of the way about the ocean i mean there's there's
plenty of places people don't go to because there's no reason to go there i mean places
like the bottom of the ocean it's really hard to get there there's no point even to just
just say you've been you can take over there if you have good enough well i mean there's a lot
of town like even in america there's so much space you go to the especially the middle of
the country or the south they're just little towns and swamps and just woodlands where
nobody is and nobody ever goes yeah i was thinking maybe it's a bad comparison because like
is it in planets there's a lot of benefits you might be able to get as a space faring civilization
where you're like let's just go to that distant solar system that no one fucking goes near
and colonize it and they're like oh earthlings are here can we just nuke earth get it out of
the way and then a lot of things could happen i don't know er have you seen higurashi or future diary
uh yes it's a wild ride
uh he would have seen it he said search for references to infinity stones nebula mentioned
the soul stone when she explained gamora's death fair enough um i don't know if that's really
gonna give him the same experience though if he's finds out that gamora was sacrificed by
his future self versus him actually doing it if you know what i mean he was just yeah it won't be
the same experiences i mean maybe comparable in some way but it ain't gonna be the same especially
if he finds out they thwarted his plan because then he'll just be angry you know even more angry
potentially because the fact that he told that he did that but yeah no i understand are any of you
potentially looking for an editor to help with making your videos in any way i consider editing
intrinsic to my videos kind of yeah i mean it would have to be like a little segment of something
that i just don't know how to do but i'm kind of discovering how to do new things all the time
yeah i think yeah i don't think for me if i don't know how to do something then i
i learn how to do it or i find a different way of putting it in that's a weird one i don't think so
no still from zach yes still uh we're near the end by the way we go one two three four five six
seven left stoicism is a philosophy philosophy slash lifestyle basically you can control
you can only control yourself and your reactions to things it's not about having him not having
emotions but not being ruled by them yeah let's just being normal what i said about um i was
gonna say yeah the idea is that you know someone slights you hardcore and you remain stoic
sometimes remaining stoic isn't necessarily what you should do but sometimes it is or at least
that's kind of what we were trying to get at is that um there are times to be stoic and times
where there's not if you're saying like what's the value of engaging in stoicism at all times
controlling any and all emotions that affect you like well there's benefits yeah
stanley cameos are steve rogers in disguise yes what are your favorite movies everyone should
watch except for lord of the rings most places say short shank redemption is the best your
suggestions um my favorite movies masquerade i always tell people that um i really like um
the second like road warrior movie i really like the indiana jones if you haven't seen the indiana
jones movies see those they're great that's some good stuff
what about you young i'm gonna i'm just gonna recommend a one that i don't think many people
have seen it's a korean flick called company man i like that one a lot i think more people should
see it um my placeholder is usually terminated too i really like that yeah that's a good one
but there's a lot yeah oh god it's like where to even begin because if you start saying some you
start feeling like oh i gotta mention this one oh i know i gotta kind of mention that one too
for these reasons then you're like oh i better shut up um because you're keeping the dancing
dog for yourself rags i'm now communism your property is now the property of aka my property
for the moment because i because it's mine and i i paid for it and it was you know it's an
it's a fairly lengthy animation that's high quality i just i'm fine with other people using
it after i've kind of established that it's mine and people associate it with me that's kind of
the thing here that i'm going for but don't worry i'm not keeping it for myself forever i mean i'll
i mean i'll make file um i'll i'll put it out there eventually but um just just afterwards
i'm gonna wait a bit there's gonna be some time uh i guess i have to reveal my weebness autism
a question for er are you familiar with the fate franchise if so what are your thoughts
i am familiar with it i've only seen the uh bait zero and bait stay night animes
or anime and uh they're both pretty decent yeah uh it also says especially the original
f slash snvn if you're familiar with it i'm not familiar with the visual models no
no
and then you it's you know kagaku wasa kaiichi
hi you're gonna have to i have no idea
and then finally don't end the stream yet or i'm going to pull on my testicle really hard
i'm afraid we're coming right to the end it's just yeah we've been going for like seven
now man there's something to see though right i'm gonna have to show this to wolf i'm gonna
be fab as well but uh baywin has finished the next piece
you're not taking my pizza you know you're in there wolf baywin is going to try you

that that's spread into three parts yeah check that out you know it's unfortunate i really liked
your get out video and then it had to be booed because you're you're a racialism yeah how
unfortunate i feel like you changed a lot of people's minds with that one because
a shit ton of people thought get out was like oscar we're these sort of stuff yeah i
and but yes i mean there's this re-upload of it funnily enough yeah there is uh one
quite a number of views so yeah i mean you can still find it on youtube
