This one's not featuring Logic, because you've now been featured.
Now you're just a normal person.
Now I'm just one of you.
One of you lowly plebs.
One of the pleeboids.
I posted the album.
I'm going to show that first, because it'll be amusing.
You can see all the work everyone's put into making Kylo memes.
I'll be demanding memes without...
Wait, someone said, wait, why part two?
We gotta have part two!
Bing bong.
There we go.
I'm not going to call it part dose.
Part dose.
Parto number 020.
Yes, hello, everyone.
How do you do?
We're the exact same as the previous podcast, in terms of a cast.
So do I even need to do anything other than just move right on?
Let's just get into the video.
Can't do that.
Jump right into the video.
You should probably share a watch together, Link.
It's the same one you have planned.
Oh, OK.
I thought you had to reset your watch together.
Pay attention, man.
So if someone sent a video on playing it, you should see it.
Oh, God, did they actually make it?
Boom.
Oh, another one we talked about is a different one.
Oh, OK.
And then I'm going to showcase all of the art that was created.
The beautiful, beautiful art.
Oh, God.
Wait, did you actually play the video?
Oh, I mean, I did, but is my stream still up?
Yeah, it just buffered for me, so I didn't see it.
OK.
Well, I'll play it again, then.
It's just this.
It's dumb, but these are precious, precious memes.
I don't know if they're talking about that.
That's amazing.
Kyle Ben.
Some of these are really well-bayed.
Some of them are just fucking goofy.
Yeah.
What's that one?
That one is really good.
When they get the shading in, they get the lighting.
Oh, my God.
I didn't notice that one where he's looking down
at Bilbo on the table.
It's amazing.
I love the drawing one.
The drawing is still the best.
Oh, man, Jared.
Got some rhino milking memes as well.
This one, which I do not get how they photoshopped that so well,
so quickly, especially the cloak part.
Even though it's so arbitrary, how did they get that so good?
It's uncanny how good that is.
It's scary, but I love it.
Dude, a guy just tried to steal a mace during a parliament
section in the UK.
The emergency power one fits perfectly.
Steal a mace during what?
The emergency power one fits perfectly kappa.
What?
I mean, the kappa is just think of it as a smoking face,
but I don't know about the rest.
The emergency power one fits perfectly.
Oh, this meme.
Am I behind on the memes?
Do I not know the kids' memes these days?
I think, yeah.
He was talking about one of the memes.
Sony stole a mace.
That's amusing.
Anyway, I turned into an old.
You are an old.
This is true.
Is everybody in the wash together?
We're apparently missing one.
I'm not.
I'm seeing it.
OK, hang on.
We'll talk about it without you.
It's fine.
Oh.
Yeah, just let me know what's happening.
Wait.
I'll let the friend feel longer.
We'll play it for the audience, and then we'll
re-explain the entire thing.
So what he said.
It'll take us another 10 hours instead of five.
What you're saying?
This is the second week in a row where
we had to do a double eFap spectacular.
This is all I've done all day, by the way.
I woke up, and it was eFap time, and they're
like, well, part two, asshole.
You see, this is what Mahler does.
He has us kind of like we're chained in the basement,
and we're just desperately like, can we just
do anything other than watch a Last Jedi video?
He's like, no.
Mahler treats us like children on Kanto.
Oh.
There's a mace in the House of Commons
to show royal power and authorization?
Authorization?
Authorization?
Are you seeing this?
Author, total.
Author, total.
Can we review air supply music videos instead?
Air supply.
I mean, that's like.
Care?
I don't even.
Why would we do that?
That's what we were watching before the first stream started.
Oh, that's true.
That's true.
Yeah, and then you got me all excited.
We could watch the official trailer for the Avengers, too.
Or we could watch YouTube Rewind.
Oh, no.
I no longer like my own joke.
But yeah, my chat is jammed right now.
It's concerning.
Why is internet B?
Why is internet B, you know?
Oh, it's going again.
OK, whatever.
Anyway, does that work for you guys?
Yeah.
To learn about insta.
Yeah, I'm just making sure it's playing.
Script on December 16, 2007.
Wait, he's starting all the way over from the start
of the movie now?
No.
Adding what?
I think he's going to make several different points,
I suppose.
I mean, we can start over at the beginning of this video.
No.
What he's.
Second time's.
Oh, am I cutting out for you guys, or is he cutting out?
I can hear.
Who he is.
Rags cut.
Damn it.
All right, here's what we're going to do.
Are you sure you're on the right audio device?
Well, there we go.
Now he's gone.
No.
He's coming back.
Oh, he's back.
OK, let me know if this works or if it doesn't work.
Or if things are bad or good.
It's fine.
It's fine.
It's OK.
It's fine.
Yes.
Anyway, OK.
So he says, let's take it back.
This is the beginning of his conclusion, I guess.
Truth be told, I started writing this script
on December 16th, 2017, and have been adding editing,
deleting, tweaking, rewording, and otherwise just trying
to get this right since then.
I can't even tell you.
It's not a bad job.
I was going to say a little bit disappointing
if you've been working for that long on it,
but who am I to judge?
I take ages.
Who is that?
Who is that other guy that you guys covered?
I don't think I was for it.
That was the plot hole guy.
Oh, yeah, where he was like, I took this.
Like, no, he like he spent like a year or something
making a video, like nine redrafts or whatever.
I'm sorry, but my favorite one he ever did was Willems.
So I just jumped right to Willems.
Oh, yeah, that's the one most people know.
But he's the plot hole guy to me.
That was our first popular eFAB.
Free.
And then there was those two people
that reacted to the other Patrick Willems one.
And you have like in J, his response to Willems plot videos
200,000 plus or that copy.
Your microphone is poop.
God damn it.
Your mic was fine before.
Why is it so bad now?
It sounds like, would you guess lag guys?
Like how do erotic asphyxiation in between the two parts
or something?
Anyway, he's been tweaking, rewording,
deleting, editing, and adding.
That's what I've been doing with my part one for the TFA
series.
But I'll be interested to see what you guys think of it
when it's out because it's just there's so much shit in it
that I've had to carefully word.
But I still think I could have worded it even more carefully.
It's a little bit longer than 40 minutes.
A little bit.
Written about this movie.
Just kidding.
It was a little over 14,000 at its peak.
But a lot of that was because something would pop into my head
and I'd just add it.
I found out that a lot of the same.
How did it take you a year to write 14,000 words?
In the past year, I was going to say,
I guess he's been selectively tweaking it as opposed
to constantly working on it.
OK.
I have been writing a book for a year, a little over a year.
A year and two weeks.
And it's at like 330,000 words.
And I've fit YouTube scripts, a job, and college into that.
I don't know how it took you 14,000 a year
to write 14,000.
Yeah, but you didn't have to write it
to be airtight against Last Jedi haters criticism.
Yeah.
That's true.
That's challenging.
It's so challenging, it's impossible.
It's so challenging, he couldn't achieve it.
Some ideas come to me worded slightly differently.
A lot.
It's under 10,000 now, but still.
Whoa.
It's like reset for me.
Oh my god.
Did the same thing to me.
You OK, Rags?
Good.
We're good.
Good.
It was because something would pop into my head
and I'd just add it.
I found out that a lot of the same ideas
come to me worded slightly differently.
A lot.
It's under 10,000 now, but still not everyone
will be interested in everything.
What are the visuals for here?
It's about The Last Jedi.
People getting beaten up.
It's that movie.
It's around 10K now, but still not everyone
will be interested in everything I have to say.
So I have to put some time stamps in the description.
Everybody's interested.
Wow.
Time stamps for 40 minutes.
I don't even do that for my fans when I make like three hour
videos.
Sorry.
I have to say, so I put some time stamps in the description.
20% of you probably gave me a solid thumbs down
within the first five seconds and left a hateful.
I wouldn't even thumbs down this video.
I would just be like, it was meh, like a thumbs
down is as good as a thumbs up according to the algorithm.
It's not like I don't like it more than I dislike.
Right.
What?
Did you finish that thought?
Yeah, I did.
I said, I don't like it more than I dislike.
That was perfectly timed.
It might be a sensitivity thing on his microphone, baby.
I don't know.
That's funny.
Yeah.
Well, shit.
Unfortunately, the problem isn't fixed.
Like I said, it might be a sensitivity thing.
Maybe put the mic closer to your mouth if you can.
Well, that's the thing.
I've got everything.
I'm pretty much right in front of it right now.
And it's turned up pretty high.
I'm sorry.
Here's what I'll do.
Here's what I'll do.
Here's what I'll do.
Shut up.
So what I'll do is I'll restart really quick
and I'll be right back.
And you guys can talk about roses burning hair.
Nothing hasn't gone wrong now in that entire sentence
you just had.
Oh, good.
I'll stick around.
We'll tell you if it fucks up.
Great.
Comment because you think I'm devaluing your opinion
as a fan.
That's unavoidable.
That's not my goal, but I know some of you
will still feel that way.
So I'll just apologize in advance.
Rhinos.
Not arrogant or foolish enough to think
I'm going to change anyone's opinion.
I'm never going to not see rhinos on these things.
I'm not arrogant or foolish enough
to think I'm going to change anyone's opinion.
Gee, value the quality of your own thoughts.
And I have to ask, does he consider us arrogant or foolish
if we think we could change someone's opinion?
Getting back to rhinos.
When I saw that Rhino Photoshop,
I had to stop for a second because I was like, wait a
second.
This is fucking close, right?
And I was like, hold on.
Those things didn't have horns in the movie, did they?
Yeah.
It was that fucking good.
I was like, I had to actually stop and be like, wait.
No, that's not the actual thing from the movie.
I want to know how CinemaWins was able to Photoshop out
their horn for this video.
Had to go through every frame and take out that horn.
He must have paused every.
Oh, you did a thing.
A thing was done.
Yeah, I have to admit, that was a strange comment.
I'm not arrogant or foolish enough
to think I would change someone's opinion.
It's like, oh.
That's not my goal.
I'm confident in my abilities.
Yeah, I feel like I might change someone's mind on topics.
I know that I've changed people's minds because they tell me.
Oh.
Yeah, I bet every single one of us in here has done that.
Mueller, you and me did it with I Hate Everything.
No, that never happened.
Strike it for a battery.
It happened.
He just refuses to admit it.
But I know something.
You won't release the tape, and so therefore it is not real.
I can't.
It's against the law.
You probably get away with it law-wise,
but I'd say out of respect for I Hate Everything.
He's not denied it took place.
He's just said that he's not heard good arguments
against the film, which.
It wouldn't be cool if the guy says
he doesn't want to release it.
It would not be cool to release it.
Of course not.
Yeah, and there's also a legal area
where you can't record people and release it
without their consent.
In Britain, that's illegal, but you're in America,
and I don't know how that works.
Depends on the state, I think.
It depends whether you have like mutual agreement laws
or whatever they're called.
I don't want to look into that.
Well, ultimately, I don't think he'd sue you
because good God, how bad would that look for him in his life?
He sued someone because they released his true opinion,
blah, blah, blah, you know?
Yeah, that'd look really bad for him.
Feel that way, so I'll just apologize in advance.
I'm not arrogant or foolish enough
to think I'm going to change anyone's opinion,
and by all means, if you're here just
hate watching this video, know that you're
doing the right thing.
I'm not hate watching it.
No, we didn't go in hate watch, but some of your arguments
really did.
They were bad.
Yeah, Rags, you might want to restart now.
I don't know.
Son of a bitch.
By the way, this time, I might actually talk in this.
If app number two, whatever the fuck.
Do you feel energized?
I had a burrito.
Now I have a brain, sort of.
Excellent.
Well, that's for that because that's good because now Rags
is, you know, fucked off, pick up his fucking black lazy
bastard dogs.
Am I right?
I know.
Yeah, you know, I won't take it away from them.
There may be people out there who only watch the video
to get angry.
Yeah, I was only kidding.
I wasn't assuming that he was actually
talking about me personally.
I was joking.
I made a silly voice.
I support you.
I can let the hate flow through me,
and hopefully you get some catharsis out of it.
I won't even say that you shouldn't hate it.
It sucks that you feel Disney, Ryan, and Kathleen all
ruined your favorite characters.
And as much as controversy breeds views,
I'm not here to stoke the fire of that particular war.
Fair enough.
Even if I don't understand or agree with your issues,
you're allowed to have your opinions,
and you can feel as betrayed as you do.
It was a cheap move.
What you're not allowed to do is attack other humans
over a dumb move.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What does it mean by, what does attack mean?
I think he's referring to Kelly Marie Tran getting booed off
Instagram, which apparently wasn't actually tied.
We were getting insults.
Is that specifically what he's talking about?
The fact that he's showing here while saying this
makes me think that's what he's referring to.
But before he was talking about hateful comments and...
I'm really curious what he gets to with this.
Oh, wow. Look what he said as well.
Unfortunately, the majority of you need to hear that message.
Fuck you?
Yeah, a little bit, a little bit, fuck you.
Unfortunately, the majority of you that need to hear
that message will never understand.
Oh, sorry.
Nevermind.
Sorry, the majority of you that need to hear that message.
Okay.
And I actually agree with you.
Fuck you, fuck you retracted.
Yeah, we've retracted.
And I actually agree with that statement.
The people who were doing it are not going to have
their mind changed by you saying you shouldn't do it.
Yeah.
The little YouTube icon was in the way of the...
Sorry, that's not bad.
That you, Mark.
No, it's YouTube bad.
And the rest of us decent humans living in civilized society
will never understand how dumb you idiots actually are.
I mean, you said you didn't want to stoke the fire.
I really wish he had actually specified.
Like, if he was specifically talking about that instance,
I wish he had said, like...
And it also depends on how to drive stuff.
Don't, like, fire at the actors
hired to read the part out on the screen.
You know?
But he didn't say that though.
I'm curious what he means by attack entirely.
What if someone said to Mark Hamill,
I agree with you that the criticisms
of Luke's character are terrible.
Everybody clap your hands.
You're back and you actually sound like you're there.
Maybe.
We'll see.
You sound exactly like Rags.
Oh yeah, you do sound like Rags, actually.
I have noticed that.
I sound like his what?
No, not Rags.
Rags, I'm saying.
Rags.
Rags.
My human and I sound uncannily similar.
So who came first?
Who copied who?
Came first.
Anyway.
Oh yeah, you haven't missed anything, Rags.
All you said is that you shouldn't be mean
to actors and stuff for why you don't like a movie.
And the dumb people who do that
won't understand a message like that anyway.
So it's just like almost admitting
that it's redundant to say, actually,
if I may not behave.
Yeah, kind of.
But obviously, yeah.
My vision of that would be don't do it.
It's worth saying, just don't do it.
If you can affect even one person out there
in a positive manner, I suppose it's worth saying.
So don't do it.
Leave the individuals alone.
However, if said individual, like let's just say,
John Blumen, who worked on this film,
tweeted at Rags and said, I hate your coverage of my movie.
You're an idiot.
Then Rags is more than welcome.
Oh yeah, well I hate his group.
Rags can respond.
It wouldn't count as Rags attacking him.
He Rags defending himself.
You know, there's an important difference.
And that's happened.
Yeah.
It was with Zero, I think, was the YouTuber
where Ryan Johnson said,
whenever they fucked up on set,
they would say they zeroed it,
like in reference to the YouTuber.
And it was weird,
because the YouTuber wasn't even that bad
compared to like some of the other people
who would outlive the attacks.
As far as I know, that's all the information I have.
I probably don't have enough of it, but.
I mean, from what I've seen from Mike Zero,
not that I've seen a lot of his stuff,
he doesn't seem to be that negative towards Star Wars,
not like us.
Yeah, Mike Zero is a couple of people saying,
but, uh, strange.
If you followed me long enough,
you've probably seen me engage with some haters.
Because, hey, why not?
I'd say 85% of the time,
we at least end the conversation.
I thought they were haters.
He said that 85% of the time,
they end it amicably.
But it's kind of weird that he's calling them haters
if they ended it conversation reasonably.
It's almost like a,
it's like, they're just haters.
They're not really offer criticism.
Oh.
No.
You're a microphone.
Rags.
You're a fucking bitch.
Is every,
everything's back to the way you had it
before you switched it, right?
What's it mean?
Rag is?
Rag is?
Yeah.
Is everything back to normal from when you?
I don't know.
I don't know if everything's fucking back to normal.
What is normal?
I'm so sorry.
I don't know.
Normal is a construct.
True.
Psychically, no matter how angry or how many expletives
they call me at the beginning,
most people are just like not terrible.
Occasionally I run across some gems.
One commenter's excuse was,
this is the internet.
Is this your first day on the internet?
This is how people are on.
As in, as in arguing with each other
and disagreeing and being passionate about nonsense.
Is he saying the person said it's their excuse
of being a dick?
It's the internet.
That is how it is on the internet.
Yeah.
I have this opinion.
This is my opinion.
You do get people who are like,
I won't respond if you insult me rags
and possibly Wolflogic, whoever else might agree with this.
But like, I know I certainly,
if you throw an insult with an argument,
I'll usually respond if the argument's good.
I don't really mind the insult a lot of the time.
But it can be used against you, of course.
And yeah, to not expect it would be strange
when it is the internet and people are anonymous.
So they will throw shade.
You know, they'll be like, boom, boom.
And if people just straight up come in like, you suck,
you know, just flat out insult and nothing else, then.
Yeah, you can ignore them.
That's not even really a comment.
Like, when I go through my comments or tweets or whatever,
if I see that shit, I'm just like, it goes in my eyeballs.
My brain throws it to the side and I keep scrolling.
You know what I mean?
It barely even exists.
I don't know why people are so worried about it.
On the internet, is it?
I guess he said excuse.
I suppose knowing excuse for it being okay,
or like it should be acceptable or something,
but just expectation.
You should probably not be surprised
if you have it used on you, I suppose.
If the internet isn't just a collection of information
and people interacting with each other,
however they choose, every comment you type on this video
is the internet.
You are currently shaping the internet.
I want it to be an aggressive place
where people argue with each other vociferously
and throw insults where they feel it's necessary.
Yeah, I want it to be the fucking Wild West.
Yeah.
Is that a problem?
You want it to continue being accessible
of hate and idiocracy?
And then he puts a seek for his own spelling?
Like, what the fuck?
Wait, wait.
Sorry, it might be a bit after what I'm seeing.
Make it what you want.
You want it to continue being.
Yeah, all right, yeah, there you go.
Why did he put a seek there?
Seek?
Yeah, I don't know.
Seek, it's Latin motherfucker.
They pronounce the I like an E.
No, it's sick, S-I-C.
It is seek, it is Latin.
S-I-K, oh, I thought you meant S-I-K-H.
Wait, is it sick, an actual,
you can sick someone on something, something or something?
It's because it comes in the Latin adverb sick,
meaning thus.
It does not pronounce the I as an A.
They pronounce it as an E.
S-I-K.
Seek.
According to Google, it's sick.
Depends, depends.
It depends on what pronunciation of Latin that you...
No, I'm serious.
Now we're arguing about Latin pronunciation for fuck's sake.
Yeah, no, I'm right now.
God, first it's this water.
God rags, you're such a fucking idiot.
Don't eat all Latinas.
I took two fucking years of Latin in high school.
I hate you.
I'm banning you.
There's multiple ways to pronounce it.
I took zero years of Latin in high school,
so I think my opinion matters more.
Latin has short and long I sounds.
Correct.
Yeah, that's right.
Listen, learn your conjugation.
Every comment you type on this video is the internet.
You are currently shaping the internet,
so make it what you want.
You want it to continue being accessible
with hate and adiocra.
I mean, is he advocating that we should never
insult each other ever?
Someone in the chat says Latin isn't a spoken language.
Motherfucker, you can speak it.
Well, you can speak parts of it.
I mean, it's not currently like the official language
of any country at the Vatican.
Yeah, everyone speak Braille from now on.
But we know how Latin...
We know how Latin what?
Latin is implied.
Latin is implied.
Oh, guys, I know how to speak Braille.
If we all get bubble wrap, can we just like pop all
the bubbles in the rough shape?
Here we go.
Oh, if it means Latin is no longer in use
as a mainline language, like I can agree with that,
but it's certainly able to be spoken, is what?
Whatever.
Percy, make that your legacy, I guess.
Or people are typing in Braille now.
Hey, Wolf, you could just be not terrible.
Have you ever thought about that?
No, it honestly never crossed my mind, I gotta tell you.
Latin is implied, Kylo Bad.
Not terrible.
To the same degree, I've witnessed so many threads
under my video's turn from cursing and hatred
and name calling and belittling to a polite conversation
just because one person offered the tiniest apology
and acknowledgement that the other person is indeed.
We expect your apology.
Bloody hell.
For this video.
Speak cursive.
Just the idea that he's like, these people recognize
that they're speaking to other people.
It's like, that's good, they should,
people should do that more, I guess.
Yeah, good.
Like, for example, you can still insult someone
while recognizing they are a human being.
I've actually, I have to reference this basically every time,
but I insulted Wolf in one of my first videos
before I met him on The Last Jedi.
It wasn't, it doesn't mean I was promoting hatred
and idiocracy.
I just consult.
Yes it is, no platform for fascist.
Oh.
What is this?
Most people are decent tested out for yourself.
Another person.
Okay, dad.
Have you ever read Destiny subreddit?
No, not all.
Yeah, I didn't hear any of that, right?
I said it.
That's what you get for picking on ER.
I didn't hear any of it.
You went, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Ah, it's okay.
I heard Destiny subreddit.
Are you talking about the person, Destiny,
or the game, Destiny?
Yeah, because the ER stuff.
Oh, okay.
I'm guessing Destiny is saying something
just abhorrently stupid that I don't want to watch.
I know people from the subreddit.
Oh.
Kotaku in it.
Oh man.
Thank you, what are you saying?
I don't know.
Fuck and shit.
I don't know what it is.
God, you're worse than Fringy on a good day.
Here, here's what we'll do.
Give me a second.
Give me a second.
Is this whole half of the video just going to be
about being nice to people on the internet?
Well, so far it's been nice.
Yeah, I'm curious where this is going to go
because I agree with him,
but I don't want to put like a gauntlet down
and say no insults.
Does eFap have a sub?
We have a, there's a subreddit for molar, I think.
There's no one really there yet, but you can go.
Hear me?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
Hello.
I think I can.
Oh.
Crash.
Yes.
Lords.
Hello.
Oh.
What?
Loogs.
It's my question.
What?
Okay.
I don't know what you're saying.
Oh my God.
Oh no.
I'm afraid your microphone is still tisming.
Son of a bitch.
Rags, have you run a speed test?
I'll do that now.
That is so bad.
It always, every significant word
is what gets blocked out.
I'll do that now.
No.
The video gamer 07 says,
lu-jigged.
Yes.
Oh, you know what?
I can read some super chats while he's doing that.
Hey, logic, long-time fan,
you and Undoomed, the last of the old guard atheists
I still sub to.
I truly enjoy Bible Reloaded.
Wait, I truly enjoy Bible Reloaded
becoming regressive as hell
and blocking everyone like Steve Shives.
Wait, does Undoomed actually,
does Undoomed actually make like any videos
about atheist stuff?
I don't know.
I didn't know that.
But anyway, the thing about Bible Reloaded,
I didn't know either.
I haven't watched Bible Reloaded.
I'm not gonna comment on that
cause I don't know what Jake has been up to
or Hugo's been up to as far as blocking anyone.
So I'm just not even gonna touch it.
Fair enough.
That's really disappointing if that's true
cause I liked those guys.
I haven't watched them in a while.
I've known those guys for fucking years.
I don't talk to them too often though.
So I don't know what they're up to as far as that.
Hello?
Hello.
It was blocking policy.
All right, you give it a try and see if it works.
Oh no.
Fuck.
It literally came out as a try.
Yeah, and I, from hearing it,
I can't even recommend anything
cause it could be sensitive.
It could be the internet.
It could be like a faulty connection.
I don't even know.
Rip Rags indeed.
This is for Rags to support his alcoholism.
Uh, on my channel, I'll be doing a film series.
Do you mind if I name it after you thinking?
Dude Rags, your ping sucks.
Oh dear.
Hugo and Jake,
one of their latest videos doomed trash.
Wait, what did you say?
Sorry.
One of their latest videos is undoomed as trash.
Say they took on Jordan Peterson about 87 times.
Okay.
So we're going to give this another try
and we are going to see if all of the words
are clearly enunciated from my mouth
and are understandable clearly
to all those who care to listen.
It sounds good when you speak that slow.
I was just saying that all worked.
I'm hoping it's.
Very well.
I will speak at a slower tone
in order that all of my words are understood clearly.
They sound like text to speech.
Also, the Bible Reloaded did turn super regressive
and bitchy.
I stopped watching them quite a while ago.
Now they're called Hugo and Jake.
I guess they rebranded.
I feel bad for logic.
Stay neutral, my friend.
Stay neutral.
Logic.
I'm not even, I'm just not even.
Mm-hmm.
No, it's fine.
I'm in the same position.
I don't know anything about it.
Well, we know you're odd.
Huh?
You know what?
No.
That's a lame joke.
That was so lame.
It took me a while to even understand
what you were getting at.
I still don't get it.
That's because you're, that's, hmm.
Anyway.
That's all right.
That's a math joke for all our kids.
It's for kids who know about numbers.
And Latin.
Fucking magnets.
How do they work?
I don't fucking know.
Oh, shit.
Anyway, Alex Barker said,
he wants to make a series of videos named after me
and he said, is that okay?
It's about how I think critically that's fine.
You welcome to do you.
My good sir.
Roses are red.
Their stems are twisted.
Bend over, Wolfie.
You're about to get fisted.
What the fuck?
That's a super chat.
I don't know.
Rags, was that?
Someone put that to a nice beat.
Rags.
Did you write that?
No.
No.
Is that your doing?
You got something to translate.
Logics, rags, go.
You know Latin.
Roses are red.
I have poor grammar.
This guy hates time pedophiles and beats them with a hammer.
I don't have any.
Do you two even realize you're both speaking at the same time?
No.
Roses are red.
Sugar's used to sweeten.
Gordon Ramsay's dwarf porn star lookalike
found dead and badger didn't have heat.
What?
Where did you get that from?
Come on, put that in the same song.
Oh, you guys are weird.
Roses are red.
Violets are blue.
If the DNA test proves you're my sister,
I'll stop sleeping with you.
Oh God.
I think we're past that point
where we're all like completely exhausted
from fucking last Jedi video.
Oh, I mean, well.
No, we got this.
We got this.
We got this.
We got this.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Decent, test it out for yourself.
This comment section will be a great place to do so.
Be nice is the summary.
I hate the last Jedi because it's shit.
Hate me.
I don't hate you, cinema wins.
You're a nice man.
Yeah, I don't hate you personally.
I don't like your video, but I like you.
I hate you impersonally.
He seems fine and I don't think,
I think he's just trying to be a positive guy
about the movie and he wants people
to be nice to each other and that's fine.
That is fine.
Just don't think his arguments for the movie
were that great, but fuck it.
Who cares?
Maybe he's gonna have more.
Look how much time we got.
It's my channel's tagline.
Liking things is more fun than not.
I didn't know about that.
More fun?
Liking things is more fun than hating things?
I don't know.
I don't know, man.
It's fun to go on the YouTube
and just watch people shit on things.
I'm not sure I'd prefer to like everything.
Maybe nobody wants to always watch people
just being like, this is good.
I like this.
Let me tell you why I like it.
It's fun to just rip into things, you know?
I think it's fun to, you know,
it's a bit of a catharsis when you hate something
or you fucking were annoyed by something
and then you figure out what's wrong with it.
And that's fun.
So, you know, maybe it's more fun for him, I guess.
Choosing to like things can also be more fun,
as in, yeah, this movie happened.
And I'll take it a step further.
Choosing to like things can also be more fun.
How do you choose to like something?
Yeah, that's like choosing to believe something.
Well, I think basically what it is,
is that you say, that kind of sucked,
but I really want to like it.
So I'm going to spend a year writing 14,000 words
about why it's good.
Well, hey, he lowered it down to 9,000.
Ah.
Yeah.
As in, yeah, this movie happened.
As of right now, Ray's parents are nobody,
Snoke is nobody,
and we could have been hyperspeed ramming ships
for like ever.
I know some of you want this movie to not have happened,
but it's in there now, man.
It's can't happen.
Why is he saying that?
Like it's, yeah, that's the problem.
It being canon is the problem.
It's like he's saying admit defeat.
This movie's terrible and it's real,
and you're going to have to just own up to the fact
that it's real and canon,
and you should choose to like it now.
Me and Wolf wouldn't have responded to it
if it wasn't canon.
That's the whole reason.
Like, yes, you're right.
What does that have to do with,
it's not a counter to anything.
I'm not the first to bring up an-
Resistance to Disney's authority is futile.
You know what, he's right.
Pyre receives this.
Just kneel before Mickey.
Gaving reviews when it was released in 1980.
I hate this argument.
Empire got mean reviews when it came out.
But this other movie 40 years ago.
Well, it's just the idea.
It's like, this movie's a 10 out of 10.
This movie's a five out of 10.
This movie's a zero out of 10.
All three of them got bad reviews.
It means they're all the same, really.
Like, no.
But I don't hear many people talking about why.
And I think the main reason
was that the trilogy was not complete.
The same thing will happen with The Last Jedi.
The Last Jedi is the end.
It's like a duology.
I am so curious.
Like, what do they think the third movie in this
is going to actually change so much
that it will recontextualize The Last Jedi
as a brilliant masterpiece like The Empire Strikes Back?
The Last Jedi closes out like episode six does.
Where everyone's like doing that pose.
Everyone's like, yeah, we did it.
Yeah, where everyone jumps in the air and it freeze frames.
Yeah.
If it was the end of episode nine,
I would be like, yeah, they're going to do another trilogy then.
Because this story is tied up now.
Even though it was a bailier story.
But yeah, it's a duology
and it's going to have a part 2.2 or some, you know,
like that's what episode three is going to be.
Well, episode nine, sorry.
Once we've moved on to another trilogy,
the kids watching these movies will immediately accept
that astral projection, space flying
and telepathic conversations are cannon-
The argument isn't that they can't be.
The argument is, oh God, they are.
Yeah.
Like I said, we wouldn't be addressing these things
if they weren't cannon.
We understand that they are part of the law
and it contradicts other parts of the law,
which makes the law fucking broken.
I wouldn't even necessarily have a problem with those things
if they actually like had some justification for it
in the script.
Jordan Peterson just tweeted out Sargon's subscribe star.
Wow.
Damn.
Wait, subscribe star?
Yeah, subscribe star is the Patreon alternative
that he's using.
Is Jordan Peterson using it?
I don't know.
But apparently there's,
because I'm seeing some tweets in another discord,
like Matt Christensen, he was saying,
he posted the email he got back from Patreon
and they're clearly worried about losing people.
And Christina Hoff-Salmers retweeted Claire Lemon,
who was talking about how Patreon's clearly worried
everybody, it's brand damaging,
Patreon knows it and they're showing it
and everyone I know is talking about leaving.
So this is interesting.
You done fucked up, Patreon.
You done fucked up.
Don't put that in a video title, it'll get demonetized.
Yeah, yeah, dude.
Oh, I guess, were we live when I told that story?
When I explained that?
Maybe I'll put it in a video.
Yeah, there you go.
I'll put it in a video.
I'm a pro at course powers and part of the lore.
As map has pointed out,
while theories may have created the fan response,
someone watching this movie
for the first time even in say five years
won't have read any theories
and won't be invested in the plot threads
that don't actually occur.
That's not, that's a straw man.
What happens, happens then.
successful by that logic
because if you take one of 100 fan theories,
then 99 are gonna be disappointed.
Not predict anything either.
Not before.
When the Emperor's after series,
see this feels like bad faith to me.
He should be fully aware that people don't have a problem with it existing.
It's contradicting. That's the problem.
It's not the fact that it exists.
Yeah, after if you're making if you're in the Star Wars sphere,
surely you've actually listened to people's arguments, right?
Like drafted this early.
How did you get this point?
I see it brought up a lot in the chat.
Who's Matt Pad? That's game theory.
Game theory, film theory, that guy.
Oh, did he get reference?
I have not seen a TLJ video, but I think he made the argument
that fan theories helped to ruin the Last Jedi, I guess.
Oh, OK. Oh, he could be wrong.
Luke, in the last 10 minutes of the last film, I said, Whoa, cool.
And honestly, I was a little more enthusiastic when Luke Force projected himself.
Thank goodness not all the rules have been written.
Yeah, but some rules have been written.
Yeah, there you go.
That's the counter.
Go against old rules.
First, it's like we don't have a problem like the rules of chess
have changed over time.
We added like castling and stuff like that.
It didn't contradict any old rule.
Does force projection contradict anything?
I don't know anything it really contradicts.
The issue that presents is that there's a lot of ways
the Jedi could use it to their advantage if it was something they could pull off.
What I'm willing to forgive is the idea that it takes
an extremely powerful, potent Jedi.
But then again, you're like, man, Yoda, you could have done this
in the O.T. to help out.
Yoda seemed to have his own little special ways of doing things, though,
I have to say, like that's not good enough.
He wanted to win. He was very invested in winning.
So if he had this opportunity, he should be using it.
If he if he was so invested in winning, maybe he should have
fuck off his jungle planet and gone and fought Darth Vader or something.
I mean, yeah, but if you can force project, that's even easier.
Yeah, it is easier.
Maybe he did. Maybe he was like wandering around the Death Star.
Maybe like maybe he went
when they were drawing off the blueprints for the Death Star.
And he was just like, I'll just put in a little
a little ventilation shaft right here.
And they can see the laser.
I'm anticipating JJ try to plug these holes.
I'm like, this is really bad exposition.
It's kind of funny because I can imagine Yoda force projecting himself
onto the Death Star and like getting lost.
And he has to like, he's wandering around trying to find the throne room
and looking at little maps on the wall and going up and down the elevators.
I'd like a trooper sees him start unloading a blaster.
They're all going through and he's like, where do I go?
Could you not do that?
Where's the bathroom?
Where go do I?
But yeah, like I must.
They talk to him and episode died.
They're like, man, it would be useful if you could use that lightning
used back on Luke's island.
And then he's like, I couldn't do that because that was simply an illusion.
The building was never burned.
And I simply made Luke see that through the force.
And they just have lines like that throughout episode nine.
Just like, yeah, but you would just be like.
You could use that to contradict things in the.
Yeah, you'd be like, why could you make evil people see things then?
Or something? I don't know. It's just like, yeah.
Though I guess technically this one wasn't a Jedi book somewhere, so, but yeah,
he's talking about Ryan Johnson, but that was Disney canon.
So it doesn't count a Disney book.
It's like it's like reference that I'll use something else.
It's like, go ahead.
This is true because it's in this book.
This book is true because it's in this book.
And this book is true because it's in this book.
It's infinite.
Don't limit the force.
Why would you want to do that?
How sad would it be if you had to do that?
Why would you want to do that?
How sad would it be?
Yeah, because that's what everyone's asking to do.
Limit the force.
Yeah.
That's what you've been saying this whole time.
That's the fairy.
That's the fair representation of you.
Everything that could happen has already happened.
It's not what anyone's saying.
Is that what anyone's saying?
Yeah.
You would think that if you're a Castilian,
however long time you would have been like,
let's make sure that the things I'm saying are actually countering things
that are being said at the force.
Why would you want to do that?
How sad would it be if everything that could happen has already happened?
So, yeah, I'm going to defend this film.
And I may seem a little annoyed at times because the hyperbole
around this film is just plain out of control.
I can say that about your video.
Yeah, you have to explain how it's hyperbole.
Really?
Explain how it's hyperbole.
I want you to defend this fucking bomb sequence.
He'd say it's subjective and then I'd say,
well, you're using hyperpibaly over defending it.
And to be honest, you're plain out of control, cinema wins.
You're plain out of control.
Hyperbole is kind of like...
Do you remember that movie?
I think it was like the people versus George Lucas
and there was those people singing that song about George Lucas
raped my childhood.
What?
Oh, okay.
That's hyperbole.
Yeah, I agree.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But no one thinks that he actually raped their childhood.
Well, no, obviously.
But even in the non-literal sense is incredibly hyperbolic.
Yeah, it's hyperbolic.
And if people say that shit about Last Jedi, that's hyperbolic.
Last Jedi literally raped me.
Do you guys agree that if you invent scenes in the film
in order to argue for its quality, you're being a bit hyperbolic?
Say what?
If you invent scenes in the film in order to defend the film,
you're being a bit hyperbolic.
Yes.
Is that really hyperbolic or just disingenuous?
Well, they're exaggerating the film is what I would say,
the quality.
I mean, I think it would be disingenuous either way,
whether or not it's just understood as being, you know,
that in a negative light.
They'd be hyperbolic about the quality of the film.
Would you agree with that?
I'm not really sure that I would use hyperbolic there.
I think that if they have to invent scenes that didn't really exist
I think it can be hyperbole.
Yeah, maybe using the wrong context.
Hyperbolic refers to the word you're using for description, right?
Yeah.
So it would be hyperbolic to say the film is incredible, I suppose.
Or even good.
I would actually argue that's exaggerating the film to say it's good,
as in well-made or well-crafted.
Yeah.
I think hyperbolic could be like,
this is literally the greatest film ever made type of thing.
But then that goes both ways.
Is anyone saying, like me and you, us aren't saying The Last Jedi
is the biggest sin man has ever created.
We're just saying it's a bad film.
But again, we don't know what he's referring to.
He just said it's hyperbolic, he's out of control.
Yeah, it's vague.
It's just kind of somebody said something.
So it's kind of unclear, yeah.
Even in my own comment section, there are some repulsive takes.
Every repulsive you say.
Like what?
I don't know, he's probably referring,
I would assume he's referring to stuff like,
I hate that there's women in the film.
I mean, Major Lee seems to think people said that as well, so.
Every time someone even so much as requests The Last Jedi,
there's at least a couple comments telling them how dumb they are.
I'm not trying to give these people their 15 seconds so you can look for yourself.
I've already said, no one can take the look of the original trilogy away from you.
Yeah, they fucking tried.
They tried.
They fucking gave it their best damn shot.
Oh god, people changed.
That doesn't mean Luke was secretly like this all along.
People changed.
People changed.
See, people get old too, guys.
That's another difference.
Yeah, people just fucking changed.
We don't have to explain why or show why or give screen time to why really
or put in the effort into showing us how.
No, you just changed.
I mean, Luke was secretly like this all along.
And I'm not trying to be dismissive.
These are just some of the immediate thoughts that popped into my head when the outrage began.
I don't think anyone foresaw how far the outrage would reach.
Anyway, on to the movie.
I want to start by saying that, for me, this movie is a statement about our heroes.
More accurately, how we perceive our heroes.
The legend of Luke Skywalker.
Outside of the countless books written about Luke between Return of the Jedi and this film,
we only have the movies.
Yeah, but those books were like awesome, Luke.
He does all sorts of shit.
Well, now they're not canon.
Now they're not canon, so fuck that.
Now we get mopey, crappy Luke.
Look at those stories.
He said Luke discovered Jeb Bush and lost all hope.
And the superhero status that Luke sweeps the next German election was elevated to in the years between.
He's better.
The superhero status Luke was elevated to in the years between.
No, he was pretty much just doesn't need to be superhero, just hero.
He was a war hero.
Yeah, and he absolutely was.
He saved the galaxy.
You can't understate that.
He defeated Darth Vader.
He defeated Darth Vader and the Emperor.
A lot of stars will probably throw that in.
He blew up the Death Star twice.
Fucking Death Star.
He helped with one of no.
Yeah, he blew up one and he defeated the.
He only blew up one Death Star mauler.
He blew up the Death Star using the superpower also.
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
So he actually is a superhero.
He kind of is a superhero.
Yeah, because of the Jedi.
Yeah.
Well, well, I elevated to in the year.
Were the Jedi of the OT?
Were they considered superheroes?
Well, I was about to say everyone has the force now.
So maybe that's not even super.
That's just normal.
Yeah.
Like even Watto was like your force tricks don't work on me.
Like it's an accepted part of the universe.
Yeah.
But I think that they're clearly above the abilities of a normal human.
Right.
Yeah.
Like most people aren't in tune enough with the force or whatever to be able.
All right.
Yeah.
If you want to play that way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Return of the Jedi in this film.
We only have the movies.
If you look at those stories and the superhero status,
the games and the comics and the TV shows.
That's true.
Those are Canon.
There's, there is Canon outside of the moon.
There is.
Yeah.
To in the years between his current attitude is a direct statement against
that.
He's just a man.
He got some really lucky breaks was born into a boy.
Oh boy.
Wow.
Way to fucking devalue Luke is a guy who just got some lucky breaks.
He made a lot of choices.
He worked hard.
He loved well.
These are all things that aren't related to luck.
Yowzers.
Born into a powerful family.
Oh no.
Listen, listen.
A powerful family that had nothing to.
Left him in a desert alone.
Who's that really fast sprinter?
Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world.
He just got some lucky breaks.
He didn't have to like constantly practice and practice and train and train
and go through the hardships.
No, he just got some lucky breaks.
Also, I don't know if people actually want us to explore this more, but
use it.
Having and using the force should absolutely be considered a fucking
superpower in the universe.
Star Wars considering the sheer large amount of people who don't have it.
I understand that if you have a guy who's like a super ninja and has like a,
let's say a, a, a, a, a mace on a, on a line, he spins around.
It was like, whoa, it was amazing.
It's like it's superpowers.
Not quite the same suit.
They literally have telekinesis and mind control.
And if it wasn't the super power, what would have been special about the kid
like force summoning the broom at the end?
Well, there's nothing true.
We've just been some kid like getting the point of this film though,
that everybody has it.
No, I don't think so.
Yeah.
But it's Watto may be immune to mind control, but that's only because they
say the strong minds don't get affected by mind control, not because he's a
force user.
I thought it was because of his species.
I thought his species was immune to the force influence.
Um, maybe again, I, I, I'm not 100% sure.
Actually.
Uh, uh, it says they,
they're known to be strong willed and resistant to manipulation through the
force. They are Toydarians.
Yeah, I guess it is the species then.
Does Watto have a dick?
Why?
To procreate, to keep the species alive, obviously.
I will. I mean, I don't know.
You are said that you're a sweetheart mauler.
That's not good enough. Come on the stream.
Come on the stream.
I think you need to understand that people already call us evil alt right
Hitler youth, Nazi lovers.
So it doesn't fucking matter.
Well, I mean, I don't know if you, I probably need to put it in a tweet.
I doubt he's watching.
He could feel totally welcome here safe from the, from the evils, you know,
with your safe space with people cut from the same cloth. Damn it.
Do like everyone on YouTube is on your side, man.
Except for everyone.
It's just a fucking crazy people, the crazy regressive is just doing their
thing.
Someone said, ER, get on the stream. You slut.
Yeah, slut.
We are still on the chat, you know, so we can see that he's alive and well.
Jesus Christ.
What if they do this to someone and they kill themselves over it?
Yeah.
I'm not sure how they react to that actually.
Well, that's the thing is like, you know,
it's only a matter of time until they deplatform someone in a ruin their
livelihood and they legit kill themselves because of it.
I mean, after all the shit I had to deal with this year,
I very seriously was like,
I don't even want to fucking do anything ever.
So I don't think ER is going to have that same reaction, but well,
it's only a matter of time till they find the right person.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, the thing is,
it's a bit of a controversial subject. Like how would they react to that?
I don't know.
They get very sensitive whenever anybody does anything,
quote unquote drastic, like leaving Instagram.
They will be very upset.
It'll be like, your abuse has caused this event.
So I wonder if they would apply that to themselves or they justify it by
saying they were an anti-semite or they were.
Well, they'll just say, oh, look, one less Nazi in the world.
Which is a.
Possible. Yeah.
Like I really don't know how they react to it,
considering how strongly a lot of them would fucking do.
Um, I was strongly out with that complaint.
Um.
I'm going to, I'm going to say you can come on the efap chat.
Email may not come, but you know, we've left him.
We are your friend.
Um, anyway.
Powerful family and everyone has been looking to him.
Well, he said it best.
I think what?
I'm going to walk out with a laser sword and face down the hole.
No one asked him to do that.
They just wanted help.
Yep.
To counter with the OT.
What the fuck was Luke doing?
Getting in his X wing and flying against the desktop.
What's he going to do face down the entire empire?
What an idiot.
So the logic just doesn't fly.
It doesn't fly with any part of Luke's character.
It's a part of what's so annoying.
He's just, he's an idiot now.
Both people in universe and out.
We elevated him to mythical status.
They like that thematic connection.
They're like, Luke is just like, he is an hour wheel.
Like if he saved the galaxy,
he would rightfully be placed in a position that with elevation.
Yeah.
What Mark Hamill loves what Luke does to people and how it makes them feel.
He, he gets great satisfaction and joy from knowing that he could change
people and make them feel great.
Yeah.
Major bucket.
A to vote from the OT.
I feel like I could take out the whole empire by myself.
Nevermind that was who's up from.
Was it wasn't big?
Was it somebody in who's the co-pilot in the, uh, the half battle,
I believe from with Luke.
I can't remember the name of the guy, but, uh, yeah, nevermind that.
Oh, true hero.
The story is porkins.
I love him.
He says, so of course he wants nothing to do with this.
Like, of course he wants nothing to do with it.
Who could live up to that?
Who could write him to live up to that?
And the chatter saying it was deck deck.
Okay.
Hey, um, remember that time I had to go to the bathroom.
No, not really.
Yeah.
Nobody pays attention to your bathroom breaks.
Um, read a few super chats while he's gone.
At least figure out where I was.
There was two donations about buying rags and new microphone.
I think he's okay.
He's, um, he's, he's fixed it now.
Somehow.
Oh, there we go.
So a molar.
Have you ever heard of the YouTube channel?
Like stories of old, he does psychological evaluations of movies.
And some of them are really interesting.
Curious for your opinion.
I have not heard of the channel.
I'm afraid.
I've seen a couple of his videos.
They're good.
Yeah.
I mean, I think you would be under the impression.
Be a little longer on some of them, but.
I didn't have any issue with them.
I only saw a couple of them.
I can't remember which ones off the top of my head.
If I looked them up, I could tell you stories of old.
This is the same type of shit that Hello Greedo says.
If the internet was around during the time of the OT,
then it would have gone a lot of hate.
That's why it was, you know,
worldwide popular and made the most money like that a movie could ever
make.
Why is everyone hated.
Then again, I, I suppose I'm a hypocrite.
It's like the last time I made money.
It's like, it sure did.
It sure did.
I can't deny that.
Give this to Rags.
You can buy a new bike as well.
Yeah.
And then they posted the Latin thing.
I think there's a translation later.
You guys are great.
I feel like I owe you for hours of entertainment.
Hopefully we maintain entertaining.
Sometimes I hope I'm concerned that maybe people are falling asleep and,
you know,
we don't want that unless you actually want to fall asleep to this sort of
thing.
You know what?
To each their own.
Wherever there's a rhyme or lyric I appear.
What's up guys.
Once there was a man called McBride,
he fell into an outhouse and died.
His unfortunate brother fell into another.
And now they're interred by side by side.
It's a rhyme.
Don't, I don't know how it's relevant.
You know, it's just weird rhyme out of nowhere.
Yeah.
Like stories of old is posted a lot about movies.
He's made a lot of videos on Lord of the Rings.
I found he made a video on the gray.
He was really short,
but that's where I remembered him from.
I think that was the first video from his.
I saw from him that I saw.
Roses are blue.
So to aligns.
Don't you tell me different.
I'm colorblind.
Respect my opinion on the visible light spectrum.
Oh, let's be honest.
Color is implied.
Color is a construct.
It's Latin for I love y'all wolf and rags animal.
Oh, no love for logics.
Oh, well.
Or a logic.
What?
It always will.
Hey, at least he has his cookies.
That's true.
What?
What?
What?
Did I miss something?
Someone said they gave love to me,
Rags and Wolf.
And I felt.
Oh, felt you had named specifically.
And that was offensive.
I see.
Perhaps you should deplatform the person who provided that
donation.
No logic is implied.
Okay.
Fine.
Star Wars will end with a great reveal that everything that
happens in the movie,
just two kids playing with action figures,
expectations and footage.
That's a possibility.
To escape the problems of the last Jedi.
I'm not saying I would do it,
but I'm not saying I wouldn't do it.
Someone said love for logic is implied.
Midichlor is reduced as canon and prequels a way to measure
the amount of force in somebody that were hated and retconned out
of the series.
I don't know if they were retconned out.
They still exist, right?
Thanks guys for waiting for me.
I think people just stopped ever mentioning them again.
Yeah.
Any way to fix the last Jedi is to have episode nine start with
the last Jedi ending and have someone waking up.
Yeah.
Preferably Luke or Finn from his action.
What a strange dream.
Okay.
Watching this.
I'm really happy that I didn't see cinema sins video.
I like his general.
Oh, so it must be cinema wins video.
I like his general positivity,
but he's straw manning and defending a lot of lore problems
that should be called out.
Like I said, my take on this so far is it's probably the least
combative of all the TLJ videos we've seen.
He's still making a lot of arguments that there are counters
for that.
He's not accounting for that sentence made sense.
Right.
Silence means that it did.
Excellent.
I agree entirely with what you said.
See undeniable appraisal.
It's true.
The only way to fix the last Jedi is to turn out the Jar Jar Binks
is behind everything from the beginning.
I agree.
They didn't take away Luke.
I cannot watch OTL PT because of the last Jedi.
Luke is not the same character when you have one flashback for why.
Yeah, I agree.
I agree.
Yeah.
And someone said, you know,
about being regretful if someone was to take their life
because of the shit people say online.
Tall Biscuit and Stanley got like shredded by certain people
when they died.
So they were they were encouraged to commit suicide.
From my point of view, the Jedi are failures, Luke.
Yeah.
From my point of view, the Jedi are failures.
Great channel.
Well, thank you.
How does Ray talk with such conviction about Luke saving Vader
when she just found out he wasn't a myth two days ago?
Yeah, it's just.
Fuck it.
Why not?
That's that's the attitude there.
Really, Luke's new philosophy in the last Jedi is just Ryan Johnson
trying to make himself look smart.
But when you actually analyze these lines, they make no sense.
Oh, wait, turn your brain off.
I forgot.
Exactly.
Yeah, you need to focus on the themes.
They should have used a different character for this whole hero thing,
preferably somebody who was trained by Luke Skywalker
and didn't live up to being a Jedi as Luke has created this,
you know, idea of what a Jedi is if they wanted to do that story.
You could have made that the story after this trilogy.
This is the trilogy where our heroes complete their stories.
You don't have to kill them all or whatever.
And then, you know, Luke's best student struggles
under the pressure of trying to live up to his master or something.
And that could be a storyline.
But instead, you fucking forced it onto Luke Skywalker,
which was the most inappropriate character.
Theme, theme, theme.
Sorry, but Mark Hamill doesn't get to decide who or what Luke becomes.
As much as I love his honesty,
even his lack of ego for letting Ryan do what he thought was best
and side note, killing it in a role he fundamentally disagreed with
using the fact that Hamill was upset doesn't really mean much to me.
Rip.
I mean, it's not like we define whether or not something's right
or wrong in a film if an actor says it's right or wrong.
But we've always stood by the fact that there is insight into Luke Skywalker
from Mark Hamill, undeniably.
I would imagine nobody knows Luke more than he does.
Even more than Lucas.
He has to... Mark, I don't know if I'd say he's a method actor,
but he's said several times he wants to get into the mind
of the people he's playing.
He wants to know their history, why they do everything,
and then he can play them better.
And apparently this guy isn't the one you trust
to find out what Luke would do, so...
And he's not included the part where Mark actually said
that he kind of regrets what he says.
I'm interested that he hasn't included that, but hey, fair enough.
And I'm not going to say that you misunderstood the original trilogy
if you came away thinking Luke was the optimistic center of the universe.
He was.
We all took our own truths away from those films.
I think we can all agree that Hope has been a main theme throughout Star Wars.
Leia is always talking about...
Well, what do you hate Hope now, Rags?
I do hate Hope. Fuck Hope. Hope is an excuse for doing nothing.
Don't disagree.
It's Luke and the title of episode four.
Leia is always talking about it. Fair enough.
Four, and now Rey and the Resistance are the physical embodiment of it.
The physical embodiment of Hope?
Oh, are they?
By that, does he mean a person who thinks about Hope?
I don't know.
Does he mean physical represent? I don't even...
That was just a weird line. Fair enough. Themes.
I think people were upset by who Luke became because he had lost his Hope.
But like I said in my Return of the Jedi video, even he was deceived in the end.
Some of you disagree with that.
Deceived by... Is he talking about the thing he saw in Kylo's head?
Or was he talking about something else?
We don't know if he was wrong or not.
We don't know if that was a premonition or if it was...
Bullshit created by Snoke? Yeah, we don't know.
Yeah, or bullshit created by Snoke? That's the thing.
Yeah, I'm not sure what I was referring to.
With my interpretation, but to me, Luke had to use the rage of the dark side to beat Darth Vader.
He went up to and may have slightly crossed the line.
The difference being that he turned back.
But in that moment, he learned that the line between light and dark isn't as clear as it seemed.
Yeah, sorry, you can't just extrapolate that scene onto this one and say it totally makes sense. This lines up.
They were completely different situations with completely different nuance.
I can't believe these people just don't get it.
How can you keep making this argument when there's clearly a totally different situation behind it?
He tried to regain his Hope one more time when he took Ben Solo in.
What?
Is he saying that he became disheveled Luke immediately after episode six and then he took Ben in and hopes to undo that?
You ever feel like Ryan doesn't understand characters?
Oh, just a little bit. Just a little bit.
Solo in, and once again chose a dark path for a split second, ironically seeing his robotic hand holding a lightsaber just like with his father.
Uh-huh.
Three.
Only this time it was too late to turn back.
The damage was done.
This time he'd already swung that killing blow as far as Kylo was concerned.
And you really can't blame that on this film.
What do you mean we can't blame that on the film?
It's in the film.
In the film, and the film decided it would be in there.
The film, they chose to have it in there, man.
It's like writing yourself into a quarter. It's like, don't do that.
This film, that's where we were headed after Force Awakens. I felt confident predicting it.
Just like Master Oogway says, one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
Yeah, that's a fucking nonsense. That's fucking nonsense. Bullshit.
One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.
Yeah, sometimes. Sometimes not.
I mean, you're going to reach an ending no matter what.
And then if you just say yes, there's so many ways to interpret that line.
It's one of those like, ooh, it's so wise. It is unhelpful in every way.
It's weird that he's pulling in Kung Fu Panda references and Wreck-It Ralph references, but fair enough.
Often closed on Ben's dark side of legions in that moment.
So at that point-
No, he didn't, because they still were curious as to whether or not he'd be a good guy in the first one and in this film too, after that scene.
Even by the film standards, they disagree with you.
He decided the use of the Force was not a good thing and he cut himself off.
That's why he has no clue what's going on in the galaxy.
The use of the Force was not a good thing. That is not what Luke said. Luke said it doesn't belong to the Jedi.
He cut himself off from the Force and that seemed shameful.
If you remember Rey's reaction, she was like, you cut yourself off of the Force and he looks down like, almost like he's been caught masturbating or something.
And I don't exactly understand why he cut himself off from the Force after he makes the argument that the Force is for everyone.
It doesn't belong to the Jedi.
Was it ever established before this that you could cut yourself off from the Force?
Apparently it was in one of the games, but-
Force unleashed.
Yeah, so it's-
Nailed the cop.
I'm not too bothered by that, but I'd like them to explore it a little bit further than just saying, I did it.
Yeah, like is it a switch that you can turn on and off or what exactly?
Masturbation was implied.
Finn closed on Ben's dark side allegiance in that moment.
So at that point he decided the use of the Force was not a good thing and he cut himself off.
I love that. The use of the Force was not a good thing. It's the course I even mean.
Ben just don't use the Force.
Isn't that like the Force arguably is a tool slash weapon?
So how you use it would be what defines whether or not it was good or bad, not the existence of it within you? I don't know. Whatever.
That's why he has no clue what's going on in the galaxy.
But I understand that's why he has no clue what's going on in the galaxy. Yes, I agree with that conclusion.
Yeah, I see why. How did we get here to this point?
The use of the Force is not a good thing. You know what? Let's go into my video.
What is?
The use of the Force is not a good thing. Just vaguely, generally.
Okay.
He thought the Jedi weren't helping anything, which based on evidence and history, they weren't.
It was a Sith who destroyed the Emperor while the last Jedi was being sizzled for sticking to the light side.
Thanks to a Jedi convincing him to come to the light side. Are we just going to ignore those details?
I know that's an obtuse interpretation, but...
No, he admits that it's not even...
What's the point?
It's also very literal. Hope was no longer a luxury Luke could have.
Why?
Yeah.
What do you even mean?
And I can't blame him for that. He failed his sister, failed his brother-in-law and best friend, and in failing his nephew-
Yeah, all these things happened after you've apparently claimed he lost faith because you said he took in Ben as an attempt to try and regain Hope.
By the way, these failures as a result of the writing, they're not things that Luke had in his repertoire already.
He didn't have to fail. The writers made it so he failed. Not even JJ made it so he failed. This was Ryan.
Yeah, this is pretty fresh. They just made this up. That's why I'm so curious to know what JJ had in mind.
Created the new Darth Vader.
You had created the new Darth Vader. If that's not a reason to sideline yourself, what is?
I agree that he would lose faith in himself if he did all those things. We're saying those things don't match his character.
And we didn't see enough of them anyway. We saw a ten second flashback and a couple of lines of exposition.
But that's just the first two acts of the movie. After a chat with Yoda and the realization that Rey didn't need to-
Did you say the first two acts? Is he gonna count the fact that there's four acts in this film? No wonder.
It's a very jumbled structure.
Could be a Jedi in the sense that he'd accepted Luke found hope again.
Rey didn't need to be a Jedi in the sense that he'd accepted Luke found hope again.
Yeah, one quick chat with Yoda and Luke completely undoes his thirty year distance from episode six.
Thanks for waiting thirty years, Yoda.
What a pathetic character that his entire mindset, a wise, controlled mindset, is altered when Yoda says the best teacher failure is.
Wow.
And whatever.
Watching her ask the dark side for help, as he once did, reminded him he didn't need to be afraid of the Force.
Watching her ask the dark side for help? What are you talking about?
I guess he thinks that in that sequence she was reaching out to the dark side in order to give her something?
Is he talking about when she goes into the hole? Because he's showing this clip, so I'm assuming not.
Well, but I think this is for the next thing he says.
And he literally marches out to face the first order with a lightsaber. Knowing full well he's going to die.
That's not what literally means.
No, it's not well.
Oh, boy. Here we go again.
We don't use this new age bullshit postmodernist cultural Marxist definition of literal. That can mean, oh, no, words, no.
I put my foot down there.
What if you woke up tomorrow and everyone referred to a car as a plane and a plane as a car?
How long would it take you before you adopt the reverse if everyone disagrees with you?
I'm not saying that's the scenario we're in now, but I'm curious.
Because I'd be like, why did you relabel these words? Oh, well, no, exactly.
I would like that be like two, but eventually you'd have to just change because the whole reason we use language is to communicate with other people.
No, I don't have to change the children who are wrong.
Yeah, let's let's wind him back a bit there. It's hard to keep track of all of his.
What's it? What's a non insulting version of nonsense?
Idiotic. No, that's I would say I think you already said the insulting.
I must know. No, no, I didn't say I'm asking.
You didn't say it. You just OK. What was the word that we're looking for?
Synonym of nonsense. This is this will be easy.
I'm pretty sure. Babble, baloney, baloney, baloney.
This foolishness gibberish, joke, madness, rubbish, silliness, stupidity, trash, bulldodash, bananas.
This is not fully more possible. This is claptrap.
Fatuity? What the hell is fatuity?
Flightyness. Fun.
Guys, it's it's it's folly, obviously.
Palava. Oh, I'm calling it. I'm afraid your video is constructed of palava.
Mr. Cinema wheels. Palava. Total baloney.
So this video is fully stop now.
And he literally marches out to face the first order with a boulder dash.
Boulder dash. He literally marches. I was like, I mean, he figuratively does because he's not really there.
He's real enough to cast a shadow and make noise, but not real enough to.
Oh, apparently his name is Lee. That's awkward considering the other Lee.
Oh, it's maybe it's a thing with Lee.
Can't trust those Lees, man. God damn it. He can't trust the Lees.
Knowing full well he's going to die. And by doing something so legendary, he sparks the hope that his physical form never has physical form.
He embodied that legend in a way that no one had before. I can't. What?
What do you mean? He never could have. What?
You see, Luke couldn't have done anything meaningful or impactful like this.
He didn't need to be afraid of the force, and he literally marches out to face the first order.
Never afraid of the force anyway, but with a lightsaber knowing full well he's going to die.
Are you talking about his name was Lee majorly? Oh, no, no, no. The other one.
This guy's name is Lee, apparently. Oh, well, cinema since since just commented saying his name is also Lee retards.
That's where I got the fucking statement from retards.
Oh, well, pay attention. I thought you were talking about this guy, cinema wins.
Yeah, he's called Lee cinema cinema since since is Jay.
But he just said his name was Lee. No, he's talking about cinema wins when he said that. What the fuck?
You can't read his name. Oh, his name is.
Okay, I thought he said my name is Lee.
Okay. Oh, shit. I just insulted you. Please don't ban me. No, we just we read our chat chat.
Don't say that. That's a naughty word, but it is clever. It's naughty, but I like it.
Something so it's the tree. His physical form would never have sparked the hope that he sparks by doing this.
This legendary thing sparks the whole we're not going to we're not going to explain how words of these deeds.
You know how they spread across the galaxy so quickly. You don't know how word got out.
It's so funny to me as well, because let's let's pretend for a second.
We're all in the Star Wars universe. And then they go, if you hear the legend of Luke Skywalker and let's ignore the O.T.
Like, what is the legend? It's like this is a guy who walked out in front of an army of those. Have you seen those first order walkers?
You know, yeah, what do you do? Well, they shot him like they all shot him and he like didn't die and they disappeared.
You know, okay. What does that mean? Why is that inspiring? He's like, well, he didn't die. He faced them.
Like, who was he? Why? He's trying to show that they're not so powerful. So where's this guy now? He's dead.
Why is this an inspiring story?
Anyone? I got nothing.
Well, a lot of this goes into world building, like how much to the first order control, you know, galactic image and propaganda and how much to the control communications and how much.
I mean, because the idea that some ragtag bunch of survivors hops off a ship, a ship and like, yeah, Luke Skywalker, he appeared as a magical apparition and he fought off the first order.
But he was really just a ghost and then he disappeared and then he saved us all. And I wonder how convincing that would be to people.
Like I said, I'd just be confused asking people what the hell happened. I'd be like, I don't.
What are you trying to tell me? And it's like a ghost went and attacked the first order. Is that what you're saying to me right now? Well, yeah.
Someone said there is literally no rhino, Lee Baggins.
Spectral rhinos are still rhinos. Not all spectral rhinos.
Hope that his physical form never could have done. He embodied that legend in a way that no one had before. I can't help but love that so much.
I really feel like anyone who says Luke should have actually shown up wasn't paying attention.
You're supposed to not be combative. Wow. Sorry. Don't do that. It's mean.
Okie dokie. He had a way bigger impact as the legend than a physical being. Motherfucker, he was a legend before and he had a physical being.
He already admitted that. He already did this shit. Why?
Non-combatively. Why? How long did you write this for? Because it's bad. A year. Oh, God.
Why? It's so bad. Why would you contradict yourself like this? You could be could be as much of a legend if you had a real body. I mean, that's why I understood that if you were actually paying attention.
You wouldn't have been able to do anything if he was really there. The same results would have happened.
You get shot and murdered or you get shot and holds the lasers in place and fires them back or just dissipates them and then Kylo comes down and fights him and Kylo kills him.
The scene is exactly the same. Instead, he was a ghost or or he just doesn't like he surely there could have been other things he could have done instead of just walking out there.
It's like, hey, bitches, I'm Luke Skywalker. No, surely there are other things he could have done during all of that time, like the buildup of the empire and all this stuff.
And maybe what if he what if he showed up and he lifted the rocks? Yeah, that actually would have been cool.
I mean, Jesus, that would have been so cool if it was him. If Luke was doing it, you know, like, yeah, I'm fucking like Skywalker lifted up fucking mountain.
That's the third solution because the three solutions I've always had to the fucking stupid hick moving the rocks is one, make it so that she's basically in anguish doing it and potentially bleeding from the nose.
Basically, she has to try her best to have it done. And you can have Finn being like, Ray, help on the other side.
So it's a bit emotional and she actually isn't just super powered, but no, just have him move them casually and half falling asleep while doing it to have her and Leia do it together just because I mean, we've gone so far with force at this point.
You may as well or three. Yeah, have Luke do it. Fuck it. Have Luke do it. I mean, he's got the he's got the X wing.
They could be like he fixed it because he's so fucking he's fucking Luke Skywalker.
I love this, though. He's just like you guys would pay attention. He wouldn't be able to do anything if he was really there.
It's like you say so. Luke could have moved the rocks and they could have escaped.
Oh, sorry. That only took a second, didn't it?
It only took a second for us to think of a counter to what he said. He's like, that must be embarrassing.
Hey, it took him a year to write this. How dare you? Oh, maybe you should have took him two years. That's true. Anything if he was really there.
I guess the other option was Superman, Luke. I just can't. Yeah, we've gone over this before.
But for some reason, everybody assumes that if you don't like what they did, then you expected him to literally fly around and stab everyone with a lightsaber and start shouting Yahoo and stuff.
And I'm amazing and deflect everything. It's just like, why does he have to be that? Why is there no in between with you people?
Why is that what we want? Almost seems like you're using opposition and exaggerating it to make us look more unreasonable.
Do they have a word for that in argumentation? I can't remember.
I don't think so. They should. Someone should. Yeah, I like I like that they could because it's it seems to happen a lot.
See a way in which Luke showing up and tearing Gorilla Walkers apart with his mind works.
Why would that be the only thing that he would have had to do? No, nothing else can happen.
Yeah, it's like that's the only thing that could have happened. He would have had to go out there and destroyed every single one, even though they don't do that in the movie as it is.
So I don't even know why he would think that because that's not what happens in this version. They call it lying.
They call it lying.
Once you make him Super Jedi, where do you go from there?
Don't rewrite the movie with someone else's suggestion and then dishonestly try and conclude from it when you don't even have them there to talk about it.
Don't bother. That's never what Star Wars has been about. As if you understand what Star Wars has been about.
Don't get me wrong. Vader's complete ponage in that hallway is thrilling and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
But that was less than what I've seen people expecting of Luke. Luke was never supposed to get God mode. He's always been a conflicted kid.
No, he's not always been a kid. And not everyone is saying he should have God mode. That's ridiculous.
Yeah, this guy looks like a kid to me.
What, Kylo?
No, Luke.
Oh, right.
Old, sad, miserable, the verge of death, Luke.
He's always been a conflicted kid. God.
In the end, Luke gave up everything to embrace his legend status in a wholly unique way. But enough about Luke.
Stop winning, countering shit. It makes me taste hard to take you seriously.
Not even really one of the main characters, but I felt like I needed to explain why I liked his portrayal in this film.
You did a poor job, but I'll accept that you're welcome to like it.
My mind has not been convinced.
Oh, no.
The reasons are terrible.
Oh, no.
One of the main themes.
No.
That's the thing.
You can have so many themes.
The theme of hope, the theme of failure, the theme of sauerkraut.
I don't fucking matter.
You can have a theme for anything you want and you can mash it and scramble it up in any way you want.
And somehow it'll still magically all come together.
It's some subtle symbolic way.
Logic.
What?
I thought you were dead.
Thank God.
What?
How come?
How come you're next to me now in Wolf and Mauler on that side?
Look, I was getting a little lonely and you were giving me the attention I need.
So I was focusing on the video.
Wolf.
Wolf.
It's important.
Hey, I'm important, too.
I'm here tonight, but this has there are people watching this.
I know for them.
I don't owe them anything.
This film is failure.
Almost every plan put in place has at least a piece that fails.
As if you can't apply that to basically like every film that ever has plans in it.
As if everything goes perfectly all the time.
Poe destroys the dreadnought, but every bomber is destroyed.
How else how could that seat have ended any other way?
Yeah, it's a big.
Yeah, it's a big fucking loss.
Oh, no, we don't have our useless ass bombers.
Oh, no.
Yeah, I consider it a weird exchange.
Yeah.
Three bombers.
Or was there how many?
Five.
I want to say five.
A bunch of fucking five.
Five obviously shit bombers.
Thinking about it.
They blow up here.
You'd think the explosions would be massive, right?
Yeah.
Because of the bombs and it would just blow the shit out of everything in the fleet because
the explosion is enough to take out the dreadnought for Christ's sake, like.
Hmm.
I didn't even think of that.
There's this sort of thing.
Wolf's been saying it for a long time, but whenever you take a critical eye to the last
Jedi, it never ends.
You just keep watching it or looking over things and you're like, oh, there's another
thing.
Oh, there's another thing.
Five and a half hours is nowhere near enough to cover the last Jedi's issues.
Just goes on and on.
Rose and Finn find a code breaker, but he ends up selling the resistance out because they
were caught.
He never intended to do that from the beginning.
He was actually helping them.
But sure.
Holdo sends the transports to the planet, but a lot of them are destroyed and she has to
get a get a hurry down because she fucking does a retarded play.
You know, I don't disagree.
A lot of the characters make stupid decisions.
You're right.
Die to save them.
But through failure, each character grows and changes.
How does Holdo grow and change from her failure?
Dies.
How does Finn grow and change from her failure?
How does Paige Tico grow from her failure?
How does Finn grow and change from his failure?
Well, in fairness, Paige Tico grew into about a thousand different pieces.
And she's currently floating around in space somewhere.
I don't think of that so much as multiplication as I do division.
That's true.
That's true.
Asians are good at math, so it's very important that you get those two right.
Yeah, Wolf.
I'm sorry.
Dick.
Okay.
Well, in fairness, Rose grew outward.
Okay.
Initially, Ray came to convince Luke to come back.
Essentially embraces the dark side.
Essentially embraces the dark side.
What?
What are you talking about, Lee?
I am legitimately curious what he means by that.
Touching a wall is embracing the dark side.
It's a dark wall.
What are you talking about?
To get no answers and then falls into Snoke's trap to then be betrayed by Kylo one last time.
She looked overpassed in The Force Awakens.
Kylo, she was hoping he would turn.
He still kills Snoke, which is undeniably a pro in the pro-con column.
That's good.
Yeah.
So as much as he didn't turn to the good side, he got rid of Snoke, so that's a high five.
I'm sure she's at least happy with that.
But it's dumb anyway, the fact that she wants him to turn when she's supposed to be extremely angry at him for what he did to Han Solo, but apparently that got forgotten over a scene.
The thing holding her back, this ever-present who am I and where do I come from?
Which brings me to one of the most hated versions.
You have no place in this story.
You come from nothing.
You're nothing.
I don't see the you're nothing message as some inclusionist propaganda.
What?
Inclusionist propaganda.
Inclusionist propaganda?
No, I've never heard it called that.
I've never heard that argument.
I've never ever heard that called inclusionist propaganda.
I have no idea where he's pulling things from.
What does that mean exactly?
Like they're trying to promote that everybody's OK?
Yeah, I guess they're trying to say that this this film is so inclusive that you can be special even if you don't come from any place special.
Anyway, I'll just kick on because I.
So that's why when the first Star Wars was released, Luke was the son of a long dead Jedi who some old guy spoke highly of far as he knew.
I do.
OK, his parents were nobodies and soon even his adoptive aunt and uncle were dead.
Luke was a nobody.
Sure, he ended up being the son of the most powerful Jedi and Sith ever.
But that's not where we started.
Star Wars became a story of important bloodlines, but that's not what made us relate to Luke.
He was just a moisture farmer who wanted to join the rebellion.
I don't disagree.
What's your point?
I'm glad Ray is no one because now we've circled back around to anyone can make a difference.
The world has been open.
Oh, the fucking wind counter.
The problem isn't that anyone can become a well trained Jedi.
Notice how I said well trained.
Anyone.
I mean, not just like incredibly pretentious that he gives himself wins.
Yeah, I was about to say he's like sucking your dick and rolls away like that's true.
I'm right on that.
I mean, geez, I get people to suck my dick for me.
Christ.
Yeah, we'll get around to that later tonight.
Yeah, boy.
But the message here is like Ratatouille is like not everyone can become a famous chef, but a famous chef can come from anywhere.
Yes.
The exact same thing as becoming a much better film than the last.
We don't like we don't like seeing someone who's powerful without having earned it.
If you embrace the quick route to become powerful, you become a dark side user.
You have low morals.
You're you're detested by a majority of people while someone who works hard and fights for what they love and everything,
which can lead to the dark side, by the way.
But, you know, it's very simple.
Like we don't as an audience want to see somebody who becomes extremely powerful and altruistic godlike without having to do shit.
OK, it's not about her surname mattering.
I don't I don't even know how many people are making this argument, to be honest.
I'm not saying no one is, but how many people are saying Ray should have been a Skywalker just because that would be cool.
Yeah, I mean, I kind of and it kind of makes the scope of the universe seem smaller, too.
Everyone's just fucking related to this one thing.
That's the thing. I'm I'm in favor of not making her a Skywalker or Kenobi, but you make her a nobody and it gets a little bit confusing.
Tell me why she is so incredible at everything without trying.
Back up. How can you hate that message? I feel a lot of the main issues people had with the movie.
Wait, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what the message is. It's if the message is portrayed well in the film.
Well, he's like, how can you hate that message, the message that anyone can make a difference?
What who who in the world hates that message?
Yeah, you can have a message that's good.
But if it's not portrayed well in the film, then people will have an issue with its portrayal.
It's a little bit of a straw man.
If you ask me to make a difference, the world has been opened back up.
How can you hate that message? I feel a lot of the main issues hasn't been opened back up.
It just took us to me in a way like, sure, it has in a way. But at the same time, it's almost like you're throwing darts at a dartboard.
It has this element of just randomness to it where your success or failure.
Here's the thing with Ray. If she doesn't work for it, if it's just who she is, then what hope do we have?
It doesn't matter if we train or not.
We'll never be as good as that because it's just given to us and taken away from us arbitrarily by some unseen force, for lack of a better term.
But if we see her like I could believe that I could be a Luke because you see Luke suffer and you see him overcome his obstacles and you see him grow and change and develop and he works hard along the way.
But how do you see yourself as Ray?
Yeah, I don't know how anybody empathizes with Ray ever. It's like, what were you, were you born perfect?
Someone in chat says the force awakens introduce her parents as a plot point.
I mean, it introduced them as something she was going to be searching for, but Maz Kanata did say they don't fucking matter, move on.
Yeah, and then she's like, OK, and and they could have done something with that. Like, this is why you want to be part of the rebellion.
There are cause you care about, which then this is something that you can latch on to.
Which comes into the other problem of her motivation.
But we even with Maz saying that we don't have an explanation for Ray's power. That's the the other problem.
So it's just so goddamn confusing movie.
But let's just knock a few out quick. I feel I need to offer rebuttals to the rest of them.
Not because my interpretation is the only correct one, but maybe to give those on the fence that feel swayed by the long list of issues, some different options.
No, no, no. But you said earlier that you don't believe you're not arrogant enough to think that you can change people's opinions.
You're not going to let him be a hypocrite rags, really.
Look, no, I'm better than that. I'm not going to let you be a hypocrite on my watch.
OK, rags is growling.
I don't know. I'm not. I'm really not. I'm smiling. No sadness.
Smiling with sadness. I'm smiling as a head and his all around me are familiar.
Well, hey, he he's hoping to change some people's minds while also not being arrogant or foolish enough to try and change people's minds.
This makes sense. He doesn't think that he can.
He rewrote this over a year and he didn't pick that one up. That's fine.
Listen, the thing is that video nine thousand words, man.
The theme of this video is hope because he hopes that he can change someone's mind, even though he's not arrogant enough to think that he can do that.
But he hopes that he can.
Good. You know, he thinks he can't.
And that mixes in with the theme of failure because he's going to he's been failing to changing my mind this whole video.
Apparently he did this with the prequels, so it's all fair game.
You know, he does it with every one of them. It's all it's all.
OK, OK. The same thing I did with the prequels spoiler alert.
You're not dumb if these things didn't bother you because a lot of them are nothing.
I don't think whether a plot point bothers you is about your intelligence.
I'm not sure. I don't know.
Yeah, it could just be perception.
Then again, I don't know if Wolf wants to weigh in on that.
Uh, not entirely, because you can accept a problem in that, you know, not think it has too much bearing.
Like Episode three, for example, there's a ton of issues, but I can ignore a good amount of them because I was like, it's it's not that horrible of a movie.
OK, when you like deny it.
It's like singing to himself.
Yes, it's his mating ritual.
He does this every night.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
They make different noises from my mating ritual.
Well, well, yeah, but, you know, I don't.
Yeah, the idea of saying like the X doesn't bother me.
It's just like, all right, then.
Can anyone hear me?
Hello, logic. Yes, you do.
I'm duct taped to a chair in Rex's basement.
Can someone help me?
I don't have a basement, but I'm based.
Grown. Oh, hey, today.
Why, why, why, why, why?
Interstellar space.
What? What?
Voyager two has entered the space between solar systems today.
Oh, yeah, I've never met.
I want to.
So it launched in nineteen seventy seven.
Where is it going?
I'm guessing next one, Proxima Centauri or something or Alpha Centauri, whatever the hell it's called.
I have the nearest one, I think.
Remember, it's just going away.
It's not going to hit anything.
Remember how you just reminded me when there was some kind of argument that got brought up about Infinity War,
about how far they've traveled.
And we said, I remember saying to you, Wolf, just some statement about how they were outside.
They were fucking far away.
And then you were like, they're not far away.
They're on Saturn's moon or whatever, Titan.
Yeah, because they named the planet the same thing that a moon is already.
I get it.
But it's just funny.
It's like you really think Thanos is creepy.
Thanos entire species went back close to Earth.
Well, I don't know.
You don't name a planet the same thing as a moon that's like right next to us.
Feel like you would have crushed our planet.
Yes.
Titan's first moon, Titan.
Of the Titan system.
Anyway.
Don't matter.
We already talked about why Holdo didn't O-Po an explanation.
Just like in real life.
You haven't explained.
OK.
Ask anyone in any branch of the military how O-Po would have been treated for questioning a vice admiral the way he does.
This is well after she's let her entire crew think there's no hope.
So you can ask any military personnel how a mutiny works.
It's an actual thing.
So yeah, just because you're a vice admiral doesn't mean that you're a dictator and you can do whatever you want.
Exactly.
Genuinely, I got a sigh of relief when he committed to the mutiny in the film.
I was like, oh, thank Christ.
He's actually doing something.
They won't all die now.
I know they all died anyway.
I would have supported him in real life.
I would have been like, fucking help her.
We need to knock this.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's fucking not die.
I would have suggested the mutiny.
Yeah.
Let's let's do the not dying thing.
Fuck.
Yeah.
There's like one guy on the team who's like, we should kill them too.
He's like, we need to kill them.
We should kill them.
Like, oh, I guess I guess we could.
Like, oh, I get a level with you.
This purple hair bitch.
What the hell, man?
I didn't fucking vote for.
Hold out.
You you have purple hair.
You wear a halo and you have a bowl gown.
And your neck is just absurdly long.
It's wrong.
You shouldn't.
I get why it's annoying because it feels so convenient.
Look at it.
He describes it as realistically.
No, he's saying it's realistic.
Sorry.
Convenient doesn't mean it's not realistic.
Convenience.
The plot.
That's interesting.
You'd say it's inconvenient to the plot.
Or inconvenient to Poe.
I don't know.
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't make any sense.
The exclusive and goodness.
You have to squint to turn this into an anti-patriarchy.
No, I don't think you have to squint.
The fact there's it's undeniable that people associate purple hair with
Tumblr and stuff like that.
That's that's that's definitely part of society right now.
I'm not saying that the Last Jedi is definitively anti-patriarchy.
But why would you have a purple haired character?
That's very like, hmm.
And why would her second in command be a Jew with like the extreme stereotype
nose?
I don't know if she's actually Jewish.
I don't know if she I don't know.
Hey, man, I'm just saying curly hair, big nose.
I don't know what that has to do with being Jewish.
And I don't know if they does Judaism exist in the Star Wars.
Probably not.
Because it was a long time ago.
And that and the Torah was written a long time ago.
But people did definitely say it was anti-patriarchy.
So what I'm trying to say is.
Well, he said you have to squint, I guess.
I haven't heard that it's anti-patriarchy.
Anti-men.
Anti-men.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've heard that too.
Holdo could have been a talking porg and the story would have played out the same.
No, it wouldn't have.
What even?
People would have obviously questioned the leadership of the porg.
Who wouldn't have played out the same if it was a porg?
People would have been like, who are you?
Or whatever the fuck.
Vice Admiral Porglow is taking over.
Porglow.
You know, it's funny.
This is Vice Admiral Porglow.
Before this movie came out, everyone was telling me that the porgs were like vicious little monsters.
But all they do is like sob when Chewbacca eats one of them.
I'd love it if they were like attacking.
You'd think that they would be running away, you know?
Like they'd be trying to get away from Chewbacca.
I would hire a porg over Holdo.
Yes, I do agree with that, though.
Yeah, they probably you can probably pay him like seventy seven cents for.
Well, you'd be paying him more for a human dollar if he was a he pulled rather than a she pulled.
That's true.
I predicted in episode nine, the porg are going to be is it porg or porg?
The porg is like the bull.
There is a porg, but they have a group of multiple, a group of multiple porgs.
OK, in episode nine, the porgs are going to be basically like the Ewoks.
They're going to be armed and and they're going to be pissed because Chewie ate one of them.
Yeah, the entire big arc between them.
Chewie gets eaten alive by them at the end.
It's really hard.
I don't want the porg Chewie arc, but maybe I don't know who knows.
And it's going to be a message about hope and failure.
And they form together and they stick together and they create one super porg.
This is super cool.
If in the trailer for episode nine, we have an army of porgs and Ewoks fighting against armies of Wookiees, we'll just be like, yeah, that seems reasonable.
I'm like, sure.
I'm sure the porn will be great whenever you have to.
Oh, God.
An anti-patriarchy message.
Holdo could have been a talking porg and the story would have played out the same.
Another big issue people have is that the canto bite side quest would have been a little bit more time, but actually makes things worse.
Yeah, it's standby.
It is absolutely a waste of time.
Makes things worse.
Depends what you mean by things.
I mean, every element of this movie makes the film worse.
Sure. But if you're saying like it makes whatever's going on in the film.
Well, yeah, I guess it does because they accidentally reveal.
Look at that fucking weird dog thing that's hovering by its bubble.
But on the right.
Oh, wow.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Whoa.
Wow. Yeah.
Like go back to say I never I never go to here.
I'm going to go to 20.
I have never seen that.
Oh, that's fantastic.
First. That's the point.
That's what this.
That's a beautiful creature.
That fucking that weird ass alien floating by a gas sack on its ass.
Asshole.
Well, whatever floats your boat, I suppose.
Another big issue people have is that they know my boat flies not only is a waste of time, but actually makes things worse.
First. That's the point.
That's what this is.
Wait, did he just say it's supposed to waste time?
Or is he referring to the side instead of like developing backstories or characters or relationships?
He said not only a waste of time, but makes another big issue people have is that the canto bite side quest not only is a waste of time, but actually makes things worse.
First.
That's the point.
Okay.
If the point of canto bite was to make the film worse, then I succeeded with flying colors, man.
Yeah. But I thought the theme of the film was failure.
So I'm not exactly sure.
God damn that weird fucking floating thing is so fucking look at like if that thing just like hovered around.
That would be so creepy.
I would be terrified.
I would shoot it.
I would fucking pull out.
It's it's ass sack and watch it fall to the ground.
Do you think it just stares at you with those blank soulless eyes?
Usually like no, I feel like it might make.
I would much rather that sounds I'd much rather the Turkish guy next to it came up to me instead of it.
Like it floats up behind you or you just on your computer.
It just slowly runs its hand on your face.
Oh, my God. And you can hear it farting to fill the bag back up.
It's like those horrible aliens in dead space where you have to go into like the.
I don't remember what this part of the ship is, but they make the air toxic and you got to stomp them to kill them.
Oh, right. Yeah.
I can't remember the name, though.
Yeah, you don't have to stomp them.
You can shoot them.
Well, well, yeah, but it's more.
It's better to.
Yeah, it's better to just stomp it.
They don't fight back anyway.
It speaks cursive.
Thank you, Ryan, for creating the creepiest alien.
That's the point. That's what this middle chapter is supposed to do.
Plus, it was a learning moment for Pope.
I believe he's standing by that.
It's like it's a waste of time.
That's the point.
It's supposed to do.
Oh, that's.
That's a win.
It was a it was a learning moment for Poe trusting leadership, which, yeah, you can say it so vaguely.
But we've been over how that doesn't make any sense.
No, no, no, it wasn't pretending to be retarded.
It was actually retarded.
Someone said someone said the alien was one of the gas bags from Eden Prime and Mass Effect.
I'm not with the very first mission.
You haven't played Mass Effect.
No.
Oh, my goodness.
Sorry.
Stop at three.
What's wrong with you?
Well, with the gas bags.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The little bitty.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, they didn't actually fight you.
And you only saw him for 30 seconds before you started fighting the gas.
But you popped them.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
They just kind of floated around for about 10 seconds until you found the first or no.
When your first teammate dies and then you tell Kayden, like suck it up.
We're leaving.
Imagine popping that weird blue alien butt thing.
It just like slow, really slowly depreciates.
It's just like moving around.
You're like, oh, don't touch me.
You have a doctor to patch up my gas bag.
I hear quite a lot right now.
You got a bandage.
Oh, no.
A little poop.
Maybe this is this is what he's all about.
It's about family.
Trusting leadership and Finn for realizing that there's more going on in the galaxy than just where's Ray.
There's more going on in the galaxy than just where's Ray.
That is arc learning that Ray isn't the center of the universe.
Like he already knew before he met Ray.
Braspinous straws there, Lee.
And not to mention that Finn learns.
If you remember the scene, he's like, hey, man, you stole the ship.
But at least you stole it from the bad guys and you're helping the good guys.
And then the guy is like, there are no bad guys or good guys.
Idiot.
And then he's like, hmm.
I'm from there.
He becomes super invested in the good guys.
Like, oh, it seems like the opposite should have happened.
But OK.
What a compelling argument.
There are no good and bad.
That's on the spectrum.
Well, good. It is for me.
I agree with you. It doesn't matter.
So I'll be good.
But more importantly, what annoys me is how some seem to completely ignore it.
Essentially the same thing happening in Empire.
Oh, God, we're doing it again. So many people do this.
Oh, no.
It's called whataboutism.
When you say this thing isn't another thing, therefore this thing isn't bad.
But for one, context.
Two, not an argument.
So let's see what the context for this is.
3PO go on their own, save the world mission and get betrayed and captured,
creating a situation where Luke has to abandon his training and then loses a hand.
Bad plans failing badly has always been a huge part of Star Wars.
Do we need to say anything about this?
I will say that shot of Yoda just reminded me of how much better he is in the O.T.
as compared to his cameo in The Last Jedi.
Yeah, I don't know what they did in the new ones, but his O.T. puppet,
for some reason, just can't be replicated, apparently.
What they did with the original O.T.
Yeah.
Did you guys realize, by the way, I thought it was really cool.
The Last Jedi is essentially the exact same film as Indiana Jones.
It has characters.
They travel to different places.
Towards the end, the bad guys are kind of killed or hurt,
and the good guys have taken some injuries along the way.
And you do see a couple of shots of different areas and people talk.
There's a couple of others.
People wear clothes.
That's another one.
Oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah.
There's sand.
Maybe.
Is there any sand?
Yeah, there's sand in one of the Indiana... A couple of Indiana Jones.
There's a beach on counterbikes.
Yeah, and just like Indiana Jones, it ripped out my heart.
There is...
If you see Snoke has, like, eyebrows, but they...
He's got eyebrows.
Someone has eyebrows in Indiana Jones.
I can't think of the character, but they do.
At least he doesn't have a unibrow like Quinton.
Hey, he's combing that thing.
He's grooming it out.
He's getting it out.
He's grooming his unibrow.
I genuinely loved when Kylo followed through with ending him.
That was a great twist.
Oh, yeah, it was a great twist that the Sith apprentice kills the Sith Lord.
Yeah, nobody ever saw that coming.
Again, he's just ignoring the actual argument.
And I say actual very, very intentionally.
It's not that Snoke died.
It's that we don't shit all about Snoke.
He says this as though the movies, the entire point of the Darth Bane books,
or The Force Unleashed, I think Kotor might have mentioned it.
The whole point is that the Sith kill each other all the time.
How is that subverting expectations in a way?
Isn't that in the prequels?
Yoda's like always two, a master and apprentice.
Well, yeah, but I don't think that talks about how they kill each other.
I suppose, yeah.
I know that in the Darth Bane books and in the Force Unleashed.
You got a little bit with how Palpatine wants him to kill Dooku.
Dooku.
That's true.
And Dooku also was like, we can destroy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And technically Vader does it in the O.T.
If we could destroy the Emperor in the galaxy.
How is Kylo killing Snoke even a twist?
Like it's just an unexpected occurrence.
But a twist is something that like recontextualizes the previous occurrences in the film, right?
I think the issue here is the point is like,
Oh, that, that.
I think he thinks the scene is telling us that he's going to kill Rey.
But again, I have to agree with with Mike from Red Letter Media.
He said that when he was watching the scene, he thought it was implying that Kylo was going to kill Snoke.
The twist would be that he kills Rey.
But I was like relatively on board with that, too, because I was like, oh, he's telling that he's going to kill Snoke.
He's going to kill Snoke.
He's like, oh, he he killed Snoke.
Right.
No, E.R.'s Legend of Horror Part Four got taken down.
Oh, that's two down already, and it's not even been a day.
It's not even been like two hours.
Well, it might have been two hours.
But did he did he do it or was it someone else who did it?
I doubt he'd have done it.
Those videos have been up for years.
Yeah, the other one was up for years.
I remember the Legend of Horror Part Four.
You got re-uploaded before, but then he managed to get it back on YouTube.
Is it being like, would you get this info from?
Just curious.
I just saw it in the chat and hold on.
I'm looking it up.
Yeah, it's down.
It's down.
Which part?
Part two.
No, no, wait.
Part four.
It looks like it might have been the re-upload that is still up.
Part three is Legend of Horror.
I can still see Part Four.
They're all up.
Yeah, they're all up.
One through four are up.
Chat lied then.
Well, because what happened, unless they're talking about what he called
the one about...
Green Niggings.
I forgot what his name is.
Yeah, whatever.
The one that isn't about Korra, but is still cool.
Yeah, it's still technically Korra.
It's like the second season.
I think that's one that he had to re-upload.
Because I can only see part three of that one.
It looks like the re-upload is still up.
On VidMe.
Is it?
Yeah, because the description says good news Viacom.
It's a great bag of dicks.
But again, like, sorry, just to make some clarity.
He had part one, part two, part three, part four.
Part four got knocked down for copyright and he re-uploaded it on VidMe.
And then he got it through copyright and part four ended up on YouTube as well.
But now I can't see it on YouTube.
I can see it.
I just went through them all.
Part four is the re-niggings one.
Yes.
Oh.
Yeah, I just saw that.
I don't know about that.
Are you sure?
Because part four this up right now is one minute long and it directs you to the re-upload.
Really?
Hold on.
Because I just looked up, let me find it again.
There's a playlist.
And yeah, it says 42 minutes, 12 seconds.
Oh, okay.
Well, if that video is still up, then yes, fine.
I can't see it on his channel though.
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe it was on a different.
I mean, this playlist isn't by ER, it's by somebody else.
I was going to say if it's real, look, either way, he'll tweet about it if it's actually happened.
So we'll get info on that.
I'll leave his, I've got a second monitor.
I'll just leave his Twitter up so I can see if he tweets out about it while we're doing this.
To make sure.
When I clicked on it, it started playing.
So I don't know.
Was it?
Well, it doesn't matter.
Like I said, we'll find out the truth.
But I'm concerned that if he gets the triple strike and his channel goes and then he's got one.
Oh, man.
Just leave ER alone, guys.
Really?
He can't make jokes?
Is that where we're at?
We're going to destroy people's channels because they made a joke you don't like.
We've been at that for years.
Yeah, I was going to say.
Well, I mean, I know it's been going on for years.
Pisses me off.
Yeah.
It seems like it's gotten way worse recently, though.
It does.
It kind of does.
It's like the normal people seem more and more against it.
But it's the people.
It's like all the strings that just seem more and more for it.
The division is getting way more obvious.
You know, I always I always considered myself to the left of politics.
But like it seems like every year it's like I'm just being shoved far right from the way that people are acting.
And it's like the lines being moved, isn't it?
We're let's say the first left and the first right.
The line keeps getting pushed further to the right as if no to the left.
Sorry. So anything for the left of X is right.
No.
But yeah, it's like, OK, it's like just it's like, OK, if you support Stalin and think he's a great guy, you're left.
If you don't, then you're all right.
Yeah, not even right. All right.
But anyway, as weird as the segue that is back on with Star Wars, a huge part of Star Wars.
The other big subversion was Snoke.
I genuinely loved when Kylo followed through with ending him.
That was a great twist.
And I'm really thankful he's out of the way.
Although there are still ways not much of a twist is to use him.
And if JJ is clever enough, he could still make him important.
But he needs to sort out Kylo first dead.
He's fucking dead.
Swap Kylo with TLJ.
You just saw TLJ first.
OK, once he does that, we'll be fine.
But without Kylo claiming his throne, I'd already seen this dynamic play out.
I want something different.
And I'm sorry.
Just because we live in the age of Internet theorizing doesn't make the fact that characters backstories aren't explored the filmmakers problem.
Who else's problem would it be?
When Jedi ended and the Emperor was dead, how much did you know about him?
The Emperor and Snoke are different characters.
Did it really matter or was he just a foil?
He was the leader of the Empire.
Snoke is the leader of the First Order that rose from the ashes of the Empire.
We need to know how that was possible and where he came from.
How many times do we have to explain this?
Not the same thing.
I'm not saying this film doesn't have problems without perfect solutions.
It's hard to explain why we've never seen anyone hyperspace ram another ship before, even if there has to be a first time for everything.
Though, like off the top of my head...
That's ridiculous to think that no one in the thousands and thousands of years...
You get to slip that in.
He knows full well.
That's a terrible argument.
You know full fucking well that there is no fucking way that this loon was the first person to ever think,
Can you guys name a tool that someone has not definitively used as a weapon?
A straw?
No, no, no, because people use straw, man.
Let's see, you've got a plushie.
Let me change my question to a tool that cannot be used as a weapon, maybe.
This will feed into a point, but can that be answered?
It's like the point is that people will try to militarize everything and find out how they can gain a strategic advantage.
Bomb?
Bomb is a tool that's never been used as a weapon.
Bomb?
What about bullets?
We haven't used Jared as a weapon yet.
The only thing I'm going to say is that you seriously underestimate humanity when you question whether or not they would have tried to weaponize something like hyperspace.
What do you mean? It ain't just humanity.
What is it?
Well, every other species in the galaxy.
This is about some alien species that just appears humanish.
Oh no, it's not just humanity, it's every other species in the galaxy.
The idea that they go, well the main difference in Star Wars between Earth humanity and stuff like that is that most species, most life doesn't like to weaponize things.
That's the major difference.
Like, oh, also Birex.
Also Hirex.
Hello. What's up? What's going on here?
What are you guys doing?
Star Wars galaxy humans haven't yet developed tools. They just sort of found a few things lying around and they just sort of fly around.
Again, with the...
Ignore the fact that it's called Star Wars.
The possible exposition dump we could get in the next episode.
They just go, man, I can't believe Holdo did that.
Has no one ever tried that before?
And then someone goes, no one has ever tried that before.
Wow. That's amazing that no one's ever tried that before.
Yeah, no one's tried that before.
And then look at the camera.
Yeah, no one would have ever imagined.
The Force must have been suppressing their will to try that until the right time.
So you're saying it's canon that no one's tried that before? Like, we're being too overt with this.
They could develop some kind of shield that's based off a hyperspace engine that creates a wormhole that will just make a light speed ship pass right by you.
Light speed weapons aren't the end all.
What?
Did you just suggest that to counter light speed Kamikaze's in future, we can now develop shields that create a light space wormhole that prevent people from being able to Kamikaze into you?
How about we just never do this again?
Do you know what?
I was supposed to address how nobody had done it before, though.
I think that was a... he used that as just like a side argument.
Go back just a little bit, like, because he said just off the top of my head, like, just go back to...
I'm sorry, just because we live in the age of internet theorizing doesn't make the fact that characters' backstories aren't explored the filmmakers problem.
When Jedi ended and the Emperor was dead, how much did you know about him? Did it really matter or was he just a foil?
I'm not saying this film doesn't have problems without perfect solutions.
It's hard to explain why we've never seen anyone hyperspace ram another ship before, even if there has to be a first time.
Yeah, it's pretty fucking hard to explain that.
See? Go off the top of my head. They could develop some kind of shield.
As an explanation for why nobody's done it before.
Yeah, he's put, though, which implies it's a continuation of the previous thing he just said, which is the other thing.
I don't think... I'm not sure he meant for that to happen, but yeah, with the way he just delivered that.
And you can't pull off the top of my head thing after saying you wrote this over a year?
Hello, Prax.
They could develop a shield that makes it so that when you hyperspace through, they get walked through you.
And as some people have already mentioned in chat...
Spat out the other side.
It's like creating bullets that go through seven million inches of steel.
I'm honestly not seeing how else you're interpreting it, though, than what I said.
It's hard to explain how nobody's ever come up with the idea to do this before, though off the top of my head, they could develop some kind of shield.
Well, if we go back...
To prevent this thing that hasn't been done before, that no one's ever thought of?
It's...
If they are coming up with a defense for it, they are obviously thinking of it being used as a weapon.
In terms of structure, I think he's got point and then addition and then counter to point.
It's hard to explain why we've never seen this before, I suppose, around another ship before.
Point.
Even if there has to be a first time for everything.
That's a bonus to the point.
And then though he's applying it to the original point, not the bonus, even if...
I think that's what he's doing.
Right, and the original point was that we've never seen anyone do it before.
So we've never seen anyone do it before.
Oh no, sorry, you're right.
And in the future, you could create a shield that makes no fucking sense.
That addresses a future issue, not a past issue.
He shouldn't have began it with though, it should have just been its own statement.
You've got me, logic.
So...
Weirdo with his better than English than I.
See, I'm still good.
So this...
He didn't say anything about it, but I just looked at ER's Twitter.
And this Hassan guy who wrote that article...
Hassan Piker, yeah.
He's a Steven Universe fan.
And the video that was taken down was a Steven Universe video.
Of course.
Really?
I'm pretty sure.
So for those of you who don't know Hassan Pikers with the Young Turks,
he is Cenk Uygur's nephew, I believe.
Devin Tracey refers to him as Brown Fabio.
I don't even understand that.
And if it wasn't an ER...
ER.
Steven Universe video, he has made numerous Steven Universe videos in the past.
Which is just kind of funny, knowing that the person who took him down is a Steven Universe fan.
But yeah, I just felt like sharing that little tidbit.
Yes.
The sentence structure is poor on this, but let's just give him the most benefit of the doubt possible.
And assume that he's arguing that they can create a counter to the problem in the future films,
fixing space battles once again.
It would be the same...
Don't fix the problem of why nobody came up with it before.
Well, you have like a person, you shoot them, they die.
Then you have a cyborg, you shoot them, and it's bulletproof.
And you're like, oh god, this changed the stakes.
And then next episode, you have a gun that shoots and kills cyborgs.
And you're like, oh, nice.
And then you have cyborg 2.0 that's immune to that gun.
And you're like, oh my god, this is just fucking stupid.
And the solution, it's like, yeah, you don't create stakes that way.
It's like anime, or bad anime, I should say.
They just outclass each other's mechs all the time or something.
Though...
Yeah, level up, level up.
Like off the top of my head, they could...
I have a better gun now.
I have better armor now.
Well, I have even better armor than gun now.
I have a gun better with armor to bob it above.
Yeah, well, I have better armor times infinity times two.
Oh, yeah, but mine's plus eight.
Shit.
Build that's based off a hyperspace engine that creates a wormhole that will just make a lightspeed ship pass right by.
I can't believe you honestly suggest that.
Oh, you're retarded.
You know, I've seen this clip so many times over the course of this video now that I just can't help but ask,
why are these TIE fighters flying right in front of the shield that the ships are all shooting at?
Look how close those explosions are.
Like it never occurred to me before, but he's played this clip so many damn times.
It's just like, wait a minute.
Is this...
That's another problem.
Oh, it's great.
Every time we watch the TLJ video, we're finding new things that are wrong with it.
Yeah, I'll just read about it.
Part four is down.
Oh, shit.
It got a claim a bit ago.
The block extends further than Canada, though they haven't made me aware due to a copy.
So it's a copyright claim that it's down.
Okay.
That's kind of convenient.
That's good news in a weird way.
Like, well, it's really odd.
That must be connected, right?
This is as weirdly coincidental as what I meant.
Very curious.
Very curious, the timing.
Whatever.
Light speed weapons aren't the end all.
Someone could also very easily explain that the stars align just right.
This does align just fine.
The distances were just perfect.
Oh, come on.
My brain can't take this shit.
It's a one in a million target.
Really?
Then why would she have tried it if it's a one in a million?
That was the big plan, right?
All you had to do, and I'm genuinely suggesting this,
she full thrusts into the ship and they start shooting it to shit, shredding it,
but they don't destroy it before it can crash into the supremacy.
The sheer mass.
Yeah.
You know, hunks into the ship and then the next time we see the ship,
we can see the damaged section.
Well, you know, now that since she's turning around,
she can just flip those shields from the engines to the front of the ship
so that she can last a little longer.
Get in there.
Not only does this all make sense, but you wouldn't crack into the law
like with this shit, you wouldn't have to invent it.
But see, like being completely honest with you, cinema wins.
Look at what you're arguing right now.
Like, guys, it's not so bad.
It could have just been one of those one in a million shots.
You can't repeat that.
She really just was stars aligned.
Wasn't this this was like the the end point of the big brilliant plan
to save everyone and get them to this planet was a one in a million shot
that could never be repeated.
She doesn't even she's not even a Jedi.
The idea that you could get the force as a boaters.
Yeah, maybe she is.
You don't know.
It's true.
Yeah, everyone's a fucking Jedi now.
I don't even know what he I'm not even sure this argument is really
it's like you can only do it if if everything is in place.
It's like if what's in place.
It's like I don't know everything.
You know, all this stuff that needs to happen for this thing.
And someone just highlighted if it was a one in a million chance,
why would Hux act so terrified when she turns the ship?
There's no way that you'll be able to crash.
Yeah, you'd be like one in a million shots.
That has the same chance as a lottery ticket.
Who cares?
And then it just crashes right into something like, for fuck's sake.
Well, shit, that's a million target.
I probably can't be repeated with any consistency.
I know I'm fixing a genuine problem.
My point is just that it doesn't have to break Star Wars.
What do you mean?
Because in the in the next movie,
what will people ask if there's ever another space battle ever for Star Wars?
I don't I love it.
It doesn't have to break it.
It's like your suggestions for fixes are breaking Star Wars even more.
It's broken now, and it's not like it was never broken to begin with.
The prequels break things.
The OT.
I'm trying to think if the OT breaks anything.
Could you could you call anything that happens in the OT a break?
Or stretch.
I think some of the stuff from the first part of the turn of the Jedi,
like in the doesn't really make sense.
It doesn't really break any more.
I don't think it's more just like a stretch as to why the fuck it even happened that way.
The possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one.
Never tell me the odds.
Well, that's true.
That's fine because Hans, a great pilot and the ship does take a bunch of hits.
I'm sure he got. Well, I don't know.
I mean, maybe he got more piloting in between his solo, a Star Wars solo solo story.
I would hope so.
And, you know, episode four.
They're going to do the Death Star thing again with episode nine.
I hope so.
It'll be so funny.
The Death Galaxy.
It will be called the Baldi Dash.
And there's no point in comparing to actual situations where the odds are against them in other parts of the films,
because this is something he's invented.
He's just said the odds were against Holdo, but he's got no tangible numbers for this.
It's like, why are the odds against them in an asteroid field?
It's like, because they have to avoid the asteroids.
That's pretty straightforward.
Why one in a million?
Yeah. But to be like, why is Holdo against the odds?
Like, I don't know.
She just is, apparently.
Yeah, because, you know, there's rules about this guy's face, I guess.
He does not think this is a one in a million chance.
Someone just needs to break it in the other direction.
I'll break it in the other.
I'm picturing a guy breaks his arm and someone goes, I'll fix it and breaks it.
Is your OK?
This hurts my face.
It's like that part in the third Harry Potter where the guy's like, don't worry.
Is it up like 11 times?
Oh, right. Yeah.
The noodle arm.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't remember his name.
Is it Lupin or was it someone else?
Lupin was I know the guy's name.
Or no.
This is the second movie.
I'm waiting for him to chat.
Come on, chat.
Maybe.
I haven't watched.
I haven't watched the movies in like two years.
Please don't type it on chat.
On.
No, no, no.
It was the second movie.
Yeah.
It was in the second movie because it was the dude that they made lose his memories when
they pushed him down the hole.
All right.
I know the Roy Lockhart.
That's it.
That's it.
You know the Roy Lockhart.
Someone's a Dumbledore.
Dumbledore.
It was Kenneth Branagh.
Yeah.
Who directed Thor, by the way, I think.
He's the one who convinced Anthony Hopkins to not go into retirement, which is awesome.
Someone said, no, his name is actually Lee.
The only thing I know that guy from is Hamlet, which is kind of fucking nerdy on my part.
Yeah.
It's OK.
Hey, man, the Lion King is basically just Hamlet with animals.
That's your that's like your opinion, man.
Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?
That guy's drawn another picture.
I'm assuming it's the same guy.
I don't know.
I'd have to check.
No way.
Oh, my God.
That's it.
That's even more horrifying than what a terrible, horrible thing.
Oh, God.
Hello there.
My dreams, will you?
Oh, my God.
He's like extremely friendly, but he just speaks really slowly and breath.
Look, it's even got those haunted, soulless eyes I was talking about.
He nailed it perfectly in the bubble.
You can like make out a vague face that's screaming or something.
It's like several captured souls inside the bubble.
Like from Fellowship of the Ring when you first see the rakai in the mud.
Yeah.
You just see this like face writhing around in it.
Hello there.
Oh, my God.
He touched you with my salad fingers.
Okay, can we just promote this guy to like.
Insta-memo.
Boo and dragon.
Bow and dragon.
You win.
You win.
You've made too many incredible drawings to this.
I'm going to need like eFap memes as a channel on my Discord at this point.
MemeFap.
You should have a channel like the Argon's channel.
They have a ritualist art thing.
Okay.
I'm making note of that.
MemeFap.
That's a good idea.
I'm going to say that that was my idea, Rags.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
I'm going to steal it from you and future ideas from you as well.
I'm just going to steal everything from you.
Is that okay?
Oh, yeah, that's fine.
That's great.
All right.
Oh, my kiss is not.
Oh, there we go.
Oh, no.
I think my watch together is breaking.
Again?
You guys can still hear me, right?
Well, it seems to happen whenever my chat's frozen as well.
It must be because I, I don't know, looked at the meme.
You can't, you can't do that.
That creature is infesting your computer.
It's currently like breathing a sack into your hard drive.
It's funny because the chat on my stream is connected directly from OBS to the actual source.
So that's still going.
But my chat isn't.
I can't even get my dashboard back up.
That's lame.
Well, we can talk for a bit until my computer catches up because something's wrong.
Someone said every pause a meme.
I mean, it's going to be the name of the channel.
So I was thinking meme fap every pause a meme, every meme, the frame, every frame,
every every meme a fap.
That's disgusting.
You can't just go around emailing everywhere you go.
Oh, all right.
That's something's working.
Oh, God.
I hate you when you get to the point where you just have to talk to people.
You know, like you guys.
Disgusting.
We don't have to.
We can quit.
That's true.
So I'm.
Yeah, I still hasn't loaded back up.
That's a bit burning.
Wartime Cumberdale.
Are you not familiar with the choice of rusty spoons?
No.
Nice.
Stop it.
Now we're going to apply that voice to that horrifying little monster.
Rags, why'd you have to even point it out?
Why'd you have to find it?
You know what?
I can just I'll just read some super chats and hope by if I reach the end of it
that the fucking everything kicks back in as soon as my chat starts working.
I know that it'll be fixed.
Do do do.
Person A.
So objectively A plus B equals B plus A.
You can't argue with that.
Yeah, person B.
That's just an argument with ignorance fallacy.
Person A.
Oh, no.
Yeah, that's how it feels sometimes.
Hope ER didn't just get pewds channel nuked again.
Well, we'll have to see how this unfolds.
Honestly, it's going to be interesting because PewDiePie's possibly going to address it.
Who knows?
He does seem to address a lot of things that happen.
So.
Great things.
TLJ.
Nothing.
It's a mess.
You can polish a turd.
The visuals.
It's still a turd.
I agree.
If you have to turn your brain off to enjoy this film, did TLJ fans just forget to turn
their brains back on when defending it?
It seems that way.
I don't think I've ever heard a TLJ defender say you can only enjoy this film if you turn
your brain off, though.
I don't think they'd admit that because that would be pretty awkward, wouldn't it?
CinemaWinds replied to me on his video, but when I pointed out he was misconstruing arguments,
he didn't reply.
Kotel2 is great, by the way.
Play it if you haven't.
I'm gonna get to it one day, I swear.
Kotel!
Yes, Kotel.
Bastard.
Disney steals most of the new lore editions from Legends and then puts all the best stuff
in the cartoons.
The movies just don't have the heart in them anymore.
I agree.
Rey goes into the Dark Side headfirst, literally, and nothing happens.
But my friends love this movie.
One said, don't expect a Star Wars movie.
That sounds like the quinted logic.
It's like, that's only a sequel if you interpret it that way.
It's only the Dark Side.
It's only a Star Wars movie if you interpret it that way.
The only Lee I trust is Liebo, Renda Fields.
Is that a reference you guys know or no?
I have no idea.
Renda Fields.
You know what, guys?
I think I'm gonna jump off here and actually be a parent for like an hour or two before I go to bed.
This is better than your children.
What do you have to say to that logic?
Why is this all playing again?
I don't know. I paused it.
Yeah, hopefully you closed it.
Because it's terrible.
This leads a lot to desire.
I feel like...
Well, it's been fun for the last Mr. Logic here, but it's in the description of the video.
I can't post anything on my fucking chat right now because it's like dead.
Yeah.
If you want to post, be into it.
They could always give it a shot.
Yeah, I don't know. I just like a debunker.
I do like, I don't know.
Religion is basically mostly.
I'm like a fedora tipping atheist with an extremely tall fedora.
It's true.
Otherwise known as a top hat.
A wonderful sense of humor.
Black mask.
Always willing to have a chat, you know?
He's not like a hater. He's not one of those guys.
Don't worry about that.
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I'm totally a hater that just goes around and hurls insults at the religious and people who like the last Jedi.
That's what I am.
Specific targets for some reasons.
Why?
Those are my only two people that I have any problems with in terms of their beliefs.
Yep.
Yep. That's it.
But whatever.
It's been a lot of fun.
I hope you've had fun as well.
We'll have you on some of the time.
Maybe next time change up the topic to something that you have a lot more invested in.
I don't know.
Yeah. Well, you know, I have some investment, but like I don't have I don't have eight hours of things to say.
So I've been kind of quiet.
Bullshit.
Why you hold now is honest.
Yeah.
Do you even know half the time, you know, like, you know, my office is out here in the living room now.
And so, like, I'll have people come to talk to me and then I mute out for a while.
This is the problem with having having a family.
Yeah, it is.
Against that, dude.
I've learned anything from Star Wars.
Family is about pain, failure and betrayal.
So yeah, all the families end up dying.
So the Last Jedi taught me this.
OK.
Very good film.
You misunderstand its themes.
The themes.
Yeah. All the themes.
Well, the skywalkers are dead.
It's like, all right.
All right. Well, anyway, have fun with feels bad, bad.
The next you have eight minutes left.
So that's about three hours left of this hangout.
So totally.
What do you have?
Have you got anything new coming up that you could maybe be like sell?
I don't know.
There you go.
I can get there you go.
There's a bunch of links, three in a row for some reason.
It makes it so that you see it easier.
In the future, we'll have to introduce you to the wonders of Jared Genesis.
You know, that sounds fun.
You'll love him.
That sounds like a good time.
Be a great time.
We've never not laughed to, you know, having a heart attacks while watching a
Jared video.
Jared is a very special person.
And you should definitely have on your podcast some poison wolf.
Oh, I will.
You should talk about God with him.
Yeah.
He's a God believe.
Okay.
So we can talk about both at once.
He's one of the God believer people.
We can talk about the Jesus themes in the last Jedi.
That should be a good time.
Cool.
All right.
Well, see you.
See you.
Goodbye.
See you.
Oh, look at me.
I'm a guy with top hat.
So stupid.
Anyway, my my actual thing is working again, which is nice to explain.
We're at thirty four oh four.
Yeah.
That'll work just fine.
All right.
But yeah.
Check out his channel if you want.
He does religious debunking videos.
I think he's he wants to consider branching out to media at some point.
He's actually said he wouldn't mind making a second channel potentially from
it, which would be cool because I think logic has a lot of interesting
perspectives.
I've actually he's one of the earlier channels I ever saw on YouTube.
Only enough, which was neat.
Or at least I think he was one of the early ones when I was looking into like
more debate stuff.
I don't know about you guys, but it's interesting because he's he's just so
like classic YouTube in a way.
Before before the dark times.
Before before the ad pocalypse.
Before the PewDiePie.
Why we've never seen anyone hyperspace ram another ship before, even if there
has to be a first.
Or is it supposed to be playing?
Yeah.
God.
I want to make sure that you are here for this.
My head.
They could develop some kind of shield that's based off a hyperspace.
See, I can't get over those high fighters flying right in.
They're not normally that dude.
They're flying so close to the shield itself.
Yeah.
I will just make a light speed ship pass right by you.
Light speed weapons aren't the end all.
Someone could also very easily explain that the stars align just right.
The distances were just perfect.
And she really just hit a one in a million target.
I probably can't be repeated with any consistency.
I know I'm fixing a genuine problem.
My point is just that it doesn't have to break Star Wars.
Someone just needs to break it in the other direction.
That works.
I'll admit that the slow speed chase leaves a little to be desired.
And I feel like there were solutions.
The first order just ignored.
Like send a destroyer ahead at light speed and then have them come back from the.
We gave this argument.
I hate everything.
And he was like, you have it doesn't destroy the film.
It's like it precisely destroys the film.
All right.
It doesn't destroy the film before this point.
Well, the film does a great job of destroying it in every single scene.
So this from instead of putting in space, let's put it on a street,
a very wide and mile long street.
You're like, we can zap forward with to find this one car.
That's all we're trying to do.
We have 12 cars and they all have the ability to zap forward at any speed or
direction.
Let's all zap in the exact same position.
10 meters behind the car we're after.
Yeah.
You know how cops today, they'll like put down spikes on the road in front of a
like speeding car to stop us.
No, it's globalist propaganda.
Gotcha.
Anti individualism.
The other side.
But who knows?
Maybe it was just easier to wait them out.
Why enter into a battle when you can just blow up a dead in the water ship?
Wait, what?
The intricacies of space travel.
Sorry.
We need to hear that one again.
I missed that.
Yeah, I think we need to.
I feel like there were solutions.
The first order just ignored like send a destroyer ahead at light speed and
then have them come back from the other side.
Who knows?
Maybe it was just easier to wait them out.
Easier to wait them out.
What?
Certainly more faster.
Destroy all of the rebellion by saying, Hey, ship 17.
Go ahead and go in front of them and cut them off.
And considering how it ended, it certainly wasn't easier for the first order.
They kind of lost a lot at the time.
I was like, what are you doing?
Oh, we're just following them at the exact same speed that we're moving.
And we're just plinking away at them until they eventually run out of fuel.
Like,
What if they just sent like one of the smaller star destroyers to hyper speed
right through it?
No, they all, all of those ships move at the exact same speed.
That makes complete use.
Hyper speed.
No, because.
No.
Um, just just.
Just hyper fuel is very expensive.
What?
No.
It's nothing new.
It makes sense.
You just don't like it.
That's all it is.
You just want to live in sin.
Yeah.
Wolf wall of gay man.
What is it about soon?
Rags attacks gay gamer.
The opinions on Star Wars.
I was going to go straight down the toilet regs.
Is it rags has any issue with gays?
Okay.
You have to refer to them.
That's how they like to be called now.
It's the gays.
The gays.
The gays.
Why enter into a battle when you can just blow up a dead in the water ship?
It wouldn't be a battle.
It wouldn't be a battle wreck them.
You just zoom in front of them with one ship and you blow it up.
I like they can't have their shields on both sides.
So this follow up argument.
Come on guys.
The sci-fi shit has always been wonky.
It's like, so why are you spending so long defending them in so many of these sections?
If this is your argument, pick one kind of both.
Well, an artificial gravity and every sci-fi part of this film have always been wonky.
That's why it's fantasy.
That you know, it is science fiction just because they don't offer an explanation as
to why or how it's done.
Does it mean it's not science fiction?
Why is it that people like to change the genre whenever it benefits their art benefits?
Yeah.
And it's also a kids filled, whatever benefits them.
Yeah.
It's just, it's for kids.
It was very serious.
And it's very, they do the same thing with black Panther.
They're like, you don't like fantasy.
It's like, it's not even really fantasy.
It's like horrible.
As if fantasy doesn't have rules, though.
As if fantasy doesn't have consistency.
Lord of the Rings has rules.
That's fantasy.
Lord of the Rings never had good writing.
Boo.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
It's one of the commentary tracks.
Rich Evans says, well, they do the red layer meteor system and like, it only ever becomes
a children's film when things don't make sense.
Up to that point, it's not a kid's film.
It's fine.
It's, you know, it's forever.
It's like the second things don't make sense.
This is bad for kids.
That's super serious.
It is both simultaneously a children's film that doesn't have to make any sense whatsoever.
And at the same time, it is also a very deep and meaningful film that's full of themes
and literary sections that are put together in an intricate way to tell an involved and
depthful story.
Yeah.
I'm sure kids will understand the complexity of Luke discovering within himself a lack of
confidence in his own religion.
Like, what does that even mean to them?
It means me.
How strange that the Orcs have a word for me.
It really doesn't bother me.
We didn't ask if it bothers you.
It doesn't bother me.
It's just a frame.
It doesn't bother me that the Orcs have a word for me.
It's just a framing device.
Hey, come on.
There's the Isengard buffet.
They have menus for that.
I just, it's like that he's like, he's writing it off as if when the writer has to come up
with a framing device or a vehicle.
I feel like we have two conversations happening right now.
Oh, maybe we do.
We're talking.
We're talking about the Orcs having a word for menu.
Oh.
And you're talking about stone words.
I mean, they're the same thing, really.
Yeah, they're both fantasy, right?
Yeah, they're both fantasy.
They don't have rules.
But yeah, I mean, so a buffet would still have like a drink menu.
Well, that would just be human meat squeezed into a juice.
Human meat juice.
Would you like a human kebab?
They have a meat burger.
They clank the glasses, say, looks like meat juices back on the menu.
Who makes complete sense?
To be fair, squeezing out human meat juice is my idea of a good Saturday night, but we
don't get too far into that.
That is wonderful.
Get it because I'm a butcher.
I mean, that's like your opinion, though.
Like, I'm sorry, but the truth is the truth, Rags.
So anyway, Star Wars.
So, yeah, second deck.
He said it's just a framing device, whether or not the thingy makes sense.
It's like, man, whatever.
And I think Hux is just arrogant enough to wait out the resistance anyway.
What did he have to?
Arrogant enough to wait out the resistance.
If he was arrogant, he would destroy them as quickly and swiftly as possible.
And besides the thing is what could happen?
Anything could happen.
Who knows what unexpected thing could happen and does end up happening?
If you have the enemy in your palm of your hand, you destroy them.
You crush them.
You don't give them chance to have some miracle occur.
Lose really.
They also could have made hold of reason for keeping the plan from Poe more
apparent.
And this could just have maybe been handled differently outside of a slow
speed chase.
I will say that the obsession with fuel being the catalyst for the story is
weird, as if problems with ships have never come up before.
I mean, it's a running gag that Han couldn't engage the hyperdrive when he
needed to.
R2 was always fixing shields.
The Phantom Menace only ends up on Tatooine because of some part they needed.
Fuel is just another component.
Oh, so he's saying, like, why are you complaining about fuel when we've always
had ship things that go wrong?
I suppose the problem for us is it seems arbitrary.
Like the film was like, yeah, we're running out of fuel now.
It's like, no, we're out of fuel now.
Since when?
And it's like, we just are.
And it isn't like you refuel.
It's like, oh, we're running out of fuel.
We're almost doomed.
Not we can get a new part.
We can fix it.
To mention in the main series, I'm really trying not to be dismissive here,
but some of these companies trying not to be dismissive.
Please make it hard.
The real point I want to convey is that if you want to start picking apart
Star Wars and you want to not be hypocritical about it, you need to go back
to the beginning.
I don't know how much you can say about being not hypocritical there.
Mr. Cinema wins.
Also, when we're talking about the last Jedi and you want to say, oh, but we're
really talking about Star Wars as a whole.
Like, no, no, we're not.
We're not doing that.
We're talking about the last Jedi.
Seems seems like he has a lot of selection of things that are most convenient
at the time for explaining how this film works as well.
You see, the thing is, you can't even if we let's say we go with this example
and say in episode three, that's what happens.
Yeah.
If we say it's bad and that that doesn't mean it's not bad here.
It still could be shit here, too.
If it doesn't make sense elsewhere, that doesn't make make it more sensible here.
Start with fundamentals.
Things like why would the gunner for these bombers need to be anywhere near
the actual turret?
Yeah, he's in a giant glass ball outside of the ship.
Yeah.
In that same vein, they can't remotely control these ships that are about to be
destroyed.
Yeah.
Or like, since it's.
Wait, is he presenting?
I'm confused.
What do you do?
Is he leading into saying none of this matters?
Is that going to be the conclusion?
I don't know.
Got a fuel.
Just let it float until it stops.
It's not going to stop.
Reason is that it's established Star Wars lore.
No.
No.
No, no, it's not.
No.
Reason is that it's established Star Wars lore.
Decisions were made early on to look cool.
Is that a B-Wing?
That's an A-Wing.
What's the difference?
Oh, no, sorry.
That was an A-Wing.
I think there might have been a B-Wing there, too.
Go back.
Go back.
Bring back the tank.
I'm trying to, Mom.
Because if I seriously just saw a B-Wing.
He's in a giant glass ball outside of the ship.
In that same vein, they can't remotely control these ships that are about to be
destroyed.
Or like, since it's out of fuel, just let it float.
Until it stops.
The reason is that it's established Star Wars lore.
Stop the video.
Okay.
Yeah, those are A-Wings.
Yeah, there's an A-Wing in the foreground.
There's an X-Wing in the back.
And those are those fucking retarded bombers.
Oh, I thought this was a B-Wing, right?
B-Wings have like a...
Oddly enough, B-Wings have a T-shape to them and they fly sideways.
And those are bombers.
Oh, that's the B-Wing.
Okay.
...made early on to look cool over being practical.
I'm sifting through my Star Wars battlefront knowledge,
trying to figure out which of these ships are.
But it's not their looks that is the problem.
It's their capability that's the problem and they use them anyway.
Ninety percent of the shots made by the gunner on the bottom of the Falcon
make absolutely no sense.
What does he mean by that?
The shots made by the gunner on the bottom of the Falcon make absolutely no sense.
How many...
What percentage of shots do you think hit their target?
What is he suggesting? I'm confused.
What does he mean by it doesn't make sense?
Someone said the arguments are worse than Tommy Wiseau's acting.
I don't know...
What is he saying? Did I give you a set of the...
You can't have bad aim?
I don't know if that's his point. I don't know what his point is with that.
...abliched Star Wars lore.
Decisions were made early on to look cool over being practical.
Yeah, but not being as practical as possible doesn't mean that they are actively impractical.
He's saying the Falcon's guns are in a horrible shot.
Ninety percent of the shot...
And they have a screen though. It's not just based on their outside aim, like from what they see.
They've got a little screen.
Shots made by the gunner on the bottom of the Falcon make absolutely no sense.
Don't...
Why though?
I'm genuinely interested in that. I'm seeing if...
It doesn't make sense that three typefires would line up as she crested the ridge.
I agree with that, but that's this film.
If he's actually criticizing this film's Falcon accuracy, sure. I'll go along with that.
The Addats are like the dumbest version of tanks ever.
They're on wobbly, way too tall legs, super slow, and their heads, where they shoot lasers from, barely move.
They do exactly what they need to.
And they're pretty strong.
Yeah, they definitely have design flaws, but they seem to be effective in the film.
I suppose that's the question, isn't it?
Like, if they achieve what they were designed for, then perhaps we should be more lenient with them,
but to be like, well, they do that with the bombers, like at the cost of all of them, and only because they were lucky.
Yeah, everything is.
Every time we've seen AT-ATs used, they're used for assaulting a stationary position.
He's talking about the perspective of the turrets in the Falcon.
When in the turret, they're sideways, when viewed from outside, they're vertical.
So an editing inconsistency?
Yeah, I'm still not quite following on that one.
Vulnerable from every direction that is-
Real quick.
I hate to do this to you guys, but I actually got exams tomorrow pretty early, so I'm going to have to head off.
Why, they probably already know you're gay.
Well, Rags, you and me have already established this over the past several months, but no.
Yeah.
Well, it'll be fun because it's my last foray into college ever.
Hooray!
Yeah, well, no, not necessarily.
I still got a job.
But, yeah, it'll be nice to not have to do it, but I should probably pass the classes, or exams rather.
But yeah, so-
It's all right.
I hate to do it.
We allow you to leave, Wolf. It's okay.
Okay.
You're not going to chain me up or, like, whip me tonight, Mauler?
The second you leave, I will disparage you.
Okay.
But I wouldn't do that until you're gone.
I like you, Wolf. You're a good friend of mine.
Absolutely. We would never do that to your face.
We're good.
Yeah, of course.
The chains and the whips are for Rags, after all.
Yeah, I don't need them.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, I'll see you guys later.
See you later.
See you later, chat with you and your creepy photoshops and pictures.
I love you guys.
Toodles.
Toodles.
What a piece of shit.
That's all we got. Anyway, me and Rags will be able to kill the six minutes that remain with ease, I am sure.
Let's do it.
Head on.
This isn't meant to ruin Star Wars for you.
My point is that none of this-
I don't think anything is meant to ruin it.
I don't think they make something with the intention of ruining it for you.
The terrible design of the bombers does matter.
Like, a terrible design of things, like, a good example would be the guns on top of the dreadnought.
They're terrible, odd design that's apparently regressive technology-wise.
It does matter, because one ship can take them all out, which means that the bombers can come in,
even though the bombers get shredded by fighters anyway, and the surface cannons.
It all spirals together.
Things affect one another.
None of this-
The capabilities of individual pieces all come together to make excuses for why they need to have this plot happen.
I can't take him seriously when he's telling us none of this matters,
when he's just been going over all the arguments for why it's okay, it does make sense, it does matter.
It's like, come on, man, pick one.
Besides, the functionality of weaponry will absolutely affect the stakes.
If a lightsaber just stops working, you don't go, no, it's fine.
No, that crap matters, really.
I mean, how do we destroy the Death Star?
Well, these are our capabilities, we have to come up with a plan.
Yeah, it's nice and simple.
Like, episode six, it's open because it's not completed yet, but it has a shield.
Destroy the shield, you have to destroy the bunker.
Destroy the bunker, you gotta get a bomb in there.
And you can't because the door is welded shut, so they- well, it's just shut in general,
and so they trick the Empire into opening it for reinforcements, and then they get in, they destroy that,
it destroys the shield, everyone can get in and shoot the core.
Everything is running as expected.
You don't suddenly go, one of the guns doesn't work quite right on the X-Wing, though.
That doesn't matter, because it's like, it doesn't change anything, whether or not it did.
That's the important point, okay?
Okay.
Crap matters.
Hate the Last Jedi because of tone and style and whatever else, but stop with the inconceivable.
Lightsabers make no sense.
Yeah, they do.
I mean, it doesn't even matter as long as they're consistent.
Exactly.
As long as they're consistent, simple enough.
Also, can you see that shot? It looks like her hand is touching the saber light there.
I don't know if it's the same frame for you, but-
I noticed in a lot of her grip, she holds it really close to the end.
I've known it before, so maybe it's just the blur and the quality of the footage and the speed of her motion.
Motion of the ocean.
In addition to defending Kelly Marie Tran, I have nice things to say about Ryan.
But first, I can't defend this.
You basically tattooed please at me on your forehead with that one, Ryan.
I've never found much evidence to support it, but there seems to be a general consensus that Ryan and Disney were dismissive of fans who didn't like the film and wrote all complaints off as anti-feminism or anti-inclusion.
That's no good if it's true.
At the same time, Ryan's human and allowed to have emotional responses when people attack his work and obviously once his cast-
Tell us about your comment section.
I mean, I don't necessarily disagree with any of this.
I'm just like, fine, fine, fine.
Ryan's human, he's allowed to have emotional responses.
Ryan?
Who said he wasn't?
Yeah, but he is very combative and he will not accept criticism of his work as valid.
Some friends are being attacked, all bets are off.
But everything I read and watched and listened to from Ryan shows me he really is a Star Wars fan who was trying to make the best movie he could to excite the fans.
I don't think he's a Star Wars fan in his movie.
I feel like he was annoyed with how Star Wars had become entrenched in his own mind as to what it is.
I wanted to completely break down all of the things you expect about Star Wars.
Yeah, I just get this movie and I'm like, why does he hate Star Wars so much?
Yeah, like I said, it comes across like someone- the person who made it trying to fuck everything up by design.
And I'm just like, you know, do I call that person a Star Wars fan?
I mean, possibly.
Very weird way of showing your fandom, though.
Maybe not please the fans.
But he was trying to add to Star Wars rather than just rehash what we've already seen.
So, thank you for what?
Digging himself.
Thank you for that, Ryan.
And even though he was writer-director, you and I both know that every major decision had to be signed up on.
No, we don't know that.
What is he saying, that Ryan's not responsible then? Is that his point?
Yeah, even though he's the only credited writer-director, it's not like he- it's not his fault.
That's ridiculous.
It's not like people are saying that there's not additional people who are responsible for the creative decisions.
However, he is the guy who wrote the script.
And really, that's my biggest problem now that it's clear there was no plan from the beginning.
It's clear there was a plan from the beginning.
And you made this video a couple days ago, so you should know that.
Daisy Ridley accidentally.
I say accidentally because I'm sure they didn't want this public, but...
JJ had plans.
Ryan ignored them.
To be fair, there was no plan for the original trilogy, and that turned out fine.
But JJ and Disney knew they were making a trilogy and had an opportunity to at least outline-
I love that he's already counted his own point there as well.
The fact that there's no plan doesn't mean you should have bad films.
Alright, so explain this whole film.
Yeah.
Story beats, and they didn't.
Or Ryan threw them out.
There's conflicting information on that.
Maybe it's too hard to plan aside-
Why would that stop you?
Now he's saying this conf- I thought you just said that you started with nothing and now he's saying it's conflicting.
I wanna go back.
So your information is confusing.
He really is a Star Wars fan who was trying to make the best movie he could to excite the fans.
Maybe not please the fans.
But he was trying to add to Star Wars rather than just rehash what we've already seen.
So, thank you.
So, but if anything that just shows- and this means that you have to admit he's a failure.
Because if his plan is to excite the fans, make them excited for Star Wars, then he has single-handedly done what no one else has done.
I'm sure-
What no prequel movie has done to Star Wars.
He has ruined it for an insane amount of people.
I am sure that he would argue as long as he makes one fan excited, then he was successful in some way.
In some way.
In some way.
For that, Ryan?
And even though he was writer-director, you and I both know that every major decision had to be signed off on.
No, we don't.
And really that's my biggest problem now that it's clear there was no plan from the beginning.
Yes, shows.
So yeah, just keep that out of note.
It was clear there was no plan from the beginning.
To be fair, there was no plan for the original trilogy and that turned out fine.
But JJ and Disney knew they were making a trilogy and had an opportunity to at least outline story beats and they didn't.
Or Ryan threw them out.
There's conflicting information.
So he said it's clear there was no plan from the beginning.
Well, there's conflicting information on that.
Nice.
Okay. Thank you.
... on that.
Maybe it's too hard to plan this out when you know a bunch of YouTubers are gonna predict the whole thing.
Are you fucking kidding me?
How...
Guys, it's hard to make a movie.
The YouTubers...
The YouTubers has ruined it.
Come on.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's interesting that everyone kind of glommed on to the bad guy's commission.
Let the past die.
Kill it, if you have to.
Especially when he can't even do it himself.
It doesn't matter. That's not why we latched onto that.
We latched onto it because it's like a microcosm for how Ryan feels about Star Wars.
It's awful advice.
And by the way, people actually believed it was good advice who liked this film.
I've said it before, but unfortunately, Buggy's review of the film, he said it was something he kind of wants to live by.
The idea that you kill your past to get over it.
It's like...
Okay.
So, like, you know, people who like this film took this message seriously.
So don't even start with people like me in rags or people who didn't like the film going too far with it.
I'm assuming his argument is going to be the film condemns this line of thinking.
But, um...
I wouldn't say so myself.
He thinks killing Daddy and Mommy and Uncle Lukey will do it.
But that's not how that works.
I'm sorry, what?
He killed Snoke?
Does that count?
Move on.
Kill your past to become who you are.
He killed Snoke, who's clearly a part of his past.
And now he's able to be free.
Yeah, it's sort of...
The film kind of supports that.
So yeah, I'm going to have to disagree with you there, Lee.
And the fact that he's so obsessed with killing the past, a la allowing the Skim Speeders approach by letting himself be tricked by his Daddy's ship,
and then not noticing that Luke is a projection?
Look, I give Luke a bunch...
I don't know why he would have any particular connection to the Millennium Falcon.
Yeah, he said Daddy's ship.
I assumed it was Rey he was after rather than the ship itself.
He does say blow that ship out of this guy, but Rey is in the ship.
So on top of that, it's still...
That's a part of how bad Kylo's character is.
But that doesn't even...
He's saying, like, you see, and it made him lose track of the fact that they were attacking the cannon.
It's like, you do remember the cannon was successful.
So his choice to do that didn't affect anything.
It's like thematic versus mechanical.
Even though the thematic element is completely fucked, he's just not paying attention to the mechanics of the scene and what actually happens instead of just interpretive.
Ship, and then not noticing that Luke is a projection?
Look, I give Luke a bunch of credit, but Kylo is an attuned force user that could have sensed what was going on if he could just calm the force down.
But he's more obsessed with the past than anything else.
And then let's look at the evidence.
Rey keeps the Jedi texts, Luke embraces his own legend, even admits he was wrong about some stuff.
Even the OG...
Yeah, so I mean, the film is conflicting.
It shows us that both...
You should both kill your past and embrace it.
It's like, oh, okay.
Alright, thanks.
The master comes back and teaches Luke some stuff about failure.
Some stuff about failure?
Yeah, I agree. It is just some stuff, really.
Just some stuff that's 30 fucking years.
Just some stuff, most of all.
Just some stuff, change your mind.
The greatest teacher failure is we have what they grow beyond.
That is the true burden of...
Yeah, I mean, if you just keep dinging it...
All masters.
That was supposed to be the takeaway, not...
It's obvious that was supposed to be the takeaway, but it's conflicting as fuck.
Goddamn, it's not about... and it's so on the nose.
But I mean, we've already kind of said this in this video. I don't know why he's just harping on.
The Jedi, the rebels, let it all die.
Realize that failure is the best teacher to learn from your mistakes and be better next time.
Luke finally gets it.
How does Rey fail?
Luke finally gets it.
Luke finally learns from those mistakes that Ryan provided him.
Good job, Luke.
And Luke specifically wasn't killed if you have to.
He chose how he went out and it was peaceful just like Yoda.
Kylo wasn't even able to kill that piece of his past.
But he died.
So what the fuck is the difference?
But we do have to move forward.
Letting the past die can be painful.
But does anyone want Mark Hamill to carry every trilogy for the next 200 years?
Once again, something that we're asking for.
If you don't agree with his perspective, then you probably want this ridiculous, hyperbolic opposite.
Yes.
Do you think he wants to do that?
Do you think he can?
I'm going to stop asking rhetorical questions.
I know that you don't want to see this trilogy play out the same way as the original trilogy.
Of course you don't.
I would have taken that out of what we got.
I would have taken it.
I was like, I'd rather see this two good things over than one good thing and one terrible thing.
We don't need Kenobi, Skywalker, and Solo stories forever.
It doesn't take a gene-
Why'd you say this like we've had ten movies with it?
It's the OT and that's it.
Eh?
I mean, the prequels were technically about Anakin Skywalker, but I don't think that's fair.
He brings up the age of the actors, so yeah.
This is the original trilogy.
...is to see the Emperor Luke and Vader stand-ins.
This story could have played out exactly the same.
Instead, Ryan changed it.
No, they wouldn't have behaved like this.
Ryan changed it.
And if he changed it, that means it's good.
He subverted your expectations.
Oh god.
Just maybe not in the way you were expecting.
Why would you even try that?
Yeah, I didn't expect it to be this shit.
Why would he even say that?
It's like the-
Why would-
Not to breathe in the beeb, but it's almost like the standard response for defending the Last Jedi.
You just weren't expecting it.
Good lord.
I don't know.
The way people hate this movie makes me feel like I can't possibly be a real Star Wars fan.
It's hard for me to understand because this is what I was expecting.
You're expecting this garbage?
Wait, what?
You expected this crap?
Damn.
Well, see, but he watched a different film to us, though, because all those issues we've been highlighting, they're not things that registered with him.
He must have been watching some alternate universes.
The best way to enable this film's existence is to have a trilogy between this one and the OT that explains all the shit that happened with the Solo and Skywalker families,
then to drive Luke into exile as a result or something like that and bring him back here and then correct all the contradictions.
And maybe you can get what was intended with this film done consistently, but I mean, we're not there. That's not what we got.
Luke walked up to the dark side, took a step over to beat his dad, and then when the evilest bro in the universe yelled from the freaking far end of the dark side that he should join him, he was like, yeah, nah, I'm good.
Yeah, just referenced an old scene. Somehow that makes your argument for this film better.
Yeah, I guess. Yeah, that old stuff was good.
So, yeah, Luke doesn't buy into his own status, his own legend. That makes—
What?
That didn't correlate even a little bit.
It's like, yeah, he didn't want to go to the dark side, so Luke doesn't buy into his own position as being a Jedi.
Total non-sequitur.
Okay.
It doesn't follow at all.
Narrative sense to me. And I'm sorry, but I'm thankful he wasn't super optimistic and chipper. He was never like that anyway.
I don't get a sense. Jesus Christ, man.
You're a lot of fun, Lee. You're a lot of fun.
So I guess I still just don't get the problem. He starts out whiny, then he's sappy.
He's not whiny.
Jesus fucking Christ. Stop. He starts out whiny and he's sad for a bit. Just stop.
He has some fun with new friends. Then he's sad again. Then he's this.
Christ, man.
That's it. That's Luke Skywalker.
Leave the OT alone. This is embarrassing. Just don't talk about the OT.
That's Luke Skywalker.
And this is—
He's sad for a bit. I just—
He's sad for a bit. You know, his fucking uncle and aunt got fucking murdered with, you know, whatever.
He just had a bad case of the sad.
He's just sad for a bit.
The exact character that carried over to The Last Jedi for me.
He's not just like back to normal after watching his dad die after he saved his life.
That's not the end of the movie.
What are you even arguing for right now? He could be in any emotional state?
That none of this affected him or that it—
It's not like—
Jiminy Christmas, I don't—
It's nephew because of his adherence to the light, ironically. Dude goes into exile, wants to be left alone.
No, it doesn't.
We caught that bit, and it doesn't make sense. It's part of the problem.
It makes no sense. That's what so many people have an issue with. It makes absolutely zero sense.
His dad died, and he's sad for a bit.
He's old.
He's also old and sad.
That makes sense.
I never thought I'd have to double down on some stuff I said in my prequels videos, but it is okay to like this movie.
Some really intelligent people can be fucking wrong.
Some really intelligent people like this movie. You're not dumb, you're not a real fan, nor are you just a fanboy.
And there are also intelligent people who really dislike this film. Either side is right.
Well, we can back our side up pretty goddamn well.
I mean, this is the thing that the correlation, like, you're not intelligent if you enjoy something? Like, is someone's— I mean—
Yeah, it has nothing to do with your intelligence whether you enjoyed it or not. Whether you can make sense of it—
I like the room. Does that make me unintelligent now?
Fucking idiot.
Assuming whatever the argument— whatever, fine, moving on.
What were the themes of the room?
Friendship, betrayal, sacrificing what you—
Why did he just ding himself?
He likes dinging himself.
I'm defending and talking so much about the themes I've neglected so—
Oh, he dinged it for Han says hi.
Han says hi.
Right, neither side is wrong. Well, I've been defending and talking—
Oh, yeah.
Apparently that relates— that translates to Han says hi.
Oh, okay.
A bit awkward considering that's basically the only recognition Han gets in this film outside of someone telling Luke he's dead.
Yeah, plus these people don't know really about Han all that much. I mean, I guess he would be—
It's just so strange how they treat Han after episode six. He's like, what is his standing exactly?
He's supposed— he should be like some renowned war hero, you know, who had this arc and he did all these amazing things, helped save the galaxy.
Now he's just some washed up nobody. He went back to smuggling and abandoned this kid.
Yep.
And I'm like, what? What is his place in this universe now, you know?
Talking so much about the themes, I've neglected so many of the little amazing details, like the beautiful wide shots—
No, you've mentioned them.
It's in lighting.
No, you've mentioned the lighting.
Score.
You've mentioned the score.
Formances.
Yeah, he definitely mentioned the performances.
You can't even compare Hamill's performance in this film to the original trilogy because he's on another level.
I mean, it's a different level, that's for sure.
That's a weird thing to say.
It is a different level.
Yeah, it's like I'm quite a fan of his acting in the original trilogy, but fine, I guess.
Whatever.
Adam Driver continues to carry us along and I—
He accidentally just implied that Kylo tries to carry these films with his acting, because I could possibly agree with that.
Just replace us along with the film.
Someone's got to carry me into the theater to see the next film.
Isn't this true?
I really can't wait to see what they do with him next.
Yeah, he could be good, evil, halfway between.
Bad fucking—
Who knows?
He fucking anything. He could be anything.
He wanted to tear it all down, so he should be doing something completely different from Snoke or the Emperor.
What if he doesn't? What if he's the new Snoke? What are you going to do there? Complain?
Yeah, man.
Then his expectations will be subverted, which means it'll be amazing.
Jedi, I'm genuinely excited for episode 9 because—
I'm sure you are.
There's a story there, and I really don't—
There is no—
Okay, we've said this before, but I mean, it may as well just sum up quickly.
The component parts you're dealing with for episode 9 is you've got all the main protagonists like Raypo, Finn, and Kylo.
That is the main focus. Leia's technically not in it.
Three of them are on a singular ship, and that is their faction.
The other one is in charge of a massive, powerful, rich army, and that is his faction.
Go.
And you may be asking, like, what do you mean, go?
It's like, there's nothing else.
That's where we are.
There's no story there, unfortunately.
You have characters, I'll agree with that.
But you've got no story.
I don't know what it's going to be.
That's sort of exciting.
There's barely much to theorize about this.
Wait, sorry, did he just accidentally counter himself?
He said, there's a story there, and I don't know what it's going to be because there's barely much to theorize about.
There's a story there, but you can't even theorize because there's nothing to work with.
That's quite the story.
What a story.
You can't even fucking see what's going to happen in any way, shape, or form because it's limitless.
Sort of exciting.
There's barely much to theorize about.
The slate is nearly clean.
I don't know.
I've been accused of being too optimistic.
Well, this is the important part of the channel, I suppose.
Is the point of the videos just to be overly optimistic, unrealistically optimistic?
This one's unrealistically optimistic.
Yeah, because if it is, like, yeah, you nailed it, I suppose.
We'll see.
Longest conclusion ever.
If you made it this far, enough time has passed that I bet if you go back to look at the polls,
you'll see that the you either hate it or you love it narrative is a little overblown.
Just something to keep in mind.
Next week, something's falling off.
That's so fucking cringy.
Godspeed rebels.
Jesus, fuck.
Godspeed rebels.
Why would you say that?
Oh, we did.
Let's do it.
The one thing she needed.
Salt.
Godspeed rebels.
Jesus, fuck.
Jeez, like I.
I know.
It's like I felt like goosebumps on my fucking dick.
Jesus Christ.
Right down there.
That's unfortunate.
Well, so what do we think, Rags?
It was pretty awful.
Pretty awful.
It's like a lot of them.
I mean, it's.
I got disappointed.
He's just repeated so many of the arguments in the other videos that came out months after
the film rather than nearly a year.
Yeah, you'd think that this came out a week after the film was released.
And then there's a lot of just you have to convert your opposition into a crazy person
to be able to argue in favor of this film.
Yeah.
Strongman nonsense about Luke and all that and expectations and what they wanted from
the film.
Typical garbage.
Couple of cheeky lines in there that you gets close to being a little bit combative,
even though he said he wouldn't be.
He's very contradictive with what his own principles are.
And then he just seemingly references the OT in a way that's just I don't even know
understand what the fuck's going on.
What I will say is that possibly one of the better ones we've covered just because everyone
else is so much more condescending to the people they're talking to than this guy.
This guy is trying to hide it a bit.
Like, I know this is a controversial thing to say, but this might be the best video we've
covered, maybe, considering how much we've covered.
Maybe.
Yeah, maybe.
What do you reckon chat was everyone's opinion on that one?
You better love it.
We spent two episodes on it.
We did.
And once I get through these super chats, I think we'll be able to wrap up, which will
be a three hour.
You fat and we'll get loads of comments about how bad that is.
But I woke up.
I got on a fat and now he faps almost done.
Go to sleep.
Sleep.
That was my fucking day.
Yeah, we might have a two in the morning.
We might have a longer break again, considering the two if I was maybe I don't know.
I don't make people are going to take a little nap break and then we'll be back for
another fap.
And we're going to best video.
Yeah.
It's still awful.
Major Lee is definitely still the worst.
Yeah, I probably grew up with the worst.
True.
Oh, good question.
Because that is I think that is a personal slight for us, isn't it?
Like, yeah.
So I think that when you but they're they're different.
They're all different kinds of bad.
Yeah.
And again, to come back to the beginning of the stream before this one, the idea of
only positively covering films is not better than CinemaSins.
If you do it this way, CinemaSins is problem is that you invent issues with a film to
project its badness.
You'll have comedy that's confusing.
You'll have dings where you're just confused as to how they could possibly be
dings.
Reverse all of those problems.
Arguments that are confusing.
So it definitely has them dings where you just like what the fuck did they even come
from the contradictive language and pointing out positives in a film that weren't
there in favor of making the film look better.
That's the exact same thing just in reverse.
But people are like, well, it's it's in favor of positivity, meaning it's more valuable
because negativity is much worse than positivity by definition, right?
That's how that works, right?
I just I'm not a fan of either, to be honest.
We're going to cover CinemaWins again with A Quiet Place because I know me and Wolf
would like to talk about that film, but obviously we'll try and give it a bit of a gap.
I don't think he's terrible.
I just wish he would have looked into the arguments for this film a little bit more
thoroughly because, man, do some of these things feel like they came out like a month
ago, a month after the film, like really not looking into it much.
And I can't believe he really did argue that hardcore for Holdo's plan.
And it's just like so, like I said, just right.
And Patrick Willems have both given up on that one.
It's really just you can't defend it.
It's just that bad.
So also to those asking in chat, I'm working on a video now.
It's going to be a big one.
Do not you worry.
I'm also working on a big bit.
It'll probably be my biggest in terms of reviews.
It'll probably be my biggest thing, but I'm trying to really be thorough with it.
Yeah.
And obviously, if people wondering for me as well, it's Christmas Day.
You're going to get a near three hour video from me.
It's all edited.
I'm very anxious about how you guys will think about it.
But I worked on it for ages, so hopefully it's not awful.
Let's get through the remaining super chats then.
SinSins is Lee now, just to confuse you even more.
Fair enough.
I'm all a big fan, all stressed.
I don't know if Abby is still here, but I know her from other things.
Hello, and I'm going to remember to send you a message after this.
Assuming you've gone, because that was ages ago.
Sorry.
You know, it's weird.
The guy appeared, and then Kylo fought him, and then he just disappeared.
Thanks, Mauler, and backstory for Bilbo Baggins meme.
Oh, we're going to cover the video is from again, because I want to reignite that meme since it's still alive and well.
I think people are using the Bilbo Baggins meme without having any clue where it came from at this point.
It's that potent as a meme, but we'll get it back.
It'll come on Efap.
And yeah, if you don't like The Last Jedi, you're a white supremacist who chains women into your basement like Joseph Fritzl.
I mean, that's like your opinion, though.
Man, the drama between wolf and rags.
That was hot.
Oh, yeah.
See, this was a while ago.
He's still talking.
That was nothing.
The bombs might not be secondary explosions, depending on what the ordinance is and how it's fused.
I mean, sure.
Imagine if he slapped a private with PTSD.
The Allies didn't tell Patton about D-Day.
Would that make sense?
Imagine if after he slapped a private with PTSD, the Allies didn't tell Patton about D-Day.
That makes sense.
Oh, are they saying?
There could have been a mole.
But yeah, it's hard to relate.
I'm assuming they're trying to say, like, how much information would be kept from privates even in real life warfare or whatever.
But, you know, I said this on Smugboy's last stream, but Rey makes Windu and Yoda look like Padawans.
Yoda was the Grandmaster and we didn't know their backstories.
They were on the council.
It's implied power.
Yeah.
Being that they would have been there for ages, we don't need to know their backstories because we would just assume that they've had plenty of time to train.
But we saw Rey's beginnings, and yet she's super powerful.
There it is.
Anyone can lie.
It's the galaxy's most extreme lottery.
Billions of players.
Only one winner.
Better buy $75 for your chance.
Not a very stupid, amazing character.
What do you guys think of Avengers Endgame trailer?
Have you seen that, Rey?
I have not yet.
I would say we could watch it on this stream, but I'd have to keep pausing it to make sure we don't get copyright claimed.
I'll just watch it on my own.
Yeah, just watch it after the stream, I guess.
Misconception.
But Luke wanted to join the Imperial Academy in A New Hope, not The Rebels.
He says it in the film during the dinner scene with Owen and Baru.
Oh yeah, but isn't it to fight the Empire?
Or is it not?
I'd have to I'd have to recheck.
Holy shit, I just learned Holdo is in Jurassic Park.
Yeah, she is.
And decent character.
Ellie Sadler, I think her name is.
I'm in the Navy.
Holdo would be the CEO of the ship and Poe would be the Exo.
She absolutely should have told him the plan.
Failure to do so could cause this confusion, doubt in the mission, and discontent in the ranks.
Yeah, I would agree with that.
You don't understand.
We've got to think of the children, man.
Think of the money we could lose from these people.
We've got to have the money.
Yeah, it's the children's movies.
Totally makes sense.
Hard.
In the game, Eve Online, whenever you warp into an obstacle, the game law creates a bubble warp whim hole to avoid the planet moon space station.
Same principle could apply to Star Wars.
That still seems ridiculous, though.
Generally, like I know I think Halo does this and some other things do that.
But whenever you enter into like a faster than light, no sort of travel, like hyperdrive or slip space, you essentially enter like a like a like a different dimension in a way.
It's layered on top of ours that you pop into and then you pop out of it and that corresponds to a place on our map.
So you can't actually you're not actually traveling, per se.
In our world, you just appear where you do the travel.
It's like a separate road that you take and then you exit the road back in the same universe you started in.
Yeah, it's complicated cause incredible problems for any sort of sci fi world.
Yeah, it's funny because it's like, are we going to get some kind of crap from JJ to explain this shit?
I wonder.
I wonder if you'll do it in the game.
Oh, yes, sorry.
These T.L.J. defenders do not know that the empire had in the interdictor cruises, which caused a gravity.
Well, no hyperspacing, nor did Ryan, which.
Yeah, I mean, they might introduce that.
Who knows?
This is why you don't defend this movie, because the explanation needed to defend it a far more flawed than the flaws themselves.
Why people can't just accept it's a bad movie already.
One, I don't know.
It's probably worth mentioning, by the way, I did invite cinema wins onto this stream.
Like a week ago, whatever.
And he responded indirectly in a tweet.
He said that people want him to talk to people who disagree with him on The Last Jedi about his video.
And he said that he's made his video.
He wants to move past it now.
Awesome.
Yeah, fair enough.
I guess we tried guys.
Okay.
So much for so much for having comments and so much for talking and then ending.
Yeah.
Discourse.
So much for that.
When it's him, they done.
Yeah.
In the comments section, you guys should do this.
But when it comes to me, no, no, no, no, it's not for me.
RJ said she was false sensitive.
Why?
I am not sure what that's in reference to.
Is it Ray?
Because maybe it was Leia.
I'm not sure.
We knew that back in episode six.
Just saying that bubble creature has to mate.
Bubble creature.
Touch my bow.
Dash, rendar, Libo, Shadows of the Empire.
Ah, that's probably why I'm not 100% on that one.
I've heard of Shadows of the Empire, but I've not read it, I think is the correct medium.
That's Disney's Predator with Women, PG-13.
Sorry.
Disney's Predator with Women.
There is a woman in the new one, though.
There you go.
This is objectively the worst video you guys have ever covered, in my opinion.
Oh, yes.
Beautiful take.
Why can't they just milk the supremacy at hyperdrive speed?
That's a question we'll never get answered.
I told you we should have put more than 12 space bucks in the tank.
Star Wars is now Spaceballs.
There's a lot of references that make Star Wars Spaceballs now.
It's quite depressing in a way.
Why didn't the ship just hyperdrive the Raddus?
Why didn't the Raddus just hyperdrive to another planet and then go on the planet?
Because that's your opinion.
Actually...
Okay, so wait.
Could they hyperdrive just a little bit further forward to reach Krait?
And then, you know, poop out all the transports immediately?
Because they're undercover.
Like on the far side, maybe?
Yeah, because they're undercover, as I said, they're cloaked.
And then, why didn't they just hyperdrive to Krait?
I guess they just didn't know that that planet was right next to the place they'd randomly hyperdrive to.
But surely they...
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Surely they did.
But did...
But was their first jump random?
Or was it just like, oh crap, get us out of here, jump?
Or was it like, we're going to...
Surely they had it planned in advance.
I was going to say, how could they be that close to Krait if it was Raddus?
Also, I don't buy a we randomly landed next to a planet thing.
No.
Man, when you stop thinking about the film, it just keeps falling apart.
Like, why didn't they go to like an indoor planet or a Yavin 4 planet?
Or like a...
Why didn't they go to Tatooine or something like that?
Or Jakku or someplace?
Like some populated area.
Why didn't they just go there, just hyperdrive to that planet and then get off the planet?
You could hide there.
I have a solution to hyperramming.
Make it a WMD that the Empire wouldn't use.
A galaxy-sized shotgun that destroys planets slash stars in its path.
I think with the Death Star and Starkiller base, they kind of already ruined that.
Yeah.
Not to mention, isn't it a bit late for that now?
It wouldn't...
He says make it a WMD, but it's already been done in like a ship.
Unless they're talking about rewriting the film, which, yeah.
Mueller, are you a situation individual or an individual situation?
Certainly the latter.
Mr. Lucas had a plan for OTPT and ST.
That's a total lie.
There wasn't a plan for OT.
I used to respect this guy, but his arguments floored.
I mean, he just said he's conflicted on whether or not there was plans for the fucking ST, so...
CW is really good at praising great movies, but is definitely overly gracious with bad ones.
This is a prime example.
Enjoy the stream, boys.
I am glad you did.
Hopefully we went too harsh, because I know people really like this channel, but...
Yeah.
We responded in kind, is how I'd like to put it.
I meant General George Patton slapped a private with PTSD in World War II, and if the Allies didn't tell Patton about D-Day, would that make sense?
Slapped a private with PTSD in World War II, and if the Allies didn't tell Patton about D-Day, would that make sense?
I'm not sure...
I'm really not following.
Are you following?
No.
Well...
Let me take a look.
George Patton slapped a private with PTSD.
I mean, General George Patton slapped a private with PTSD in World War II, and if the Allies didn't tell Patton about D-Day, would that make sense?
I guess if Allied High Command didn't tell the generals and stuff about the D-Day invasion, then they wouldn't know what was going on.
They wouldn't have been able to coordinate as much as they needed to, so it would have failed.
Just...
Because Patton was reckless and impulsive like Poe.
By a TLJ screw job, he gave five dollars to clarify.
No, I'm sorry. I feel like it's my fault. My brain's not registering it properly, I don't think.
Well, your brain fart got you five bucks, so don't feel too bad.
Let's put it this way. If it's a relation to how stupid it is in The Last Jedi, then you're more than certainly right, just because there's so many ways to break it down.
There's that video that's called, like, a military analysis of The Last Jedi, have you seen that?
By Penguin, yeah. The Penguin, Emperor Penguin guy.
It's retarded.
Whoa, Bumblebee has 96%.
The what? What?
The new movie from Bumblebee. That's pretty good.
I'll take a look.
Pretty good.
Transformers Bumblebee.
They're comparing it to Poe. Oh yeah, I picked that part.
Holy shit, it has a 96% tomato. Yeah, 96%.
Is this before its release?
Yeah, there's no there's no user.
Because if you remember Black Panther got 100%, so.
So, yeah, there it is right there.
But yeah, that that about does it.
You know, thank you guys for it took us this long to get through the 42 minutes.
I'm afraid it was two episodes.
But, you know, these things happen.
We'll try and pick it up next time.
I'll say that every time until we slow down so much that we're covering one video per seven streams.
That'll be I'll be the day.
But both me and Rags have videos that are coming.
When would you do you have an estimated delivery date for yours, Rags?
No, I don't.
But it'll probably be within the week.
Well, there you go.
Thank you all for watching and feel very kind and generous donations.
We will be back at some point.
I don't want to say because now we're in December.
Time starts to get a little bit more complicated because, you know, all of us do Christmas related stuff, probably.
And new videos are coming.
And yeah, so no plans specifically for the next, but we will obviously continue it when we can.
Thank you all for coming and goodbye.
All right.
Did you say goodbye?
Oh, it was the goodbye is implied.
