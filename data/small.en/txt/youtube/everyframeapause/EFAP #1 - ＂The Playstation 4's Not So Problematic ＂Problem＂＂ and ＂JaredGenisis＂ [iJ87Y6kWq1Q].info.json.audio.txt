be weird
oh my god jared fight me irl bro what i just get jared videos
i get jared videos recommended to me all the time now which is off-putting but
you have done that yourself oh god it's like oh somebody does want to see jared oh he was
xbox jared before he was punky j and now he's jared genesis so it's like wow
it's your genesis then punky j then no xbox jared then punky j then jared then jared genesis
and that that wikipedia page is gonna have to be updated for like the next 10 years
it's funny um so much history to cover it's because it's like it's almost natural for us
three to be talking and cover jared i'm just like oh yeah you guys better watch both channel
otherwise this isn't gonna make sense there is a lot of unsung history
more it's hard to think you're gonna bless our souls with this time oh we got plenty to work with
also one day that's i mean i probably he probably hasn't made an apology yet
you've only got the tumblr one doesn't he no yeah he's only got the oh he's got one on kelly
yesterday here's the best part um he made a video about the girl who died and it's got a sad ending
and then he like he just uses the whole video to like make people feel sorry for him while he's
talking about a girl that was literally murdered it's like yeah a lot of people have been noticing
that he's been using topics to try and like squeeze in little things like lessons yeah there
was like one video where i think it might have been the one where he talked about like
someone that like commits suicide yeah nurse hangs herself i think something like that and uh he was
like sometimes when you're in a bad place you do things that are antithetical to your beliefs and
i'm like are you really going to just like it feels dirty doesn't it yeah because it's like
you're using someone else's tragedy to make people feel sorry for you when you should just apologize
for the thing you've been caught red-handed for and proven demonstrably when you showed your report
history i mean come on dude i wonder where he'd be right now if he had made the apology video i
wonder if his analytics would be like more positive or do you think people would just
if he maybe he wouldn't have lost 13 000 subscribers in the span of a week and a half
i'm not even kidding it was at 161 000 now it's at oh my god it's at 149 000 now
oh that's weird he gained 359 subs today also people saying crank up the audio everything's
on full for uh rags and wolf i don't know what to say i don't know how to fix it well if i'm low
then let me turn myself up hi is it saying i'm low because i can just up the game i mean i can
hear you guys absolutely fine but apparently they can't quite i'm set to 85 which is really quite
high for me how does it sound now my gentle viewers he's negative 7123
i mean it's still not going to be nearly as big as the mundane matt he'll recover quite easily i
would imagine angry joe but i mean there's like several days where mundane matt lost oh my god he
lost 2 000 in one day almost 2 000 yeah monday matt is negative 12 375
yeah he somehow gained 359 today that seems really strange it's very strange yeah because
matt's last video was a day ago it only had 8.4 000 views and it's at 14 positive
but do you want to are we are we talking about um the the kelly marie tran strikes back
well uh no there's the asia argento gold moves the goal post that was so free that's for pretty low
oh no i don't think so i was gonna say were you asking if you want to talk about uh what she did
oh sad sorry um well i'll keep i'll keep it up on a separate tab as backup
try pronouncing my name guys much love um thanks for the two donations that have just come in and
my guess would be sub sub basis banaji what have you guys got assuming you actually have my chat
up i don't even know uh no i was looking at um i was looking at uh let me go to yeah i haven't
been looking i was looking at either she the sabasis banaji or sub basis banaji that is my guess
yes and uh hello all we're uh we're doing a thing today we were gonna do the right opinion
but we're gonna delay that even more because uh we're waiting on rags to just get a few things
sorted out which will i don't know be yeah we'll we'll hope we'll hope for it to be within a few
weeks but it'll it'll it'll come don't don't panic for now we're gonna check out some of our
favorites all in a row if you've been following wolf's podcasts none of these people will be a
surprise but since it's on my channel you might be a little bit surprised um surprised and
delighted you'll feel a range of emotions that you've never felt before most likely being like
unbridled laughter yeah i was gonna say you'll you'll be very confused by one of them his name
is sarbasis banerji yeah see that's that's what i was going with uh i think it's just racist you
you haven't you had an inflection am i racist against um indians or pakistan whichever but
remember the guy they're both brown so it doesn't really the white guy did up whose voice that was
racist well even though it went on for like decades and everybody treated it as just a
character of his no racist racist i thought really bad sex i was like a big simpsons fan when i
heard that happened i was just like oh for fuck's sake we're gonna retroactively do that with like
every single well no i'm pretty sure simpsons responded by indirectly i think they had like a
little clip where um lisa reads a book and it's like really inappropriate and it's a children's
book and she says wow when was this made and then i think they have this moment where marj
says something like um certain pieces of art are created in times where there's different values
and obviously they're permanent but values change and then they both look at the screen
and it's like yeah so you know i'm glad they're not gonna be just saying we're so sorry we fired
him he's racist for doing that voice please forgive us um so anyway not every brown person
is a millionaire if you guys want to get started we can jump on to um the first which would be
this very beautiful man's gonna he's gonna share his perspective on having friends and i hope it's
fucking we attested earlier it's not very loud video this man needs to be immortalized in
wait well rags you might be indian by the way i'm indian well done oh shit was i right oh there you
go oh right that means i get all the money um yes that's how that works so um well i think i was
saying something about how they need to cast jared and and how they need to immortalize him
in a marble statue look at that love you molar drags fuck you wolf i love you too that's 200
fucking dollars yeah that's uh extreme i recognize that name as well i think he's i think he's done
this before i want to say that that sounds familiar yeah i get to 200 just for that last
god damn that was either a 200 piece of love or a 200 dollar shit on wolf he paid that much just
to say fuck you wolf yeah that's extremely kind thank you very much for the uh 200 um extremely
well what do you do two thirds of it are extremely i liked my 100 and you put a heart after it wolf
i'm sure it suggests you're fine yeah maybe he means like in a physical he may he means in the
biblical sense a literal sense you know well in that case no but symbolic the technical sense
who was that guy who made that video that was there was a what about hell wouldn't it on in doom
yeah oh oh that guy ah i can't believe he was hold on i can look it up uh hell in doom
see look at that molar hn entertainment to clarify i am still making the critique on
the force awakens it's just huge it's taking ages okay so don't worry this is me instead of you know
taking a break and doing nothing between writing my script and doing my videos i decided to hang
out with these guys okay it's fine it's still being worked on i swear i'm gonna start getting
loads of questions now be like where's it going i can't give an estimate so i'm not 100 sure but
patreon is where i update all of the they free updates so i don't have to pay for them there's
literal explanations of how the uh the work is going so it's all coming and i can at least say
it's going to be at least 13 hours in total so you got that jesus christ why do you do this to
yourself that's the funny thing i very cautiously say at least because i'm pretty sure it's gonna
end up being 15 what a beautiful way you know what that means if it's that long that means you're
wrong get long go wrong nobody who was that long was ever right it's true um you're not even wrong
so is everybody ready to hear jar genesis thoughts on having friends you know um absolutely i am i am
ready all right let the games begin i've been preparing for this moment my whole life
oh that is quiet yeah literally if i look at obs it's barely skimming like being registered
yeah i have my audio check your volume check your watch together volume make sure it's as high as
it'll go because it defaults to halfway it's yeah i i have it as highest and i have my speaker or
my headphones at highest and i can still barely hear him god damn it jared you got the lighting
correct but you didn't do the audio i'd rather have dim and loud than bright and quiet genuinely
i think the background noise of my microphone is louder than the video let's give us a give us a
look here so how i'm trying to figure out if there's a way for us to take this and raise the
volume of it um do you because yeah apart from
i don't know is it i was about to ask is this sometimes like why would anybody have
maybe i can look for another jared video there's already yeah i mean if you can find a loud make
sure you save this one though we'll have to find a way to watch it because it's gold probably
okay why is this bad shirtless
i can find another shirtless one for us i'm sorry guys i wish we could have watched this one but
it's just download the video normalize it but someone needs to have a we got uh we got star
wars the force awakens review by jared genesis and his hair is wait i thought he
go for it but i hope it's loud enough as well i'm worried that that'll be loud enough now
hold on i'll i'll DM it to you real quick you well you can just uh just type it in the message
and watch together and you could play it right from there oh i can uh you can indeed in the
chat just um link the video just copy paste it and then hit the play button i see he's
i didn't he converted to hinduism well which seems really strange i'm just i just want to
see how loud it is it's like please jared shout into the microphone is that is that a safe on
the right hand side of the screen oh my god what is that i think that's actually like the back of
a monitor it might be yeah but i want to i'm going to choose to interpret that it's a safe
i love the idea that it's a safe it's weird because his bed is no longer the flat plastic
table it's now an actual bed well we we can't we can't determine that but it's something different
yeah we can't we can't go too far ahead of ourselves and assume that he actually has
furniture i'm still concerned that we'll be able to hear this video though well we'll see
all right you guys it's a little louder this video is definitely
way overdue just like the last one
wait just stop it there i just want to see what what the chat says is that because i can hear it
but i actually have to hear it i have to sort of squint with my ears if that makes sense just a
little bit like make sure i'll keep looking for jared videos hopefully i could find one
bogey cam girl drama sound booster for chrome i don't even know what that is
sound booster for chrome let's take a look oh really oh my god oh my god why i believe
grade a under a committed suicide hold on i want to see sounds through that works yeah that's just
an extension you just click it there oh really okay let's have a look um oh yeah this one's
actually like this video is actually um positively received is it volume booster is that it
um i'm checking this out right now
i'm gonna do a bit of this is just right this is just a test here
oh that works really excellently what's the extension called like
let me let me uh get the link for it let me go back to the link
copy link address i just put it in the discord chat try that it actually works quite excellently
i love it it's called sound booster that works yeah i know it's like well give the people what
they want is this extension extension by clicking on this game oh is it literally three choices mute
mid and loud which one's the i guess i can figure it out
okay it hasn't done anything yet i can't tell which of these options yeah the darker it is
the louder it is much like nothing else in particular
so i have mine on like the orange icon but you can do like the red one makes it go louder
but um yeah green i think green is default and then the darker it gets the louder it gets
like red is loud yeah it doesn't work oh it's worked for you guys doesn't work for me
okay click it here uh make have it look like that you want it to look like this
yeah that's what i've got it as and it isn't working because it's working really well did
you guys have to refresh or was it did it just work it just worked refresh just in case
fucking communist the uk internet
are you sure that's the icon it's on try the uh try the orange and the uh yellow options yeah
let it play for a second i'm just going to change them as he talks and see if it does
anything i'll leave it in the link in descriptions when i figured it out when i remember the name okay
that is actually weirdly it started working when as i was playing it yeah boy so hopefully
okay audience is this better way overdue yeah looking looking at the levels on obs they should
be able to hear that now okay good do you want to go back to the other one would you want to stick
with this one um we could do you want to fucking just do this do them both i don't think we can get
through both well it'll give us a good laugh and it's gonna give the audience a good laugh
you have to wait should we let the audience decide yeah yeah do you want to see the star wars
uh the force awakens review by jera genesis or do you want to see jera's thoughts on having friends
oh by the way is that a title for the latter will be funnier however the subject matter of
the former will be fun oh those people are voting for both we could do both ask um ask um voorhees
oh yeah uh akiba voorhees what would you prefer he actually donated again he said
10 for each chin on jared and you've donated 20
here's the thing jared what you want to do is you want to get that like that goatee going
you know a little bit of that chin line there to hide it you know you really accents your
jaw there that's what you want to do you want to chris evans that bitch i don't think he said
anything yeah i'm waiting but it looks it looks like fucking 90 percent of people want both
yeah all right let's get a veto from voorhees we're gonna go for it let's let's go with it
let's hear the star wars force awakens review going to finish this movie like freaking a year
ago i mean maybe not quite a year but holy shit it does make it sound like he's been attempting
to watch the video for a year like he was trying and failing to and he just now was able to how
does his hair stick out in the way that it does he looks like a street fire character he's retired
for about three years and uh you know it's funny i was just watching a cinemasic or video and
i seriously believe you know that's consistent in the jared law he watches cinemasic he's mentioned
avgg had a few times that's like yep he just hasn't figured out what james rolf's real name is
didn't we uh you you made that joke with uh was it louise or was it wolf i can't remember
someone made that i think it was you rags right and he was like well i i said it one more time
yeah because because um yeah louis uh or louis said james rolf and i said don't you mean james
ralph and he laughed but he didn't he didn't know i spend more time scrolling through netflix trying
to find a movie and actually watching stuff and shows too not just movies but uh my my dad
recently got this new thing uh i'll i'll leave it in the link in descriptions when i figured it out
when i remember the name i forgot the name of it um it's a free app you can download but you have
to do a bunch of shit like it's complicated um but yeah he can watch it literally anything for free
it's amazing it's also important to note there is no link in the description
yeah he figured this thing out where he was like getting money from banks by taking knives to people
and just asking them wait wait wait wait wait decimal points to point over and then shaving
is he like sharing in like the amazing atheists lore with his dad
oh the scabbard but the point is here i never figured it out because it's not in the it's not
in the description i don't know what was his point an app where you could watch everything
for free it's like there is that's not a thing you you've been illegal you've been doing lots of
things you've been illegal you you you did an illegal you did a bad naughty naughty Jared
Jared look at him he's got that criminal smile yeah you go into jail you think okay
people like al capone have been here and they just go into the cell and you're sure they say
every Clyde has his bonnie but i shudder to think
wish i could remember that name to tell you guys but anyways
this app is so great and amazing and wonderful i can't remember what it is but it's great
you just have to figure it out yeah you figure it out right if i leave you no clues or anything
just look up illegal
google totally legal movie dad later there's like an offer to do it legally he's like no no
the illegal one please there's instructions on how to do it in the new movie um unfriended dark web
is that the name of the film i've seen clips of it on youtube is the subtitle actually dark web
it yeah it's dark web or dark net oh it's one of the two i think i think it's used incorrectly
yeah because i know that the one they use on the cover isn't the one they use in the film
i haven't actually watched the film on the film that that's what i that's what i heard from like
your movie sucks or something yeah that's what i was on the front says dark web but in the movie
they only say dark net dark net like like they didn't figure it out until after they finished
the movie it sounds like um a scare tactic that doesn't it for the audience because the audience
is like is it is the dark now a real thing it's like oh my god dark web there's like a spider
there's no lights in the dark it's fucking like flies it's like that scene in return of the king
with the really big spider and it makes me really scared to think about oh yeah shell up it's like
the hobbit movie the spiders in the hobbit oh wait yeah they were were they yeah i completely
i've forgotten the elf chick shows up i've forgotten way too much of the hobbit films like
i can't even tell you how they managed to fill in the time between leaving the shire and ending up
with the five war thing the funny thing is is that the battle the five armies in the book
takes up like three pages who's the person who made a joke where they were like the battle of
five armies there's not even five armies just four and because there are five armies it's just
the fifth one is so yeah it's more like a it's more like a group for like the four armies and
guys if we go by proper definitions you are considered a group not an army you're not even
half of italian you're not even a platoon it just came really late to the party and unfortunately
had an encounter with really big bear and some eagles oh and yeah so for anybody you'll be able
to find this stream in i guess i'll put it in my discord it'll be unlisted but it'll be there
if you guys ever feel like you want to watch it again i don't know where else i could put it i
could put it on twitter i guess to get people to be aware of it you know yeah make a make a second
channel for him hauling around that actually is the plan i've just been yeah because because
yeah because there's so much stuff that you do there's so much space in between the big ass
videos you do then you know little bitty drip feeds maybe could you know people some people
might people like confirmation that i'm not dead i think that's one of the uh the benefits you know
yes oh and i i know that you committed suicide i know that the dark or deep wet is actually a
thing i'm saying that it's they they're making it seem like it's almost like a horror thing
like to go there it's a dangerous place where people will kill you you can't get there through
conventional means all right here we go fuck what's the name of it's been so long
it's been so long it's been so long i didn't this wasn't even off the cuff of this he was he
didn't see it and then decided to do a review he just randomly one day decided to do a review of it
it's like if i decided to randomly do a review of the goonies one day like haven't seen in years
let's talk about it to finish it on netflix um i can't believe they put the star wars movies on
netflix because they literally have jack shit when it comes to anything like superhero related
are what does this have to do with the review of the force awakens i watched captain america's
civil war on netflix what the fuck i was gonna say i don't watch netflix but i'm pretty sure that
it's just the superhero stuff is everywhere yeah here let me log into netflix real quick
and just type in superhero i know that the only star wars movies on netflix are like literally
only the disney star wars so last time i checked if i type in superhero on netflix i get dr strange
guardians of the galaxy volume 2 the flash thor ragnarok um supergirl dc's legends arrow
the dark knight agents of shield batman begins black lightning etc etc yeah but they don't count
because they're devil luke cage captain underpants
captain underpants star role that that's probably here it's personal superhero
so um yeah jared i don't know what's saying i don't say man what say is to though there's a few
things you know there's some pixar movies which are probably going to start taking off why
what pixar movies are going to probably start taking off because of disney right i think disney
is going to eventually take their stuff off netflix and do their own thing oh i thought he meant taking
off as in doing well oh yeah if he meant taking off yeah that's true yeah pixar they're a bunch
of up and comers a little indie studio that's what i was i thought he was saying it's like pixar
they might do well someday i don't know if you've heard of them movies like toy story you know you
probably never heard of them i heard of the second one last bit yeah like really bites like it's just
it's so terrible i i can't believe it's still as popular as it is well then again no i take that
back i can understand because of all the you know crazy liberals and stuff who likes stupid sgwt tv
but not like jared because he's an alpha what movie is he talking about
i i don't even i missed the point i think we're gonna have to go back because he's like jumped
on something here yeah movies on netflix because they literally have jack shit when it comes to
anything like superhero related or super popular and trending like there's a few things you know
there's some pixar movies which are probably going to start taking off but uh netflix really
bites like it's just it's so terrible i i can't believe it's still as popular as it is well then
again wait so netflix is liberal netflix yeah like netflix as a service um uh i love how this
jared genesis video reviewing the force awakens has somehow turned into a netflix review after his
illegal downloading you wanted to share he wanted to share it but he couldn't figure it out and he
never put it in the description so don't worry about it such i've never heard anyone refer
to netflix as liberal but fair enough me neither i've never heard of that maybe it's because the
last jedi's would got them to remove it might have been because that whole like um what was it called
dear white people oh that was a show on it wasn't it yeah yeah that that went well that was
the thing is netflix must have a couple of things on there that would be considered and maybe not
anti-nsw but the kind of stuff of the sjw people would be upset with because they have like a huge
library right oh yeah i'm sure without a doubt without a doubt it's got to be something on there
yeah i'm sure i'm sure there's something like anti-furry yeah because of all the you know crazy
liberals and stuff who likes stupid sjw tv shows like what all these other crappy netflix originals
netflix netflix no it's only you know if you have multiple netflix it's netflix is plural
of netflix i'm curious if he thinks like house of cards or uh stranger things is liberal
i don't know that would be good you see when to explore your mind when the children went into
the evil monster place and the school that was clear if you look at it jared theory
you know if we ever get to talk to just right again we need to ask you it's like have you
studied jared response theory and you'll be like i'm sorry what is that and then we're like oh it's
it's a very particular lens it's a very specific lens it's very specific oh who are we kidding
he's never going to talk to us he won't talk to us
this is just going to be a short review you guys most of you have seen this movie
hey he said shorter reviews longer than fucking the last jedi one and he barely talked about the
last jedi during the last jedi review so it wasn't even like a star wars discussion well that video
was more of a force awakens review in itself but he didn't really know what movie he was referencing
at any point of time so he confused them at the beginning a little bit here but i just can't wait
for him to talk about south vader's scenes aw man it's gonna be great awakened so this came out
i believe it was like three years ago now three years ago you know whenever it came out you know
winning whichever year it would be three years this christmas but nobody's cap tech i suppose
yeah he's counting yeah about three years ago i remember when i was like going to target
you know the different star wars characters and i was just thinking to myself like what the hell
why did why are they why did he get to the movie but let me talk to you about going to target with
my mom when he goes there he's like he sees all his curse he just puts one he goes he like
goes down on one knee and puts his head to his chin like hmm and stares at them like the workers
like excuse me sorry could you imagine like who's that greek philosopher who has the the statue of
him thinking it's just the thinking man oh oh i don't know okay that's fine yeah what if we had
statues mirroring like completely shirtless like this
it's just rub his belly for like wisdom like a voodoo statue for wisdom
it's also strange that this this is clearly an adult and he's talking about going to target with
his mom i don't think i can tell you the last time i went to went shopping with their brother
it's a beautiful experience i think we can all agree i can't even remember the last time i went
to target i was expecting to get immediately offended too just like uh star wars related
things what is this it's just like sorry man it's okay so gay it's when so losers
not alpha enough you know i'm actually i just have to say this i actually did enjoy the movie
but did you watch it all out of the three movies that recently came out the rogue one the last
jedi force away the rogue one i think the rogue one it's almost like an incomplete title like the
rogue one whichever one that was on the rogue one oh what what time is it on the video for you guys
it's not showing for me uh three minutes show for me either huh three minutes for me all right let me
just so that i can scoot back if i need to the rogue one it's it's like that uh it's
the sequel to the last samurai yeah the last samurai the last jedi
the bushido awakens
the um force awakens because i don't know why that is but most people seem to at least be more
the most holler right now because i look at this dude that was
i love how he decides to do this in the middle of his video oh man i think most people gravitated
towards the um force awakens because i don't know why that is but he said the reason i he's
like i think people gravitated towards this movie is because i don't know why that is
and like sometimes you forget that his sentence is conscious to itself
jared why jared we don't deserve him blessed jared we really don't at least i like there's
a fucking halloween pumpkin in the back of the room like he's fucking ready to go check
the cheating well i mean he's already got a good costume right now it's fucking been there since
halloween and he just left it there for next year why bother taking it down
he came home October 31st put that with that there and he's been sitting there
it is August it is two months away from the next time he'll be here
guys we got we're already three minutes in
it doesn't even take a lot it takes a lot to get my jaw sore but man i'm feeling it
man just the fact that he has that that little pumpkin in the back he's got a fucking safe
though the safe is where he keeps all the half eaten yo yo
he always starts a new yo yo oh my god oh my god all right okay okay i think we're okay
i think we're the most hollering of that movie which i find funny
goes for a second but anyways um oh god i've also heard people say
it's a fucking teenage mutant ninja turtles cup of course it's gotta stay internally consistent
with his own see like it just makes sense doesn't it in the inside and it's beat to shit too he's
had that for a while i think it says cowabunga on the bottom of it i think so he was like oh
i'm so thirsty but anyways um i've also heard people say this is just a um it's like a clone
of a new hope star wars a new hope which i've never really seen
remember he's got a video on his channel called why the original star wars movies are over
i love how he's gonna give us his perspective of whether or not it was a clone without having seen it
but they probably put enough things in there to wear maybe just barely you know different and
i think it was
gotta pick out the earwax hopeful sentence oh my god to captivate gotta pick his nose now
trying to bring them in but the last jedi was a completely new movie and so was road one um
so disney i think they were actually pretty smart in doing that um
um but i just have financial advice from jared genesis that was a good corporate move
disney gets the seal of approval from jared genesis
when it comes to remakes and stuff like that
he hasn't talked about the fucking movie at all
this is an 11 minute video we're four minutes in and he hasn't said a fucking word
it's always the thoughts that somehow relate to it it's never the actual thing
oh boy i don't really that's like a jared genesis video is like a mystery box
hey hey it goes in turn with uh with the force awakens
you never know where it's gonna go or leave it's like a box of jared's you never know what you're
gonna get let's be perfectly honest we really do not know what we're gonna get with these videos
hey uh we should stop judging you by these titles we should pick them at random
i believe it needs to be remade um that's just how i feel you know uh okay that's my own opinion
but just his opinion you guys still enjoyed this movie i thought that it was a good movie
um i enjoyed all the special effects and um tired he's already struggling to say anything about it
yeah he's like man i've been thinking a lot i'm tired my brain's been working on overdrive
for this one if we could literally nothing about the film we could break the the review
down so far he said it's good special effects are good that's where we're at he liked it it's good
he enjoyed the special effects here it is our special effect
tell me i just have to say this
like i haven't seen look if there's any time to groom yourself it's when you're on a webcam
making a review for a movie wait hang on what was he about to say there i want you to get this
full sentence because i have a theory of what he's got to say wait to confirm
i have to say this like i haven't seen a new hoe um i've seen maybe bits and pieces of it but
i haven't seen a lot of old star wars movies all the way through because i felt like george lukas
was somewhat of a try hard and he turned his mind it's like okay he's about to deliver a criticism
of the ot it's like we're ready let's go it's like george looks a try hard what do you do with
that hard to make good movies so i'm not gonna watch him i have no idea what to make of that
he's a try hard okay i said yeah he tried hard uh he said himself that he wanted to make them
like soap operas and i think there's a time and place for everything and when you try to make
something like that a soap opera it just gets kind of ridiculous you haven't seen them you haven't
what nothing's as ridiculous as this video i don't even know what to say there's nothing to
there's like no foundation to build a response to he was he's trying too hard to make it a soap opera
i don't understand that's not to say that a movie can't have substance or story but george
it's not to say that a movie can't have substance
it's just not just you know not these movies i guess thank you for your insight jared
he's an extremely overrated movie film director uh it's a screenshot um i i probably would enjoy
these newer star wars films more yeah because i have less story and they've tried less hard i guess
it's also try hard you know that's just my opinion that's just me everyone's different
you know i i don't have the nostalgia that a lot of people have and that's another
different song though when i was a kid i didn't watch star wars movie i thought it was weird
actually was kind of creeped out by the stormtroopers i thought they were
stop watching it because the stormtroopers spooked him
he started to play a new hope it's stormtroopers show like 12 seconds in so like what does that
have to do how did you watch the force awakens during that and also how do you have this
perspective that you try hard to make a soap opera when you were afraid of the storm i don't even
understand at all he hasn't even talked about the force awakens he keeps finding ways to avoid
talking about it yeah there's some people like me where i watched like jurassic park when i was
like four years old and that scared the shit out of me but then you have jared and he's scared by the
stormtroopers fucking white people man oh that's it you know what he was hiding under that fur
uh no seriously like i don't have nostalgia and if i did have nostalgia then maybe i you know
maybe i would be singing to a different tune so singing to a different tune that's just how
he said so to speak he's got to serenade that tune i would be singing to a different tune so
to speak why did you make it so complicated
i'm sorry if some people can't accept that a lot of people get buttered on my channel
bro like people can just they cannot handle different opinions i've learned that about the
your genesis the philanthropist dude this is the beginnings of jared response theory this is it
dude this definitely is the thinking that it all began in target 1999
there's something about humans in their brains there's some kind of disconnect where they just
simply can't handle people who think differently from them and it's really so sad but anyways guys
i know i didn't really run goo
why did you title it that yeah like remember after you you put in the title as it's rendering
you didn't have to call this the force awakens you call this you could call this i don't know
sure this is a tri-hard random thoughts about things ended it in like six different areas and
he'd be like oh well you know i was about to say as a jared aficionado when he says anyway guys
that's the signal for the end of the video anyway guys he says anyway guys but he's ending it we've
still got a while left oh yeah we're six and a half minutes in and he's not said a fucking thing about
the movie maybe he'll remember maybe he'll remember yeah but uh but i just have to say
it it was a good movie like everything the acting the visuals um the fight scenes were beautiful i
mean just uh every the way he was presented i i thought it was actually a really good sure you
did so whether or not it was a remake um i still think it is worth watching if you haven't seen it
by some chance you haven't seen the force how does it keep forgetting that every single time
he's like remember what's the name oh yeah the force awakens that's the movie i would recommend
you do uh it's streaming on Netflix i mean at least just watch some of it dude you know
you don't have to watch a whole movie uh some people you know i i think people like me and
others i'm maybe it's just because i have a short attention span which i think you think he
says this in the midst of like this this fucking room that looks like it was a war zone
no it's it'd be like so do you remember what you said at the beginning of the video he'd be like
no that's long god like that's it's just been a journey to get here man
you can still enjoy a movie without watching all of it um if you really enjoy it you know if you
find yourself really captivated to it there's just something about it when you know when you
have that feeling where you're just really captivated that's when you should watch it all
i'm sorry did you just say you don't have to watch the whole thing but this is a film that
really captivates it's like apparently not yeah if it captivates you then keep watching
it's one of those films you can just drop out whatever you want just show up whatever you need
the story didn't make any sense anyway i was captivated by the bear scene from annihilation
nothing else in that movie two note both before and after that
there's nothing wrong with just watching clips of a movie or you know half of it uh i'm not one of
those people that feels like i have to watch it all if i don't even like it that much what's the
very epicurean philosophy coming i've never heard anybody on planet earth argue this like yeah you
can just watch clips of a film you don't need to see the whole thing yeah because if you don't like
it then why watch it you know even if you're gonna review it you know if you don't like it
then what's the point well guys we gotta remember we no one else in the world uses jared response
theory in the way that jared uses it because you know what he does it okay the way he does it
we just picture him debating just right and then he's like why do you watch the whole movie
but just right what he's like just right is struggling to come up with an answer i never
thought about it yeah he actually like changes just writes by this is the one
opponent that jared i heard that uh just right can't uh can't break i would love to see jared
genesis in a debate well you know what he he did call out ben shapiro so i'd love to see him like
like how how long do you think it would take for him to like actually break ben shapiro's brain
a few minutes i don't know if he would he'd be like hello bed he'd be on the stage he wouldn't
have a shirt on ben would just be like looking at him with like a really are you who i'm supposed
to be uh debating here today no and then he just like looked at him with some really
off-put expression like he's he gives him the thinking man because i walked into his tears julie
like how could we have that stupid hat on then like this is the abaca i wear it because i'm
an orthodox jew and then my doctor my wife is a doctor the bed is bed's fierce shoes he's wearing
a hat because of his hair yeah maybe you should take off that bird you're wearing
and now we're from our sponsor jared would probably be like i used to have a haircut
that anyways guys i hope you enjoyed this there you go that's the second ending i hope you guys
i hope you guys enjoyed it was three minutes left he did exactly the same thing in the last
keep an eye i want to see if we get a third anyway guys
i don't know why i have trouble remembering that because you're an idiot so yeah uh we'll see what
happens with this uh next star wars movie you know it should be interesting because um
um
he would have rendered this video why can't you cut can't you cut like just cut i think he's
talking to the mirror as he's doing this he's talking to the webcam like you you know that
you're being watched you know that i just go for it no time like the present well you know what
there's an authenticity to this that's just unparalleled by any other youtuber because
he is so honest that he will literally pick his nose and clean out his ears and drink right in
front of you with his safe in the background with his little pumpkin there with his baby wipes
you bring all this shit up but he's just like i don't understand what's the problem
so there's no there's no problem no problem is that a fucking cat in the hat thing back there
you see that right right right by the by the red the red bin yeah the red yoyo
oh yeah i think it is very likely with the big green dinosaur in the far right corner
it's like i see you're a reader uh jared uh do you have any favorite authors he's like yes
dr suess
ridiculous i think i need to blow my nose but
what was he looking for what was he looking for
so to blow his nose into it he was like that's my he was he saw his bed he thought about it
he fucking thought about it this guy is the treasure troll maybe he was gonna sneeze and
he he was thinking about sneezing on to his bed and don't get the wrong idea folks we would
encourage subscribing we would uh we would say this is one of the this is genuinely if you can
subscribe to him and just make sure that he keeps making videos i mean that's all we need in life to
the point where wolf gets him as a guest on his podcast that's the goal yeah i've already subbed
and thumbed up man i'm there yeah guys comment and tell him that i want him on my podcast and
i will do anything to have him on my podcast literally anything to have him on i think i
need to blow my nose but
that for your nose yeah should be interesting uh didn't you just say eddy way guys again
i appreciate that was three uh let's uh we'll check just make sure just make your show new
star wars movie it's just before that should be interesting uh i don't know what they're gonna
try to do but um i have to say though that i i really did enjoy that dude that um fucking what's
his name the guy with the long hair oh my god i don't think he fleshed in
i was gonna say let's assume for his benefit this is kylo he's talking about i think it could be ray
he referred to kylo as the guy with the long hair in the podcast we did and that was seven months
after he posted this video so he learned his name he learned nothing he learned absolutely
he's still going off of bay maree
oh i guess luke didn't have long hair
that's like that's like the thing the whole film runs on that's like the center of the film
oh he caught he caught himself he caught himself took him a while but he remembered that luke
was Darth Vader's i remember he still thinks that ray is the one that killed him so that's true i
guess he's never been corrected yeah he looked kind of like emo with the big nose and uh
that's jewish are you asking us jared this is that a typical trait of emo big nose
i i i guess it is now in the jared lore i was gonna say it's jared lore so it's definitive but
uh i have never heard that before emos have big noses it's like yeah i thought that was a jew thing
like ben shabir i have to get my i have to get my book of stereotypes
uh he kills Han Solo at the end sorry guys for the spoiler
where he just like says oh this person died sorry for this
duels in love by the way that a lot of people will bring up a spoiler because they want to
talk about it but he's literally just gone he dies it's a spoiler so anyway guys
at the very least he takes upwards of a year to make a video review on anything because at this
point this was like two months away from the last jedi coming out so you know at that point at least
everyone already knows so what's interesting is that he has another channel called brother jared
and because because when i subbed um here let me i'll put that here for later viewing for you
gentlemen but what's interesting is that when i subbed to him it got recommended and one of the
recommendings was boogie wait what they associate boogie with jared jesus
that's for some reason i don't know man i think oh brother jared does he still actively upload
there his last one was 11 months ago but it's still i mean that's the guy brother of jared
as long as i know every single jared channel i'll be fine he would have purchased the jared
genesis anthology i want to write a book about this man like like a biography
just just the front of the book is just jared oh my god and on the brother jared channel it
shows him having the two mattresses oh definitely he did have them it does it was jerry's upside
down did you fucking eat him he's got like a giraffe toy on the dabbing on my haters video
it would explain his weight gain just grew too big for his shirts
yeah that's what he doesn't wear what happened to his guitar talking elsfema camps now in place
dude this the pause that is right now oh my god the way the way it's paused right now would be
like one of those red asods paintings that's like a downward title it's like a downward thrust
fucking oh here's one homosexuality and why it's a i would love to see that did the holocaust really
happened dude this man is this man is a treasure trove dude this the holocaust one it's been um
it's been um identified as inappropriate or offensive it's good i don't understand how it's
up but i would have thought like you'd get fucking plenty of trouble for that but whatever
i understand and wish to proceed oh my god oh my god he's got like six piercings in his ear
i know he's one of them's like both ears like it's like an industrial bolt dude he looks like
like an actual 70s hippie right now and he fits in weirdly perfectly he has an avatar review
um uh a jack jack review jack he's a friend of his he's reviewing
well i'm searching for the word review and there are 30 returns oh my god that free willy one
boogie's weight loss surgery fail oh god here's one free watermelon and fried chicken
the purple hat that's the title that that is the entire title
it's 43 seconds long jared doesn't alter he's a he's a revolutionary he'll be looked at as a
prophet when uh when we're old personal message to my trolls world war three is about to happen
i said that two years ago well amd versus intel the autist wars continue is life just a simulation
wow no i don't want to believe you're not real jaron we need to believe you're real
if we get these two minutes out of the way i'll actually start reading uh
the the super chest i feel guilty ignoring everybody growing up white and poor yeah i
really enjoyed his performance that guy's a really good actor whoever that guy is he was also in the
last jedi i would i would assume kyla red would be yes because he didn't die in this one
and he's central to the plot he will be in the sequel to the film it's not like he was in the
trailer or anything he's also in the next one he was in rope one i don't even remember
jedi um maybe he was in rope one i haven't finished yet i haven't finished yet
i haven't finished yet review review in progress
also kyla red might be in it i'll be finishing rope one here pretty soon and i'll go ahead and
give you guys a review well it's been seven months and he still hasn't finished that one so
yeah it takes a lot of time to gather your thoughts okay we gotta wait for these quality
videos this video by simply saying this uh to the haters yeah mauler yeah baller you hater
i am absolutely a fan this this is addressed to you so listen up all right go by simply saying
this uh to the haters uh forced awakened guys listen you're letting your nostalgia make you
that way this movie forced awakens it wasn't a bad movie whether or not it stayed true to the
roots of star wars i mean how would you know it's kind of a yeah just still haven't washed
yeah take off this nostalgia goggles waller this movie was great i mean the center the
fucking special effects kylo ren was in it irrelevant i mean of course it should but i'm
just saying even if it didn't excuse me even if it didn't all the way it was still a good fucking
movie man and you can't deny it well there you go mauler you can't you better you better delete
that script now fuck and start working on something else i know jerry genesis owned you i'll be
defying the message of jared if i release my videos exactly imagine how can you do this far
into your script and your review and your clips and footage and then jared jared just knocks it
out i'm right here i might actually i've already made something of an intro that i'm really proud
of and i might actually inject him into it now just because of that quote where he's like you
can't you can't deny it's good please please and if i if i watch a video and i just randomly see
jared's face on the screen i'm gonna i'm gonna make a note jared
i will be so happy if you do that 9 20 that should be enough and i will remember
some of you guys you're just i think a lot of people have a hard time accepting change
that's what it all boils down they don't want an inch of anything moved you know from their
childhood uh you know they don't want an inch of anything changed uh from their childhood
you know because uh really you know if stuff was always the same that would get boring you know
stuff like star wars it has to evolve i know this because i haven't seen
the world you know if it happens to evolve in a way that you don't like it
you know that's probably just because you you cling onto your childhood way too no no no kleons
are star trek this is different much and you're just kind of stuck living in the past but anyways
guys there's a little side anyway guys anyways guys what is that number five now i think so
this could be the real what the wolf i think in the 11 minutes here he's managed to talk about
the force awakens for about 45 seconds how long do you think he's going to talk about having friends
and oh fuck i yeah star wars maybe maybe that video will be the force awakens force awakens
if i had to rate this movie i'd probably give it a solid eight out of ten so anyways guys thanks
for watching anyways guys also six times um the ending is really awesome you haven't seen the
ending you know what i'm talking about if you've seen it you know if you haven't seen it you know
what i'm talking about actually caught himself talking about uh luke skywalker plays a very
short role and trust me when i tell you that he didn't have to study his lines very hard because
he's not going to say anything thanks for telling us that we're gonna love it
oh man yeah just change it back to green that icon to green and it won't amplify it oh oh that
was great i think i felt like i was there in the theater he's up 20 subs since this started
he's got a footer where the fuck did this all came from
oh now we gotta watch his friends video um like how are we gonna find out how jared makes friends
so i'll i'll i'll i'll just take the sec to acknowledge the super chat we got um has anyone
relevant rewritten tfa or the last jedi yet which yeah i don't think that's ever gonna happen i'm
afraid uh malin kaisner top 10 anime crossovers love all you guys's stuff that was from party el cv uh
thank you jared for youtube rewind 2018
please be actually tinned up that would be fantastic um oh geez uh have you guys played
kotol 102 which is better i haven't played neither i i've played one but it was so long ago i uh i
wouldn't take uh much of my opinion into consideration it was ages ago yeah last time i played the first
one was when i was a little kid yeah same here and i don't even know if i finished that so i
don't remember anything about it aside from what caden from mass effect isn't it all i know is that
everyone says they're amazing i heard a lot of criticism about the second one if you don't like
it then you're just living in the past everybody wants me to play them though everyone's like you
must play them i'll get around to it eventually i do promise uh i think jar has been eating one of
too many yo-yos recently from hudson uh ten dollars for each string on that pole bass guitar
in the back does he actually already have one string on it uh from the rookie critic hey guys
made a youtuber appreciation vid on rags we'll be doing one for wolfen more the next month
and then top hat is next and why the fuck is he shirtless um thanks for uh he doesn't need a shirt
he's beyond shirts i was gonna say i don't know why he's choosing to be shirtless it's not i don't
know if he thinks that's like do you think he thinks it's a good thing i think i think here genesis
does have like a rag he has rags video at least one oh i saw one oh yeah yeah i was i was just
saying that uh i don't i don't know if he thinks it benefits him to be shirtless like it has some
kind of it adds to the effect there's like seasons of jar genesis this is the way he takes his shirt
off like we're waiting for it to come back uh this i want you to understand that i i i i'm gonna i'm
gonna post another picture and this is the video and i want you i want you to look at this this is
i thought that was a screen though that that is the thumbnail for his video called watching rags
expose me wait hang on this is one month ago is that about one of the podcasts or is that someone
else i don't know um do you reckon we should watch that one maybe yeah we can do that
you should just only watch Jared Genesis videos
Jared Genesis Friday or something uh this this money is for Jared to replenish his yo-yo supply
from Christopher McClure i'm sorry i have to donate this whole stream is too majestic oh my god
oh my god yeah i don't know this man is he's there's there's no compliments down there you
gotta upvote it we gotta keep him alive uh the part of Kyla would now be played by Shapiro
10 dollars for each anyway guys he actually donated 60 dollars oh wow thanks thanks very
much uh i've seen Jared Genesis nipples now despite that that being your fault here is buddy thanks i
guess um yeah thank you all very much especially for the people who are donating 100 and up and
stuff it's like all for Jared Genesis response videos that's uh i'm impressed that's more than
he makes it a decade but uh yeah thank you a lot i was gonna say i don't know did you know if you
wanted guys wanted to like bookmark the other videos with Jared videos maybe like we go to a
normal one and then back to Jared okay yeah yeah that makes sense that makes sense yeah we can do
so we got a choice of captain midnight um game maker's toolkit uh downward thrust
and um who's the other one oh yeah clean price gaming there are four so obviously
uh let me see man they're all so awful they're so awful uh let's do the secret of mario no let's
do the playstation four is not so problematic problem i was i was actually curious to see what
um if there's a consensus in chat or not we got down with thrust and then what did captain
midnight do yeah he's he's relatively appreciated but i i'm i'm one of the people who doesn't like
his channel just because he's um he does the same thing as down with us by the way
watch the shortest one whatever one will get us closer to another gym
um i want to make a whole podcast where it's just Jared videos let's one episode of the podcast
only has to be Jared we'll go it down with thrust and this is gonna be a you know let's be nice
let's see if he really does highlight a prob way a not so problematic problem in the playstation
four that is that is the title of this for anybody who's curious it's only eight minutes there you go
we can get back to Jared soon enough dude what i've got i've got over zoom so what it plays
videos when i hover over things temporarily and i hover over this is playing the Jared video
you can see it on my stream that's brilliant okay are we ready folks yes here we go as a long time
oh my god i've grown up on so right jesus and microsoft somewhere along the lines though
most people i still have the uh yeah yeah the audio extension up yeah switch it to green yeah
i think what happened with mine was the control is like bugs in the you know the lowest option
that's my highest and then the next one is lowest so it makes like the highest one it's just i don't
know it's fucked maybe i need to reboot chrome but i can't be able to do that right now but anyway
let's let's hear that one destroyed my eardrums
as a long time gamer i've grown up on sony nintendo and microsoft is that him is that his
name tone luke yes well that that's the name he puts out there but you know no one has the
name tone luke so that's so fucking awful yeah if you have a bit of some kind of character
isn't tone not a name but an actual like thing like tone it's i don't know skin tone he's got to
make sure he's watching the skin tone a dollar shave club ad get woke he didn't even capitalize
somewhere along the lines though most people just a stylistic choice rags platform i imagine by
necessity of course money doesn't grow on trees after all others become devote just comes from
trees yeah it's cotton comes from the cotton fields comes from the blacks that's right
uh the molar channel does not necessarily reflect the opinions of both rags and the dos on board
yes it does yes it does yes it does you're friends with us that makes you race
oh as if i'd even need that when i made the black panther video my
my if you didn't like black panther your fate's already sealed i was done everyone hated me from
then on particular brand because they like what it stands oh someone's saying i need to make
discord emotes so just share it speaking for or what exclusive games are on offer the power of it
price of it or just what it can do oh my god the gamer isn't the cheapest hobby getting operational
with a new console a few games and accessories will run you over 500 bucks usually and keeping
up with new games as they come out will steadily drain your wallet then considering the amount of
pre-order items dlc in-game monetization and subscription-based applications such as playstation
plus or xbox lives right so far and it adds up to you yeah like nobody's going to disagree
i'm wondering if is this going to be the actual problem that it costs money to play games because
yeah we'll see where it goes it's like this turns into a capitalism rant or something
even more it's hard to give up that kind of expenditure especially when your gaming library
for a particular console gets larger watch last guardian gameplay makes me angry the game is just
terrible everything about it is bad i am a major die-hard fan of shadow the colossus and the last
guardian was disappointing i was so excited when that game actually turned out to become
and then i played it and i was like it's bad at least the hyena bird's cute i wanted to like it
okay yeah yeah it's cute when it actually does what you need it to do have you heard the justification
for that watch they're like the the thing disobeys regularly because it's supposed to create the idea
that it's kind of like playing with an actual animal yeah the only problem is that it's really
fucking annoying i was just like that doesn't translate to mechanics because you're just sitting
there like is my game broken is my game broken yeah i mean come on i mean there's a scripted
event where you have to jump off a building and it's supposed to catch you in half the time it'll
just stare at you as you fall into an abyss like fuck this guy i hope i hope he likes me this
playthrough that's uh yeah that definitely happens on it god this game is so terrible
i can't believe people made that that stupid like if you make that kind of excuse just stop
pretending you're smart what if it's the developers who said that okay well the developers should
stop making games them it's not that our game's broken it's just that the animal doesn't like your
face that's all it is despite us all being on the same side at the end of the road
i don't agree with that there's a fucking vile ass console fan boys out there man i just i just
love it like fucking hate our guts i love dancing these like ultimately we all agree and rags like
i disagree with that oh there's some vile ass motherfuckers out there who want you to suffer
because you didn't buy the right corporation game box oh yes jesus christ you didn't buy that ps4
2.3 so fuck you i hope no games come out and i hope your mother drowns
it's not even being hyperbolic that is the kind of shit that it's like it's like jokes on you
she already drowned yeah jokes how do you know that name we are so segregated in this 82 billion
dollar world video markets that was poorly what does he mean segregated what what
blacks and whites you know playstation is black and xbox is white what just curious is he saying
this like we segregate across xbox to ps4 i guess that must be what he's saying i suppose but it's
self-segregation so it's okay right because that's like saying you're segregated by choosing to go to
the gym instead of swimming or something you're like you're segregating yourself between the
people at mcdonald's and you at the gym because you each made your choice and the people at the
gym chose wrong that's simple i don't know he's probably just trying to make it sound a bit more
doom and gloom in there i get i know that no i can't no from from tone look come on
oh
no these super edges like no it's
yeah it's japanese
oh
yeah like a metaphor way it's it's those the mascots versus each other because of
their system sellers and yeah because of how sad people are it's like master chief's better than
me because dude there was um there's this there's a website that's still going today called true
achievements which took your xbox 360 like achievement score and points and it would
aggregatedly take the amount of people who've played the game versus got the achievement to
build you a new score and so the idea is if nine people had played well ten people played the game
and only one person got the achievement then its score gets times by like 10 or whatever so you
get like a reimagined game of score based on how difficult the achievements were and they did this
virgin meter yeah they they did um they did this special but they were like okay we're gonna have
mascots from all different uh kinds of gaming areas and you can vote on who would win in a fight
and um you know etsyo from assassin's creed this was like the height of assassin's creed's
fame with with that character he ends up like winning the entire thing he beat out master chief
and um you know the main character from prototype he beats him in a fight apparently
exactly i was like yo i don't necessarily give a shit but like really you're gonna say that
it's like don't get me wrong i love etsyo as a character but you know it's just like an assault
rifle is an assault rifle man i don't know what to tell you imagine putting him up against profit
from crisis where you go invisible and enhance his armor and like throw you off a roof from
a hundred miles away have you guys played prototype like the character is like
a morphing series of tentacles that can do anything i know i know about him yeah it's
like nobody's gonna be he's like he can be shot and survive it's like i think you're fucked
so wars microsoft versus sony versus nintendo kratos versus the master chief
it's all a big game to get you to pledge loyalty to a brand loyalty brand i'm sorry
and people do it that's the thing that's just so crazy that people do that shit and they it's like
a mark of pride because they've attached themselves to a corporation and i was gonna say what else
it's not like they have a choice you know if you brand your own company you one of the first things
you want to do if you're running a console is we need exclusives otherwise we're we're dead in the
water if if one of sony or shame that that's how it has to be yeah i don't think it has to be that
but that's just what people expect that's what that's what companies do and then well let's put
it this way if uh there were no exclusives then you'd only buy one of the machines wouldn't you
because you'd be like i can get all these on one so it's one of the best machine in terms of hardware
it would it would be about hardware price and services which is like that yeah and so i don't
know i don't know if you can have a world i mean technically speaking perfect will to me is that we
all evolved to the point where consoles aren't needed anymore and you just have like pcs with
i don't know maybe it may be a marketable mainline pc that's just uh essentially a console but pc
parts and you can you just buy like little boxes that are mini pcs i mean they're out there that's
what the steam the steam did that right they released well there is some tech doesn't steams
got some out there it's just a matter of getting them in the public square and most people it's
it's not like a tech thing it's just they just think console they just think xbox playstation
nintendo that's that's just how they think and let's be honest like all three of us own
uh a console outside of the pc right like we own yeah i don't play it but i've got it well i've
got my ps4 in prep for when there's something on ps4 i really want to play that i can't on pc so
they they got me you know because i want to play the exclusives it's just i don't know it
seems like the only thing you can do uh if you're going to be running a business in this position
double the amount of its most pertinent competition the xbox one the console has
totaled somewhere in the realm of 75 million sales i like how he says it's most pertinent
competition with the xbox is like i'm confused like what are the three lines i guess it's sales
ps4 versus xbox versus switch which is which i'm assuming is the color code i'm assuming i'm
assuming that the blue is playstation 4 green is xbox and then i guess white wasn't a good color
for switch so we just went with red yeah i hope i hope that's the actual because otherwise doesn't
be confusing yeah i suppose so compared to that of 35 from xbox you can ignore the red line here
which represents the nintendo switch that console has only been oh yeah two years okay most of this
success can be attributed to more exclusive video games and a better start during the man that
camera oh shit jesus and no offense but like he hasn't said anything uh that everyone doesn't
know yet he's basically said there are there are people here he's basically said there are console
fanboys yeah and it's it's off and down to exclusives yeah there are corporate slaves yes there are
the xbox one kind of stumbled early with its mixed messaging regarding used video games
non-optional connect hardware integration and its high retail price of five hundred dollars
it wasn't until microsoft started selling 400 versions of the xbox one without the connect
i like in june of 2004 like this relevant footage yeah it's our i think it's is it neo the actual
oh stocks little demon soul maybe i don't think it's toxins is it what is it it's someone in
chapel this isn't bloodborne either this looks like some my guess is neo but it could not be
that as well someone in chat inform what is this game that is similar to dark souls
securo oh it wouldn't be that i don't think so dark souls of dark souls shit you're right
yeah a couple people say neo neo okay so today the playstation isn't a really good spot
well it's got a ways to go to becoming a top five selling console of all time i like how you just
decided to put the playstation down the list this is such an unappealing looking image i know
why did he i know he you don't need to highlight to put an arrow if you really need people who
can't read ps4 you could have just snipped out the playstation blurred out everything else
enlarged it a little bit well and made that clear what i would have done is i would have
just gone up to because they're already in boxes all you have to do is just use the box box tool
on paint make it red and just have it cover that row and just highlight that whole row
in a red box like the rags has the paint solution that's how low this goes you could get a paint
solution well it's like you just click it it's it's so fucking easy it's so quick and easy i
mean i made videos on movie maker and so like four videos ago so that's my mindset is these
relative sales figures do prove that it has done a good job so far and most people would consider
the playstation 4 to be one of the better con uh by two minutes some people think that i'm sure
some people think that we go we got two two minutes and 20 seconds of nothing still i'm still
waiting for something that he says that i go oh you know just some of the big wakes me up you can
do it dude like uh consoles to have ever been made still one would hope that the success of the
playstation would not stop anytime soon as we all want more awesome exclusive games like you just
said that it's bad that we have brand loyalty thanks to mascots and now he's saying that we
all want it to continue because we want more exclusives can't we just get good games why do
we need good exclusives yeah i know i wouldn't i wouldn't say i'm actually i would even so i own a
ps ps4 i would actually say i don't want it to continue with shoving so many good games onto
exclusives because i have to fucking spend more money you know like you think i'm relishing the
idea that i have to buy a switch to play super smash brothers like that's the thing like i only
play on pc but if a game can be on console without it compromising the integrity of the game then
yeah put it there more people the better better for the developers better for more gamers put it
out there let people play it i mean i'd like to have all the god of war games on pc so then i can
actually play it without having to like rent a fucking uh stream copy of the first god of war
in order to play it 31 fps that's that the game stalls all the time that is a legit like ongoing
thing for pc how do we find ways of playing games that are exclusive it's like that's just the
never-ending problem that people have emulators basically like 10 years behind at all times and
there even though i think they've got the switch emulators working now actually from what i've seen
i heard it's pretty good i know they got it working for like breath of the wild and stuff
and i heard it was pretty crazy i don't have to try an emulator to see if i can get oh and um
the original god of wars or at least everything before god of war three to clarify for the
audience this video is called the playstation 4's not so problematic problem no i do not know how
any of this relates but we're probably going to find out let's hope we might live it at e3 this
year i'm not so sure that sony is in the position to sell a huge more amount of the playstation 4
much a huge more amount damn son i'm putting that by note that mastery a huge more amount man that's
of consoles is most likely going to hit in 2019 how do you people play these fucking games at
these frame rates how do you people do it oh my god i i what are you talking about 30 fps yeah
yeah it's like if you know we're 30 fps best case scenario with these games i'm watching the screen
and i'm going how do you people so you're telling me that you want to double the frames you want to
have that much of a huge more frames you know i actually like there's people that tell me like
oh there's no effect with having 60 fps it doesn't change anything it's like you
you've literally never you've never played anything yeah all i will say is that if it's
a consistent stat of 30 fps i can get used to it i'm not happy with it i can get used to it but
to say that it's no different than 60 i'm just like i already know that you would say it's
different if you could have them both right in front of you yeah i mean i i like horizon zero don
but it's like this game would be so much better on pc if i could run it at 1080p 60 fps but wolf
it's more cinematic all right because guys films are in 24 fps you're lucky to get 30
16 or 2020 yeah because i'm moving in a video game with this uh you watch them both don't you
at best so not too far down the road knowing this there is much hesitation in buying a
playstation 4 right now especially because the pro is kind of in a janky position 4k
TVs are common but they're not too common and even still um dude how did he just say that
instead of going oh what i meant sorry what i meant to say was
what i'm doing right now is just like taking notes of the funniest things he says because
they're just going to be in my april fools video this wigs they're right they're not too common
maybe we heard that wrong let's scoot back a little bit no we didn't
are common but they're not too common you can still
be at four pro games running at a native how do you say that line and not immediate oh maybe i
should yeah it's it's about emphasis like they're common but they're not too common i mean that still
doesn't mean anything but you kind of know yeah no it's all down to inflection he said uh they're
common but they're not covered it wasn't that's how it sounds to the audience not too common
it's like he emphasizes words that don't need to be emphasized but then when he this he doesn't
emphasize the correct words and then it doesn't sound it just sounds like a total contradiction
he needs to know which words to put huge more emphasis on
you
it's more build-up baggage quotes all right so let's see all right yeah we're only at 30 frames
per second so to those on the pc crowd looking to get into consoles and maybe buy a playstation
4 pro it's kind of a tough sell so how do you ask people who want to buy a console now to buy a
playstation 4 pro knowing that the playstation 5 is probably not that far off that's one joke in
the wrench for sony right now even though the playstation 4 is did you say kick in the wrench
oh let me let me check i've never heard that expression not that far off that's one kink in
the wrench for something right king kink in the wrench is that a phrase i never heard that
a kink in the wrench i just want to have a look if that's actually a thing
i've never heard that one before throw another kink in the wrench yeah apparently that's a thing
yeah throw a kink in the wrench it's a malifor it's it's a mash-up of throw a monkey wrench in the
works and iron out the kinks huh well fair enough i was gonna say that's way too weird for
him to have made up well it's it the thing is this called a malifor which is an unintentional
blended idiom oh and that's the only link that i could find for it so he unintentionally said
something that might be correct no he said it he said it wrong but because enough people say it
wrong this one website shows it as a thing that people say that's wrong so so it's like um
what's that saying that um oh yeah i could kls america screwed that one up
it's supposed to be i couldn't kls but you guys started saying i could kls so much that it caught
on was that an was that an american thing i'm almost certain it's an american thing
because the british people say i couldn't kls it's like how we changed twat to twat
yeah but the thing is i think that's an accent thing because like i my accent sounds right when
i say twat but you guys saying twat sounds a bit wrong because you go twat like sort of thing
because this is so twat comes out american it's like i think that's how that happened anyway
i guess i don't know i think that i think that just the difference between
couldn't and could and couldn't i think a lot of people just oh i'm not i'm not saying i actually
have anything to cite for you like why it's an american visitor british thing it's just that
i never hear it over in britain but i hear it all the time um from americans and there's
actually a video from david mitchell on youtube complaining about it and i'm pretty sure he said
that americans are to blame because if we could uh if we pulled that up it would i totally would
explain it don't worry i'm not blaming you guys you guys are great present companies that is the
case no there's there's a lot of americans fucking can't speak english worth of shit
um you just hate america yeah mauler why do you hate americans how do you know i'm not american
that's true i don't let me this here and now even though the playstation 4 is amazing and
it's doing incredibly well so you could say it's a nice problem but remember this is a video called
the problem with the ps4 but it's not a problem quotes yeah it's not a problem i guess i don't
know the video's always halfway done are we assuming then that the problem is that it's hard
to sell to people who don't like 30 fps but it's not really a problem because it's selling well
is that the point of his video um i guess we'll find out a problem nonetheless from a business
perspective one thing that games companies do to accelerate sales towards the end phase
of a console lifecycle is by ramping up exclusive video game development didn't didn't we already
cover that exclusives sort of we yeah he touched on him he said ramping them up let's see what he
means by that as we've seen with god of war yakuza 6 the remaster of shadow of colossus and the
upcoming games like detroit become human and of course the last of us part 2 it's clear that sony
does understand the need to get your attention right now it launched with bloodborne that's like
the the exclusive for ps4 that people reference right like they're like you should uh i don't know
it was it was so many years ago that's the thing well this is all exclusive because his argument
is that there's more exclusives as time goes on which isn't necessarily untrue because of
frequencies like that's gonna happen but how often they're released i don't think it's
from my knowledge i don't think it really changed did it
i i don't know about frequency um i know that like the xbox always gets called out a lot for
not having games um i don't really keep i off the top of my head i don't really keep up that much
though i think the playstation the playstation does definitely have more exclusives way more
but i i don't know about when they did come out in the frequency of the times they came out
yeah i mean i'll you know what i'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and say you know
what maybe you're right maybe they do ramp up their exclusives as as the time as time goes on
to try and get more people to buy it i yeah sure whatever and they have sure been given a gift by
our old buddies microsoft the xbox one team hasn't really done too much to compete with sony lately
in terms of giving us great games that you can't get anywhere else than on the xbox one what this
makes me think okay but didn't he just talk about in the beginning of the video about how it's bad
that that's a thing that happens anyway you know maybe he's trying to like maybe he's
rags.exe is still working don't try to break this down in any other theory but jared because team
hasn't really done too much to compete with sony lately in terms of giving us great games
that you can't get anywhere else than on the xbox one this makes me think that they are
the other thing he's just brazenly ran over is like so there are no good exclusives like i'm
sure there's some people who think gia's world four is good right oh yeah i heard i heard a guy
give reviews and i don't know enough about the exclusives on xbox one but just like are they
all bad really and then like i said this is a point that he had against the console conflict
at the beginning but now it's a bad thing that it doesn't have good exclusives like
all right i wish he'd just get to the point dude what it's called the not so problematic
problem i don't think we're going to get a clear answer what else going on
missing on getting the next xbox out before the playstation five especially since they know that
they've already lost this generation of hardware at least in terms of sales microsoft will continue
to support the xbox one for a long time and put out the occasional exclusive game in the process
but sony is doing a much better job not just in terms of putting out games but putting out
good games okay i'm glad you could just that's just true okay thanks all right low five
recor and a few other games released last year there's really not much out there for the xbox
one right now okay uncharted horizon zero dawn neo the last guardian some of these games made sure
the last nordia is a very bad example
i heard that was pretty mixed it was not a good game what the fuck game is this this is uncharted
for oh this is this is like really early on in the game oh i've never played uncharted it just
looks like another third base third person cover based action which yeah that's you know i i love
how he just he's just brushes you know the whole like this is just my opinion then he says like ps4
is destroying xbox for exclusive games that are actually of quality it's just like you don't want
to like prove any of it you don't want to qualify any of this it's like just boom boom boom they're
all good they are these are all bad it's like all right this is such a weird clip to use from
uncharted four i know you could have chosen one of the action clips we like the dory bit where you
can see drake's face at the very least you'd be like oh there he is no i was at the very least
like show the gameplay not like for the gunplay not just like i mean this in the water this was
all about weird choice so in addition to this being a year dominated by sony exclusives that
trend is well represented in the past as well but are there a no i don't know about that wasn't the
360 euro versus ps3 i'm pretty sure the 361 like overall yeah absolutely and i'm not going to say
it's because they had better exclusives i'm just saying that i'm pretty sure that it wasn't always
ps3 had the best uh shit going on in fact the exclusives for xbox 360 we're talking about
gears of war two which was i loved that game then you got halo three which let's be honest
that's adored system seller um this is kind of testing my memory i'm trying to think of like what
else was exclusive for 360 i'm sure the chat will know there's got to be a um red dead redemption
was that i think mass effect one was initially red dead redemption halo reach as well yeah called
there weren't exclusives but the call of duties really sold people well on it um crack down gears
of war um let me see the halo stuff didn't uh mass effect one initially come out as a xbox
the exclusive or am i thinking of the wrong game it's very possible i'm not sure
was forza is for is forza and was bio shock originally no bio shock was on ps3 i'm sure of
that unless it got released later it might have initially been a room what about left for dead
well that was definitely on pc yeah but maybe comparing consoles maybe yeah i can't remember
but yeah point being is that um we can't even prove the statement and he's just said it's true
it is like could at least oh yeah fable fable people love fable yeah fable the first one was
good um the now mass effect eventually came out on playstation uh oh dead rising oh yeah oh yeah
i think the first saint's row was only on xbox
xbox maybe at first on all the saints row oh if we're talking about ps3 versus 360
well the first one maybe i i can't remember but uh yeah fable was definitely uh popular as well
so and yeah red dead was on police station three but um oh blue dragon blood dragon
blood dragon blue dragon blue dragon i never played it but i heard it was really really good
um yeah like i said either way is their exclusives that were strong on the 360 because
i think halo three is enough you know i think just halo three but the thing is one thing about
the xbox is that it was really big like we're online stuff it was yeah no they nailed it really
big with call of duty and halo and of the shooter if you remember doodrow shooters all that playstation
three took like two years to implement like a really good party chat system like they didn't
like they didn't have it i don't think that i don't think playstation three ever had
cross cross games chat or party chat yeah while 360 was like memory just so much better for that
department oh yeah absolutely yeah if you wanted it online like it was hands down if you wanted
the best online experience you definitely bought an xbox 360 yeah if you weren't on pc you were
playing on xbox sorry downward thrust we're uh we're taking off intended we're saying
buy a playstation for that sorry at all gamers who do not have a console that's honestly do you
like the cutting between random ps4 games just because why not it's just like you know yeah it's
like keep with the same game so i can fucking see what he does with the goddamn box so you're like
concerned with he has like show me some like show me something interesting like whenever whenever i
start a video and i've got the message playing i'm like choose like a little interesting clip
people might want to see where you're wrecking the enemy team or something funny happens what
you know something interesting to look at my question becomes like if you're going to talk
about statistics in any way shape or form why don't you show some sales figures why not show
some articles that say what you're saying instead of just yeah here's uncharted i guess why not and
you can put nowadays i can do i couldn't do this in movie make but i know in vegas i'm like i could
have like a game i could just sit down and jerk around in grand theft auto for 30 minutes hit a
button save the last 30 minutes and then that could just be playing and whenever i wanted to put a
graph or something over it that was relevant to what i was saying i was like oh i said this put
the graph here you could put a huge more effort into these videos you could put a huge huge more
titanic mini efforts interested in the upcoming playstation 4 exclusives but if you like single
player games like god of war and the last of us i think there's enough to get people to jump on
board time will i mean i guess if it's several a lot you know but that's the thing he's really
not saying anything it's like yeah yeah non-committal statement some people might jump to the ps4
because of his exclusives you're like sure yeah sure individual yeah i guess yeah i mean that's
why that's the main reason people buy the consoles they buy is just for the exclusives
and that's the shame but that's how it is right now those do just that the giants used to gather
here to trade what does this have anything to do with what you just said this is dude this is fast
becoming one of my favorite memes with the essay people they just play a cutscene thing that just
doesn't matter it has absolutely nothing to do it i'll just throw a random glimpse your way it's
it can jump anything from overwatch to seven days to die it's a fucking anything
just read it here quick random clip since the launch of the playstation 4 there haven't been
a lot of price cuts launching at 400 there has only been one official price dump from sony that
being the drop to 350 to the base ps4 made in october of 2015 okay you might pick it up for a
few bucks cheaper here and there depending on what version punches in the script object smackers
it's punching wood he literally cut to god of war punched nothing walked forward and i was walking
back it's like did you even look at your footage dude is what you're gonna throw down for the
console the xbox one also yeah i got a fucking weight kid i have to make a video about the
playstation currently runs 350 dollars okay this asian guy's expression is exactly what everyone
who just watched that part of the video should be looking what am i supposed to be looking at
something oh that's brilliant has made the console secret to buy over time relatively speaking four
years ago the average wage in america was a few percent lower than it is today just walking around
with my baby the same job since then you've most likely got a small raise every year increasing
your income by hopefully the amounts of yearly inflation that's kind of how the system works
okay for some strange reason the video game industry is unaffected by inflation and prices
do not rise year over year um what the fuck okay down with the rest what what the fuck is the
playstation 4 it's not a problematic problem not just that but dude to say that games don't cost
more oh by the way we do have you know microtransactions dlc just loads those are different
types of gouging while maintaining the same base price as jim still in i think coined it
instead of saying the base game now we should say the shell price as in you buy the game and then
you buy all the stuff later that has to fill the game up because it's not actually a full game
while it used to be a full game it's just like to pretend like none of that has happened it's like
yeah okay yeah the games totally haven't been hit by inflation in any way shape or form it's not
like they're trying to make more money and sell you the same thing but for more i would love to
ask all the people who thumbed up this video what they liked about it so much
is the main reason why the dlc market the free to play oh pre-order bonuses and the end game store
were created to make additional weird bizarre footage to start using i take it back he did at
least mention it i take it back money for game publishers in order to offset this rising cost
of doing business via inflation so combine that information with the fact that the ps4 is now
cheaper and that game prices have remained constant the playstation 4 is cheaper to buy
with today's currency than it was at any point during its life cycle oh my god well yes if you
look back that that crash bandicoot gameplay was from the part in uncharted 4 where you
play crash bandicoot because you could see the tv that was in the game he didn't why was he shot
because it's a different game inflation i want to see that it's a different game within the game
he didn't just go that played the actual crash bandicoot he just he just played uncharted 4 he
got to the part play crash bandicoot in uncharted 4 i accidentally had jared genesis pop up against
my hoversu but um yeah that's a very i was gonna ask why he had like a reduced emulation of it on
screen that was a strange choice but yeah you're right it's actually in in in uncharted i guess
which is okay you do you that's another strange um there you go i don't have to say yeah people
in the chatter like what the hell was that when jared popped up sudden jared jared sneaking a peek
jared jumpscare he comes literally if you guys look at the stream he comes right above our heads
someone's like jared you silly goat and the ps4 is now cheaper and that game prices have remained
constant the playstation 4 is cheaper to buy with today's currency than it was at any point during
its life cycle but the yeah that's what happens he makes a point he makes a point that it goes
from 400 to 350 then he says and so it's now cheaper to buy it than any other point in this
life cycle i'm confused by that yeah isn't that just two plus two equals four i want to say that
he's not really saying something that's blindingly obvious so i don't understand how it wouldn't be
that yeah you're right yeah that's what yeah that's what happens to things they get cheaper
generally especially after a price cut that you just mentioned entry fee as such for a new i'm
sorry someone in the chat said jared is jared is in his natural habitat belonging nowhere
jared jumpscare but the entry fee as such for a new console as an outsider is still incredibly
high regardless people just don't have a lot of disposable income especially when you consider
the average age of gamers has been steadily going down since what the boom of the freedom
has it not been steadily going up and he just mentioned free to play free to play it's free
to play one it's like 31 years now is like the average age i mean isn't the whole thing like
old boomers are like only children play video games yeah well you have generations in 30s and
40s that used to play the nests and stuff so yeah the average age of gamers i think is like
30 is like 30s it's in the 30s i think well because he's referencing stuff like fortnite
and mobas which yeah they got like a huge boost from kids because kids didn't have to buy them
they could play them for free as he just said he was like yeah there's a lot in free to play and
it's like so your point about how it's getting harder to pay for them because the audiences
are going down in age and then you reference that the most commonly played games from
kids are free to play i just do you not understand your own point but they would have the console
anyway it's like but but even if the average age goes down if they are a game player then
they have purchased the game anyway to get into the pool of the average age i don't know exactly
what is it's so anyway yeah a few years ago and when you consider the socio-political climate
today that point gets nailed in even stronger what the united states brings in the highest revenue
of any country colony or territory for the video game industry in the world okay i wonder if there's
a reason for that is it because the majority of developers are american rather than any other
creed because america is enormous could that be a lot of people in america
the average wages in america are pretty high people can afford to play video games i
creation though there has been a great deal of litigation and tax oppression towards the lower
and middle class groups of our society which has driven people to be more financially conservative
when was this video made 2016 top 100 video game revenues as well
i i'm gonna check and see when this video was made because uh let's see downward thrust
he just referenced trump so it must have gone too long ago so let's see um
downward this feels like it could be a topic for a whole video what he just said though
like what is this point that the united states makes the most money therefore
people buy games more in america i don't even know because his original his initial point was
that people are buying games less because the demographic is getting lower and lower meaning
kids don't have money to spend and then he's like but also when you consider this it nails it in the
coffin the united states makes united states the united states makes the most money from
video game revenue i'm like how does this tie in with anything so so this video was made in
april of 2018 this is after trump's tax cuts his his uh his information here is from 2016 though
but why would that's been two years
i don't know i don't even know what point he's making we should probably at least see what he
says because i don't even i'm so confused yeah it's weird because i because because i just google
like trump tax cuts i was looking through it was like two days ago the hill american consumers
feel better than ever thanks to the tax cuts um tax cut tax cut for double blah it's just
i don't understand i'm very confused i think jared's videos make more sense than this
i think so because like there are more and more and more and more gamers like like the pool of
people who are playing video games is getting bigger and bigger also just to take one second
to remind everyone the video's title the playstation 4 is not so problematic problem
someone in the chat said jared would understand
he'd see right through this bullshit this amount of disposable income in the first place buying a
playstation 4 pro isn't exactly in the cards for a lot of people especially when you yeah but
remember that the pro is something that is was optional and well but what i'm trying to say is
that what you still have the base ps4 just because they might not want to buy a ps4 pro
right and it was normally said if the the pro isn't going to convince people who already own
a ps4 to maybe buy one but maybe it could convince some people who are looking at a
playstation to get one not to mention he met he talks about free to play again kids don't
necessarily they play in fortnite right now that's the newest craze isn't it it's demographic is
very uh on average low age group you you've seen the videos where like kids doing the dances from
fortnite and they look like five year old sort of thing it's just like fucking hell um so i don't
see all this has to do with ps4 exactly look how you could actually make an interesting topic out
of this you could look at the age demographics for the ps4 and then the overall earnings for
those demographics in america on average and then the prices and just see see what you can see from
that but instead he's just like america makes a lot of money but kids don't yeah you you could
say i mean it's an interesting thing to talk about if you were to say things like you know
what is the sudden shift in demographics mean like what what is fortnite done to bring in a bunch
of kids who might not have necessarily been gamers but bring them into the industry you
know because it essentially it's acting as a um my like a gateway kind of game it's free you can
jump into it you can play and now they're on the machine they want to play other games eventually
so they'll buy new ones or maybe they would might not have bought them before you know how
what are the numbers on that how many of them are there i mean that's an interesting thing
to consider a lot of people have been saying by the way that apparently in jared's newest video
he talks about how you would never go on podcast uh well maybe we can change that because we got him
the amount of he's uh this is his last jedi video is his first reach 1000
it's because of us really man that's amazing jared we will promote you
if you allow us to have your company that is our deal jared it's been four weeks without your
content i don't know what to do with myself without your videos please come back also i wasn't i
wasn't saying the uh fortnite play as a kids i'm saying that as far as i know uh a lot of kids play
fortnite i'm sure fortnite wasn't directed uh created for children i'm sure they had teens
in mind or maybe up but uh yeah i don't know this video is so confusing this clearly has a yeah he's
gonna have a summary i'm rather excited you consider they can get their gaming kicks for free
on an iphone okay there's so iphones aren't free though so the thing is you're just you're just
swapping the iphone for the playstation yeah but the games are free on there you can't get
free to play games on the playstation except uh fortnite and wait is fortnite free on the playstation
i don't know it is on pc right stuff like warframe and all that yeah um can you get
mobas on playstation probably not i don't know i don't know the point is that we have a minute
and 10 seconds left and he hasn't told us what the fuck he's talking about yeah apparently it
is free yeah so it'll be i have no idea what he's talking about here we go just a minute and 10
seconds until we can finally get back oh oh oh oh oh he said the word problem but here we go
does sony have a problem trying to get people to buy the current version of their playstation 4 pro
knowing that money is tight and people are growing averse to the idea of spending
supplementary income on a hobby that they could otherwise get free especially i love the way
weird but do you cast a very sweet otherwise so ultimately sony's problem is that they made
an alternative playstation and it and maybe some it's going to be hard to convince people to buy
it well i don't understand how this is playstation 4's problem when there's new versions of the xbox
coming out as well that they release uh so it's their problem too um and yeah like he's
highlighted that money isn't isn't something everyone has and it's like so when was this not
the case why is this a playstation 4's problem you remember there was different versions of the
playstation 2 it's not like everyone had money once upon a time and now we don't yeah why isn't
the title of this video like will the playstation 4 because he he talked about bullshit for seven
and a half minutes and it's just the most vapid nonsense you could ever imagine that everybody
already knows is these most non-committal random video game footage mockery of a video production
and it's just then at the very very end he's like oh but maybe they can't sell as many pros as they
thought well i guess he's going to provide the alternative argument now right because he's just
said like how are they going to sell this when everyone's got such little amounts of money and
it's kind of the same thing this video this video could have been like a minute and 30 seconds
actually since they don't know how long the playstation 4 is going to be in circulation
with the ps5 dodge coming around in a couple years i don't know but what i do know is that sony
has done a great job with the playstation 4 and it's a great system to have thanks for the insight
if you can afford it or not it's a great system to have whether you can afford it or not okay
how does this do much good for the people who can't afford it is it and that doesn't help this
video at all i don't understand oh my god it hits my brain i never know what he's trying to say
i don't know but what i do know is that sony has done a great job with the playstation 4 and
it's a great system to have regardless if you can afford it or not and regardless
if you think it's not going to be a worthy investment for the playstation 5's
looming ascension just around the corner is it you've asserted that it's around the corner
what do you mean next year two years and what's the what was the point what's the problem
i don't even know i i think the problem is very problematic they're releasing new
visions of the console and they can't really he didn't even say they can't sell them he just said
are people gonna buy them but the sales keep going up the people keep buying
people just keep buying the playstation 4 so that would jared jared thrust
for now i will turn it over to you guys to leave me your comments on the following question
of course you can leave it over should we wait should we wait on the the question is should we
wait on the ps4 that's what you get from this whole fucking video is five for the ps4 ps5
he's ending it like a chick track again should we wait on the ps5 um let me say something
video was about let me say something that's partially controversial it is very rare that
you'll actually have a youtuber who's invested in hearing what you're going to say they want you
to comment because it benefits their analytics they don't actually give a shit he doesn't care
if you're going to say yes i will wait on the ps5 or no i will not why would that even what
difference does that make to him like and how does that even come into play for what he's talked
about in this video how what part of this video benefits from people saying whether or not they'll
wait for the ps5 is such a bizarre conclusion the most common um comments are that it's clickbait
uh yeah i i would agree with that look at the title it makes you think oh is this something
about the ps4 i didn't know yeah i was like is there a problem it makes me think that the
playstation 4 is going to have like that like that plateau point where it's so successful it
can't get any more or where it outgrows the market or where um there's going to be a point
where all the studios aren't are are working on games and not releasing them or something
i would never have guessed in a million years that the question was should we wait on the ps5
it's like he made all of his points about how those exclusives
which makes you buy these consoles individually then he said the ps4 is just a great console
because the exclusives are really good compared to microsoft then he said they released pro versions
he didn't actually go into why you should or shouldn't buy the pro version by the way
which i wouldn't recommend it if you have a ps4 it's not good enough upgrade um and then he's
like should we wait on the ps5 it's like what have you told us that would help us decide that
and i don't get the whole i don't get the whole thing about people are pressed by higher taxes
now it's like that's just just fucking wrong i don't yeah i'm lost but uh should we see if he's
got uh promotions in you maybe maybe should people wait for the playstation 5 thanks for
watching guys i really appreciate it much love and we'll see you in our next video peace love
and happiness what a waste of my life all right yeah why didn't we just watch jared well i was
gonna say is what we got next is uh jared's response to regs right no wait what about his uh
his his friends video i i've just are you not interested in seeing him talk about i am like
interested in seeing what he has to say about me because i haven't really like yeah talked about
him in fucking ages yeah i want to know if he's talking about the podcast no this i don't think um
i doubt he's figured out that i've been watching him
should be too hard someone's gonna comment that disorder wolf said them here that he goes to your
channel that's it well yeah but he he probably knows now
he's got the fucking teenage mutant ninja tails
so let's unpack this
all right so he has used q-tips
is that a nail filer with spoil on top i think that's a is that a popsicle stick
oh my god why would you begin it that way he has his glasses he has a pair of scissors
he has yeah it's not even duct tape it's like thin black masking tape or something
he has a he has a crayon
that's a crayon is that a pink highlighter back there it's probably i think it was probably like
a pink pen or pink is that the handle for a screwdriver the red it might be
it looks like a small screwdriver he has so many just things but that's just the random
i've never seen so many q-tips on a desk before like they're used look man the yellow
he was just like i'm too fucking lazy to not even like throw it away but next time i get up take
them with me next time i can i mean you gotta understand well i'm glad that we i mean in the
last podcast i was like i wonder what his other wall look at least we're finally getting that
this is behind the scenes shit right here this magic happens what kind of disgusting green
shit you think is it that cup no the inside of the cup is green it's just fuel that's the thing
that's i because i remember from last video no and also notice how busted that cup is he's had
the cup for a while that cup's been through some shit a bunch of people have been saying it's like
oh one second in you've already got this like no this is zero seconds in zero we haven't had the
time to elapse this is the first frame this is the contents of his stolen safe so to all the
people that genuinely thought this guy is a troll oh my god okay all right all right let me uh
oh wait i can't see what you guys can see hang on oh that's that's closer yeah it looks like we're
out of sync but i can't i can't not show it on stream yeah you're just out of sync i can see his
eyes you can only see his forehead okay now you see what we're seeing
oh
why does it look like part of the door has been burned
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god german
three seconds
i don't fucking do it
okay i haven't hit him say a word rags did you have to all right yeah yeah i just set up for a second
okay oh my god hey it's punky what's going on guys no it's not okay god he forgot his own new
rags he has a skeleton i know i know that somewhere underneath there there's a skeleton
what's that on the wall why it's a skeleton
yeah it is it's got like fucking symbols on it that's some black magic shit there's symbols on
the skeleton i kind of take this like frame by frame i want to see like what's behind him
rags a mauler i think you're gonna have to just keep this
like on your channel while i make it public i'm just trying to make out stuff yeah that's fucking
no it's not punky j anymore my name is jerry jinnis
okay so oh my god look at this
there's so much to deconstruct okay we've got what is what is that the poster of first off
it's another teenage mutant ninja turtle figure this guy is a teenage mutant ninja turtle aficionado
he has the cup he has the plush on the cabinet he has the that's three things and he has like the
bebop guy as well um but what that's a is that a tomb raider sticker above his head can you see it
his skeleton has tattoos i know that's what i'm saying there's symbols on the on the on the bones
what do you think that means it means he's trying to fucking summon something from the
first one to admit i'm not the brightest bulb in the pack that never really bothered me though
because i know i got the swagger and i love the way he's swaggy back then too i had that
fucking uh shape cut which i'm thinking about maybe getting again but i don't think in my 30s
i second guessed it like which i'm thinking about maybe he just say he's it is no he's not it is
30s is it no there's no way i think so i would guess early 20s i'd say mid 20s mid to late 20s
i'd say mid to late 20s oh well then you could probably believe 30s then couldn't you yeah i
that's swag again but i don't know being in my 30s
just because he says it doesn't mean that it's true he may not understand he may not understand
he may not understand human measurements of time he might he might not be aware you know you know
how time passes differently when you're constantly in your room like you don't know
how long time has you know passed so maybe maybe he's like 22 or something that's shit like that
but this is a 30 year old man going to target with his mom the shape of his hair is sticking
out like that is legitimately i love his hair it's so fun like it's so fun anyways guys i thought it
would be funny to watch a video he made of me and i can comment on it so i'll go ahead and
i'll put the camera on the computer and we can check the shit out together so he's gonna be great
he's so happy oh my god this door is door i know it's like it was a little flier so it's you know
why it you know why that's there right why it's because of his hand he closes the door he pulls
it closed with his hand whenever he leaves or goes and so you do that enough and that's what
your door will look like i'm serious like check that's why there's a mark there because he grabs
the door by his hand and you do that a thousand times and it leaves a mark years well i know like
oh my god look at the the the the light switch there's not a cover on the light switch
do you really think he could do that with his hands to the door no no i'm i'm i'm deadly serious
that's why that mark is there i'm 100 i assume someone tried to burn his toe no no i i i promise
you the reason that that's why the marks extend around the light fixture and on the door frame
is because whenever he's coming to leave or go his hand that's where his hand touches why wouldn't
you pull the door knob if you're gonna do that why would you because he's just closing the door if
you're closing the door then you just you don't use the door knob you just pull it guys guys
somebody in the chat said they found chenkyou is long lost but again i don't i said before i
can say it again the light switch does not have a plastic plate covering it wait i can't see the
light switch no no it's right there no like by the door mauler's got a bit of a delay he's got
watch a video he made of me and i can comment on it so i'll go ahead and i'll put the camera
on the computer and we can check the shit out together so oh here we go okay see the light
switch i can see a bit of it yeah to the no just to the left of his face that's the whole thing
i mean it just looks like a black thing exactly those two those two black strips that's inside
the wall because every light switch has a plastic plate covering it i want you to look
at the closest light switch to you right now and it's it's got um it's got a plastic cover for it
what about the theory that the the covering's gone because the fuse blew inside it and actually did
the damage to the door no no i'm i'm telling you 100 like as somebody because my my dad would get
onto me about stuff like this when i was a kid right you use the doorknobs so that you don't
build up black you know dark spots on the doors and walls especially if they're white because
your dirty hands grab that spot over and over and it builds up that's just weird because i use the
handle on my door i know but that but if like for instance let's see the hallway outside of his room
if that hallway goes to the right and he's constantly going out that way he'll put his hand
on the wall to kind of swing himself to the right when he leaves and you do that every
yeah you do that every single time you leave your room with your dirty ass hand because you think
punky jay keeps you know his hands clean then it's gonna build up a dark spot on the wall whoever
writes the jar genesis wiki you need to put that theory from rags in there that's a big theory it's
not i swear to god that's not a theory that's why those marks are there isn't everything about
jarred a theory though it's also up in the air again there's no plastic plate on the light switch
which is shocking how does that not happen because with if you look at the inside of the socket
it's just a basically a thin metal strip that holds a switch on it and then you put the plate
over it somebody said somebody said but why his hands dirty i mean did you look at you guys he's
he's got q tips keeps dirty q tips on his computer desk oh game game motron said we have different
standards for uh switches and electrical stuff in the uk not maybe i don't know i just i didn't
think your hand could be that dirty that it does that you know but i'll believe it i'll take you
in for it i will yeah let me um let let me show you this really quick here all right so um here
oh perfect picture perfect picture i just put it in the disc uh just put it in the discord
that's it oh yeah no i i i can understand that we yeah i'm not sure if ours look like that actually
um but no i believe you and i don't know but he's in america so that no of course um but
why he's in america so we're right why has he not got a cover on it because he doesn't give a fuck
he still shows up swagger he still shows up on hover zoom even though we went past the downward
thrust video i'm just i'm fascinated at at his lack of cleanliness the jared lore is so complex
even his door has his own side story every fucking day every hour of his life he's sitting down at
that desk and there are dirty ass q tips between him and his screen and he just leaves him there
i just love the fact that he's kind of skeleton next to
yeah we're glazing over the fact that he has a skeleton with zodiac
he's gotta worship the skeleton that's gonna be what's going on i wonder what's in his
closet because clearly he took this skeleton so what else is in there there's no room for his
drum set i guess i wonder if sherlock hoes would be able to come up with something from all this
you'd have overload you'd have to take a break
sherlock would be like i quit all right so this is um punky jpc versus console
rebound this is like a classic 2008 years ago man he got 100k views once upon a time
good for him no that's oh wait that's you
oh that's you
i'm so sorry jacks
so what's with the skeleton this is a wife
which really just made me laugh it was mostly just i think for entertainment
but no he didn't keep it or us
oh and the reason these are all 15 minutes is because i had this bullshit community strike at
the time so i could only make 15 minute long videos and for a guy like me that's like the worst
thing ever oh wow so who wouldn't be able to do that oh yeah you just like just end it all
just start a new channel just work on them start a new channel and then when the months go by
actually when you start a new channel are you capped to like 15 minutes um i don't think so
once you verify your account no you're like or your email then you're good but you just
make a new channel hey hopefully it's not just elitist crap but here we go elitist
all right you guys it's like a fucking fair use notice i don't know what that's all about
i think i think it's safe to assume it's a fair use notice
this is like the law oh he has to warn people that he's not being a troll even though he's
being a troll no i'm not that's not what it's sure i know you can't i know you can't read
but the thing is that i just put that in there so people don't go out and abuse people that's
that's right it's it is there in good faith and it always has been and the first one is to protect
me legally for people who are like oh i'm gonna copyright strike your video because it has my
he literally has nothing to do with trolling
all right buddy all right guys
yeah man oh we're going back even further in time i think this was a completely different
room he was in it has its own lore what happened to that room i love his hair
it's what's amazing is that this video is a good idea to do because we get twice the Jared
we can get a bit of rags too yeah well who cares about rags we only care about Jared
this is going back hey so let me just say that i wasn't looking that well that day
i'd probably see the dark spot beneath the handle i can't believe that background is so
funny dark spots all around oh my god he's guys guys guys he's got teenage mutant ninja
tale figurines attached to the wall no oh shit those are hot wheels are they hot wheels
those are hot wheels see the see the logo oh yeah but there was i thought it was actually green
he's attached them to the wall he has they're not even straight
he just like glued hot wheels car packages to the wall
how does this man exist
oh my god how does this happen dude the idea he puts the first one up and it took took a while
he has to do with the ruler the second one he was just like oh fuck it it's like it's too much
it's too much counting but those are hot wheels things yeah man sleep you know haters are gonna
hate but i i wasn't high i promise you i was not high uh i live with my parents i can't do that
shit anyway it's confirmed it's confirmed law rights is it's confirmed is if we needed confirmation
of that yeah for those of you who had the outlandish assumption that he lived with his parents
it has now been confirmed you know what's gonna happen news from now disney will buy the rights
to him and they'll release a film where he lives alone and we're like no you've ruined the law
i know don't ruin the extended universe just take the record guys it was not high all right
hello punky j hi rags this is why i believe
so many layers to this video man this is such a fucking time capsule man i love it jeez
pc gaming um there are many reasons but there are many reasons but
first of all let me just say this there is actually one reason it's cheap dude i have to
mention this okay so it's his original video being commented on by rags being commented on by the new
him being commented on by us this is such a mind fucking it's i'm commenting on a video and he's
commenting on i'm commenting on a video about him and he's commenting on that and we're commenting
on him commenting commenting on him i hope he makes the commentary on this video scream
i'm trying to see if there's anything in the room but i missed it probably is
and i stand by that shit so let's continue on oh but at the end of the sentence what do you mean
but there are many reasons okay rags we get it what god shut up right reason guys is price um
see there we go an xbox one only costs 300 dollars still overpriced let's be frank
he's somewhat right
oh man yeah i was i guess i was at the time i just still overpriced i just love looking at
the reflection of him in the middle where it's just like you can see computer screen and there's
just this big lump of fat right in front of it is a little bit overpriced but still what you guys
have to understand is when i made this back then in 2016 if you wanted a pc that ran the same as
an xbox it still would have been more i don't care what anybody tells me i had a lot of people tell
me that it costs the same that's fucking bullshit so well if it costs 300 to make the xbox and it
would be 300 to make the pc too that was by the way very common argument that you should buy a
console because it costs less but the thing is cost over time it'll be the consoles that drain you
the most oh absolutely and normally what i tell people because i still get computer questions to
this day is i say you know don't don't shoot for the price of a console you know go more you know
go more so that you really get that bigger payoff yeah um because you got xbox live as well yeah
xbox live the new games like sales you didn't need that with the ps3 but again we did covers
like most people would choose the 360 if they're going for friends with online play that would be
the uh the goal so yeah you have to pay for xbox live how much is that good month xbox live
if you buy it per month it's the most expensive i forget uh every year it's like 50 or 60 a year i
think playstation increased there is like 60 a year so i normally tell people basically you could
either pay a company for the privilege of playing your own games that you've bought on a system
you've bought on internet that you pay for or imagine like every year you get a free game for
christmas i mean yeah you don't have to convince me because especially these days because steam has
christmas and summer and everything sales humble bundles humble bundles were like
free game every year just is just given to you instead so pc if i could go out and buy an xbox
one right now for 100 i would only do it just to resell it at its normal value that's shallow
that's really shallow that's shallow rex i wouldn't make $200 what's wrong with you regs
that's so there's like there's no fucking way that punky has a job of course he thinks making
money is shallow good job that's shallow this is of these two machines is vastly different
okay let's speed it up a little bit
oh statistics stop it what is this okay so he's showing me a gtx 960 which is actually
a fairly good component uh 200 but what is this like amazon okay what size is this amazon i don't
know these amazon normally has a high g man back in the day when i was recommending 960
yeah that's how you know this is old dude these 20 series cards look like they're good they're
they're looking spicy so i don't want this to drag on let's just let's just see what he's all
about he's like shut up shut up moving on shut up here okay so he's showing me that
what else is he gonna go into let's see all his pictures okay so he's gonna he's gonna respond
to you based on the pictures
it's this is bold this is bold but i like it
let's see what he says
i'm from the old school i'm sure i'm older than you and all your followers no disrespect
oh get fucked right you just said you lived with your parents and i like i'm older than you
also that's not a counter argument it's like this is cheaper and then he's like yeah but
i want the physical copy no i i understand why people would want a physical copy over a digital
copy yeah but it's all about cost isn't it the whole argument's about cost but the weird thing
here is that doom is an excellent example that i used because i think i went and i bought
because i have a doom like a revenant statue because i i went to amazon and for like 20 bucks
i got the game a physical copy of the game in this metal case and this revenant statue that's behind
me and it was like 20 bucks fuck yeah buy that shit it was like 20 or 30 bucks also we're getting
a lot of solid copies because because of um my history with with youtube people are very
concerned that this won't be available um uh wolf would you want to put it up on your channel
that's like a new video considering it's very close to your podcast sure why not more jared
it's like it has jared say no more there you go guys you can find it it'll be available in a link
on my discord but if you really want to find it it'll be on wolf so let him download it and upload
it there's no reason not to i guess like as as jared told us when we figure it out we'll put it in
the description oh and to clarify subscribe to this man he makes incredible content there's no
subscribe to jared genesis please but that's what i grew up on homie and the fact that he's got swagger
of course he's calling us homie gate that or respect me even so he'd call us homie with the
thing as you can see that character in the right on the right that little person that action figure
oh yeah it's weird that he would start off by saying i live with my parents and then
moments later try to use part try to pull the age card dude you know what the fact you just
made me realize the framing of this we get the the figurine and the poster it's almost like it's
by design because then he says homie it's just like this this is insane i think he's playing
he's like trump he's playing four-dimensional chance this is what people would make if they
were making like a parody thing like look how stupid this guy is yeah he's literally like an
items parody i'm blown away by his quality this is incredible the older dude was really fucking sad
honestly difference and you get insurance i think i buy games used anyways um i i never buy
new 60 games i just don't do that shit that's just me though the reason i brought up game stop
specifically in that last example is because it seems to me that punky j would rather go to game
stop to buy a game used then spend five more dollars and support the developer instead
he's exactly right
he's exactly right who's fucking shallow exactly dude i was about to say if he disagrees with you
he's wrong because when you do when you buy a game from used tools the developers get nothing
yeah that's the thing is like that's that that's why i hate game stop so much because they'll say
oh you save five bucks and then game stop makes all that money you know and i'm like shit man just
i wish you spent the five extra dollars and supported the developer you know is oh i still
feel that way but damn it's like he's it's funny because moments ago he's like yeah rags is in
shallow that this guy's talking about saving five bucks
so far all he's had to say is that i'm right twice there's nothing more priceless than the
fact he spins the camera and goes so i agree just the fact that he has this on a webcam anyway
it's fucking amazing i don't like most game developers i'm just gonna say that oh that's it
wow okay i'm sorry they made the games though like wow yeah man that's tough and it's a big risk
it's a big financial look at his fucking recommended videos there's a fucking
dude dude he's watched it already
so you've got a it looks like a uh channel awesome video yeah ninja turtles and a steven
crowder video but man that he's he's so and that means that recently he's been watching teenage
mutant ninja turtles cartoons on youtube dude imagine putting that together as a profile it's
like this person is interested in a nostalgia critic teenage mutant ninja tales and steven
crowder what does this say it's like i don't know and then i is the thing is like the person that
you're imagining in your head totally wrong i don't care what you think it's totally wrong you
ain't guessing this okay to do this and i understand why he would do this bragging that
you buy new games is oh god is that like text box no it could be a text box damn there is a skeleton
so wake up he's like feed me he's actually breathing yeah he wakes up
because with my he's struggling to breathe in the stench of geras he's like he's like he just
turned on a turbine right next to his freaking camera i don't know what that is man anything
i can plug it into it okay look i know what he's gonna say on this
he's not even letting himself in and she's like oh okay back to me jared jared never stop
never stop being you never stop um i think let's see what was he saying here um you can actually
stream what's on your computer to your tv so yes he did get me there computer i can plug it into a
tv monitor it's so far i'm three and oh i don't understand and you literally have jared on your
team he's like yeah rags is right jared agrees with rags about it's like everything he said
i'm basically right oh wait wait the whole look at those look at those tabs we got facebook
and his inbox for gmail new tab what's that here's why the i can't make out those last two
words yeah there's a little yeah i'll wait here when i can okay no it's a it's his email address
it's on his tab please don't i think i don't think you can make it i was too blurry luckily
don't do it guys it's oh here's why the ford fiesta oh okay here's why the ford fiesta
as if he's you can fucking drive a car then there was this is an email address
there's like maybe someone messaged me have an email address
why he's ford fiesta it's very interesting just like this one
that's a twitter and a facebook so yeah one i don't know fucks 360 are basically both just
the thing is i
i think did you just say that the xbox the ps3 had basically just computed
something so is a calculator it's a little bit of a difference though there yes computer i can
plug it into a tv monitor it's pork kind of performance jarden jaden hmm that's steve
it doesn't matter
oh i was talking oh you're trying to make out the freaking email i want to talk with him
oh then write a comment in his videos oh i need to reach out to him directly don't fucking i
don't know if he fucking idiot he's got his twitter i i want him on my podcast the thing is
he's got someone's real name on the twitter tab steve something yeah that was real talk though
that was probably the smartest thing i said in that video and this is the thing that elitist
can't debate is that they're all just fucking computers he's so what of course they're all
computers what what relevance there's no way that i would disagree that the consoles are also
computers he's like so happy that he understands that consoles are computers i don't understand
what is he and yet they make it seem like they're different they're all just machines that run on
zeros and ones you know what i mean it's just retarded like a calculator as if that does
anything for any argument they're all zeros and ones they'll run zeros and ones he skips two
minutes forward they're all computers that run on zeros and ones back to the screen
uh we'll see what else he's got to say but uh this is getting kind of old
anything the consoles would benefit what do you mean just getting kind of old you agreed with two
of your points three but can you just introduce us to your skeleton and explain all the marking
this was a great video to pick by the way because we got a whole other dimension to his room like
that's a ray i'm gonna complete it in my head that's like season finale jarred genesis stuff
that is we need to watch a new angle of the apartment imagine we got the right side we've
only got the left so far or at least from our perspective anyway so we've got the back wall
which is both mostly window we got the closet in the corner we got the dresser and half his desk
so that basically the door we've got a bit of a desk please see what else is on the wall here
just the desk with the q-tips and the crayon we just need the wall we need the wall um
what that is bed is on that's the one part of the room we haven't seen that and we need the rest
of this wall and the right wall i want to see what's under his desk oh oh no jesus i i shudder
to think of the things that have fallen down there that he couldn't be fucked it falls into
two categories half-eaten chicken leg rotting i was gonna say it falls into two categories living
a good dog living organic
oh my god he's a queer that doesn't
oh my god
oh my god
this sounded so disgusting oh my god we we just gotta go forward and watch the next jared video
after i'm on like a jared now oh my god okay surprise me doesn't surprise okay and he's a
furry take a laptop and plug it into a television if you so desire i bought some for my sisters so
that they could plug in their lap that's nice of you man you're a good brother sisters he's a queer
that motherfucker got sisters what a queer no one fucks my sister but oh god
okay i'll give it to you you're a nice brother okay i am you're a nice son too with laptop gaming
you know you're only going to go up to like 18 inches some nice compliments after being like
oh god i can't believe i can't believe how comfortable is like i can't believe how comfortable
he's just saying that when was this made it was like recently ish right like a year or something
like that um let me check um this is so casual like so out of nowhere oh i mean there's no
there's no fucking um this was a month ago oh this is pretty recent a month ago so a month
ago he response sort of responded to a video that i made like two years ago he's got a marinate on
it for a while which is i'm fine with i'm okay with that because you know as long as you stick
with the as long as you still agree with the video i think it's totally fair game it's just yeah yeah
he wouldn't be able to respond to us these days he'd have to wait for us to stop laughing every
time yeah how much actual content is in our video still not very big uh first off thickness
is way more important than length but if you're playing on a gaming laptop that's debatable if
then how come you can buy monitors that are actually narrow that are tall he took you so seriously
oh my god actually if you consider a monitor inside i actually i talked so politely back then
i'm glad i'm glad i've changed so really that's debatable it just i can't believe that show
could genuinely thought you were talking how big do you want it if it's right okay i mean i would
never want a game on anything smaller than 24 inch and the other thing is that's like a valid point
of the screen size if it's a lot closer face and how that matters by the way for anybody who
is like you guys shouldn't do this because it's like kind of victimizing whatever he just like
got disgusted rags being homosexual or bisexual it doesn't even matter yeah he um this is automatic
but i'm a good i'm a good brother so it is obviously it is now fair game especially that
he's responded to rags we've got all of the things we need to be able to say we're allowed
older than all three of us so it's okay i love that he said you're a queer such a fucking ancient
way to describe this y'all's a queer it's so pure that's not even that huge it's just pretty tall
okay so back then i didn't realize that there were gaming monitors that are as big as tv's so
again i'll give it to rags it's just it doesn't even matter because you could have attached it to
a fucking tv anyway yeah you can have a screen as big as you could buy i thought he already conceded
that point as well however big the screen that you want to put right in front of your face is man you
go for it you guys have to realize that console gamers we we don't know a lot of shit that pc
gamers do because we're not really friends did you really just
you know this whole document i've been making you have to account for the fact that we don't
have all the facts you have to account that we're not as smart as you it wants to take that into
consideration oh my god you know we just chill on xbox live or pia yeah because we're queers
yeah literally the only time i think he's disagreed with you
is to say you see machines of ones and zeros
which which was neither a point i was making nor is it
best for a network we don't always understand shit but that doesn't mean that we're closed
minded okay the truth is someone doesn't work you know what's what's really interesting is that i
got that point a lot from console players and stuff that i'd respond to they always assumed
that they were too stupid to begin to pc gaming and i was always saying no you're not too stupid
it's really simple you could do it it was them making the argument that it's too complicated
to play on pc have you guys noticed the length difference with his eyebrows
um that is very strange oh my god one goes like all the way to the other wow
that is very strange i'm confused
was that was that by choice did he shave off the other one
he was first god about the other maybe it was a horrible maybe the scissors on his desk
or it was some terrible q-tip accident i don't know yeah look at that i'm never gonna be able to
get that out of my head now his eyebrows are almost fucking parentheses
guys an eyebrow that goes all the way down to your eye that is a long eyebrow like mine
jeez wow that's something else man his eyebrows curve they're like they're like arrows oh some
people are theorizing that maybe part of it was burnt off in the accident that took place
in the in the in the jared law there needs to be a section of the jared law called the accident
and it's like really vague just call it like the conflagration of 2017
whoever runs the jared the jared wiki you have to get on this so much lore in this video so much
lore oh ignorant and i'll admit that listen guys you know i could keep playing this shit but
he's just but then i just keep agreeing with kex and that's like bad he's saying everything
that i thought he would um correct let me we'll just we'll put it at the end see what he has to say
okay skip all of the video how is how is that the end
that's the world it's like his own videos he thinks that's the end but really there's a few
more minutes to go where you can just use hand remotes that's what a controller is okay
actually touch pads have been around since the 1980s which oh wait that's about 30 years ago
so and yet despite that we've had touch pads for so long for some crazy reason for some strange
reason there is strange audio change yeah i don't happen to happen must have turned off the xbox
turned off the skeleton
skeleton finally got his breath back moments be quiet shut up
i'm responding you're responding you realize now wait is it bones or bony we have to be definitive
on this oh wait well let's not let's not jump to conclusion let's just refer it refer to it as the
skeleton until eventually the name is provided by another morphinee
maybe it'll be like provided in the next video where he talks wait maybe the skeleton is his
friend no it's it's just like a game or a show where the world is kind of revealed little clues
and hints that's kind of like gerry genesis as like a human being like you pick up a little
bits here and there this is actually a very organic way to meet a person i was just thinking
imagine a random person who's watched my videos catches this stream and it's like me wolf and
rags responding to a guy responding to rags responding to him they just be like what and
then they see him
crazy for some strange reason we still attach keyboards and mice to all of our desktops our
desktops come with them our laptops come with them even tablets almost okay i'm gonna finish
the video with this um a huge debate i had with pc elitist was about mice and keyboard versus
controller the simple truth is it all boils down to preference neither one is better than the other
elitist will tell you that you have more control with the mice that's fucking bullshit
it's not
that's why whenever you go to any mlg competition and they're given a chance they always go with
them let's let's be as objective as possible take an rts like starcraft and play it on
controller against someone with a mouse and keyboard and see what happens yeah um this is
a good argument to go over normally because a in order to explain the difference between the two
a lot of the times you would just bring up there are physical limitations that are inherent to the
design of a controller whereas a controller sensitivity only allows you to scroll at for
instance a max speed and the faster you basically want to have that max speed set the more difficult
it is for you to make more minimal increase adjustments um it's just stuff like that it's
just stuff that's design worthy i mean um ultimately controllers they have to do that
combination thing where it's like okay so we've got these four buttons and these other things
it's like we're gonna have to make a button where it goes a and b at the same time to do a function
okay a and x at the same time to do a function because we're running out of space that's like
double up yeah it happens so quickly while on keyboards you've got an infinite selection of
it's very rare you'll fill up every button on a keyboard for a game yeah it's like my mouse alone
almost has as much buttons basically has the same amount of buttons as a controller it's just
and that's by the way he's right that it's about preference but to say that there's just like no
argument for which is going to be better is wrong the seal yeah it is which one you
which one you prefer is up to you however when we talk about the potential skill ceiling
it is really tough to make the argument that somebody with a controller is going to keep up
with somebody yeah all things being equal i mean it's just it's when if all things are equal and
one is using one and one is using the other it's just the fact that there are hardware limitations
that are inherent to the design of a controller that are going to inhibit the person on the um
the person on the controller like try and outclass a keyboard and mouse person in a twitch shooter
with a controller you can do it it's so much harder though you're oh mauler your your your
things roboting a bit restart that restart what your mic is roboting pretty badly i i can't do
anything other than uh hope it goes away he sounds fine on my end does dishonor both
yours is doing it too oh uh it must be rags on here and rags because i mauler you're coming
in fine for yeah i could hear you fine well um i you two are roboting pretty bad i can actually
hear rags fine though that's the interesting thing yeah that's weird is let's see if the
chat is saying anything about the voices because i can barely make you two out uh he sounds fine
no that sounds fine it's rags not us that's on your end rags yep i'll leave the call real quick
if his robot is usually the internet and then
all right say something hello jared ruined your internet much better yeah that's weird i think i
think that was just discord for me you guys are all good now all right so yeah um there's a reason
that all the pros and first-person shooters they're they're going to be using a mouse and
keyboard if they can in fact jack frags made a video that was pretty popular regarding fortnite
because on playstation you can plug in a mouse and keyboard and he said it was like disgusting
because of course it is because you're it's a shooter you can aim with a mouse
um the xbox one elite controller is very precise it has an extra large no it's not i've actually
used it in a terrible piece of shit it's a thumb stick it means you can't even you know um
when you want to spin fast to i'm trying to explain this in a process that is seriously
objective now you have to push it to the side and then let go when you think you've made it
the right amount while a mouse can literally be one for one the amount of space if you know what
i mean so you know exactly where you're going while with the controller it's there's way more
guesswork because it's a fucking thumb stick as you just admitted that's how they work unless
you put the sensitivity to something just unbelievably extreme you're never going to be
there's a reason why on like if you play games like left 4 dead on consoles there is a
there is a button devoted to about facing you press the button oh yeah yeah spins 180 degrees
yeah well i think they put that in controllers because you can't do it naturally very easily
it's very hard because you have to spin around and i mean just the time it takes for you to look
behind yourself aim assist is a good counter argument why do you think aim assist is on like
every fps that's on console yeah every every halo player you know when you when you try to
shoot a teammate and it's fucking impossible that's why you might not have known it at the time
but if you were playing halo back in the day on the on a console and you tried to hit your
teammates it was very difficult because there was no aim assist when it came to friendlies
it was only on enemies that's why it was so difficult playing without aim assist is like
fucking shocking but with it you can feel like a god sometimes you'd be like wow i nailed that
well yeah well like in halo 4 i think or maybe it was halo i think it was no halo 5 um
i forget here four or five there's bullet magnetism you know about that wolf don't you
oh and both halo four and five they had this serious issue where there's videos out there
where like they put the uh um fuck what do you even call it radical yeah they put it next to the
person's head like they got a super um precise weapon like a sniper rifle and they would put
the reticle next to the person's head and you could see the bullet curve into their head
these are not things these are things that will kill a game on pc people would not play the game
on pc but have these mechanics in it like they literally have to curve the bullets to hit the
enemy for you because of how shit aiming with the controller is and when the whole thing about oh
yeah well i can use it fine yeah that's because you've been playing with the big ass handicap
and it makes you think that you're better than you really are yeah like take it from somebody
who played on controller forever and then moved on to keyboard a mouse just like you'll notice
just play it with an fps and eventually you'll be like oh my god the mouse gives you so much
accuracy i yeah i remember i was getting my ass kicked the first time i played an fps online
yeah everyone's so good it's like you're just not used to it yet you're just not used to aiming
you're used to having because i got this in battlefield three which was the really the big
game that i i maxed out on xbox and then i got my pc played it a lot on pc and so i played it on pc
and then when i went back to x uh to the xbox i was like holy shit everyone sucks in this game
there's no way i should still be alive standing out here in the open while people shoot at me
there's no way i should be alive on pc i would be dead because they would have shot me but on xbox
it's like i struggled and hey i hit things yeah but again though he he opened correctly it is
about preference which when you prefer is about preference that's fine but ultimately the the
killer argument for this now is the who has a pc these days and doesn't have a controller on backup
like most people do yeah i only use it for the novelty for the most part and that's yeah and
that's the thing if you don't use it at all fine but if you do want to use it you have the option
yeah yeah there you go there you go jared work of art and i'm sure anybody could get a work
on that than a mouse um you know really it's just it's debatable but uh i don't believe either one
is better but listen guys you know these last thing is like they're they're two completely
different things do you really think that they're exactly equal these two completely different
things you know uh but listen guys that's just a variation but anyway guys but anyway but listen
guys they're just my opinions you're allowed to think differently but i can tell you guys this
in the end there were a lot of close-minded people it doesn't matter if i said you can't
get agreed with me most of the time so did he just say it's all about opinions and then he said
no actually it's close-minded people i think he i think what he really meant to say was clothes
minded people oh yeah people wear clothes not not that i do
dude that part of his eyebrows really distracting me the uh no it's like an it's like a piece of
dlc for his eyebrows just attached we'll just look just just look at his yellow teeth instead
because the truth of the matter is i'd rather be an idiot than someone who's just
close-minded uh you know erigan and just uh really really sarcastic you know a sarcastic asshole
and that's why i'd rather be an idiot you barely played me in this video i don't know if people
are going to really have that impression of me because i i kind of am but i don't know if you
really put across that because you barely actually play me speaking has there ever been a good
sentence that began with i would rather be an idiot than than a queer
i had to deal with mostly and you know they were mostly just kids i'm sure because i know rags
he's not an older dude like me and i could go into an older dude like me lives at home
talk about how old you are in my ground door in my skeleton with voodoos my super glue ninja
no they're hot wheels please get your lore right mauler an old man rant about you know kids these
days need to show more respect but the truth of the matter is i wasn't can you imagine him asking
you to respect your elders rags i know he knows to expect his elders because they pay the bills
i was just saying he's the one who's that i live with my parents and then tries to play the age
card those two do not mesh well mean in my video i mean yes i did get mean in other videos
when i saw any water bottle that's on his desk right in front of his dresser
it's like a little tiny water bottle next to the wooden thing i can barely make out how he was
still making videos about me but i was respectful in that video oh by the way he said he wasn't very
mean it's that you literally called he's he's lost he's lost any chance he has of saying he's not
mean is it's over you just said it makes sense that he's a queer but now we get to watch this
video where we talked about how you make you know and i got a bunch of sarcastic little shits
name calling me mocking me you know i don't care what anyone says they were all being I guess
doesn't be fair his room was well i don't know i guess he did get a new room
because he already had like the cabinet and everything behind it yeah he used to live in
the basement but now he lives in the attic so upgrade i guess now i can actually see the outside
pretend like he goes out there get some sun heck pulling rude and that's why i made that cringy
shirtless video where i was all mad oh this is this isn't a cringy shirtless video yeah no
it's cringy shirtless man i do regret because i know i was giving rags probably what he wanted
but at the end of the day i don't really know everything i guess i mean it's just whatever
dude it's fucking youtube you know what i'm saying but since those two years yes i have
gone to pc as well but i'm also a console gamer i do not believe either one is better
and quite honestly okay i've gone to pc when he says he's going to pc he played solid
solitary it's probably too complicated yeah yeah you're probably right he probably doesn't
know how to please why can't i put this card here what the fuck
thank you this game is queer this jack looks fucking queer he goes on math games you know
and he plays that little game where you pop all the balloons as they come down to track
nah man he's all about that number munchers oh i do not believe either one is better and quite
honestly i i think people who think you know either one are better they're just elitist bro
they're just you know they have a stick up their butt they think they're better than other people
and quite honestly i just think they're lame but anyways guys i hope you enjoyed this video
i might do another rags video sometime in the future but anyways guys i'll talk to you later
peace he already has done another rags video he went back around show us that desk boy
show us the q-tips come on oh okay no no we have to watch this no you might have to turn
up the volume don't you want to pace it out right do you want to like go back to reality and then
come back to him i don't know it's getting kind of late yeah let me see what time it is because
i had to restart doing the troubleshooting um it is it's 9 30 pm for me what's it for you wolf
it is 10 30 how much time do you reckon both of you got uh i gotta work early tomorrow so
probably like 30 minutes then yeah let's not go through three jareds
in one sitting that could be hazardous to your health what would you like i'm okay with that
um how long is the mario jump one that's probably i would guess 11 minutes i think
which one of these is the shortest
like panther gets action right what's the solo one
yeah let's take a look at that that's what i'm curious about we've all seen solo so let's let's
see how the unfair failure of solo style story also i should probably i'll quickly get through
super chassis i sort of forgot a little bit i was just so distracted by jaredo case
it's fascinating um anime is the cancer that is saving the west i'm not sure that has to do with
oh wait i'm sure it's a jared thing to say you got uh luca blight said mundane matt
subbs dropping harder than demi lavato on oxycontin he's got a boy he's joined the
negative 11k club i'm guessing that's where he's just hit which see that matters more for matt
because of um his his bass was fledgling to begin with yeah you barely had any views anyway so the
people who actually are around who remembered to unsubscribe from him are the pool of people who
were probably watching his content anyway uh freighter sad keel i'm guessing he said because
50 donations are common but not too common i think that is a strong reference common but not common
that's the thing it's not even common but not too common it's common but not common i go pike said
i play 30 fps without issues because i grew up with a sub 30 so i'm not bothered by 30 also
bloodborne was a year two game uh microsoft this gen is technically no exclusives as everything
is also on pc yeah that's very true actually the um the game's got doubled over to try and
mark it on the pc which actually makes them non-exclusive and you'll find what they do is um
they say they're console exclusives yeah which is dirty to be honest yeah um how do i get the
stream to run at 1.5 times you'll have to wait for it to go up and then i don't know why you'd
want to try and speed up jared though he needs he needs his time he needs to get through it uh
we know how some people take those fruit by the foots and they can't like eat it normally
they have to ball it up and cram it into their mouth all at once yeah he's one of those guys
slightly more confusing most playstation exclusives and first party games have little
to no micro transactions and those that do are mostly cosmetics and shit yeah i've been
impressed with how like god of war the shadow glasses remake and um obviously bloodborne i
think it only has dlc doesn't it yeah there's like no nothing obtrusive in my face microtransactions
at all yeah it's not scummy oh my god jared is still active i'm sorry this is nothing to
do with any well i was people have been saying that he did a video recently about why he won't
go on podcast which is kind of like one of the things we have to watch eventually
well i just looked at the comments on his thoughts on having video and he commented like only a day
ago to someone and then someone commented right after that saying please talk to me the best
fortnight was covers too like vocal covers and songs oh i know i saw the my nigga free
rap oh god yeah is that good have you seen that like what the video i mean i haven't seen it
because i wanted i want to experience all of these videos in like a setting like this
where we can all sit down and just like keep each other sane as we watch this man uh fortnight was
announced in 2011 for ps3 and 360 as a survival game so yeah i was just clarifying that it was on
them um this is a different channel he oh he right he uploads to like seven different channels
well he uploaded like literally only an hour so i got the swagger is jared a sue would you guys
argue he's a mary sue possibly yeah no he's got character flaws he's he's got this one or two one
or two jared is the guy from the chicken tendies green text uh then i play all my games on the
steel battalion controller i'm not sure what that is uh you know what's what's interesting
is that his video about why i don't podcast with people he's wearing fucking teenage ninja turtle
that's the pinnacle of jared yeah rocket insider said uh you guys are cool don't go to pc gaming
tomorrow so uh yeah thank you all for the donations and i suppose uh we'll end out with
captain midnight solo video which i don't know anything about this so i guess we'll see maybe
we'll agree with it and it'll be boring and terrible maybe and then we'll be we'll know
the mistake of not covering jared this video is brought to you by skill shame i don't like his
voice not only that just can you put it the end and it contains some major spoilers for solo
a star wars story solo is my favorite star wars movie that doesn't really need to exist i'll dig it
what oh that that makes sense so the pool which to be fair so the pool is solo rogue one force
awakens the last jedi i'm guessing yeah what does doesn't need to exist mean yeah maybe he'll
clarify in a second i mean technically speaking more in a bit oh okay you said he's gonna get into
maybe maybe i guess but first i want to talk about disney specifically how they kind of did
this movie a disservice it's well publicized at this point that solo is plagued by behind the
scenes issues and if you're watching this i probably don't have to tell you about the firing
of the original directors how old do you think that guy in the right is on the right oh wow yeah
he looks i mean i could believe late early 30s he's kind of like jared actually honestly looks
like he's seven he looks like he looks both young and old i was about to say there's a couple of
things that make me think older but then he does look very like he does kind of have that extended
eyebrow look i so i think the reason i stopped is because he looks shockingly like a strange
older version of a very young me which is like really weird like the eyebrows and the the chin
let's think the chin um because i have a cleft chin i used to have my hair this guy looks like
an old version of a young me and it's maybe like if you kind of creepy you take all right everyone
this is no excuse reveal made a good choice by giving the film to ron howard i wasn't there so
i don't know but there's no denying that it lowered people's expectations for the film
then there was the hiring of an acting coach for star hang on yeah but if it did lower people's
expectations then wouldn't that help it if it was a good film i'm not saying that's what he's saying
but let's keep that in mind if he does argue it's a good film are all then aaron like remember like
i know that i went into this movie with really low expectations and the only reason that i kind of
i liked it more than i didn't like it is because i was just like make pretty things on the screen
happen because fuck it that's that's all they're gonna be able to do and my expectations were so low
for this yeah no i think all three of us went in being like this is gonna be bad that it was like
wow it was bad like you know our expectations were very low and it still failed that literally
happens all the time in the film industry but because it happened when it did it only added
to the narrative that the movie was in big trouble but i don't think it was really the
bad press that resulted in solo's lower than expected box office 90 of the blame should be
put squarely at the feet of disney's scheduling whoa scheduling okay 90 percent i mean that's
like basically all the blame you know one of one of my biggest reasons why i think this failed is
that nobody was really interested in seeing a prequel on solo film i don't think anybody really
understood why they should go see that it's like yeah if you talk to the people who love the
original trilogy they're not going to tell you they wanted to see this they don't want to see
who wants to see harrison ford's character played by someone else it's like i'm right yeah it's one
of those spin-off ones i'll skip it i don't want to risk them fucking people up and then add that to
this is the film that comes after the last jedi which is like oh and add that to the fact that
it's not even a good film and that is re-shot so we're all assuming that it's gonna be bad anyway
yeah really like what good news came out of this movie before it was released so yeah a lot of
reasons 90 disney's fault i find that unless he didn't even say disney's fault he said 90
disney's scheduling yeah which where does he even come to that conclusion i guess we'll see in a
second but man that's a lot that's basically all of the blame lies on the time that disney said
which was may the was it may the fourth or was it it was it was the anniversary of when a new hope
originally aired oh was released um solo what a terrible anniversary i know i know may 10th 2018
yeah so may 10th is when a new hope came out i assume and guess when infinity war came out
april 27th yeah which it was still competing with because it was still in the cinema
because everybody fucking loved that film where they were still fucking playing black panther
yeah because marvel owns the cinema compared to star wars which is weird because just two years
ago we wouldn't have been saying that yeah but thanks disney now i i will agree 90 percent of
that is disney's fault oh it's 27 december it's some kind of i was just gonna say there's some
kind of uh reason they released on that date to do with the history of uh star wars i just can't
remember what it quite was it says here it released date may 25th 1977 for the united states
so i'm guessing um oh so it may 10th for the usa
may 25th do you say it was may 10th for the solo film yeah solo film is may 10th 2018 and infinity
war was april 27th so two weeks before uh solo the most the the like the biggest movie since god
came out yeah which is oh this is a bold move that's a bold strategy i would just i would have
said they should have saved it for christmas as well but ultimately i don't even think it would
make that much difference because of just nobody cared really enough people were still talking
about the last jedi at that point i mean they still are but the thing is now we have to wait
till december 20th 2019 i was telling people me and my friends saw it on the release day and one
of the earlier showings as in like one of the first showings the film came out and there was
seven people aside from us and two of them left during the film like jeez it's like that's pathetic
i don't know how many people were in my theater but i do know that we were front and fucking
center so there was no competition for the best seats so i've been more confused by a summer
blockbuster season than i have been this year infinity war opened april 27th it predictably
did great and took the top spot for the biggest opening ever deadpool 2 opened two weeks later
for some reason fox had moved the movie up from june 1st and it resulted in a decent box office
pull but definitely lower than the first then there was solo okay so you have to remember that
the average american only goes to the theater about five times per year and many of them had
already just seen infinity war believe me they would make room and time for infinity war part
four if it'd come out a week later they'd be like fuck yeah i'm paying for that too
and you would think the fact here's the thing the fact that you're even saying that
this is a star wars movie yeah remember that that anything that had star wars name on it
should be selling light hot like hotcakes should be but the fact that people would rather see
superhero movies and star wars movies that's that's because marvel movies are great and i
want to see more of them and star wars is kind of shit and a lot of people have subscriptions
now with cinema stuff so you can like see uh you know x amount of movies um anyway like like i
don't know this argument that it would be too expensive to go and see infinity war and deadpool
2 and solo i'm like i don't know people would make the time and money because they could argue to
themselves they're the movies i'll see this year yeah i mean what else is really i mean it's a
probably right but still just the fact that um this is an argument that's being made it speaks
to the quality of the two and why people are choosing one over the other well i think that
marvels usurped star wars to be honest i think so too deadpool 2 or maybe even both so opening
another blockbuster right after that just seemed like it wasn't a great plan not to mention the
fact that the highly divisive last jedi only came out six months ago for a lot of people
i think the reaction to solo was less wow a new star wars movie and more another one of these
already i think that's fair i think that's fair yeah because that's quick because it goes again
like i said we have to wait until december of next year to get another star wars movie
there was so much time like why did it is odd that they would put it so close to infinity war
when they have all of this time and they've already established this schedule of you know
december a main one and then the shootout and the spin-off from the next december
it is it is odd i don't know about 90 percent but it is odd i don't know what disney was thinking
well they paid the price disney positioned this movie terribly in my opinion and mediocre reviews
aside i think disney's scheduling needs to take the brunt of the blame it's kind of crazy that
103 million dollars domestically is now considered a disappointment no no the important thing is how
much was spent versus how much was made because yeah 103 million would be amazing for a film that
cost 10 quid you know yeah really if i went out and i mean look at the blair witch project exactly
you know that made that that took 12 dollars in a candy bracelet to make so of course it made a
shit ton of money it's just about cost too yeah i mean this movie it i'll tell you one thing solo
looked expensive as fuck yeah and and they spent so much money on the costumes the sets
the designs you can tell is something that i was like this is excessive and the amount of like good
things they got and you see them all for like split seconds like remember the snake vampire
they have it for what exactly at the very beginning at most yeah think of all the time that it take
not only to create but to design and to render and all this jesus all for what if and the thing
was i wasn't expecting a snake monster i was like this will be some guy some job of the hut looking
dude who's big and fat and he's just nasty not some weird worm thing and yeah it is i mean it
didn't do any service to the plot it was just it was just it looked like it it's just we just
want to spend money despite the last jedi costing a shit ton this actually ended up beating it out
this is the most expensive star wars film in history and it's i'm sure tied to the fact that
they needed a new budget to reshoot everything again so it's like two films in one i wonder what
the film we didn't get to see was yeah most people think it would have been better because
it was lord and miller but i don't think it's been better just because law of averages means
that any film randomly will probably be better than this but in the ridiculous current state of
the film industry where studios opt to bet big on a few movies rather than giving smaller budgets
to a lot of mid-tier movies these things really do have to be huge every single time in my opinion
if they had just moved this back to like november or december that shouldn't matter as to where it's
released that's a problem that's a that's a fault of disney's choice to spend so much money on it
like that that argument should be tied to that rather than saying
you know this would have worked out if only they'd released it at christmas time or however else
rogue one production cost it says that um the budget was 265 million for rogue one
and solo
where the stiffest competition it would face is mary poppins and that sequel to a harry potter
prequel that people weren't really that into it probably would have done to the i i fucking forgot
there were even harry potter movies i'm pretty sure there are there are some die-hard fans of
fantastic beasts by the way i i i legitimately forgot that harry potter was still like a thing
well this is a prequel series that's covering because dumbledore's in this as far as i know
oh okay he was a queer
much better it would have given people a little time to get excited about the franchise again
but it also worked out really well for rogue one which opened to a much stronger 155 million just
a few years ago in december
that was random okay i'm going to have to do with anything i'm gonna chalk that up to a style choice
because that doesn't make any sense at all just thrust whatever you went into the video don't
worry about but enough box office stuff let's get how much money do you think fucking went into
this bar scene i know yeah with all of the costumes well dude that's them scissor punch
right there that's that's the the lobster face dude that's them scissor punch and he apparently
his scene got cut because of like how ridiculous his fucking name is and people's response to it
his name is lobster punch them scissor punch
exactly what kind of a name is that's like a parody name
i think they thought the stowels names are just stupid and then they were like oh wait you guys
don't like this oh no hold my beer to the movie it's oh it makes sense given that they trivialized
Han Solo's name and it's like let's make it a joke yeah they don't care about names do they
it's weird because i'm gonna i'm gonna rp with um uh like ritualist and nuka and aden and stuff
that i'm doing and i i play a werewolf whose name is hench squat thrust
that's better than fucking norton scissor claw or whatever by the way someone in chat said
they're done and they're gonna check back if ever i make something that isn't stowels related
have you not seen all the stuff we just did with with uh everything's been not stowels up to this
point which all the jared videos that's i don't think you can yeah dude you're like this is like
the third how long have we been going how long has it been streaming going three hours and 20
minutes and we covered what was down with thrust video that was all about ps4 yeah this is the first
star wars content we've well i just remembered we actually did watch a review of the force
awakens but that was big
i mean how much money do you think okay how much money do you think it costs to make all of these
spires with the carvings and then to transport them out here and put them in and put all the
rocks around them if this was just a sandy beach with no work done to it it would serve the exact
same effect and it would have caused zero dollars it's just like i i get it but at one point are you
just throwing money at a booby you know like just spires and they've got symbols on them i think
they got into their heads that um the originals had practical effects the prequels were criticized
for having old cgi which isn't actually the case and so they were like guys we need to bring back
the practical effects bring them in tenfold these are just like even if they didn't have
them it would still be just practical set just a dune next to an ocean it would look lovely
i've seen this movie twice now and i really enjoyed myself both times
this side of the star the third time i wasn't even bored
but my verse has been my favorite since i was a kid smugglers bounty hunters
all that good stuff i've always preferred it to the much more serious jedi and sith
and yeah as many people online have pointed out the movie does get a bit too winky with
the audience like the scene where han gets his last name is uh oh come on just this is the thing
it's like you know it's awful you don't need to be like okay yeah it's not that great
but it's star wars you can't say bad things at star wars
and i'm gonna we're gonna give him a lot of space here because my god this film's plot uh
it is it is a it is a plot as long as as long as he's just he's nicely gonna say you know this is
i think it's neat it's like yeah that's fine that's good not great but other than that i'm
really gonna stick up for the way that this movie uses the star wars universe episode seven was very
obsessed with mimicking the look and feel of the original trilogy to the point where the force
awakens almost feels too indebted to it and afraid to do anything new gee you don't say
that's a hot take that's i don't know
expect some angry comments over that one
the last jedi took the star wars mythos very seriously as well but in a different way no no
what in the will do you mean no no no i we're not even gonna we're not even gonna
we deconstructed it now you can love the way it did that or i love deconstructed it as if that
means something good like deconstruct yeah we've destroyed everything about it this may sound weird
to say about solo a movie with far too many winks to past films in it but it feels like it just
takes a much looser approach to the star wars universe what does that even mean yeah i was
like what does that mean a looser approach to the star wars universe i we've we've done this
we've said this before about other videos but guys when they do this they're just hoping that
you have a perspective on what that means they want you to fill in the blank with whatever you
think he's not saying anything he wants you to think what he's saying yeah this is not his
thought this is your thought he's saying this is basically the script equivalent of the n-word
this is you you're doing the thinking the the thoughts in your head he's just nudging you
kind of towards it the way to know is that take like five random people and then ask them what
um han solo is a more loose approach to the star wars law don't you agree and then one of them goes
yeah they don't really they don't really mention the law and then someone else goes yeah they they
have a lot of the law in it but they sort of play with it a bit and then someone else goes yeah they
stick really close to the law but the story is loose i'll agree with that and you're just like
none of these people agree with each other they're all coming up with different things
it's it's they're so ambiguous it's meant to be melded into whatever it needs to be
instead of being so invested in the lore of star wars it just sets up a good old-fashioned
space western unless it you just said never let's think i never thought that this none of none of
this movie said western to me and he just said that they have loads of references which they do
the references are really annoying they keep saying things that people like oh that's star wars
oh that's stars oh yep that's another thing from the prequels oh that's from the ot that's oh that's
his name oh it's like yes so divorced and plays with with being a western also yeah being a western
what does that even i mean i can strike you as a worst man i this one shot is about it i was about
to say this scene sure but the rest of it yeah we're like there's about to be a standoff that
doesn't happen the part where they escape from the god king of the kathulu monsters and shove
him down and into this just interdimensional well that didn't come across as a west that just
screams clean eastward it accurately mirrors the um the tune of the harmonica from once upon a time
in the west you remember the good the bad and the ugly re-killed kathulu with the black hole
i remember yeah here's my favorite cult yeah the cold favorite he picked up from the union army
dude a cult that fires a black hole that'd be awesome i'm telling you man we're getting into
enter the gungeon territory here and i'm liking it play out now does it have the beads that you'd
expect a solo movie to hit you've never seen a western in his life i don't think he has maybe
he means like a movie made in the west like the western movie in the west like as opposed to an
eastern movie maybe his only western movie is boys and aliens is not a western movie
it's not a true western like cowboys and aliens they handled the actual movie oh i know i know
it is yeah it's got daniel craig in it yeah but i'd also argue that it never feels weighed
down by them carillia does that mean weighed down run it all feels pretty good fun and i especially
like there was just like what the fuck is in this movie and if fucking mandibles and the eyes moving
on that puppet man it's like look it looks good but you're like damn this movie costs a lot
it's just and to think the gambling it's reduced it could have been even more huge
i know it's just it's weird that i'm calling it out but it's like it's everywhere in this movie
you know it's like everything it's like they went out of their way to spend money
you know it's so otherworldly and you know that especially with the understanding that
it costs them so much hey rags what does it mean to be weighed down in the film
um it means uh the character is a fat guy ah i knew it jared genesis
jared genesis he's not a fictional character consult the book of jared to be able to answer
this question the book of jared chapter two of verse 17 of the book of jared states being weighed
down is um there is a video in which to reference we must view a sudden slowing or um of the pace
of the plot and our character progression used in a film often relating to dialogue between
multiple characters or excursions from the main plot often always be plots well i i think that's
a great verse but jared the book of jared verse 23 17 clearly states and so the great and almighty
jared said they did it all right the way that they did you guys anytime you do that you have
to end it with but anyway guys and and jared said and anyway guys anyway it's the equivalent of our
bed it's but anyway guys but anyway guys but anyway guys scenes with donald glovers lando
honestly one of my biggest complaints about this movie is there just wasn't enough of him his
performance is wait who lando lando his performance is interesting in the sense that he doesn't
anything like lando yeah i mean he's like an unusual character who is nothing like lando
i love that they took the fact that lando wore a cape in the other ones and made it so that he's
obsessed with capes and gets upset when he loses a cape and he has many capes in his clothes that's
how you flesh out characters you go what did they do in the originals it's like lando well he did
nothing really aside from where capes so that's really what we can take with him you know that's
that's good they did it all right the way that they did it jared faggons jared faggon but anyway guys
because in many ways it's but anyway guys it's a lot more over the top than billy d williams but
in a very believable way it is very lando could you possibly quantify that in a more believable
fucks robots i didn't yeah but he's pansexual sir the thing is is like lando's character here
it's not that it was like bad acted it was just the wrong person i felt like they wasted
have done a good job it's just that he just played a different character
he played some eccentric kind of guy no yeah i i really didn't connect that he was lando really
i was just like oh it's it's don't lover there he is no it's black guy that's that's donald lover
it's a queer that's lando well that's like i i i said that's donald lover not that's lando calrigian
that's the actor not that's the character but he was believable because reasons but has just as
much style but doesn't have the actual life experience or clout to back it up instead of
being the leader of cloud city you get the impression that lando is actually in a really
tough spot and kind of trying to bluff his way out of it and that's a really fun take on the character
pretty sure he's not in a tough place he wins all the games yeah like he cheats the star in the
center of the attention and he knows everybody and he seems to be i'll admit for some reason
the millennium falcons booted if you remember i don't know what they were trying to say with that
but landa's not struggling for money especially with how he can cheat you have to keep that in
mind it's it's it's it's almost like the thing was impounded just so that we can get the weird robot
thing about don't look at me while i piss through this thing someone in chat was like
think about what i said with the the capes think it's like applied to the millennium falcon
what can we do with the millennium falcon it's like well make it flirt with its owner and you
know have it engage in sjw rallies to oh god why you know what i always say is it's better to be
an idiot than close-minded but anyways guys it's like what can we do to make the millennium falcon
totally trivial but play up the capes play up the capes he has a fucking cape room like what
they're doing the reshoots and ron howard's like we need more capes we need more capes sally get
more capes they probably couldn't when they were considering the reshoot they were like oh we have
all these capes we have to keep them that's gonna have to be in the storyline although it's just too
much wasted money so so i posted on twitter i linked jerry's most recent video and i said
like this video subscribe to his channel and comment telling him to come on my podcast
and i commented and my comment's still there but he deleted every other comment that was on the
page oh no it was it was all nice comments too i don't understand jared that's weird because he
said he'd rather be an idiot than close-minded so i'm not saying he's wrong i'm saying i don't
understand he's seen all the jared beams on twitter yes i'm aware hang on i gotta show you
guys on twitter he they've been uh they put his face on top of kylo i said he was like oh my god
this looks like a fucking painting it legit looks like a painting i told him i told him it looked
like he was in the renaissance put put put that on the stream um oh my god please tell me you
retweeted that i had that chance yet i need to i need to retweet that myself that's beautiful
oh my god
that's so beautiful that is the greatest
um that is legitimately impressive and it actually does look like a painting
that's that's amazing okay anyway so back to the guy talking about solo's not that bad
i also really liked woody harrelson as beckett i feel like most coverage of the movie i've seen
hasn't mentioned just how good him and paul bettney as drydon are in this movie i mean i like i
like drydon i thought he was a fine actor but i wouldn't be like yeah that was amazing yeah
i believe the character i was like i believed the character i was like yeah sure that's uh
that's the person he's portraying but i wasn't i wouldn't be like yeah you should see the movie
just see this guy's performance it's pretty easy yeah it's kind of a i don't know i get lost on
both of them because of the end scene where everyone makes decisions that completely confuse
the hell out of me both the villain and uh beckett do things are just like this doesn't benefit you
though why are you doing this and then both of them die it's like yep that was expected
the guy that han could have so easily become if it wasn't for meeting luke and obi-wan even
after shooting him you can tell that han respects beckett a lot okay how does it transition into
because this is actually a more accurate representation of londo karajan's character
i think they're supposed to just act as buffers between his segments and i don't know tonally
very confusing what's interesting is that i'm actually having an artist kind of do something
like this where i have they're doing an image and i told them to like what i kind of want is almost
like this like um you know how if you go to like chill hop uh channels they have like this
semi anime kind of thing where it's like late at night or they're looking over a cityscape and
it's just this very calm image that music's playing over like i want something like that
so if i want to put sections in my videos it can play and it's got like the outline of my dog or
something like that not this weird all of a sudden dancing thing you know something that's kind of
thematic that i can put in their shortness i just don't get it man transitions people find
them difficult apparently i don't know i think don't have them just keep going
it takes work to make these you have to get this footage and put it in just
just keep going just keep talking just just go
and drident i honestly don't get how people aren't talking about this guy is a legitimately
great villain what makes him so fun to walk like he's very simple he is boss of bad guys he wants
fuel go get hit or he kill you yeah i mean he i mean he did fine his face likes his face goes
redder when he's mad okay and this is the thing you could be like oh you you're saying that when
darth maul is just like yeah i'm not saying darth maul's a good character either that's like we've
got very limited information here hi darth maul who's in this film i don't know explain to me why
he's such a great villain please i tell it this guy he's a mychemical romance fan that's why he's
got all those scars i i think you're right cuts his mouth you put leds beneath them as well i don't
know maybe maybe he just lives in london oh can you imagine all the acid attacks dude like the next
start was episode nine gerry genesis is the villain i think that would fix the the whole
series probably like they don't defeat him they join him it's it's all whatever but you know
it's like the force and stuff it's fine but anyways guys i think the way they did it i like
the thing they did yeah the way they did it i think they did it the way and ray is just like teach me
teach me please and he's like i would rather be an idiot because he's my kid he goes up to kylo
ren no kylo ren takes off his helmet and he's like oh my god he's a queer oh my god he's a queer
i knew it yoke splooge said jared replied to dishonored wolf's invitation on his recent video
do you mean specifically or do you mean he said in general that he doesn't want to go on podcast
because that doesn't really count if he doesn't i got it guys lol i'm flattered some of you want
to see me on some what i have interest thank you at least for thumbs up i really do appreciate it
okay everyone thumbs down the video now just because they won't do it no we want to encourage
him in the future yeah that's right i can't do that jared please please come anything that has
the word jared or genesis in it i don't care if it's the subway guy or if it's the band upvote
if the subway guy or the yeah he's like henry clay henry if i you're a man and a jared fan from
subway he got real big on burgers and fries now he's down to a smaller size he's henry clay henry
you're gonna bring in the skeleton at some point in the what if the skeleton's name is henry ah
again we can't we can't assume we have to wait for the confirmation yeah we got it i'm not ready
to make a call i take the atheist position on the name of the skeleton is that i don't think
he's faking the niceness on some level he's literally an actor i don't even oh well maybe
he means like like the character is being i don't know i feel i have no idea where this video is
gonna go anyway i'm confused it's it actually does it's a series of like very very vague vague
points about how good the film is it's the kind of thing that really works for anybody who loved
solo which there's not going to be a huge amount of those yeah if you like solo you'll like this
movie i guess and even if you didn't really care for solo that much if you don't care you're not
going to be like and if you like quinton where's everything subjective this video will work just
fine because you just be like yeah that's his opinion then but if you use jared response theory
this video falls apart with jared's response theory come on exactly it just shreds doesn't
stand up for seconds or the scrutiny does care about the people he does i can't wait for jared's
solo review just also it's probably not going to come out for another two years but
i don't think he's faking the niceness on some level he actually does care about the people he
does business with he's just also a psycho that flies off the handle at the drop of a
listen to how you just assessed that he's nice also he's psychotic you're like he's a psycho
cat who flies off the handle the the first time we see this guy he's murdering somebody
but he's nice the the first second we see of his character he's murdering a guy
but that's when he's being evil that's not when he's being nice he's
he if anything he comes across as as pragmatic i mean like he he doesn't instantly kill everybody
because he knows that if they're dead they can't possibly unfuck the situation they're in
it's just he he doesn't he he's i can't call him nice because he's literally like uh yeah i'm
gonna kill you now and they're like we'll get you your stuff and he goes okay but if you don't i'll
kill you and they're like okay yeah if he he's analytical like i said he's pragmatic if he he
finds a use for you then he'll let you live as long as you continue to have a use but he'll kill
you if he doesn't have find you useful and i i do i did like the scene where it was basically
harrelson and solo and all those guys going back to him that first time and they're trying to work
out you know how do we get this thing alive because i'm like okay i feel like this bad guy
we you know might actually you know try and kill him or something because he but jeez it's like
he's not a nice guy he's fucking kill your ass i just i feel sorry for him because when he was
right at this he was like i think he genuinely cares about these people outside of when he's
a horrifying psychopath okay yes yes there's that but he's a nice guy he loves me i know he hits me
but but he deep down he loves me and that contrast made for a really good one-off bad guy
comparing him to someone like captain fast why compare where do you even start comparing
phasma's the bomb of the barrel dude you cannot go lower i think the first i think the first scene
that we see with drident voss is longer than the entirety of all of phasma scenes
that meeting that first meeting i think you're right yeah i think it's longer than all of phasma
scenes in two movies i mean it's what's for tell me what phasma's first name is captain
the generic empire guys of rogue one and there's just no content i even this guy hang on by generic
empire guys of rogue one does he actually include tarkin in that selection i don't know because even
this guy here was like you could tell like he was his loyal he was loyal to the point but his
personal ambitions were more important yeah his whole thing was wanting to be in power wanting
to prove that he deserves to be in power yeah it's like even i got that is and rogue one didn't
even have like anything in the way of characters except the funny robot but even then it gets
across like this guy like i get this guy i know the kind of person yeah i would say this guy's got
a stronger character than basically all of the good guys aside from the robot yeah the robot is
like i like the robot everyone like it says something that the robot is liked better than
all of the human characters yes darth man why do i have to bring in darth more short random
tangent i was watching the overwatch short the last bastion and i was like this little fucking
robot and the bird like i was i'm i'm i'm really i really am a softy at heart and like i'm super
sentimental it's like i was tearing up at the last bastion and i'm like i i like stuff like that you
know but all of these characters they're nothing to me give me seven minutes with fucking a robot
that doesn't have any lines a dialogue in some overwatch short film and i have more emotional
connection than anybody in any of these new star wars movies i just don't know these people i
would easily just compare phasma to brianne and game of thrones like the amount of work they put
into each of them in terms of why you actually connect and care about these people and and yet
the actress probably would promote phasma more than brianne yeah but phasma has one barge and
marina has no barges this is true small was um the bar do you do you love what about ism by the way
where it's like you prove this thing is bad and it's like but this thing's what about the scene
in attack of the clones where oh yeah but but what about uh in the new hope and where luke says this
charadee buddy
Jedi master charadee
like how we're talking about how fucking he's like oh i guess darth maul's here
yeah i was gonna say like the reason this this video is not as bad as um
down with thrust and stuff because this this feels like 10 minutes of but i liked it
yeah it's an opinion someone should photoshop jared's page and like make it all
with the little lines to make it really look like this is jared a movie
he was there which just feels like a strength please do that
contest darth maul was uh well he was there which just feels like a strange decision considering
that his entire arc on rebels is already over i'm not really sure yeah but how many people
know about that and why are you bringing that in what is this point i don't know what they could
do with him that's both interesting and doesn't violate the continuity of that show maybe they'll
just oh do you really think they give a shit yeah they don't give up bro wow they start caring about
continuity they just you chose the wrong franchise cartoon whatever ultimately that scene just worked
to conclude cara's character arc but it didn't no it didn't what was your character arc that
that's what my dad said it's just is weird this is what my dad said he's like oh i liked how it
turns out that she was working for maul and not drident vos and like but that just pushes that
just kicks the can down the road one more step because instead of working for vos now she's
working for darth maul in the sith with which makes even more questions pop up it doesn't close
her character it makes more questions and then which which would have been possibly answered in
the rest of the trilogy of the solar films but that's canned there's no way that's happening
and that wasn't bad exactly i know a lot of people hate god you really convinced me with that
that wasn't bad exactly okay it was bad it was only bad sort of
amelia clark's acting but i think she's perfectly fine here the what do you mean what
i thought her character was shit she's not saying anything can't say something isn't so
much in clark's acting it's that her character's motivations just don't quite gel they keep
alluding to how much she's changed and all the things she's had to do to survive but we don't
get any deeper than characters just reminding us of that fact every half hour or so this does not
sound like you're praising the film yeah that that sounds like pretty fair criticism because
it's like who oh you're that girl oh now you're the right hand woman yeah he's right dude and
you're supposed to be like you escaped and all these things happened and you're back and the
movie's still going oh okay her being a secret dark mall ally is fun but there's almost no
background for how she got there so it was kind of hard to stop stop helping the opposite argument
it's confusing i thought this was about how it's unfair that this film failed yeah but let's get
back to the very first thing i said in this video the idea that maybe this movie doesn't need to
exist i realize how harsh that sounds so i should probably explain what i mean one of the things
that i've always liked about han solo is that he's just kind of a guy a cool guy with the confidence
and looks of 70s harris and ford sure but still just a guy unlike luke he wasn't preordained to
be important like no force ghosts are ever going to pop it into chat with han about his destiny
he was just a scuzzy dude in a bar that found that if he could just find it within himself
to stick out his neck for others a little bit he could be something more than a smuggler but
the effects that prequels have just intrinsically i think is that they can't help but mythologize
their lead and i don't really like that well no they do the opposite he just said all that to
say he didn't like it too yeah the thing is no they don't mythologize the lead they explain away
the mythology that is in the ether out there it's like now all of this stuff it's no longer mythos
it's like this is the star wars canon all this stuff this is solid proof of what happens to the
character that's the opposite of expanding on the mythology yeah they boxed him they give him a
history that's definitive now yeah that's the opposite of mythologizing him sorry but i'm just
looking at the chat and there's so many jared memes there's jar wars jared jared binks
general jarius obi jaradopi social jared wookiers social jared wookiers
jared
the dishonored jared
darth genesis
the thing is i could believe darth genesis can jared be a jared
jaradium falcon moth to jared kylo jared all right so all right let's be fair i want
you to look at this picture in the discord and tell me this couldn't be related to the chick from
blade runner oh my god tell me that couldn't be the chick from blade runner's uglier sister
back to the jared intrinsically meta is that they can't help but mythologize their lead
and i don't really like that it's okay if han didn't have an interesting life before his
run-in with luke and obi-wan and if he had just been kind of a small-time self-aggrandizing
smuggler that's part of what makes his character arc in the original trilogy so good go back and
re-watch that cantina scene and pay close attention to allaganis' obi-wan in it he's clearly looking
at han and thinking yeah this guy is full of crap but he's probably the best we're gonna do
the millennium falcon and i don't even that's not even a bad take that's yeah i agree i i didn't
pause it because i i i was yeah that's it i'm so confused though because i i was expecting to
convince us the solo was good not jump-scared jared again but yeah queer gone jared
and
cad jared jared the jarlick
moss jared spaceport bd jared jengo jared jarakin jarakin sky jettison queer gone jettison
you are a legendary ship that he was always destined to have
it was now those are the reasons jared no yes jared general i'm sorry but jarakin sky jessica
jared jared jared spencer
these people are too good okay
now all the cancer is gonna be on your channel soon
at least people can see the chat so they'll understand what we're reading ryan john genesis
oh yeah falcon in new hope isn't some legendary ship that he was always destined to have
it was he's a junk now those aren't reasons that han is lame the reasons that he's awesome
he's not the important hero destined to win the day from his first appearance
he's the guy off to the side making fun of that very idea and that's what makes him so beloved
that's so weird because i agree with you so why is the film amazing i don't understand
tell me why it's good tell us why it's good
family to me
it's making it good so even though i really liked solo a star war story taken why
why he said the villain was good and harrelson was good and then he explained in detail why it's bad
he said lando the villain and woody harrelson were good and he was wrong
but oh it would have heroes in this fight on its own terms i really hope that disney
stops digging up the past and starts leaning into new creations in the star wars mythos
it's a big guy i mean yeah sure isn't the last jedi future isn't the last jedi attempt to do
something new so it's a little bit more complicated than just do something new
do something new that's good that's yeah that's it i'm not i'm not upset because it's new i'm
upset because it's crap alexi after all and there's no need to keep having to tie into the
same three movies over and over that's an odd pan angle yes but oh my god will excuse it someone
photoshopped jared's face on the key on twitter is it is it well done on twitter yes it's actually
really well done i didn't realize it was a photoshop oh wow yeah that's actually i don't
have my twitter i put it put it in the discord i love it it says behold behold jiradi
wow that's that's pretty good that's that's pretty good it's funny because someone else
tagged us all in another one just it's like literally one of the worst photoshops ever made
sometimes those are the best i mean it's literally just a picture of kiyote movie and then
doubt jared's face and spliced it on top of it and then there's that one where it's like really
good that's that's legitimately really good it's it's weird it's weird how good it is
that's a big galaxy after all and there's no need to keep having to tie into the same three movies
over and over again solo may not be taking off like disney wanted and that kind of bums me out
because i really enjoyed a lot about the film what about the attack on the anyways
steer the ship in a more interesting direction i'm obviously a lifelong star wars fan so digging
into a topic like this is a lot of fun but convey did you my thoughts did you dig in did you did
you really take um did you i don't know man you don't you don't you don't sound like captain
midnight i feel like captain midnight would have a really smooth voice yeah i feel like you'd be
pleasant to listen to anyways guys i'm your father but yeah that that wasn't if i listened
to this review i'd be like this is i guess you like it because you you know yeah like i'm not even
trying to be mean all i got really from this was uh that he really likes himself and that he made
a decent point about how Han Solo as a character was never meant to be the center of attention he
was always someone who would actually make fun of that sort of thing and just try and he's a
survivalist you'll or opportunist his his best points were against the film no so maybe maybe
make another one you know visually can be pretty tricky i learned a lot through trial and error
but i also really loved this amazing course on producing video and that's where the video is
i have you noticed how many people have to do it i i know it's kind of an unfair complaint but when
they're like and so Han Solo the movie and if you think about it skill share will be a good place
that you're like wait what i thought you were i thought you were on one topic they've jumped over
oh it's a it's an ad i see it's a segue yeah it's like it's it's fine it's fine to have a sponsor
it's fine to have a sponsor and it's i guess it sounds less forced if you do segue it but still
it feels a little bit like but it's like lint like what lindy beige does right he's like at
the beginning he's like this video is brought to you by like great courses plus more on them later
and then halfway through the the video he'll talk about great courses plus and then i'll continue
but anyways rags
star wars the force anyways
from window
literally the video is over because he's just talking about how good skill share is
yeah i bet it's pretty shit why x-men dark phoenix will never hit theaters that's a strange one
um say what that's what it says for me for the next one i don't know that's it i'm not
going to click his video to find out because i find it annoying that that's the whole point
of his fucking thumbnail the jared unleashed jared nader genesis star wars the last jared
anyway jared uh i was gonna say are we gonna we're gonna cut it there folks are we gonna
we're gonna end it there yeah uh yeah i think so that was a good four hours or so four hours
yeah and there was what is it with us just four hour shows all the time because time flies when
i was gonna say you can't cover a jared video without going at least two hours i'd say that
i mean there's so much it's so dense um i was gonna say there's been a few super chats uh check
out what what do we want from a star wars movie i've not heard of who or what that video is i'm
afraid so but oh oh if anybody has the copy of the star wars video that mundane matt did
please email it to me yeah it feels like email it to me i don't know who would have that i don't
know if there's like a mundane matt archive but yeah that would be 12 people that watches videos
anyway if one of you guys there's dude there's probably somebody who has it there there's got
to be out there it's just that it's hard for you to contact them i suppose it's just like we're
i don't know where to start looking that's the thing but if anyone out there does have
it's the old jared too
now wait a minute matt
hey maul a big fan of you all i know you don't want to review the witcher games but have you
actually played any of them no that's that's why i don't want to review them as i haven't played
them so so there's so much in them i was going to say yeah we've talked about this before
if i was to review them it's going to be a billion years long and oh it's going to be
there's so much it's like it wouldn't be a project it would be like an adventure it would be a life
experience and just talk about all this stuff and all the character jesus christ man look at
this uh this is the last donation um i get called alt right on reddit for even bringing up the
talking points you and wolf use when it comes to forced diversity not a surprise you gotta be one
or the other you have to be alt right or an sjw pretty much that's like the only two choices you
get oh my god someone made another jared adi moondi and it's just as good too it's because
it somehow flows off the tug of aid or jeradi but it's like that could be real uh why is this
opening up in microsoft edge so anyway we're probably gonna knock it off there uh the the
few answers to questions you can whilst probably gonna re-upload this as a video released on his
channel so you'll be able to see it there for infinite time and space uh and i'm not sure when
i'll be streaming again next lime green hunk but hopefully this was a lot of fun for you guys it
was a lot of fun for us and of course god yes thanks for the incredible generosity of many of
the viewers today it's been very kind someone called mundane matt bolder fete bolder fete
i like it osaba been genesis yeah uh there's there's links to i guess we should try and provide
a link to jared's channel uh just put in chat just look up jared genesis jared genesis
obviously you should subscribe and say you're big fans and you can't wait for more content
and that uh he should guest on wolf's podcast people can look through all of his videos
and he can they can just like tell me you gotta do this jared video or you gotta do this
yeah he has a video on choosing the right drumstick and all sorts of literally infinite content
years and years and years of content but anyway guys
this i think uh you'll probably see us again with wolf's next podcast i imagine or uh whatever else
you should subscribe to all three of us if you're in this chat because i don't know why you wouldn't
be and uh other than that i guess we'll be going so goodbye toodly doodly doo wow wolf didn't say
