What were you talking about, Eureka?
This better be what you're referencing.
Hang on.
Well, because I'm thinking of a BBC show called Eureka.
It was a sci-fi original series.
It was a sci-fi original series.
Oh no.
Are you referring to the CBBC show?
No, no, no.
Um, Eureka was a, a, a sci-fi original show about a town that was full of geniuses.
That, that was-
I remember that.
Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Haven, which was the show I brought up, which is a, it's a show that was extremely
loosely based on a Stephen King novel.
Um.
Yeah.
Me and Jay are thinking of something very different.
Really God.
I remember a TV show on BBC called Fucking Eureka, but I don't think that's
what Aiden's talking about.
No, but it's the thing that I just linked to the thing that you are thinking about.
If it's Fear and Cotton, then yes, because Fear and Cotton was BBC.
Definitely not.
That is definitely not it.
Ariel, what are you talking about?
What?
Don't get distracted.
It's fight.
Jay, this looks so fucking bad.
My point is like Haven, Haven ended up becoming just a Twilight ripoff.
Excellent.
Uh, when Fear and Cotton and Holly Willabooby were competing on that one show.
Is this the show?
That is Holly Willabooby, right?
Yeah, it's weird that you remember that.
Cause I hadn't, I wasn't even like consciously aware of the fact that I remember.
It's very British.
If I said Holly Willabooby, you have to be very British to know what I'm talking about.
I don't even know what you're talking about.
You see, Jay's not even British enough.
Well, I'm not that British.
No.
And I'm not saying that as a criticism.
It's good that you're not that British.
There's some, there's some people, this thing right now, like, oh man,
but I'm that British.
Yes.
Yes.
And we don't have a time limit anymore.
We can just go on forever.
Well, we do, we do have a time limit.
No, we will never expend that.
I don't think we will.
Anyway, I'm standing by such a claim.
Anyway, go, go on, Aidan.
We've been interrupting you rudely because we're longman.
Oh, I have completely forgotten what I was even talking about.
Oh, my point was that some of these more kind of like, okay, but generally less
characterly involved shows or character involved shows people don't care about
so much, but shit like Star Trek and Buffy and all those other stuff, a lot
of the shit we're talking about, like the characters actually matter to people.
And that's why you can't screw with it or reboot it.
Yes, usually, you know, because the characters meant something.
But usually they were portrayed by their original actors.
No disagreement from me.
I told Wolf after we'd finished it, I was like, this is getting rebooted,
or at least they want to.
And he was just like, no, no, you don't reboot this.
It's it's a perfect storm.
You don't recreate this.
It's not possible.
And if someone gave me all the money in the world, I'd be like, no, you don't do it.
You create something else because you can't recreate this.
It's not happening.
Would you would you be happy to create something in the same world?
Yes, I actually said that that would be my idea for taking Buffy forward
would to be create a new show in the the universe's rules.
Right. Right.
Only referencing at most what happens in Buffy.
Right. Because we exactly because we have a universe that's been established
that they can use as a basis for all the rules if there's questions going forward.
But at this point, it would be more fun.
And to just start over, not Buffy, it's just in the Buffy universe
or reason the Buffy universe rules, which if you're trying to attract people who
are going to flock to a franchise because of brand loyalty,
they're going to do it whether or not you attach the specific name
Buffy to it, or it can be Buffy, you know, like underscore
and then the actual title of shit.
You know what I mean?
Well, I mean, I'm assuming you're aware of the whole like I talked
to an erotic about this, but I was like, OK, so the reboot Buffy as a major Buffy fan.
I'm like, OK, what do we know?
And it's like, this is all we know.
She's going to be black.
Like, um, what a cool thing to know.
But this is the thing. It's like, OK, I have questions.
So is this does this mean that it's going to be set in the 90s?
It's like, we don't know. She's going to be black.
OK, is this a reboot?
But it's based in modern times.
We don't know. She's going to be black.
I don't. But it's the the shit I
and I think most people don't give a fuck about.
And a new article saying that these kinds of announcements
for all we know would be kind of cool if they were going to do like a
to go along, I guess, with the same kind of stranger things
as aesthetic of setting it in the 90s and recreating the 90s.
That might be neat.
But yeah, there's no information about that.
I mean, whatever.
Have they announced the actor or have they just announced?
No, no, no, no.
They haven't even touched the script.
They just said that it's going to be a black Buffy.
Yeah. So they don't know who they've chosen.
There's no black though. That's important.
Yeah. Which does that not scream to you?
That it's like, hey, we're progressive.
Look at the cool people we are.
And funnily enough, Anita Sarkeesian was one of the many people who said,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
And this is, you know, the argument is that don't reboot Buffy,
but also that there are black slayers.
There already are black slayers.
There already are. Yeah.
Make a show about them.
If that's what you want to do.
Why reboot? Have a character called Buffy.
She's black. It's like, what?
How does that work?
What? Just why not?
Just, yeah, have a new slayer, because guess what?
They're you got plenty to choose from.
What does what does Giles say?
Like early on, the average lifespan of a slayer is like one to two years.
Yeah, it's not long. You've got plenty of freedom.
So Buffy was an extreme anomaly.
Not to mention there's a shit ton of slayers after season seven of Buffy.
There's a shit ton to work with.
If so, if we're talking about if we take this home to modern times,
you're basically talking about having a ton of slayers
that you could choose from.
You could do an X-Men type thing with it almost.
By the way, I like I like being on that side of the argument.
If someone said we're rebooting the buffer universe, we've got a male slayer.
I'd be like, hey, no.
And they'd be like, what do you mean men can't have the power?
I'd be like, no, that's fucked up.
And it's funny, I'd be on that side of the argument.
You know what I mean? Like people, I mean, it's just it's law.
Women are the ones that have the power, not men.
So fuck off. Is that actually canon?
That wasn't a joke.
No, it's women who have it's all based on the idea.
Men absolutely cannot be slayers.
Yeah, they can't be slayers.
What's the what the fuck is the law there?
Funnily enough, you could argue it's have you ever read the manga claymore
or watch the anime?
It's very much of the same premise.
The lore of the slayer is that a bunch of men in cavemen times
were trying to fight demons who were around in cavemen times.
And because they were, you could argue sexist.
I think it's fair.
They injected, slash, like,
forced possession of a demon into a girl
to give her the power of the demon to fight back.
And as a result, it was every time she dies,
the power passes on to another chosen of that generation.
And the chosen part is a little bit vague, but it's always a girl.
Not a guy.
And there's even comments in season seven where it's like,
I think it would be cooler if it was a guy from like one of the one of the guy
characters and it's just like, fucking matter.
That's not how it works.
Exactly.
And I mean, that's that's fine.
It's within the.
Narrative that.
That the thing with.
OK, so we could contrast it with 40 K
and space marines, right?
Only men can become space marines
just because of restrictions on the physiology.
For this reason that I mean, it's that's just
you can still be a debt to serious, but they can't undergo the same,
you know, physiological transformation because only men can survive that.
Yes, stuff about how the process began and who they got the gene seed
stuff from is all only men only make it be space brains.
Exactly. And that's OK.
But it's funny how can you imagine the war?
Can you imagine the Warhammer world isn't really all that fair?
I know he's a war with the absurd bodies
and then there's just girls as well.
And you're like, oh, I thought it was like a muscley.
OK, like, oh, how do you even up that gun?
Like, seriously, it's as big as you are.
Carry on. Yes, go on.
Well, I mean, it's just interesting because it seems to be OK
that in a series like Buffy, like, oh, well, only
there's at least less cake pack to it.
That in Buffy, only women can be slayers.
That's extremely well set up in the lore.
And no one seems to have a problem with that.
For whatever reason, all of a sudden now in 40 K, for example,
well, only men can be space marines.
Well, that's sexist. What?
Let's say that you can't do that on case to case.
Like, you know, does it is there a valid reason for it?
Or is it just? You can't.
Yeah, it's got to make sense.
There's got to be a reason for it.
If there's if there's no reason for it within the lore
and people are saying you can't do this because I feel that way.
OK, that's dumb.
But. I find it odd that the same kind of stuff that has been explained
in media in some instances of excluding.
Females. Is being shut down.
However, stuff that excludes males
is propped up as virtuous.
I find that frustrating.
But that's my opinion, man.
I was waiting for a last J response to like what was going on.
No, man, that's I've talked about it before, but it's it's unequal
rules for the genders.
And you know what they'll do is they'll say
one of the things that they'll complain about.
Is what they say is if you have the ability to create
whatever world you want in literally every choice is arbitrary,
then you have no excuse to not create worlds that are full of equity
and all the genders are equal.
And if you put something like that into your fictional universe,
you're just using that as an excuse to live out your sexism or things like that.
It's all the same crap that we've heard for ages.
Heard for ages what they always bring up.
Well, I was going to.
You have to create world you if you create inequity in a fictional world,
then you have sinned essentially.
You've done a bad thing for Buffy enough.
Only women have the sleigh of power.
And I feel like up until season seven, they were like, you'll be like, why, though?
And season seven, they're like, fuck, we better answer this question.
It's just the way we better answer it.
I would say arguably, which is is funny, is that although we're told
and and shown how powerful the slayer is,
we're also very much shown.
More so than we're told, how powerful witches and wizards are.
Yes, yes. You know, slayers are outclassed by magic users in the buff universe.
Yes, which is illustrated, but not explicitly stated, because again,
it's like all the slayers, the only one who can defeat this stuff.
But it's like, whoa, have you taken a look at any of these magic?
Buffy explicitly says that Willow is the most powerful person they have.
So I'd like to think that that's basically definitive.
But even that's but even that whole thing is gender equal,
because Gyles is like the most powerful warlock.
Outside of Willow, who's ridiculously broken.
So, yeah, I think that even that one's pretty fair.
Um, at least in Buffy.
Yeah, it's just that there's this one thing.
That that is exclusively female.
And then there's the thing I would defend it and they'd be like,
but you're supposed to be sexist.
And I'm like, I'm sorry, that's just what the law says.
I've never actually cared about women power, men power.
It's always just been how it works rule wise.
I think that's sort of my I'm loyal to.
And it's even if you want to say like, you know, Buffy,
that, oh, Buffy's a feminist kind of thing,
which I think you could potentially argue.
Again, I would say that outside of Willow, the the strongest.
Warlock, such witch.
Is Giles.
Well, so who saves the day in Buffy season seven?
Who wins the war overall? It's Jill.
Even though it's an army of girls from Trump,
but it's someone with interesting hair color choices.
I will give you that.
Holdo.
Yeah, I was going to say that.
Welcome back, everybody.
We're just discussing TV shows as you do.
Crazy suggestion, by the way. No.
OK. What was your suggestion?
So eventually, not not necessarily right away,
but maybe eventually to get to the sixth super chat.
Oh, see, I think that's racist.
You don't see that as racist, Jay?
I am above such things.
I was like, you're a descendant of such things.
Sounds that's a very white thing to say.
That sounds like a very white racism.
No one's above racism, especially not a white.
Well, I don't know.
Do you not identify as white?
Well, I mean, you don't you don't know that I am white,
just that I look white.
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking what you identify as.
I'm asking for your pronouns.
Um, white is white is a pronoun.
Yes. Yeah.
I'm clearly not up to not up to date with the lingo.
White and when.
Um, since we've started a new stream,
I'm going to suggest that we we engage in memes.
Oh, yes. Oh, yeah, you said that we have video memes
as well as picture memes.
This is the only way to the to the watch together in case
anybody is left like a giant massive such as raggers.
You have now the ability to read joy or an
ability to read, read joy or read and read joy or a different.
Read. Yeah, we got we got some memes.
Everyone is everyone ready for the plan.
No, it's not playing at all. It's poor.
No, I just had to pause it.
Well, let's watch together being a man comes at.
So here's our first effect meme of the day.
This video format. Here we go.
It comes at you with surprising potency hits you with a jolt
and leaves you both hot and cold at the same time,
just like the jump scare that's about to appear at the end of the sentence.
One point two.
Oh, yeah.
Without reference, this is a nonsensical meme.
Hashtag, we were there.
Billion. Billion.
This is called retain of the fucking Spooder Wars.
Oh, another. Oh, my God, it's back.
So this is what he found.
Fifty two was was reduced to
Disney taking over it, which funnily enough, one guy in your comments
who decided to destroy your channel.
Right. Yeah, he thought he was responsible.
It's not totally on the box.
This is the funny thing is the dizzy old Star Wars.
This is the Star Wars soundtrack.
This could totally be taken down by this video.
Being sad about the fact that it's taken down by copyright.
That's why I'm pausing while also reducing the volume.
How about that?
But yes, Disney are evil overlords.
We hate them. Yep.
But I'm I'm I'm going to.
Oh, no, look at that.
Back to Spooder Wars.
Back to Spooder Wars.
This ends now.
Last time on Spooder Wars.
I see this is an absolute win.
Number 11, please.
God, make it stop. Make it.
And we will eat both your arms and then both of your legs.
And then we will eat your face right off your head.
So so if anyone's not following Spooderman wants to.
He may have had a case any following along with this.
He may have issues with me slash the stream.
But ultimately, the idea that Disney would take it down as a whole.
That is not acceptable to Spooderman.
No, he plans to eat Mickey.
What is your word?
It venom was a weird.
That is only where I was actually about to.
The venom is weird as fuck.
I kind of hate it and kind of love it at the same time.
Who who here saw venom in full? I did.
I guess. Yeah.
Rags, did you see it?
I have not seen don't see it.
No, it's not worth it.
It's a weird one.
I saw it with Alex and his girlfriend.
And funnily enough, the first comment out of the three of us was from here
saying, man, they deleted a lot of scenes from that film.
And she'd drawn that from the fact that there's so much missing scenes
in terms of continuity is broken to the point where you're like,
I'm pretty sure we're missing a scene.
I think we jumped a few men.
Why would they do that?
How how weird is that as a criticism, though?
Yes, it's pretty.
It's if people are walking out of your movie, no. Yeah.
That's that's yeah, I've heard that.
I've heard it's I've heard like good and bad.
But I've heard from people who are.
Not subject to the that it is to me, as you may know,
it's going to be carnage.
Ringy has said he enjoys it.
Didn't they bring in like a totally new director like halfway through?
That sounds like something they would do.
I was going to say that sounds normal, but it shouldn't be normal.
What's it's like when you look like Han Solo and stuff?
Oh, I know.
Solo so many of these movies now, they have to like constantly change
the directing staff.
So it makes sense then why stuff looks so disjointed.
And when you watch it as the viewer, you go, what the fuck?
What were you doing here?
And you can tell that things have been cut up because basically
they're trying to just edit everything together and post
and making it make sense.
I'll tell you what I'm a sword wielding kangaroo bitch.
So Shad was resurrected in eight.
I guess that is the continuity, OK?
Oh, God, this is a thing.
Chad lives. What film is this footage from?
Kangaroo Jack. Yeah, Kangaroo Jack.
Australia is fake, fake.
Spoodles far from over, far from over.
And so I'm glad that happened.
So this is called the obligatory steamed efap meme.
I have no idea how much I'm going to pause on this
because I don't even know where I should, but it's I've seen half of it.
It's fantastic. Here we go.
Well, I made it despite directions.
Hello there, ladies and gentlemen.
I hope you're prepared for remembering.
So I'm a huge Simpsons fan.
Upon seeing this episode, as much as any Simpsons fan,
we never expected this to become a huge meme.
She's memes. Yeah.
I don't even know why.
Like what it was.
They put Super Chats into the fucking ice.
What the fuck?
Ruined a discord for a good thing.
And as much as that sucks, how about we talk about Star Wars?
I want to congratulate anybody who takes all of the congratulate
the all of the congratulate the clips and tins them into an actual narrative.
That's amazing.
Ooh. Delightfully.
And I can let this play because this isn't copyrighted.
How wonderful is that?
Aidan, if you haven't seen this, it's wonderful.
Yeah, that's awesome.
That's crazy.
Mola, her.
I mean,
you know, I mean,
like Raspy, the wolf is Peter Ritz.
Why is there smoke?
Moller.
Oh, that isn't smoke.
It's steam.
We're going to be doing that today and it's going to be fun on the phone.
OK. Downton.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you're ready for a mouthwatering memes.
I thought it was mouthwatering memes.
Your response?
Don't know.
I said steamed memes.
That's what I call hamburgers.
You call memes steamed hams.
Oh, that's just silly.
Ah, what's silly in Lost Jedi?
Really?
Well, I'm from YouTube and I've never heard anyone use the phrase steamed memes.
Oh, no, I didn't say that.
How did you do this?
Did you find the little elephant clips?
He's eating a geode, the geode, geode.
You know, memes are quite similar to the J's geode.
Oh, no.
That means old family recipe for steamed memes.
Yes. Yes.
And you call them steamed memes, despite the fact that you know,
Yeah, I know what that is.
Excuse me for one second.
Oh, well, that was fantastic.
That time was head by all I'm pooped.
Yes, I should be.
Good Lord.
That's Goliath.
Goliath.
Goliath.
At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country,
localized entirely within your Discord.
Yep, yep.
No, no, die on the shitter.
Oh, wait, what was that?
I want to see that again.
Die on the shitter.
Oh, you are an odd fellow, but I must say, you're a good ham.
Idiot.
Idiot.
That was fucking brilliant.
We've got a we've got a steamed Habs meme for eFap and it's perfect.
Oh, my goodness.
I didn't have Discord up the whole time.
That's embarrassing, but it doesn't matter because you hit it.
Oh, was that not on the screen?
Well, they could hear us.
They couldn't see our faces lighting up.
That's because I'm drunk.
Okay, I was worried that the meme wasn't on the screen.
Oh, no.
The meme was on the screen.
They could see the meme.
But yes, meme.
Sorry, that's not meme.
That was 10 Haku.
That was wonderful.
Thank you.
We enjoyed it very much.
So this is called, I don't think I ever played this.
It was before it was actually made before the Spider-Man home
coming debate, and it's called my humble predictions for the home
coming debate.
You know, I think that you guys are more than reasonably in a camp
that's like, yeah, homecoming roof, not so great, but like we're in
the complete opposite.
We're like, how could you think this isn't a great film?
I'm confused.
So it's just there's a huge clash is going to happen there.
I imagine.
Yes.
Well, see, I'll be ready.
I'll be ready because I have very strong feelings about that film.
Very strong feelings about that film.
You can still like the content.
You can still feel whatever you look at this stop asserting that it
is logically written when it is proven.
They're citing myself upon this idea that you can dislike it.
You can't assert that it's illogically written, which in fairness
to Nidrotic.
I don't think he ever argued that it was illogically written.
I just yeah, it was just any logical standard.
Don't you know who I am?
We'll see.
I'll be ready.
I'll be ready.
For the record, I'm on very good terms with Gary and I think you
would find this amusing.
It's just silly.
Yeah.
And then this was made I guess post Spider-Man go ahead.
What?
Hang on.
It's the hang on.
Sorry.
Is that Illidan or Malkanis?
I'm getting them confused.
Is what?
Is that Illidan or Malkanis?
Illidan, Stormrage.
Good.
Okay.
I was right.
I think it matters though, Jay.
I have to agree with Rags.
You're a bad person for even suggesting that it does matter.
I never suggested that.
Gated.
All right.
So here we go.
This is another meme.
This is the Simpsons meme and it's unbiased homecoming court.
I will no longer follow you.
You're a dishonorable leader.
You're a bad man.
You have the baptism.
I denounce you.
You're a that sort of thing.
Why are we talking about Spider-Man?
Final part of Star Wars trilogy is coming.
We're going to see how Anakin falls to the dark side and how
the Republic falls.
Slown old poke.
Slown old poke, yes.
Slown old poke.
When James Moore hears that there's an efap about to start, but
he just uses last pocket change to buy a first world country.
Oh hell, let's just do it.
We always do.
Hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.
Goodism.
All right.
This is called a healthy reaction from a person of sound mind
and then slash s if you guys are aware of what that indicates.
Oh.
Sexual harassment.
She's that's actually from the boys.
I believe.
And it's the is a Superman like character who is not considered
great in terms of morality and the brown table would very much
be this character if he was asked on to a date in any way shape
or form by a male and I think that meme illustrates it perfectly.
This one old efap meme brown table decimates the toxic brood
and it's spelt on my in a different.
Don't let a single one get away.
Video game cutscenes mean I don't have to pause.
Oh, thank God.
Sexual arrest take down about 10 still your fear.
It's now or never.
We'll win this.
I know we will.
Super Smash Brothers on safe.
Is it ultimate?
Who's a bro?
Can you win in it?
It might be ultimate.
Spider saw the future.
Unlike Superman.
There's no day slide.
Who wrote sexual harassment?
I was wiping everyone out sexual harassment.
Nobody says a chance of harassment harassment harassment.
Sexual harassment.
My God, it's like everybody.
Sexual harassment should be in stoic wooden.
Dancing.
Gonna get tonal.
That is the question.
Oh, no, don't run.
If I can shoot laser beams out of my hands that guy would be toast.
Stay tuned to see how tonal survives.
Watch out for this man.
Somebody eat this man.
Wait, I want to see what happened to tonal.
I need it.
You have no idea how much I unironically want total to save the rest of us total.
You can do it.
We believe in you.
So unfortunately, we've got to eat this man.
One of them extensive memes.
But this is one that I feel like I'm absolutely getting hit with copyright for because it's basically a complete repurpose of a Doctor Who episode.
Or Doctor Who like the BBC loves copyright striking.
I'll do what I can but this is probably gonna get stricken.
So just if it does like just wait.
Okay, guys, it'll come out eventually the first episode.
We just did tonight that'll come out easy because there's nothing to copyright as far as I'm aware this one less so but hey, it'll be fine.
It's them aliens.
I'll bet my pension read the subtitles.
I guess to make it make more sense.
What's his name?
Jay Green Massives Wilfred Wilfred and Sylvia next to him.
You want this time?
You want this time you green swine.
Look, you get back inside Sylvia.
They always want the women.
They always want the British.
Oh, dad.
Just look.
Oh, my God.
Look at the sky.
This is a season for the thing.
Yeah, this is season for right.
Yeah.
Gonna like talk over it.
What was it feel bad because he's actually a milkman.
Yes, it makes sense.
I'm the milkman.
My milk is delicious.
Yes.
Oh, there's rags.
Oh, you can play by Rose.
Who's a girl?
Poker right now, milker.
I remember this.
I remember watching it up to date and being like, oh, my God.
This is such a major event.
Having Rose teleported while the world is falling apart.
Jay, do you remember caring about this?
Yeah, it was great.
It was great.
I was like, I must have.
You don't see the day the bad man, the gay, the bad man, Captain Marvel.
This is totally all right.
Now, this is probably 100% copyrightable.
Fat.
To say like everyone, like when you guys make these mean, you got to understand that if
it's copyrightable, we got to do this.
Yeah, and I get that it makes it less funny to pause.
There's literally no other option.
I actually didn't.
What was the day you're more of an expert and Aiden to a degree, I believe.
I don't know how much you know about Doctor Who, but people have felt the intro was damaged
at one point in terms of changes because they change it every season, right?
So not every season.
The audio was out of sync the intro on all of the episodes after like episode five of
season one.
Yeah, the audio was out of sync.
I'm going to keep playing it while you talk to pass through the copyright.
Okay, there's a right at that clip where the TARDIS like zips through and it spins around
the TARDIS as a whoosh that plays at the wrong time.
And it's like, you know, that's how you can tell.
I just remember that.
I remember that because I was I was into the threads and the conversation about Doctor
Who and I remember that it was in Matt Smith's era.
There was an intro that happened that pissed everyone off.
I never got pissed off about that one.
It looked really not.
I don't remember being the first one.
I remember being eventually within.
Yeah, it could have been that one.
It looks really cheap, but I didn't mind it personally.
They put so much effort into image masking all of these memes and I can't play them in
their glory.
I have to play them and pause them.
It's horrible.
Look at this all these moving and increasing in size according to how Paul said they were
taking the critics.
Look at this effort.
I know what's about to happen to you in this scene.
I know what's happened to you.
I remember this.
It's actually the art.
Isn't it the origin of the hand that we looked at?
It is the origin of the hand.
Rags, you're about to learn some shit.
Oh my.
Oh, yeah, this relates back to the torch.
Would we?
Yes, it does, Jay.
Yes.
The origin of the hand.
This is the payoff of the hand.
Yes.
Well, no, it's the origin.
Why would it be the payoff?
No, no, no, no.
The origins when his hand gets chopped off.
Yeah, you said it would be.
It's not the origin.
It's the payoff.
Yeah, this is the payoff.
This is the origin.
No.
No, his hand gets chopped off way earlier than this.
No, it's after this.
No, his hand gets chopped off in his fucking first episode season.
Like the Christmas special.
I thought you like.
Okay, wait, remind me.
What does he channel his regeneration Tism's into?
Into his hand.
That's the payoff to that.
And it makes him a clone that goes back with Rose, right?
That's how that works.
Yes.
Okay, you got me.
All right.
My daughter who Tism's on as good as your Tism.
I submit.
Well, this is a beautiful scene of you being reunited with Rags.
Well, what I will say is it's really contrived.
Like it's cute that these two reunite.
But the fucking Dalek is just like, oh, they just didn't notice him until now.
Like I could have been done a lot worse.
Oh, absolutely.
Why was that clip just in there like this?
So Rags picture.
We've been separated for how long is it Jay?
Like two years, three years.
Wow.
I can't imagine a week without you.
Okay.
Okay, right.
There are okay for the context though.
There are Daleks fucking everywhere.
Like the contrivance is that they haven't thought of that.
Not that a Dalek shows up.
Just how long have they been separated?
That's the important part.
Yes, like a very long time for him.
It's going to be longer for him.
It's going to be like because he has adventures off screen.
He's like right.
It is for viewers.
It's three years and then others to you know, it's two seasons for viewers.
I'm not sure how many okay.
So Rags picture.
We were separate literally you were I or you were pulled into a different dimension
and we couldn't speak to each other for two years.
And this is the first time we see each other.
Okay, that's that's what's happening here.
All right.
Well, I wonder if you the Dalek is going to be very emotional.
The huge moment that we're finally able to say hi to each other again.
And I have to pause it because that's already enough to make copy bots go nuts.
This movie is a fucking mess.
Majorly arrives at this very moment Rags.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, no.
Yeah, he arrives.
And he decides to shoot me.
And then free teleports in and destroys majorly.
See what I mean about the whole like oh, oh, you just oh, come on.
I would have shut up.
Is there just no reason for that to Jack?
I don't remember.
I just remember being like man, the Dalek just happened to show up and then Jack happened
to show up after the Dalek happening to show up isn't that isn't contrived at all because
they're fucking all over.
Well, he's only one of them, but they happen to hit him at the emotional peak.
You've got to admit that's a little bit.
Yeah, it is a bit contrived, but like it's it's not bad.
Like it's not as bad as anything by Steven Moffat or Chris Chibnall.
Here we are.
Chris Chibnall is awful.
Steven Moffat has his peaks in his lows.
His valleys.
Sure.
You know that hang on.
Do you aware of the episode?
Are you aware of the fact that in Doctor Who canon now the moon is an egg?
Yes, and is it a dragon is born from it or yeah, a dragon hatches out of the moon.
I think I saw that episode.
I don't remember, but it's dumb, but in continuity, right?
There's a moon base built in like 2070 or something.
So they can't just get rid of the moon and say it hatches the moon now.
So as soon as the creature hatches from the egg, it lays an identical egg.
It is now the new moon.
It's the dumbest shit.
I hate it.
Makes sense.
You're also that that entire episode is a metaphor for pro life.
I believe.
Is is interesting into resting.
I will give you that.
He says Rose, but it sounds kind of like you could believe it's me saying rags under breathy.
I could.
Yes, I can sound like Rose.
I remember this being intense though, because this means so rags.
If you didn't know the doctor as a character whenever he sustains mortal damage, he must regenerate which turns it into a different person altogether and people really like David Tennant.
And so the idea of him turning into another person is bad and even Rose is on board with this.
She's like, no, no, no, no, no, don't turn into another person.
You're I really like you this way.
Okay, just knowing how his fucking arc and so it would have been so much better just the end of this was this regeneration.
This would be better.
You're referring to when the master becomes a crazy person.
Yes, that's fucking all which is just after the waters of Mars, which is a shame, isn't it?
Yeah.
Wait, Rose is saying that the subtitles say that Jay is saying that, but Jay.
Oh, no, wait.
Sorry, you're playing.
Don't Donna saying that.
Yeah, Donnie.
You're right.
Donna kebab Donna doesn't know about regeneration.
Right.
Sorry, but but Jack does.
Why in this narrative would Jay be unaware?
He's the doctor who fans is this is broken my immersion.
Jay.
What can I do broken law?
I apologize.
They should be Jack.
What do you mean?
Donna should be Ringy.
That would make more sense because Ringy would have no fucking clue what doctor who is.
I'm hugely critical of efap memes.
I'll tell you that much.
Yeah, this was the only time where it's been Hugh.
Well, I say this as if I've watched it all.
This is this is probably the most significant is ever been because people are more attached to David Tennant's doctor than pretty much any other doctor in history.
Like well, it's talk.
Come on, Jay.
Don't give me that shit people fucking adored him.
I remember having to look through comment sections being like he should have been the doctor forever.
I remember having to look through comment sections of people predicting he would be the 12th and then 13th doctor.
Like he's just going to come back to be another member when they said that Christopher Eggleston.
David Tennant and Matt Smith was supposed to have an episode but Christopher Eggleston disagreed and didn't want to do it.
And so they had to bring in John.
Well, I was going to say the 9th doctor.
Is it the 10th or 9th?
I think it was the 9th.
Chris Freckleston is the 9th but they brought in John Hurt instead and he's the war doctor the one that came before.
Yeah, yeah, it doesn't that the fucking that breaks cannon though.
Anyway, as in it can it makes more sense.
Does it though?
Jay, can you explain that it does?
Because we know in the 9th doctor's first episode that he's just regenerated.
So it wouldn't make sense for him to still be the 9th doctor and not have ended the time war yet because the time it starts with a time war.
It starts with like him being fresh and the time war is already over.
So it he ended it before he became the 9th doctor.
The time war ended.
I remember that was kind of retcon.
They had to show it was it was retconny.
But not in ways that didn't make sense.
Like it retcon previous events, but in a time travel show where that can happen.
I mean, I'm only really trying to delay.
I'm like, yeah, it did.
It did shove him in, but like it didn't break cannon.
It was a retcon though.
I really like John.
It was a doctor.
That's okay.
Rip John here.
He was a really good actor.
Pretty weird to think that he was the guy from Alien.
A lot of people were like, oh, that was the guy from Alien.
He explodes.
Yes.
Bitch, I gotta I gotta live.
Yeah.
Even though he kind of doesn't know.
And I always saw it as like a cop-out to prevent the Iranian leadership.
I was thinking like, well, him getting shot is kind of Russell T Davis's choice as well.
So it doesn't.
Yeah, it's like well, it's it's a bait.
This is just a bait.
Isn't it?
Yes, true.
But it's also to try and get you rose a happy ending, right?
It also creates this the other doctor to be fair alternate dimensions.
Doctor.
The Metacrisis doctor is what he's not.
I didn't know that.
It's not the sound effects they had for the original for that.
Yes.
Yes.
My goodness.
I didn't know.
Wow.
Part 2 will be out when I get around to making it.
If you like Doctor Who related content, check out my channel at Editron.
Thanks for watching.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hello.
Hey.
Hi.
There you go.
Three hellos.
I like that we had Jay here to translate Doctor Who tismary.
What's this related video?
Oh, no.
One is more efap memes.
More efap memes.
Efap memes.
What?
I didn't even get a chance to say my plan.
Your plan.
You know who else had a plan?
Please don't say Hitler.
Adolf Hitler.
Apparently, Geeks and Gamers have had raided us with waffle memes and I didn't acknowledge
Geeks was too distracted by Doctor Who.
Thank you, Jeremy.
What is this happening now?
Weak waffle memes.
It did happen.
And it was my bad that I didn't notice.
Yes.
Do you like waffles?
Do you like waffles?
They're like pancakes with syrup holders.
No, that's the wrong side.
Milton.
Milton.
Milton?
Milton to the design of the breakfast food.
Has they even gone to sleep again?
I think that Aiden might have slipped away into sleep if I buy land.
It truly shows the power of efap that we can survive two sleep cycles.
Oh, that happened already in the 24-hour one.
Brew.
But those were...
Brew.
Those were true.
I was just sent this one.
It's called sneak peek efap wolf versus rags and then it says scissors.
Wolf, scissors, rags.
You were saying it's a scissors and everyone was like, what are you talking about?
Look, that's not incorrect.
Well, no one says it that way though.
Yeah, well, it's not correct.
They need to get with the old times.
That's me, OG rags.
Talk about scissors like the good old days.
How do they pronounce scissors?
This isn't scissors.
Holy shit, that's weekend warriors.
That all the way back in like efap 3 something.
Yeah, man, this is taking it back.
This is some old efap shit.
Yeah, scissors.
Yeah.
Well, it wasn't the contention that it was like...
But he said A, scissors.
Okay, listen, we can have...
You notice that me rags don't see this scene the same way as all of you guys do.
This discussion again, I don't fucking know.
The point is that if I take my pants and I cut them down the middle...
Yes, I will give it to you.
Once you guys see...
Oh, I don't have...
Do I have a pant and then another pant?
And I put together and they become pants?
Or do I have half pants?
You have two halves of pants.
So by this logic rags wins, right?
Of course.
Absolutely.
I always win.
You have two halves of a pair of pants.
Also, I have no idea what Filmora 9 is, but apparently it lets you do this.
It's a free software and it has a mighty watermark on it.
Yes, it does.
That is a mighty watermark.
So you have a pant.
It's like a pair of pants.
The pant is...
I can't see Gandalf spinning on the floor with that.
You don't understand.
You need the contact.
But they're connected at the top.
They're in pants like short for like...
So now if you have two pairs of pants...
You say I have a pair of a pair of pants.
So if you have two...
It's worth it.
This final one is a video game, I believe.
So that means I can play it all.
It's from Mr. Eman Gameplay himself.
It is called Emperor Mauler of the Efap Empire.
Sorry, I need to read this out for people who don't want to win.
Massive, 17 plus.
There's strong amounts of rhino milk.
I impact objectivity.
Intensitism, memes.
Got to watch out for that objectivity.
Use of elevator music and Tonald and Imrax.
You need to be aware of this.
Oh, this is with meme repository as well.
JXC management.
I am Mauler.
And I was born into this world.
Just like you.
But with a nation of men...
The sound editing is so good.
The bastion of hope and courage.
The Empire.
There's no way to appreciate how much effort's gone into this.
I'm sorry.
We just can't play it and laugh.
It's amazing.
This looks great.
Take mine.
Come on, let's try it.
Give it this.
Now.
We unite.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Now, you underestimate the fight
to purge the evil that dare come at us.
Follow me
and we will punish this darkness.
I swear this as your Emperor.
Like if m rattly
You gotta defend yourself against them themes
I don't know if theo would be comfortable with the idea that moviebob defeats him.
We would have to see if he could come on in.
Jim Sterling.
There's no reason not to bomb Rhyno.
Riding Rhyno.
Where could this just sound good?
Most people do not know what a wyvern is.
Holy shit.
Most people don't know what a wyvern is.
No total no.
It seems impossible to watch movies wrong, but you're watching movies wrong.

But I'm waiting for the conclusion of the efap saga with the epic like night style battle
where like, you know, all of the Avengers appear.
Well, like someone who fully edit.
And we all die and it's a nice little inning.
What you want us all to die?
What's that about?
I mean no.
That's not what happened.
What the fuck?
Why are you
No, he's not.
Well, he doesn't die in the battle.
He dies after the end of the battle.
Do you guys, I don't know if you knew this, but, um, when season eight, episode six aired,
the shot of, of Daenerys with a dragon behind her with her wing, the wings spread out.
Yeah.
That stupid fucking shot.
Yeah.
And people were like, this shot is so good.
This should be shown in any film class.
I kind of find it funny that they'd say that, but the nostalgia critic one.
Good reference.
Um, this is in reference to the fact that the thumbnails are being changed from YouTube.
I made this.
You made this.
I made this.
I guess this is, um, you got real criticism, I think round table and you say the captain
moment, your sexual harassment, which has managed to really survive the memes.
It's oh yeah.
Sexual harassment is, oh, that's a good one.
It just shows you can't, can't get rid of sexual harassment.
So easy.
Unbeatable.
As they say.
Um, hello, Greedo escaped the fap memes by questioning the validity and bring whether
or not they were, what was it?
Sorry.
What did you think massive was?
Are you calling me Jamaican?
That was it.
Yeah.
I mean, Jamaican escaped such things.
Um, this was sent to me on, on Twitter and I'm so drunk that I didn't get to really reference
it to, I don't get to vet very well.
What is this?
General black.
I don't know.
I think it might have something to do with the Star Wars.
Probably Star Wars related.
I will give you that.
General black.
Is this just like a, like a new one that we don't, we can't remember because we're too
inebriated.
Yes.
But there's so many things that get referenced.
Like I don't, what's the reference here that Han Solo was black.
I can't remember what, what, what, what's this referencing?
Who is that?
Well, that is, that is the guy who plays home manga, Tismong, War manga, Killmonger, Killmonger
and Creed.
And he is on the head.
He's the head of Han Solo.
And I can't remember what we said.
I'm pretty sure this reference is something we said.
I've just, my memory is so bad right now.
Hey, super chat person.
I never said no characters die in end game.
I said no characters, final battle, which technically is true because he dies after
the battle.
Oh, the split hairs.
Well it's still true though.
If he died seconds after he ended the battle, that's not part of that.
Also, are you hearing Aiden, Aiden sleeping?
Can you hear that?
Everyone somewhere?
Yeah.
What's the sound?
What is the sound?
He is just out like a, out like a light.
Every once in a while you can hear the breathing.
Bitch, it's in your area.
That's what I wanted to see.
Someone pay to get that on Pornhub.
See, but if she's, if she's got, if she's got the apparatus to hear us, surely we'd
disturb her just by talking, but apparently not.
Just be quiet for a while and then suddenly, give her a sec, we want to make sure everyone
can hear her, her, and then no noise, like her breath or something.
Best guest ever.
The green light is flickering.
There it was.
I heard that for a second.
She's sleeping.
She's sleeping.
It's all, it's all good.
She'll wake up again.
Someone will wake her up and she will be in halfway through eFap and things.
So this is the boys where character is using a super powered baby that has eye laces and
I guess Quinton Reviews is using it to attack people.
Totally beyond fucked up.
This is eFap when looking at Quinton Video.
Literally anything else.
I can't remember who made it, it's the same attitude towards it.
Movie Bob, who's the person that we also get really bored of really quick?
I can't remember.
It's not Movie Bob.
It's, um.
Hello Greedo.
That was it.
Hello Greedo.
Hello Greedo.
Yeah.
Hello Greedo.
You get distracted a lot with Hello Greedo.
He is just so dull.
Okay.
I have not liked slash seen this film.
Literally everyone else.
You what?
Okay.
Ah shit.
Here we go again.
Here we go again.
Yeah.
It's not, it shouldn't be a shock at this point.
A good old fashioned rags meme for Horny Zone.
Horny Zone.
Horny Zone.
I don't, um, I'm trying to, I need to figure this one out.
So got other mods are using Theo to drive memes.
Theo's doing all the work putting all the memes in eFap memes maybe.
I think that must be it.
Yeah.
Look at this Theo.
In a sense.
This is another one.
Mola showing Batman extract fan art.
The chat.
I mean, I gotta show what's there.
Okay.
I can't just not show it.
It would be racist to not show certain ones and show certain ones.
Okay.
Um.
Again, this is one to be deciphered.
We've got, I guess, couldn't refuse his death.
Saying, guess who to Aiden paladin.
He only sent it to sleep.
He didn't, he didn't kill her.
She's fine.
She'll wake up again.
You believe that.
She's going to wake up twice during all of eFap.
And then this is me.
She's going to wake up twice during eFap and we're still going.
Wondering what a lobster means in the flag.
What does the lobster mean?
Wonderful.
Uh, I guess this is the, uh,
three flags battling it out.
Who will win?
The dragon lobster.
The legs just.
Oh my goodness.
Fucking great.
So I know you guys haven't seen Memento,
but those who have will appreciate this.
Don't believe his lies.
Jay can't counter this.
Once I've written that, that means you lie a lot.
Oh no.
You should see Memento though.
It's a really unconventional movie.
I might watch it.
To give you the hook.
It's played backwards.
You watch it backwards.
Whoa.
I fear no man, but that thing.
It is genuinely terrifying.
In his own way.
Yeah.
This is my fucking favorite meme.
So fucking man like shit.
I am drunk.
Well, that doesn't change the truth.
Simp.
Sons.
Um,
make sure we actually, I'm actually running into memes here.
Uh,
I guess a Dr.
Who meme, which is pretty relevant.
Used to be just me and ranks.
But now we've got.
In rags Buffy on the TV.
Hey, he's chilling out.
It can't you can argue that Fringy is spawning Goliath there.
Oh man.
Oh, don't say that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh man.
Oh, don't say that as deep.
You got Bilbo and cosmic chicken on the horizon.
Um, I guess I want to say that's J either preparing for battle with or battling with somebody
with a sword.
Was that sad?
Could be sad.
That's probably.
He's probably training you.
So much going on.
So much law.
It's great.
Who's that?
Who's that in the sea?
No idea.
Ringwraith.
They don't like water.
We need to see this.
Jesus.
It needs to be seen.
Oh my goodness.
It's like a resident evil boss.
Oh my goodness.
I guess what the weeks are so uncomfortable.
Oh yes.
It's horrifying to say the least.
I'm genuinely if any game devs are watching.
Please make this happen.
This is, um, I forget who said it, but they were like, you think it's bad to have a really
terrible flag.
This is like a pub.
I guess the culture or something.
Take out.
I don't know how you just.
That's so artsy.
It's so it speaks to me.
I'm just such a deep level.
It's so artsy fartsy.
It's it's something I give you that I don't know what to really call it, but it's something.
Another meme.
Post.
Lunch, sweetie.
Math teacher.
I look down and like a boy, chicken and Simpsons.
Isn't any letter P hiding in the Simpsons.
I'm a disgrace to the class.
The little pig.
I just didn't know.
Okay.
Shad was teaching me and we interrupted it.
And I guess this is the last one.
And since I'm so out of my mind, I don't know what justification slash context is.
I guess Ryan Johnson hates all of the people.
Which is me.
Jeff.
That's Star Wars girl.
Some gamers.
That's Jeremy.
Jesse's.
Ethan.
He wants to kill all of us.
Oh, no.
Which is only natural is.
We're not a huge fan.
Handle the bands.
Which means.
I'm back to Superchats now.
Okay.
Ready.
We're back to the Superchats, everybody.
I know three hours ago we started.
But this time will be different.
Yes.
All right.
All right.
So the next the first one of this stream to address is you guys doing good.
Yeah.
I'm doing pretty good.
Yeah.
I'm well.
I'm good.
Oh, wait.
Is this episode fifty four dash two or like episode fifty four episode fifty five.
Oh, a whole new episode.
I mean, it took us one hour to get to Superchats.
We've already got a whole bunch of content by the logic.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Gracious apps in one day.
We spoil.
We send Aiden to sleep twice.
It's an achievement.
Technically, this is over two days.
Yeah.
This is Aiden X.
Dr.
Lehman forever.
I'm guessing they have maybe a thing.
I do not know.
Dr.
Lehman.
Yeah.
Yeah.
YouTube.
I wasn't aware of that.
That's a name that I understand in a different context.
Money for more but critique for Jay.
You do realize that some precautions called for by prominent politicians for climate change include elimination of air travel and farting cows.
I agree with you on climate change, but your tweet was extremely reductive.
Almost dishonestly so.
You spend time on a fat making people for reductiveness.
Come on, man.
Yeah.
It was funny.
Remind me.
What was your tweet again?
Some shit about like.
I'd just rather take the risk of not all dying and just trust that climate change is probably a problem.
Oh, right.
It was like we should do things to evade it even if it's not a real thing because that's not what I said.
That's one hundred and ten thousand percent what you said.
I'm not even convinced climate change is actually going to be really.
For us.
You go, Jay.
Look at that silence.
It doesn't matter what you do.
It's China and India.
Don't give a fuck.
Yeah, that's the very concerning piece of data.
You're saying, Jay?
No.
Well, I.
Save some cash from Hawaii.
Can go to meet Vic Mignona.
John Rhys Davis, who plays Gimli and had dinner with Mindy Sterling and comic comic artist Jeremy Clark.
That was awesome.
There's Mindy Sterling.
No idea.
I would have to Google Lindsay Sterling Mindy.
Oh, there's not a name I hear anymore.
Mindy feels like an old name.
One of them old names.
Some of the chat says Jay wants some Greta Milk.
We'll be honest, do you want Greta Milk?
Some Greta Milk?
Oh, no.
Not not right now.
Thanks.
No.
X-Wings can't navigate without an R2 unit.
How did Luke get to the planet in the first place?
No R2 unit on the island and no R2 in the submerged X-Wing.
It makes zero sense.
Um, we have to assume how to get there anyway, I guess.
I don't remember navigation to navigate the universe like R2 units.
Yeah, they're definitely supposed to be compatible, like super compatible to the point where you should have one for every X-Wing.
But I can't remember them saying you cannot navigate without one.
But maybe I'd have to I'd have to check.
Interesting.
Um, am I actually seeing Quinton in the thumbnail and Aidan Paladin as a guest?
This isn't real.
I died and went to Efap Heaven.
Also, hi, frags.
You did.
Hello!
Welcome to Efap Heaven.
Yeah, I know.
This is Efap Heaven Plus now, where the bonus happens.
She's in Efap Dreamland for some of us.
Mm-hmm.
Have any of you seen the Netflix original Polar?
No.
Polar?
But I hardly know her.
I was going to say, I have not seen it.
If I'm wrong, if I'm not wrong, that stars Mads Mikkelsen.
Yes.
I believe he is in it.
I don't know.
I did. Never heard of it.
I've not seen it, unfortunately.
Uh, Rags, watched your craft anti-gamer.
Yo!
My brain hurt.
Yeah, that's going back a bit.
But yeah, man, that was a bad one.
Have to defend the world's most depressed minority, gamers.
Gamers rise up.
That was a good thing to write back to.
Jay, gamers rise up, okay?
We live in a society.
We do live in a society.
Gamers rise up.
I want to see Joker, but it wasn't out yet.
And I blame society.
Society fucked you up.
Morla, let me ask you something, Passafilly.
I could care less about your answer, but is water wet?
You already know this.
I vote yes.
Rags votes no.
There was a whole thing about it.
Aiden, thoughts on adoption.
Don't freak our high doggy.
I think that was supposed to be don't freak out and then high doggy.
Hello!
I will unironically just simply ask Aiden that if she comes back.
I will ask her thoughts on adoption, but only if she comes back.
Now that you're back, what are your thoughts on adoption?
It's not because the common thing that's going around is the whole pro-life, pro-choice thing.
It's just like pro-odd adoption.
She's just going to be like, what the fuck?
Answer the question, Aiden.
I agree with you on climate change, but your tweet was extremely reductive.
Oh, sorry. That's the second half.
Yeah, I read ahead.
Where can I watch Rags and Aiden play Pathfinder?
Pathfinder.
That is streamed on Knuckle-a-V's channel.
How do you spell that?
Knuckle-a-V.
I believe it is.
Let me see.
N-U-C-K-E-L-A-V-E-E.
I found it.
It's the blood of heroes.
Is the description cancer from the north?
Because that's what it says.
Cancer from the north?
Yeah, it says the about me, I guess, is cancer from the north.
Is that right?
Yes, yes, that is it.
Yeah, yeah.
OK, that's it.
I am about to post it into the live chat.
So if you guys wish to find this, all you need to do is click the link, post it into the live chat, which is connected.
Or follow what Rags' instructions were, which were very clearly defined because I found the channel through them.
Yes, there you go.
Yes, Spider-Man is back so that real fans can tell us how bad he is.
We'll see.
If in Spider-Man 3 or far from, I don't know what they would call it, Home Far From, whatever, it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
The point is that if it's one that matches what they want, it might be one that they like.
Who knows?
Um, OK.
Does Batman like origins?
Find out at google.com.
Sorry, not origins.
Oranges.
Or- Oranges.
Batman like oranges?
Or- Or- Oranges.
Answer the question, Jay.
You're skirting, right?
You're deflecting.
I saw that.
He likes Shrek.
Does that answer my question?
I don't think so.
I'm getting the sleepy.
Also, hi Rags.
Hello, hi.
Mauler, thanks for the shoutout.
New subs and writing advice.
I made a video on objectivity and art, and I'm working on my first praise video on Breaking Bad's finale.
Please tell everyone to subscribe.
If you find anything interesting from what I just said, you can find it at Evan Monroe, the YouTube channel.
That is- It has the face of- What's his name?
The guy from so many things.
Ryan Gosling from Blade Runner, the new one.
Ryan Gosling, Blade Runner, the new one.
He's gonna review objectivity and art and Breaking Bad's finale.
Check it out.
Ryan?
Baby Goose?
I think I've seen the new Blade Runner.
Yes.
Your thoughts.
I like it.
I like it.
Ooh.
Conflict.
What do you mean?
Ephap's a cult.
We all agree with the exact take.
No, there's never disagreement.
Well, I liked it, but I haven't finished it yet.
In fairness, I might have liked it.
You haven't even finished?
What the fuck, Jay?
Jesus Christ.
I was supposed to get on a plane, and then my plane landed.
Oh, okay.
It caused a disturbance on the plane, so it can't land.
Caused disturbance?
I must finish Blade Runner.
In fairness, I might have liked it if not for the fact that I was informed by a friend
about how bad it is.
Oh, shit.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
I haven't had any friends inform me about how bad it is.
It might be.
I'm down for it.
I don't have any real- I really, really like Blade Runner, the first one.
I love the first one.
I like the second one, but I haven't really-
I don't like the first one.
Jay, stop it.
Okay.
Jesus fucking Christ.
Every goddamn day.
It's too slow.
Every goddamn day.
Is it always going to- is it going to be like this forever?
Too slow.
Okay, Jay.
It is too slow.
No, no, no, no, no.
It's too slow.
That's you, Jay.
Go leave.
Oh, I can't- I've- Oh, why- Chat wants to know, why do you not like it, Jay?
Sorry.
I'm just looking at the fucking algorithm.
I just said it's too slowly paced for me.
I didn't have the patience for it.
Don't you think that's racist, Jay?
Oh, my God.
What do I think that's racist?
I don't know.
Goodness.
Whatever.
Fine, fine, fine.
Will we read the Star Wars leaks?
If read-
I kind of want to be shocked.
Well, so I've read some, and I've heard some people cover it.
I've not read them all myself.
I've got a link to reading them, and I've been waiting for the right eFap to sort of
read them out.
They're fun to discuss, to say the least.
Oh, yeah.
Let's do it then.
If it's going to be fun for eFap, let's do it.
And we don't know which of them are true or not.
We never know.
So I was going to wait until we have-
You can vote.
What you could call the right guest to really dig into it.
So there's a good chance, and it ends with high rugs.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, hello.
Can we just read one leak now?
No.
No, no.
It has to be the whole thing.
How dare you.
Great Steven Universe video rags.
I'm glad that you really liked it.
I put a lot of effort into watching that show, which was an amazing show.
That's great in every way.
Kickmawler, I'm offended.
Also, hi, Jay.
Hello.
Hi.
At work, we'll have to ex-post facto fap with y'all later.
Yeah, keep out.
He's all good.
Nice to see you here, Aiden.
Kraut continues to be a massive.
Call into TDS again, Aiden.
You should call in too, mawler.
You need to get him on an efap.
What's TDS?
The Donkey Show.
Oh man, I love the Donkey Show.
Dude, the Donkey Show was so good back in the day.
Is this still going?
I didn't know the Donkey Show was still going.
I will definitely have the Donkey Show guest.
I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
The next person said, hi, just got here.
What did I miss?
13 hours of nonsense?
I don't know.
It's kind of hard to work.
Efap plot hole.
Rags is always the woman.
Why is that a plot hole?
That's consistent.
Yeah, that's consistency right there.
First off, you thinking that my gender has to be consistent is very offensive.
That's a plot hole.
No, that's a reality contrivance.
That's a fucked up ism-tism.
Ism-trivance.
I don't understand for those.
Jay is the little brother of Efap.
Change my mind.
Why would I want to change your mind about that?
I think it's okay with it.
Are you okay with it?
I'm alright with it.
I can still hear her breathing.
That's a good thing though.
That's generally a good sign I find.
Have you guys heard about George Lucas feeling betrayed by how Disney have been treating Star Wars in Bob Iger's book?
Yes.
We did mention it a couple of times throughout the streams.
We've been doing it.
We mentioned it briefly.
Alright.
Jay, would you please call and whistle for rags to come?
First of all, I can't whistle.
You can't even- you can't even-
You don't have to whistle?
I can't whistle.
You can. You just don't know how. You can.
Okay, okay, let me freeze that.
I don't know how to whistle.
Ow.
I currently do not have the skills required to whistle.
You've never been like curious and-
I've been curious about many things.
Jay, I'm disappointed that you were never taught how to whistle.
I was- I tried.
Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.
You've disappointed Efap as a whole.
Again, like twice in two minutes.
In Jay's guest info on Efap.me, it needs to say does not know how to whistle.
That's an important detail.
See, this super chat assumed you could because it said like he's one of those silly regular dogs, not the incredibly intelligent, articulate, and handsome doggo that he actually is.
Well, Jay can't even whistle. Sorry, super chat. Jay is disappointed.
Well, he's gonna have to come up with an alternative.
Like fucking just clicking his fingers before he doesn't even know how to do that.
Come!
What?
Come.
That doesn't work, Jay. Come. That's just racist.
Oh, I'm waiting for- oh, is that it?
I mean, that's what I was told to do.
Wow.
I think you-
Aiden is snoring as your-
I don't feel compelled to change my location to one that's closer to you.
I just don't- I don't feel that desire to obey, you know?
There's nothing in my little doggy heart that feels like I should go out of my way to travel over in your direction.
Belch.
It says Aiden is lawful good, is a long woman.
I mean, she may be a long woman in comparison to, like, short woman, but I mean-
That's one long woman.
Efap long requires you stay awake for at least 15 hours per day.
Now, boy, just make sure that when you grow up you find yourself a nice long woman who won't fall asleep during your podcast.
Luke having an Efok- Efok- Ewok booze dream would be a good end. Agreed.
That tells you how far back we are.
Yeah, man.
The Rise of Skywalker when Rey travels-
I almost- I- I stopped for a second to wonder to myself if that was last stream or like a stream we had weeks ago.
What is that?
The Rise of Skywalker when Rey travels back to return to the Jedi and kills via auto-Iwokia asphyxiation.
Um.
Auto-Iwokia.
Um.
Oh, apparently Efap 54 has been hit with copyright by the way.
What? For what?
It says- it's been- information about your video- it's been hit with tune call publishing. It's probably the horror music we played.
Oh, good damn it.
What was it? Is it-
It says-
Playable or blocked?
Um.
Oh, so this is one of those ones where it says it's making money for itself but you can make money too?
It's one of those weird ones.
Oh, wow. I've literally never encountered one of those.
Yeah, it's like the- the- the lowest form of copyright claim where they're like, let's make money together. And you're like, wow.
Like, okay.
Like, that's- that's- that's in- oh, I didn't even know that was- I'm kinda dumbstruck.
Um, alright.
Mauler, what is the best objective episode of The Simpsons and your personal favorite?
I'd have to rewatch them all to be able to give you an answer to the former question, but the latter-
Um, the episode where Bart is learning to become good at ice hockey and Leia- Leia- Lisa becomes really good at it.
Why can't I remember the name? It's the ice hockey episode. There's a shit ton of good- good fucking jokes in it.
And the reason- the reason why I remember this is because we were told for show and tell to bring in our favorite episodes of television in school.
Um.
I know, right? And- and, uh, it was- it was across the week. And when it came to my turn, I brought in the ice hockey episode of Simpsons.
And literally the turn before me was a guy who brought the same thing in and was like, wow.
That just makes me pointless, doesn't it? I used to know the name of it. Oh, is it called Bart versus Lisa?
Someone in chat said that. That could be it.
Is that the one where, uh, Lisa has a hockey stick that is, like, on a bar- someone has a hockey stick that's full of termites and then the house gets eaten?
No. That's not what happens. But, one of the jokes I remember is right at the beginning, uh, Lisa tells Bart that it's snowing and she throws ice from the freezer into him.
Oh, that one.
And he runs outside in his pajamas. He's like, oh my god, it's snowing, it's great. And he's just- he's sitting in a wheel that's sunny. And he's like, oh.
And then Jimbo, the bully, says, ha ha, Simpson, look at your pajamas. Did your mommy buy them for you? And it just cuts the body. He goes, of course she did. Who else would have?
And he's like, all right, Simpson, you win this route.
So good.
Yeah, I'm just- yeah, I'm seven or whatever.
Oh shit, Lisa on Ice. That sounds like it's the actual name of the episode, Lisa on Ice. I'm pretty sure that's actually Mr. Gently Benevolent. Nice, nice job. I'm pretty sure that's the name of it.
Okay, moving on. Uh, that would be my pick for probably favorite, but there's a bunch of favorites.
Recently broke up with my partner of nine years, and going through all your guys' backlog has been beyond helpful, particularly Mola's Outlast series. Love you all so much, including you, Jay.
Thanks.
Yeah, I'm sorry that that happened, but I'm glad that you're feeling better, I assume, and that you love Jay. That must mean something.
I mean, must be desperate.
Uh, episode nine theory. Ray will pull a Home Alone 2 and unleash a flock of porgs onto Kylo and Emperor Palpatine, ravaging their bodies to bones. The end.
I'd watch it.
I'm not saying it would be bad.
Uh, all. Who is your Soulsborne waifu, and why is it Rosabeth from the stone? Hashtag DS2 Best Souls. First of all, let me correct you there.
What you meant to say was DS2 is the worst, but I can see how you may have made that mistake. That's okay.
Was that from Harris?
That was from Dragon's Advocate, so it may as well be called Harris's Advocate.
Uh, the best, the best one is obviously the Fire Keeper from DS3, but that's kind of subjective. I'm not going to take that away.
Um, yeah, you know, I wonder what you guys would choose, but then again, I wonder if you guys have played all the Dark Souls games. I don't actually know.
Um, I will say I've have played all of them there, right? If you can promise there will be no.
What you said, but I agree with that.
The smooth sounds of Aiden sleeping in the background for everything we cover.
Um, we will carry on.
So, uh, John Wick has Rambo Syndrome first movie. It's basically on its own.
Two and three were fun, where one was just good on its own, but it's basically a different movie.
I don't necessarily disagree with that. One was a different movie to two and three. Two and three seemed to do other things.
As I said, wait for Metal Commander's video. That'll clear up how I feel about three, and then eventually two.
From Nude Rotic, Buffy Bros. Agreed. Aiden knows her comics and has all my respect.
I feel like that's probably fair. You should have her on to, um, Friday Night Tights or something like that.
Comic Bros forever, because I'm very bad when it comes to comics, but I could totally, uh, understand. Comic people uniting.
Jay, I was watching your Another Life video, and my computer crashed. Why did you break my computer, Jay? Why?
That's just how bad the fucking show is. It's unironically, I think, genuinely the worst thing I've seen.
It's pretty bad. When I was watching your video, it's the kind of thing where you're like, why does this exist?
Because at least with Game of Thrones, it's got seven seasons behind it, but this one is just like, wow, so what made this?
There are unironic theories that it's an experiment from Netflix where they're data mining to see how bad of a show people will put up with.
That's how bad it is that people have to theorize that it's bad on purpose as an experiment.
What are the limits?
Okay. Hey, Mauler.
Sorry, what was that?
I was just thinking I'm finding an article about that.
Who'd or played Metroid Prime Trilogy with mouse and keyboard support? Also, favorite Nintendo franchises for you guys?
So I've not played... I was just going to say quickly that I've played Metroid Prime and Prime Echoes on controller when it's mapped to GameCube controls, but I've played them on GameCube as well.
I've still not played the third one. I've never played them in mouse and keyboard.
I played the third on the Wii, and it was okay. Like, I got bored of it, honestly. I just was... I became rather disinterested in it. It just didn't grab me, but it was so long ago, I probably couldn't say any more than that, actually.
I just remember quickly becoming bored of it.
Jay has linked us a Reddit thread that's titled, Was Another Life Made Bad On Purpose?
Do you understand the person who wrote that would be so fucking offended by that thread? Like, excuse me.
This is unironic as well. That's how fucking bad the show is. It's insanely bad.
Another Life? That movie?
I want to... yeah, it's the video Jay-Babe.
I mean, the video wasn't awful, but the...
Oof. Anyway, it says that, what's your favorite Nintendo franchise? Mine probably would be Metroid, but it's not exactly easy because there's a lot of good Nintendo franchises.
Like Mario Kart or Mario Party.
Super Smash Brothers is up there.
I'm thinking back to my GameCube days. Resident Evil's so hit and miss.
Well, one of my favorite games of all time, like, well, yeah, up there and maybe my top five or ten or whatever, there is...
I'm not sure if this is a Nintendo one, but it was on the GameCube. It's called Bait and Catos, Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean.
And that took me a good 60 or so hours to beat, and I really loved that game. I adored Bait and Catos.
For a second, they were going to say 60 years.
No, no, no, no, no, only 60 hours, but I really, really love that game.
I think that they made another one that I didn't play, but just from the first, I would say it's among the best games ever.
Wii Sports.
There you go. Wii Sports is Jay's favorite Nintendo fan.
I've not played any Nintendo games.
It's because you're a bad person, Jay. Do you understand this?
I had a Wii. I had a Wii, and I think that's my only Nintendo console ever.
It's because you're a bad person.
On that, I played Zelda Twilight Forest.
No.
Lego Batman.
No.
Need for speed.
Wii Sports, of course, and Wii Fit.
Oh, shit. I can't think of anything else.
No.
I don't know if I guess I because I've actually forgot and I don't know why I did, but Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS games.
And if that's the case, I don't know if we're allowed to do.
Square Enix developed it with OneUp Studio.
I don't know how Nintendo's involvement in it was, but Sword of Mana on the GameCube.
Sorry, the Game Boy I mentally like.
I love Sword of Mana.
I haven't played any other ones, but I really love Sword of Mana.
What are some of the old and, of course, like this, just the basic Super Mario's are really, really good.
I've spent untold hours in Super Mario World.
You just pick Mario.
It's a good franchise.
Yeah.
Mario Mario's great, man.
Yeah.
Super Mario World 2, I believe.
Because when you're not Jay, you pick correct things.
That's just a cool benefit of not being.
Super Mario Bros.
God, because they all have like the same fucking name.
Yep.
Super Mario Bros.
It couldn't have just been Mario.
It had to be Super.
It just, you know, you confused everything.
No, it's not Super Mario Bros 2.
It's Super.
Jeez, I can't remember the fuck.
Super Mario Bros 2 on the Game Boy.
Was that the one where you had to collect the six coins?
It's the one with like the Star World.
You got the Star World and you go in and you go to the Star World and go
around and you got the multicolored Yoshi's.
There's like the blue one and the red one.
I was going to say, do you know what I'm talking about with the Game Boy game?
Whether you have to collect the six points to defeat Wario.
I was obsessed with that one.
And for some reason, I remember the pig boss more than anything.
The pig that splits into three pigs and you have to.
One of them rolls really fast, but then one of them bounces in weird ways.
Oh, Animal Crossing.
I really like Animal Crossing.
Was there like a Rayman rabbits game or something?
Yes, there was.
But that's modern because you're young.
You don't know about old stuff, Jay.
Be old.
I played the old Raymans.
Did you play the Rayman?
Oh, does Nintendo do Fire Emblem?
I couldn't have answered this question.
There's so many things to talk about.
The Mario karts are good.
Double Dash was OK.
It was my least favorite.
I loved Double Dash, but that's probably because I was I was a GameCube child.
Like I loved everything on GameCube pretty much.
Yeah, I just think it was.
It's my least favorite.
I think the DS one was.
I love the DS one.
I'll tell you something.
If I can share with you, if you call it that on DS, where you could basically have one guy with the game
and you could share it to seven people and have you all play.
Thank you.
Mario Kart.
That was a genius decision because back in my day, people would be like, oh, look at them.
Nintendo people playing Nintendo games.
You have no idea what you're missing.
No idea.
I could play Nintendo DS.
Mario Kart shit was intense.
So much so much shit to do.
It's insane.
Well, it's like in Super Mario World, there was a level that was.
And you could there was always a star.
You could always get the star powered up the star power when you were in one of the levels.
And you could run through the enemies and get like fifteen plus lives in one run easy.
And you could do it over and over and over so you could max out at nine hundred ninety nine lives.
I think you're talking about Maryland to know Super Mario World.
Maryland to you could do that.
Yeah. Don't he just said Super Maryland to Legend of the six coins.
That's the one I was asking.
Which you could do what Rags just described in that as well.
Once you hit like if you took the star and you have to kill like ten enemies.
And as soon as you've killed that many, you start getting one plus life for every kill.
Oh, Elite Beat agents.
I don't know if anyone played Elite Beat agents.
I love that on the DS.
There is some good stuff in that.
I love me some Elite Beat agents.
I'm going to kick on because I feel like a bad super chat.
You you you asked us a question.
It was really good.
So you're a bad person now.
This one says it's great to see Aiden on finally.
Hi Rags.
Hello.
Just got here.
Who's the chick.
Hi Rags.
Hey.
The chick is Aiden.
She's currently sleeping.
We're not going to bother until her mother comes in to wake her up again.
Wake me up.
Wake me up.
It's time to cover Houston production's TLJ video.
It's all it's all on the to-do list.
This one was on the to-do list and we finally did it in the course of 12 hours.
You know, it's tough.
Burn table has a TLJ video.
See, we got him too.
And we're close to episode.
It's been nearly two years and we haven't covered them all yet Rags.
Have we failed as a podcast?
Is that fail?
We haven't failed as a podcast because.
I think we would be a failure if we didn't.
Even there's only so much that one podcast can do.
That's true.
And I think that we've made such an incredible effort that few would say that we failed in our refutation.
You have to be nuts to think that we failed in refuting all of these terrible videos.
It takes time, guys.
You got to explore all of it.
Break it down.
Got to define shit.
And then you got to figure out the logic.
It's tough.
It's tough.
You know what?
It's we're getting there.
And it doesn't.
You know, we may cover the Sean TLJ video in 10 years from now, but it will be covered.
It'll still be shit.
It'll still be covered and it'll still be shit.
You've got 500 special.
Yes.
Here's my odd question for the stream.
Quentin is a 40K style inquisitor.
Do you join chaos or fight to make the Imperium great again?
You fight to make the Imperium great again, of course.
Submit my answer to Rags because of the context or whatever he said.
Even consider chaos.
Oh, can't imagine.
He sounds pretty cool to me.
What?
But if but but I would be Slenesh if I.
Oh, my.
It also ends in yo, Aiden, and she would say hi.
I'm going to say it to you in sleep talk.
Very good.
Yeah, I love it.
Say.
Shin.
Jitsu.
Nitora.
Sorokoto.
Waka.
Shani.
There you go.
I said it.
I don't know what that means.
Trust that it was a friendly.
Nice to see you on Aiden.
That's the toxic brood.
She's going to answer that with sleep talk.
Oh, Aiden, you're so funny.
You go too far sometimes, but I like it.
Wow.
First super chat.
Quinton video.
Finally.
Also, Hi, Rags.
Hello.
Press kick for Jay.
Nice.
Wine more rags.
I think this is in reference to the wall.
All right.
All right.
Well, you got your wish.
How do you guys feel about Joker?
Also, Hi, Rags.
Hello.
I haven't seen it yet.
Yeah, I plan to see it though.
I do want to see when it comes out.
I don't understand how it came out so early.
Like other people, but it's not yet for like everyone else.
So yeah, I'll see it when it comes out for sure.
Looks like it's going to be good.
That's your opinion.
Is that what it looks like?
Yeah, Jay.
Is that what it looks like?
Yes.
Can you confirm that with facts and logic?
Can you confirm that it won't turn you into a racist sexist?
I think the incel is the group they're worried about.
Okay, fine.
A racist, sexist incel.
I can confirm it won't turn me into an incel.
What a racist sexist?
Aren't you already an incel?
Yeah.
No.
All right.
Fine twist, Rags.
Don't trust his lies.
You're a, you're a vole cell.
They don't trust his lies.
I believe that would just be a celibate.
An incel a bit?
It's just being, it's just being, uh, specific.
Yeah.
How do you respond to that, Jason?
Why do you hate specificity?
Why do you hate everything, Jay?
You racist to everything.
I don't know.
I just don't like stuff.
Roof right there.
We don't need anything more.
Um, how do you go?
Oh, yeah.
I read a slow songs.
They for skinny hoes.
I can't move all of this here to one of those.
I'm a thick bitch.
I need tempo.
All right.
I feel like Rags is just venting about an imaginary straw man.
This is definitely about the wall.
I have no comment anybody.
Uh, for Fenner, unfortunately, I found your channel via this controversy,
but I'm glad I did.
You're really good.
Keep up the good work.
I think Fenner would appreciate that.
I will save it for when Fenner becomes a guest onto eFap.
I'll read it out.
Rags literally calls things bad without explanation on a regular basis.
Yes.
One yet wants to call others out for doing the same thing.
When?
When?
I don't know.
Well, this is actually, I think I probably have at some point,
but I,
it'll usually be in context of something that I consider to be obviously bad.
And so at this point with TLJ with us,
I've been over it so much and I was going to say,
will we still qualify the argument?
But if I was to go as far as making a video and all I said during the video
was that this thing is bad, that would be bad.
I wouldn't have a problem with anyone saying my video was bad because I don't
typically do that.
You can find portions of a video in which I may do that,
but never a full video.
And that's kind of what we were going for with Ralph.
Especially if the context is something like, oh,
and just some passing comment.
What did you think of such and such?
You know, not like a proper video that I'm making uploading to the channel.
Average person.
Nostalgia Critic's review of the wall is the worst analytical video on YouTube.
Me, an intellectual, remarkable Republican.
Enough said.
I mean, yeah, that's definitely our class as Nostalgia Critic.
No, a remarkable Republican makes the best videos on YouTube.
I don't understand.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fener, I just watched Winifred control video and others looked fine to me.
What the heck are people comparing that to that?
They get critical.
I'm going to go ahead and say that because I'm not sure what that's referencing
exactly.
I don't want to be out of gun's age.
Like I said, Fener, we'll, we'll visit Efap one day.
Hi, Aidan.
Aidan, what do you have to say to Dr. Martin Luther Pepe saying hi to you?
Jay?
Hello.
I was waiting for like a snore noise, but I didn't get one.
It was not Jay, it was Aidan.
Oh.
For a postmodern perspective, nothing can be good.
Yes, but also nothing can be bad.
It's an interesting world.
It is.
Is it sad that I'm at Disney World and extremely disappointed because I'm
missing Efap?
Well, that's the beauty of Moolah.
You can catch up if you wish to.
If you're busy at the time, it's not a problem.
You're going to be at Disney World to burn it down.
Based degenerate fury animator, your segment was legitimately the most
interesting part.
I should say that.
Yeah, it was.
I think so.
I found it to be the best part of the video.
And I was very interested in hearing the lyrics.
At the end of the day, Pink Floyd is great.
And you should listen to them.
Dark Side is greater than the wall.
Just saying also.
Hello, rags.
Hello.
Recently subbed to you.
And I really like your stuff so far.
Keep of the awesome.
Thanks.
And you're okay too, Moolah.
Why thank you.
Glad you like it.
I think my favorite Pink Floyd song is.
Probably.
Time.
Jabba in chat said, Aiden, let other people speak for fuck's sake.
Calm the fuck down, Aiden.
At J, Steven Universe at best is disappointing.
That's subjective.
Season five is like an amateur scat porn in comparison.
Well, if I'm going to watch a scat porn, well, I would probably want to watch a
professional one instead of an amateur one.
I find with like most porn homegrown is better.
Well, okay.
I will say this.
I prefer amateur porn to like professional production porn.
But with scat porn, I think I would I wouldn't want to leave that to the
amateurs.
Yeah.
Someone's like, oh, it's really good scat porn.
I'd be like, that's okay.
Yeah, that's some price and some sensitive shit.
I don't understand what people look for in that.
So I wouldn't pay if I found.
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
Right.
Consistency.
And yeah, they need that.
We're going to get into the poop talk again.
The themes really need to be consistent in that.
Well, if we had your poo teacher here, Jay, he could tell us about makes good
scat porn.
I'll ask him on.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Film is the baseline they should have had since three.
It's still naff.
I like this.
This this text is supposed to chat.
Aidan contributes more asleep than Jay does awake.
Jay, Jay, fuck him up.
I like how Jay is our V.
I don't want to.
Ironically, though, the meme about how it will make a 24 hour one by accident.
We're at 11 plus two hours, 13 hours.
And we're not even close to finishing Super chess.
He started streaming yesterday.
This is actually insane.
Okay.
Next one.
Not even a single video about cows has been uploaded to the moolah channel.
I want my money back.
I'm sorry.
We will have a cow video eventually and it will satisfy your feeling slash once.
Feel once.
That's what I call it.
All right.
Hey, guys.
Not sure if you remember, but I chatted in 49 about joining the Air Force.
The support was amazing and I wanted to update.
I just passed my physical and I'm on my way out soon.
Keep up doing.
Keep up the good work.
Well, yeah, I mean, hey, that's really that's really, really nifty.
Congratulations on that.
I imagine that the Air Force requirements can be restrictive.
So it's good that you passed it.
It's good stuff, man.
I hope that it works out.
Have fun flying your airplanes and jumping out of airplanes and fixing airplanes
and just doing airplane stuff.
All of the airplane.
At Fenner real talk, your animations gyrate too much.
Yeah, I think Rags actually addressed that.
Yeah.
And I think Fenner.
Yeah.
Well, took good constructive criticism.
It's the idea that like you've got this full body and you're like, should all of it be moving at all times?
And it's like, maybe not.
Some things do say so.
The squirrel on the squirrel on the table was what kind of threw me off because it was just standing there.
But it was moving like it was basically like like underwater during a tide.
It was swaying back and forth in this weird way.
And it looks strange.
It looks kind of like what I might call a dream.
Like a lot of it is very abstract.
It's almost like if a fighter in a video game, you're like a street fighter game.
Oh, yeah.
It's a perfect comparison.
They never stop moving at fist bump, you know, moving up a little bit.
And they're pacing back and forth, you know, on the spot a little bit, kind of bouncing a little.
That was a bit.
Anyway, I just grew up.
Finally caught you guys live again.
Missed the past two weeks due to my own idiocy.
Jay is the best manager one could ask for.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm going to say, what is your experience with managers?
I mean, I don't have a good experience with managers, but still.
Hey, really? All right.
Okay.
Disney, I'll take 25 percent.
Sony. Good, Disney.
Just give back Spooderman.
I can't live without him.
I don't know what the deal was.
There's probably information on that.
But, yeah, I just in terms of Sony, I'd be like, nice.
You're going to make a lot of money with him being a part of the MCU.
You may as well.
Like, I seriously doubt that motivation is a part of creative freedom.
It's got to be to do with money.
Yeah.
Just go ahead.
It's Sony.
X-Men D.O.F.P. is basically endgame without seeing Infinity War.
X-Men Days of Future Past.
Um, yeah.
No, it's not.
I mean, they're arguing that they all die at the end, right?
They don't all die at the end of the endgame.
Nobody dies in the game at all.
No, they do.
You keep saying that.
Stop it.
I'm going to drop out now because I'm falling asleep.
So hopefully when I wake up, you guys will still be going and I can come back.
Well, maybe.
Good night, Jay.
Thank you for hanging out for the 13 hours or whatever.
Good night, guys.
Good.
You know, you could have watched the Lord of the Rings instead of...
Shut up.
Goodbye, Jay.
Never mind.
I heard Jay's pronunciation of Aluminium.
He's no longer the best manager.
It's Aluminium though.
It's not Alam-
It's Al-
Al-
I'm all-
In my business writing class, we learned that opinions are based purely on emotion.
Whereas arguments are based on evidence, logic, and fact.
Do you agree with this?
No.
So I think I can speak for both me and Rags here.
We see opinion as almost synonymous with the term judgment.
And you can make many judgments in many different ways.
judge that you need to eat based on the pure fact that you feel a form of hunger.
You could also judge that Poe was not given the information he required in
order to make decisions that would have been more beneficial to the Rebel, or
specifically because Holdo did not provide them to him irrationally.
There's lots of judgments that can be made in lots of different ways and the
typical way to discover whether or not a judgment was objective or subjective is
based on the criteria slash evidence. That's where we're at. Rags, what would
you add to that? I would say that an opinion is not necessarily based on
facts or knowledge. It can be, but it isn't necessary that it is. So you can
have an opinion that is purely subjective, one that is purely based on
your emotion or any internal biases you might have, or it could be completely
based on nothing except information that you've gathered and experiences
that you are putting together to make your essentially your judgment. And
something I'd like to try in future with people we may debate with or may not is
when we reach the term opinion I'd be like all right let's continue this
conversation but you're not allowed to use the word opinion. Let's see what they
do instead because it would be interesting to see how they try and what
word they would substitute opinion for just see how it works out. So Chad is
saying that Aidan outlived Jay? Outslept? At first I didn't like and seize the
wall but then I read some Heigl and applied some reader response theory now
I fully understand the deeper memes sorry themes I get it I do it's just
that the thing with Nostalgia Critic's The Wall is when I finished it I was
like bewildered but then I just looked into it yeah I was like yeah we just
like looked at the script and what was being said and we're like oh some of this
is I empathize with the feeling of what I get it what like what the fuck was
that but I was curious I was like what are the lyrics I was like oh these
lyrics are interesting that's all if you if people look into the lyrics and
still find it nonsense fair enough I would just recommend check out the
lyrics they're all listed on like the kind of awesome website I think don't
have a look if you'd like right the the wall has always been a favorite of mine
it's great to see you talk you all talk about music some more especially with
concept albums slice and dice everybody I mean we didn't really talk about the
music as much as you may have wanted us to but we you know we basically didn't
talk about the music pretty much at all because we just don't I don't know about
reviewing music I'm not a music guy I'm not a musician I don't really know
enough about instruments and putting them together and stuff like that so
pretty much reserved my judgment on that one yeah I'm not someone who typically
judges music because I don't know enough about it to be able to make certain
claims but I can say I enjoy the music of the wall and in terms of nostalgia
critics the wall I guess I'd have to listen to it some more to define which
ones I like and don't like and maybe what reasons I have for each of those
because the wall itself from
the Pink Floyd has been around for a very long time so I can further
articulate it you know it's this whole thing and I think all I wanted from this
stream was that we address it because I know a lot of people wanted us to and
I'm like we did it there we go we've addressed it hopefully to the degree
people wanted us to we don't have the perspective I think most of us most
people expected us to but that's okay Jay are you going to upload soon okay
Jay say something yeah what the fuck yeah Jay hey Jay what wait Jay Jay's not
here Jay's got Aidan's still here with us Aidan's blasted on she's funny though
this is the second super chat that said so the first one says Jay gonna upload
soon and the second one says because you shouldn't it's okay Jay you don't need
to answer the question I think the super chatter is okay the way that it's
started and just its own conversation mules Lee not related to this stream
tonald uses a lot of accounting language in his videos a few effaps ago
rags remarks a few effaps ago rags remarks at tonalds odd use of the word
materially which in accounting to lingo means financially significant okay so I
was right yeah that's odd but I didn't know that but he didn't he did have like
an economics degree didn't he or something like that I'm pretty sure he
does and he said that that's what he was doing before he became YouTube and then
he's he's going back to it as a result of YouTube not being profitable enough
which tonald please we need more of your juice we need more of your your your
sustenance I need it I feel like you got that from the t-shirt stream is that
what you're referencing with that dead to fluid no I got it from I got it from
a bro team stream a long time really because you the character there was a
character and then the guy was like oh look she fell in a looks like she's been
dipped in gender fluid really because I don't know that reference but if you
remember I don't know if you remember this is very this is this is distant for
you and it's super distant for a fat memes but before we did the stream with
metal or during I was linked did you remember the linked picture of somebody
pulling out the ethernet cable and there was water coming out of it yeah and so
that so we have that and then during the the stream people someone mentions that
that someone was like doing like a sexy dance let's go that way and I think
Fortia said that's money and then you said no that's gender fluid and then I
say is that what was coming out of the ethernet cable gender fluids somehow you
could reach with completely altered the directions of parts it's wonderful the
world related but also well it does have the word fluid in it I'm sure there's a
lot of people out room been like a rags doesn't like lady in the lamp because it
doesn't represent shibes is it shibes or sheebs shibes shibes superior dog race
yeah that's true they're not in the not in the trailer they're probably not on
the film that is offensive discuss to say that is offensive personally I'm Jack
I'm offended have Aiden and Jay tell us how to support them if they're still on
when they read this so Jay's channel a j-axi can be found by typing in J a y
e x c I will find him he's linked in the description of this video if he's not I
will sort that out on the moolah channel and Aiden is definitely links and find
her on on Aiden paladin a y d i n e a l a d i n that is find them through there
and then they will have different links on how to support them patreon and
possibly other things also hello moolah and rags hello hey hope you all have a
nice have a great week Wow a great week that's better than a nice week thank you
very much moolah I love you here's $25 for you to buy avatar the last airbender
oh the complete series sorry that's not not the not Shamala mala mala on the
one yes I'm gonna I'm going to watch it too many people keep telling me to and
wolf wants me to watch it I'm gonna get to it Jay watch Lord of the Rings he's
not gonna do that I don't know what what do you think the motivation behind Jay
not watching it is rags what's going on there life life itself is preventing him
because maybe I mean like all we have to do is threaten his life and maybe he'll
do it do you think there'll be enough I think that if he watches it it will
stop the memes of him not having watched it and it'll make him upset it's
possible I don't know who knows what would who knows what would convince Jay
it's pretty hard to know you'll get there one day Aiden you're amazing also
high rags hey hashtag the dawn stands with Mick Vic Mignona that I'm sure you
may very well do I don't you know I believe it gush of celestial apex apex
all this all this super chat says is get sargot on gonna happen I'm thinking
the idea of sargon and and arch wall hammer in the same episode those two
double-guessed over that huh they'd probably go well together yeah I feel
like they go well together play a lot of killing floor with them I feel like I
know that they go well together now yeah I think so Quinton is a meme so the
order is irrelevant I'm not sure exactly what that's referencing but I
don't disagree with it Quinton is a meme you probably haven't seen it yet but I
made a doogle gawk do Google Doc cataloging Google Doc cataloging the
origins of efap memes WIP to share the glory I'm not risk reading that it says
glory now off to drink more rhino milk to kill my flu well thank you for
cataloging the efap memes I have to say in my experience has never been more
confusing efap law sorry the glory may the glory be with you may the glory be
with you all plump rumps in a row daddy's gonna have fun tonight and then
there's the uwu and the the pointing finger and the okay symbol in blind
intercourse my goodness pyrocynical just made a film review about the film cube
and it's crap sequel from how he described it I don't know how I'm just
now hearing about it I've seen the cube and the cube sequel I need you to go to the
guests of efap on the effect here I'll I'll show I'll send you a picture I'll
send you a picture right here this is amazing so it is so what am I looking at
cannot whistle I still it's weird I still remember the day I learned how to
whistle I was doing a long car drive and I heard my dad whistling I was like can
you tell me how to do that and he told me how to do it and I've known since do
you remember when you were taught how to whistle ranks or do you is it sort of a
thing I don't think I was taught I just sort of found out I think and I was
always a really when I was young like really good whistler this is the thing
I'm I can whistle but I can't whistle like bro whistlers like some people can
whistle like crazy you can't you're you're just like a gear casual one of
them normie whistlers but it's better to be that than to be a not whistler also
yeah I've seen cube on cube 2 I like cube cube 2 is weird as fuck it's like
super abstract and tism I give up on it I haven't seen cube I've heard of it it's
um do you know what it is yeah I know like kind of it's like well in case you
don't it's a bunch of people wake up inside a room and they're like what the
fuck and it's like a series of rooms inside a cube that all have a different
sort of requirement to move on to the next room and it's like I think it's
rated I want to say that for like people can yeah I've seen like one or
two little bits here and there and it's in it looks interesting are you guys
aware of the 80s slash 90s American hip-hop artist tone look I figured
tonal's name must be inspired by him total meme potential here I'm not
honestly I'm not I'm not aware of tonal the American hip-hop artist well let's
hope that he is able to make videos long into the future and that he doesn't
go tonal yeah I agree with that explain your superpower of stopping people liking
stuff this is from government's greeting my and made dark forces become confused
on the way to your house rags oh yeah we do have a superpower we say stuff and
then people's feelings are removed from them I can't believe it it's a thing we
have but it's totally a thing we have according to our critics you mentioned
justifying objective criteria using an argument crossing the fact-value
distinction but most philosophers outside of post-modernism tend to frown
on frown on this are there those who have written on it that you agree with
so I wouldn't reference a philosopher but when yeah cuz I we don't like read
and know ah this is a galleon ah yes is Descartes the ah this is you know
tata does like to tell us the concept those I brought up before the is versus
the ought a lot of people bring up but let's just say and I always use this as
a reference you can use a couple of different crafts to make this simpler
for people but the dovetail joint is a dovetail joint and there's many degrees
in which you cannot be what I mean by that is when you create something that's
fucked up on the angle that's integrity is failing there's lots of things and
you could you let's just say you have a pile of dust and what I mean by that is
like wooden dust or whatever you call it like chippings to the point with it
atoms it's just just dust and someone's like wow that's literally the complete
opposite of what I was asking for like the degree to which your item or object
or entity here is a dovetail joint is literally as far away from it as
possible okay so that's you could you could call that a zero on the scale and
then the degree to which one is perfect in terms of angle and structure and
integrity is 100 on the scale and so everything in between as much as
anything below 100 is technically what you could call not a dovetail joint
it would still be important to distinguish the difference and so
when you transpose that to storytelling when you have a film
that has one plot hole just one that gets in the way of some stuff
and I think we went over this in the Lord of the Rings stuff there's a couple
of small issues not what I would call plot holes just a couple small issues
like wolf was bringing them up more than mean rags with
of like issues that totally exist is very small stuff that could only at most
provide bumps in what you may call the plot line
and then you compare to TLJ which has a billion plot holes
it's just everywhere so many problems that completely disrupt
the line itself and so do we say that a story is either complete or incomplete
and if it's incomplete then the Lord of the Rings and
the Last Jedi fall on the same category that doesn't seem right does it
because one of them is a disaster and one of them has tried very hard to nail
almost everything and nearly got there so the scale is created naturally
by the degree to which it achieves being the thing that it is
and so you have the question of is an oort ignore the oort
and the degree to which it is creates the scale
and thus the oort as crazy as that sounds and no I don't have a philosopher
to reference for that it's just how I believe we typically
talk about these things because if it's not binary for me rags and
wolf if a film has a plot hole it doesn't thus
enter into a group of as plot holes versus has no plot holes
there's got to be more more groups than two hopefully that explains that
so saw mauler's joke battle profile in efap 22 and wanted to check it out in
depth it's been updated now the long man has about eight lines of
powers and can destroy universes all right
that's how that works also high rags hey uh this one just says me high cheek
sent me high high rags hey ij kick rags
oh no got that backwards we gotta change that
uh my first time getting to efap along with y'all live have any of y'all played
or intend to play code vain so all i know is that i heard it made the
game journals upset so i kind of want to play it
apparently it's a souls like game as in it's kind of like dark souls
or inspired by and that makes me want to check it out i will maybe get there
one day but i haven't yet
uh the reason there's no beautiful rags art is because your beauty cannot be
replicated oh that is a nice thing to say and it

doug walker's eighth circle of hell level of cringe review of pink fly to
the wall feel like this person came in after the
wall conversation had ended uh sweet hopped in before the video
yeah the i think this is the longest intro we ever had wasn't it like nearly
two hours before we actually talked about the video
yeah we had a we had a very long beginning
mola what are your current projects so uh lots of efap stuff which you'll see
over the weeks being put out and then um lots of well a main project that i'll be
working on soon but we've got uh dark fate is coming out in under a
month i'm almost certain i'll want to make a video on that when i go watch it
because it's going to annoy me the to the depths of hell depths of heaven
because heaven has depths as well
all right
mola oh sorry what do you think of man of madan it's from the creators of until
dawn but not exclusively this time it's much shorter and would make a good video
i've not played it and i plan to play it once
metal commander comes to visit my humble home
so it'll be streamed on halloween is the plan
probably have a happy ghost in the corner it won't be a
efap gaming i don't imagine but it'll be a it'll be a we're playing this for
the funsies the creator of aluminium foil is why
americans say it wrong he misspelled aluminium on the
packaging but spelled it correctly on the patent
i honestly i had no idea so he's the reason why we say it correctly all right
and he's why americans say it wrong i'm not that's what the that's what the
super chat said rags i'm not saying it myself i i would never go that far yeah
because because all i have to say to that is do you think we
fought a war in 777 listen to some bunch of english people when he have a
proper american inventor who came up with uh even better way to say it
that's what i thought um origins page up on website for all you
massifs origins page origins
origin i guess that's where like the origins of the memes
well there is a oh you got okay so it's alphabetical
so the origins of apex homosexual arguably artificial barrier blockage
bagidius bilbo baggins black skull on wheels
blessed pipeman cosmic chicken daddled it's it's all here
i imagine it's being expanded as time goes on
that's impressive it's undeniably that's wonderful thank you very much
uh hi mauler love your outlast review i find it to be your most underrated
review any chance you would do an outlast two review
i've been told by many people that i should do an outlast two review if ever
it happens it's going to be a long time from now
i made the outlast review because i was getting frustrated at all the people
telling me that if i liked soma i would like outlast i was like no
outlast isn't very good and i will talk about why and i did
and then people were like but outlast two is out you should do that too and i
was like oh well i mean i don't i mean if you liked if soma you like
outlast two mauler no uh but it's not impossible i could
totally see myself doing that one day but there's a lot of things i could see
myself doing one day so so maybe in the future i don't know for
sure um i don't know if you have enough to discuss
mechanically compared to outlast one maybe a comparison oh yeah
what whatever outlast two offers i'm sure i could fit into a video i just um
i'm not sure if it'll happen in within the time frame well
realistically this way the closer it is to a movie the more familiar territory
it will be true true if you liked shoddy cast storyteller
series another youtuber got the rights to continue with it on his channel
tks mantis he has some previews am i shilling
yes only because i want to see the series continue
i have no idea what shoddy cast storyteller series is but um
yeah i don't know about that apparently it continued on tks mantis's
channel anybody who's curious that's where you can find it
the last part was meant as a joke the part where it says he's shilling
again i don't know what it is so all right
uh boo the super chat just says boo oh oh ah
trump's land kick ass to me there trump planned kikassia to happen so
kikassia i believe is the first animal awesome movie about
nostalgia critic purchasing a house that's on a piece of land
that technically isn't in america but it's you know what i mean like it's a
house in america but it's legally not american so you can pull it
whatever you want i think oh so that's the first attempt at a movie
so yeah good i'm sure it's available um hi
rasas last gaggles
hello i assume that's rasas last gaggles is rasas last gaggles that is me
it's my uh my friend jake's birthday was recently
please say happy birthday with my thigh meat on top
happy birthday with my thigh meat on top please try to find gaming cringe like
dark souls essays uh well you know we're doing our best we
come across it's mainly films but we do cover gaming sillies as well
it does happen as well uh and looks like this is when rah
joined the stream he said uh oh thank god efap is here i was about to make a
whole new e twitter account to rag on you to do a
stream because i was losing it thank god i'm glad
we provide you uh uh sustenance in in one form of the word
we live to please rah he is the sun god
um aden seems really cool you should do an efap with aden
yeah aden yeah aden is really cool yeah oh sorry it's one of our one of our
good guests it says you should do an efap with aden at star wars girl and jay
longbone we do yeah i think that could happen i
want to call it you get to look at women that's it i just want to i just want to
look for that um nobody hates star wars more than star
wars fans there it is we did we did talk about that
it's an interesting quote because i don't understand how it
wouldn't be that way uh i chose the side that takes away
women's rights we got we got we got like on this page
alone is seven rah super chats oh my goodness
yeah oh rah laugh my ass off that kind of neighbor
saying you should do femoid only efap if that ever happens i'll send in 70
fewage super chats i mean it wouldn't be possible to do a
to a female only because me and ryan wouldn't it be you'd send in 30 less so
that they get only 70 of what it would normally be
maths is hard as we've established this dream rags how could you say that
uh look at pro jared no thanks i like my eyes
unburned all right we're all nasty racists and
sexists speak for yourself rags i'm not a nasty
racist i'm a beautiful six foot three persian racist
all right he is a big persian man hey massives i was the one who cleaned my
record's last stream it was due to bed bugs
all clean now no bugs have a good stream love y'all
oh very good yeah getting rid of bed bugs is a big deal so
we can we can honestly glad it wasn't a new efap does not approve of bed bugs we
think bad we said bed bugs are bad yeah bad i hope
like that's with aden is like good night sleep tight and don't let the
bed bugs bite yeah there's a reason that phrase exists ryan we say it for a
reason it's important don't fuck don't fuck up and that's
bad uh
winton's ben shapiro take is literally the only correct
thing that lard bucket has ever said thy only i mean libertarians aren't human
rah does not think libertarians are okay all right rip hey aden glad to see you
on efap mauler needs to do avn next avn who's that
angry video video nerd any angry video game nerd yeah there's no
game i think most people say avgn but i guess avian is too right avian works i'm
assuming it's not that but we'll find out where chad is probably
gonna tell me what avian actually stands for
a movie starring alex jones and ben shapiro with quinton as the antagonist
what should the title be um that point is armageddon armageddon
this the end times are upon us brothers uh i would happily go with a couple of
different movie names but i can tell you for sure i'd watch it
alex i'd watch it i'd be there alex jones and ben shapiro working to
subvert quinton yes that's that's happened
quinton would just explode uh a couple of guessing avn means adult video news
don't oh yeah let's do that i don't i don't even know if that's the thing on
youtube but sure adult videos are like what mechanic
instruction manuals or like c-span reruns well i don't what
would an adult video yeah i don't quite understand
uh should romanceable characters in rpgs like mass effect be
player sexual wherein their sexuality is dependent on the player's character
gender meaning they can be romanced by anybody
um
yeah i don't have a problem with that i have i'd have to think about it
more but i don't think that's an issue sure yeah
like if basically if every character is bisexual just for
bit of player freedom yeah i'm fine with that idea
yeah uh where are we uh mola have you seen the latest leaks for
episode nine kylo being visited by han instead of
anakin and then dying like a bitch because luke and leah don't care enough
to show up and save him like they do for ray
honestly the leaks i have to read out i don't even think they have that in them
and that's kind of why i want to read them out
so we can address those ones even though those ones might not even be real
just because i do want to be surprised if i'm
honest but i also like the idea of speculating and talking about how stupid
some of the leaks are it's fun yeah well if you read a bunch of
leaks at once and you don't know which one which and happens to be one of them
it's like well you'll still be surprised because yeah
well in your head you'll be going no this could happen or this could happen
exactly what which leaks are correct that's the
the take uh did y'all see jeremy john's video all
right did you did you see it ranks i have not no he made a video basically
saying that it tied to the fact that george
lucas is feels betrayed by disney but it's a
disaster it's all a disaster that disney have
fucked it all up and it kind of makes sense that
that george is so upset and i was just like man
and people are looking at it like a moment with
jeremy johns has just come over to the toxic brood slash
the fan of menace good like nah we're done we're fucked
over episode nine's gonna be terrible and it's like yay
yay and hit it in a different way but yay uh but yes
i did see it and i thought it was quite interesting and in fairness to jeremy
johns i don't want to say this is like this first moment or anything he did
make that video about how the first order
suck so i think
he's he's always been on the side of things being kind of sucky
with the disney star wars films it's just taking him some time
well you know what sucks is in that video he shows a clip
of him watching the trailer if it's force awakens
he's like man i was so full of hope that it's like
yeah you looked back and you're like yeah join the club mate
yeah uh you are not alone 100 people on the millennium falcon and
10 times as many in jay's mum ha ha got him
oh shit uh give my gypsy shekels to aden blocks also
hi aden don't you leave me don't you leave before
morda morda reads this out she's here aden what do you think about that she's
here she has it left
see i think that's very interesting aden bring up a very good point
i agree yeah i never thought of it that way but now that you mention it i see
where you're coming from why are you here aden i appreciate that
it's fair enough thoughts on south park since 2014
i don't like them um all i have to say on south park is that they tried that
one season where they made everything serialized
and when i say serialized like the the storyline that travels through
as much as it has its own stories it's trying to do a season full bring you
would be better on this because i dropped out of south park before this
happened but i know that it happened and a lot of people cite it as the death of
south park while south park is still going so it's
complicated to say the least but do you know about this right metaphorical death
maybe they had a character representing trump
and a character representing hillary in this case hillary represented hillary
and mr garrison represented trump and they'd written the episode ahead of
time that hillary was going to win and the
they had a storyline for that and then trump won and they were like
fuck they had to change it a lot of people
felt that they'd fucked the season because the writing didn't
make any sense anymore a lot of things that were set up didn't pay off etc
and um people blamed that as part of what killed
south park but they survived in terms of plenty people watched the later seasons
so um i was never really into south park i caught an episode
i never really got into it i've seen some funny stuff i've seen some that's
just meh um i see why people like it though
some really good jokes this is the thing i need to catch up on it i'm not
going to have a good answer but i know that uh fringy would fringy
would be the guy you want to ask about that because he's much more into it than
i am i i fell out of south park around about a
year after trump got elected and it wasn't because
of trump or anything it's just i just fell out i stopped keeping up
keeping up to date um but but i probably should
uh mauler about to turn into a money launderer
i don't think so i mean look the reason superchats take a while is because
whenever i read one out i want to make sure that i answer it
in terms of what it's asking but if someone let's say someone superchatted
for a billion dollars hello rags you just be like bet your
ass i'm saying hello yeah but but if someone superchats one
dollar and says what's your opinion on the new rambo i'd be like okay and
this i could go on to that for like five minutes
it's not necessarily about the money it's more about making sure these
questions get their answers and so sometimes it can take longer
sometimes it doesn't it depends on what's said really
um just gotta make sure we get to everything
uh efficiently i suppose we do try we do try
i'm not sure how anyone polls failure is the greatest teacher
as tlj's theme given that the main character ray never actually fails at
anything uh so again as of exploring so many
videos that tell you how good tlj is they will argue that her failure is
believing in kylo ren her failure was to think is having too
pure a heart yeah her failure is to think that he was
a good person and she was naive and it's just like oh
and it's the thing when you when you're dealing with a character who's a god-like
paragon the only flaw they can have is as a result of being too good
and it's just awkward mark hamill talking about his character
discuss joseph campbell and the legacy of greek stories
daisy ridley talking about her character aha he he she put the dildo in her
vagigy stupid talentless come brain hole
is that reference i think i have no idea i think aden brought up the whole um
joseph campbell legend of greek stories but
okay so if i'm assuming ras taking a shot at aden maybe
i don't know but what is aden supposed to do with daisy ridley's character of ray
what do you imagine she's going to do with that oh maybe daisy ridley in her
interview maybe yeah
um yeah maybe you're saying he was comparing daisy ridley talking
character talking about his regardless there's the conversation almost
ends the second you talk about ray you're like oh well
she's a character um we did it there we go moving on to the next one
yeah just a reminder that quentin is an actual admitted anarcho-communist he
is physically incapable of having a correct take on anything
he is an anarcho-communist is that something he said or
like really it doesn't shock me it's just like
okay uh it's about time aden showed up also high rags hey
yeah she did show up indeed she's currently having a little snooze
but that's you know it's fine we welcome those on efap
for snooze here and there a little rest some odd reason fire is considered to be
hot relatively it's not hot compared to the
sun now is it yeah fucking idiot's thinking fire is hot
but caveman don't know shit you're stupid you're stupid first rags then
jay longbone that star wars girl and now aden paladin are you trying to start an
anime horror molar and i'm gonna say hey i can always i'll
take more of the hair yeah rags can share we'll have half and
half why do you why do you have to make it all about me
fuck yes rags blew himself up with a grenade launcher in
in alien saloon marines well that doesn't remove what about it
from being able to have a harem come on just because the game was retarded
enough to have f not be your flashlight but instead be your grenade launcher
agreed uh it's okay molar i feel your pain i was so pissed off by season eight
episode three that i had trouble being productive at work
it was i was absolutely livid yeah that was me
i still remember wolf was like what do you think of that episode
and i was silent for a while and then i was like
okay let me let me go through this and i said that my biggest issue was i kind
of think they destroyed everything by having
the white walkers be destroyed well before the end of the show which was
kind of where the show i thought was going but what do i think of it
oh i just think they destroyed everything yeah which is this is the
kind of thing where you sort of you say that and then you're like
man i'd probably be angrier but i'm my emotions haven't reached me
just empty yeah it's the one time that the mind is ahead
of the heart almost the heart is sitting there like
what just happened the mind is like oh let me explain you've just been murdered
and the heart is like what you've just been killed
this is what it's like but there's nothing after this is like
uh rags is cancelled i don't know what you must have said something that
upset ra i agree with jay for once uh ari
what he said about the indulgent visuals oh yeah fair enough also if i
remember correctly you guys said once that juju scenes looked like mortal
combat juju uh so that's the reference to jj
and again that would be tfa we were talking about tlj though
yeah um like mortal combat i think i think there's an argument for some
scenes for sure i'm just not sure which ones i'd referred to as that if i did
combat yeah maybe uh the movie mortal engines
costed dr evil voice 100 billion dollars
well didn't it looks really expensive that's the thing it looks very expensive
and it did not make it
uh stages i feel like he saw that tony tony zau
guy's kurosawa video and got fixated on the bit about kurosawa
using weather to externalize conflict very well maybe a lot of a lot of
creators will use the weather to accentuate
uh tide pod goes in tide pod comes out you can't explain that
come on dude it's not as complicated as man wait if you ate a tide pod hole then
wouldn't just poop it out because it's in like a little plastic thing
i guess they take it out of the plastic also i missed the reference wait
i don't i don't i don't think so because
if you're supposed to put it in yeah right
to like your washing machine well then surely if it breaks up in the washing
machine will it break up inside your you know your intestines and stuff
yeah but that's the bad part right that it breaks up in your intestine yeah
that's bad oh hmm the bad i don't know someone
someone who's an expert in eating tide pods can you get back to me
someone expert in tide pods just contact us
at efap.com uh i fucking hate quinton does he ever
think for some reason it's become a meme to ask why
five israeli mousered agents were dancing on a rooftop and filming the
twin towers across the hudson on september 11th
i don't think quinton was talking about that but i think you were talking about
that rah i guess that much uh yo efappers red letter media had a
great movie recommendation tomahawk bonesaw with
um no it wait is that what it's called bone tomahawk that's what the film's
called not tomahawk bonesaw uh bone tomahawk with kurt russell it's
really great acting is amazing have you seen that rags i have not but i'd be
interested i watched it because of the recommendation
that film has one of the most goriest moments i've seen
ever and it made me go who had it oh i don't do gore really um it's not much
in the film as a whole but there is that moment and i did
enjoy it it's it's a movie for the most part it's a it's one of them
westerns with them cowboys and they're shooting yeah yeah
when we're gonna get a wally unbridled praise
and ironically that will happen eventually i really do like wally
i can't promise when it'll happen smaller i recommended you when
seagulls cry it's a vn about murder mystery
antagonist wants to explain murders with magic
mc counters it with logic fighting plot holes anime vision is bad though
that kind of sounds like the um the sherlock homes movie with robert jr
the bad guy in that is killing everybody with quote unquote magic
and then at the end of the film robert jr explains
how each of the the things are done with not magic
uh yeah i liked it was good shit but that sounds kind of similar all right
i'm gonna beat quinton to death with his own limbs
while yelling anger leads to hate in yoda's voice
rah rah got stopped from sending super chairs at some point
and i can't imagine why yeah it's just i just
none's coming to mind uh maybe quinton's being so ironic he seems
unironic uh i think he's genuine quinton's a kind of an idiot i mean a
good person yeah he's kind of dumb so yeah
someone needs to make a clips compilation of the famoid
laughing at quinton and send it to him instant suicide guaranteed
oh suicide suicide not yes weirdly because of
you it um are you referring to contour points as
famoid or you i have to decipher all these super chairs very progressive
view to call her famoid um what's viscous chunky white
somewhat salty and was dripping all over my body last night
the answer ranch all right ranch why did you have i have even more
questions now yeah that's weirder than the thing that
we were all expecting ranch dressing i'm assuming is what
you're referring to and why would you have that all over you
have some standards happy huntings you massives
i don't think you need to know about the world's wars to enjoy star wars a
friend showed me the originals on vhs well before i'd learned about everything
jews have done and i still enjoyed the films
that's raga
space whales are literally canon in star wars
well um when we were joking about the space whales being
in a body of water in the middle of space you can understand how we weren't
referring to anything that's been made previously in the star wars films right
something in the eu books games media is probably going to be a bit
different from what we were talking about but i understand
uh space whales are actually canon in star wars you guys
they're in the time travel dimension at the end of star wars rebels
oh no yeah i don't think that helps the space whales in the time travel
dimension it makes me think that was actually a joke
we're gonna go ahead and just say like okay
back away slowly that's what we'll do uh and then there's just a super chat that
says whale wizards
all right there's a second certain lack of creativity that has come with
dot dot dot any sentence starting with that phrase is
worthless unless it ends with hiring women
oh that's rah again i think that you can you see there's a
there's a theme with rah and i'm appreciating it i'm noticing without
even necessarily reading it anymore i think that people who are listening
could probably pick it up i vote for aden being our new queen of
efab she is logical and has objectively the best laugh welcome to the toxic
brood oh yeah anybody who guess is a part of
the toxic brood whether or not they want to be
it's it's it's like a membership does not require your consent
yeah just on them they run away and it just it's like the
uh what do you call it the symbiote in spider-man 3 where they're like
screaming and slowly yeah covering them they're like ah
sorry this is happening you can't do nothing about it
uh quinton keeps popping up in my recommended despite never watching a
video from him what the fuck youtube maybe it's the fact that we covered him
maybe youtube's weird with that yeah hi aden good thing aden say hi
hey hello uh also hi rags hey also goodbye j
view the lord of the rigs he'll did one day
day uh mark hamill just turned to the douche side of the force check out his
twitter we did yeah pointing that was a shitty
tweet and he should feel pretty bad about that
i love how i can work a 10-hour shift and still be able to watch efap live
also hi rags and aden oh hello hello that was aden
at this point quinton should just spare himself the shame and off himself
oh my goodness jeez i don't know about that and what the fuck you censor my
super chats youtube i'm giving you money r words r words
is it m words yeah that was that was from lieutenant colonel tanya von
duja shaft that's not even raw you would have assumed that was raw wouldn't you
i would have been reasoning the existence of the tracker
isn't a plot hole the plot hole is them having a detailed blueprint of the
supremacy i still stand by the fact that him
saying that he's aware of it while simultaneously not being aware of it is
a plot hole them also having a blueprint of the
supremacy is uh weird looks pretty detailed i'm not
sure how i feel about that should should everybody have access to
blueprints of technology that's one of a kind i don't know that's a good question
um seriously though i hate people who hand wave logistics
i can enjoy interstellar and the dark knight rises because i'm not as autistic
as mauler but logistics mattering is always better
it's why i went from loving animu like attack on titan
and then it's a full stop i thought he was gonna say loving to something else
the focus on logistics makes animu kino also the
fashy themes how do you enjoy interstellar and the dark knight rises
while being a fan of logistics ra explain to me
that's that's a contradiction right there i'm calling you out oh
i've called you out just got here quinton taking shots at midichlorians
it's go time i mean all he said was that people didn't care about it which is
the one thing you can't say about midichlorians
you kind of screwed up yeah they did
quinton yo mauler what's your favorite monster slash monsters in monster hunter
uh tigrex and the only reason it's my favorite
is because once me and my friend who played a lot of monster hunter united
on psp found out that once you get the full tigrex armor
you get like a huge boost to the uh consumables speed
we were like we have to get it and we did get it eventually and it was great
the tigrex armor was really good um up until a certain level
yeah then it kind of turned into something i kept hunting for
and eventually something i enjoyed hunting a lot and it's kind of a cool
monster so yeah that's uh that's my story
also just in case this argument comes up technology in star wars has been
stagnant for at least 4k years and you want us to believe that not
once did someone think what if i ram them at light speed
yeah it's bullshit yeah that's that's an argument they try
every once in a while they're like what if this is the first time someone
thought of this and you're like no just no no no there is no fucking way
nobody like you know what like naval war used to be about ramming into everyone
else like that's one of the first things that people ever think about i was like
what if we just fucking ran what if we design specifically designed
like our warships to be about ramming it's unbelievable to me that it's like
what are you humans slamming a rock against an animal
that's like something we tried back in the first time we tried anything
slamming a thing into a thing yeah we would have tried that
that's it's one of our basic attempts it's like the idea that everybody didn't
is ridiculous but sure fine favorite buffy
slash angel episodes buffy would probably be once more
feeling angel would probably be not fade away
person they know what i'm talking just popped in
love you guys also high rat mauler hello
yeah about that they should have hired high tummy tanaka
if they wanted to if they wanted to asians for the sake of having asians
fair enough i'm not sure who that is jaja is more realistic of a character
than rose yeah i believe that i think it makes more
sense strange stigma against hiring asians back in 1940s maybe
like i said when we were talking about it i feel like unless you've got a very
specific example it's pretty hard to prove that people don't want to hire
asians because they don't like asians it's like really i i just naturally
assume that a lot of directors casting directors are dealing with a lot of
people who are acting and if they have 10 people and seven of
them are white one of them is black one of them is asian one of
them is i don't know if i can russian uh typically speaking you'll end up with
one of the seven and it just seems to be more of a demographic of what's in
america that could totally explain all of it
at the same time name a bunch of races and then say russian
i don't fucking know man i'm kind of still drunk i'm still drinking weird
oh black a bunch of white guys black dude and asian well hang on russian is
asian russian is a nationality still asia the russians are white
still asia almost no it's like a year is russian not
white no russian is pale completely different russian is russian is
noble completely different uh yeah it's it's the kind of thing that
can be explained by a lot of different things it's really hard to prove
but if you have that detail if you have that email that said i hate you because
you're x like well yeah that guy's a dick
fuck that guy don't don't don't be in his film he's a
bean don't trust that bean sometimes it's really hard to figure out which
peen to trust but don't trust that peen that's
yeah not all peens are created equal i guarantee you that yep
there's difference in peen a follow-up question with at alien dinosaur hunter
what's your weapon of choice
if that's directed at us i would just go with whatever's the best suited for the
scenario that's my
i don't i don't know anything master hunter still don't have a weapon of
choice rags really like i just in general
if i had to use any weapon like a medieval weapon
like uh like a medieval style or something like that
fantasy weapon any weapon of choice i am a big fan of
swords and how birds surely those are kind of ones that i've always
in the modern era oh yeah in a modern area yeah you wait i asked if you were
meant like medieval stuff and you said sure
well and if you mean like if you mean like a kind of gun
then i have an affinity for um just rifles you know just just like what's
your favorite rifle
is it is it the ar-15 it probably is yeah i'd say i'd say it is
yeah it's just so advantageous and excellent in so many ways it's just like
the best it's just the best ar-15 is just the best
the m4 platform is just the most amazing thing and then to answer the question
100 seriously i hate because you're gonna be like oh
of course you say this but this is the unironic answer i'm sorry about this
okay my favorite weapon in monster hunter
it's the long sword
why are you making jokes long sword why is that a joke
long sword
it's a long but what's wrong but why is that it why is it why is that something
to be fun of i don't get it so they call me the long sword it's a
fine weapon it's like oh what are the odds of oh the long man i
guess yeah i like the long sword i'm sorry okay
i like that's right and we got what looks to be
rose milk it's kind of like i'm not sure what that emoji is
this is the problem when you post something milk i gotta be like
i'll give that possibly reference yes a rose emoji rose milk what could that
mean oh no not a rose emoji oh like gross
tico or oh that could be it that could be it oh
uh aden is top bay sans in smash bros hi jay
yeah kind of primes yeah but i'm sure you'd be happy to say that
good lord most of my favorite n words in one place
hello wave's hand is dying
we're up to
11 plus three 14 hours
just 10 more until 24 right yeah just 10 more until 24
making a t-shirt selling my girl aden on efap hi j
how did you say hi to jay when you could have said hi to aden
aden what do you think about that
yeah that makes sense yeah i agree yeah that's fair enough
disney star wars has no notable alien characters i'm sure
asian diversity is a thing to be concerned about in a galaxy far far
away i mean yeah you could have had like an
alien that was voiced slash operated by an asian person you know
made them and they had mars canada she's voiced by blackman black wamen i
think you'll find not blackman
i can't let that stand rags that's a racism
oh uh i hate captain marvel because she could have been spiderman
um
what would make of that right how do you she could have been
asian she could have been spiderman i don't know
rose could have been spiderman captive marvel
oh i just i heard that captain have you heard this stuff about like
rumors that brie larson is going to be involved in the mcu
you mean star wars right
yeah because of course she'll be involved as he usually already is
well oh yeah yeah yeah star wars star wars um
all i've seen is that she dressed up as a jedi and was like hey
jedi cool and people are like oh my goodness
she's in the new star wars stuff and i'm like have we got anything to go on yet
and as far as i'm aware we don't but i hate to say it guys she was good in
room and she's not incapable of acting i
really feel like it's whoever's directing here she's really annoying in
real life i will give you that there are a couple of people who are
really not cool in real life while also good actors and so
if she was confirmed to be in star wars that's not a confirmation of
bad content who knows what'll happen i understand
the grievances
you liked ukulele that means you racist
uh checking out aden's channel holy crap she's a long woman
yes
why yourself a good long woman podcast works perfectly
who wanted rose to be white all of china
but china were like very much in favor of seeing more asian actors
nothing apparently not i think they just wanted to see a hot babe a hot white
babe really i know that they want to see like
crazy cgi battles because they love trans i'm just
because chinese are fucking the worst thing in the universe yeah
they're ruining like china ruins everything sorry chinese just ruins
there's nothing they don't have an effect on in a bad way
just like oh great you ruined this too because china was never
it's never been a thing like oh this is so much better because of the chinese
that's on the list of things never said ever uh if you talk to someone who
brings up race every chance they get chances are
you're talking to a racist also high rags hey i think that makes enough
sense in some way you could definitely i'm sure rob will back me up on my chinese
comments not sure if aden or rags is the better waifu how is that a discussion
i i'm sorry rags obviously but she gives it a good
gives it a good maybe the most competition you've had but still
definitely make gonna make me earn my keep you know
keeps me on my toes uh tlj fans are all sexually aroused by the slave children
i don't need evidence to support this claim i just
need to state it and it's apparently true if you're going by
video essay logic of defenses for tlj then yes you don't need to support your
arguments but yeah don't worry about it doesn't mean the mean rags are going to
approve of such an argument we might present
alternate evidence and but i understand where you came from i know how you
constructed that i see it i see the intricacies i see what you are i
see what you are saying uh admiral hodor our plan is to die
and before we do we will light speed into snoke's ship
sacrificing ourselves who is with me the asian hand
rises
asian hand rises oh we got rose tea going well but
i mean most people seem to be on board with their plan outside of like five
people who apparently you believe this i should have brought
this up earlier but if holdo told everybody and the
only people she didn't tell ended up mutinying
maybe she should have told him maybe she should have maybe she should have
told somebody like poe pulls the pistol on it and
she sees this other full people like yeah fuck you and then she's like wait
oh damn i forgot to tell everyone in the
yeah we're heading to crate this is a secret planet where we've got coverage
they can't see us is that all good and then they go oh
i put their guns down so we're not going to die okay sorry just
yeah that's pretty nice nobody told us how weird is that it's like yeah sorry
about that sorry i guess i sent out the message
and i don't know did you guys not check your rebel email
yeah oh shit we messed up technologies a bit
weird you know it can be it can be a bit of a dick so
it's understandable mauler ask the spider if episode nine is good or not
the both of the spiders that i saw are both not in the positions they were so
there ain't no asking them anymore the only thing worse than a spider is a
mobile spider yeah because you want to ask it what's
the plan it's like i'm going to crawl inside you and lay eggs and you're like
oh no no no no no please oh okay you are dying right now but if you
can't even ask it that oh no what else could it be up to you
know it doesn't even want to tell you that's how evil its plans are
that's kind of fucked up yeah rose tico should be telling holdo war is not
about killing the ones we hate but saving the ones we love
holdo was so morally bankrupt she didn't even care about the safety of the
crew oh wow yeah man i want to see that scene
where rose and holdo fucking have it out like
fuck you you know what you're doing she's like no you don't know what you're
fucking doing i'm an admiral she's like well i'm
maybe i may be an engineer but i have the heart of
gold that you're missing and there's this huge blowout and then fin is in the
background like i have no fucking clue what's going on
and that'll be great i would watch it he's like i should have stayed in the
first order these people are nuts i made a mistake
these people are crazy bring alex jones back he's 1000 times more entertaining
than quinton we don't we can't we can't control that
i'm sorry how much quinton may reference him
is down to quinton you know i wish i wish we were at the point where we could
just command that quinton be removed from the
screen and alex jones be placed upon it but
it's not power we have
if it was we wouldn't be doing podcasts we'd be out conquering the world with
that kind of power and then there's a suit that says
spaghetti bolognese all right i feel like nine could come out
tomorrow and efap would still be have you boys
heard that the last jedi is a bit terrible
i mean i honestly well in our in our defense
though have have you heard how fucking terrible the last jedi is because
it is a stinker man look uh like to not meme for a second i think
that we'll cover episode nine a bit but tlj will be the more consistently
covered one it's the one that fucked everything up
episode nine will be bad probably but episode nine man i think it's gonna be
shit i just don't think they i don't think
first off it's not necessarily even about whether or not they
have the capacity to make a really good star wars film
it's would they even recognize a good star wars film if they were
no you know do you remember in fellowship of the ring
where baramia as he's grabbing at frodo says what chance do you think you'll
have i like to get baramia as the chat and
frodo as episode nine what chance do you think you'll have
i don't know i'm gonna try and if he falls through in the end
then that's great yeah but i'm just i just don't
i just don't think that will be the case baramia
is gonna is gonna win out on that sorry fin the ptsd suffering slave soldier
who gets over it by murdering his fellow slave soldiers and buffooning
around the galaxy ptsd well apparently not because he he has
like that one moment then it was like in the moment if
anything is just battle stress or combat stress or
whatever certainly it's not really there's not a lot of
post in it yeah no yeah he's a clown he's a fun clown he's
like he's he's like the person who they made to be
the clown character is the last person who should be the clown
character yeah the ex-storm trooper
ridiculous we've been trained to kill since it was crap captured as a child
crap captured that's probably how they got him
when he was on the the loo yeah um awesome character hi rags heart hey
oh hello ryan johnson on holdo the fact that it's a woman
but it's a woman who isn't in a general's outfit but has a real feminine
energy seemed like the toughest thing that poe could come up against
there you go i was right as usual
what what feminine energy is like no she ain't a bitch
it was a dude he'd be an asshole she's just wrong
it doesn't have to be oh jeez okay well at least it tells us what ryan thinks of
women you know women yeah you are holdo that's
what you are real feminine energy or something
yep uh that feel when you suck at defending tlj you
start criticizing it he didn't do much criticizing it he
yeah he basically took all the biggest issues and then
off right off the bat in the video basically you said don't worry about it
uh quinton patrick cold you're defending movies wrong
oh shit i don't know if they've even they've even made a thing for that how
do we defend movies correctly i don't even know
uh interesting topic by defending the right movies
if you were tasked with writing episode nine how would you do it
you can go in any direction you can do time skips and do retcons but it has to
be a sequel to tlj well it's only a sequel if you interpret it
that way so a thousand years of the and ironically i i would have luke wake up
return of the jedi we've got that kind of freedom i'd do it
it was all yeah man because like the the new series is fucking borked
the world building is just oh man it's just it's so bad i know it's a meme
i would unironically do it and i would hope that the audience react to it in a
positive way i'd be like the opening crawl
hmm i don't know how the opening crawl is kind of worthless i don't need it
i just need luke waking up in a sweat being like
fuck that's what happens if i allow it to happen
and then the trilogy is now about luke trying to stop it
you know doing what he can and it works out work the way we
i'm not doing it's all a dream is a terrible way to write yes it is
it is i agree wholeheartedly but hey listen desperate times call for desperate
solutions you give me that i will write the rest of it in a much more
sense just give me that just give me the dream sequence
it's all a dream we need to we need to cut the head off the snake and just
start out we need to cut our losses basically i might even go as far as
having a little intro in the film with me and rags we sit down on chairs
and we sigh then we look up at the camera and we go look
we were tasked with making this film let me explain why you
seed one professional movie makers did such a fucking shit job
yeah that they had to call into a bunch of amateurs who actually give a damn
about star wars and look yeah this isn't what we wanted
i know that we're all stuck here okay we're gonna work on one this even though
the millions are paying us does help but we didn't want that
and that's what we would do we would do it that way uh note to self create a
series of memes saying that memes are bad i don't know
thanks to me they're just unequivocally amazing
memes the best thing ever i love memes memes are great
memes are the lifeblood uh hi i have heard for something to be
objective it has to be quantifiable measurable
eg kilometers can be used to measure distance
and so movie elements cannot be measured and so they are subjective how do you
respond to this that kind of harkens back to what i was
talking about before to um i guess you to do another analogy
i've talked about before you have a house and you have a pile of rubble
now the pile of rubble is not a house however
what are the process between the pile of rubble in the house all the different
stages and i'm talking about establishing the uh the foundations or
putting in the um what's the uh what's the foam
insulation that sort of stuff insulation the paint decorations different things
that go in there all of these different degrees of how
much the house is a house uh depending on i haven't talked to
builders about what makes a house a house but obviously i have a rudimentary
understanding of what makes a house house what i'm trying to say is what's
the difference between that pile of rubble
the thing that only has the foundations the thing that has the foundations plus
the insulation and the walls the thing that has all of that plus
decorations the thing that is completely done
to identify those differences is to create the scale
uh because none of them are the same as the other
but they still represent pieces of the process and so for every
fuck up in a plot line it uh represents a piece on the scale
versus one that's completely fucked or one that's perfect
he's zero to 100 and i understand it's like wait so more what is the number in
which tlj is fucked up and it's like well i can't give you a number but you
can understand yeah it doesn't necessarily have to be a
quantity so much as and one of a binary
and it's like is this something yes no yeah
most planning authorities have definitions for a building yeah again i
don't i don't know it but i'm trying to just relate it to
another thing so it's more understandable than me just relating it to
talking about yeah whether or not what it what that
standard is really is a building or not it's just does it adhere to that
yeah a house is where your towel is
that's true you need a towel uh all the towels that i own are at my
house so yoda the ultimate troller
uh just finished episode 52 i get hating on closer looks video essay voice
because it's freaking annoying but i don't get criticizing doing a
voice in general mola critiques mola's critique voice is
different um i mean my my video voice and my
e-fap voice if you will the only difference is that i don't
flub anything in my video voice yeah it's really just it's just it's the same
voice just very clearly and precisely none you know so i have plenty of bad
takes on e-fap i will often there you go take a break or like
pause or repeat a sentence while in my videos i
don't because why would i want to show you guys
a moment of me repeating myself if it wasn't for the sake
of repeating itself it's it's all supposed to be my
best takes of every sentence while with the closer look he
agreed that he just doesn't sound at all
like himself in his video and this was something that a lot of people noticed
before we even had him on we were like this is not um instantly
yeah but you don't sound anything like you're gonna you don't sound like you're
talking to us like a person and i'm pretty sure i sound like a normal person
in my videos i just sound a lot more confident and assertive compared to
being drunk and 14 hours into a stream i think i think there's a difference i
agree
jaja did nothing wrong hashtag yes old jedi
all right there's a book all right there's a book that's canon
that has the force ghost talking to luke the whole time
why what were they saying yoda's just like man so you came here to
kill yourself and he's like mm-hmm he's like
oh that's fucking pathetic no no you wouldn't say that
you would he would have to encourage it because obviously we see him he hasn't
changed so you're just like yeah man that's probably the best thing
kill yourself you must jumps into that thing we were talking where he tries it
and he's just yoda stomping him just trolling him
this is an awful movie uh yoda watch those people on the new
republic planets get blown up and laughed about it
well pretty much he's having fun yoda ghost is having fun
you know life is it is this also play kotol 2
please i and i'll get around to it at some point
i i'm sorry this is also games i gotta play
i'll get around to it
all right thoughts on dnd from game of thrones in charge of kotol
so the idea is that they're going to be making an adaptation of kotol into
movies like a trilogy and they are the people who
made season eight of game of thrones so is that not concerning and it's like yes
it is but they also made the earliest seasons of game of thrones
so maybe this will be but a lot of people assumed that they fucked up game
of thrones because they cared more about sealing the deal with star wars
yeah we're done with game of thrones it's moving star wars and it's like um
okay what happens when you get your deal after star wars is that just gonna get
turned to shit too yeah maybe their first movie of the
trilogy in star wars is amazing maybe it's great
and then maybe the second movie is 50 50 and then maybe the third movie is
terrible or maybe it's all terrible or maybe
it's all great we'll have to see um but i'm assuming it it doesn't spell
good things considering what happened uh with with game of thrones
anyway i i thought trump was a myth no no no he became president he he won
um oh he's super real season man yeah he's real
happened shuster is my family name it's jim and for shoemaker
oh the shuster they must look at the shuster
in the fire new clothes for us our feet our feet close
ruse wayne disappeared for many years in batman begins
no one said he was a myth they just thought he was dead
the star wars universe works differently the second you disappear you're a myth
oh
morning lads have some dosh that reminds me of killing
grab it while it's hot luke is an a-hole for handing layer the dice
agreed it's really insulting to hand her the dice and the fact that she found it
meaningful it says to me that she has no idea
what they actually mean but lucky for me i saw the movie solo and
so i know what they mean
yeah hey your your your your lover had a girlfriend this was
so unbelievably awkward number one you got aiden paladin coolsies
number two high rags hey number three to the person who bought
the rhino milk t-shirt i apologize you got the one with a spelling error that
says the dom instead of the dawn my gravest apologies
sorry that person yeah balm instead of the dawn
don't imagine this as the dawn
oh man all this luke talk is reopening old wounds
it still hits f u constant yeah that makes sense sorry about that
now this stream is what i'd call good rat well good
oh this is a good rat street it's a good rat kind of stream
hey guys i've been making the yoda would have counseled luke the entire
time argument since i first saw the movie
but luke cut himself off from the force so would luke see yoda
um so if luke cut himself off once he arrived at arc two then it's up to
yoda to have talked to him from that point up to then
um and then from there onwards and then there's still
force ghosts that could have discussed things with kylo this is the problem with
the force ghosts until you tell us what is and isn't
possible we're stuck to assume that certain things
are possible and when you see yoda someone lightning
we assume he's able to do that on on a lot of things
but um i think there's a strong argument to try and make it a bit more believable
that luke cut himself off from the force and thus cannot be
visited by force ghosts but the second he reconnected
shouldn't yoda why gone obi-wan like dude what the fuck where'd you go
everybody turns up for like dude
you're the only place looking fucking change all of this together what the
what happened you're all like you went off light you
piece of shit
um i don't know how people can find any fun in mindless films if you want a
peaceful rest have a bath why go to a cinema
apparently that's a quote from park chan wook
yeah that's not a not a stupid yeah i mean there are some films i like to see
as maybe i'd like to see his mind doesn't
really think of what films do i consider mindless
um the expendables yeah
even though there was a moment in that last expendables that was kind of nice
with uh antonio benderos and yeah i kind of thought that was nice
i only drink a little i almost shed a little man tear
what is beer milk i feel like that wouldn't they wouldn't mix well
beer milk
i feel like you get that whole um what is it called when milk does that thing
where it turns into like curdles that's probably it yeah where it's like
pieces of it and you're like i feel like beer would do that to milk
beer milk i don't recommend it your milk oh god
uh my wife and i bet on how long this would go she bet eight point five hours
i bet 10 hours wonder which of us was right
neither of you yeah but i guess you were closer
that would do whatever the bet was uh also loving aden and high rags
hello also mooja and chat i i see you i see you i got you
i see you you're noticed what did you do what do you say
senpai rags notice rags oh and then emojis oh notice rags
senpai rags notice rat notice rags i guess you noticed rags
uh hey guys i can't stay long but i just wanted to thank you guys for having a
podcast long enough that one can last my whole shift
my question is what rpg classic would you best
would best describe you guys
an rpg classic that describes us
hmm yeah i really i don't i don't know we could we could call ourselves the dark
souls of podcasts it's difficult to complete us
this do you want to complete us
i'm gonna stick with that that's gonna make it to the end
yeah aden's gonna pop back up i swear to god she's gonna she's gonna wake up
right before we finish or something
yeah all right uh love you boys that's nice they got a little finger
emoji and the okay symbol so it's the um the
intercourse symbol as you might call it that's very kind
this is not the best podcast ever it's a tribute
that's a tenacious d reference high five good stuff
um i'm loving this listening to efap while eating calzones and drinking
surge drinking surge so i'm assuming that's it
that's like an energy drink yeah and watching the old star wars in the
background this is a great way to spend a weekend for me thanks all
no problem you're welcome happy to help for clarity i'm working on something
related that's from alan gothic
oh he said he's working on something related to the question what rpg class
would describe you guys i read that wrong rpg class
that oh what rpg class describes us yeah i guess we could pick a bard
or bard i pick i'm a bard
problem is don't the classes change based on which rpg are playing so it's
kind of like well there's generalities oh name a
couple of generalities and then i will pick one
uh warrior barbarian knight paladin bard assassin archer or ranger
a wizard uh cleric you know stuff like that
i'm gonna go with rogue ones you said well you didn't say at all yeah i went
with bard there you go we're a bard and a rogue
very entertaining and i like to talk and speak and i like being the center of
attention but i'm also very very supportive but i can demoralize my
enemies as well they won't even come onto an efap if i'm
there a couple of people have said i'm a wizard and mage fine i'll be a mage if
you want me to chat decides to give up rags is a bard and mauler is
a battle mage okay fine i'm a bard mage fine i'll be a
mage and i'm a bard and i also have lots of guns which
makes me a uh a looter shooter
mauler is a wizard because he can ramble on for ages is that a thing the wizards
do they ramble on for ages i don't know about
that that seems racist to me meme alchemist that's something a bard
would do yeah uh anyway nah quinton will never
have my respect also my heart hates ugos ugos oh that probably
aden what do you think about that raw says i'm the max charisma warrior
like okay aden's making noises oh yep yeah i knew that she'd come back
you said it how you doing aden wake you right
good morning good yeah it would be morning god
the sun streamed so when i said that this podcast is long did you think i
met this long
you know we're not even close to the end
why am that's for sure we finally made it to the super chats yeah we did we've
been reading them oh really we had there's a couple of ones
for you as well uh one of them says oh give her a moment
to get lucid maybe hey no no no we need her to not be
lucid aden what are your thoughts on adoption
on a dot on what on adoption
you could just come at me with this kind of shit what do you what are your
thoughts on adoption answer now
good
the dawn would be proud i'm okay with this
this is a good answer uh what did i save any other ones i
two i got fenna fenna fenna more wait a question for me
oh no that that shat shat shat shat shat shat shat i've got eight questions for
shad holy shit chad what's wrong with you why do you
make people ask you questions it's wrong i think the other ones were sort of like
high uh aden so you're all good yeah you will
fall asleep probably before we hit the end of this stream don't worry
just you're fine just by the way you've outlasted j despite
the fact that you've slept it still counts so you know that's a valid
strategy to say fucking i'm sleeping through
you don't have to stay you can literally leave and go to sleep it's
totally okay it's not in the rules yeah well at this point i've just been
asleep i i don't know um you know that
that's pretty scary oh i can't believe we've been through two
sleeps for you me and rax is still here just like you
again what i told you is that like i'll stay
hover long however at some point i'll need to sleep
again it's totally fine i just find it amusing
uh all right what else is left for hollywood to ruin
at least the princess bride is safe right no
oh don't tell yourself that yeah we no nothing is safe everything will be
killed eventually uh the skeptics with a single most
counterproductive group on youtube being one makes you seem like a
sargonite far tougher make 50 minute video on that ap
oh i guess ap would be you aden yeah um
i don't know i don't have i don't have an issue with the quote of what skeptics
however i feel like counterproductive groups there's got to be one that
outclasses the skeptics oh yeah i mean were they counterproductive
100 but there's got to be like a group that literally destroyed itself
like because like i said it was already a loosely defined group that isn't
it's even more loosely defined now and they're all still like
going there's still a thing yeah it's not like the
art is still fine or anything yeah that's that's a big part of it too
is it like oh yeah they all got uh skeptics over it's like
how like we're all still here yeah you know what whatever though it's not
like i mean yeah maybe some of them well i guess if you take
any groups of them won't turn out well oh chat is saying bathwater question
aden okay i have to ask aden here's the bath question yeah go for it all right
so if you drink oh sorry if you drink someone's bath water
do you deserve to get herpes oh yes i mean oh sorry rex
lost another one to wolf see i thought aden would
we would be on my side and would say no but i mean okay it's not like it would
be cool for you get herpes but you you're consuming someone's okay
here's the libertarian position right which is that
do it about wilst essentially but if what that wilst results in you
drinking bath water that's riddled with herpes
and you don't know you don't know it's riddled with herpes
you did it for verification you're drinking bath water
yeah i mean in this scenario you did it because
you you're drinking the bath water of someone you respect
in some way the reasons you adore i know for instance you drink you drink
what's-her-faces bell delphine's bath water
sargon of a cod right you you drink i drink sargon's bath water
yes yes do i do i deserve to catch the liberalism
dude that that's that's how you obtain his powers
no here's here's here's my thing i don't think you deserve to get herpes from
drinking bath water and i will present i will i will present this argument to
you aden and i think after i do you'll be on my side all right go for it but a
lot of this comes down to how you know how we define what you know
deserving essentially so if you are uh like a a kind-hearted
uh monk a missionary and you go out to a leper colony to try and
help them and soothe them and do stuff like that
just take care of them do you deserve to catch leprosy
yeah wow you say wow they really i mean you're hanging around with lepers
you deserve leprosy for helping lepers
yeah rip rags holy shit wow holy shit wow all right let's just be
honest i mean i like i'm not it's you're a good person and good on you you've
done a good thing but you probably deserve to have leprosy
you good people deserve to get leprosy i mean if you're hanging around with
lepers now are you now are you are you conflating
like it is a a logical result of the actions you take
with you deserve to have something happen because of maybe i maybe i don't
understand the term deserve you see this is what i said this is what i said
this is what i said exactly thinking that my way of looking at it would
when you say deserve would be a logical conclusion
of but you mean deserve in a moralistic sense i
yeah i i think that when i talk i'm definitely definitely going with a more
moralistic sense of deserve because i think that i can't really
make a fucking statement on that i don't i'm not a fucking philosopher i would
say that if you if you go around hanging around lepers
then then logically yeah you deserve to get leprosy
that's i want to say logically you deserve it well let me put it this way
does that mean that every person who goes
to a leper colony and doesn't get leprosy
we should give them leprosy so that justice is done and they get what they
deserve i'm not a gift-giving i mean they can do whatever but
but justice has been served they they deserve leprosy but they didn't get no
it's not justice saying deserve okay okay that's not the way that i would
look at it because i don't see this as justice at all
i'm just saying deservedness as in well you can't really be surprised
do you know what i mean what if a so let's say you have a baby who uh
gets away from his mother or whatever and runs into the street right does that
baby deserve to get hit by a car
uh probably i mean it's wow okay all right
next super chat
it's a darwin award yeah
i'm not saying that they deserve it in a more now let me be clear again i'm not
talking about any of this from a moralistic sense
i'm just saying deserved as in an outcome or a likely outcome of
a series of inputs and if the series of inputs
is absolutely brain-dead kid trying to yeet itself
um you know i i think deserve it i think an
inextricable part of deserving something is
having the worthiness for rewards or punishments
and i think that's impossible to separate from some kind of a
a moral tension that's a moralistic way of looking at it i i would say that
i i mean i i don't know like i i have things i think are immoral and moral but
for me personally i just think that um if you did
something that has a statistical probability of
resulting in x y or z then to say you deserve x y or z
is appropriate in the description just saying so like 50 percent
no it depends it depends on the statistic i mean it depends on what it
is i'm just saying though is that if if you work with lepers all day
you kind of deserve to get leprosy jeez statistical standpoint but do you
morally uh think that that is no there you go
rags there's your answer you're looking for
then morally it's not they don't deserve it but in terms of like um
a series of logical events absolutely but it's a series yes it's a series of
logical events like oh yeah here we go this makes sense i'm holding fast i'm
holding i'm holding i'm holding this ground i
ain't getting i'm not giving this up i will say i'm giving this up more people
side with wolf than with you i find it all very fascinating well
they're wrong they're fucking wrong okay rags fuck them up
i this is my hill just like the definition of literally i will not
literally sputamen godzilla the wall and listening to godzilla was terrible
godzilla was terrible spiderman homecoming is amazing
the wall is meh and literally does not mean figuratively
this is the legacy of efap by the way we talked about because
literally also has like a thicker definition
that literally's definition can also be figuratively and i'm like no it fucking
can't that way to say it literally could mean
not literally and it's like what the fuck no
it's like we already have something for that called sarcasm
that's its own special little rule you can't just say
oh uh blue it means not blue tall means not tall
but yes that was so funny guys i've literally died it's like no you didn't
literally we've had everybody answer this question to some degree and it's
always about how you define deserve which is the main main point of
contention some people think you morally deserve
to get leprosy if you help lepers i suppose
some people i don't know i can't say it the moral deserve it in this day you're
doing a good thing i mean it's really hard to describe i
guess i mean you're you're a good person you're doing a good thing so you don't
morally deserve it but you should also be just aware of
reality see there you guys see chat i knew that she would agree with me once
i chat uh this is from marcus waters he says i think she means that if you don't
take the proper precautions and end up getting leprosy as a result
then you are deserving of what you receive assuming sleep-addled brain
yeah like if there are ways to avoid it and you don't take those precautions
then kind of you earned it it's what some people might say i mean
that's just yeah no i mean i mean that's that's in
the same way that if i i don't know i went into a volcano to rescue a child
that had fallen in there but is still alive and i didn't
put any precautionary gear on you deserve to
to be burned oh so hard because i don't know i mean if you if you go in raw in
a whole bunch of situations and you end up with the gift then
you know can you really who do you have to blame but yourself just saying
i was going to say like what if i didn't have the gear on me and did it because i
wanted to protect the child it's like you deserve to get burned it's like well
that point is going to be a logical conclusion but it's not because i wanted
that it's because i had no choice so i think it's a fascinating discussion i
do i love it right i ain't budging i ain't budging
i don't think you should um it's all good so the next one says
skeptics are literally just anti-sjw's who
aren't alt right slash wn wn w oh white national oh all right
are not white nationalists that's the one thing that like ties all
alt right people together so that's like the
thing you're an anti-sjw if you are a skeptic who
isn't alt right slash white nationalist so yeah so you're 99.99 percent of
anti-sjw is correct remarkable i guess if that's how you
want to define it remarkable republican says he wants to
debate you okay so when we cover like uh closer
look who describes endgame as being flawed
because it's not enough like helms deep or that it
doesn't have progression all these other things there's so many
talks to cover when we covered remarkable republican
the main points of contention were whether or not luke
was a lesbian whether or not c3po was a gay butler
and whether or not tywin lannister was the apex homosexual
i understand that he would like to debate these points
but like i'd have to remind him that it doesn't matter
too much if you'd like to debate them or not it's not i'm against having him on
but you do get that if he was to debate whether or not c3po was a gay butler is
not something me and rags are too concerned about
either way if he was to convince us that c3po is a gay butler
i mean what what really is gained or lost yeah that's what i can you know i
just i'm like okay so like if he wants to debate us on
those subjects i just i'm not sure why and if he wants
us to debate us on other subjects which we did not cover in the efap then i
don't see why that would be relevant i have heard
that he wants to make a colony of people on mars it's not something me
and rags covered in the efap we covered him
so if he wants to talk about that you know you can make a video whatever but
you want to talk about gay butlers or gay
hands of the king in game of thrones sure we might we might have him on discuss
it but i mean me and rags are not too desperate
to discover whether or not but also who cares we yeah that's the thing we
really don't care that much it could be but i mean i mean i mean
really who cares whether or not c3po is gay
or if you mean you don't want to know
isn't it obvious he's always been a little bit flamboyant i wouldn't be
surprised but i don't care oh racist do you think he like
do you think between like c3p and r2 like there's something going on there
right oh of course there's something i'm not
gonna so all we have to do is determine r2's
gender and i don't i don't i don't think there's
anything sexual going on between them i think they're more like two old queens
you know what i mean like they're just there's
i mean we can hear c3po side we can hear r2's of them just
like being old bitches about stuff you know
just complaining about shit
yes that's that's the take um oh my god losing your cool
in the middle of a fight is different than murdering someone in their sleep i
don't know why this needs to be explained so many times but that's where
we're at yeah that's referenced to uh talk about
the differences between luke in one film and luke in the other film
but yeah why are you talking about star wars star war is coming out
star war star war yeah star war what is star war you don't you don't
know star war is this whole thing rags explain it
star war is about the space wizards and it's meant for children so it doesn't
matter how shit it is oh there you go yeah there you go sounds
great it sounds like a product that i can get
yes
seeing footage of the ot cut next to quinton's face makes my childhood vomit
oh we didn't that's not what efap is after but i mean
we can't promise what reactions everyone's going to have to everything
you know we can't we can't ensure a safe environment and that you know that's a
flaw we have to work on it uh dragons are just lizard wizards
lizard wizard i can't are they are dragons magical uh
depends on what what universe we're talking about because
in game of thrones they're considered magical
in i don't think they are in lord of the rings
right are they magical i don't know i don't know we'd have to consult wolf
yeah wolf would know um or the ghost of jr our token
or the ghost of j died i had to ask that professor
please me high cheek sent me high me high cheek sent me high would know
peace they would know big idiots that's another person who would know
we don't have access to all of these people at hand you know we have to wait
to send these messages to them by raven uh molesbury is just an e wizard
go with that shadow thirsty is a christian right religion may be bunk but
dissing the religious shouldn't be a big part of your content
i mean is he a christian or is i forget which mormon
yeah mormon so yeah yeah sheds uh he sheds uh he's a mormon man
but the idea that we shouldn't ever diss religion as part of our content
there's nothing we don't diss in efap nothing at all there's no limitations
if any guest wishes to do anything about anything
say anything about anything usually encourage that all targets are open
uh polluting religious uh because because why would we want a
particular section of people that is immune to such things that seems like it
would be of a big bad wouldn't it
let's make fun of uh we can make fun of uh atheism yeah
yeah so let's do that let's do that now just to show that we can do it
well to give you an example in the boys the show
they have an episode where they make fun of religious people
and when i was listening to it as an atheist i found it really awkward
because it's like oh my goodness they're rolling out arguments that i heard
about 20 years ago like why'd you believe in god there's no
proof lol checkmate yeah it is kind of like oh
yeah you nailed it good job guys and there's like a
a decent portion of an episode all about like arguments like that and i was
like man this is uh old i think it's just because that
anyone who's militant about a belief is annoying
whether they're atheist yeah whether they're atheist or not
it's just extremely annoying to be around people like that there's no one
you can't make fun of it's really easy you just gotta find the worst visions of
their collective they always say stupid stuff
uh you could do a straw poll to see what percentage of your audience
consider themselves religious i'm sure we could we don't really care
though i don't really care you can be atheist
religious or everything in between which i don't
think is a possibility right as long as you're not a Scientologist
gotta draw the line somewhere there's gotta be somebody who's like oh man
rags doesn't like Scientologists he doesn't he doesn't he doesn't uh
believe in the holy
z who's gonna fuck you up right
hello oh ron who better
i'm seriously okay uh my dad and i were talking about problems with the whole
x-men franchise and he unironically says movies are supposed to suck anyway
they're just good for killing time what who how sad this man's father wolfman
jack said that's what his dad said oh sorry your father's got an
awful opinion on movies what did like did a vhs tape fall on his
head when he was young what it was well i guess it wouldn't be
a vhs tape it's like it would be a the film reel and it did just just a tv
did a tv fall on your dad's head when he was a child and he just hates
all cinema or uh he follows up with saying this is the
problem with modern audiences i mean my my dad would never say that
and he's he's old too yeah my dad would say that either
just turned 67 in my dad's shirt and certainly would not say that shit so
hmm i'm sorry about that show him some good movies and then explain to him why
they're really fucking good and you should take him seriously
there you go done easy people are just too apathetic about a lot of aspects of
movies so they'll just eat up whatever dribble they see
i mean because on some to some level it is
that sort of like consume product um enjoy
get excited for next product because for the average person
there isn't a lot of investment they're just going to
you know amazon or netflix on their smart tv
and clicking a button to purchase something because
that's what they're supposed to do and they have nothing else to do
yeah so i understand some of the apathy and i understand some of the
just resignation to well i guess i'm watching this now yeah when you ask them
to think about all the plot details they're like what the hell why
just watching this to have some fun i'm sorry
i don't fuck up your day just keep going yeah let's carry on though i'm
starting to get a little tired and it's uh five in the morning for me
so yeah yeah all right uh
what is this no one can hear you christmas in space
a grimace grimace what would you do if i came into your
house and a goblin was threatening your family with a club while your family
cowers in the corner
i would i don't know i i carry a gun with me so i'd probably
use the gun as a means to convince the goblin to
convince the club i would pay the goblin that's what we've learned from efap you
have to pay the goblin and gold ingots
he gots out go outside and push the dumpster
uh more or sometimes you need to just drop acid and surf cotton's point
on another note does whales have any surf for your fellow
surfing welshman
whales have any surf for your fellow surfing welshman are you talking are you
asking yeah do you got the big waves dude we got
the totally radical waves the problem is we live in britain where like
weather is completely inconsistent you go out and you're like yeah it's the sun
and then a blizzard happens seven seconds later and then it stops
17 seconds that wave was like totally tubular
radical yes these hot pockets are totally tubular mrs b
who's mrs b i don't fucking know mrs
i don't know i just feel like it's a 90s hot pocket commercial and i just have
any idea yeah anyways actually the first time i ever
had a hot pocket was uh we used to there was a little um
pool a community pool but it was next to the
um golf club the like uh so we wanted to get any kind of snack we had to walk
over to the golf club snack store and they hated all of the the kids
coming to use the pool because we didn't have to pay to do it
they just hated us because it was at this fucking resort
and they're just super mad we'd go over there and buy hot pockets it was awesome
just pissed them off for being a bunch of kids coming over into their fucking
golf club fuck you man
so uh my first hot pocket i had when i was in college
so what is a hot pocket uh it's like a sausage roll
but oh that's what you mean oh is that what a hot pocket is
kind of is it like it's like it yeah i think me like pizza ones and a
different flavored or like hot pockets you pop them in
the microwave and you heat them up so it makes the outside really hot but the
inside's still really cold and people love it
terrible because of how hot the inside gets it's like a toaster strudel
you see all right but i mean because the problem is that um
or like i don't know if you yeah it's like a sausage roll essentially except
for like full of pizza or something so that when you heat it up or like a
pasty you know like when you heat it up though it gets
full of molten hot horrible shit whatever if you're moving to britain you
gotta know this stuff because pasty pasty means something else
what does it mean is that what you put in your nips yeah okay
pasty thank you i i am in four days so i should
it's like a it's like a little meat pie is a pasty is like a meat pie
no pasty pasty a pasty is a meat pie yes pasty is
a skin condition i don't know no it's a it's a noble thing
appearance pallid actually the way that i discovered what a
what a pasty was is because um i was having a st patrick state party
actually and my friend's friend
showed up and wanted to show off her strong independent femininity
i guess she was a friend of a friend i got you
and she had um four leaf clover pasties yeah
and it was just awful and also and and not to be rude but
nice girl but but she was very very heavy and very overweight
yet the same way yeah it's gonna happen you could be heavy while thin right
jeez 350 is big a big girl but had the unfortunate tendency or
whatever that she had absolutely no tits so it was like oh no
oh no those are the important flaps i know it's just like you had the
it is like one lost the short straw twice you just
wow you just got nothing going for you and that's a shame because i think
chicks i think lean healthy chicks with a flat
chest i think it's really super hot myself so if you're just fat with no
tits then you just you're just like the michelin man you've lost
you're all you didn't got nothing going for you
i can't it's like i can't run my hands up that and like
grab a sensitive little little chest or something you know
oh it's just like you're just fat and just
reach in and grab it and pull the fat away and then
i mean like if i let go of you and a noise happen
you're too fat whoa i think in general if you let go of someone and a noise
happens that's they could be many things wrong at
that point uh we we can't confirm yeah
like if i grab you and then you hear and i hear that
yeah like there's too much of you
it's too much of you
i was like i like you but there's too much of you
it's just too much too much it needs to be less i need less you in my life
what you said i've gotta i've gotta kick off with these things and look at you
explaining in depth i'm sorry we got we got to talking about
boobies and fat chicks and i had opinions on both
i just had to give them i want to highlight that he cute in chat
said at mauler he said ooh that's a reference to futurama and
it's a very good reference rags you'd love it it's a good reference
it's very relevant to what you were saying but i'm gonna leave it at that
the next one says fat flaps for sure can you guys do an efap
short on a status i believe that's to do with a 40k thing
i know that what would you like us to say other than it's like really cool
we're not we're not big into that's the thing and i've got no reference for 40k
so all you'll see me doing is going that's cool wow that's talking badass
and cool oh wow go uh get um just go bothered
uh arched no it's already did it though with like sargon and stuff
yeah we gotta just bring him on to talk for all of us
plus arches a cool guy just bring him on and yeah
i don't know i don't know i'm not interested to do it
yeah rags is the only person on efap in terms of a regular that couldn't do it
and if he's not that interested that we're just i'm
i'm just not really that interested in the topic to that point
uh 40k in general uh not doing the video about it like i really love a star test
in the the animations i really really like it i think is freaking amazing
but doing videos about them
stop sending super chats i will never be able to complete this shit if you keep
sending like seriously we actually we've been going for
like four days i don't have a contingency plan we're nearly at four
hours of a second stream what the fuck am i supposed to do about this
look this is not easy okay all right let's just keep on going i can't
wait for episode getting money well i i'm not trying to say that it's
just the fact that how do i make this normal
the idea that i'm gonna have a full we're we're nearly at four hours and
this is called the super chat stream that's insanity i don't know what to do
about this other than continue and i gotta stay awake too
i think i can do it it's gonna be one two three four five six drunk i had time
taking that i've still been drinking it's six hours until i'm up
your liver has been working over time to keep up with efap
in six hours i will have been awake for 24 hours which is supposed to be a
fucking meme but apparently we're about to actually
venture into that idea that a normal episode of efap
can extend to the length of a 24 hour efap which is supposed to be a special
but what do you want from me i don't know
all right there's no point in complaining i'm going to kick on
i can't wait for episode nine where we find out that monday matt is not the
father also hi rags hey not the father i mean i don't know if
you heard i don't know if you heard his kid
his wife's oh fuck i thought they would refer he's like one of us like he was
the father of one of us i was like oh no no he's not the father he ain't my
daddy he well he uh there there were some
leaks from his discord where recently i don't know what i think i
guess monday matt's sad that he doesn't have anything else to do
so he just is trying to start some shit with randos
i don't know how old those leaks are they have to be relatively old because
he talked about whether or not he was going to go to meth con this year and
stuff meth but um hey man i was a speaker um no meth
con i thought you said oh meth con oh no definitely not at meth
con but um tim pool always talks about it do
you remember that i don't know if you listen to tim pool but
if you haven't i'm mixed race tim pool yeah
if you haven't listened recently tim pool's gonna tell you about a couple
things one he's gonna tell you about how he's a mixed race
two about how he's still on the left yeah did you know that he was homeless
oh and he yeah yeah yeah i i love tim but homeless
talk about that stuff a lot what do you mean homeless
starting to embrace that it's a meme which oh i love that he's embracing it's
a meme it makes me very happy but uh he's constantly been talking about
this event that he helped sponsor and that was the event that i was at
with a bunch of other people i mean start on and uh thank and
i mean well shoe and skeptic were supposed to be there but they they
canceled um a lot of people canceled um why is
that oh is it because they oh yeah they went
back on their thing down yeah yeah i remember i remember because
the antifa said they were just gonna like burn it down and kill all of those
it so i get why people are are a little bit afraid to talk
is my point i would be afraid to talk at methcon as well
because i mean they're you can't really trust them they're going to be out for
a fix right sorry i i got i got off track the
reason why it was important about why does methcon shit
is because monday and matt started talking a bunch of trash
about the quartering and a whole bunch of other people
all because it's like oh oh yes he oh it all got leaked all of the um
these discord recordings of him just being
really rude about other people but he did the exact same shit with me where
when i when i first met monday matt two years ago
um i was at methcon and it's i as soon as i like met him i was like uh hey
dude you're kind of an asshole because it
was right after the whole he got found or not two years ago but a
year ago that was a year ago so yeah a year ago
so it was right when he got in trouble for the flagging thing
yeah and i i told him what everyone else told him which is that like yo
dude people will forgive you but you have to pay some penitence for that
yeah you have to actually make some kind of a fucking effort to show you're sorry
you can't just make a tumblr post and call it quits oh he tried so hard though
he wanted that to be it it just didn't work
we all did and then he he at one point he was like hey
aden oh because at this point by the way i
had offered him a hundred dollars to debate hard bastard
and then tonka said well this is back when tonka saw was doing stuff
said put a zero on it so at the time he had eleven hundred dollars and then i
think someone else offered up like 300 just to get him to debate
hard bastard on something oh yeah and he refused to do it he would have scored
how much in total i think it was like it would have been
like thirteen fourteen hundred dollars just just to participate in the debate
for an hour even said yeah even i said like i i won't do it i'm not a very good
debater so you do it with somebody who actually knows their shit
more than i do um but now he refused but at this at this event last year right
um he he basically the one where now he's talking shit about
the quartering and start on other people in private
he was like oh get a picture with me aden and he he's like here i'll i'll
we'll draw a little fake uh silver play button on a piece of paper and you can
hold it and it'll be like we're trading it off and i'm giving it to you
and uh you know puts his arm around me and stuff like let's take a picture
together um and then about like two months ago
after this happening a year beforehand
goes and starts messaging him and jeff holiday like they're connected at the
ass which they definitely are start messaging
the organizers of mythcon and the event this year
being like hey did you know that aden paladin is a holocaust denier
oh and wow and i just really wanted to say
wow matt real interesting of you to want to get a picture
to be opening your mouth like you just saw a new nintendo switch game
putting your thumbs up with a holocaust denier really makes me think
really um when you have something like what happened to him happen to you
there's no low you can steep to anymore because nobody believes you anymore
nobody thinks you have integrity anymore so
what can't you say go nuts yeah because he didn't he didn't go through the
the effort to redeem himself therefore he's just i don't he's super jealous
he's also by the way if you're making nothing from youtube and with the
numbers he's pulling he's making fucking nothing his patreon's basically dead
and he's spending the bucks to go out to mythcon
like you know who you are right people hate you
almost universally he didn't like you're one of the internet's case studies now
you're spending all this cautionary tale in person there's a reason why you
don't do what he did well yeah i mean one thing that nobody
accepts is trying to take on other creators
because it's fucked up the last thing we need is a flagging war
because no one walks away from that it's like the wmds
of you know it's the nuclear deterrent where it's just nothing but spamming
takedowns and the cold war of the internet
but like in a bad way yeah it's like something
don't do it just don't don't do it no one wants it to happen don't do it
don't flag people monday mat sucks i like boulder memes that's my conclusion
on that yep boulder memes make me smile moving
on at jayaxee you will go home and rethink
your life i feel like that was said before and
a pasty fap of course he will he did he's probably asleep right now
uh he's trying no he's seeing that he's trying to whistle he's trying to learn
how to whistle he's embarrassed by the fact that he come with
um i'd be embarrassed
yeah i'd rather they leave the classics alone don't make sequels to them all
and make new original movies that leave the old stuff alone
yeah that'd be nice you're not going to do that though
the only way people aren't gonna see their new crap they have to take
old stuff and ruin that well they gotta get people in the door like oh look at
this old thing there's this thing of like i think that'll happen soon like
we'll get the the dnd or the ryan johnson trilogy that has
nothing and i mean nothing to do with the prequels or the ot
and we'll be sitting there like thanks guys you destroyed everything in the ot
and then you made one that was disconnected from them
would have been kind of cool if you did that in the reverse order
not that i um yeah would have been just kind of cool if they had
in any way i don't know one either followed
the road map that lucas laid out for them
i'm not saying that would have been great because we know georgie
doesn't always know what the fuck he's doing or frequently doesn't
or just done old republic stuff use the expanded universe
actually use stuff that's already written well some people argue that
that's what they've been doing they've been taking extended universe stuff and
or expand and ruining it again
has been twisted and converted into like a horrible vision in in what we see in
the sql trilogy like kylo ren is supposed to be the
character who why my memory is very phasy on this but
some who is it something solo who's the character from the
kind of universe no the son of that person in the extended universe that
disney decanonized something so jackin is that it
so some people see kylo jason yeah i i don't know if it's jackin or jason but
the the point is the disney decanonized but then they cannibalize
like parts of the extended to make their own thing but they make it way worse
and so on solos kid like really force sensitive i'm pretty sure it's very much
applicable to what happens to kylo and that they just took
this is that they liked and then they made their own thing and it turned out to
be way worse that's that's that was my and so when you
reference anything from the extent so when people say like oh my god you
should be bringing in thrawn my immediate response is like guys
you know really want them to do thrawn what do you think they're going to do
do you think they're going to do exactly what you want or do you think they're
going to ruin thrawn and as an advocate for homecoming
spoodman uh yeah they they could make a thrawn
that's completely different from what you want
while is good at least consistent writing wise
but i'm going to go ahead and assume they fail on both fronts they make a
poor adaptation that's poorly written as and so let them do whatever the hell
they want to do anymore souls is pretty much destroyed and i say
that no in fact they can resurrect whoever they want
whenever they want and fucking ruin them as proven
with the emperor also someone said since when can we call a cold war good
mauler i don't think i ever said a cold war is a good thing
sure so better than a hot war again it's better than a hot yeah
you gotta put things in perspective a cold war is still is better than
than a than dropping bombs and then another comment was maybe the spiders
i'm gonna flag you as i go i'm gonna maybe back
i guess you just gotta put things in perspective though well so maybe the
spiders are trying to warn mauler about the duration of the stream
that seems like most likely for like oh aden do you know how long we've been
going for since we started well let's see it's been 12 14 out 16
yeah since i start i think i think since i organized the call
with me you and sorry yeah no wait me 14 hours no no wait j rags oh and i
there we go um it's been i i'm using maths 14 hours
possibly in an erroneous way but it's 11 plus 4 it's been
14 hours to first called me 15 and a half hours
about oh god really yes well well i had a nap so i'm fine you got
two i will keep going exactly well the first one it was only
10 minutes i only fell asleep for like 30 minutes the first time i swear to god
your your your sleep noises were adorable you're fine
cat loved it oh no that's absolutely terrible
you made it through it's okay people are okay with it it's fine you can look over
the the vod it's just we ask you a couple of
questions and you don't answer i assumed it might have been because you
were sleeping but i think the logical answer is you just you were offended by
the questions and that that makes sense i i mean it depends normally i'm not
offended by almost anything so
anyway uh
is the super challenge says the reactor six mix
i don't want to make of this the reactor six mix
okay mauler talking about star wars never thought i'd see the day
i will i'll let people know and this is this is an unexpected thing
when we when we cover star wars in any way shape or form there will be people
in the chat being like mauler are you serious you've talked about this
since it came out can you please move on and it's like
you watch efap we don't cover star wars every episode okay
and when you don't cover tlj for an extended period of time
and then you do later from the perspective of someone who's reviewing
it's like of course new things can be brought up
you know it's it's okay but if all of the same things are addressed
that were addressed two years ago i'll be honest with you the people who
are addressing them slash creating them are probably not
going to remember what was said two years ago
and thus will probably treat it as a brand new thing that even if they say
one to one what the new thing was that the viewers at the time will probably
be okay with it you know that could be an interesting comparison
what i'm trying to say is i'm sorry if you felt like this was repetitive
but me and rags deliberately delay the responses to tlj content in order to
try and come across as non-repetitive and yet no matter what happens when we
eventually cover them there will be people who say you cover
something else we're like but we do regularly i'm
sorry all the time we cover a lot efap at this point is grown
where if you looked at the list of topics we've covered
it's absolutely insane like i'm going i'm going from whether water is wet
all the way over to whether or not an olive is a weird grape
these are debates that have been had okay
not even referencing media at that point i'm just
you know so okay i'm gonna continue now giant coconut crab spiders
live on coconuts
i guess rags is referencing how it would suck to be apparently they're delicious
so yeah it would suck yeah it probably would suck
but crabs are delicious i'll eat the fuck out of a crab
it's called crabs are yummy this applies to the first human who saw a crab and
was like you know what carl i'm going for it
oh i'm gonna eat any kind of crab that i see i'm gonna eat
oh yeah like any animal you know if it's an animal man i'll just
eat that i'm a big eater you know and yeah i've kind of mentioned how spiders
spiders like can can be creepy on their own merits but
a lot of animals will have animal name and then animal
to sort of describe to you what kind or what version of this animal is and so
anything before spider just makes it more creepy to me
especially if i say shit like elephant spider i'll be like
oh god elephant spider all right that's okay
what how big is it you're like i don't want to tell you spider i'm just gonna
yeah and so what do you have crab spider bird eating spider i'm like wait
what literally human bane spider you're like
right human bane okay now he sounds like a cool dude
i'd talk to him man's bane spider the bane of man
yeah so yeah don't be a pussy widow maker spider yeah
hell yeah oh wait are you guys aware of the k19 widow maker
that's just his gang name you can't homes you can't be
hold him to some kind of accountability just because of his gang name
you guys aware of k19 widow maker k19 widow maker
you're putting them up to it kind of again not to say this is a tenacious d
moment but chat are you aware of the k19 widow maker and i'm not saying this
is some kind of like history guy i'm literally just referring to the
movie with harris and ford and i believe liam neeson but um it's a
horrible story however and i don't think many
people would say it's a great movie i don't know what the current
position is on it but the k19 widow maker is
is a russian submarine that went wrong this is this is a very rudimentary
terrible paraphrasing of some guy explaining what this actually is
but it's about a submarine that had like nuclear shit in it
or like radioactive shit in it and it went bad
like quote unquote bad because i don't really have much more specifics for you
and a group decay of the half-life that one whatever that was
and so a bunch of people had to go into the core and do a job
that could prevent it from exploding and causing major damage
and um it cost them all their lives and it's like a
super dupe wait for Chernobyl uh maybe i don't know if it i'd have to
look into because i already saw no one i think they all lived oh no it's not
Chernobyl k19 is a whole different thing but um oh
okay okay okay but many would not survive Chernobyl you know but the
elephant's foot yeah yeah yeah but well what i'm talking about i mean the guy
the guys who went in i think only like one of them died
and yeah this terrible accident a lot of them a lot of people dying yeah k19
specifically the the the people who never mind we're talking about two
different groups of people right k19 uh is a whole different thing and
all of the people who went in to solve the k19 problem if you will
uh all i remember from the film i need to watch it again
is that the people in charge knew that whoever went into the core just
let's just for the sake of the argument let's pretend you have to hold a button
for 10 hours and each person could only hold it for an hour at most
and once you hold it for 10 it solves the problem but every person who went in
there for even 10 minutes or more was dead
like they'll be as good as dead once the radiation has taken over and the people
in k19 basically told them that as long as you
wear these suits you'll be fine but it was like a yeah yeah yeah and um
yeah it was it's kind of like a fucked up
intimate storyline but it's a thing that happened apparently i don't know enough
about it it's just the fact that mentioning stuff
like that reminds like widow maker is is what i think that is referred to k19 is
the sub and it's referred to as the widow maker because it killed a whole
bunch of people russian again because russians apparently don't know what
they're doing when it comes to nukes that's all i have to notice a common a
common element here because if the soviets
involved
the goggles they do not sing you can't reference simpsons the middle of
serious widow baker things anyway uh what if the knights of ren are the
friends we made along the way hey no
on youtube movies empire strikes back is 12 dollars
the force awakens is three dollars that says a lot
it sure does is that true i wouldn't be shocked at all
because so many movies are really really cheap to rent on youtube
because whatever it's called i feel like um oh according to the chat
because i do want to make sure i get some of this more right than not
according to ron von richtberg the the nickname
widow maker came before the sub was even operational
ah well they planned that shit and they knew ahead of this one oh this one
oh they knew what they were doing this little
fucker it's like uh which uh which ship was i
deployed to uh it says here the widow maker
oh and an os sp says k19 wasn't actually called widow maker that's just the
movie the actual submarine was nicknamed hiroshima
is that true okay people look to google for this stuff because all i have is a
very bad news all right yeah bad just bad news bad
should just have been called bad news bearers there you go
that appears to be the the truth of this shit i get it though
me i probably said a whole bunch of shit though some people are listening like
mole is full of shit he has no idea what he's talking about
i know what i know how you feel i'm just referencing a movie i saw okay i don't
know anything more than that you're gonna have to google uh all of
these different things to find out more i still find it unbelievable that
there's a nine dollar difference between renting
slash watching empire strikes back and the falls awakens okay
that's my main contention here and you'd think it would be with the reverse but
it's actually about tfa being three dollars if that's true that sounds
ridiculous no because i don't care because
because dude the the movie is terrible they're trying to make anyway they can
off of it and they know they know that people will
pay 14 to rent a good movie yeah
bayou had said this ship is called you're all going to die welcome aboard
oh man it could just be a nickname uh the next one says the nights of
ren with a jedi academy glee club
i never watched glee but i don't regret that decision
i keep getting told it's terrible anyone here seeing glee
no oh god no all i know about glee is that community reference it in a way
that's like glee sucks yeah pretty much that's what i know
about glee as well is just from community references
uh ren means love in japanese the nights of ren will prove rose tiko right
no no no no no no no ren does not mean love
in japanese holistically you say then i
okay you know this as well as i do very nice
very nice very nice very nice yeah there you go
you got it very nice you know what people who
don't know the context of this stream are gonna be like wait moly you do it
another 24 hour i'll be like no no we're up to
full plus 11 15 damn it hi rags hello you prefer the male
gluteus maximus or the female gluteus maximus
i think i prefer the female gluteus maximus and the question
too additional to that is why do you prefer either over the other
i just like the the females just tend to be a little more
shaped they just shaped a little bit differently
uh it's just that i just just more attracted to
uh women in that sense at least but you know it's not like a
big deal it's like i like them both quite a bunch
um i guess if i just had to choose and maybe it's just like a current mood like
that's what my current mood is i i don't i don't even know i don't even
know but that's just kind of how i uh how i feel i like those wide hips you
know on a lady hips hips don't lie they don't i've
confirmed this with science uh is your guest one of those women
dale wentland would prefer to discuss star wars with
oh dale right dale wentland dale is a man who says that all of the
women he discussed star wars with are more concerned with discussing
the characters and the themes and and like discussing it positively
while all of men are very angry and critical
no um you can absolutely be critical of something
now okay women have a propensity towards being
uh towards getting along and and trying to smooth things out so i get that i
guess to some degree but that's also boring
as fuck if we just all agree did you enjoy film that was made for
your enjoyment yes i enjoyed it thank you very much
let's move on to next film did you enjoy next film
who the fuck cares boring shit talk about the stuff that's wrong at this
point i know that you've seen efap before i feel like yeah that's
some feels like you directly pulled it from efap almost the idea that we
cannot fucking tolerate conversations where they go
i liked it i liked it too
what is that a conversation that's that's that's brain death oh sorry i
missed out the important part aden i respect your opinion
now we've got a complete conversation that's that
oh god oh it makes you want to be sick but yeah it fares dale didn't really
dale didn't didn't support his positions when we asked him does he really
think men are ruining star wars he like was
immediately on the position of no we're like oh so why did you say that
and he's like well it makes people click the video
it makes people click the video oh my oh that kind of stuff
it's funny because um i i've admitted as i think everyone
who uses this platform can admit to using some
clickbaity tactics either in the title or in the
your thumbnail or whatever and it's not like it's clickbait i'm still telling
you what it's going to be but i have been called out so much for
being a clickbater and it's funny as shit
because i don't do that crap at all not in a real way
because compared to how these same people will do it
of we're gonna have an epic discussion about
this movie no you're not you're i don't have a huge issue with what
most people call clickbait yeah because it's like yeah you want your title and
thumbnail to get people to click on the video
or else like that's the whole point you want people to watch your content you
got to convince people to do it basing your thumbnail
just don't be dishonest about it yeah so if we if we talk about bait
so like it's like you present a thing that's not actually there
um in in reference to like fishing you'd be like this is food and the fish is
like oh and it's like no it's actually your death
oh wow you really baited me into thinking it was x when it was y
so when people say clickbait there's different degrees like if i say oh my
goodness daisy ridley has dropped a bombshell
and you click my video and then i have an article with daisy ridley said yeah i
wasn't too happy with a lot of the directions they took
in the sequel trilogy but you know i thought it was okay overall
you're like it's gonna be a fucking bombshell
and so yeah it's almost like so it depends on you to find bombshell i
suppose but then you can lie and you can be like
i don't know george lucas kills kathleen kennedy and you go i meant
metaphorically she killed he killed her when he said that he didn't like her
i killed her in minecraft in a video game yeah in a video game
so uh yeah different degrees and this is something we've talked about before but
we'll probably talk about more as time goes on so clickbait is a whole thing
everyone does it differently there um dale pretty much admitted to us that
he did not agree with the title of his video even but he put it there so that
people would click oh integrity here's here's an interesting
question actually uh because i don't talk to a lot of
other content creators very frequently how much work do you put into your
titles because i sit around and and like worry about them
for like a day so they're practically made
before i even make the video when i when i get ready to do something
personally if i've been working on a video for a really long time which i
usually have been i think i sit around and think about what
the fuck i want the title to be for like days
um and not out of just a clickbaity thing but also like what's
what would make people interested in it and you have to think about that stuff
because otherwise people won't want to watch your crap
that's just i'm the rally when i'm making the video i don't really think
about it sometimes a good title just comes to
yeah yeah i get it start the render start to upload it it takes a long time
because that's usually when i do it too
it's the fps an hour long so i have plenty of time to think
and then i'm like okay well um how about that's that's uh
and then i get distracted and i do something else and then when it's done
uploading i'm like oh fuck i kind of have a title
that's pretty much where yeah that's pretty much what i do as well so
it's really tough the title like what you're going to call your video is
honestly sometimes the hardest part i'll be honest in terms of i think that
i think that there are some people that who kind of start out with like
titles and ideas in mind and then build a video around it and that's just sad
and lame i'm very like i like to be brutally honest in an almost
tempting way like did you really title this
the stupid is a super chat stream i'm like yeah that's what it is
oh but that's not very enticing it's like that's what it is
and so you might be like oh so you like to name things exactly as to what they
are i'm like well yeah i'd like to argue that
all my unbridled rage series have distinct moments where i'm raging at
the thing i'm talking about and then vice versa the critique of
series is me critiquing in analysis extensively or what a thing is
the moolah channel is probably more you could criticize my titling but i still
think like i've never titled anything that's not what's
what you're getting in the video um but yeah some people are talking about
tall biscuit it's like tall biscuit was one of the best in terms of
labeling a video exactly what it was um once i always remember is stuff like
uh a video in which i talk about microtransactions for 40 minutes
i'm just like thank you i'm gonna click that because i want to hear you talk
about microtransactions for 40 minutes like you know i mean it's just it's
almost like a transaction that's the most honest you can imagine
and he's very much an impact in terms of how i want to
label things interestingly it's a it's that's actually really interesting to
call what youtube viewership is as a transaction because it is it's i'm going
to give you my time and in um transaction i'll watch some ads
and give you money even if not directly but it is essentially a transaction of
goods and services that's really interesting
yeah we all do do it differently and there's all different degrees
i'm gonna kick on with the next hell yeah because oh man i've still got
10 000 left oh my god just got back from a five-hour
drive thank god i have efap to unwind with
you literally unironically have 11 hours plus
four hours and 19 minutes currently who knows how long that may last
uh aden do people have a moral obligation to do what is ethical
uh moral obligation in and of itself is subjective
i would say that all this and what is what is what is ethical is subjective
we're talking about subjectivity upon subjectivity upon subjectivity so
um do people have a moral imperative to do what
no uh no because it there's too many variables there
to apply that unilaterally i'd say no in most circumstances
and the second question is is there even a purpose
of having a distinction between ethics and morals
uh yes because uh ethics are rules to live by morals are personally held
beliefs
yeah that's kind of how i've always assumed they are so like uh
you can see an action taking place and you immediately go that's wrong
but you don't even necessarily know why they may not have reached an
it offends me ethically maybe it makes sense
yeah so for example the the um the eating of animals right
you can say morally this offends me because i don't believe that animals
should be killed but ethically um i understand why other
people are doing it because they need it for them to survive
right so we understand that there's an ethical and moral debate that are
disparate from each other in terms of the eating of animals for example
ethics are more societal morals or more holy shit
rajas said ethics and morals are absolute and they're ordained by god
okay and he followed up with saying anybody who goes against that will burn
okay uh super chat all right uh join the long side of the force we
have better movies we also have better beams
we also have longer ass podcasts true i can
you could call this a long podcast i guess yeah to this degree yeah
starting to get there i'm starting to i'm starting to fade
have you guys heard the new i would like to have i would like to i haven't had a
smoke in in 20 hours man i'm gonna have to
pour a new drink bad for you bro smoking is bad yes
drunking is bad but smoking is worse yeah don't smoke see we're promoting good
health on efap by keeping you away from cigarettes
look you've made me sit for so long i haven't been able to smoke because
normally i would have had a lot of smokes by now i want to like okay we
did it when i sent you that message saying hey
are you aware that how these things go on for a while i will say this is absurd
okay this is longer than i expected i didn't
expect this wasn't what i meant when i said it goes on for a long time
i was taking that so i'm fine but wowie wowie indeed um have you guys heard the
newest leaks for episode nine apparently palpatine emp blasts the
entire rebel fleet by standing on the ground of a planet
and force lightning into the sky and reaching into space
hitting them yep jeez holy shit i i didn't even
hear that leak myself but anything is that's insane what you need
what you guys need to learn wouldn't be shocked is don't react in a bad way
react in a part be like yes that's gonna be great that's gonna be so
much fun to watch that's gonna be so great you know what it will be a lot of fun to
watch that's true it'll certainly be fun to watch
i mean not in the theater or anything i mean at home
uh right just destroys all the probably videos that fall down
they blow up yeah all i see yeah that's that's great it's gonna be bad no matter
what how about we commit to being insanely bad
instead of just okay bad you know let's go let's go crazy
that's that's my take here i'll be right back continue
all right damn ifep has a guest that speaks woman
that's yes we we've had women guests before
i say that as if we've had more than one or two
but yes star wars language huts hutties de wene wanga
i mean i'm assuming job like star it sounds like a star wars to me i don't
know we do wanga probably something they say i'm
gonna go ahead and guess that that's something java said at some point for
sure the vulcan salute is a jewish symbol
it is it is actually something that leonard nemo he saw as a child when he
walked into the the temple he saw the um the leaders of the the jewish
community he was in give each other that salute um
so yes it is it is actually not um i did not specifically do you wish it
is specifically jewish but it's also specifically vulcan
uh when slav squat around heels touch the ground yes
we know exactly where in the stream these superchas are coming from
uh
apparently that is written in mandalorian yeah sounds like mandaloria
sorry i don't know anything about i don't know anything about their language
sorry my dude neither do i but mandalorians are cool
blingons apparently don't have a phrase for sexual harassment
oh no um i wouldn't be surprised i mean how would you have to say it
you just have to say like you have to say like gender violation i think
i don't know as long as they got something close to it they can survive
the meme wars sure important part
have you seen grand torino i have oh yes i thought i was going to be
um his last movie but he i'm pretty sure he made more after that right
he did he's still making movies yeah i thought it was gonna be his last
well it was great though and then the follow-up says it should explain your
gookman question you talking about grimace i think you're
talking about the pursuit of chink and a gook
yeah but i like to just think that clint eastwood has a big
a big issue with grimace it's like i'm gonna fuck you up grimace
and he's just very angry and he's just looking at his purple skin
and he's very upset about it uh gook is a racial slur used by american
gis in vietnam war well that's only going to be beneficial to jay and he's
not currently here so oh right right okay so it was it was a
it was a joke of um it was from uh
shit what's it called um saturday night live
where they were making fun of richard dixon's like oh dick always used to say
that uh not every uh every chink is a gook but not all gooks are
chinks like it's it's a fucking old as fuck ass
racist joke very old uh okay mark hamill is a jick
evanka trump posted a picture of her kids in star wars outfit and he said the
force is strong in my family which hamill said you misspelled for
yeah we did cover that that's it's not cool not cool
kids don't have anything to do with the what what is the the saying
from i think it's game of thrones actually uh
that the john snow is like all pissed at denarius and she's like i
would ask that you don't judge and snoop the children by the sins of
the father and then he's like i would ask that you don't hold
the children to the oaths of their parents and i was like man let's get
shit uh except i didn't know they didn't
yeah i'm obviously referencing that uh this says arsh please give this 100
to kyle ps kick kyle but they they super chad two dollars
i don't know where they go 100 from
but also arsh isn't here it's 100 pennies
ah so they said dollars though
don't you can't hold them that kind of standard of numbers i mean that's that's
a lot of that's a lot of numbers man complicated
um can you imagine being the kid that drew this monster thing
thinking he was scary and produces turn him into a joke i think the kid was
probably happy with the absorber off the kid was
probably like man that's really cool that my thing got turned into a thing i
i'm sure he was happy it's okay probably yeah i'm sure he was i
would be at least yeah i'd probably even as an adult i'd
be like man my little drawing got turned into an actual episode that's pretty
cool even if it is a tismy episode i mean
you'll you'll regret it when you're an adult
and look back and go oh fuck but it's as a kid it's gotta be awesome
hmm uh i just hit 1k subs and would love to do a Buffy stream with Aiden and
mauler the zeppo is my favorite uh my pick for
favorite episode zander's finest hour the good episodes
pretty cool to see at zander in general at any time we get
some kind of just nice character development for zander i'm
always on board so it's a really cool episode in general
though it's like it takes us a second to poke fun at Buffy as a whole at that
point which it's only his third season and it's
already trying to be meta about the almost tropes developing it's the best
show it doing that in terms of immediately becoming meta about itself
um even star gate didn't do it that way and it's also cool for zander how do
you feel about zander's eye oh i love that he lost his eye that
shit uh it's so like horrible to watch but you
also want to talk about like something that's been set up
for forever is zander having the original
quote-unquote training via the halloween costume position
uh of military stuff and ending up becoming
um it much as with i don't know how much you'd like um or know about
uh the avatar the last airbender universe but he becomes the soca
of that group so hardcore he's the same character soca and
and and um and zander i would say yeah i don't know i don't know what you're
referencing with that but for it's accurate
it's pretty good i will see it eventually i swear
uh wait rags have you seen at least uh last airbender
like the movie or the show the show no in the movie oh dang no okay so i'm
the only one that can make that reference but yeah it's it's
basically if you like uh avatar last airbender uh
it's the character development is very very similar
in um in zander from buffy like i said i will definitely check the
show out of it oh the next one says jay is right space
bulls isn't funny i didn't realize that we could have a
host and a super chat be so wrong in the same
two pieces of shit in the same stream that's pretty crazy
yeah that's wrong which is wrong it's one of those
science proved it i spoke with science yesterday and the first thing he said
was by the way space balls is funny and i was like yeah
yes science that's cool i understand i know but sometimes science likes to tell
you these things just in case you've forgotten us
anyway uh meld brooks is overplayed
all right jay i hope you get an incurable rash for that statement
wait that seems like a mixed message jip meld brooks is overplayed but
want jay to suffer for saying start space balls isn't good
because meld brooks made space balls yeah but so
like the first half seems critical of space balls the second half is critical
of jay who said space balls is bad i'm not sure then hmm that's interesting
you're thinking and writing writing in particular is really hard
man like it's super fucking difficult the next one says like thank you
wesley is the best character change my mind i won't be changing your mind wesley
wenden price is the best character no no oh that's fine but wesley wesley from tng
now we we don't know that one the other wesley the better wesley
uh jay what about the producers 1960 1960 okay let me
jay hasn't watched anything from his time why would you ask he hasn't watched
anything why would you ask if he's watched
something from a time that he doesn't even know existed
like jay's not aware of even what time is he's just like oh cool everything
exists in one plane okay i haven't seen lord the ring he
hasn't seen lord the rings okay so there's no point asking that but
i understand that the need to this is depressing uh
next to chat says stop making me want to watch buffy
no no to see buffy stop watch buffy it's great
watch it and you might at first be like what are they talking about but once you
reach certain seasons you'd be like oh i know what they're talking about
it'll come it'll happen and the next one says wesley wenden motherfucking price
agreed saint chef agreed wesley wenden motherfucking price
have you seen firefly yes i watched the full season
several i want to say twice maybe three times not several but um
yes i've seen it i like it it's good i'm on board the idea that it should never
have been cancelled but what can you do life throws you
curve balls uh the borg queen was first in captain eo
michael jackson disney world show which was produced by george lucas so star
trek ripped off star wars it yes um i don't know if i'd say that
but um well the borg queen stuff is already
terrible it's just bad bad writing all over but the captain i o stuff
at um the star wars adventure whatever it was in disney world yeah
you could definitely make that argument
almighty protector of the sun and sky i beg of the please heed my cry
transform thyself from orb of light and bring me
victory in this fight i beseech thee grab our humble game but first i shall
call out thy name wing and dragon of ra
that's from the cursed okay that's from yugio yeah it's like
to duel and i i don't know i don't know but i i'm gonna think i just made that
up but it could be i didn't even know that
oh yeah man you know there's some things you just don't know
and then there's some things we're like man i wish i didn't know
because uh anyway this is my favorite episode of efap now i don't care
that was that was sad yeah i was gonna say i don't i think they're referring to
the older one i yeah that was a pretty good one that was
pretty this one itself pretty shit though you have to admit
yeah pretty pretty lame well no this jay's not in this one really so true
that's a plus jay was in a lot of the other one not that bad
most of it even feel a kick i do young skyle waker skyle waker
for reference and this is i was only told this
but being told it is enough to reference it's so funny
i was told so when they uploaded the first
trailer for uh episode nine they didn't call it the the name was rise
of skyle waker instead of skywalker again no confirmation of
actual truth there no screenshots it's probably not true i just find the
concept funny that they named it rise of skyle waker and they're like
fuck i change it quick go to the youtube editor
um anyway made a big mistake i immediately regret my decision
i could picture the bead like we change that it's like we probably should
people some people still care about star wars okay
i guess so um the next one says abort j
rags are you okay with this abort j uh it was there is it abort comma
j it just says no it just says abort j oh well too bit too late for that in it
in a way he's been aborted from the stream yeah we're right yeah
uh so where's your granted mr mr little golden window there
it's a nice one says i love you people you give me life
very nice i'm sorry but thank you this is worse than pikeman in episode 50
okay what are you referencing this which part
was it when someone was saying something in some way about something or was it
quinton i don't know but a lot of people very much enjoyed
the pikeman in episode 50 i have to say i believe
i believe he is a good one he is the pikeman you can't you can't box him in
try and judge him with any word would be inaccurate you gotta just accept it
but go with the flow uh art like this is why people shoot up
schools but what are you referring to lj as a whole
oh yes so i don't know about that at
like a book about something weirdly gets interpreted you know
oh maybe they meant the the shrek stuff jenna pointed that out yeah that's
probably what it was actually the shrek stuff that's where we're at right now
you guys remember the shrek meme good ones i do i remember baby we were at
uh humans are animals aka long pigs super tasty yes i'm aware of this that
we were referred to as long pigs by cannibal tribe slash people
long pig delicious i mean if we taste nice what am i you know what are you gonna
do exactly me starting to make good progress
catching up on efap nothing mauler i'm gonna end this man's
whole life starts efap 54 um yeah you got where are we at now
four and a half hours on this one 11 on the previous
there's lots there's lots of tisms to catch up on mauler do you like hentai
i don't watch it so to like or dislike isn't really possible
don't go near it so it's not a genre slash content piece that i am
grimace versus goliath loser becomes edible
you really think grimace would stand a chance against goliath
on i mean i know he's only just established but grimace is only so
strong
maulicles dogs edible because he wants to eat out rags like the massive he is
oh my goodness mmm good boy i'm just saying
you can eat a dog that's all i mean by edible you don't have to take it to that
direction i don't know also hi jay jay isn't here i'm so sorry
uh from blessed south will please make aid in the new third host
i'm afraid she probably has a life so becoming a full host of efap would
kind of destroy that in every way shape and form
you know people joke about becoming a 24-hour there'll be a point where
efap episodes will just bleed into each other like me and rags finish an episode
and we're like right see you in an hour when we start the next one
all the time at least we get to sleep for that hour
you see how sleepy i get just after fucking playing dnd
i get too tired god damn it yeah it's it's it's tough we we we're still
going and still nailing it it's fine we're still awake that's the point it's
all good it's fine uh why is bulbasaur objectively the best
starter he's not charmander charmander one knows that
bulbasaur is still a fair choice bulbasaur i wouldn't deny that
well he's gonna say i think he i think bulbasaur is like he's got like the best
stats and yes and gets you past when it comes to
coolness obviously charming yeah coolness factor that's kind of where
we're going from i still you know i'm saying this i'm being
very objective my pick is squiddle i know that i don't care that it's not the
thing that people go for but i go for squiddle
and i see i mean he does get sunglasses
yeah oh they oh also uh bulbasaur evolves quicker than the other two
but he's a plant and nobody likes vegetables dude
that man that's not really much of an argument to be had there though
like it's like fire cool water yeah that's pretty cool vegetables
i mean that's all right again yeah it's a vegetable and no offense to
venusaur but he looks retarded can we all agree on that he's like
while blastoise like first of all fucking badass name and he's a turtle
with like these explosive fucking tank things on his
backs like oh that's cool charizard is a dragon that has fire
all over it's like oh so cool yeah venusaur is this like old man
who's like struggling to walk like i'm plant
he's like oh no so sometimes you got to consider
the end evolutions when considering which also
oh yeah bulbasaur is a mutant of poison yeah razor leaf yeah once you get to
venusaur that always criticals okay uh so it's good again he's getting
against rock he's really good against water
uh cozy against fire remind me fire how you don't fight fire very often
no no does it matter how often versus whether or not you can progress
well yeah you can your bully yeah absolutely there's you don't fight that
many fire types so if you're going to if you want the
chance you want to be able to be good against
you know rock and water and other grass types and i think you'll be going to
get sorry type two also venusaur is very thick but you get
like what solar beam yeah uh stuff like that i mean he has to
charge solar beam which is pretty shit you gotta admit
i don't know i just again venusaur is immune to sleep and poison
well there you go yeah that's he's immune to sleep good job
you should be a host and also since since he's good against water
and um rock that means that the first two gyms you go to are
brock and misty in their effectively squiddle still fares very well against
them he destroys rock and he's he's 50 50 with water
so that's worse yeah but no you're right but when you you're you're taking a
sample size of just the first two gym leaders
i think charizard fit yeah those will be the those will be the more those will
just be the two difficult ones the rest will be no problem because by then
you'll have a lot of other poke i feel like most pokemon fans will
take issue with that statement right rag is
i mean if you don't take i mean if you take like charmander
he's not going to be doing anything to brock so your best what what what
a lot of people like what i did was i was tackle you could still use tackle
yeah what i would do is i would use now that but it because in
gen one i believe tackle is a normal type move which means it's not going to
do shit to rock no it's so what you're going to do is
you're going to want to get yourself a caterpillar and then once he becomes a
butterfree you learn confusion which is a psychic type which is going to
which is going to really hurt him rags this is bullshit what you're talking
about it's just bullshit that's not sure i
disagree i i just think that i i've never had a
huge amount of problems with that and i've always that's because that's
because the games are kind of easy they are well they are easy you're not
wrong yeah that's true yeah it's gonna you're gonna
have to you have to put self-imposed challenges if you're gonna actually be
challenged by the pokemon games i i don't actually really like them
anymore i i think the combat gameplay is too simplistic and repetitive
objectively wrong to pick bulbosaur we've established this okay
now he's he's the thickest yeah but he's it's still morally wrong to pick him
he's a plant let him sit in the soil let him be a plant
i'm not hearing any counter arguments so i think that's that's it we agree good
stuff oh yeah yeah i'm glad
uh more let's say rhino fist like you're yelling
rhino fist is that good enough
i'm not hearing any objections once again that is pretty good pretty good
that's right oh no is that what happened to wolf you ate him
wolf isn't a doggo he's a wolfo different thing
so if i say yes it's not connected whatsoever willy wonka did the wang
doodle genocide oh
oh no uh the lumpers were from loompa land because
roll dahl did not get to call them n-words oh
is this confirmed in in the epilogue from lord roll dahl
uh ephar every frame a racist oh
oh shakespeare is best in the original klingon
yep shakespeare klingon i didn't know that it's an
it's a star trek inside joke it's a reference to the undiscovered country
ifap is the borg of lore and memes i don't disagree with that absorb
confirm we kill i mean in a good way this stream has confirmed that literally
anything is more interesting than one of quinton's videos he is more of a massive
massive than film robert oh is he more of a massive massive than film robert
he's a massive massive dude
still who'd you rather cover film robert or quinton rags what would you
reckon
film robert you'd rather cover film robert
quinton's funny because of his patheticness yeah i
yeah but uh film robert does really test your limits in in the brain yeah i
guess so yeah i guess i guess quit i don't know they're both
shit yes yes agreed uh it's tough it's weird like i i would
just alternate one to the other honestly hmm
yeah i think maybe when you've watched one of them the other one seems tempting
and vice versa and yeah maybe that was not so bad when
you think of that one you know but that was not so bad when you think of that
one you know it's this whole thing it's
complicated i understand i love fin speedo was melting from the heat and
pressure of the laser but fin in his exposed cockpit remained safe and sound
nice fine i mean everybody knows that flesh
burns at a higher degree than mel does right
true right yeah my goodness for a second there i thought it was i was like oh no
my point uh benjamin cisco is best captain
don't at me um okay i will at you i will say that in terms of best
overall captain cisco and picard are really fighting it out
in terms just to the strategic stuff in terms of
best captain from an entertaining point of view
oh you got to make jane way and cap kirk fight each other
because they don't give a shit about the rules that's what makes them
interesting well what about captain uh
orlok is that his name the guy from discovery
who cares that's that's the point i'm bringing it up because i know that no
one cares is it all wrong am i right on that or
something else maybe just discuss it i don't care at all
quick play rag's theme rag's thing i think you mean acaba's theme uh the
theory that han solo activated the lightsaber was debunked on the
novelization
i don't know i'm holding out um yeah yeah yeah that that he was able to turn
on when you're talking about when he cuts up the taunt on
what did the novelization say um the luke did it basically that like you
yeah there needs to be like extant energy in there
okay all right no don't believe it okay i mean that that either way now in the
universe that's been overridden by fin so i don't know couldn't someone just
overwrite that again with a novel like oh fin did it because it's ray was
turns out he actually was a little far sensitive just enough
look i i'm i'm definitely in the camp that a lightsaber can be activated by
just a random dude you flick a switch it turns on it's a piece of machinery and
i kind of like the idea that a randy can pick it up and be like i don't want to
try and use this oh god i'm terrible with it because jedi have like a benefit
being that they're full sensitive they can use it better but
i guess not like you can't use it just press a button god damn it
just press the goddamn button you'll be you'll be better off than not at all
yeah it's like i can believe building it would be you know a jedi thing but yeah
broke han killed himself for kylo woke force ghost han turned on the lightsaber
and killed snoke do it jj i'm not against it i want to see it now
it's like a whole set of seeds to recontextualize it like how terrible but you say that but like
don't you want it i want it bake it be as bad as possible only only for a meme but oh yeah
totally but do you expect episode nine to be great on its own like seriously no no you know
what i guess you know what let's let's hope it's as bad as possible because at least that would
be funny to be honest yeah i'm like let's go even worse let's go even worse whatever we can do to
make that worse do it let's go to the next super chat yes because i'm fucking tired of shit um
i'm yeah trying not to pass out again how many naps do you need woman i i mean a lot of listen
i sit around and read thousands of pages of research every god damn day wait until if have
to fall asleep yeah we noticed look he's not he's not happy with you aden look at his look at his
dog sign see that dog eater dog eater i'm being dog-eared and rags don't lie he's
putting up his grievances that's what that is right there i have a right to protest in this
podcast that's true uh so why didn't ob1's force ghost just go and kill the emperor and hit the
self-destruct button on the death star yeah why not you can react with the material world yeah i mean
i won't go as far as saying hit the self-destruct button but i'm sure there was an equivalent of
such a thing strike a lightning shot into like the most important part of it and that's yeah you
could have done that but he didn't you know why because ob1 is a cowardly idiot that's what the
sequel trilogy tells us don't even try to deny it don't even try no it's accurate um
um i sent a pic of efap with pregnant shrek because she wants she watches efap and she
asked me what's going on i told her i honestly don't know also say hi to sierra hello sierra
hello hello hello hashtag maiden hashtag maiden m-a-y-d-i-n hashtag maiden is official efap cannon
don't know what that m-a-y-d-e-n m-a-y-d-i-d-i-n yeah oh yeah i can't stand the other kind
maiden raggled drink a beer with with your bum oh okay no it's going in the uh going on the other
end going in the front entrance not the back i think that's fair i just gotta get myself a
what are you against this rags really yes i'm against this first off waste of a good beer
second off i mean that it's gotta come back out yeah eventually some way
horrifying you and rags restore my faith in critical thinking also yes to universal language
yeah like i said there's loads of hiccups to how you'd actually implement or even change
anything to do that way that i obviously wouldn't be on board with i'm just saying it would be a
pretty neat experiment just to see how everything goes if the whole world spoke one language and
always did and always will like see how see how things change i'd be interested to see what happens
if anything changes perhaps everything is just as it is who knows uh love you guys greater than
three less than i think it's supposed to be a happy kiss face some kind i approve
i approve universal language equals cringy rage comic memes
yeah maybe i said i don't have a small price to pay i don't have any suggestions on implementation
nor would i want to because holy shit like many pipe dreams it's a pipe dream uh more confirmed
to be skull face from mgs5 i have not played it what yeah it's pretty good yeah it's it's good
i'd definitely recommend it it's fun i liked it how about we just understood finish game but
still great so uh how about we just understood every language so we can speak to each other in
our native languages and still understand each other hey man i'm on board with that too if we
all if we got to pipe dream it into succession that all of us understood all languages that'll
be cool too though i still think that there would be a level of like you gotta you gotta make sure
you're using the right inflections with the right language this is a lot of complications but yeah
if we can nail it all perfectly sure um now i really want alex jones to guest on efap so you
can call mauler a filthy globalist i would totally i would not only would i ask him what's wrong with
my plan but once he explains it i'd probably be like alex you've educated me so fucking
please come back on here uh mauler teach sign language as a global secondary language
sign isn't just translating other language it's its own thing keep cultural languages
i mean yeah that could be pretty cool sign language i get everyone new sign language that
could be pretty interesting see what happens with that too i want to run all kinds of unethical
experiments where we take like a group of 100 children and give them their own planet and watch
them create their own culture when i love unethical experiments oh yeah but then people
like you can't do that let's fuck that but i'll be like yeah i know but it would be pretty cool
yeah put the toys away and be like dang it all right i would love to see all those sjws be forced
to use language with gendered verbs slash nouns slash adjectives like polish it would be hilarious
yeah i remember um when we were learning french but they were like you gotta gotta make sure using
the male versus female like like elements of whatever and i remember being like oh man this
this sounds complicated now you're just like wow how would that work for people who think that's
offensive what do you do then fucked bro no idea efap scares off their second female guest not good
see this is referring to when you first went to sleep this isn't even when i'm talking about second
time what makes good rat i don't know sounds like some fairy shit though also hi rags hello
buy some rhino milk one question i've listened to all of the efaps but i think i'm missing the
origin of tism where did that come from uh i don't know if it's all this time well i know where it
came from because i was using it as long as there have been men there have been men with tism i've
been using it on you folks since i got here but uh i got it from drunken peasants and specifically
tj they're talking about um i can't remember what episode it was but um i think it's about
ted cruz he's making a public statement about mental health and um they're making jokes about how
he's got this like super southern accent he's like damn their kids got the tism this is like
i was like oh my goodness that's so funny to refer to it that way and um they started using
it regularly and that's i started using it regularly with my friends and it's sort of
a funny word that's all and then i started using it all the time when i was with wolf and rags and
that's at least my contribution i know wolf watched drunken peasants separately to me so
there's a good chance that he had it separately to me as a usage of word i rags do you have do
you know anything about your use of it beyond me and wolf oh i think i think this has just
accelerated my usage there you go yeah it's it's a natural thing it's a beautiful word
uh typical i'm at disney will on my beautiful on my last vacation day i see efap is on i leave
disney will get on a plane i just barely landed and efap is still going never changed long man
never changed oh man that's fucked up oh my god it looks like he had a full day of fun and then
he had some efap to come back to you that's that's it's great jesus who he had a full day of fun and
what did we fucking have we talked about when he views his views on tlj that's something
something what's something um it would be come to the store with rags mauler and me
i guess that was in reference to what jay was talking about
yes are we right i i just i i've forgotten exactly the context next one says i loathed math
hey i i liked math until it got too non-math i yeah i had terrible table math i had terrible
math classes until i got to graduate school though so uh i would always say like you gotta
find a good math teacher you know someone who wants you to actually learn and doesn't
just want to be a dick i'd say that's fine um snot come in his nose haven't heard mauler laugh
this much since patrick said the alien tip monster was his favorite addition to star wars saga
see that was ages ago though like me laughing and stuff so that was a long time ago so long ago
was getting on the pirates the caribbean ride when i saw efap live then i went on my last ride
at the park left disney world got my bags got to the hotel got on my bus went to the airport just
landed now and efap is still going well i mean you know it makes sense we've we've we've now been
going for five hours plus 11 16 hours makes sense hello mauler rags and genders genders
yeah okay i recommended superman kingdom come he's practically luke in tlj except he rises to
the challenge and gets the fuck off the island there's a motion comic on youtube and yes you do
get to look at women kingdom comes a great comic yep wait are you telling me that he doesn't want
to kill himself on the island he doesn't achieve this this goal how would superman come in
kryptonite grapes flying to the sun you would eat the kryptonite grapes
kryptonite grapes oh that's how you do it
um it's a really well shot movie written by an eight-year-old i think that's referencing klj
schadenfreude is from german and it's better understood in other languages because it gives
the others a word to describe a concept where there was none before
schadenfreude yeah sure enough doesn't that doesn't like another word for like just
everything's falling apart like cataclysm or catastrophe a little bit but it does have to
do specifically with um enjoyment of the suffering of others uh does the slab outlive the skin flap
or jack um yeah i don't know how long the slab lives for it seems to be infinite i really don't
know if the slab gets broken does she feel pain what have you broke the slab in half what's on the
other side i'm picturing you slap it in half and there's just this fleshy like disgusting
shit coming out of the center and she's screaming and you're like oh god how can i make it stop and
you keep hitting it to make it stop keep i'm sorry i never thought about this but it's kind
of confirmed that they have oral sex yeah so like you know how thick a slab of concrete is
it's not really all that thick so when he sticks his dick in like where does it go down
that marinade there for a bit hmm okay okay
it does what like it does you you you get an inch in and then it does a 90
yeah it can feel weird but it works anything for love right anything the doctor has committed
genocide many times yeah i believe so the Daleks being one of them right but they were bad
since when has mauler since when has mauler arachnophobia i was promised a woman
and her beautiful voice could you please move up anna please moreover high rags hello
we have for male we did it this is the second one person how could you say it
yoda versus sheave is bad skip to obi versus doth vader
i don't know i like the yoda versus palpatine fight it's kind of neat maybe i'm wrong i need
to see it again uh martial arts involve feints obi and anakin duel again uh if if someone like
shad could explain some of those moves as feints and then i'd probably ask him
the practicality and actual like execution of those would be it could be very interesting
well a faint is like well he is pretending to make a convincing blow that doesn't yet you don't
actually follow through with so yeah you get people to move their weapon to block a blow that
they anticipate but actually you go somewhere else with it you know that's pretty useful very
useful and more at how certainly hi rags hello been a long time fan i wanted to show a little
monetary support enough also mauler please give this five to rags will do also finish your tfa
critique i'm gay this is gonna happen seriously the next question is about that too these are
two different accounts how did they say the same thing at the same time how does that happen
this bullshit when will we get tfa part three before episode nine comes out
that's the intention i cannot necessarily say that that is the the the thing that will happen
i'm i'm not 100 sure uh the only example of a lightsaber having some real weight
in the sequel trilogy is every time fin wields one i mean
i don't really felt you know weight the way the sequel trilogy honestly i just kind of see it as
yes it's got his lightsaber out he's doing his thing quinton tlj connects all of the movies
also quinton they're only sequels if you interpret them that way the sequel trilogy is heavily
standalone it's a very confusing mess and it's the kind of thing that i'd probably ask him about if
he was ever to come on the show but i mean the likelihoods of that you roll the dice and you have
to roll a double seven the likelihood of him coming it's gonna be tough i just talk about
b 111 that's eight videos always on efap we can't talk only about stuff was that that would never
work even me and rags and i would be become bored that's the practice grammar right all right
i can't even barely what i think he agreed with that tonal loki being choked by quinn
thanos you'll never be a god no that means that locust to die to quinton oh that that would make
sense yeah it's shit don't have that um salutations moussellini jar jar and ragu
long time watcher first time shackle dispenser say hello to wharf for me too also ripping
pepperoni's aiden paladin well she's back hello wharf and riparoni paladoni oh
please get the archive of this one up fast i need my fix hi jay hi rags hi random person
with a drink i don't know yet hello hello yes the other one will go up as soon as this one is
finished i will sort that out as soon as i can mauler jay what are wales and scotland's chances
in the rugby world cup this year jay wouldn't be able to answer that and i would probably not be
able to answer that either i'd have to go and ask my dad he's very into it i would give him i would
allow him to have a full description of exactly what the chances are um over with y'all quinton
likes tlj because he saw it three times and wasn't bored
yeah good enough reason to like anything am i right mules lee voice hello lady and gentleman
would it be one lady oh i guess because the episode in which there was one lady i i follow
there's a bit of brain dying elements to this right episode nine plot they all go for schwarmer
with the current mcu and discuss the awful prospects followed by coffee with batman and
superman also hi rags hello if jar jar is in episode nine i want him to kill elper emperor palpatine
i'm not against it if you're gonna bring back palpatine have him be killed by jar jar i think
that's fair in terms of requests jar jar needs his moment to shine yeah like a hero moment i think we
i feel defeating the ghost of the evil evil emperor palpatine is the perfect way to do that
how long will episode nine's crawl be i don't know it's like holy fucking shit guys strap in
it just begins with okay so there's a few things we need to go over that's what that's what it says
this is weird this has been distracting so you're probably wondering how i got
look i still think that the best vision is going to be the one where they just sit down on a sofa
they're like we need to speak one to one honestly for introducing us to the horridness
hi rags hello any interest in reviewing code vein
i haven't played it but it's kind of on my maybe list so potentially
is naming a porg han worse than no one remembers what a y-wing is
yeah no i think it's more fucked up for han to name a porg it's for chewy to name a porg han
than it is for just right to say no one remembers what a y-wing is just right yeah but one of those
is just blatantly false true the other one is the other one we could write it off as just
writing a taste on a potential but the other one is in the film that happens at that point
you know i mean that's actually i get it if it happened and it was real well do you mean
it happened the porg name happens in the film versus just right says people don't remember
y-wings i i mean because i've read out what it says in that case it would be worse right
well someone in chat said did aidan fall a seat for the fourth time it would be the third time
the fourth time i'm all good i'm all good i can't have them lying about saying you fall and
see for the fourth that's unacceptable it's the third time you got that right star wars explained
hit list club um yeah i'm assuming you guys may may or not be aware aware of this but jeremy
pissed off star was explained enough that star was explained blocked anybody connected to him
and then it blocked like half of his own audience by accident it's like so many people were following
so many people who were following jeremy in different ways and like even like i got blocked
and i was like i don't even know who this person is it was it was embarrassing but i'm sure he feels
great and that's an important thing at molly you're reading superchats from an eight hours ago
that's your opinion his porg named han me execute order 66 they said that that's directed at ra
we shouldn't give him that kind of power um it would make my name for each of you to say
my name in the most sensual way possible and the person's name is burnt sausage
burnt sausage
right
i'm not the burnt sausage that you are looking for my sausage is not burnt it is
like like a pale it doesn't get much sun you know so you'd say it's like a mildly
old like a like a lukewarm sausage almost no no it is hot as fuck but not burnt but not burnt
burnt sausage is the sensual way of saying it whether or not it is a burnt sausage that's the
case so you could call something that whether or not it is that you know you can mislabel things
it's okay what if instead of them saying that the kamikaze was their favorite thing they quoted
patrick willams and said luke's space cow was their favorite thing that would kind of be better
because we wouldn't have to be sitting here wondering why the hell they thought that was
in canon to have ship hyperspace into a bunch of other ships and destroys everything and wins the
battle like that's not compared to luke drinking milk you know damage wise there's a difference
i would have preferred uh drunk efap is apex efap also hi hasim
no reaction from right so i thought you'd like that well i'm not i'm not he's hasim is a character
yeah i'm not really hasim but hasim is voiced by you give him life would be up to you
i i don't think that it's time hasim he just he there needs to be something that really gets
him to emerge you know you can't just trot out hasim whenever we feel like it
it seems not your play thing i get it you know hodor was a better hero than holdo hashtag not my
r with resistance colon hail hydra are you trying to say the resistance are actually the badminton's
because i don't uh drunk mauler is the funniest more drunk streams yeah but if they run
for like 17 hours drunkenness really just comes and goes you sober up before the stream's even
over which is kind of where i'm at almost not really because i'm still dropping things uh would
it have been cleverer or clever is is if instead of bbh shooting the coins out like afk'ing roger
rabbit gag he presented them to the code breaker as a pymt oh payment i mean kind of but you'd
think that the the code breaker would find a way to be able to do something like that on his own
like you wouldn't need a robot but maybe uh pablo is aragorn's useless horse execute order 66
aragorn didn't have a useless horse it saved him he was in the river it's a good horse
fun fact pablo hidalga's balls are in kathleen kennedy's purse i didn't know that
uh hux is alfarias hydra dominatus for the emperor
my reference to 40k i'm thinking so i'm gonna assume so
i know i always hated luke because of his dad
yeah it happens it's not like a complete recontextualization it happens oh my god she's
alive time to guest him mom too now we've reached the super chat scene where she woke up for the
first time we're getting there you see full progress you know hyperspace ramming is explained
by han solo in episode four as the falcon is being chased by the star destroyer other than
that keep up the great content yeah he says that if you don't plan out um the coordinates you can
end up crashing into something which isn't exactly the same as obliterating an entire army
and hence why we don't necessarily think it follows that you can obliterate an entire fleet
with one ship so a lot of people are just sitting there thinking wait that's a thing so how come
they didn't do that before and then you have people being like well of course because holder
didn't think of it and then you have the double counter but han talked about in episode four is
a thing that's possible it's just like you've got two people who agree it's possible but have
different reasons that conflict with each other that's when it gets all very complicated doesn't
it um aden is best guest other than special guest rags please come on more often also high rags
hello aden's probably got more time per a single episode than pretty much any of our guests have
even though some of it went sleeping was asleep it still still counts possibly i don't actually
know it's late outside now oh god it's been late aside for me for a while oh yeah it's starting
to get light outside for me as well hey guys thanks for all the great faps and other content
you make you've inspired me to start making my own videos excellent you do you sir least favorite
to favorite dceu films justice league suicide squad jazam wonder woman man of steel bvs ultimate
edition and aquaman fair enough i kind of think they all suck outside of wonder woman having a
special mention of not sucking as much as the right i haven't did jazam but i i decided to be
okay other than that i don't know i was told to expect it to be good i watched it with a friend
of mine and we thought it was terrible so i why i have no i have no faith in dc whatsoever so
it's really like whatever but oh god i just think i don't know i went to go see
man of steel all hype because i love superman as a as a character concept
and i was like i don't like zach snyder very much but i maybe this will be okay
and then i was sad yeah three hours they've all been you've joined a group of people who are sad
it's okay it happens with a lot of media if not old media at this point god it was the worst
i think that was my first time because i was like i was still like 23 you're 22
i'm so young relatively things didn't suck as much
aiden force projects into efap reality passed out
there's lots of interpretations watch the long long man vids it's a japanese
candy because it's one of those only points of long man good some people reference this
like the long man gum whatever it is from like japanese ads it's like i reference one of them
in tfa part two it was from a video that i want to say e-man gameplay made i think he did
don't be wrong i'm pretty sure he did uh bring metaka as a guest along with more er
i i've got no contact with mr metaka but i also doubt you'd want to actually guest on this because
i don't know what he's up to in his day-to-day uh it's never too long mauler you know i stayed up
the entire 50th special and still went to work you know i'll do it again i have no life oh
i mean this one's not going to be a 50th level 24 hour thing it'll be fine i'm going to get to
the end of this before we hit that 100 i'm from wales mauler confirming he does indeed have sex
with sheep 2019 i think you gotta do it but you're actually from well i'm just i what do
we call it um i am a uh so like in america we call people who who are who are americans who pretend
to be irish on like st fadrick's day we call them plastic patties i figured what mine was was mine a
um what kind of sheep i don't remember plastic sheep no something like this though um
silicon sheep is that it i don't know i've not heard of it but that sounds like it could be it
uh we made it up so i'm not sure very sad that aden does not snore could have been an epic stream
yeah sorry she didn't make enough noises sorry about that i wasn't very epic sorry guys
epic ekistan has the best flag ekistan doesn't be out wales that's bullshit sorry no wales
definitely still has the best flag yeah they should have made their flag based after wales
with cax that's the way to do it to do have done it there you go that's english to do that well
the next one says also i better go to part two to this i'm praying we are five and a half hours
into part two so yes there is definitely a part two uh rabbits are based and bunny pilled
best pets i've known people with bunny pets i've never had a bunny pet myself
any of you guys have experience with bunny pets i don't know anything yeah yeah i don't know
anything about uh them there and then they're rabbits why such a short efap gay yoda with aids
that's apparently a quote from gay yoda with aids i didn't know yeah no sorry we've been doing some
short efaps lately i will admit we fucked up on that degree but we're gonna do some long ones at
some point we will oh please uh her screaming forgive me ruined the show
do they mean about aden did you say that at some point or so else what did i scream forgive me i
don't know i don't know what they might be referencing something we were watching i don't
know buffet or i don't remember doing that unless i did it in my sleep oh goodness i'm trying to
think of who may have screamed forgive me and all of buffy i'm not oh they probably referencing
season six why would that ruin the show i'd have to wait when she's talking to tara about whether
or not oh oh oh yeah yeah um hmm she doesn't say forgive me she says don't forgive me the point is
yeah yeah i don't know i like that scene myself but hey i like how much all of season six and
season five actually so whatever season six and five pretty damn good uh hey becca how is nathan
oh it might be from my son
my name is becca i'm pretty sure that's my my son uh nathan's my adopted alaskan child okay
i don't know you just sit there on the internet and you find someone from the alaskan wilderness
who's you know like an 18 year old kid and you go let me show you how to play dota my child
and then that's then you hang out for the next 10 years
well uh thank you rags you man of culture the isle of man has the best flag screw y'all
okay in honor of ra i believe after the fight they threw the white dragon off the roof
yes the wales would have done that because they'd be like i was as objectively the better dragon
exactly i said rags would love that flag very manly the three legs yeah sure i don't disagree
yeah that's what you call a pretty good flag wales was conquered and incorporated into the kingdom
of england but the welsh can fib about dragons so i guess wales wins in the end yes exactly
that's what's important that's what's important it's just a cheap swastika
this flag was the origin of the fidget spinner
this flag equals mauler's ocean man i mean i laughed at ocean man as well uh what have we done
we've humanized mauler he has emotion dear god have mercy who needs a wheel when you have three
legs yeah i don't disagree push tri-leg over starts beyblading i feel like it would struggle to
get any kind of traction but maybe the leg swastika of the boreal valley yeah i know that reference
doxels three reference fucking i'm up on my shit i know what's going on uh scissorly flag look it up
did we look at the scissorly flag yeah we did okay
he's smaller the average efap gets longer and longer as time goes on next year y'all need
20 hours to go over a two minute video in superchats yeah that sounds like it could be possible you
never know shad draw the isle of man flag giving birth oh no i guess that's yeah that's a reference
to shad the other shad not let shad this come on here shad new idea for fantasy re-armed the tri-leg
yeah i wouldn't mind seeing a video from shadow bursty exploring the validity of a tri-leg weapon
you know no i'm just here to give you some money though the isle of man flag bit with some primo rat
yeah it was some good rat i can agree three legs is a celtic symbol for the sun
i didn't know that why couldn't they just have two yeah obviously well it makes sense because
when you look at the sun i don't know it's you but i think man that's like three legs
that's really what i see at least three like i don't know see i'm weird i see it as sort of
like a bull or or a sick great glowing spleen in the sky it's different yeah i guess we all see
something different in the sun i'm okay with this it happens uh rags pork blast my butt until my
ars hole whistles mmm boy rags get your flow in there doesn't worry rags what are your thoughts
on the ranger class in dnd i haven't played it enough to tell but it's a it seems to be so far
from what i did play a really good rank because i played a a spellless ranger for the campaign
that we did but what what what was it though was it a dnd this is dnd fifth edition the one i played
okay never mind i was gonna just kind of range damage dealer uh pretty simple and straightforward
it had a little bit of healing for mostly after combat stuff but it could put out some serious
damage at range really good survival checks and perception and um you know things like that that
could help and keeping food and stuff you got a lot of good bonuses for crossing terrain but
i gotta tell you combat goes great damage at range i gotta tell you something real quick
i've had a little bit to drink but i'm gonna be honest with you my dude um i think you almost
killed doom uh like just because you were asking him questions that he had no capacity to answer
the other day uh well only because because it's like because bill wasn't dm'ing anymore
and i think you almost killed doom is that a constant thing that's gonna happen like is is
bill gonna how long is um i i don't know i don't know how long uh because because doom has his own
story he wants to tell so it'll be when you know doom well it should be the story that's unfolded
by what the players do ideally right yes one would assume doom was was wanted to run the
rhodesia campaign sorry everyone who's listening we are i'm briefly talking about the fact that
again we play pat pointer every week it's what it's one of the well one of the issues was like
we really hurried up like a bunch of the court stuff and like that we just got it down and swept
it under the rug and i'm like oh i thought there'd be like implications to this probably should have
been more in in large part that's a problem because you know then naka and bill came here
to the u.s for like three weeks yeah and that made shit all fucked up and now i'm going there
yeah because i like i was taking notes on like things that i should do that i'd been told i could
do like go to the go to this place for this thing i was like okay that's on my little list of things
to do is like you have to go get this pick that up it's being appraised it's like okay go pick this
up and i have all this stuff listed out i i actually spend a fair amount of time because i use um
uh wps office for my little things and so i have like a pretty fucking baller sheet that's got all
my attack info and i'm i'm not very knowledgeable about a lot of this so i've got all the the
calculations for like attacking and damaging and the smiting evil and things like that i got all
this stuff listed with all a bunch of links it's actually quite impressive and i'm proud of it
and i'm like man i didn't get to use like any of these notes that i've been taking because we're
just like nope you're going here in the morning okay i get i i get that but it's like there's
nothing we could do about it because i guess not because they were just like you know you're just
going i'm like well no because because we well we did tell you the week before that it was doom is
gonna take over that bill wasn't gonna be dm'ing and there's like even so like for me like i was
trying to open my chakras and and doom doesn't know about that so like without bill there i can't
really do that stuff and and he's trying to not dm because he never gets to not dm so
i mean i dm'ing would be something i'd be interested in doing
systems quite at the moment ask bill about it he'll he loves teaching people how to do that
i might actually do that i might be interested in um dm'ing a dnd pathfinder kind of game
i feel like all the video games efap kind of stuff that i've done can really help with a
lot of that but still like whenever i make an attack like i have to be like okay i think
this 1d20 plus my mab masterwork so add a plus one and then i think about the bonuses i have
you know i i kind of gotta go through it and things like that but that'd be something i'd
be interested in doing but i think i'm like we gotta cap it at like four people oh yeah
yeah but uh yeah if you have any questions about that just uh ask bill
i i will seriously consider that that might be something i uh
are accusing me of falling asleep or forgetting things i'm like i'm letting them talk are you
oh yeah we got distracted oh you got no it's not your get that's chat let people discuss
that i'm not supposed to just be like no guys stop i don't care if you wanted to say stuff
to be fair we're talking about completely i'm okay with that because i've made you suffer
through hours of everything else like quinton like did you did you sign up for this no maybe
but no i mean kind of i mean i signed up for life we didn't really sign up for it uh anyway
i'm going to grab myself a drink i'll be right back go for it uh what a show you massive so
much new lore uh i don't even 100 remember all of the lore but yes you guys i'm still
watching part three episode 50 i don't know if i'll ever catch up keep it up hi rags also j
yo all you've ruined your notes for gedelb no no i don't know i'll make they'll make sense to me
don't worry it looks like mauler has a crush boys and girls we can only hope for more links
hi uh the biting elbows bad motherfucker music video is the proof of concept for hardcore henry
give that a watch it's on youtube no you'll find the proof of proof of concept for hardcore
henry was in doom isn't that right rags oh that was quite that was quite the segment and it was
honestly a terrible one i don't know there's something i liked it but it was we laughed at
it yeah mauler we laughed at it we made fun of it and it tried to be serious and what did we do
the one where he laughs at it he shoots the zombie's axe and it fucking slams into the
act of the head of the zombie and it's like what how does that but there's a lot of that it's
funny though the zombie's laughing at him as he turns the corner or whatever yeah there's okay
yeah i agree look up zelagorsk flag and kingdom of kulmeria we have to look at flags zelagorsk is a
zelagorsk is a city in dayz what's that zelagorsk flag i'm clicking wow is what google's being
weird it shows new results wow that is that is actually fucking amazing i'm gonna here uh look
at this this flag is actually really sweet all right give me this is a ball and ass flag
it's a bear splitting an atom oh
that is super cool hey the soviets didn't fuck something up
guys we got a flag it's an attack it's uh apparently it's the atomic testing
town of zelagorsk russia that's cool i like it that bear i like that's not taking any
restrictions he's like no i'm doing this happening that bear is splitting an atom
now we gotta show the chat if you haven't but it's really they can say it it's fucking sweet man
that's a cool flag it's way better than the three legs bullshit how can you say that you're supposed
to be pro three legs uh been out of the loop for a bit more what was your thoughts i'm far from home
i'm not crazy for thinking it was terribly written right well i don't want to say too much because
i'm actually wanting to watch it with rag soon but um i'll tell you this much fringy
loves it i think it's good it but it's got this what which movie far from home it's the second
spooderman i love it oh i haven't seen it so uh i bet you were saying about something else
but i would never go as far as saying it's terribly written now so uh we did have a we'd
have an efap on it uh rags was not present obviously um but we talked to shad about the
plot of far from home in an efap uh you can go check that out with that's got fringy me and shad and
is it jay i can't remember who else is in that efap um it feels bad man um it was a while ago i
can't remember all of the efaps um mauler and aden sitting in a tree k i s s i n g i'm assuming this
is because of the fact that we both like buffy that's entirely what it's based on i swear to god
they i just i don't meet many people who like buffy that's all that is uh darkness fools
could have been good but they ruined it in the first scene by showing them they don't show the
monster you see the creature's outward appearance if you will but you don't see what it looks like
until the end for realsies that's what makes good horror though yeah and i don't know don't show
don't tell that's my opinion they don't show a lot of hair um in the opening scene but you
definitely get enough i don't know i think it works really well but to be displayed eventually
i i'll make i'll make rags watch it mj and wolf and we'll talk about how terrible slash good
mauler i'm so tired i know you can go to sleep rags i don't it's okay it wouldn't be the same
you you you haven't you haven't slept now for uh i mean it would be different like i'd be asleep
obviously different you haven't been asleep for like 17 hours rags i haven't been asleep
for a long time long man time long man time and again this will help me get this will help me
catch up on the sleep that i definitely don't need to catch up on it's like oh boy even more
sleep hooray super chat just says no you are gay what day is today yes Monday fuck no it's monday
yeah it is monday right there oh my god um that was the greatest plot summary read by welsh
that was oppressive you did a very good job mauler add this to the 25 i gave you this morning buy
avatar last airbender on blu-ray promise don't buy more wine with it don't drink wine i don't
are you a wineman i'm a spiritsman yeah i'm like i'm here for wine myself the most part
if i do drink wine always white don't really care for were the reds i mean you don't care for
oh so you prefer the whites i see well you prefer the whites bias confirmed i was gonna say it's
nice to finally get it out in the open i will admit a chilly white uh and then it ends with
saying good morning aden good morning yeah it's morning for you folks now it's the afternoon for
me this is getting a little intense isn't it it's well it's what it's one o'clock it's six hours
until i go is this six hours until i've been up for 24 hours what the fuck
but it did uh subnautica scared me more than anything else i haven't played it but i've heard
that it's it can be creepy i've heard this terror is a long building feeling horror is shock
i don't know where this has come from but i'd be willing to accept those as technicians i don't
know i don't have to look into it i'm because i love horror and i think that to be truly um
terrified and i mean like do you see that horror is shock and terror is a long building feeling
i i i don't know if the the the linguistic uh delineation is accurate but there is a difference
between like being startled which is yeah that's a cognitive heuristic your brain can't help but
be startled like if i mean you know yeah that's why jump scares are shit and i if they happen to
me i'm like oh that's lazy and i don't like it i don't hate old jump scares then all yeah some
jump scares are hurt but man they're they can be cheap as shit and when they happen i like uh i
kind of check out and i roll my eyes because like yeah good job you surprised my brain yeah you
worked really hard on that good job but terror i love terror i don't really i don't really like horror
but i love me some terror i yeah i like that i again like i said like the i don't know if i'm
comfortable with those definitions i i like long slow burning horror in that uh but i mean i i
think i love yeah i'm done with that the void is great i fantastic film love it i'm big on
atmosphere you know but i because i again i would recommend she'd actually told you films
of being like a movie that's done cinema verite or um i don't know if you want to call it cinema
verite whatever but it's three hours long and quote nothing happens in it but it's just the
i'm pro-terrorism yeah so so oppressive it's great it's it's honestly it's a whole conversation
that we are not in the position to be we can have next fucking no when we can yeah sorry thank
you oh god it'll be this week won't it oh yeah it'll be this week it'll be this week now oh
thanks all you lads for all the great content i credit efap for helping me develop my taste and
understand objectivity this episode is the one year anniversary of me watching one year of efap
wow you remembered that which is weird strange but i'll take yeah cool i'll take it heart that's
great we're glad to have you for a year odd that you remembered that um is face tile agenda
pansexual lando like
face tile genders that's a whole field that i'm not familiar with
aden you might know about face tile genders what what's the deal
what face tile genders i have no idea uh she'll i'm sure she'll read some psycho paper about her
whatever psycho paper psycho paper only fucking sleepy dog right now yeah i could i could agree
with the sleepy dog i actually don't know what it is but i can i mean the the doctor who's a person
in the aisle doctor who was she was she asleep for that stretch she wasn't oh shit were you no
she was talking she was there for the absorber off you were there for the absorber off right
no i think i might fall asleep she was here only in technicality she was not here in acidity
well you remember the episode with the absorber off of doctor who right do you know what i'm
talking about yeah so like you remember the tile person at the end of the episode
oh right okay yeah right is that a gender
i like that i work to help you understand a question that makes no sense that was that's
what that was just then i feel i feel bad now doesn't matter she's doggy or anything
what do you think of the halloween franchise you like horror you'll be aware of the halloween
franchise yeah no fan oh wait uh what do you think of slashes in general hey i don't really
why haven't we met sooner i don't i'm a huge fan of horror and i don't like slashes
i thought i said that shit too and you fucking ignore it off wait sorry who are you for the
for the new guest the shiny flashy new guest you can't even stay away prefab you're rags right
excuse me and i dropped my fucking mic on the floor no i always thought that i was in the minority
odyssey what i because i'm a big fan of horror myself but when i watch slashes when i was a
younger age i didn't get it i was like why are these good is that like oh they don't know anything
died but you know you know i i've said this on stream before i think predator ruined slashes for
me because predator is like one of the best slashes you'll ever watch actually scary though
you've got a really powerful intelligent enemy against really powerful intelligent people
who make good decisions that's why i like it no we have to split up and watch the basement
halloween there's yeah maybe if we split up in the woods we'll find safety fans no
halloween nightmare on elm street as even though i like nightmare on elm street it just doesn't
the thing i like about everyone so is is the dream aspect it's cool look the dream aspect yeah
yeah but like friday the 13th as well it's just like okay just kill him i don't know i don't care
none of these people are likable don't give a fuck no um no for me uh i find that uh that kind
of stuff is is boring but um in terms of the slashers and and uh the the more physical um
horror stuff what's the best is horror that can't be quantified um horror that is um existential
that's good horror
that because aden do you like soma yeah good that was the correct answer that is the only correct
answer have you ever seen plague of gripes do you guys know him no no okay he's a do you uh know
the two best friends play kind of guys okay well plague of gripes is a associate i suppose if there
is he has a series on youtube it's a bunch of i think altogether it's maybe 30 minutes long
but it's just called um let's gripe about horror and he animates it and it's his opinions on horror
and it's a mate he's completely correct about almost everything of just being like okay what's
what makes something scary is it scary because i'm oh it's a spider oh my god now we've come full
circle 17 hours later is it scary because spiders are scary or is it scary because i have
a personal fear of spiders rather than trying to limit yourself to it as a creator rather than
trying to limit yourself to being like oh well some people are afraid of spiders you have to be able to
con uh connect with with true universal fears which are more based on general concepts it's
what it's about you know when when it turns into the spider in the book or as proceed as the spider
that's just some one person's interpretation of what it is because it is a manifestation of fear
that's cool shit yeah i love that kind of stuff i just i love fears as a concept rather as a
manifestation of whatever you believe that you're afraid of uh fear that almost like makes your brain
do all the work in some ways can be much more effective than i'm assuming you've seen hostel
where i was watching that i was like all right yeah oh that's gross you really you chop that
guy up neat got him oh look at that flesh pouring all of that that's gross like okay yeah that's just
really boring it's like i watch a clip on youtube maybe and just get the same thing i guess
uh where am i apparently remarkable republican wants on efap he said he reached out or something
can you confirm or deny all i know is that apparently he said he wants to debate and he
put a comment on one of the videos saying that like i kind of covered it earlier but me and rags
are not exactly like i don't care whether or not c3po is a gay butler i just yeah i just don't care
sorry that's kind of where we're at right now um it's just as far the heart
but like oh they're addressing you right
father and the next one just says i nutted
well i mean i i almost did congratulations i'm proud of you if a lesser man probably
i don't even know how i would finish that a lesser man dot dot dot
uh what do you think of robin hood men in tights very amusing great funny jay jay
probably fucking hates it and he shit what do you mean but we love it it's great
it is great you know what i have to we should have addressed that the the the shock of jay
hating space balls isn't the fact that he hates it it's the fact that he's seen it at all it's
like whoa yeah like it's it's a compounded shock that he's seen it and he hates it it's like whoa
whoa we're still reeling from the shock of the first one don't hit us with the follow-up combo
shot yet jay give us a moment to steady our combo breaker combo shitty opinion has rags ever been
with another man i need to know so i can add it to the lore yeah uh also hi mauler hello oh shit i
mean rags oh well i mean oh shit yeah i can still i'm still here uh serious super chat time
i don't know if it's been asked but what do you think of 250k fine for calling someone an illegal
alien in new york city i think it's obviously stupid you does that a thing you can be fine
that much what's what's the most offensive thing that i could say about a a um undocumented
migrant an occupant did did prove that you came from space and you did illegally it's like a
homeless person they're not they're they're in between opportunities i mean i'd like to find the
most offensive thing just to say it just because hey as long as i still have my first and second
amendment rights i'm gonna 250k holy shit that's new york i don't live in new york i'd have to
google the deets on that because that sounds crazy that sounds like me uh j er and easy peasy
guest for steven universe efap movies make it happen uh you're an easy peasy i'd love to see
happen discussion about steven universe i mean the problem is it requires either me or rags or
both of us to be there me and rags don't give a single fuck about steven universe i'm sure rags
doesn't even know what it is well okay jay does hey but right she's not she's just a guy
you know he's not one of the he's not just the man they should all they should i'm just saying
they should all have a conversation with each other well get jay to host it he's got a channel
do it jay do it get er an easy peasy apparently of things do that yeah you guys probably have
you guys you understand that when you had him on here live is it the first time he's i think
he's ever been on a live stream with anyone are you talking about yeah yeah yeah he told us that
lost their fucking minds yeah i did realize that we were the ones who christened him into the live
world but uh we're gonna try and get him back as well he came on for the 50th too he's um it's
crazy er said that he'd only ever been other than what he when he talked to us he said he'd been in
one other call and he'd never been live because they because i he and i have talked a couple
times mostly publicly but i've tried to get him on shit before he's elusive he is a he's an
elusive bastard in a good way he's a sneaky man um sneaky man the sneaking uh make it happen also
hello jay hi rags hello hello more hello i put bender snatch cumber bunk as a gedelb thanks
i think put him as a gedelb that doesn't make sense you want to do his voice for gedel because
you know you the gedelb voice has to stay the same that's the one thing that remains consistent
about gedel uh nice to hear the term bander snatch cumber bun though it's using my favorite
version of that nickname that really there's so many good ones though i like really like the
under snatch cumber bun it's a good one there's a couple i heard that were pretty good from uh
between two friends i mean off there's there's a generator online but what was the one at least he
says uh i had um i had a a cucumber bumblebee one time i looked at that one he's instead of
benedict he says benefits and then instead of cumber badge he says like something like a
profession and like he says benefits wait we're talking about bendergum pumperdink we need to
get to the next super chat yes go forward i just it was funny i can't remember what it was that
i feel better nice to to hear that it's cool to be born in october my son's birth is due in less
than a month oh well that'll line up perfectly oh congratulations will to be born in october
even though batwoman as a tv show will be born in october i am so sorry about that you'll never forget
uh went to sleep woke up still going wow hi rags
hello stick desk in stephen universe efap movie for fun i don't why do we have to watch stephen
universe for efap movies can we do things like doom doom is better sorry rewatch red letter media
half in the bag on force awakens not good jay said it's better than return of the jedi because
the characters like han got to do stuff again the one thing you've got to really consider with that
and i'm not i'm not trying to defend their takes as uh in what's the word uncritusizable i don't know
but they did record it like they usually do which is immediately after seeing it
which if i had done that i would have said a whole bunch of things that i would now be like
you're full of shit that's not true so also take into account that now like every video they make
fun of those movies yeah you have adam constant if you want us to like say the video on force
awakens half in the bag isn't very good so yeah that's fine but if you want us to say like address
their take on it and judge it from that video i'd be like i don't think that's their take anymore
yeah i think i've definitely started to they've definitely shifted
i'm so addicted to efap that i'm watching rewatching every episode hola rags hola
as a hawaii pineapple on pizza is racist and gay it is both of those things and i do not support it
it hate has no place on this pizza yes agreed uh my favorite doggo my favorite paladin mola i found
you through tlj and loved the video j i will have to look into your content
uh aden your thoughts on young justice blue beetle and season three or s3
okay well i haven't seen it i know it's out i haven't seen it yet but
young justice was amazing i have to watch the new season just haven't seen it yet so i can't
give any more opinions other than that but can't just this is amazing blue beetles a great character
of all all blue beetles hi both Jaime and rais and um uh ted cord so yeah i'm genuinely happy
with that stuff the end right can we have an intervention that every time someone is a tlj
apologist we just get them on and do an intervention they don't always come on quinton would never come
onto this podcast so oh hell no like the idea looks like just bring him on it's like we can't
just bring him on it's not gonna happen no i mean lately tried to do that with um on you know quinton
also got a lot of flack from uh stay at the youtube podcast with number 11 yeah well we we
went off the following podcast being rags did we also the way after you remember that rags
which one now were you you did you guys go on um stay at the youtube yeah we went on soon after
quinton did because we had some insight that was funny shit oh wait yes yes i do remember that now
shit okay uh they at least got him to come on and talk because usually the way that he
responds to his detractors is just haters just haters and and blows it off but he went on their
thing so i don't know if you wanted to if you really wanted to get quinton on you probably should
talk to em blemmon or somebody like that i guess gonna be unlikely to ever he really doesn't like
me like he's got a big stick up his butt about me like not even just quinton yeah yeah like i'm
pretty sure he has issues with rags as well but i have a feeling that he really doesn't like me
because what we found out from different sources he thinks you're all he thinks you're all nazis he
certainly thinks i am now i couldn't believe he didn't have me blocked until i mean now he does
yeah you made sure to fix that oh yeah oh oh absolutely he did because basically yeah he got
fucking butt blasted that people um tagged him when i released my video on him and
briefly after then he decided to drop contra points and and decided to abandon his new queen
because she was getting cancelled and we have to always go along with whatever we think will get
us the most fucking views you know what i'm gonna go back to monday matt for a second there were
something that monday matt said in all those audio leaks where he said like i don't understand
i gotta figure out like how to act like a normal human so that i can get views and the thing is
dude if you have to pretend to act like a normal human i don't think it's gonna work out for you
man if if you're not a normal person then be an interesting person who's just not normal
that people wouldn't want to see well i'm a massive artist according to my fans
but if if you have to be like oh i have to like plan out how i'm going to act like a normal
normal person that's the kind of shit that makes people not like you of having to pretend to be a
person having to pretend to to react normally to shit which is what i think quinton's doing a lot
when uh i first released those tlj critique videos apparently quinton was intending to
annihilate them that was his goal like i'm gonna make a response directly to them he only gave up
because of how long they were which is just brilliant considering yeah i just this is what
i mean when they generate the narrative i make them long to stop people from responding to them
i'm just like uh you could literally just take a portion respond to a piece of an argument i've
made as long as it's full because the idea isn't that another theory is like i i will always have
extra context to justify my awful position right like i'll say poopy bad and then they go see you
said poopy bad and i go but later i say the poopy bad means poopy good so you're wrong and that's
how they they think i work but like when i say canto bite as a whole it's like just a single
criticism that they left the kids behind and it's pretty fucked up you can address that there's not
going to be any additional context i'm criticizing rose as being someone who's desperate to to
represent those who are downtrodden she frees those animals she just doesn't give a shit about the
slaves it's weird it doesn't make a lot of sense it shows poor character on her part as well as
fins you can address that there's not going to be some kind of weird you know what i i've had this
issue myself because again i make weird like hour plus long videos about social science and people
will often times bring up very pedantic tiny little things and it's like okay does it have
anything to do with the overall meaning of what i'm saying and that is the problem where when
people have come after me they've come after my person my personality you know um my appearance
stuff like that it doesn't matter because they know that having to actually take a look at the
argument and put it in context even if you only want to take out like a 20 minute period and
criticize that which you're more than welcome to do that you still have to put it into the context
with the entire piece instead what i found people do exclusively is cut something out of context
and then just use a 15 second clip and repeat it and blast it over and over and just say this this
is representative when everyone who knows anything about it knows that it's not it's just um that's
the frustrating part of all this shit oh i had the same thing happen to me uh i was making an
argument about how if you think so like anything you reference in a movie being bad be it
inconsistencies of character plot world whatever uh if you treat that as a bad thing in a film
but maintain that tlj is good then you're being a hypocrite and i i phrase it in a way that can
be cut out where i say that um if you say that tlj is good good luck trying to argue that other
films are bad and before that i reference all the shit that's relevant to that point
but people cut out and they argue that what i'm trying to say is that um you're not allowed to
like anything if you think the last no you're supposed to like everything if tlj is good
because you can't dislike anything else if tlj is uh not bad it's pedantry yeah it's like of course
i'm not saying that that's never something i would say you just like argue against something that's
a bit more substantive please but quinton well it's one of the things he argued against yes
it what's always about trying to find a gotcha on it you know not about actually arguing in good
faith and understanding and and and being reasonable about what you know the other person is arguing
um i found this for years now in my time doing shit on youtube that generally speaking people
will just make up the most unfavorable version of the argument that they could possibly
pretend that you are having it has nothing to do with reality it's all bullshit uh and and quinton
is certainly one of those people who kind of goes along with that sort of shit so i'm not surprised
yeah quinton quinton doesn't have the greatest reputate represent rep repeat i'm trying to combine
representation and reputation in the same word for no reason representation i feel like my brain
might be melting but that would i'm fucking yeah that would make sense so kicking on um
this is for dale's use of southern accent when someone speaks in a southern accent you're supposed
to sound dumb but on the flip side you sound more sincere it's a give and take accent uh i wished
another got it as well i mean when dale used it as i believe fringy highlighted who's mainly using
it but this is stupid person accent or at least that's the message we got i don't think it was
trying to be sincere uh even if he was trying to be since like trying to represent sincerity it's
not exactly a good thing because he was always trying to put across bad points with it so it's
like i sincerely believe these bad points like again not not uh luke doesn't count remember what
remarkable republicans said he's an aged lesbian you're only halfway there halfway there quinton
round two anyone a remarkable republican feels that luke is a lesbian i'm not sure exactly what
it means for the star wars franchise as a whole but it is definitely something he stands i woke
up efap was running i'm going to sleep efap is still going good night someone in chat said uh
how long is this going for like as soon as i finish super chats that's how it always works
i'm still not quite there yet i'm getting there i see your hyphen unhyphen reading super chats
i see you are hyphen unhyphen i'm gonna gonna move on because the time it would take to decipher
that might this is objectively the lamb sauce Martha i don't see there's a lot of deciphering
that has to happen with these super chests and like it's only going to delay me trying to figure
them out as riddles um why did you say that name some of his superman was a very good film according
to some people aden is the best guest she's broken everyone oh no did you break everybody
did i i by what just passing out in front of her my lack of i don't know does that mean you
broke this is officially the greatest episode of all time hashtag maiden
fair enough if this is the greatest episode all time i'm assuming they referred to 44 rather than
45 all both i don't know as an actual christian who would argue that religion and science aren't
contradictive everything about what the teacher said was wrong and idiotic this is the thing uh
she she was very aggressive under the second eye this this wide-eyed naive student saying
different things about stuff i'd learned she could have handled it way better but you get that uh in
different places religious educators that are very much like hey trying to save you from damnation
idiot oh god yep what does the welsh red dragon picture mean uh red dragons like i said it's art
it's art it's arthur's crust fucking badass doesn't need to need anything on the fucking dragon
doesn't need any moment arthur as an uther pen dragon yes what is the crust of arthur what is
what does the japanese flag mean is it a butt is it an anus it's a rising sun no but it also is a butt
it's a big red it's a red angry asshole it's an angry asshole holy shit this has been the greatest
efap dying yeah we are dying is a good word uh can someone answer this age-old question

oh well what a great first super chat because it was to us if you were a sim what would your
aspiration be whatever my creator had designed for me yeah Jesus well if you if you were a sim
you'll see your spiders are in need of a walk that's true i need to walk my spiders
so they get their exercise uh testing to see if i can super chat into new stream oh there you go raw
apparently it's working again steamed oh thank goodness what would we do without raw super chats
letting you know what he thinks of all the things uh themed memes matter true hell yeah i'm back like
gandalf holes that's that's wrong in star wars the phantom waffle hashtag waffle lives matter oh
this is when i believe peaks and gamers had done a raid and i'm sorry i missed i was very distracted
uh remember dr mihai cheeks sent mihai i i do the legend who he probably studied under
the teachings of bigidious i don't want to claim anything i remember mihai cheeks like he may have
since i wasn't able to bankrupt myself on super chats today i spent all of the stream instead
playing dragon ball fighter z first time playing a fighter game ever conclusion fighter games are
cancer meant for turbo artists oh i agree okay i turbo auto but i disagree but let me show you the
way let me show you the light of how to enjoy a fighting game do it because okay first thing you
got to do is that you got to like um go out onto the edge of a pier or something and just shake
shake your body out because you've got way too much salt in there you get that salt out
just shake it out first and then you can go inside and you can play your fighting game
but you've got too much salt in your blood right now my dude gotta get rid of it no no fighting
games are for turbo artists oh well raw said has raw ever been wrong
i i mean i'm a turbo artist so maybe that's why i like them i don't know maybe in fact it probably
just aren't we all turbo artists like come on not me right now i'm a i'm a slow artist
i am not i'm not on turbo mode i'm in economy mode right now i got the eco button flipped on
oh goodness zach said break the legs lord rah people are encouraging rah
oh my goodness don't you draw please by the way the guy who made the animated shorts very based
i was from rah rah proves of the animated shorts oh wow that's a level of that's a level of praise
that very many aspire to yet very few achieve j knowing so much doctor who stuff explains why
he doesn't know many movies also for the love of the cosmic chicken go to sleep all of you
some rules are made to be broken we are working on it i had a good nine hour sleep efap is still
going yes yes having watched through nine ten eleven and stopping after season one of twelve
with the maths teacher bf in order i can honestly say that i prefer matt smith as the doctor but
ten's adventures were better fair enough yeah tony stock dies in endgame jay unapologetically
no characters die in endgame he said no one dies in the fight does he clarified that that tony stock
dies after the fight so j j hour one of episode 55 go to sleep damn it i'm getting there we're
definitely moving faster now sleep well aden i'm awake now but i'm gonna go to sleep soon
multiplications and divisions are evaluated from left to right one doesn't take precedence over
the other same for addition and subtraction yeah oh yeah pemdas is just a helpful mnemonic
bid mass is better because we made it pemdas either way it's it's a mnemonic device either
way pemdas sounds like a pelican pemdas would be a terrible pelican name i but it is a pelicans
would have plain normal names like carl steve frank jim pemdas is that one guy i i would like
like a name steve to be honest pelican steve i'm not steve
ipcc is running a scam with billions in bribes given to foreign state advisors so they can create
a new trading market for carbon credits literally trillions in profit to early members like al gore
i have no idea what you're talking about what uh throw their legs off a rooftop oh my goodness
oh he's talking about the flag at that point the three legs that seems to make
imagine believing climate change crap when everyone pushing it has been proven wrong
every single time they've made a prediction and exposed for corrupt carbon credits shilling
practices globally it's raw i feel like raw i don't know what this had to do with what we were
covering but i understand i don't i don't know where it came from but it's right i guess
aden wouldn't have fallen asleep if you just kicked jay mauler when will you learn your inaction has
consequences i mean it is it is interesting you woke up soon after jay left i don't know what we're
supposed to because what do we what do we know the thing it's funny okay so i've known rags you
know i've known she had that for a long time i've i think the only person i've ever not had any
communication with was jay but i watch his content so you know rags she she previously
pulled everyone she hates jay in different conversations is this true no i actually watch
and like his content i don't think i've ever even said anything about this is a habitual liar right
rags why does she hate jay can you give us context for this jay she's lying to cover up jays
ineptitude because jay has an issue with um assessing the quality of films as we've seen
he doesn't even he doesn't even like combing the desert which is not acceptable i thought you were
gonna say he doesn't even like coming to america in which case um he probably doesn't like america
yeah come not isn't like if someone doesn't like coming to america i'm sorry sometimes there's bad
takes jay and then there's bad i think it's time to say jay hates america jay is bad takes the
person jays wow he's a bad takes me she is a bad take i have i have no reason to believe any of
this but i'm going to pretend that i believe it yeah also jay looks like heiner kimler yeah so
i don't i don't know what other the truth is the truth the truth is the truth what can you say
i mean yeah well now i believe it um so what are we talking about now that i'm here climate change
or something super cats dude were we were we talking about i don't remember talking about
climate change my plane landed i despise jay really i do rod doesn't like jay
20 hours of looking at aden i'm on hi rags hello forgot to super chat this hours ago
galaxy is greater than space balls uh why is my brain blanking you're talking about
the one with tim alan right aden help me out what's the movie name why is the what's the
movie name of that galaxy quest galaxy quest a great great space galaxy quest is often
put against space balls as like which one do you prefer i'm no they they both are good for
different reasons i was going to say is a very interesting sort of um if you've ever seen the
documentary trekkies it more is reminiscent of the logical um outcome or end result of the trekkies
documentary what's the thing i i've always categorized it myself as space balls is almost
making fun of star wars and galaxy quest is making fun of star trek yes and they are not the same
thing they're not the same thing i love galaxy quest though that's right i might say more than
more than space balls but i'm not going to say what was better or anything i just i love galaxy
quest as funny as hell the guy was the red shit uh he's so obsessed with the fact he's going to
die he's like you don't even know my name i don't even know my name it's good shit uh
uh 2049 is one of the only few films worth a damn made in the last decade anyone who disagrees
deserves to be publicly executed to set an example i disagree rah i just i was about to say i think
you know it's like anyone could have wrote that uh of course it's right yeah blade runner 2040 died
i'll take a critical position on that sure gimme uh what do you guys use to watch your movies
my computer my pc yeah we don't know there's no like we don't like watch together doesn't work
obviously we just use me like sink yeah we just sink and then watch sink and watch sink and watch
sink and watch man that's what we do we just deal it's still sink and watch you've heard
of netflix and chill but bro have you ever tried out that sink and watch you ever tried out efep
and chill trans people are plot holes mauler did i say trans people are plot holes i don't
remember saying that no no i don't think you said that um aren't you excited for a possible
brie larson star wars movie it's so repulsive and morbidly grotesque that you can't stop looking at
yeah i'm super excited for it because wow is that a really dumb idea it's great i don't think that's
going to happen but if it does wow oh how dumb do you think they are yes i think that they're maximum
i think they're max yes i think they're yes maximum dumb so i think they're gonna do stupid
and just do the stupidest thing i could possibly do which is to give brie larson who is hated by
everyone a starring role because that's how dumb they are um just make a mouthful and blow we know
you've done it before jay what is that in reference oh my goodness mauler check your discord for my
request sent link send through twitter i get i've got so many notifications on discord i'm not
checking them right now and once i do once the stream is over it's going to be tough to go
through every single one and make sure i know which ones are irrelevant or not this is why
when you ping me on discord people and i don't react to it it's probably because sometimes i
don't catch them all but but yeah it's probably because he's busy streaming twitter is the better
place to go especially when i'm streaming because it's like i'm updating it so yeah hey rags hey
hello hey mauler hello love you guys i still own the four disc blade runner pc game but have no
idea to how to run it on windows 10 i i'm sorry about that yeah you might have to find some
emulation software i'm not sure look for some guides how long has aden been asleep and when
did you start uh i don't know i think i was asleep for like one hour first time but now i envy
yeah i don't know when all of it happened at times i think i've had a whole of like three hours of
yeah it's it's it's complicated that's that's the answer at rags tell mauler about your nazi
loli adventures mauler i play a game and in that game i'm a i'm a proud member of hitler's
glorious third rike but cherry on top we are also vampires in service to the fatherland
so we role play as nazi vampires killing communists working with they're working
with the ss you know just doing you know hashtag just nazi things and that's what our role play is
on uh arch warhammers channel he is the gm of that adventure through the forties here here's
a question i have to be very honest with you rags you can say it because he's not here
who's the better gm in your opinion is it arch or is it bill well actually when we have the q&a
someone asked me this as well my answer my answer still stands that they both have their strengths
and weakness but they both give a different experience and i can appreciate them both
that i think a lot of gms like answer no no it's true though it's not a cop out answer
it really is true and i i strive to be truthful if that's what you want to call it that's fine
anyway moving on i'm i'm just i'm just taking notes i'm just taking notes to report back to bill
well i bill already knows because i answered a question but yeah i think it's like with a lot
of people it's like they do things that they're good with but almost as a result because there
are time constraints and things like that or personal preferences you know you might have
a weakness as a result of the strength you know it's kind of a give and take because you can't
you can't do everything you know so one person does one thing stronger and the other person does
another thing stronger and they both kind of you know they got their pluses and minuses and i and i
enjoy them both and i like them both and if i didn't like them i wouldn't play the game
oh yeah and that's absolutely true absolutely okay cool there was like this coward answer
was like no it's the honest okay call to rags like dog properly this time
call to rags like dog what does that mean like
call to rags like no no like call to me like i like i am your dog and you wish me to i'm sorry
the jay isn't here to fulfill such a thing but i will jay tried once and he failed him yeah but
there's no reason why i can't save that and have him fail to do it next time he's here as well
that's very true you better save that one and put in your back pocket for later i'm doing whenever
we need a jay put down stalls episode nine the rise of skyle ben oh yes skyle ben speaking of
nintendo regular reminded regular reminded to efap sassy and opinionated's ultimate ultimate
zelda conspiracy theory video also high rugs hello hello and i would like to note that it's
not a cop out answer because a cop-out answer would would be that they're they're both great
and i love them both however i did that but i added on the fact that they both do things
that i don't really care for and i think they both have weaknesses so that's not a cop-out
answer i didn't go with the i think also i'm so fucking tired i can't even think
so i know that might play a little bit into it hey guys love your stuff here's five bucks go buy
me some jerky oh i have jerky right next to me i feel like you have jerky out good protein hi rags
i'm gonna have some hello love you oh well that's awfully nice i believe you and i think you said

western guy oh but the complexity is on the cover but i eat these and i just go i don't know
30 ounces at a time they'll say they're sold by choo choo r snacks don't go around telling people
you're eating buffalo bills jiggy that's all i'll say yeah just a good just a good point i really
have not been able to have a cigarette in 16 hours or whatever now it i'm gonna go smoke
if i'm if you're still online when i come back we will be i'll be i seriously might not be
i'm i'm just i'm hanging on by the skin of my teeth i that's how i need a cigarette otherwise
i'm gonna die i'll be right back it's actually the opposite is true um oh yeah yes but i want my
death stick i want my death stick i'll be right back you you you should go home and rethink your
life but i go home and rethink my life such a shitty joke and i love it uh anyway i sent too
many super chats to people today oops fair enough but thank you still again uh orphans and should
have been abortions what feces that there's a little super chat that just says feces rags
what am i supposed to do with this i don't know it's shit wait yo it's 3am you absolute mad lads
also hi rags oh god it's actually eight now jesus christ in a fucking hand basket oh my god
hi rags you can't let that go hello hello still today in hawaii gotta go two more hours at least
no no my guess is one more hour and then we're really actually done i'm not even kidding
hick j did it's fine rags do you think angry joe is only good for games yes and even then he's
okay his movie reviews what his movie reviews are j level of aids to watch
log bad good how long can a long man be but well anything longer than half an hour is almost
recognized as log bad these days so there you go also can you do a video on how to defend tlj
no why would we do that when we know it's not true how to lie the video
how to bullshit i think we're a little bit too mean to j love you j oh i think that that's not
true that was taylor ramirez and then the next one says taylor ramirez is lying game and j hoe j
what who is efaps apex homosexual i vote rags
that limits rags to the one gender slash sex you can't have that
you gotta you gotta get him more access i i can fill in for the gay if necessary but i think of
the regulars that uh it's it's probably not supposed i too am an october baby mine is on the
eighth hey two days after me or not to remover you guys made my day after my boss yelled at me
oh sorry about that no sorry that your boss yelled at you but maybe had it coming have you considered
doing a separate stream for super chats with each efap since they're getting so long now
well that's what this is they're only gonna happen you know when they have to happen like
something we don't have to necessarily the reason that they take so long is because one we have an
extremely generous audience of course but two it's because we go into fucking tangents about
pimdos and the stuff and then all of a sudden a one dollar 50 donation turns into a 45 minute
stream tangent and then we wonder why we were up for 16 hours or whatever
water that's the important uh wait no i said that you were going to turn into a money launderer
because people tell you to pass on money to others on the show oh i get it i mean you could
still argue that both portions of those transfers are money laundering but yes i i hate doing laundry
especially money laundry money gets all dirty with like blood and drugs you gotta wash it all
out and dry it and i um yeah lol that was about ray not aden daisy ridley talked about ray using
dildos in an interview total fumbrain oh i don't feel like that's something she would say she's got
to be she's got to be official and you know not offensive in her interview i can't i can't imagine
she was you're still going i know what i'm catching up on during my days off also hi rags hello
if any of you played greedful and if so what are your thoughts i haven't played it yet but it's
kind of on my maybe list here oh hi metal mel's popped in like three different times
before he went to sleep after he went to sleep before he went to work and work is almost over
that's effort i'm traveling uh it's also good night aden she would say thank you well if she
was currently smoking um so glad you watched bone tomahawk my favorite film of all time
maybe i can't separate myself from it enough to be objective though which is why i'm so interested
in your thoughts on it i don't want to spoil anything in case rags does want to see it but
i thought it was pretty cool and i really enjoyed the characters i liked how simplistic the story
was it's person gets kidnapped they go and try and save you simple as that and bad there's a lot
of creepy elements to it there's that horrifying moment uh kurt russell was awesome in it and i
think that he needs to do more cowboy roles before entering into too old territory to do it makes a
good um it's episode 54 not 55 you massive apex gay jay don high but it is we've already established
our of competency with math okay yeah give us a break we've been up for three years yeah we're
going to be a little confused yeah and it is the 50 actually it's the 50
70 fap right no 50 yeah 57th right because add in two for part two and three of 50 oh yeah that's
true and then this one so four five six yeah this is actually efap 57 that what he just said
that's the truth right there yeah i'm surprised i was able to count that high in my state
jesus man not like arkansas like obvious acting you know for a second there i actually did think
like where's rags estate and why is that relevant that's what he just said i know we're a bunch of
hillbilly rednecks but we can count 55 um
jesus man i went to bed hours ago when i woke up you're still going there's so many of those
messages for the 50th i can't believe we're having those same ones for this one six and a half hours
plus 11 17 and a half hours we're really like not even too far away from a 24-hour stream that's
absolutely nothing aden you know maybe if i keep maybe if i keep hearing over and over oh my god
aren't you ever going to sleep it'll help me stay awake aden there's someone who reads a lot of
research papers if you ever come across the secret of mario's okay i'm gonna save that for
me
oh i'm crying tears you're good enter control v enter there we go i did it
someone told me that tlj was not about law or plot but about the characters
sad thing is a star wars youtuber i like was convinced by to like tlj by this
uh how is it that the characters aren't fucked in that film i do not understand if someone said
like if you ignore the plot and the law characters are great characters are no they're not
adding to the count boys love y'all rhino milk mola could you get a definitive star wars
question from aden if she's awoken by the time you read this she said both po and fin i think
she went with fin or at least that's what i've got her written down as i think she was more she
mentioned po being another suggestive thing but she was definitely more uh going with fin um and
then it ends with coo rags aden were you going in for po or fin overall with your i wasn't considering
question uh to me uh fin for sure thought it was also this is a really important question
uh aden and this is aden as someone who reads a lot of research papers have you ever come
across the secret of mario's jump you know what i have not and well and and here's the thing
that i uh specifically have been studying video games for a long time and even with natural
mapping i wouldn't have any idea about any kind of super secret behind mario's jump however i
would imagine it's it's because he eats a lot of mushrooms to make a very old oh you can't no
there's no answer to it mark brown made a whole video about how there's no real answer to it
but we covered it we learned that it's the magic of the question you never answer it
that's so stupid um no you can answer every question nope you if you can't answer it it's
not a good question all right try and answer this question what's the meaning of life
that's that is okay the meaning of life is i would say subjective no i thought you're going
to reference oh no i no no oh that's too easy oh 42 everyone says that to the point it's like
the cake is a lie it's got people burn that shit out and no they did it's still nice it's a lot
there's plenty of things we say that i totally drove into the we've gone so late that it's daylight
hours and we can worry your side of the planet what is side of the planet we can worry uh hello
we can worry i sent you the the meme that you're in on discord sign in and you'll find a link to it if
you haven't seen it already it's very good we showcased it on efap but yeah see all of chat
saying 42 you know it's not dead it's still alive heard i know it's not dead it's not what i'm
saying it doesn't matter if it's dead it's so overused what's the meaning of life 42 i too
i'm aware of this statement is like yeah but that's hilarious that's you you guys sucks supposed
it's like now when now whenever you ask the question you know what's the meaning of life
then you have to obligatory it is that you have to roll your eyes i mean i didn't actually expect
aiden to actually run out with a full essay explaining the meaning of life i wasn't going
to put her through that at this point of the street let me tell you something let me tell you
something doesn't matter how tired i am don't ask me questions because i'll answer with research
no it's don't ask me questions time just just don't ask me questions don't ask questions
because if you ask questions you're gonna get an answer it's gonna be a long and complicated answer
and and that's why people don't like still still gonna ask you some questions i don't know what
they'll be and i don't know when they'll be but they'll happen they'll be later all i can
recommend now is not to die long man i'm still here so is rags we're doing just fine we're
present here at this location speaking of diversity just came across a rumor that daniel
craig gets killed off in the first 10 minutes into the bond film and the rest is the black lady from
captain marvel replacing him with some flashbacks apparently there's a scene in which he talks to
ralph finds m about how agents like bond are no longer needed just kill me already uh let's talk
about let's talk about some realized shit let me let me put this out right so monica rambo who was
captain marvel before carol danvers was captain marvel in the comics is amazing and i would love
for her to get her own stand-alone movie in the form of next wave because next wave if you've not
read it is just a comic about assholes it's always sunny it's always sunny but with superheroes
that's it that should be a movie marvel why do you fuck this shit up because you can't
fucking think that's why you what again i i was talking about this other day rags uh i don't know
how much your content is too but like the problem is like oh we have to have more female representation
well guess what there's an excellent pair of space lesbians involved in the um a guardian
galaxy mainline story yeah yeah where are my space lesbians i was there when you spoke
of the space lesbians yes and i know but they're great characters they should be
but are they great lesbians oh they're great lesbians one of those bald
which one do you make one of them is bald bald bald yeah as in she has no hair no hair right like
on her head well that's just what we know
you can make your own decisions and your own speculations but
you know where else there may be can't say can't say i'm a huge fan of the bald ladies
the wigs right uh not a huge but my point is my point is it's not a huge deal that's what marvel
wants to go if they wanted to be woke and have female characters where is file of l and moon dragon
yeah well guys don't like the super the the weirdly shaped unnaturally colored bright green hair
let's just go the other way you're bald
i i just think that people would like it i also think that if they put if they put um
so okay so if you if you do next wave not only do you get to use monica rambo who has been introduced
but you can put in elsa bloodstone who is essentially the buffy of the marvel universe
i approve of this whatever that means she's literally buffy like in terms of the character
she's literally buffy uh she's a vampire hunter and and she's a teenage girl when she
that's right because she has special vampire hunting powers yes she's buffied vampires what
the hell did they do no i mean it's the same thing with buffy where like she's given special
powers to fight vampires regardless of her celestial choice it's celestial lesbian
someone posted that that's something they've read that just thought it was funny
because the implications to be a lesbian at the celestial scale i don't know what it means but
also get through this shit that star wars girl actually asked brown table if he'd be willing to
come on efap and i like that someone commented on it saying fuck you backed him into a corner if
he refuses a woman it's sexual harassment oh god whole brine table he doesn't know what to do now
we're we're a clever bunch the toxic brood yep we know our way around you don't get to be the
size of a brew without making a few enemies a lot that's true die a brood you live long enough to
see yourself become a brown table outside okay i i want i i want to go continue to smoke my
cigarette so because i figured out the time being yes my cigarette so let's continue through things
right india and china have four of the five largest solar plants in the world they're doing
what they can for climate change considering their overpopulation issues no they're fucking
not don't you buy that's such a bullshit statement you know that they do i don't know fuck all about
it so i'm just like okay we're doing china and then you're doing all they can rags you know that
indians shit in the street they're doing what they can for global warming they're doing all they can
yeah for global shitting yes global shitting global shitting it's like why are you trying to
outpace the cows don't know apparently metal's being deleted just like they're trying to outpace
pewdiepie they have to be number one number one in in uh methane emissions number one in youtube
subs metal if you're being bullied in chat maybe there's a reason i don't know i'm just saying
i don't know yeah metal maybe you haven't done so there's a hint there it's just the natural
results of the decisions that you've made in which case we must leave you to your fate so
you may learn a valuable list still going also hello again rags hello again tweeted out another
doodle to you more happy to draw arts for efap community thank you all for brightening up my day
with each and every stream hopefully i appreciate the artists who draw already yeah i'm not sure
which particular one it was but hopefully we covered it yeah we we we really do enjoy looking
at the memes they absolutely are they are very funny and some of them are very talented like
the guy who did jay's strange face that was that was awesome that's extremely talented work
like very very talented that you could do that that takes an incredible amount of skill um
star wars episode nine how to unsuck a deke
deke all right play cotol one two one and two i guess best star wars stories objectively
yes yeah that's probably true i don't know i haven't played them i'm gonna get around to it
one day oh play oh my dude you got to play cotor it'll happen i swear i gotta get to it
luke reconnects to the force 512 unread messages well five five thousand and twelve unread messages
that makes sense um don't sass me beer milk good i've never had beer milk well they have things
like white russian so we have like milk and alcohol yeah but beer is more than just alcohol
beer is more than just alcohol and i don't know what happens when you mix beer and milk i don't
know what happens i just didn't assume it would end up well but maybe it does maybe i'm wrong
i'm sure you could find out right now mauler i don't have any beer you don't have any what
bullshit no i don't have any i don't like beer i like spirits i hate beer wow i love beer but
i hate spirits well looks like we were match made in heaven rags well i guess you just have to go
be a milk drinker you know we both like milk that works out i love milk i drink i've got
like a gallon and a half and see what would happen is you have your beer and milk i would
have my when i wake up in the morning when i wake up in the morning i don't know you like milk
right rags i when i wake up in the morning there's nothing i like more than just a large glass of
milk that's what i drink a lot of milk i drink myself a lot of milk i love it's good sometimes
i'll make it joke and how much of this is is a metaphor and how much there's no metaphor i
enjoy i enjoy the moo juice then i agree i agree because i feel the same way i also enjoy it's
good i love me some moo juice uh aden i live i die i live i die i live again yeah that's that's been
your arc throughout this set of efaps pretty much but but but my libertarian principles are blue
blue laugh my ass off rags beat the fuck out by based aden by what i guess they're referring to
the to the deserve part of this i think that's where we're at with that one i don't know she
agreed with me i i'm a libertarian too so i'm not sure i'm pretty fucking libertarian it's
definitely about the deserved things the next one says in that moment aden sided with wolf on the
bathwater question and rags his heart broke but did he deserve it aden agrees with me in concept
which is the most important it it's me being a pedant i suppose in terms of uh how i view the
term deserved t dat whatever mauler i know you're a long man but this is almost another 24 hour
stream it's not like i'm forcing everyone to be here i just i've got to answer these okay what
you're doing is you're suggesting that we do something at the dinner table in front of the
rest of the family so where you can't possibly or else you'll look like an asshole that's what
you're doing i never did that okay here's here's a quick question this is very important though
because this is a long long long and storied question i'm sorry to pause here but it's very
important based on this so okay would you rather this is an infamous would you rather would you
rather it's christmas morning you are going you have a a present to give to your family members
so you know any grandma granddad any of your all of your aunts uncles all of the family is there
and you're going to put on a dvd for them what is on it you have two options either it's you
blowing a homeless man or you masturbating to completion and then saying merry christmas
what what is on the tape which do you prefer would you rather oh shit i mean if it was the
first one then they know i was fucking gay for homeless dude um i would the second one means
that you're aware they know that you're aware because you're looking into the camera yes oh
yeah because yeah i i understand that but is it better to purposefully masturbating or accidentally
caught blowing a homeless man what's this is why it's the best would you rather because it's it's
i i actually think it's really easy for going right for me it would be the second one i would
rather so you want them to see your your happiness that you're excited they first off i want my dad
to be super proud of his son's big ass dick and also i just i i don't i would i think that is far
better than being like oh yeah oh wait is that our son blowing that homeless oh my god what's
wrong with home because then they'll have to then they'll have to watch a homeless man's orgasm
watch your cum shot or a random homeless person's comes somebody in your chat knows where i stole
my would you rather from but yeah um oh man it's such a fucking great one it's a great would you
rather jettison how attractive this all was bad it's going to change everything we need to know
uh okay uh so uh the next one says hell i've had my eight hours and you're still going yes man this
efe has been one hell of a ride it has indeed we're on the final stretch now people it's just a page
when i say just a page it's not as small as you'd like to think but it's still just a page
let's go deserving itself is an incoherent notion it means that something holds you
someone holds you to an obligation the universe itself you get what you get as consequences
that's that's typically how we say use deserve though deserves often like say that again it's
a deserving itself is an incoherent notion it means that someone holds you to an obligation
the universe itself you get what you get as consequences no that's a silly comment if someone
said rags do you think it's logically consistent for someone to have as a consequence of dealing
with leprosy patients that they get leprosy rags would say yes yeah of course that's logically
consistent however do they deserve it on a moral scale which i think is what rags is going for as
in should they be punished for their works as dealing with the leprosy stricken people yes
in terms of a moral aspect mixed with the issue of worthiness does not imply um moral
um repercussion deservedness just implies statistical um probability i don't agree is that
true i i suppose it's a difference in the understanding or our interpretation of the language
because mine mine would be like well statistical probability so probably it's going to happen
and therefore you deserve it only in that you shouldn't be surprised if you get leprosy when
you work with lepers no because then if it didn't happen then there's like that we've had a a then
you didn't get what you deserve when you should have no no i because i think that deserved there's
definitely a should when it comes to deservedness because i do think that relates to a sense of
deservedness implies a should it just implies hey you did this thing that we knew from every
statistical reason would result in an outcome that wouldn't make it a bad thing if you don't
get leprosy obviously it's just saying that if you do you can say oh hey that's deserved i don't
know i i don't think so i think that it's reasonable for them to get those things just
because it's a it's a conclusion that adheres to the you know the universe we live in
but i think that when we look at deservedness that i still think that there is an inextricable
moral component based on the worth of what you are owed in terms of your punishments and rewards
now deservedness it that does make that does add an element of subjectivity to deserve obviously
but i think that that doesn't pose a problem really to the discussion in particular that's
just a matter of what we are what we think the results of that deservedness should be but we've
already talked about this and i am fucking tired of shit okay no i i get your point it's still very
interesting yeah uh bluela where am i
uh well guess we can't have intercourse with our significant others in the bath shower now
because we are sharing the same water will increase our chance of herpes which we will
we apparently deserve
well i mean if your partner has herpes you should probably be aware of that and take um
there's medicine now that you can take that that's necessary or that that take just take the
necessary what if you don't know what a ridiculous thing if if you love somebody
and they have herpes you can take precautions well no no no i'm saying what if what if you
don't know they have herpes
well i mean you should have these conversations with anyone you're sleeping with
but okay but that's the doesn't really follow they could they could lie to you
right or they could be too ashamed to talk about it or well they shouldn't be
well yeah they shouldn't they shouldn't be i agree they should be truthful the rags is aiming
us does that make the other person okay no like it's oh no no no deservedness hang on
now we're getting down this fucking rabbit hole again okay i'm i'm like i'm gonna make it very very
very clean and and clear as best as i can when i say deservedness i don't mean in terms of a
moralistic stance i mean in terms of you shouldn't be surprised if that happens doesn't mean that you
should if you have if you you know are gay and you have sex with a gay another gay person and
you get eight doesn't mean you deserve eight i think you should be surprised if the person lies
to you if the person lies to you yeah probably be surprised but i just don't um deservedness i'm
sorry in the way that i'm using it is not moralistic it's i'm using it in the statistical
probability sense yeah and i understand and all i would say is that in my experience a connotation
that people use deservedness for is usually tied to some sense of morality like that person deserved
that outcome or that person didn't deserve that outcome is usually tied to what i'm genuinely
shocked that a sense of justice is like i i don't know maybe uh that's just well i think we've had
people say that it's so stupid to drink the water of someone else's bath but yeah you do deserve to
get a disease yeah because i've never heard deservedness be basically used as probability
i you know it's probably just a differentiation in terms of how i perceive stuff right i think
it's fair i just that's not how i would use it molly's a smart man well no i mean i you're just
a filthy smoker what do you know oh no i i really like to finish my fucking cigarette you deserve
you deserve wait what you got what are you gonna say she deserves what do i deserve rags
you deserve lung cancer because you smoke the death sticks i do smoke the death sticks
i also eat of the weed but here's the thing you eat of the weed you do not smoke you eat it
hang on like a big little baby she has animals you don't know but i'll tell you what i have
right now okay rags you know what nerd's rope is right i do know what nerds oh my god nerd's rope
that is a fucking blast from the past except it's a guess what it's made out of nerds
but what yes and another ingredient you killed nudes and made weed out of hard for thc mother
fucker i was about to say i was a oh my goodness okay so i when i was in colorado at silverton
beautiful fucking town when i was up there in silverton they had a little dispensary and we
don't have those here so i went in to look around because that's weird to me because we don't have
those here in arkansas and i never really did the weed ever pretty much just wasn't interested in it
so i bought some edibles there to sneak across state lines and i got home and i had them
and they just didn't do anything for me dude weed lemal is that like i i will tell you this i
when i okay so i was coming back from dc after i bought this nerd's rope thing it was like i'm
just gonna take like a big bite out of it and it'll be fine um no it wasn't no it wasn't no it wasn't
no no because it was way too much you can't take a bite out of this shit i've now had it for like
over a week and i've just been taking like one bite out of it a day holy shit that stuff's insane
wow that's crazy because i because what they said was heavier smoke before i was like no no and so
they said okay just try out half a lot and because i had cookies so they said just take half of one
and see how you feel you know see how intense that is for you and then you can kind of use that to
judge you know what the rest of them will be so i i had the first half of one and he got nothing
so this is weird so i waited a long time because i know it's supposed to kick in later and i wasn't
gonna be like oh that's nothing then eat the whole thing and just get fucking bonkers schlammered
so i waited a while and then the next day i had like a bunch more than that and it didn't do
anything for me it's kind of a shame i was hoping to get something because i'd only heard about it
but now i because i've never been like high really not from weed
that's because i've never been interested but then when i tried it out it just didn't do
anything for me so i'm like oh well curiosity satisfied i guess you know bill didn't get high
when he came over here either i i gave him a whole bunch of like good ass shit he couldn't get stunned
i don't know why everyone's saying tomorrow i'll hit the ceiling no no this was like a
this was no this is like two years ago but i just don't i just don't really
care honestly i just just just don't have any interest in it i was just kind of i was sort of
hoping oh i i guess i guess i'm immune to the weed i guess i'm too lawful good and the weed
doesn't even affect me oh that's that's very interesting uh what are your paladin of again
who is kurgis that's not kurgis i'm sorry it definitely is we've spoken i've got the
caller and the javelin i don't think so i don't think it's kurgis i don't think it's kurgis i

you know feelings are are very subjective and they're not a good way to arrive at justified
systems i'm clearly a paladin of kurgis and in fact it's not even disputable really
i i'm pretty sure that you are legally why do you carry on with this charade this farce of justice
i i mean i don't care about justice i don't deserve this true neutral man i don't deserve this
i'm gonna say i'm i am a paladin of kurgis isn't it pronounced belated a little bit upset here's
a thing that is that um rags kind of got betrayed by accidentally so no here's what happened here's
what happened no no no no no i didn't have a theology degree and this bullshit made up game
religion and so c decided that he wanted something to happen which means it happened and then there
was oh no i'm a paladin of kurgis this is very very very simple is what this is and he's gonna
show up one day i'll be like no no no i might entertain you but no no i'm i'm proud of kurgis

hello oh my wait we're not at 18 are we
this is a seven hour stream and the other one was 11 that would be 18 oh my fucking god it's
terrible actually very close to a 24 hour stream which we had prep for we did lots of prep for that
i didn't prep for this i didn't prep i was i basically woke up like two hours before
the stream was supposed to happen to me so i've been up for 20 hours now yeah you guys
so i'm good but you had two naps you had two naps you see naps so much you forget about other naps
no i know i had two nice they were nice well one nap was very short and the second was a little bit
longer give me a little bit more time a little bit short rags is judging your naps after you
established you were a dog eater 48 hour shows next just all week just never just streamed
forever 24 7 365 oh no you uh you guys are still going and here i was expecting to see the stream
in the archive today it's coming it's gonna pop up there eventually it's coming i needed to turn my
sleep cycle around so i could watch the only screening at my amc for ad astra which is super
late last night this efap did the trick all right good happy to help had dinner went to bed got up
for work traveled to work been working for two hours and you're still going respect also hi rags
hello also don't kick jay uh well he's going he's asleep oh and we got a jay for that and just as
i predicted you're still going three hours later lol get some sleep so the first one where he said
three hours that was at six hours this one is predicting i guess three hours later and we're
we're at seven hours that seems like a ratio that's actually working out so far you know
we're getting there are you serious we're getting close to the end so so get through it
interrupted me to tell me to speed up mauler you interrupted her interrupting you to tell
her that she was interrupting you now i've interrupted you to let you know all that aforementioned
information i like that you let me know so now this is snowballs and this is a perfect explanation
as to how traffic jams happen are you serious i just finished my night shift 6 a.m yes
love my ass off rags i'm sure you'll be ready to go back to work by the time we're finished with super
chats love my ass off rags i unironically told a rude annoying girl she was a pillsbury doe boys
michelin ma'am michelin ma'am at a tail it's ma'am michelin ma'am michelin ma'am oh my god i gotta
remember a great michelin ma'am any possibility of an e-fab music review at some point
maybe the wall people who think music can't be objectively critiqued have the big gay
uh i don't have enough experience breaking music down to be able to do that and i don't have
enough of an interest in it to really get into music reviews also the copyright would be a
nightmare to me the youtube is very testy about music you'll play just a couple of seconds they'll
be like hey put that down you're like oh sorry sorry about that um this one just says what was
that mauler don't oh that's referencing 24 hour fap here we come oh this is when i said don't send
anymore which is i should have obviously figured out that that was a stupid thing to say so me and
rags will probably never say that again because all of these are talking about how they shouldn't
send super chats i'm sorry for sending the super chat but hi rags hello some say they're still
streaming to this day oh some say what was that there it is here's that super chat you asked for

aiden explain a weed eater it's like like a weed whacker it's it's basically something
but we call those strimmers over here really strimmers i've never heard that we call them
these terminology because i don't know yeah man gotta figure out them languages they could be tough
i i go out and do some weed eating i don't know what you call do you call it streaming
then yes don't you do streaming okay streaming sounds like a very sterile sexual position
what's who's to say it's not that i literally have four days until i have to
to move to the uk so i'm i don't know any of these you said it was four days a day ago so
it's going to be three now it's three days now three days now because efap is oh god it's three

uh
why wings are the best bomber i don't just hi rags morning aiden and mola what's your
favorite adventure time character arc episode hello first off uh but i don't watch adventure time
let's go watch tv there oh shit i'm the only one here who watches seeing that show okay well
i mean is it too obvious that i just say jake he's amazing i love that character fantastic and
all the time with him basically rather than a particular episode i like all the earlier
seasons a lot i haven't seen a lot of the latest but i saw a lot of it as a whole i just like the
earlier please talk about adventure time more in efap well i'll make sure to try and
reference you know i'll save this question when jay comes on so that he can answer as well because
he's seen inventing likes you welsh androids dream of plastic sheep oh probably i was gonna
say it's pretty much you see i really not wales is a disgrace you should feel bad mules lee no
we did we did some stuff we we we gave you guys antony hopkins but yes by the way how
dare you fucking i will say this is a plastic sheep whatever fucking uh synthetic sheep uh
come here we'll rise again get the fuck out
um aden you've embarrassed yourself in the public space what are you going to do
my question yeah there you go uk time is one pm hi rags hello uk time is currently
246 pm so that was an hour and a half ago sort of down there rags maker mauler and j and pikeman
and cj or such play dnd and udm them call it massives and marauders force them
masses and marauders that's pretty good that's pretty good one day um
started fellowship at the beginning i'm now watching two towers you know as much as you
might find us being like wow that's how long we've been streaming that's nothing compared to
like all the people have been saying they've like lived whole days we'll think is watching
fellowship of the ring is starting two towers what's that like four hours
four hours isn't too if you'd said you completed the full trilogy i'd have been like fuck
uh aden if you had to be yes one race from the star trek universe which one would it be
also high rags uh waltkins 100 percent
i can't translate it but i'll go ahead and assume that that was well it's very okay it's very easy
so here's here's a really fun little tiny this is a sorry we're trying to wrap this up because
i'm tired as well a really really fun trivia piece though is that because the way that they
recorded the first words that are ever spake in vulcan they just had them record their lines in
english and then they dubbed over it in quote unquote vulcan so you know spread your fingers wide
and say live long and prosper and then say it's the same thing and such a death means peace and
long life and if you try to say such a death and peace in long life it's the exact same um mouth
movements yay well this is i did but i forgot another part i i forgot it's been a long fucking
night it's okay we're nearly at the end i think we're nearly made a guy like we're i see the sun
sunrise over there um i fell asleep waiting for you to start again i wake up and you're still
going you absolute massive also hi rags hello hi maula hi aden i forgot i actually told that
story earlier because i i very rarely do it's okay it's brain's melting is natural at this point i
think i can't remember everything it's impossible you've been to sleep twice so how do you trust
what's real anymore i'd say it's gonna be true um yes uh hi maula hi aden hi rags hello
guys are doing the lord's work bless you for doing this
when will you read all of the horrors heresy rags
oh i just don't have the time to read books
that is not that is not dead which can eternal lie with strange eons even death may die h
pilbo love cragons on at the streams of efap well that's nice greatly peace um 9 11 2
oh it says i don't know i guess the sequel
that's something else i got nothing plagues sexual interests is true horror
oh yeah absolutely plagues like gripes he's talking about and yes it is that's why i love
plague alright then plague is farm man and farm man very sad farm man is very sad
uh oh my god stop the madness

oh 24 hours before that you should bring on plague pat or woolly hell yeah
what are the who are those three people uh it's a reference to um uh it's two best friends play
the best friends um wales is a principality conquered by the english kingdom
all right well wales don't feel that way you ask the welsh people that you're not gonna get
people feeling as though that's that's but hey facts don't care about your feelings am i right
holy god you're still going i watched the first two hours went to work went to sleep and you're
still here yes hey big fan from india the dumb fine is only for landlords or homeowners in new
york city who state illegal alien as reason for denying accommodations okay so like it's not just
you don't it's a little bit more beyond just saying it um at least aden gave me an answer
for the red draggo but dragons are cool too i agree yeah dragons are cool for the dawn's
sake you're still going yes time stamp for when aden said she's getting a sig oh i guess that's
what that is brat you started as i was leaving work i passed out listening to you and my phone

oh is that me oh hello you brought me late enough at night and by now i mean the next day that
i actually have to bring out my ukulele to be annoying it's okay i'm not one of the people
who feels like they played out even though they kind of are a little bit they've made it into
loads of youtube videos and then they sort of stopped being in youtube videos for a while
like they're like the apology dog
for people like we can't have the apology dog anymore but maybe they're going to make a
resurgence here uh keep laying it on in on the furries this fandom needs a good slap
i guess he's referencing furries um yeah they slap him aren't jedi supposed to be in control
of their emotions i think the role is perfect for old wood faith
uh yeah but you could have characters who
yeah just got onto efab to see aden speaking japanese this just made my day made it the best
efab ever and earned my money hmm aden actually just went to smoke how many supers would you
need to go for a full 24 hours also high rags hello also anytime you want me to speak moon
i'm a pretty good translator at least okay i actually have jlpt2 cert so whatever good to
speak what jlpt2 means um near fluent japanese i don't speak it that well anymore but i did it one
point so so oh my god you guys are still on i fell asleep while you were laughing about flags
that feels like a lifetime ago oh it feels like it was years it really does that was a nice time
half life three is out and you're still going don't tempt me that way half life
stop bullying metal i'm at work and i can't defend him
i was here at the start i'll be here till the end i'm so used to listening to you i'm gonna feel
like i've lost a limb when you finally stop well there's plenty of backlog stuff you can get the
limb back temporarily what are your views on rhodesia no short answers only long
rags what's your opinion of rhodesia i don't know enough to formulate an opinion yet i'm sure it's
great though i have no idea what's referencing rhodesia is by far the best country ever
all right then you said no short answers but i assume that that is the long answer answer right
mine makes sense uh give this money to high rags oh hey take a nap you massives longer than the
anniversary stream what the fuck man it's not longer than that one okay stop that's no joker
sued my fellow game persons also hi aden that was a that was weekend warrior yes we all get to be
in cells soon enough when we watch the oh yeah we're excited for that one uh uh aden watches
your mom's house i sure do you guys like milk so have you ever tried kefir or bizani it's cultured
milk meaning it's fermented for probiotics it's pretty good i'm assuming it's more gross than that
because it was that's the super chef from eric stewart and he says some strange things sometimes
no i do not know of those milks i do like kefir though okay maybe it is a good it could be genuine
uh holy crap he's still going that's probably a stupid question for this podcast thank you so
much for having aden paladin on no problem she's been wonderful well i hope so i'm getting a little
drunk tonight i'm just playing my ukulele which is always annoying so it's funny it just that's how
i'm trying to not fall asleep so yeah we got it we're nearly there i swear it's like there's like 15
oh that's it oh yeah also kick rags no also hi j no no no no no no you've messed it all up high
maula 2 i guess okay fine thanks efap crew i've been on this treadmill for the last two hours
after working a 12 hour shift you guys make time fly hi rags hello that's yeah that's cool then
maula visas the super chats is the most devastating damage per second race i've ever seen
but i survived good day long man i'm in preliminary mode of producing a youtube
channel inspired by your work namely in similar editing style to your audio commentary videos
may i have your blessing to do so if so any advice uh i mean if not it's not like a patent
just yeah be careful about copyright and um good i don't know i don't know if you're doing
commentaries or if you're doing any kind of specific scripted work but like i like to say
usually if you're doing scripted work redraft research accuracy integrity consistency these
are all things the good stuff that'll lead you towards good results so good luck my good man
exactly he he he
please sir step away from the edge of that roof and that's that's from bizarro raw that's the one
that's trying to save people from rue uh all right what the actual heck are you doing i've
been to sleep twice fell asleep to super chats and wake up to edible discussions setting that

last no mr mauler i feel that i must apologize for you forcing you to read my thirst chats to rags
i'd read them myself but these restraining order against me makes this rather challenging
rags you took a restraining order against somebody being thirsty for you
i didn't do that i didn't i did not do that sound like you
but mauler x aden confirmed don't at me well this is just the fact you like
uh go to bed i just we got there i'm sure of it hello everyone hello aden gave a good answer

relatable they don't judge okay that's about it yeah even paladin if you if you look at things
in the world and you go wow that's weird i wonder why people are doing that thing well i'll go read
a thousand different pieces of published research and try to answer that question he will find the
answers that you would know not long as search for because of things that's the best way to say it
