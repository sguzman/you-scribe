streaming yeah context uh either of you guys ever heard of well any of i don't think fortier has
but um it all patrick willams no he's um from what i've heard he's someone who really loved the last
jedi who uh and so so that that's the kind of person we're dealing with huh wait this guy here
did yeah the one we're going to be responding to and what you'd have to why do you how do you think
you can try and justify saying just stop it you'd have to only a last jedi lover would be somebody
who makes a video about stop talking about plot holes but i was just i was just like oh
he loves the last jedi and he's made a video saying stop talking about plot holes like that's
that's gotta be pretty coincidental but he doesn't even he already brings it up for like a minor
point i think and the rest of it is like a bunch of other films that funnily enough me and wolf
watched a quiet place last night and we're refreshed on that film so yeah sadly i was
gonna say i need to get the url for my actual stream how do i how do i do that embarrassingly
try to figure this out are you doing it like stream now or events uh actually i got it we all
good i'm just gonna post it in my discord so that everyone knows just what the stuff's going on
rags out of curiosity have you seen the cyberpunk 2077 gameplay just a few just about a minute
worth or so yeah i've only got like 10 15 ish minutes i'm liking it so far but i want to see
more everyone wants to see more well everyone's wanted to see more for the past like eight years
when they first did that is that is true
what are we talking about right now don't worry precious people in chat you've not missed
anything just yet actually we're at the point where it would be great if you could just tell
me if if audio is is good wolf's a bit quiet is he on full oh he's not okay let's turn these people
up fix your damn sound you made me quiet last time too what is wrong with you well let's get
everyone tested for uh for these diseases i'm putting them up so so we'll do the gain if i need
to i'll just have to look at obs so you you are just under yellow which is should be fine rags say
something something all right you could go up a little bit somewhere say something controversial
something controversial oh you're way too quiet try again something controversial
yeah you're too quiet and i can't fix there's any way you can make yourself louder um like this
oh there's a fan right i'll i'll get i'll turn my fan off too i will roast i hope we have some
fans in here oh that's an excellent joke all right so that's done yeah we don't have fans
especially not me
yeah so for tsa one more thing one more thing i mean that should be okay
hey you guys able to hear everything sort of i hope so um i hope so too we should be okay
i'm sure the volume wise will be fine so i can just use that i'm sure that now they can
hear me can you hear me now everyone come on stop it rodo
i'm calling oh yeah they're already asking for jared videos
oh
what the fuck is the fourth guy see it's been so long since you've been on the street before
see they've forgotten who you are oh man this is the swedish one who likes to what's your thing
you like farm pigs or something uh and dragons farms dragons and pigs there you go that's his
thing that's what he does in his future which are more dangerous uh mice potholes don't mean crap
exactly educational so is everyone ready to see this incredible video all right everybody
we're watching victor i'm a renegade visual video no prepare to be demonetized wait what
oh man all audio for this video recorded with the sennheiser g4 wireless
microphone system so this is promotional then i guess neat fun
i already don't like it it's stylish we gotta talk about
plot holes used to be you know from that already i was like oh this is gonna be a popular channel
because he's got he's got the style thing that mark brown's got as well they just they know how
to present to make it look good whatever they're saying this thing that only existed in super nerdy
movie conversations like hey how did indiana joan survive claimed to the outside of that
why is it the it's super nerdy to discuss a film instead of it's like what should we be discussing
politics see how well that goes these days no that's 32 anything anything you just call
something nerdy and that means it's not okay to to talk about it it's the same um oh too quiet i'll
boost i'll boost it don't worry but uh yeah it's the same logic to me as um you know like you you
are too angry at this it's the same as like oh would you like to tell me how angry i should be
would you like to tell me what subjects i should talk about like to tell me mauler this has nothing
to do with the video but the chat on the the stream it's like off center like there there's
a lot being cut off on the actual screen that's just that's just a nitpick
oh well if that's your opinion that you're seeing that also everybody sorry i can't turn everybody
in the actual thing up by the way people you're gonna have to deal with with what we have but
according to ops i'm no louder than you guys or turn up your volume people pump up the value
yeah you guys need to use the volume booster thing that i got yeah you've got them on your computers
too it's your fault turn your knob on your computer box plot holes everywhere on this stream
please do a j nichols video we've been asked to cover here a couple times even in the um
uh the video yeah i know the the okay let's go back a bit see if this video has improved inside
subscribe used to be this thing that only existed in super nerd is that good enough folks or do you
need it to be louder because i mean if i go out just based my own you have the you have the
extension thing right yeah i know but i've i already boosted it so i'm hoping it's uh good enough oh
yeah and it should be it should be plenty more jared
much better okay good this this isn't jared genesis
this is his new video after he got subscribers he's like i gotta improve
he lost a lot of weight real quick his room is behind the paper there he bought shades as well
fades all right here we go the movie conversations like hey how did indiana joan survive clinging to
the outside of that submarine but over the past 15 years they've become pervasive spreading
through online movie conversations pervasive i wonder if it's because every movie now has
serious plot holes because writers suck at hollywood yeah i was gonna say it's almost
like people want to have the story be secondary to some kind of something else that they want
to push instead does anybody disagree that writing has gone downhill over time overall in general
because i i don't know about you guys but feel what we mean more for talking about it like this
year there's been a staggering amount of horrible movies that came out that were mainstream like
high budget sort of thing i can bring up that list again yeah and and it's gone to the point
where and i say this as a fan of the mcu infinity war is one of the best films for writing that came
out this year that's yeah okay here's all the movies all the bad movies that came out this year
ant man in the wasp black panther uh i haven't heard a whole lot of good about
incredibles 2 personally i haven't watched it oh i heard a lot of bad about that oh i think it was
average oh okay well we can ignore those two then black panther the meg uh venom has no chance in
hell of being good thoracic world fallen kingdom oceans eight uh a quiet place aquaman has no way
in hell of being good solo annihilation slender man ready player one um the predator has no way
of being good people are going to get angry that you said quiet place they shouldn't i'm going to
be making i'm going to be making another video about it because they're wrong for liking it
i liked it you can like things about it it's just like it makes me it makes me want to like well a
lot of people aren't like me they can't be like oh i could like it and it's also could be a bad
movie i was gonna say you can like it uprising be nice to the rampage tag wasn't a good movie
but i liked it transcendental argument for god what um anyway the the the thing you should take
away from what wolf just said is a hell of a lot of those uh reboots and sequels and their original
franchises have good writing as in the predator was was a well-constructed film it's probably not
going to be in its conclusion um then you've got the the drastic world comes from drastic park which
was way better now you got um oh yeah i i guess black panther doesn't really follow that formula
but it's it was still bad it was still this year but there's i'm sure there's plenty of good films
that did come out i'm talking about like high budget stuff this year has been quite shocking
like uh i don't know i don't know all of the years off by heart but yeah i would say that the
conversation about issues in writing might be becoming more prevalent because films are
starting to get really lazy and a lot of yeah writing is taking a backseat now yeah it's like
what molar said um infinity war and um fuck what was that best friends just came out oh mission
yeah mission impossible those are like the two best movies of the year
yeah i keep forgetting about best friends that was a good movie though
yeah it's just you know i'm not going to say any of this stuff without doing more research
definitively but the idea that plot holes is coming up as a subject it's like yeah that makes
sense to me oh sikario two yeah i completely forgot about that sikario one is a fucking glorious
film sikario two was like show up on the list it's a mess i fucking hated it because i love
the first one it's just sequel is man oh yeah what about porn movies
yeah no i can't get a definitive assessment of this i'm just trying to account for why
perhaps conversations of plot holes has come up more and more and i don't see how you don't talk
about that with a quiet place because it's just the whole film relies on its rules not being broken
isn't that the whole point like you you go in to watch it because you're like oh this looks cool
it's going to be a film where they have to be quiet and then they bring in all these extra things
that completely ruin that so it's like oh okay don't think about it i guess and again you can
like it and you can have fun with it but woof woof sound design yeah someone pointed out in the
chat it's just infinity war deadpool 2 mission impossible both of the best three movies and
best friends most of the four best movies best friends definitely the best need i need to see
more movies and then and then we can be sure about it we'll uh we'll keep it going everywhere
you turn people are complaining about biggest plot holes plot holes uh oh all the plot holes
plot holes i collected a montage of people saying the word plot hole yeah but are they wrong exactly
it's context it's like so neat yeah i can't wait for him to straw man every single one of these
people yeah i'm sure every single person in this and in that montage will have their arguments
addressed because he's got infinity wall there and i can actually name maybe not a plot hole but
inconsistencies in infinity wall myself so i wonder how many people these people were
valid or not you know never mind so full of plot holes that whole naruto platform so many
do you think do you think he avoided you on purpose i was i was sad that i didn't pop up
to be honest i was like come on come on there's what you know he was thinking you know he was
thinking it i mean i mean i'm in his comment section like people have meant for me oh god
oh god oh god we were in the open don't tell me mauler don't you dare tell me that he is going
to defend this piece of shit movie it's not just that he's going to defend it he's going to give an
just the argument he gives in defense of this film is why i wanted to respond to it is so funny i am
i'm going to be really mad in this video because i hate this i mean obviously you already know how
much i hate this movie because i was shitting on it the whole time we were watching it yesterday
i'm making another video on it just because of how much i hate it also just to clarify you guys
know just as well as i do right that there's more than you can criticize in a film more than just
plot holes but like they're a definite thing you can criticize like it's it's pretending like oh
that's all criticism is these days plot holes and it's like even in me and wolf's like drastic
world videos uh we point out plot holes sure but there's plenty of just like uh how do i categorize
retarded shit that happens throughout that entire movie yeah like an inconsistency that
don't actually have to be considered a strict plot hole i guess i should say yeah a lot of
the times those pop up in the form of character decisions yeah which he's actually going to cover
as well but then you know you get editing uh comments you get um like just just what would
you call it when they say you can get wrapped of blood from a t-rex that was just the most like
um can you now oh okay yeah and it's like you could not have assumed that we can accept it within
the home the film's rules of biology whatever but you could you could absolutely point out it was
just like wow that was convenient yeah not a plot hole convenient super super convenience and
which is basically the harry potter we we gotta keep a vore he's back and he said i love wolf
rags a ball of a fuck you for tea he didn't say it to me this time at least have him say
something before you and uh uh upgrade was good from frederick godzilla mentioned i've not seen
what's upgrades it's good no i don't even know who's new hey i'm guessing is it like a Liam Neeson
one or is this someone else at the helm i always assume it's Liam Neeson when you have a one weird
title for an action movie these days like they stole his handbag uh what was the last one he was
on a train that was a real crocodile handbag let me see and um Neeson the trans crocodiles don't grow
in trees i met Jenny Nicholson Jenny Nichols in person she's a tard a lot of people want me to to
um talk about here we can cover a video from here um eventually if you guys really want us to but
like yeah she's a little bit overrated for as far as i'm concerned then we've got um that sad face
made me feel bad i take it back for two but thank you all for donations and we will um try and read
them out in the sort of like spaces between trying to respond to the video guys we'll never get through
it and um yes all right here we go defensive no the commuter that's what it was oh the commute yeah
a quiet place opened my twitter and facebook feeds were filled with people complaining about
all the plot holes i saw one guy say he'd made a list of 41 plot holes in that movie 41 that's
weak sauce me and nowhere near as many as there are yeah me and wolf there was barely a second
to stop talking about the conflicting rules of the characters making decisions that are so
ridiculous but uh fair enough 41 is a good good good attempt it's a lot it is indicative of a
trend no one seems to actually know what a plot hole is all right all right stop we'll go with
who wants to go first and define what a hole is without looking online what is a plot hole look
look here you're being headed fuck a plot hole is when shit doesn't make any goddamn sense and
it's completely inconsistent with the story it's trying to tell i know you like to pretend like
you're intelligent however you're not i love the uh the assumption that you know like you open
an argument and you just go you guys don't know the definitions of words so i've already won but
let's dismantle the argument anyway it's just like oh that was cheap but okay i think you didn't need
to say that um if i was if i yeah i was gonna tell somebody what a plot hole is to be simple
and brief i would say that it's a story being inconsistent with its own rules uh but for me
it's when i would say it's i think i go through it in my tlj things i actually wanted to make sure
i pulled up the definition is something like when when something's established no so when
a character knows something when they have no reference for it or when they don't know something
when they did have a reference for it is one of the most like baseline plot holes uh you can get
or yeah it's basically something happening when the the rules of the universe have told you that
it can't happen it's just like a base contradiction but a base contradiction will be a good way to say
it a contradiction within an established um character or rule of the universe or the lore
and this is the thing uh if we had a scene in star wars where there were no sounds from the
explosions and stuff we would be like huh weird they always usually have sounds but it would be
if you called that a plot hole it'd be like well i i suppose it's an inconsistency but it doesn't
matter whatsoever but then if you have it doesn't affect the plot unless somebody is saying oh i
can't hear it so therefore i can take this action yeah but then if you have a character like fin
saying they tracked us through light speed that's impossible and then a scene later says i know about
the hyperspace tracker i mopped outside it it's like wait yeah that is a plot hole so he should
have warned them all that they had a tracker because he knew that would have changed the plot
is it consist inconsistency within the plot line i mean that's putting it as simple as it is
yeah that's probably uh where it comes from as a definition i suppose yeah i can't wait you have
to follow it if you set something up you have to obey it we're gonna i can't wait to hear his
explanation of what a plot hole is it's probably us no if he contradicts anything we've said i'd
be surprised i'm pretty sure he goes with the standard and all those plot holes people complain
oh god it black and white close up black and white they don't matter hey man it's a style
leave him alone they don't actually matter so whoa is a plot hole his hairline's gone
back even more than mine with the cap on buddy oh that's so mean you can make fun of somebody's
balding this i mean you can but i was just gonna say like they don't matter it's like all right
let's make sure we remember that he's just said they don't matter so if he brings up at any point
in any way that they can matter or are valid just just just keep that in mind people's definitions
vary but here's the generally accepted one i love that he says they vary a definition after
saying people don't know the definition nice nice job that i use a plot hole and he defines this
one as the one he uses rather than the one from the dictionaries like come on try hard there's a
point in which a story breaks a previously established rule about its own universe there
you go basically it's when a story contradicts itself there you go okay so here's what are not
plot holes so um
i don't want to do it anymore something that happens off screen so let me be a plot hole
that yeah i know let me let me just give you an example that's not in this video and just
not even in a film you just have a character who's like five foot tall and then two scenes
later you see him and he's just seven foot tall and you're like what the hell and then
someone goes he could have had surgery between then to lengthen his legs
or when you if you have a crippled character right and they have to get somewhere and after
a scene transition they're there with everyone else it's like how did you get here is it like
oh i learned how to no my legs healed and then they broke again
is a the thing is that i ran so fast that my legs just broke again yeah my legs were unused
to the effort of walking and so they broke i flew too close to the proverbial sun what we're
learning here is that it matters about context it's not as simple as something happens off screen
is not a plot hole it matters what the context is yeah the thing he's gonna do is he's going to
say something along the lines of like it happened off just because he didn't show it doesn't mean
it's a plot hole he's gonna apply it to something that way we can conveniently explain it away he
applies it to the writing the movies for us no he doesn't even do that he goes for the simplest
possible one that no one would ever disagree with i'll let you see it in the dark night rises oh
wait this guy's going to raise an actual one and he's going to bat it down and then he's going to
compare it to one that it's not the same as whatsoever we never see how batman gets back to
gotham city yeah that's an actual issue yeah so just to cover that quickly because i actually
watched the film i watched it recently with um a friend of mine called metal because we were
invested in seeing if it was as bad as we remember and i still think that dark night rises is pretty
awful and that is a major one bruce wayne is bankrupt and he's stored in some distant hole
in the ground in some foreign country he gets to the top of it and then the next time we see him
he's like healthy and ready to fight as batman in gotham and you're like wait and it's only like a
day later why how can you possibly listen to that because it happened off screen it happened off
screen he found he found a jet that was abandoned and he flew he found an abandoned jet and he flew
in the jet and then he got back to the city with he used to parachute no no it's in the
see i can explain it away and it doesn't break the laws of physics it's in the novelization you
guys just refuse to read because you're idiots yeah but it's in the dc universe so so superman
obviously picked him up and dropped him off in gotham that's true yeah you don't you don't get
to being uh you don't get to be in bruce wayne without making a few connections i'm gonna call
in a few favors so yeah that that one's an actual one and look at the one that he references as an
example of how it can happen off screen guys don't complain one of the earliest cinematic
developments was the concept of montage the idea is that when two images are presented in sequence
the audience understands that they occur chronologically and will mentally fill in the time
between scenes so for instance if a person is in one location and the next scene they're in
another location we understand that in between scenes they traveled between the location
so guys wow this this guy's a fucking idiot it is so like yes yes we understand that
mauler can you can you answer me a question okay because i'm really afraid to know the answer but
i feel like i have to why is he in an alley well that is a question but i assume that he walked
there in between scenes my question was going to be um has he does he have uh nine thousand
dollars of patreon and he only makes one video a month i don't think he's as bad as mark brown
i don't know i think he's kind of worse oh i mean what i meant is i don't think he makes as much
money so it's not as terrible in terms of content but but i don't i don't i don't actually know if he
even has patreon i don't really know much about him it's no big either matter that's fucking
retarded what he just said regardless yeah i was gonna say do you guys even need us to explain why
what he just said is a complete false equivalency it's like saying you know someone kicking you in
the foot is the same as someone slamming a fucking sledgehammer on it yeah basically you
can explain anything away you can say meanwhile at this location somebody that we just saw somewhere
else is now here as this thing came out today okay as they're saying in chat it's about context
it's always about context you can't just say stuff can happen off screen guys go away next point
it's like oh every example is an individual all they needed to do in the dark knight rises by the
way was just have bruce find a contact in a foreign country that he knew from his days as a
training at blah blah blah it would be convenient but then it wouldn't be a plot hole
and then you get people being like how do you know that didn't happen
oh my god i'm one of the comments like i need to i need a jeep in africa let me call up one of my
old war buddies who owes me a favor okay i guess well as as the famed bilbo baggins once said it's
about context precious context that was right after bilbo defeated voldemort you know on the
ridge of casa doom right so there is there is a friend of mine in there's a friend of mine in
chatties who i asked to sort of try and advocate for the video as best you can and he did say
uh would knowing how bruce went got there however simple would that have improved the movie
yes i think that uh you could have just applied to any that part of the movie at least i was
gonna say it does it necessarily have to improve it to be uh pulled an actual law as in because
this is the thing that people point out right is like is it a contradiction or is it simply
a lack of information in which there could actually be an explanation um well they have
to show that explanation because otherwise it doesn't make any goddamn sense well i was gonna
say it ruins the stakes because now he can teleport and generate resources as far as we can
assume so uh it's unnecessary breach of of of uh what would you call it like an investment from
many many viewers when all you need to do is a line a throwaway line at worst because um he
followed up saying wouldn't it be a bit tedious to have an explanation like that in the climax
well you don't have to make it long you can literally have a scene where bruce uh walks
into some kind of bizarre or wherever is near the place he was in because it looked very distant
from civilization and then you find a way he gets a phone then he calls alfred or then he
calls someone he knows gets a pickup and that's it and you know the person on the phone could be
like what do you need and then he's like we're gonna need a uh and he says a bunch of numbers
so it implies that this is a thing he had set up you just be like oh okay one minute at most
instead we watch him poof into gotham and we're like what and that's the thing gotham's on
lockdown as well you remember like nobody in or out aside from resources across the bridge so
it's just like oh okay no he was able to get into gotham look perfectly fine and he was able to make
that big stupid burning bat symbol yeah it's a bit much i'd say to to go into and then objectively
speaking is absolutely a gap whether or not it'll affect people's enjoyment i guess we're living
proof that that actually happened but it's obviously a possibility i guess but anyway
we will let him continue movies tend to assume that the audience is reasonably intelligent
but i guess they're wrong if movies showed us every single second that happened during the
span of the story they would be 40 hours long and yeah people didn't ask you to show every single
second yeah nobody's asked a complete straw man yeah no one's asking for that yeah just just find
one person on the planet so they wanted to watch bruce wayne take every step from that hole back
to gotham just find me that person yeah if he locates a car we assume he can drive you know how
about we look at all the movies let's look at all the movies out there that don't have plot holes
that aren't 40 hours long oh but you know all of them because there's no movie that's 40 hours long
oh some of them feel like it though
you mean like this video character does something you wouldn't do here we go here we go this character
does something you wouldn't do so to give you some context on this because i know where he's going
with it uh just right actually tweeted out after it was a few days after the debate me and wolf had
with him said something along the lines of it was either him or hello grito but they said um so
annoying that people basically look at holdo's actions and they criticize it as like sort of
something nobody would ever do when it's actually something they wouldn't do and that she's a
character and she can make her own decisions when they don't accept that um all they're complaining
about is that they wouldn't have made the decision which is like wow you know like like that's the
justification you have to come up with to be able to sort of let the story run when you can just
find the contradiction like i did with just right where it's like would you agree that holdo puts
the the lives of the resistance above anything else and most people will say yes because why
the fuck wouldn't she and you'd be like so why did she let poe almost kill everybody instead of
just telling him the plan like well she had she had a moment of insanity yeah that's what you have
to go with she's stupid okay and you don't accept that people can make stupid decisions which is
actually going to be the argument he makes you i am axing you did he have a moment of weakness
the first legendary debate Disney fanatical star wars fan Disney fanatical universe i remember
being like what does that mean yeah i was like what are you talking about and this is the other
thing by the way out of care you know when you have an episode of the Simpsons where Homer does
something stupid you don't go i would never have done that it's like oh no Homer is stupid that's
his whole thing that's he's a stereotype of the stupid American that's supposed to be the joke
just like every you know all of them are stereotypes in the Simpsons and yet Appuz is the only one
that's offensive apparently but you you then fast forward to something like holdo and it's got no
establishment of being stupid or petty or idiotic and yet she is and so you're just like okay the
audience feels a little bit confused about that one how is he saying convenient is he saying that
every person who who's implying that this is a plot hole wants a movie to be all the same characters
well that yeah kind of like but like 10 of them he's saying that we're saying that we want these
characters that behave as we would yeah so everyone would behave as we do and therefore
they would all have in our 40 hour movies everyone needs to behave exactly like we do
that's the movie that we're advocating for this is like no i i just advocate for characters that
aren't retarded that's all i want is like characters that can think for themselves so i don't have to
think for them yeah characters can make reasonable mistakes that it doesn't mean that you have to
basically resort to this character had a moment of of complete random insanity and that's totally
not a plot hole that's what the guy argued with me wolf he was like hux was arrogant and stupid
that's why he fired on nobody instead of everybody it's like okay he called him a boy don't you see
how offensive that is and then he had to double back because we were like why isn't he arrogantly
chasing them later that he's like well wait was that after when snoke spoke to him like yes that
was after he was like was that after the scene that i just completely made up all right have a look
there are so many plot holes in a quiet place oh it's such a great movie i mean like why did they
decide to have a baby okay see exactly did you catch the follow a bit oh such a great movie
because they're they're implying that the person who points out the plot hole says you're not
allowed to like it which fun enough you did do earlier i'm gonna assume hyperbolically we allow
people to like whatever they want it was hyperbolic but i don't think it's a well no i know for a
fact it's not a good movie but you know that's the thing the plot holes still exist i like a quiet
place but i recognize that there are some serious problems with the movie but you can still like
the movie absolutely there's nothing wrong with liking the movie i like that i like a quiet place
i enjoyed that movie but it has problems high five so let's see what he's well this is gonna
be difficult for human i'm sorry and why didn't they just move to the waterfall this is the one
movies are for the most part about human beings are at least characters who think and act like
human beings the quietness is about human beings that's why we're all fucking retarded hey man
let him let him make his incredibly good argument and then we can just have an argument why
why are you recording this on a busy street i don't know it's style style style style
this isn't a substantive criticism this is a question about a style question you have like
a nice quiet studio and i mean like isn't it it's like hot in august people find it cool you're
you're just nitpicking you're nitpicking and you're being rude okay i'm not saying he's wrong
for i'm not saying he's wrong for it even though the even though even though the tag on the pipe
says my name i'm not saying he's wrong all i'm saying is that i i don't really get what he's
going for the alley shots and you go for street cred i assume it's supposed to feel flashy and
back and forth and interesting like it keeps you into you know this is a bit like a ghd it's just
like boom boom boom boom boom oh the pipe does say your name part about human beings are at least
characters who think and act like human beings and you know what human beings are not logical
people are yes but on average on average human beings are not fucking retarded okay and their
entire characters don't shift in an instant you know i'm sorry maybe i don't want to be following
a bunch of idiots that don't know what they're doing in this movie i'm supposed to be taking
seriously maybe if this was scary movie four where you're supposedly following a point i was
about to say that's a good point the scary movie these stupid things happen because the characters
are stupid because they're parodying bad horror movies where people are just stupid for no reason
i mean they parody good horror movies as well i'm not saying they don't but the problem is
the statement humans are always logical and humans are never logical at both just stupid don't make
when did we ever yeah there's a way to have characters make reasonable mistakes
or to maybe make a bad call but you can almost always justify it because people generally
do things for reasons yeah even if it's a wrong move even if it's maybe a a taking a different
path right people have reasons for the things that they do they don't humans don't really behave
completely randomly what's a great thing you can use that as an a complete and total excuse for
anything that a character does the in basically the insanity defense your honor my client pleads
temporary insanity and that's what they do with plenty of characters when they they make either
contradictive or downright retard decisions that you just sit in there like how could they possibly
have thought this and the way to make a flawed character is to have a consistent sort of core
right where where the best one i can think of the top my head is just tie-win Lannister's
whole deal is pride feels pride in everything that he does so it motivates him to push everything
for his family forward in his image and it pushes him to the point where he's super successful gets
super powerful but it kills him is the point his pride he doesn't actually he's not concerned with
the idea i don't want to spoil it i was about to say a bunch of things and i was like wait there
are probably some people haven't seen season four of game of thrones so what i'm saying is when
characters make an error it's usually related to something that uh i suppose is a huge part of
their character you could actually apply it to seriously as well she never would have thought
that what she rose somebody to power as a plan for herself in game of thrones and then she
ultimately uh again i don't want to spoil it do you follow what i'm saying i'm trying to fight
another example like uh within you know anakin search for power to save people ultimately
overreaches and fucking makes the mistake of doing a bunch of things that that are just just
just outright wrong but motivated by a decision for power though killing the kids seems a little
bit too far i need i need to find some more examples just just characters can do stupid
stuff as long as it's implied that they um they think it's the right decision or they have a blind
spot i think that's the way i was looking for established blind spot iron man's ego absolutely
uh you know cap would have an inability to trust that he needs to i don't know i was gonna say
like he he could never see um wrong in bucky for example establishment i guess yeah like captain
america almost dies to bucky because he would never he just doesn't believe that it should
essentially stop him because he's just that invested in him and that could have resulted in
dying so these people who are reacting to you saying anakin killing kids is a little too far
okay majorly too far i was i was being hyperbolic or what's the opposite of kidding
he just goes to other places on the planet so it's killing the kids they just like these aren't even
jedi dude oh no he needs to put them in labor camps and gas chambers yeah that's too far yeah
the kids probably died too quickly oh there you go exactly quill too merciful quill's reactions
in gardens the galaxy 2 and infinity war they're all motivated by him being incredibly emotionally
attached to uh people to the point of absolutely ridiculous over reactions established and and
the film puts it at least puts effort into say like if there's going to be something he does
that's gonna gonna fuck things up that other characters wouldn't do it'll be related to these
people these important people or how emotional is what i'm trying to say is he's gonna bring in
the fact that they don't go to the river in a quiet place as a human error it's a logical
error that someone can make which if you've seen the film they live there for what like two years
right next to the river they tell us in the film that the river is a safe place you can scream while
at the river i'd live there i'd live there i that seems like the right thing to do and they don't
in the film even remotely try and explain all they needed to do is have a kid say um dad why don't
we live here and then the dad is like you can't make anything that lasts long near a river or
something like you can't build on a river but then i was just gonna say you could just argue
they could dig they could they could do anything there's plenty they could do just because they
could make so much noise next to a river yeah why not live down in that safe room i mean that's just
i mean if the if the if your if your family's at risk
and if you're in constant danger all the time living in fear why the fuck are you not down
in that room with for your cooking and your cleaning and your your leisure and your spelling
why are you not always down there oh see okay so um first thing is that we see them in the film
build the soundproof room only once the baby's coming along which is retarded you'd build that
well before because first thing you fucking do so yeah so they have intuition they have creativity
they don't choose to live at the river so that's one thing and then someone in chat just said
because then you'd have no movie that's a lack of creativity if you can't make a movie out of a film
with his monsters everywhere that react to hearing things and you've put your i'd say it makes sense
to put your base of operations at the river and then they need to go out for reasons and that's
what puts them in trouble or you just don't have the fucking waterfall you just don't have
the waterfall that's a good point yeah that did that scene have to exist does it ever come up i
can't forget does it ever come up again do they ever use it as wolf pointed out uh when we watching
it he's like they get oh that's when they establish that louder sounds cover up softer sounds and you
need a waterfall for that is though we even needed to have that explained to us in the first place
yeah as if even a child doesn't know that and there's so many things they don't explain
so they have stand everywhere implying that there's some kind of place they're getting
sand from and if we it brings up the question of wait so typically you get sand from a beach and
it's like can you live on the water can these things get to you in the water what do they do
with water what happens can you because water's pretty noisy i don't know if do they go after
fish do they eat fish they kill fit and you couldn't you'd be like oh that's exploring too
much like okay fine but um stop letting us know that these are options yeah it's just confusing
but if your defense is you're thinking too much stop makes sense it's like those zombie movies
right where you're like i was the kid and i'd be like why doesn't everybody live on a houseboat
like on the lake and they're safe all the time the argument could be that you know you'll run
out of resources eventually and you need a more consistent whatever there's things you can do is
is kind of what i would argue for you can make stuff up you can be like oh the boat is falling
apart or it's running out of electricity or the motor brakes and it's like we have to go to land
that could be the film they have to go to land that could be interesting like you know you don't
have to they put themselves in this position and people are like but if you get rid of if you
recognize the river then you have no movie it's like that's their fault why are you saying that
like it's inevitable they actually say themselves that they can't hear them under the river when
you could have just said yeah the river doesn't doesn't protect you there's a different frequency
of sound the river doesn't stop them from hearing you it's an in-house rule and you could be like
okay fine yeah like for whatever reason you don't even have to explain they could hypothesize about
it well these things know what a river sounds like they know that it's not something they can kill
or eat so they filter it out or something something like that yes uh he's arguing that hey humans make
mistakes and for me it's just like that's anything yeah i was gonna say what what can someone do in
a film that you can't just justify with that excuse is there ever a time where a character
does something that you think is dumb mr what's his name patrick willams i just curious i forgot
we were watching a video like you know if someone's just walking around having a normal day that
shoots themselves in the head the family doesn't even care they don't even notice and there's blood
everywhere you know some people sometimes people just do weird things yeah you just i'd be like is
that fair that he's like that's an extreme and i'd be like oh so there's a scale there is a scale
there's a line drawn just to clarify they make choices based on emotion not everyone thinks
exactly the same and also what exactly would the choice have been to not go to the river that was
emotional because um they're lazy because the mother had a traumatic experience involving a
waterfall as a child oh god and so she has waterfall phobia we're emotionally retarded
you see that's weird because i have i have this phobia of monsters that want to kill me so that's
my emotional reason for being by the waterfall all the time imagine that in the film they're like
the kid points out should we live the river it's like your mother doesn't like water
okay she she can stay at home then we'll stay here yeah i'll be here waterfalls killed by far
why aren't we just fucking camping here like we have all the gear we could ever need and then some
gamer of rock is right i think this falls under jared response theory i have to categorize it
not making a lot of no even jared was like that the purple haired bitch was like what the fuck
even jared recognized that the purple haired bitch didn't make any sense
people make mistakes here it's on a different point
vulcans live dominated by logic and it's established that acting logically is at odds
with acting human so if everyone that's not did you seriously just justify that acting logical
is actually opposing to acting human it's not acting logical alone it's acting only logical
only logical yes that's less than human because humans are inherently emotional beings
that doesn't mean we never act logically come on
like man they're the opposite okay human and logical two different things he makes an argument
in this fucking video that he's using this microphone system right now because it's good
and he needed one because he wanted to be on the move so like that sounds like a logical decision
i think and you don't get castigated in vulcan society for um it's when people make enough
you for being too human it's because you're emotional not illogical you can do illogical
things and people don't say ha ha you're human someone in the chat said that he's evolved as
a critic oh no oh my this is i can't believe he cites star trek to prove that acting in logical
ways means you're not human it's like what are you doing you're acting totally logically all the
time only making the most logical decision in any situation no one would be acting human yeah if
you acted logically 100 of the time that would be an issue but again this is not what's happening
this is like the 40 hour movie and this is like the characters behaving as we want them to
this is a complete straw man that's like people aren't saying that characters have to be robots
that's not what we're asking for there are plenty of things they do in the film for example the
firework system to distract them it's like oh that makes some sense yeah i can see that i can
see doing that i mean that's yeah and then he could be like no that was an emotional decision
they just really like fireworks it has nothing to do with the actual logic of you know distracting
the enemies i'd be like oh lucky it had that effect i suppose yeah that's that's convenient
that they had that emotion at that exact time they needed to have it well i had the firework
emotion just when we needed a distraction how close good thing we're not perfect or else this
would be an issue with the plot there would be no conflict which would lead to no drama which would
lead to no stories and movies would be really interesting how he just said there would be no
stories when he established that the vulcans are like fully logical and they have plenty of stories
and drama in star trek but uh sure because do you guys think you could write a story um out of a set
of beings that are only logical yes i think i could absolutely because you could have two opposing
forces that are being exactly that's it from their point of view you have two logical conflicting
ideas easy dude it's game of thrones yeah every everybody can be out for themselves and be
internally consistent but they can also be opposed to other people and that can create drama
conflict is yeah no he's you know think he slammed the kibosh on it guys it's only boring if you do
logical things done you know i think i think he only hates logical things because he's inherently
illogical himself maybe well it's just like he can't argue against them and so he has to completely
try well he's he's great at attacking these points no one's making yeah he's he's creating insane
people to fight against and for some reason his comment section's eating it up like it's just the
truth like i said i'm referenced in there is one of the people that does this shit it's like when
have i ever said that you should always act logical 100 of the time it's like what who even says that
and think if somebody asked me um i think it was late last week that they were writing a story and
the way that they were writing a story all the characters kind of ended up being sort of the
same and they asked what they could do to kind of change that and the first thing i said was
um have their backgrounds be different so that they are led to their own different conclusions
about things and it works just like this people don't have to be illogical for them to be
to them to take branching paths and it's it's such a it's a really interesting topic to be
honest how logic intertwines with emotion but he's just made it so boring and simple like
logically why it's just like this is this this is this go it's like oh isn't that the whole
baseline of Thanos what like his thinking is technically logical but it's completely off
in comparison to all of the heroes it's um it's motivated emotionally but it's a logical decision
you could argue this is what i mean by it being really interesting it's a logical decision because
he has proof right his planet yeah was dying he said that it was dying and then it eventually
died but then key lines of dialogue like when he says um i won't when he's talking about sacrificing
Gamori's like i won't let um i won't stand i won't let something stand in my way again it's
like he's he's clearly angry about the fact that he couldn't do it the first time yeah and it's not
like anyone's making the argument that his solution wouldn't work yeah exactly because
it's a logical decision only it's a different logical compared to the hero's logical yes and
that's yeah that's the that's the the conflict of logical ideas that can happen but apparently
that's just boring and um so just to clarify for viewers and for us a plot contrivance so
like a convenience or inconvenience it's like watch the force awakens you'll know what that is
it's like everything works out for you or whenever something needs to happen plot wise
the unlucky or lucky thing happened yeah um yeah i wouldn't categorize them as a plot hole i
would categorize them as a contrivance or a convenience yeah it's not like it can't happen
it's just insane coincidences that when the stars just happen to line up and as far as i'm
concerned you can have them just bloody hell try not to have 100 that all lead up to the
biggest payoffs like have them really early on like for example a story can start with a great
um uh with a great coincidence someone's thrust into some kind of scenario but that doesn't mean
that every single thing has to happen because star wars r2d2 ends up bumping into luke skywalker
that's the that's the coincidence that starts the whole film off but it's not too bad because
it's one of it has to bump into somebody yeah and it's and that's the thing it's fine because
it's right at the beginning and the rest of the story is is where it works to have payoffs that
everything has to happen just because of how characters are motivated but that's the thing
it's fine with me to have a couple but like it depends on what they do for example we need to
open this door i i'll shoot it and then it opens and you're like wow like that was lucky instead
of like the million other things that could happen and it turns out that door behind it has
the exact thing they need you know and you just be like yeah that takes me out of the film whenever
somebody punches the keypad and because they don't know the code and it opens up the door stuff like
that yeah it's convenient that's what happens when you punch it that's how doors would be designed
but all right it seems like a counterproductive security measure to me okay let's uh let's see
his assessment of plot contrivance it there is a huge plot hole in star wars i mean come on
why would the death star has such an obvious design flaw uh i was actually talking to footy
about this few well like half hour ago but um it's a bit weird to say that it's like a contrivance
or convenience that there's this hole that they can fire a missile down to destroy the entire
death star when they're holding the blueprint for it so they have literally every piece of
information about the death star so it's logical that they would find you know like i use this
analogy with foot here so you look at a car and it's like destroy this thing uh with just you
know a lighter like within five seconds if someone who's never seen a car before he'd be like uh
i don't know um but then if you take somebody who actually knows what a car is and knows the
blueprints they can immediately go to the um you know where you connect one wire well you can do
that i was gonna say you could you could open the um the gas tank thing just throw the lighter in
yeah and then boom and it's like oh that's pretty convenient way to be able to destroy the car it's
like well i mean i guess it is like you know how a car works you know that all i had to do is
disconnect a spark plug and it won't start and all i had to do was just cut one wire and it's not
the idea is machines tend to have big weaknesses that you'd know if you were the one who made it or
i.e the one who had the blueprint and let's remember every single ship in the fleet gets
destroyed outside of luke's they missed the first shot and he has to use the force to be able to
nail it like it's not easy it's not something that just yeah it's not like they just flew there on
holiday and blew it up so yeah to me you could say i i think i'd be happy to say it's it's slightly
convenient but it's it's not it's not a significant convenience that has no basis in reality it's like
come on it wasn't convenient for them when they were doing it we certainly not it would have been
way better if it was as simple as oh yeah we could just find a remote controlled rocket right in there
from wherever we are who'd be like wow that's useful um yeah as someone just said in chat it's
like wow how convenient this car just happens to be filled with the liquid that makes it explode
it's like
also we're on a rift now yes yes we are okay some of these can be valid complaints
some did you catch that not that one though yeah but
telling you who can have a valid complaint or not remember he said at the beginning that these
things don't matter that he said oh that's a valid complaint it's like wait can you remember
you just tell me which ones are which because you know are they are not the might may be valid or
not the mighty patrick williams they're valid depending on what movies he subjectively likes
exactly this is something you should be able to pick up pretty quickly is that he's raging
against all of the people in the world who said that they you know they didn't like a movie because
of x plot hole and then he's just like saying that's stupid but then there's gonna be a time
where he watches a movie it doesn't like it and then someone says why didn't you like it and he
goes i don't know it didn't really make sense that this thing happened it didn't really make
sense that we can just go that's just a plot hole why'd you care yeah just shut up about plot holes
shut up about plot holes don't think don't think about stories there's no reason to write good
stories there's no reason to have consistent lore there's no reason to have uh you know to
put all this work into making everything make sense there's there's no reason why bother just
to have some nonsensical story with flashy graphics that's why you can't stand people like
this because every time they're like oh just ignore everything wrong with it don't think
that just spits in the face of every single good story ever written dude because if you can just
make everything good just by ignoring everything bad then what's the point of ever making something
good i don't want that yeah like i don't want people to have that yeah we don't we don't want
that i don't want to i don't want to say oh yeah that video you made i did it's it's fine i just
ignored all the bad shit yes uh so the problem for me fundamentally about now this video is he's
contradict himself permanently so at least we could assume that he's saying there's never any
problems with anything and you could be like that's a retarded position but fine at least he's
consistent but now he's just said there are such things as valid plot holes but now we know that
he has a scale and since ours is based on literal just evidence of contradiction that's all we
require his is based on it's about whether or not i feel that it is like okay someone in the chat
said just ignore the holocaust jesus yeah i agree that'll work i perfectly agree holocaust didn't
happen foxdream donates and stop this stream about this hack and go to jared um some bassist
batteries said guys please watch the cyberpunk 27 7 gameplay demo show your thoughts they did
actually uh stay a bit at the beginning of the stream if you can still cycle back you'd be able
to hear a bit we haven't watched enough it looks fun to me at least from like the 15 minutes i've
actually seen yeah but i want to watch more of it before i can formulate a full opinion on it
the one versus zero i ai debate when humanity develops ai eventually an equation where
happen where one is safe humanity zero destroy is going to occur i'm assuming that's to do with
how to make logical dramatic stories which again yeah especially if you bring in artificial
intelligence it starts to get really interesting but no it's all boring and um sometimes there's
a story development that's a little too convenient like in the 2009 star trek kirk just happens to
get stranded on the same planet as old spock and they end up in the same cave together so spock can
explain what's going on i like the movie but that's a little contrived and lazy i'm glad we
got that far that's good okay thumbs up but it's not a plot hole who the fuck said a contrivance
or convenience is a plot hole anyway i don't know whatever he's just making who is he talking to
i want to meet these people who think that conveniences have to be plot holes who want
these 40 hour movies i want to meet these crazy people out there ask them questions i
really want to really want to poke their brains a bit so you guys are going to love this one
i mean how does vinicio del toro know the rebels plans nobody told him that's a plot hole oh now
uh funnily enough er brought that up in his criticism the last jedi and actually sent him
a pm saying um but he was there twice when he listens to them explain the plan that's not
actually a plot hole and he said yeah i missed that and i was like oh fair enough
simple as that all right um and this thing happens it's called making a mistake
in criticism it's not something that like means that your entire criticism is now wrong
it means that that particular one would be inaccurate which is
molly you were telling me about you mentioned something in infinity war you called
oh yeah dr strange's home sanctum sanctorum or something i called it camatage when it was
sanctorum yeah and that's a thing that's a genuine mistake but it didn't affect my arguments whatsoever
that's a plot hole
everything you say from now on it's irrelevant you can't be taken seriously anywhere from youtube
and uh yeah that i've absolutely made these mistakes on my channel too um you just need
to really make sure that you get the dialogue down you know you get you get the scenes down
and it's like he's gonna explain the the answer now but i gotta follow up for this 50 of the plot
holes that i see people complain about are things that are actually explained in the movie if you
just pay attention like that one in the last jedi there's a scene where you see dj listening as
po tells spin and rose there is so the interesting part of what he said was 50 of the plot holes i
see online or explained in the movie and it's like 50 percent it's an exterior exact perfectly
in the middle okay like i'm sure he's just being hyperbolic but wow wow that's wow i yeah yeah
let's go over them um ben's just pointed out another one i said that um uh three p.o's arm
is red in tfa but then it's just not in the last jedi but it's actually replaced in tfa i just
didn't notice i missed it it's actually a plot hole with tfa and but the thing is it's like did
i make any big arguments about it aside from saying that they gave him a red arm to make him
yeah just a side note but i guess it's a sentence and it's one sentence in a five-hour video
and i and if someone was like you made that mistake did you admit it i'd be like mhm
and they're like your video is wrong so now the 99.5 of the rest of the film that i made about
film let's let's talk about that which obviously he's not going to talk about that too he only
picked one of the most commonly made mistakes because there's a couple of people who made this
mistake but again the last jedi is not exactly lacking mistakes beyond this one you can pick out
a few thousand more you just pay attention like that one in the last jedi there's a scene where
you see dj listening as po tells spin and rose the resistance's plan but i guess if you're too
busy live tweeting about plot holes you can miss some stuff if you want implying by the way that
there are actual plot holes to find and that they missed the ones that were there are made up ones
because they missed them and i'm just sitting here thinking like i thought we were supposed to shut
up about plot holes it doesn't matter whether or not you find ones that are there or not that are
actually accurate or not you should just shut up in general isn't that the point of this video it's
like it's such a scummy thing to do when you try and frame like people mischaracterizing this
if you take a film like the last jedi which has so many plot holes and say oh yeah well this one
that people cite is wrong he's like okay but the other 600 are we just not going to talk about
those exactly are they just they do are they not around do they not exist anymore because
somebody that i've never heard of this plot hole by the way i've actually never heard this one
but if somebody's making this one yeah they're wrong so does that mean there are no plot holes
in the film i was going to say i'm pretty sure er's videos an hour and a half he makes that one
point like are we going to address the rest or are we just going to say yeah er if you're paying
more attention rather than looking for plot holes maybe you'd have better criticism
um speaking of er i've seen like 50 people say get er in here you guys got to understand
it is unbelievably difficult to get into contact with er we would have him here immediately if
we could but he's not i would have had him on my podcast forever ago if i had the chance
this is i only just got him to actually get on twitter or at least look at twitter because i
bought um the full fuck what was it death note manga today and i just tweeted about it and he
retweeted it and i was like oh he's online he's here otherwise it's like it's infamously difficult
to get in contact with him yeah he's not like me oh and um yeah i totally you're kind of a whore so
you're you're coming all the time i assume the worst by the way for uh passionate nerd in chat i
assume the worst about him picking that i'm like he picked that criticism because he knew that he
could defend it as opposed to other ones in the last jedi that are way more difficult to actually
defend he's like yeah let's go with this one because then it'll be a quick defense of the last
jedi during my video about how plot holes as silly to talk about anyway it's just like oh
that was a little bit cheap but okay i kind of want to ask him is like so what about all the other
plot holes in the last jedi that people have a problem with are you just gonna say don't care
about them i mean is that your is that going to be your your actual defense i suppose the point
of that section was people getting information wrong but i mean does he need to actually point
that out that people get information wrong and that's bad because yeah i completely agree i
didn't yeah i i thought he established that human beings aren't always logical i don't
and i don't think you're gonna catch anybody saying it's okay to get things factually wrong
like that's it's still criticism you know when jared explains that han solo was muted by ray
and then he sees the scene again he's not going to go well my criticism still stands it's like no no
it doesn't it's over this is actually as far as i've seen by the way isn't the point of his video
that people are are calling things plot holes that aren't plot holes therefore there are too
many plot holes in the videos that point out the plot holes i mean the thing is i i wouldn't
be too far away from agreeing with him in that there are some things people call plot if they
if he's got somebody calling contrivances plot holes i'd be like yeah that's accurate yeah that's
wrong and if he said people are calling things plot holes when they're actually not plot holes
they're actually explaining the movie i'd be like well that one's just self-evident if this
actual explanation that of course it's not even an error so yeah but his title is shut
up about plot holes and then he opens with saying plot holes don't actually matter
so i'm like that's wrong yeah these these two points are a little bit different than that point
yeah exactly um my comment on his video was that he didn't provide an example where a plot hole
might actually derail the film if his is his contention that that doesn't exist no sense
required and yeah that's obviously no person would uh actually report that fucking perspective
right there's no person on the planet that would say you don't need any sense at all movie or
storyline here's a guy in his comment he said oh thank god someone's finally addressing this i'm
so sick of people pointing out that a film has plot holes and using that as proof that
movies are objectively bad and he misspelled objectively on purpose he says um mauler made a
five hour long quote unquote critique because it's not even a critique that's the thing that
they won't even call it a critique he calls it a critique yeah uh of the last jedi in which he
basically nitpicked plot holes and said that was the objective way to view a film and if you
defended it off any other basis then your opinion is subjective and doesn't matter first there is no
objective way to view a film that's why film has any value in the first place
second even if there was it would be precisely the opposite seeing as though plot holes and
inconsistencies are less than inconsequential less than inconsequential wow what a fucking stupid
ass thing to say yeah people are actually like upvoted and approving that comment and i'm just
like did they read it i'm assuming that they might not have you know i shit i just want to
ask these people like if they say that to me i just want to be like okay so the room is as
good as sis and kane right absolutely because it's like you know they can't actually defend that
well if you recall uh i hate everything's reaction but no no the room is bad though
like yes it is that's a good point why do you god damn it how do you have different standards
for the things you like but yeah like i said i've not seen anything on from this point now so this
is unchartered ground guys i don't know what he's gonna say want you can find plot holes anywhere
they're all over your favorite movies and lord of the rings could have just flown the ring to
okay um okay there's actual lore reasons why that couldn't happen the one thing i would say
about that though is they don't appear in the movie those explanations yeah yeah i will say
i will agree with that but the thing is he's saying it as if this is why this is disingenuous
he picks a popular movie points out a plot hole therefore every movie has plot holes and it's like
no the lord of the rings has a plot hole lord of the rings has the the ghost issue that i would
raise as well but the tradition for him at this point he's like i found this one thing which means
everything else doesn't matter i was gonna say there's a severe lack of frequency compared to
something like the last jedi and does that matter apparently not if there's if there's a plot hole
in the lord of the rings trilogy and there's 27 plot holes in the first half of the last jedi
what you know which has the better you know who which is more consistent oh and of course this
is what about ism as well yeah this is what about ism what about the regals and lord of the rings
and this thing you'd be like okay so reference a movie that does not have a plot hole in it
and a lot of people ask me and like off the top of my head you just have to think of a nice and
simple film that's based on characters alone in like a room you could like for example um
the episodes of tv where characters are trapped in a room they just follow episodes like you're
really gonna find a plot hole in something like that like probably not because there's barely any
plot you can do it what's the what's the plot hole in duel and then you have to think to yourself
as well just because you may not be able to find an example straight off so be ahead theoretically
it's possible because there are scenes in other films we've just recognized that don't have plot
holes which means theoretically you can have a whole movie without them yeah just have a bunch
it just stands to reason that's that's how that works but i would suggest tacitly that in bruge
doesn't have any plot holes from what i know it's a very concise film it's very simplistic it's
three characters in one area and mainly and i'd be like i need to think about it but there are a
couple and again i actually agree with the point that a plot hole does not kill a film
it's not necessary it's all about context context there's a plot hole it's terrible and you can't
like it ever and if you like it you're wrong um real life plot holes the gas chambers were only
in the camps liberated behind the iron curtain and every character backstory contradicts another
have you heard the um the plot hole from life where they said um people are wrong about things
regularly have bad information and misunderstand the news despite having a device that allows them
infinite knowledge from the touch of a button like real life plot holes but you know obviously
there's reasons for all that it's just funny to think about as a contradiction it's like we
shouldn't be in this position yet we are there's a dot yeah kind of what about a kind of documentary
have plot holes i don't know maybe it depends if someone pointed out something about the eagles
thing in the chat that i didn't think of before i'll have to watch i mean i'm already going to
watch the first movie a couple more times before i fully finish up my script on the lord of the
rings but um they said that there's a line where Gandalf says that Saruman controls the skies
which would be true because the Nazgul and the fel beasts were walking or flying around everywhere
which would be fine but the eagle saved him from the Saruman's tower already
at that point they were still on the horses though
all right i hadn't even begun the journey at Rivendell yet still were wiped out until they got
to Rivendell i mean you you'd agree we only needed a line that could make that solid you know instead
of it being like more an inference it might have been a blink and you miss it line i don't remember
it myself i'm still strictly i'm still strictly on the team of lord of rings it's incredible but like
it's you know that one's a bit uh what's the defense for the ghosts by the way
uh the defense for the ghosts is that they were really only coming back to defend
gondor not to attack its enemies that's my problem is that Aragorn says that will release
you for defending that fight instead of will release you if you just wash over Mordor
well they're defending gondor they weren't there to attack Mordor so i guess my conclusion to that
then would be is you have a line where Aragorn says do that and then they say we have no interest
in attacking we weren't interested in defending gondor or something like that how does it go in
the book do they in the book the book the in the book that goes straight up don't actually
make a physical appearance oh they don't even come to meanest here within the book
they only take over the boats and then it's just Aragorn legless Gimli and some other guys
and that's the thing i am absolutely these are these are things are fine and they're ready to
be discussed to sort out and how how serious they actually are and what they can affect
but the idea that you point out one in one film that's popular means every film has them is
ridiculous and yeah someone just donated even Tolkien said lord the rings was imperfect
yeah and that's fine absolutely yeah i mean you should it just you make something that expansive
eventually you're gonna make it oh that's a good point so it's just playing probability at this
a passion that it said wouldn't a plot hole for a documentary be internal bias so like
you you don't show things and do show things depending on what narrative you're running
essentially i'm not sure if that would be considered a plot hole or not but you know
it's an issue within a documentary if you actually do refrain from showing information
that fucks with the narrative you're trying to push but obviously we will continue
documentary everyone look up the video on youtube the greatest story never told it's six hours of
defending hitler i'm i'll guarantee you that you'll come back neo-nazis after it um we already are
though the plot of a documentary i was talking to the chat not just other people yeah yeah yeah
we no need to tell them our conversion story to give an example uh retro hoy did a video on
pelibius is essentially just a series of facts in a row about pelibius the history of the arcade
machine but he has a narrative it's it's a documentary where he's playing it up for a bit
of a thriller so it opens with saying like the the myth of pelibius which is that it was created by
the fbi to try and induce a sense of like hysteria in the people who played it and then record the
reactions and then get that information back to the fbi to judge for experiments and stuff that
was like the thing and he goes over all the information that could actually lead to that
being true and then covers a bunch of games that look crazy and you're like oh my god is that really
fbi and then as the as the story goes on it becomes less and less until it really gets you know bolted
down into a factual just no it's not that at all it was just a fake you know okay that's the
narrative because he could have just opened with saying it's a fake thanks guys come back next time
i'll have all my references in the fucking description but it's like no he wanted to make
a movie out of it he wanted to make it interesting and fun this you guys have seen documentaries
right where they make things dramatic and they sell a storyline with it with a documentary doesn't
have a plot so much as it's about a plot i just you can call it a narrative but they're they're
selling a um a start middle finish they build up for example any of the walking with series is
they'll try and get you to feel sympathy for maybe a here before and they're like look he's
looking after his family and then a t-rex arrives and they're like he makes a run for his life but
then he doesn't make it and it just gets eaten you're like no Franklin but it's uh yeah you know
you don't have to be surgical in a documentary let's see what we got next human saved everyone
all that trouble and toy story why does buzz freeze like the other toys when he thinks he's
a real he's bringing these up as if they prove anything these are like known things that are
really interesting to talk about why does buzz freeze when he doesn't believe in the idea of
being a toy it's like some people argue that he's afraid but uh it genuinely is something you just
have to go oh yeah it doesn't really make sense i guess the whole movie's garbage and you're not
allowed to like it same with the jurassic park in the t-rex scene where the cliff just comes out
of nowhere exactly like we we could acknowledge that's a problem and still like the movie and
it's more interesting you could be like why did they do that why was this mistake made it's like
well they need buzz to be the character that doesn't want to be a toy but they also need him
to not fuck that up early because he also needs to be a toy though he needs to behave like a toy
while not believing he's a toy yeah and you could have had a quick line i guess at the beginning
when he first gets out of his packet with what he explains that he'll be murdered or something but
it's just like yeah it's going to be difficult to reconcile it so we're just going to let that floor
go and you can you can point it out as an objective floor because it is but then you
can be like how much does it affect your enjoyment of the film it's like well personally it didn't
affect me i imagine most kids aren't going to give a shit because you know it's like that's
the subjective side of it it's yay person in oceans 11 how did they get the flyers into the
vault in cinderella why does the glass slipper stay when everything else dude the whole fucking
movie's made of magic fucking idiots magic the fairy godmother could easily have made that happen
considering she's doing all that crazy shit i don't know that's whatever but again it doesn't
even matter that he's pointing these out these are just he's showing that he can do what everyone
else is doing but he chooses not to about the things he likes what about cinderella's theme
oh that's true the plot holes don't don't matter to a theme disappears an alien if the acid can
melt through the floor why doesn't melt through the entire ship in gremlin well wouldn't the acid
just dissipate after i was gonna say why would we assume it goes on forever why wouldn't it react
and then dissipate as you just said like that wouldn't that isn't that what normal acid does
does normal acid go right through the US core do you not know how acid works why would we assume
it goes through forever that's a weird thing to say why would that yeah you idiot go through more
stuff because there's more acid to do the eating congratulations you don't know how acid works and
you made up a plot hole that doesn't exist that was a straight yeah but he's yeah but he smashed
the shit out of that plot hole that isn't a plot hole dude imagine in a scientific lab where they
drop acid sometimes they just go emergency getting fire into the earth's core quickly
have to go yeah just stop the acid um if you drop a single drop will go all the way to as
as rich has just pointed out some acid can eat through granite but not plastic it's entirely
possible it couldn't eat through everything in the ship you never know that's true absolutely
again that ship was massive and someone not know how big the nastromo was someone else highlighted
as well maybe his question is more about how many models does it take for you to consider a movie
bad and my perspective on that is literally just uh it depends how much it it controls the plot
how much depends on how egregious it is yeah there's not a magic number yeah it's always
case by case every film you have to break them down and figure them out and how much uh of these
things we use obviously he's not going to be saying that he's trying to throw it into the section of
none none of them matter get on with it well you know you know how it is these days treating
treating every film as an individual film makes you a terrible critic just like treating every
human being as an individual makes you a racist acid response theory what does after midnight
technically mean isn't it always after midnight how is that yeah that's true that's the problem
with gremlins it doesn't make sense they say that if you feed them after midnight they'll do a thing
it's like but how would everything is after midnight yeah everything is both before and after
it so yeah he's saying this like it doesn't matter like gremlin but it does matter like gremlins
install wars why does the depth star have a trash compactor when they can just jettison the trash
into space because they want to crush it and recycle it i don't know i mean wouldn't just
crushing it into a box and pushing the one neat little box into space be more efficient than
pushing a bunch of other shit in there i don't know why the recycling thing doesn't work
i don't know why the recycling thing has a giant squid in it
here's the thing it wouldn't have to be it doesn't have to be a trash compactor it could be any other
pit that they need to get out of not not just that um but bringing this up i'd be like yeah
that's fair and you'd be like it only it's only invented to put them in danger the way it happens
in the scene i should be like your film's not perfect i don't think anybody would be arguing
that um but again i would just be like it's not really um is he saying this is a plot hole
because they would shove debris out instead of crushing it like i said you could assume
that they were recycling instead of assuming that they wouldn't you know i mean that's equal in
terms of logic you've assumed that they would not recycle i could assume that they would so it's
neutral dude everyone in the chat's like the death star is environmental they're they're
looking out for space pollution yeah uh the existence of the creature inside of it that's
a strange one i don't know how to explain that because i'm assuming it would die if it stayed
in there or if it's got space to stay in there why do they allow it in there i don't know
that is a plot hole like it could be it could i don't know it could be the equivalent of rats on
the ship true the thing the thing is so big or it got it was on some kind of i i don't know if it's
i don't think it's a plot hole it is unusual but you know maybe a ship that big i mean if i was
going to look for a reason i'd probably say a ship that big and with this you know when you think
about all the ships coming and going and where they're from who knows if it got there as a baby
and it grew up or who knows well someone just said what if what if they eat the actual garbage and
that's essentially what those rooms function as someone said what if the empire just likes hendai
yeah i was like the film is not based around a little tentacle monster in the trash compactor
if the tentacle monster didn't exist the film would carry on the same way well this is the other
thing the existence of that ridiculous system if let's let's just assume yes it's it's absolutely
just to make sense if it killed one of the characters i'd be on board with it but it causes
drama that gets solved in about 10 or 5 or 10 minutes later and then we move on with the story
so it's not too significant to you know the overall payoffs in the film is it
can we agree on that because i was going to say the um someone yeah someone said it's subjective
how much these plot holes affect uh isn't that the point it's like well no we can agree that uh
for example obi-wan's death the escape from the empire the explosion of the death star all these
things the biggest payoffs are the things we should need to be invested in so how much does
this existence of this trash compactor and squid affect these things it's like well it kind of
evaporates the drama of them maybe dying in that moment and you're like okay that's a small section
of the film that you could argue it has a flaw and that's if we actually agreed that it makes no
sense for that system to be there which we haven't even got past that yet so would the film be the
same if that whole scene wasn't there i i don't think star wars loses out if it loses that scene
if they fell down the chute and then got out into the corridor like if we saw that as an edit i'd
be like yeah the film's not exactly broken now we're fine if instead of falling into the trash
compactor they were just followed down followed down uh followed by storm troopers the degree
still it could be tense and dramatic it's just a matter of how they wanted to portray that it
doesn't affect the story the degree that a plot hole affects a film's plot is subjective uh it's
it's very not subjective we these are absolutely provable uh cause and effects arguments
so even if you even if you're arguing that it is a subjective amount it is objective that there
isn't a mount at all yes um and all you need and all you need is a little bit and that's enough to
affect it and to quote uh that person in the comments just right h barmer guy everyone else
quinton um when you say that all of film analysis is subjective you've made an objective statement
it is inherently hypocritical
you have to think about it for a while because it's it's some people do there anyway only sith
dealing absolutes he's cut out of his own video this will be interesting look if you want to watch
stuff this way you can even find plot holes in this video why am i wearing sunglasses if i'm inside
first off that those aren't sunglasses i don't think that doesn't hang on prescription glasses
that doesn't affect your plot which is discussing the point about plot holes who cares about where
you are when you're saying it it's something we can raise but like that's not the same at all
yeah i can ask questions about why you're on a roof in a loud alley when you have a nice quiet
room to record in but really i'd be more interested in how can you start off by saying shut up about
plot holes and they don't matter and then also say oh but that one's valid good lord why is this a
point i'm indoors in one shot and outdoors in the next but we never see me go outside no one is
doing that's a plot hole no one's fucking saying that if you see a character in the in a room
and then the next scene you see them outside that's a plot hole because you didn't watch them
go in the elevator the problem is there's no plot to this video i have to ask so there couldn't
possibly be a plot hole i have to ask it feels like there's two sides to the objective subjective
thing i have to ask is this the best you got like you're gonna you're gonna argue that it's
not a real thing because you can pull out plot holes in a video essay are you fucking kidding me
try again you can find plot holes or logic apps in any movie and if you want to
go right ahead just don't tell me that those are genuine flaws and problems how can you okay
how can you have a flaw in logic that's not genuine
it's that you know what this sounds to me this sounds like i can't argue against your plot holes
don't bring them up to me exactly that that sounds exactly like what he's saying he like
that's what literally that's what it literally says that's it's like saying i i mean what would
even be a better example of that it's just don't tell me i can't argue that two plus two isn't for
so don't tell me it is you know yeah what does genuine mean that's where i'm stuck
that is a very what is a gen yeah how do you differentiate between a genuine and an
ingenuine plot hole apparently logic logic doesn't count as genuine but whatever he considers
genuine logic isn't like in it i guess in his collective reasons that a movie is but didn't
say that sometimes these things are valid so now he's going back to his original after flip
flip he's now flip he's flipped and now he's flopped back i mean he's definitely done that
in this video i'm not this video's advocate fyi don't worry about it i i like i like that we can
have somebody to at least try and make him make sense i way prefer it when there's actual because
he sounds insane to me and wolf and rags and fortier right now this is no some nuts go right
ahead free this just don't tell me that those are genuine problems and reasons that a movie is bad
because they're not none of these things actually matter okay so so so maybe he's
maybe he's saying that just because you bring up a plot hole that doesn't mean that the whole
movie is bad i think this is the classic argument dude he's saying that um bad is the process of
you know like when wolf said at the beginning sort of as a joke there's so many problems with
a quiet place you can't like it and i think that's what he is saying we're doing when we call a movie
bad when we mean bad what we're talking about is craftsmanship but a lot of people interpret it as
you cannot feel it's good you cannot feel that you like it yeah it can be poorly crafted but you
can enjoy it absolutely i'm just really bothered by the fact that he's just defending plot holes
as though it's ever a good thing in any way because a plot hole by design is a negative
yeah that's not a it's not a post yeah a film isn't made better because of plot holes how does
a plot hole make a film better that is it's not it's not a virtuous attribute of a film or a story
to have a plot hole it's um you have to give a lot of benefit of the doubt to try and assume
what he's actually saying but i'm assuming he's saying stop telling me that logical things mean
my feelings are invalid which he's right if that's what he's saying but he's coming across he needs
to rescript this like and get words remember the guy we covered who said it was not the literal
hell it was the biblical hell not the figurative hell the technical hell we were just like what
the hell did any of these words mean you know what the hell do these things mean and so people
might be like but more you refer to the film as bad and it's like genuinely if i've only said
it's bad i will usually be talking about a particular part of it as in writing it's more
than likely going to be writing writing is the main thing i talk about so bad writing is not
subjective bad has a definition that you can use to describe for example unfaithful or disrespectful
or contradictive all of these things can come under bad but the other things that come under
bad are feelings as well bad's got a huge set of definitions and that might be the problem
that people assume i'm saying you can't have feelings but like i said i try and clarify by
saying bad craftsmanship bad writing that's not something you get to go you know what no
that i disagree and you've you've invalidated my feelings it's like it's not
12 pipes for griffin dork full of issues that a film has
some of which are apparently irrefutable because people haven't done it
it's much easier to say oh yeah but he said this thing about objectivity and subjectivity which
means i don't have to worry about anything else he said yeah this is the thing by the way we're
trying to offer a scale we have rules definitions and he's just like blah that's how you review
movies now yeah so like how do you review a movie well it's all about whatever you felt and
that's literally the it when you say that it implies that there's just no difference in talent
work effort anything none of it matters because it's all just the results in air why strive to
make a good film or a good story or a good consistent character is what why bother it's
all about feelings just make the most superficial garbage you possibly can
just keep making bioshock infinites and some people love that game well they can they can
love it they can love it yeah there's a set could be wrong it's okay if you're wrong
there is a set of terminology used for critiquing shop composition performances special facts
resonance relevance he's objective to one term used for critiquing writing if he was actually
sticking to one definition of let's say the word bad he needs to let us know bad has got some of
the most i think it's got one of like the most definitions of any word like what are you actually
saying and do you do you care to make it clear or do you just want us to infer it um yeah let's uh
what a movie is about so even though most people are using the term plot hole incorrectly all of
these complaints are rooted in the same thing you say most people it's like he said most people
are using plot hole incorrectly he's like can i get a source on that my dude hey it's his opinion
rags it is his opinion also are we about to find out why logic isn't a good thing oh my god you know
you know i've never i've never heard of smart people say that i've never heard of smart people
there is a trend i've noticed how normally smart people don't argue against logic but we'll see
where this goes rags i'm gonna i'm gonna quote um i've never heard a smart people say that
that's gonna go in my april fool's video i'm gonna say it'll be a great quote yes let's uh let's hear
it
but movies aren't about logic
oh tell me tell me what movies are about tell me what movies are about don't be the guy
to die on the hill that logic isn't in films literally every fucking film needs logic please
don't go there everything in general film books life don't make logic the enemy it's not gonna
end well for you yeah you can't do anything without logic for christ's sake i want you he
needs to understand that he has decided to walk down a road where five minutes into a video he
is starting to talk about the perils of logic and i just when you're at that point where you're like
maybe maybe i should reconsider because i'm actually advocating against logic he's gonna
argue there's all about how you feel it's not about logic that's probably what's gonna be
if logic is watching this in the comments let us know how you feel about this man's attack on logic
it's not like logic's gonna be it but he probably loved this video someone said i never heard a
smart person argue against the logic bilbo ragan they're not equations they're not proofs they're
not puzzles um there is plenty of formulas equations and proofs involved in the construction
of a film really really is like you know cameras they actually the technology yeah there's there's
like actual moving gears these things hmm let's slap him okay it's not about the formulas man
it's about how you feel man movies are not math remember that guy in your freshman dorm who would
always try to guess the ending you know what about movies that are like about math what about
goodwill hunting the film the man who has to do a math problem amazingly that doesn't count what
about um what's the film about alan turing who breaks the codes to understand that he would just
be like no you're looking at it from a position that there's logic in the story but that's not
about how you appreciate the movie man this is just it's like this this it's like this this
post-modernist garbage it just doesn't make any sense it just doesn't matter it's not it's not
there it doesn't have to be there it does it's how do you adopt how do you adopt his ideas how
would you go yeah i actually look at the movies the same way as he does you'd be like there's
just no consistency at all but then you might actually say that that's his argument that no
one has any consistency and that's how you look at films it's all subjective you know someone said
logic is a social construct if i'm if i'm taking a position in my defense of that position involves
me saying that logic is not good i'm like i fucked up somewhere along the road to lead me to this
point yeah because that's the thing right he's been like targeting plot holes or inaccuracies
or misinterpretations and he's like no just logic that's the bad guy you're like oh man
don't do that even i can't fathom being such an unbelievable idiot that i would actually
unironically say we should just abandon all logic i mean how stupid do you have to be to actually
make that point just you know like how a movie opens it'll be an establishing shot it could be
an introduction with a character saying something or a piece of text and i think you know why they
do that is because you don't crash into a movie usually you can subvert that with with some movies
and it works but uh logically speaking we have no reference for what we're about to see so they they
take us in nice and slow and they tell us what the world is then they have events happen because
logically speaking it's pretty difficult to be able to reconcile events without a base that's
that's that's just a logical thing films sometimes do i just i'd start there i'd be like would you
consider that logical and then he's like no man because like we don't judge it as logic you know
i'm just like oh okay you can't just abandon logic or pretend like oh well they didn't do
anything logical in this scene therefore it doesn't matter because movies aren't about logic
i don't know maybe a movie is trying to tell a story and you want to tell a logical consistent
story remember how homer wants to prove to bart that it's dangerous to take his skateboard across
the gorge and so he does it himself you could argue that's very illogical because it's going
to get you killed but it's homa simpson so it makes sense it's logical actually from the
film's narrative that homa would choose to make that decision because it's such a stupid thing
to do it's like this is stop making logic the bad guy stop making logic the bad guy it's consistent
with that universe because i mean obviously it always depends on context as we discussed before
but he's he doesn't care about context imagine imagine a film where it's a bunch of characters
that are different species and they're speaking different languages and every other word is from
a different language and then just random things happen and there's absolutely no sense at all to
the entirety of the film i guess that wouldn't be a flaw because that would be logic i was going to
say that would be his argument i think i think he would say yeah because that could be an arthouse
film in which you're not supposed to have a logical through line and that has value you cannot
say it doesn't have value and my response is it has subjective value you can love all the colors
you can find meaning in all of the imagery but in terms of logic and consistency you got nothing to
work with or you might do it depends on what we're dealing with someone said it's logically
consistent that you'd take two hours to go five minutes into a video well this is the thing he's
covering these subjects so quickly uh but there's huge amounts to say it takes a second to say
something retarded and it can take an age to correct it exactly and and he covers the subject
of contrivance in what like 30 seconds when that's like major for films and storylines but you know
with ban of salt logic that he could prove that he was smarter than the people who made them
well now everyone is turning into that guy on the site movieplotholes.com there are seven
plot holes listed for die hard the first hold them i want to i want to go back and i want to
listen to that one more time because i don't know if that was as retarded as i thought it was or if i
was making it smarter than the people who made them well now literally not an argument what did
he say i didn't catch it all right let's go back just a little bit movies are not math remember
that guy in your freshman dorm who would always try to guess the endings of movies that he could
prove that he was smarter than the people who made them well now everyone is turning into that guy
what okay what does that have to do with anything so i mean am sorry that i am the people that made
them yeah what if what if we are and besides that doesn't mean we're right or wrong i don't even
what does that have to do with anything like a film can be logical without you being able to
guess the ending and what this sounds like this is an attack on critics oh well that's the thing
we've got a second video from him that's literally about attacking critics that's uh much shorter so
i'm interested in seeing that one too but yeah much shorter we take another three hours
well he's just attacked logic he can't get much worse at this point could he
let some of those logic doesn't matter and all those smarty pants on the internet who point out
plot holes and inconsistencies and problems with the film like they think they're smarter than the
people who made the movies like yeah maybe they are maybe they yeah it's possible what what is
the fact that an amateur on the internet well maybe that person is smarter i've met people on
it it's just it's just it's stupid yeah i mean that this is an argument that my dad made once
about the last jedi he's saying all these people on the internet who didn't like it well they're
just a bunch of amateurs and they're they're critiquing some professional production he makes
that argument but that doesn't make them wrong well the the irony the self-awareness you'd need
to really consider and there's a couple people in chat who've highlighted this already but um
do you understand what he is doing right now and he's saying about these people it's like these
people it's like you're you're doing that to their art if their art is to critique films
now you're critiquing their critiques and somehow you're the arbiter of that's right and they're
wrong like do you not see how if you don't base it in any kind of consistency you're just as wrong
as they are by your own logic very true we were all tagged in a we were all tagged in a post on
twitter that says movies are not math and it shows Thanos and says uh purple Bilbo back
on the site movie plot holes.com there are seven plot holes listed for die hard the first one says
that the villain's plan is to stage a hostage situation so that the police will shut down power
to the building allowing them to access the vault but since they would have already had detailed
plans with the building they could have just shut down power themselves making the whole thing more
simple now i know it uh couldn't you argue that the it doubles up as the plan as in they get to look
like they're taking hostages when they're actually trying to perform one of the biggest heists ever
or something i don't know hostages would slow down the police and and let's just run with him
for a second again this is me trying to explain to the chat by the way that this is why it's not
subjective so let's run with that and say we could have had it so that they knocked out the power
themselves they would still need to take care of the hostages assuming they came in at that time
so let's again change it to okay they came in at a time where it was all closed and they knocked
out the power so that they're underneath from from the police being able to get them whatever
and i'd be like again the problem wasn't that uh the police stopped them it's Bruce Willis's
character so i don't know they still end up in the same spot cops outside they have hostages no
power Bruce Willis um you end up in the same place and that's and it's not definitive because
there's a bunch of unanswered questions there because you could be like if they're saying we
did it so that we could get powered down to the vault you could be like well how do you know that
taking down if they took town power themselves that would still attract attention and then
eventually police because they're trying to fucking steal a vault from a building like that
they would eventually find out and actually i just want to clarify as well if that is actually
significant if you actually conclude that it's significant you can be like well yeah that's a
plot hole and that's a that's a flaw does it bother you and you'd be like that's another question
that's another conversation you don't have to just give up you don't have to go you know what
that's it then plot holes don't matter it's weird it's like they're taking the position that they
accuse you of taking all the time yes it's kind of ironic a bit it is really really strange
like we're the ones who are saying a a film can have flaws but still be really good you're
welcome they're saying no uh there's a plot hole that means you can't like it yeah because i love
diehard and uh yeah it's great i could actually you could argue that uh the biggest payoffs for
diehard are all character based and with bruce willis is like can we allow that they do this at
the time that they do it to allow bruce willis to be in the building can you allow them that
convenience to let all of the important stuff happen i'd be like yeah sure but again there's
so many conversations to have and um just say well ah that's it you've put you've pointed out
in enough good films enough films people consider classics that now you know the plot holes don't
matter like that's not that's how this works i mean again if anything that's just what about
ism again you you don't just point out a thing that happened in another thing and then say okay
so it's not a thing now it's not enough seems impossible to watch movies wrong
but you're watching movies wrong oh my god is a movie about an ordinary man thrown into it
remember remember we're the ones who get told we're the ones saying that people are watching
movies wrong i was about to say yeah he's he's accusing us of that when we're the ones
that we're supposed to be the ones that say it someone in the comment section of his video
is saying that basically about you and how that's a bad thing but he's defending the video where
that thing is literally said in the video well they're not listening to the video that's always
what happens with these videos um so dragon said awful video what if someone can't accept
like the the assessment we just had about you know how it works logically speaking and i just
be like that's they don't have to accept it um they can do whatever they want but as soon as they
make videos like this where they actually make arguments and then we can point out inconsistencies
within their own arguments and then they'll be like well everything's subjective i don't accept
it we can be like okay i'm gonna go now you can you do you buddy just stay away from because
i've said it before but like people combine subjective and objective arguments into the same
videos but then they're like no it's all subjective but he makes statements of fact he makes thoughts
he makes the feelings he's got everything all over the place uh while in my videos you'll find i try
and signpost the difference i always want to because it's two different conversations at once
it's the difference between me and wolf saying yo there's this freaking plot hole in this movie and
then just right goes i feel fine about that like oh we didn't ask if you felt something about it
we wanted to know that you accept that that exists in the film and he says it doesn't bother me
like yeah oh we're looking for the first time we get it we don't care about your feelings about
it we want to know that you recognize that these things exist we don't care about reader response
theory we only deal with jared response theory that might be a clip that you want yeah you know
what i think you're gonna make a note of that that's really good to just throw it by series
that's a legit thing that you might want to save whenever people because remember this this this
video is used as an example by people who are liking it and who are defending it and saying
they love it and then they are literally taking the exact things that he is saying and saying it
is a bad thing when you do it but they like it when he says it just an observation yeah we're
the ones that are always told you know are you saying that you that uh you're not allowed to
like this movie but then he's gonna go ahead and say that we're the ones that are watching
we've never said in earnest that you are watching movies wrong or you're watching movies the wrong
way i mean does it not just isn't that just perfect that the people that accuse us of that
when that's literally nothing that any of us have ever said i can clarify it for you because i've
come across this before this isn't the first time uh h bomber guy does it he says that everything
is subjective and then he actually says in his video anybody who plays with a shield in dark
souls as a series is really playing it wrong and he's very serious about this he makes a whole
video where he argues the shield gameplay is passive it's very defensive you're not having
fun when you do that you need to play actively lose the shield start jumping and running
play the game properly and it's the most bizarre argument ever because you're just sitting there
like um you just argue that you're playing a game wrong when your whole thing is that
everybody has an interest and then he comes back with yeah yeah everything is subjective it's my
perspective it's my opinion that you're playing it wrong it's my opinion that you're dumb and so
this guy would say it's his opinion that you're watching films wrong if you do it with the logic
thing and it's like but you just said it as a matter of fact you didn't say it as an opinion
he's like no all of this is an opinion and it drives me nuts it's the most cop-out-ish move
you can ever have in in writing a script it's very very non-committal just like every statement
i make with anger with with perseverance with with uh assertiveness all of it is an opinion
so i know i sound like uh h bomb a guy makes the argument at the end of his video he says i know i
sound very authoritative sometimes but it's just an interesting way of being convincing he actually
says that the idea is that you breach your own values to sound like you're convincing your
audience because you know people get attracted to an asserted voice they're just like this guy knows
what he's talking about i can feel he knows look at the transitions they're so
styley and he's on a riff now and now he's on an alleyway and look now he's at a computer
and it zooms in and has colors it zooms in but i do want to you know people who've
summed up this video i'm like what did you like about this video so much what was the big big
message that this video talked about and i i would love to see why people like this this video is
terrible why do you like it well this is the this is the other side of the aisle man this is
the people who hate our videos because many do they don't like the idea that you're telling people
that there's some kind of scale there's no scale for anything okay and it makes me wonder it's like
what kind of conversations do you have about films do you go hey bob what did you think of the film
and he goes it was good and then he goes what do you think he goes i thought it was bad see you
tomorrow bob like we can't be conflicting our ideas because both of us are right that's the
last thing we need they always want to straddle the line between i i want to always be right
and i can back out of a committal statement whenever i need to so that i can't get criticized
for it that's a huge deal that's what i hate everything puts his disclaimer at the beginning
for he's like if i say anything that's wrong controversial or sounds like it wasn't argued
properly it's my opinion you can't judge me for it that's why i start out the video by checking
that shit in the garbage yeah i don't know if people would have caught that it was good
shit but because i i don't my perspective is you should never need to say uh it's in my opinion
blah blah blah but you you can absolutely do it it's just that you should be able to um put it
forward just by saying i think or i feel but these people don't and do say that randomly so
they're like let me just put the catch all at the beginning so that i cover my ass makes it much
easier for me i know it makes it much easier
so anyway movie about an ordinary man thrown into an impossible so anyway guys leads to rise to
the occasion and persevere so that he can reunite with his estranged wife that's the point of the
movie that's what it's about exactly that was actually the point we were making earlier in terms
of pointing out the plot hole that they could have cut the power themselves does that affect
the payoffs of the film the point of the script does it affect the story being told not really
but if um if for example there was something that allowed the bad guys to kill john mclean
with ease and then you had like a bird flew into the window and distracted them and he ran away
that would be huge to be like oh you just broke the film you just saved his life with a random
bird killing itself what the hell and then some if it was star wars people would be like oh it was the
force yeah yeah that's tragic so uh yeah it's it's really easy to tell the difference of how
important these things are and this is the thing you could be like wait maul you said the die a
die-hard is amazing i'd be like well maybe i haven't heard the argument for how this affects
the entire plot and if i do it might change the scale and i'm happy for that to happen because
we don't you know like rags can you uh argue exactly why a film you haven't even seen is good
it's like no need to see it first it's a preferable thing and it's like i haven't seen die-hard in
i want to say three years at least years it's been many years for me so like all i remember
is loving it i haven't got much objective stuff left in my head i've only got really the emotional
reaction so if someone told me it's actually bad i'd be like okay let's hear it and yeah that i
might need more than just that most of the other plot holes for die-hard listed on the site are
variations on why didn't john mcclean do this well because the whole point of john mcclean is
that he's a normal guy that's not how you counter the argument at all don't give up and just say
this is just a guy that's why he does everything that he does it's like that's what he did earlier
that's exactly what i said you can explain away anything by saying oh the character just does
this one thing you can is it is it so harmful right like let's just say john mcclean had a choice of
picking up a pistol or um i don't know two pistols it's literally that stupid he picks up the one
instead of the two um i could be like yeah that doesn't make sense um how much does it affect
i'm pretty sure he's not a normal guy though because it's like how many normal guys isn't
he he's an ex cop right or is he a current cop i i could have sworn he's not just a normal dude
i could have sworn if he if he was just like one of us do you think any of us would do half
of this shit that he does in that movie i mean i'm pretty sure he's a detective i think we would
be able to i could have sworn he's a detective i don't think he's a nobody i don't think he's a
random john mcclean was originally based on a fictional character detective joe layland uh
yeah people in the chat are saying he's a current cop yeah again i haven't seen the film in ages but
i'm pretty sure he's not just a random dude and that's yeah so to bring it back to my point though
if he brings up to me it doesn't make sense that john mcclean cripples himself by taking one gun
instead of two and then there's a later part in the film where he runs out of ammo let's say i'd
be like yeah that's an actual problem but if he never runs out of ammo i'd be like well two guns
wouldn't have made a difference do you see the difference do you understand the difference how
it could have potentially been something bad and it was a stupid decision that he made however it
did not end up affecting the plot and then as someone else brings up he decides to do a thing
that just doesn't matter what's like he looks in a mirror and goes oh and then looks carries on
like that's weird why would anyone do that i just be like that doesn't affect anything
who cares and i think that's how he reacts to every single thing we bring up about everything
while i'm trying to say this actual like precedence for separating them
instead of just going now they all don't matter
makes human mistakes if he did the perfect most logical thing every single time he wouldn't be
the same character he'd basically be a vulcan and the movie would end way earlier and be terrible
but nobody's arguing that jesus yeah another straw man yeah you he really likes to try to
fight against these arguments no one's making like this really good at it just an easy example
john mclean has a choice to shoot one of two people one of them has lots of guns the other one
doesn't but the other one is the guy he hates earlier because the guy killed his wife or
something you you go he shoots the one with less guns resulting in a fight with someone with more
guns which is illogical but it's supported by an emotional decision that is actually established
do you understand the difference again i keep saying that but like it just feels the need to
keep saying it it's like people have flaws yeah i think people people can make emotional decisions
people can make logical decisions whichever way you go it should be justified or established in some
way yeah instead of just going no he's just an idiot no he's just emotional no that's literally
your honor my my client pleads temporary insanity although it was patty guys that's why she put
everyone in danger she's a patty person they established this she's a petty person who is
this renowned general war hero that we haven't ever heard of before and no one recognizes but
take harry potter and the goblet of fire at the climax of the story harry reaches the tri-wizard
which turns out to have been turned into a portkey that transports him to voldemort so the villain's
whole plan hinged on harry being the one to get to the cup first and win the tournament but really
unfortunately i'm not uh i've not got enough harry potter knowledge to be able to
defend that or accept it i i really have nothing i don't i i don't know a lot of it hinges on what
happens to the portkey after you touch it or did he try and set it up to where here i don't know i
there's a lot of there's a lot of stuff that builds up because this is like the finale of the film
or of the of the book basically in the movie and i don't know if there are any rules established
about how objects act or things like that or if they they made precautions i mean a plan doesn't
have to be perfect but it can have a series of logic to it but i again i don't know i mean i
think that we had characters that were helping harry to get to that point so that he would most
likely be the one whoa what did you say voldemort to have the whole thing rigged i mean with mad eye
moody yeah yeah so when it's just the actual mad eye the whole time mad eye moody made sure harry
won by mind controlling a character among other things yeah yeah so the contest was manipulated
so that um yeah and his name was thrown in by probably moony or something right moody is
so yeah i already am starting to remember bits and i'm just like this is this is why i end up
not being able to watch these videos with any kind of respect because i'm like he's probably
manipulating the what actually happened for a guy who pointed out earlier how people don't pay
attention to films and that's how they miss actual plot holes just like it feels like you
should probably reference that because i do remember moody being evil yeah if i was him
that i would say it's not necessarily the finale it's how come you couldn't make any object the
port key that was touched why don't you make harry's robes in his closet the port
key i'm besides why not why not pick on the time thing from whichever film that's in
there's lots of things you can pick on with the the time traveling thing i forget what it's called
looper no no no in harry potter oh yeah the uh the time turner oh yeah the fucking oh by the way
here's time travel also doesn't really make sense how we're using it and we're never gonna bring
it up yeah i was gonna say we don't really need to go too far into it but like time travel when
you introduce that there's a billion things we can go through in terms of questions and
yeah that was uh that was kind of for me always the big single thing that stuck out about oh we're
just gonna nonchalantly introduce time travel and then it's just not it just is gonna be people
the third one was terrible people are gonna argue that it makes sense right there's gonna be a couple
people out there who will argue that that can work and i'm just saying instead of going into that
because again i haven't seen the film in so long i would rather just say that that would be probably
an easy one to tackle compared to this because like i said i'm pretty sure moody being evil is
like a huge reveal in that film isn't he yes like harry wasn't the actual moody isn't it doctor who
is the the guy who plays him is david tennant he's like he's the one who's shapeshift to look
like him i think well either way let's keep going any random object could have been turned into a
portkey and they could have sent him to voldemort way earlier without all that hassle but that
doesn't matter we're so invested in harry trying it does matter i would say that a massive
plot hole it bothers my ability to enjoy yeah this is this is the problem for me i'm just like
why do you need to write them off like this why can we talk about them and be like yeah that
doesn't make sense and then at the end of the conversation go um so does that affect you know
how you feel about harry potter to a person who's a fan then they go not really and then you go yeah
yeah it just it must be so nice to be able to dismiss any position by just saying it doesn't
matter man it's like i want to be what what a what a great part of the world you live i would
like to refer you guys back to the podcast we did we covered quinton and he said uh character
inconsistencies plowing consistencies and the the world that's just fan stuff that's right
and stuff the rest of it is literally you can just dismiss you could just hand wave it away
you don't need that stuff to be important to figure out a way to win and then so surprised
by the reveal of the port key and baltimore returning that to pick apart the logic of the
villain's plan would mean totally disengaging from the story that's very much possibly a thing that
happens it's unfortunate but that's the result of writing that's inconsistent i am so sorry to
reveal this to you you can and i know how this is going to sound but you can do it you can actually
make magic be something that's restricted by rules if you write the story clearly yeah the
the witcher does it really well uh dragon age origins one of the first things you find are the
rules of magic you know it's just uh it's just it once you once you set rules and ground them
it makes it so easy to immerse yourself in the world and it helps you connect with the systems
that are in place and it offers explanations as to why you can't do x y or z and circumvent
a lot of the challenges but he's contradicted himself again he's saying that um if you think
of all these things it disengages you from the story so like don't bother and it's like so what
about the people who think about these things man you've already referenced that they exist you
just think they're bad people is that how you explain this i mean now you've brought them up
now how many how many people have you got their noggin jogging about this stuff yeah what are you
ruining movies for people there may be somebody in chat now who watches harry potter the next day
and goes oh yeah that can happen it's okay it's okay it's okay to change your mind about a film
subjectively with objective information it's a thing that happens don't try this like so many
plot holes are things that would just destroy any conflict or drama and end the story of me no
it depends on what it is right yeah just write a story without them how about that
i mean just it's like just don't have a story with them do you love the idea that that's just
the whole thing with this video it's like he's just trying to defend plot holes in this whole
video and it's like you can just not not have them plot holes the fact that he accepts that
they exist means that he accepts that they also don't exist as in there are times that there are
plot holes and there are times when there are not why can't we have the one where there's not
you've already accepted that they can pull people out of stories so why not just not have them
i mean why would you hire anybody to be a screenwriter why especially if they say is it okay if i
have a few plot holes here or there you'd be like what why would you why would you want a plot hole
who would intentionally make a plot hole that's it just just don't write the right better stories
we want stories to be better we don't want to just hand wave away the problems that we see in
films and you're just i mean it's like you're you're an apologist for bad writing is it essentially
what you are and this is all coming to this all coming into light because this fucking big ass
movie the last jedi was shit and people can't accept that i have to say i don't know if you
guys have noticed but i feel like the last jedi is resurgent has provided a resurgence of discussion
about writing quality like it was it was going on before the last jedi but the last jedi was so bad
that it's made so many people have to actually fight for it to say that it's good because so
many people are saying it's awful so like there's this big battle going on and obviously people are
now referencing they reference like my video as like oh see it is bad now they're going to
reference this video is like see mola was wrong it's not actually bad like it'll just go on forever
because for some reason people think that this is a counter argument but i'm assuming they were
already uh it's a bit of confirmation bias more than likely they were just waiting like the people
that reference this video to say that you're wrong are people that don't think about anything
because if you watch this video and manage to get to this point
and not think to yourself wait this is this is stupid you're not thinking the reason it takes
us two hours to deconstruct seven minutes of this awful video is because we're actually using our
brains something that this guy doesn't seem to quite grasp we're not just making off-handed
comments to wave away issues and act like those issues don't exist we're not burying our heads in
not just how bad his arguments are that he's also he's inconsistent to himself he's contradict
himself so many times in this video but i can't like how could he even follow his own logic well
then again he doesn't like logic so i don't know yeah logic's bad i we've established that logic
isn't good logic omniscient viewer it would make logical sense for admiral haldo to tell
podamer in her plan and then there will be no conflict and no drama oh my good lord you serious
right now you're making an argument that we had to have holdo be retarded to make a story are you
kidding me that's what you got that's your defense for the last jedi we had to have it be retarded
it was no other choice i said temporary insanity it can explain anything it can explain anything
your honor your honor admiral holdo temporary insanity which is why she did what she did
i just can't even believe this i mean i'm just willing to say that i don't think you're an
intelligent person if you're defending the holdo i don't think so either like seriously
it is the stupidest hill to die on to be like okay she could have just made the one logical
decision that could have avoided so many issues and then this guy comes on here and he's like oh
well actually it's fine to have idiot characters like why why do you defend stupid characters why
is that a defense can we not is it taboo to be intelligent maybe for you because i haven't heard
one intelligent thought come out of your video yet i love the idea there's just no choice like
you just there's just not what else do you do you have to have a stupid character to make a story
what else can you do you can't possibly write a good story without having characters be retarded
also yes chat we can watch that again for that quote let's make sure we're not taking him out of
contact joy or conflict or drama and end the story immediately like sure to an objective
omniscient viewer it would make logical sense for admiral holdo to tell podamer in her plan
and then no no to admiral holdo
to to the people and to all the people involved in the the the film's world to any of
i think this isn't about the audience the audience is just the one noticing this
we're noticing that nobody in the film noticed let's let's let's get the complete statement to
make sure now omniscient viewer it would make logical sense for admiral holdo to tell podamer
in her plan and then there would be no conflict and no drama poe would never send fit on yeah
probably because the movie is so badly written that all the conflict and drama relies on every
character being the stupidest human being on the face of the galaxy like i'm sorry that you
genuinely believe that this movie is good because i i would honestly hate myself if i thought this
movie was good he's he's arguing what we would argue right now he's doing it from the other
side of the aisle so what me and wolf would do is say so because holdo is stupid she ends up
forcing poe to go on a b plot she ends up which ends up forcing fin to go in this fight with
phasma which forces them all to go on crate and actually be attacked so every last piece of
significant piece of drama is all based on this character being an idiot which is terrible writing
his version of events if you don't have it be stupid then fin never gets to face off with
phasma they never get to have their fight on crate they never and it's just like wow
like that actually works people actually agree with that can we consider the last jedi religion
yeah i would say because after all of the atheism religion debates that i've watched in my time
the way that people skirt around logic and dismiss it is something that i have literally
only seen religious people do i mean the people that like this movie i mean i'm sorry but you're
like a cult if you just completely ignore every single problem you're no different than Scientology
well if they're allowed to like it it's when they defend it as good writing as the proper
you can like the movie i don't know how in the world you can but you can like the movie however
you can't tell me this is a well-written movie this is ridiculous this is terrible written
be prepared to defend this uh we never got to mention it to just write but the argument that
she hates poe or doesn't like poe do you remember what she does when he's he's a idacoma she's like
i really like poe i really like that guy yeah and puts your hand on his face like no there's poe
it's just like wait what i liked him so much that i got later to shoot him for me is i almost got
lay a shot yeah i can't i can't believe that he's arguing that uh the reason we need people doing
really stupid things is to enable storylines to happen that's like the premise of badly written
stories it's simple as that and that goes back to what i said about why hire a screenwriter when
anything will do if plot holes don't matter if character consistency doesn't matter if contrivances
just aren't a thing if logic isn't a thing that should be adhered to why hire a good writer and
like i want to present my story to him where um everything's fine they're all on the ship a little
ship turns up it's got phasma on it and she walks on and she says i challenge you to a duel fin and
then he says okay and they fight and he kills her and throws her out the a-lock would that would
that be good because i mean i think that would be really good at least at least she'd be in the
fucking movie she would be more effective but um do something she would be like it would show that
she has some kind of a sense of honor like a soldier's coat of honor or something like that
a one-on-one duel like that would that would legitimately actually be better you know his
argument is essentially right now that as long as it leads to good payoffs the build-up doesn't
matter so uh in star wars episode four luke is talking to r2d2 or whatever he pushes a button
and it teleports him in black clothing to the emperor's throne room and he battles vader and
kills him then or beats him and kills the emperor who you think that is still good i reckon that's
still good i know it sounds convenient that is a teleport thing i know it sounds convenient that
he's just exceptionally good at fighting but i think it's still as good and if oh if you're
gonna use logic and say oh how can you teleport how can you beat him we don't even understand
who these characters are and how they relate that's fan stuff i'm talking about the actual
writing you know the good writing so i hope you guys understand um also ob1 just dies when he
presses that button to get him out of this well you know teleporting it is a cost that's yeah
see that's another payoff ob1 goes no luke do not press the teleport button that is located just
below r2d2's secondary projector file and then he goes and he just like kills everyone on tatooine
i think that would be awesome
i think that we should have that film i don't know
standards what are they i hate them and fin would never grow and
i love the idea that holdo has to be stupid to allow holdo the fin to grow
what they're like all right bad team you're gonna have to take one for the good guys
oh my god i mean maybe he grows like a chia pet
imagine i imagine thinking that the first order should be more incompetent
um i'll i've gotten enough superchats to try and i'll try and catch up to them quickly uh
i guess yeah cosmic dragon greatest story never told an unbridled praise i'm not sure
well that's referencing uh i get it it's uh it's that comment i made earlier about the
greatest story never told that six hour hitler defense video oh right an unbridled praise yes uh
maula please target this guy dark souls 2 style i mean i was actually thinking i might actually
make this public because of how how specific and surgical we've been with every last part of it
i don't see why not i imagine this is the kind of content people want to see for me anyway um
so maybe you know it's it's unusual but the thing is it would actually fall in line with
my response series that i've got two other videos in this could be the third you know
this guy is apparently respected as an opinionated critic of critics though yeah he's he's pretty shit
how dare you rags that is subjective shit is brown and he's clearly not sludgy and brown
um he contradicts himself guys it's easy just think the same as me always about everything
that's the guy's perspective uh could you guys watch the dub of backstroke of the west at some
point thank you i have no idea what that is backstroke of the west wait isn't that the translated
star wars uh i don't know is it it could be that would make sense backstroke of the west
uh the third gather um star wars the third gathers the backstroke of the west
is a bootlegged version of star wars episode three revenge of the sith
oh right yeah and they they've got like a really bad translation right i do i do need to like do
need to watch that eventually oh god i just skipped to a random point in the video and it says
it's grievous talking and he's just like just hopeless situation warrior um i think is what
somebody intruded into come that space general you and not equals who i think
padme amadala's name smelly boy dude dude that's not that's not bad writing right there that's not
bad writing that's incredible writing exactly senator padme amadala's name is the gets the rice
it was oh my gosh wow this is interesting chubaka's name means drag along
that applies to the last jedi i think wow that's some fucking that's some foretelling right there
i fucking shit you not man his name means drag along don't you ever think to discover here from
i clues this time we have no this plan this time your turn escaped r2 um and soon said have your
entire audience spam er on twitter uh to eventually get him which would probably maybe maybe work it's
the fact that he can go on twitter yeah but it doesn't mean he's available to do anything ever
like because he could be on twitter during you know anything so he can anyway um you're watching
movies wrong but anyway guys uh the only thing bad about diehard is an awesome scene when a
foreign terrorist speaks english to another foreigner shoot the glass yeah you could argue
that's slightly inconsistent but again who cares you know it doesn't necessarily change much of
anything um i like that this guy thinks if writers had holdo tellpo the plan the rest of the story
couldn't be written in a way any uh a way affected by that choice anti-bite is a fixed moment in time
you can't avoid it even if you write a way to avoid it the the biggest issue i have with this
is the assumption that you can't generate drama without a stupid person like what does he think
films are what do you think stories are does it always begin with someone being stupid is that
like how we generate drama now obviously such a shame but yes thank you all for uh very kind
donations generous i shall get on with this um um we call this a video right that's that is uh
the the um technical team never it's objectively a video and there would be no story and also
haldo explains why she doesn't tell him the plan she doesn't trust him you see that he made an
argument for how it doesn't matter that she's stupid because drama happens and now he's like
but anyway it makes sense because she doesn't like him come on even jared jennison also says
that she does dude just right gave up on this argument this guy's not going to stand much more
of a chance than what is essentially a classically trained book red university achieved film studying
student okay oh yeah it's just just you're gonna have to put all that knowledge to you so you're
trying to defend this dumpster fire and there would be no story and also haldo explains why
she doesn't tell them but they wrote themselves in that position to begin with she doesn't explain
what she tells them the plan at all she says that you're reckless what does telling him the
plan mean he'll do come on even jared jennison was able to say that purple chick what the hell man
come on even jared can figure this out is he forgetting that everything that's in this scene
right now that you see before you was a scene that they wrote themselves into they knew this
would have when they looked at the script this stupid ass first draft they wrote themselves into
this position don't forget holdo didn't exist holdo's invented the radis is invented layer going
out into space and coming out being of coma is invented none of this was in stone arbitrary
until this film arrived none of this was in stone yeah they they they wrote themselves into this
hole and they could have seen oh we wrote ourselves into this weird hole let's go back a bit and let's
do something else that makes me they wrote themselves into this holdo yeah but instead
they went with the first draft and just went with it dude just go it was a he said there's no fear
criticisms of the film he did so yeah she doesn't trust him and he fucked up and got demoted uh the
funny thing that people don't mention about the demotion is he went from uh fleet commander to
captain the captains aren't allowed to know plans apparently um the the fuck up that they're
referring to is destroying the very ship that would have destroyed them had he not killed it
like yeah we're only we're only alive we only got to this point in the movie at all because thin
supposedly fucked up um and if people are unclear on how that works so when they do the chase them
through the hyperspace stuff the the dreadnought would be there with them it would fire the cannon
and the radis is gone simple as that uh but poe doing what he did retroactively saves the entire
resistance and does he get any appreciation for that no does he get any appreciation for blowing
up the the star killer no that happened yesterday nobody cares what if what if what if he said man
it's a good thing there's no dreadnought chasing us exactly and and so what would holdo was said
what would have holdo said well uh yeah and he's he's like he made a stupid mistake and it's like
so that means he can't know the plan to save everybody captain what's the plan what are we
going to do is like i'm just a captain they won't tell me the plan i don't even understand how that's
an argument like it doesn't follow through it's like oh he made a mistake therefore you do not
tell him how we're all going to be saved like you don't tell the reckless hothead who takes ideas
into his own hands what the actual plan is instead you let him think there isn't one because that's
really clever it's it's a complete mess and i love that he's defending it while also arguing
that nobody cares about plot holes stop talking about them it's like well why are you arguing
against them if it doesn't matter matters to make imagine going through all that work imagine
looking at the dumpster fire of the last jedi and going like how do i possibly defend this oh i know
i'll just say it doesn't matter that was easy this really is a lot to deconstruct by the way
considering we're two hours and 20 minutes into seven minutes and 20 seconds but that is
highlighting how much this guy walks over his own perspective not even kidding as no reason to again
if you think this is a plot hole or you're annoyed because of the logic i wouldn't say it's a plot
hole it's a uh i guess you could call it an inconvenience uh dramatic inconvenience yeah
we're gonna we're gonna have to call a temporary insanity on this exactly yeah that's the way it's
not a plot hole it's not impossible that she would say what she said it's just so stupid
that to make it feasible she has to be insane it's like just lazy writing yeah absolutely lazy
writing but um yeah i don't see i feel like he's just trying to loop it back to his whole argument
about plot holes that's probably what that was here you're kind of watching movies wrong there's
an episode there it is again yeah there it is again just for telling me how to do stuff i like
good to get the confirmation that there is a correct or again there is a correct objectively
there is a correct and an incorrect way to watch movies not a thing that we have ever said this
is a thing that people tell us that we say and we're wrong for saying that but when somebody else
says it they're correct exactly just an observation that i'm making the show community that imagined
what a horror movie would look like if all the characters only made totally logical decisions
yeah i know what he's talking about and it's really funny uh it's a parody basically the joke
is that they're like let's not go to the scary cabin let's go to blah blah blah let's not make
the you know like all the standard stupid decisions in movies that lead characters to being killed
um but the important detail is uh try and tell me all the stupid decisions people made in alien
beyond the only one you could really reference is kane sticking his head into the egg but in
fairness you can absolutely make an argument for curiosity uh you can't do that in prometheus
because of the biologist being completely inconsistent on his his reactions to biology
if you remember he's scared by the bones but he's okay with the penis wrapping around his arm
it was like that's inconsistent but kane is literally just exploring he finds something
that looks so slithery and then it jumps on his face it's like you could be like that was stupid
of him but the rest of the characters get killed after making choices that are logical none of them
do ridiculously stupid things they all like they all systematically get taken down one by one same
for predator by the way it's not a film where everybody's making stupid decisions they do
loads of things to try and fight the predator but it out wits them because it's also a hunter
you argue that horror films do not take place unless people are stupid is ridiculous
that's the difference between good and bad horror films
you're watching magic is wrong billbo baggins
it's like imagine that you you're at a point in an argument where you try to defend your position
and you point to parody you know that's sad that's very sad no but it is i'm just i'm just
happy i saw this episode of community so i know that he he can't get one on me with this one i'll
know what actually happened we have the abandonment of logic we have the outright inconsistency of
flip-flopping onto plot holes are valid or not we have the objective statement that there is a right
and wrong way to watch movies and we have this example that i'm using this is parody that
supports my statement i'm just like how how far down the rabbit hole of stupid do you have to
get until you're like mate maybe i maybe i wasn't right to begin with and judar had said uh like why
couldn't you make a horror film where people take uh only logical decisions you just have to make
the monster be a completely out of context threat and yeah you can you can make the threat something
they couldn't possibly understand or account for so they make logical decisions with the
knowledge they have or alien predator predators exactly that they set up all these traps for the
predator it doesn't work because the predator's super advanced obviously he has to end up going
caveman tactics to be able to beat it because of the fact there's technology detects everything
above caveman technology plus it's cool it's interesting it's actually written in a way that
somebody cared to try and make a story that could make sense instead of going uh that guy walked
over there because he needed to go to the toilet and then he got killed and then the next guy said
i need to go and grab some leaves for a bed and then he gets killed and then the next one says i
want to make out with my girlfriend over here and then they both get killed it's just like yeah and
it's such a defeatist attitude to just say well yeah i mean you you gotta have people be stupid
to have a good story i just i think i think predator kills his argument entirely the predator
fights this entire thing it's just like it's smart people versus a smart monster people are
referencing the thing too the thing that's absolutely valid it's a great example what a
great movie should we go check it out no we should call 911 on my fully charged cell phone lock the
doors and then stand back to back in the middle of the room holding knives and the conclude again
parody because this parody this makes your comedy show man exactly it's supposed to be funny because
they're making fun of your position exactly they're this this thing that you're pointing to
is mocking people like you and you're highlighting it fucking stupid i mean it just amazes me
because he's he's referencing this like it proves his point but he's too stupid to understand what
it was supposed to be in the first place how do you do this it's just the most super this is
this is an example of selling a narrative this is being honest right so it's like he's trying
to convince us that this is criticism of people who think that you you can be logical in a horror
film when what's happening is they're essentially making fun of shitty horror films where people
make stupid decisions all the time but yes let's continue inclusion is that it would be really
boring i am in no way telling you yes you are because there's a right and there's a wrong way
to watch films i didn't even catch that because it it cut off for me what did you say yeah i'll
back up and the conclusion is that it would be really boring i am in no way telling you to turn
your brain off or to not think critically about movies yes you are literally literally exactly
what you're doing right and the clarification is what does critical mean to him if it doesn't
involve logic whatsoever nothing i wonder how long his uh outro and sponsorship thing is going
to be let's hope it lasts five minutes so we're near the end i don't even this is just like this
this video is legitimately terrible this is worse it's worse than that mark brown video you showed
us well mark brown is an offensive he doesn't say anything this guy's saying a lot of things
none of them make any sense yeah mark brown's just a waste of bandwidth but this guy is so
it's just jesus christ this is like imagine shakespeare sitting next to us and i'm like see
this magic box we're gonna watch this man talk to us about storytelling and you just you shit you
sit down with this guy and shakespeare's like that's that's to get shakespeare's reactions
that'd be pretty funny i would love shakespeare reacts to this i would subscribe would be like
vows to art fucking stupid not at all i'm saying you should worry about the things that actually
matter oh my god you've been talking about okay good i love that he's the arbiter of what you
should care about what you should talk about and what actually matters it's like wow you uh
i wish i was you man you're like a god so take batman v superman dawn of justice i think it's
a bad movie and it has big old dumb logic issues like why can superman locate lois lane from her
heartbeat but can't find his mother the same way why doesn't wonder you don't even need to
this film there's like barely anything good about it like congratulations you chose one of the worst
superhero movies ever made do you think his logic's gonna be that you can point out all
these different things that he's gonna say but it doesn't matter i'm waiting for it
a woman who isn't affected by kryptonite be the one to use the spear against doomsday
but those aren't the real problems with the movie the actual problems are that many of
the central characters are serious issues though hang on i want to see what his i want to see what
his definition of actual problems are this will be fun the movie the actual problems are that many
of the central characters are totally static and poorly motivated and they don't learn anything
or grow through the story but the last jedi was great oh my god this is wonderfully hypocritical
i can't get over hopeful this is watching this this is so bad he's telling us now that it's not
about the idea that nothing matters which i actually thought was his position because you
can defend that h bomber guy and quinton defend that nothing is a thing everything is a thing to
who you are it has nothing to do with any standard this guy's arguing that none of the stuff we've
covered so far matters you know plot holes inconsistencies genuine moments in the film
where they've told you one thing and then tell you a conflicting thing none of those matter
it's whether or not characters are flat it's whether or not they are growing which by the way
is another pathetic argument characters don't have to grow to be interesting
i would cite the joker for example do i need any more do you want to keep going because it's just
like don't make the argument that you have to have an arc you have to have growth in order to have a
character be interesting not the case literally the definition of villains most of the time
is that they don't learn they don't grow they're arrogant and ignorant that's what usually makes
them villainous um but then you've got people like jack sparrow or indiana jones or waltus
subchek i think his name is in big lobowski you remember them going on journeys of growth
they're pretty much just the same person at the beginning and end but they're they're really
entertaining dumb and dumber yeah that you don't need them they don't have to grow for that there's
such a stupid standard and just the idea that now he's telling us that we have to value that over
characters being inconsistent doesn't matter if they're inconsistent as long as they grow
it's like if if these are the things that matter then why the hell do you like the last jedi
yeah that's another question but obviously he doesn't consider the problems that he brought
up as actual problems i guess so as much as i enjoy making fun of some dumb logic apps in
that movie they still don't really matter the plot holes remember the plot holes so you're
trying to tell me the supremacy snoke ship isn't powerful enough to penetrate the shields in episode
2 f09 when he plays scratchy skeleton like a the reason angry joe brings up that point is because
the entire film stops working if the supremacy could have destroyed the radars okay yeah the
entire film is based around a flawed premise so that's important that is an actual thing that
brings the whole structure down it's about having a stakes why should we believe that they're ever
in danger if they're just going to wipe out potential dangers without actually explaining
why it's just like oh you know some guy shows up with a gun goes to shoot fin but then it smacks
against his skin and falls to the ground we're like what and then he's like thank god i took that
juice that makes me invincible and we're like yeah i guess that is that is yeah and then he's
like really gonna complain about bullets hitting someone's skin and doing nothing in a movie with
space wizards you you're like this nerd guy from the simpsons he's like oh yeah okay joe bless his
heart actually is right yes he is that's a that's a big problem it's unbelievable that the supremacy
doesn't have firepower to be able to actually hurt the radars at all at that range it's like
seriously like what what's the point of it existing what's the point of being a military vessel i
love this shit man no you're just a nerd you're just a nerd if you say this stuff nerd let's say
that i'm a nerd now i answer the question it's like yeah what about my argument xylophone he
strikes the same rib twice in succession yet he produces two clearly different tones
but it hasn't always been this way that's true yeah how did we get to the point where people
care how do we get to the point where people don't care about bad writing anymore yeah
yeah that's right these are early 2000s no one really cared about plot holes oh my god even as
a child no no here's the problem here's the problem we cared about plot holes it's just
that over the past like five to ten years plot holes have become a far larger issue than they
have ever been because people like you are terrible writers and don't understand what
you're talking about and people like the rest of us actually get storytelling are you just a nerd
well i guess i am a nerd because it probably makes me smarter a moment of clarification
this is genuinely a theory i'm not going to support this until i actually like say i made
a video on it but um plots i don't know if you guys agree with this plots used to be a lot simpler
these days we're getting stories that are like they can't sit still they have to be like
really epic and crazy and all over the place kind of like game of thrones syndrome where people
are like oh people like more complicated part equals better film that's the logic that seems
to happen the more shit that's happening the better so many classic films have really simple
storylines like aliens the easy reference aliens so simple it's ship people on ship find alien
kills all of them that's it it's this and you describe that so many people like that sounds
kind of boring it's like yeah watch the film it doesn't it doesn't need to have a complicated
plot uh predator is the most complicated thing in predator is that they go to try and rescue
some people who've been captured and then it turns out that it's actually a different problem
for them to deal with like whoa oh shit you catch that but look at you know um Jurassic World 2
it's like okay so the island we had is there's a volcano on it now and there's an agency being
set up by ginger girl from the first one who's trying to rescue and protect dinosaurs also
there's a third faction that's being run by the guy from the first one's partner that didn't exist
before is protégé that wants them to go and rescue the dinosaurs but in actuality wants him
to bring them back so he can auction off the several different black market people who are
trying to use them for weaponized experiments also they've created the indorepter out of
material that they grabbed from the indorex when they sent people to go and retrieve that
in the pen you just like uh like what if you just did something simple really well
like instead of doing five things poorly a people a couple people pointed out movies like 2001
A Space Odyssey they're not simple but the problem is that they're they're done well
and they're made by people who have talent so you can make something that's complicated it's just
that you need to have talent to do it and if you don't then it's going to be bad we don't deny the
plot holes existed in other films we don't deny there was plenty of awful films back in the 90s
there's always awful films there's always great films but uh all of the classic mainstream films
that came out then versus now it seems to be the plots have gone a lot more complicated and what
happens when you complicate plots it gets more difficult to write them consistently it's more
difficult 2001 was awful imagine it's like imagine every time it's like laying it's like throwing
mines in front of you is essentially what building like lore in a plot is the more shit
you put in there the more potential there is to step on one of those mines and ruin the consistency
so when you only throw out a couple it's really easy good Aiken's really simple it's guys dog
is kidnapped he goes and gets it back it's like yeah that's a great movie and it's really fun
it's a fun movie it's like it needs to be more complicated than that but the you know what's
going to happen in the new predator for example the plot is going to be so damn complicated it's
going to be there was one i'm pretty sure we've read the um the leaked uh script the
oh not script the leaked plot points that match the trailer it's like uh team of people find a
piece of predator stuff that landed earlier new predator is sent in to retrieve that stuff that
landed but also the government are after it also he sent the pieces to his son and now everyone's
trying to get to him and it's just like whoa whoa whoa what yeah he sent the alien spaceship to his
five-year-old because i can't wait to find out why that happens it's in the trailer so i was like
they actually do this what is the fucking reasoning for this what could they possibly do you're like
no it has to be the predator's son oh okay all right yeah so like the son of a mask but even worse
so yeah my my theory isn't that we've become hyper aware of plot holes because of the
dissemination of information and discussion thanks to the internet which is the theory a
lot of people have my theory is that as time has gone on trends happen hollywood's convinced that
the more complicated a plot is the more likely you'll be respected for having an incredible
plot just it's just like it's gone into a lot of lead writers again prometheus is extremely
confusing when you consider all the events that happen in that film and try and actually reconcile
it all versus alien i don't i don't even know where to begin with that but maybe this guy should
recognize that if you see a trend developing maybe there's a reason for that maybe the reason
so many people are noticing these plot these bad plots in movies is because movies are there's a
lot of bad plots in movies i think we must be getting close to some form of ending so it looked
like he was closing out so maybe there really is like four and a half minutes of you know
got to show out square space no one ever complained a movie was bad because of
all the plot holes so what happened basically the internet i knew it was going to be the internet
blame it on the internet why not people couldn't talk to each other before that's the thing the
internet invented because i like driving myself insane i searched back through google year by
year for references to plot holes until about 2007 they only appeared in movie reviews and
forum posts they hadn't gone yeah okay what you're missing here is that it's terminology so people
would have said hey man does it make sense that happens in blah blah blah and someone else who's
a really big nerd reviewer friend goes that's actually called a plot hole and then they'd be
like okay frank anyway doesn't it like sound kind of weird that this thing happened that doesn't
make sense because of this other thing it's like people stop using the word until it became defined
so it's easier to translate an idea we talked about this on one of the streams about gamergate
the the suffix gate is a new thing and it let it's a shorthand to communicate an idea
it's the same thing for plot hole not everybody knew what plot hole meant not everybody used the
words i can tell you i didn't know what it meant until i probably was above 10 years old but i was
still noticing plot holes doesn't mean that they didn't exist before the word was used but come on
you know it all it all came out in 2006 man because he thinks this proves that people
weren't talking about plot holes all this proves is people weren't using the word
i'm sorry someone uh someone sent in a five dollar super chat saying hey there wolf man and i just
wanted to point it out because it said his name is precious crystal fox boy you know i'm okay with
this precious crystal that's probably a good lead in for me to cover the other ones uh also let's
be really honest shoving politics into films is ruining them i mean female predators really
i mean i wouldn't take that away from you that how forced it is in the last jedi with the uh
slavery bad capitalism bad um abuse bad yeah i mean there are as i understand it i'm not
a super huge predator fan myself but as i understand it there are female predators
it's just it's just more the fact that like the movie isn't even out yet and there's
outlets that are like praising the movie just for having female predators the script hasn't been
touched for the buffy reboot and they can't help telling everybody buffy's black it's like why
why does this help anything it's like please appreciate that it's like okay it's gonna be good
just like ghostbusters was so shut up about my hypocrisy i was like the name of this video uh
only last jedi fans could justify their movie by saying bad writing is necessary when that's
been a bad thing long prior to the last jedi coming out well yeah this is the thing the standard has
been forgotten standard people like this guy and seriously just right and seriously quinton
they're not helping they're telling everybody that bad writing is just normal and it's like
it's not normal at all this it's you know you know the people who say that um the people who
say bad writing is normal pride bad writers probably uh because if you treat it as something
that you can just everybody's made this point who has uh criticism of bad writing if you don't
highlight good writing and criticize bad writing then then why even have writers that spend more
time or less time or have more talent or more experience what is the point in any of it you
should just blip on the page and just deliver it and everybody gets to say why do you think things
do better and do worse why do you think these things are taught why do you think there are
people out there who say this person is a better drawer than you and then someone goes subjective
why do we hold up old films as being very good what makes it what makes one of those old films
that you love what makes it good you know what makes it is things that we strive for
are when it emulates what stands the test of time do the prequel stand the test of time or does
the original series or the original trilogy which one of those is going to last longer
force awaken has totally missed an opportunity to make fin a veteran stormtrooper who finally snapped
and provide context as to why he can kill them exactly i'm going to be covering that in the
series because it's a major missed opportunity one of many and if you want to blame the rise
of criticism of plot holes and bad writing blame the disgust the oscars generate every year even
jared gets that of course he does jared jared does actually have a lot of insight you guys need to
but yes um let's hear about that i hope daisy ridley will be the female predator
oh one last one films have become political outlets for directors and writers now not
creative tools like they once were oh yeah there's a lot of there's a lot of agendas there's always
been agendas but um i don't know subtlety has been blown out the window like people don't need
subtlety anymore like timeless messages yeah now they're just like this is a this is a political
trend anyway fully mainstream yet they hadn't been embraced by the public but then in 2008
cracked published the article really you're gonna cite cracked is the reason that everybody knows
what a plot hole is eight classic movies that got away with gaping plot holes there were more
forum posts then in 2009 the tv tropes page for plot hole was created in 2010 i noticed that he's
like close to the camera the lighting dark like with plowles didn't exist before the internet did
2010 was when plot holes became a thing we're in films didn't have plow holes before this
i cannot believe i cannot believe you actually said that how can anyone say that and this video
has been full of those my brain i feel like my brain just snapped in half
that is absolutely unbelievable oh let's continue really began articles on wired the escapist den of
geek and kotaku it doesn't fucking matter where they were and when they were it's just a way to
categorize a thing that already exist are you telling me the plot holes didn't exist before
the word was actually coined do you think people never noticed what a plot hole how do you think
people in language how do you think kids refer to anything if they've never heard of the name for it
before i think that's something you need to understand is that before before sir isaac newton
never fell towards yeah we all just floated it was you see isaac newton basically ruined the world
it's all his fault we can't fly anybody was just floating around having a great time flying around
all of a sudden this asshole all right he gets hit in the head by an apple and has an idea
and everyone just dropped and there was no more fun after that and then cancer happened
oh everyone got aids nerd culture they're right nerd culture just stop
it's coincided with the arrival of mystical articles and plot holes were the perfect click
base nitpicks about i can't believe this is what i mean by a narrative he's making listen to the
music and the way rags highlighted how he shot this he's making this seem like it was a disease
that spread as if nobody ever would have talked about this before somebody mentioned the word
it's insane does he actually think this is true and what's the point that he's trying to make here
they exploded in popularity why i would be as people give a shit because this is a good thing
if this actually promoted critical thinking it's a good thing yeah this is making us examine the
media that we consume it's making us look at it stop making us really see what's good and bad about
it why is that a bad thing to you you should be glad that people had their eyes open about this
could it possibly be a good thing that people are using their brains and it's like i don't see any
part of these articles that say you shouldn't like these movies now even if they did they'd
be no worse than you you've already told us that we're watching movies wrong it's just insane
that he's going he what do i have to do to make the last jedi not suck
yeah that's that does actually feel like what the title of this video should have been
i must try everything popular things that could reveal things readers may have missed
but 2012 was where the change really happened this was when i can't get over the way he's
delivering this it's so funny now it's 2012 it wasn't actually 2010 2012 was when dude i'm waiting
for him to be like and then came 2018 the army invaded each of the countries suffered you're just
like wait everything changed when the plot all nation attacked that's like the easy fucking
reference but i just what is it youtube that did it plot holes started taking over youtube pop
culture commentary from a nerdy fan perspective i was ranting about films well before youtube
existed mate and it was the exact same scale it's also important to note that he hasn't described
what's bad about nerdiness no he's just said it exists people throw out people throw that out but
they don't ever describe why it's bad dude and then trump got elected enter donald trump oh man
it began exploding in popularity and immediately the types of videos that see a lot of people cite
cinema sins as a bad influence on people i was like oh the people actually like
think that cinema sins is like teaching people how to watch movies i thought it was sort of a good
just an amusing fun channel yeah is i i've never really taken cinema sins too seriously and half
the time right if cinema sin says something like oh it doesn't make sense for example the point he
brought up dj shouldn't know the the plans for the resistance and thinking then i'm watching it
and i'm like well he should because the other scene so there you go you fucked up and in my
head i use critical thinking to counter what he thought was critical thinking bad mauler
if there are kids out there who are watching cinema sins and then go in you know what all
films suck that's that is that's just on them for not thinking clearly what if someone what
if some kid loves cinema sins and they're just like i'm gonna do one about my own and so they
open up a movie and they watch it and they have a list like what are all the problems that i could
find you know think of all the critical thinking that that's their brain running yeah yeah we're
gonna talk about the good thing because he's making this seem like to not enjoy a movie is to die
isn't it isn't it well i mean it's probably it's probably worse to not enjoy movies and
die oh somebody said uh yms has commented on this video as in the uh the original video apparently
agrees with uh so of course he does yms isn't stupid they're all you are master of the four
plot hole elements could stop them but when youtube needed him most he vanished so well yms
follows me and i guess you on twitter so maybe holy shit his comment is enormous jesus i'm not
reading that right now we got our own shit to do well net let's because oh i guess it's on um i
guess it's on reddit no no it's on the video this this this actual video is shut up about
plot holes now let me check it but it's like i said it's huge dude you're not gonna be able to
go through for a good five minutes at least so we'll just we're near the end of this video i'm
almost in approved most popular were humorous analyses of popular movies focusing on surface
level nitpicks yeah that's your assessment of that that doesn't you've not provided any
fucking criteria for how it's surface level and we have by the way that's why our thing has taken so
long we're trying to explain the difference between surface level criticisms like gandalf
wearing trainers in one of the scenes in return of the king versus something significant like
polto polto holder is retarded because of uh because we need the plot to happen it's like
do you not even see in your own argument how that's a significant issue or do you just oh jesus
i found it why i've got his i've got his comment here we can it's like a brandon sanderson novel
holy shit i was gonna say that i was gonna opt out of reading it just because of how long it'll
take for us to get through it because we're gonna want to comment on what he says as well
i mean should we do it after we finish this video because we're pretty close i think
sure and over the next several years these types of videos i just um i just told him he's watching
movies the wrong way number and popularity for many people especially millennials and
whatever oh my god especially millennials oh this is getting cringy now next he's gonna say
millennials next he's gonna say that if you look at people using the word plot holes they're usually
uneducated statistically why can't you millennials just shut up and like what shoved in your face
you millennials watching films wrong never make that argument dude never never label your
opposition how old is this guy he's probably a millennial himself millennials are very
millennials are very very broad i mean he seems like he's 32 35 like this is just game like just
around millennial this is getting a bit spiteful now it's like you guys just yog stupid and you
watch things wrong you know and all these other guys like they they genuinely dislike the fact
that not just like in this annoyance way but they genuinely dislike the fact that people don't like
their shitty star wars movie also they don't like their videos because honestly like this
this video has more issues in it probably than the last jedi is opening half an hour probably not
more than that though this is fucking terrible duration after millennials is called most film
criticism they consume is on youtube why is that bad also what the hell the idea that it has to be
millennials because it's on youtube there are plenty of 40 plus year olds on youtube dude
yeah like what the the age of the person making the argument where their video is uploaded to
has nothing to fucking do with the points in the video let's be honest rags he's actually
trying to argue here that the people who care about plot holes are immature now that's like
that's an actual argument he's trying to go with here just like dude no need to throw mud make
actual arguments you don't need to do that someone in the chat said he's probably a magga wearing
guy who voted magga wearing trump loving conservative mates and women yeah but normally
the criticism about millennials is that they're stupid and brain dead and his criticism is that
they're not just accepting the garbage thrown in their face they're they're being too critical of
stuff it's almost like he's running out of arguments these are the bottom of the barrel ones
you'll throw in just in case running out jesus and not all but a lot of this is surface level
critique focusing on there he goes again he's about to call potholes he just called potholes
nitpicks because what else can he do man he's pulled out everything else oh yeah well that's
just an you you just pointing out this plot hole but i wish the entire movie is centered around you
just that's just nitpicking the dude demonized logic the dude demonized logic like i think he's
he's far gone at this point he's not like you could do much else with him x plot holes plot holes
don't really mean anything but they're good clickbait i thought you just explained to us
what it meant to admit it too you were like a plot hole is a blah blah blah blah but plot holes
don't really mean anything so what i'm gonna do is i'm i'm gonna save this video and download
how do you contradict yourself this much in this amount of time by the way god damn stupid
bean-headed looking ass nostalgia
that's probably one of the biggest insults you can consider in the amount of criticism
he's giving you freaking nostalgia critic knock on like i just people watch them and
believe them and repeat those points in congress yeah what do you think people are gonna do with
you buddy yeah i mean besides does the fact they repeat it make it wrong oh this is bad
just just in case you guys went this i thought i didn't think when we got to the logic is bad
i thought this couldn't get worse but he managed to do that also you said you said you're saving
it you do you actually want to reply to this video now is that no i think that he might take this
shit down oh right that makes sense i think that he might legitimately remove it because especially
with yms you know i just i don't know man it's just people because the people who see the movie
first or uh the see the videos first they generally upvote it because they follow the person a lot of
them upvote it without watching the video and then once it's been out a little bit then everybody
else catches up and watches it and finds it and like this like i think you guys need to understand
this video is fucking garbage this is a terrible video this is awful i'm legitimately interested
to see i want to ask people who thumbed up this comment or this video why they did so
someone said christmas you should have some bowel big bigs
yeah by the way it's a complete fallacy to say that if you were like the idea that you repeat
someone's arguments that means you must be wrong sort of thing it's like you can repeat an argument
that's true without realizing that's what hella greedo did people just say it over and over but
is it really a problem like yeah like people say the sun is you know a star over and over
they must be wrong at that point that's just what everyone says yeah there are some people who
considered the fortier doesn't talk enough it's just the me wolf and rags are much louder and
ego driven and we want to jump in on this guy the second he says a thing so fortier is just
biding his time for a smarter scared better looking at better profile pictures he is actually
better looking than all three of us i'm sorry fortier is quite sexy nope you should get rags
a picture of you just to get a rating oh you want naked or like preferably i mean come on
we're gonna go all the way man front yard backyard whichever is the biggest asset please watch some
hello greedo videos we did the one on the other podcast but he'll probably pop up again everyone
wants to cover everybody at this point because it's just like kill them all sort of thing it's
like all of these people make terrible videos kill them if you have to and when they watch
movies they think about these surface level nitpicks they look for them no one is really to blame
for not surface level if they break the whole movie yeah a plot hole isn't so he just said
nobody's to blame for this while except cinema sins it's just like dude don't witch hunt you
piece of shit leave him alone cinema sins is not very good like i completely agree but like
don't be like cinema sins is to blame for people saying that your feelings are invalid it's like no
no no it's like his videos are amusing it's not his fault that his videos got super popular
i mean you can argue that like he wanted that of course he did but it's you're saying that his
influence is like a problem and it's like he just he made his videos fair and square his influence
is a result of people finding it you know interesting he made stuff people want to see
things definitely deserve some of the blame but it's not
yeah no one's to blame except cinema sins i like it i like it because of how subtle it is
not just them this is way bigger it's as subtle as being shot in the face coinciding with evolving
technology and look as long as movies are popular and people on the internet are making videos for
clicks it's going to keep happening as if this isn't as if this isn't you making a video for
clicks you piece of shit come on music and the sound effects in the back i'm sure the all caps
the shut up about plot holes i'm sure none of that was clickbaity i'm sure this is just like
you being like that's a perfectly reasonable thing well you know when i make videos i don't
want anyone to watch them that's why i put them on youtube publicly like stop making this retarded
argument that it's like it's for clicks like no shit he's throwing out he's throwing out quick
fire arguments that are just the easiest to knock down these are crap like all these ones at least
the other ones are like complicated ideology ones that you can break down but these ones are just
petty as fuck this is petty crap so look watch whatever youtube videos you want thanks dude
about movies just please thank you
shut up about the things i'm too stupid to understand you can you can do whatever you
want say whatever you want think whatever you want just don't do this okay those things it's
just and it's this stupid style about i'm gonna make this style yeah i mean that was totally
impactful right let's see what he's chilling for the end though was the punching too aggressive
maybe a bit that was a joke please laugh
thank you for yourself he went up on the roof to make that ow oh no he's doing the same thing
that marked round like i would and i want to thank sennheiser for making this possible
you couldn't have done this without sennheiser i'm not again i always want to make this clear
i'm not criticizing anybody for having sponsors and stuff it's just funny to me because they always
pretend like it's a coincidence that this sponsor happens to be super useful for their video and it
was just so good that you guys need to get it too it's like yeah it's like i might is like i
is like i've toyed around with getting a sponsor because youtube just shafts me so much um but i'm
not going to be like oh i couldn't have done this without my sponsor i was like i could not have
made this video without sennheiser this could this physically would not have been possible if
i did not have the sennheiser g4 uh wireless microphone recording system
it's don't get it this was this is sennheiser sennheiser don't don't be racist to the
the german's holocaust holocaust holocaust i was making almost all of my videos i've made with
windows fucking movie maker it's like don't give me that garbage about how you needed sennheiser
that's a subjective argument you know vegas is no better or worse than it neither is premier
you know photoshop is no better or worse than paint let's be honest super male vitality
so i'm just gonna read out the the super chat i've had while we've finally got to the end
films have become oh wait i wrote that one does it matter what people hate is a movie as long as
someone finds fault with a movie in a way that it detracts from the experience it's valid in a way
it's always valid feelings are always valid because all that feelings require to be valid
is that you felt them and no one can prove that you didn't so they're always valid like i say that
from a logical perspective because what are you gonna do tell someone they don't feel the way they
do it's like yeah how you gonna prove that good luck is impossible so subjectivity land
everything goes because there's no way to prove it wrong so if you bring objectivity in to your
feelings like i feel good and that's objective because this film is bad vice versa it's just
like this that's a reason but it's not like you're saying that everyone has to feel that way
so you know it's just something that for some reason these people think that we're
um encroaching on that that we're trying to tell them they can't feel things when they actively
tell us how to feel in some of these videos so bizarre um is it just me or does he seem kind of
disdainful towards more casual lay criticism just because he went to film school doesn't mean that
everyone else is wrong uh yeah i got a huge impression especially towards the end this guy
is tired of being told that there are plot holes in films not that he's allowed to not that he's
not allowed to like something that literally people are set he's a critic and people are sending him
counter arguments to his assessments that stuff like The Last Jedi is a masterpiece that's gonna
happen i think it might be because he sees himself or pictures himself as this kind of like
old guard movie critic yeah and youtube brought with it the ability for people to grow an audience
and in in a way that didn't require this massive career that spanned degrees and publications and
newspaper columns and video appearances but essentially what happened with criticism is that
it was it basically became far more open and as a result of that all these up and comers came around
and people wanted to hear like people like me people like mauler just people people like who
else is in here i don't know both oh yeah that's right yeah you're here um but um yeah a bunch of
basically a bunch of just random people on the internet that people would rather listen to
than these super professional you know older style movie critics usually comes down to it they
make more sense like they're listening to us over there and they're like these guys make more sense
you know you know so this you know it's the bottom of that it's a little thing called logic
and i know you hate it but it's um it's a neat little thing a lot of people like logic it's cool
um there's a guy who named himself after the weird logic called logic so he runs a channel about
logic people like it that much he's a black guy when things make sense things making sense is cool
but it's not stupid millennial i was gonna say it's pretty nerdy of you for tears pretty nerdy
thing to say um how much more would i need to donate for all of you to slap this complete
fuck where he's in several from this video his arguments are just breaking my mind you don't have
to donate shit i do it for free well we've given him a virtual slap to the face i think with this
stream but uh dude with your mouse just like wait make the sound effects again
there you go perfect um uh kids don't watch older films anymore because streaming allows them to
just watch anything modern when they like i had to watch 80s films because that was all
that was on the tv at the time um that's genuinely my upbringing if you will for um
i was watching 80s 90s movies when we were coming close to 2000 because that's all the
movies my dad had and i was like whoa watch plenty of bad ones watch plenty of good ones and
then start watching new stuff and it's just like yeah that's my premise for how i've got a scale
for judging films is i've seen a ridiculously large amount so i've seen what i would consider
to be the worst and the best and the last jedi just sat in a particular part of the scale
and then i needed to to explain why did people so yeah people not being able to if all you watch
is stuff like jurassic world 2 last jedi force awakens black panther um the meg aquaman uh then
you will say you're gonna say stuff like this guy you're gonna be like uh they're just as bad as
each other everything's bad these days okay it's like wait what obviously he doesn't use the word
bad but what he's saying is the stop pointing out plot holes when everything has plot holes it's
like no not everything does dude you need to see some good movies it'll help you with your scale
because apparently you're desperate at this point it's almost like they they treat film as this very
very high art and then a bunch of modern movies come out that are shit and they're like fuck
well what am i gonna do now exactly uh i wonder what he would say if you like compared to different
films like if you take one that is just like really really good and compared to the last jedi
and have him compare the two films to say okay so this one has you know five million plot holes
and this one has one what we need to do is i would love to get um if anyone out there is in college
university or whatever and if you're if you if you have some sort of an english literature class
or storytelling class i want you to get your professor to watch like maulers videos on the
force of awakens you know and and i would i want you to see what a like ten hours i was gonna say
that would be like i'm always about time on it someone who's you know maybe you have a professor
who is really they really like uh like the force or the last jedi they really like star wars they
like the stories and stuff but i would like to see like what an official tenured professor with
the degree in college you know has to think about you know this you know that sort of thing i would
like to see out of curiosity with what they would have to say about it it depends what it literally
depends on what kind of when you find because he could be the guy that they go to he could be
teaching somewhere this guy right now so you tell him it's nonsense but then you could find somebody
with you know integrity and then you'd be like oh neither way then we would i hopefully i would
like to see that recorded you know like just to have give their thoughts on it so if any if
anything it would let us it give us like a window into their way of thinking um this video ends at
11 10 we're almost there boys like yeah we've hit the end um but holes more like not holes kill them
all become god of the new youtube we're breaking the conditioning and the last one can we start a
scholarship fund to send jared genesis to film school i would want him teaching i would want him
learning response theory want him to experience it yes uh thank all of you for the incredibly
generous uh especially the 50 donations i was gonna say do you guys want to check out
yms's comment now uh i can read it go for it obviously stop whenever you want if you want
to say something about it all right i can probably get it on screen
he posted yeah he um so let me i've got i've got my script behind it for that i'm working on so
i better not move it save the fucking video um let me go to give me a second
oh my god script leaked well they can only see the uh there's several links the prep for my
script but even if they did see the script that's okay you guys could really see it if you really
want to all right so here is the um here is the your movie sucks dot org response to this video
i typed out a big comment in response to this video being posted elsewhere so i thought i'd
just copy and paste that here so here it is i think he kind of misses the point about people
acting logically it's not an issue for someone to act illogically it's an issue where the illogical
and out of character decision they make is forced in for no reason other than to enact a plot device
it's not illegitimate to prefer stories that flow in a natural way compared to ones where you can
transparently see every single beat in the script that was my biggest issue with a quiet place
the plot device conflict came in at the expense of the characters they weren't real people anymore
they were just props to force more conflict into the story with every action they made
i don't think that's an unreasonable thing to point out what's really weird is that he's coming from
this from a really elitist angle i'm not sure what he thinks of my channel although a few
commenters seem to think i fall under the category of what he's criticizing but i'm constantly making
sure to communicate that even though i'm mentioning parts of the film that bother me those same aspects
might not bother other people i always make sure to communicate that everyone has their
threshold for what they're willing to accept and that not everyone weighs the same aspects
of filmmaking equally and here this guy is saying that plot holes can't be considered problems with
the film and that it's illegitimate criticism to express your thoughts on them when talking about
your experiences with a film what that's basically just gatekeeping at this point i completely
understand his perspective and i find it completely legitimate to not be bothered by any logical
inconsistencies in a film but to claim that it's not legitimate whatsoever to consider them as
flaws is just elitist nonsense it's always so weird to me when people try to delegitimize other
ways of thinking rather than accept and understand other points of view if an aspect of the film
winds up making the experience less believable how is that not a legitimate thing to mention
if a film's writing presents that prevents the characters from being believable how is that not
a legitimate complaint i'd be interested to see exactly this guy i see what exactly this guy
considers to be a legitimate flaw because anyone could easily use the same logic against him for
that by his logic you could make the same arguments he's making for literally any complaint about any
art whatsoever by his logic there is no such thing as legitimate criticism anyway excuse my
little rant here it's just always so frustrating when people try to claim that you shouldn't talk
about certain aspects of your experience watching the film like it's my experience if there's
something i want to mention about it i'll mention it i mention every aspect of filmmaking that
stands out to me lighting shot composition soundtrack acting production design special
effects etc it's stupid to say that you're allowed to have whatever opinions you want on
those but that plot inconsistencies are off limits for some reason i make videos expressing my opinion
on my experience of the film i'm not going to start omitting aspects that stuck out to me and
affected my experience just because some people decide to look down on any criticisms that don't
bother them personally get off your high horse that's his original comment which yeah i liked
it because i just agree with all of this so far that's what we said people in the chat said uh
he he that discreet like yeah i know i i liked it off with you talking about i was like hmm
yep i like this so he he edited this comment he went on he says so i continued watching the video
and found where he talks about what he considers to be legitimate flaws in justice league as expected
his criticism are just as if not more subjective as any complaint about plot inconsistencies
many of the central characters are totally static and poorly motivated and they don't learn anything
or growth of a story so what you're saying is that these characters aren't acting realistic
enough for you what happened when you said that human beings are illogical and imperfect
if unrealistic character actions aren't real criticism then why are unrealistic characters
motivations they go hand in hand their actions are quite literally driven by their motivations
there are real people in the world with unrealistic motivations
just the same as there are real people in the world with unrealistic character actions
by your own logic your complaints are no less subjective than the ones you're criticizing as
illegitimate you could make the exact same arguments against either of those concepts
there are also plenty of great movies that intentionally avoid conforming to the exact
same character growth formula that he's imposing as the standard for how a movie has to be
well your premise is that my criticisms are legitimate but yours aren't you're doing
nothing but harming creativity not every movie has to follow the standard you set for it and
it's incredibly arrogant to imply that your form of criticism is somehow objective here's an idea
that is essential to consider about this situation there are writers and directors out there who put
painstaking efforts into their stories to make sure everything is as concise and logical as possible
there are also writers and directors who don't put in those efforts at all
if inconsistencies and plot and character action don't matter at all
then how can you even appreciate those efforts made by filmmakers who legitimately care
you're not just delegitimizing those who discuss their films you're delegitimizing the filmmakers
themselves you're saying there's no difference between a lazy script littered with inconsistencies
versus a thoroughly researched laid out thoughtful script that made every effort they possibly could
to make the story characters and universe as consistent and believable as possible
that's just nonsense and upset it's upsetting that you refuse to see any value whatsoever in
filmmakers who put those extra efforts into their work i personally don't enjoy cinema sins either
because i personally consider it to be completely substanceless that's an interesting word and
unfunny it's bottom of the barrel criticism where the goal is to find as many ding flaws as possible
often reaching so far as to include ones despite the film very clearly adding those aspects
intentionally if your premise in this video was that going out of your way to find flaws in every
single film that exists while ignoring every other aspect of filmmaking is low effort content
i'd be agreeing with you here however your premise is that taking issue with any amount
of inconsistencies in any film ever is illegitimate and i can't agree with you at all on that you're
seriously delegitimizing the filmmakers out there who actually care about those things
and it sets bad precedent to tell people that their efforts shouldn't be appreciated and then
he drops the microphone boy someone said um uh the video gamer said i can totally see yms making
that argument against molar and co2 i was gonna say this there's plenty of uh ways that me and
yms would disagree i've disagreed with a handful of his criticisms in the past but you cannot deny
that uh that selection there's got a shit ton of criticism for this video that we applied as well
someone says did the little furry doggy not like the fact that patrick was calling people like you
out for call causing the clickbait videos i seem to recall that the right opinion in quinton
reviews called both you and molar out for the same thing oh yeah when are we going to do that
it's we'll get to it once rags stream thingy but uh we we yeah once i can stream basically
yeah um so he's got another video talking about film criticism in general you guys want to check
that out oh um how's it been going for a long time we have what is it's 5 18 um if we can go over it
if we can be quick i want to get some water i i was talking a lot well do you want to go grab
the water now and then we'll do we'll go through i gotta i gotta go pee and go water go don't do
the same at the same time but yes go i'll uh uh someone complained about hella greedo's twitter
behavior he just trolled him instead of answering the points of the random guy you'll never learn
and never improve that's um hella greedo's been very uh passive aggressive on his twitter i found
by following him and i like to follow the people that i tend to disagree with to try and keep track
of what new arguments rise or what perspectives i can consider but i've genuinely found reading
hello greedo's twitter to be very he's like like i said passive aggressive he's very much uh
bitter towards the people who disagree um this is bad comedy uh could you guys do a response
video to major lee's the last jedi review i've not seen it but i mean we've got so many requests now
sort of um rip apart different videos that we try and get through the ones we were what we're
interested in doing first but um obviously there's infinite potential we can cover as many
or as little as there actually is in existence i'm interested in the debate between yms
against molar and wolf about the last jedi i will be more than on board to guest on the
sardonic cast but i don't know if i would be someone they might see is a bit too i don't know
traversal or inflicting we'll have to find out they've not seen anything publicly why they
wouldn't it's just that uh i don't know i i would like to talk to yms that'll be cool
next video is a spicy boy thing for us no how long till rags and dishonor wolf turn you into
a fairy i don't think that's going to happen i can resist it's it'll be fine um jared video next i
i mean i'll probably upload this video on my channel because it's like a response
so i'll keep jared out of it otherwise my subscriber is going to be fucking completely
confused uh they should be able to at least enjoy a response like this a bit of content
because it's been a bit dry on my month of not content month and a half i think it'll be it'll
be nice for them to see i think so we'll stick to just this guy and then we'll try and end it up on
him on a high note uh what do you think of henry kaville as geralt for witcher tv series i think
it could work i don't know i think i think that geralt has a bit too much emotion for henry kaville
maybe we'll find out that he's only had bad directors and that he's got extremely good
acting chops maybe maybe roast cosmonaut friday hour don't worry albedo that'll be taken care of
in in my series this oh and if yms is ever like gonna watch this or anything like shoot us a
holler let us know oh yeah i would totally i would totally talk to you yms if you're actually
ever able to hear this i don't hate you if anybody told you that i don't hate you either
i hate you a little bit is ralph and yms the best new tube keynote i was gonna say
as critics go uh yms and and ralph are certainly above people like this like
ralph and yms actually put out elements of critical thinking to for people to learn from
while this guy is like almost anti-critical thinking he's like against the idea yeah like
i said before normally the problem that people have with they don't think enough and this guy's
problem is that they're too critical about their they consume you could argue his problem is that
they're critical at all like even slightly it's like gosh i guess you're right it's just i think
yms's comment was really good yeah um wolf yeah one guy said um that he just discovered
you mauler like i think today or something or really recently no no just some random guy in the
chat oh and and uh then he said that he discovered rat or no he discovered mauler a week ago he
discovered rags like today yay and i'm just thinking to myself what what would have happened
if they saw that stream where it was responding to the jared responding to rags responding to
it would be like what have i what have i done truly we are renaissance men yeah well uh let's
it's on my channel the gerona janessa let's see if we can like we'll go as far as anybody who
wants to stop all right we'll just see how far we can get with this one and give him bigger gaps
but this is the same guy saying we need to talk about film criticism oh my god oh hey so this week
i want to he's pretending to read things down a little bit and just chat about film critics
and film criticism what the point of it is and what we oh no you're gonna tell me what the point
of criticism is so is this video before or after this was from march yeah this is before the one
we watched so i would love to see i would love to watch this video after watching the dumpster fire
that we just witnessed like if anything doesn't the video we just watched like already invalidate
this this video here as if we can grasp anything consistent i don't because i don't know it's
pretty easy to spot conflict with this guy he says one every other sentence so just like
yeah this one doesn't make sense no this other one exists but i mean that one didn't make sense
on its own so it was stuck in a paradox from it because for a while now i've been noticing some
things that kind of trouble me and i'm not coming here to tell you that you're
but you will dude dude that's that's boy that's getting noted down he said i i've
still got it you're watching movies wrong in quotations i'm just gonna sweet sweet summer
child you will one day tell us that what we're doing is wrong here rags you'll like this so um
when people quote me and rags are saying you aren't allowed to like something they'll always
have to say it they can never actually cite me in rags because we don't actually do that we
don't actually believe that but this guy we can actually say you tell people that you're
watching something wrong and he could be like you can't get a quote and be like we can get a quote
times he said it like this wasn't just a one-off mistake out of contact he said it multiple times
explicitly yms said he doesn't like me oh i like you still unless you are actually wrong about
indisputable facts but just hang on that's our thing that's not your thing that's our thing
but what is an indisputable fact why why care about logic oh yeah right i don't know if he
remember he's probably hasn't he hasn't evolved as a critic yet so how do how do you justify even
using the phrase indisputable fact in a shitty video on august 27th like like legitimately
how would you like what is an indisputable fact exactly oh no for my take on things so
film criticism it's been around pretty much since the beginning of cinema i thought it came around
in 2012 though i can't i kind of plot holes i kind of want to read that out uh from from
cathedral water truthfully coming from a fan of patrick believe it or not i can't help but agree
his new video is just awful i can still enjoy him just me but you guys and yms make excellent
points yeah i'd be surprised if people who are fans of him would be able to defend like everything
he says in the video because it's tough you know obviously we especially after watching this we
went hard on him obviously but like to go easy would still be like you can't agree and it was
only hard on him because of how narrow we were that's why it took hours to go through that dumpster
fire we didn't even go through the whole thing we didn't listen to the sennheiser we probably
could have found inconsistencies well yet well yeah because he opens it up with this video would
not be possible without sennheiser also yeah oh he opens it up with an inconsistency i was
fucking lying to you i like yms by the way if somebody somebody said why don't you like him i
okay i like yms too i would i would shake his hands i hate him fuck what are you ruining it
who cares about you it's the extension of art criticism which has been announced like the 1700s
now right up front i want to clear up some misconceptions yeah but your ability to recognize
people's misconceptions i'm gonna i'm gonna question that art criticism has been around
since the 70s i was like wouldn't it have been around since art was around well i think he said
cinema i think he said art criticism if he's at art cinema i want to clear up some misconceptions
that i know some people have critics are not bought or bribed that's so incorrect critics
are bought or bribed how could you make that point lie that is such a fucking lie we know that's a lie
hey we're gonna is okay we want you to come and watch the new star wars movie direct park
movie here we'll fly you out to orlando and put you in this really nice hotel don't worry about
the bill we'll pay for all that sit in this really cozy chair have all the popcorn and
movies and drinks you want are you comfortable you don't make sure you're good here take this
swag bag full of just to clarify let's let it play until he says point two to make sure that's what
he just said facts but just to offer my take on things so film criticism it's been around pretty
much since the beginning of cinema itself and it's an extension of art criticism which has been
around since like the 1700s so yeah so you said art criticism has been around since 1700s
oh shit you're right he is retarded pretty sure people criticizing art when art began
motherfucker do you know the pope you know how bitchy the pope was about that damn sistine chapel
jesus Christ some goop made a rock and said i like these rock and some of the you're rock
you're rock shitty i hate your rock my rock better it's smoother your rock your rock is gay
wait are we making monday bat jokes i just realized
stop flagging my boulder right up front i want to clear up some misconceptions that i know some
people have critics are not bought are bribed disney does not pay off critics oh i'm sorry dude
make that without immediately being no maybe maybe he's maybe this is the raw man yeah i got
say the critics are not bribed come the fuck on of course they are of course they're wink wink
nudge nudged of course they are i've literally i've literally had company email me and say hey
we want you to review x and yeah and be positive that's a good review someone said i'm really sorry
you lost your job at nasa wolf what what did you hear about that the furry that like started
bragging about being getting an internship at nasa and then she got immediately fired because
she shit talked uh i don't remember what his name is some guy who like oversees nasa
so like her boss's boss's boss's boss's boss i yeah yeah that's don't i just i'm sorry i'm
still reeling from the fact that he just said there there are no critics that are paid for
it's like oh that is so dumb we've got so much evidence that that's not the case
i just that's incredible to trash dc movies it's not like bad reviews hurt suicide squads box
office so why would studios a waste i don't watch movies if the reviews are bad i was about to say
what the hell do you mean people literally cite reviews as why they don't go to see a film if it's
bad that's a thing that's a thing that happens if i hear that a movie's bad i don't go and see it
if i hear that a movie's really good i'm much more likely to see it i mean it's like it's very simple
logic all right no logic you can't do that put it away like you can say that maybe review doesn't
necessarily make or break a movie in some cases but geez to just say that it doesn't affect it is
ridiculous i don't believe that but i guess such a stupid thing just money on that i mean sure they
would like good reviews because it helps with marketing but no critics are you just why admit
reason why they would do it what do you think marketing is my brain reviews don't matter but
they want good reviews because marketing there's no reason why they would do it other than positive
marketing i suppose other than you know advertisement reasons so people will still see the film i'm
really bothered by the fact that his hair looks like he's wearing one of those stupid little jewish
hats i don't know what he's i don't i think you should yeah i think he needs to just own it and
go bold at this point that's what i do it looks like it's gone a bit too far back now i mean i like
that i'm bald just take it off man like my hair is thinning to the point where it's like i know
in a couple years i'll have to go bald but at least i got a beard yeah he's got something
did you shave that shit off just go jason statham or whatever it's fine there's another
yeah jason's cool this guy less cool but no no he's not bad at actually being paid off by studios
he keeps saying that like it's a ridiculous idea when we've got proof that it's happened
he i don't understand it's like you guys silly people you think that there's actual
murders in real life you think people actually kill people it's illegal why would they do that
he's like a game journalist trying to like getting defensive about his own industry in a way
to echo yms from earlier he made a big argument for how humans are illogical and emotional and
though he's trying to make an argument for how it's illogical to do what humans are doing
that he's trying you understand what i'm saying right i get what i get with you i'm i'm buying
what you're saying if you just remember the last minute of footage from this guy he'll just have
you won't be able to follow because you just be like wait but didn't you say and he's like that's
logic stop using that's nonsense critics are not an amorphous entity that all conspire together
with one single opinion so when someone complains about the critics they really mean hundreds of
individual people all with their own unique opinions and critics i don't understand what
they can all have unique opinions but they can still be paid off and they can express that in
their own way i know i i just i'm just like okay not sure where he's going with that point
because it i don't know it's don't yeah i agree do you actually think that black panther is 98%
really like really do you think that movie is so fucking amazing that 98% of first off
good luck getting 98% of anybody to agree on anything let alone let alone how good a film was
and the only one that lowered the score was like there wasn't fights that's the furthest thing
from being a criticism of that movie and they were outraged the the the community behind black
panther would genuinely outraged and the problem i had with it i was like you guys are outraged
that he lowered it because of a stupid fight criticism but you are okay with the film being
100% yeah there's nothing if if 100 if i got a video that had likes on it something's fucking
wrong anybody doesn't like you just died somehow i don't like it i don't like it this ain't genuine
this ain't right this ain't the truth feel like monday man buying it with likes just like he's
buying his subscribers rags buying anti-dislikes exposed rags there's negative dislikes on it we're
like wait which dude rags the atheist vote mods upvoting my videos they have to watch every movie
that comes out so you genuinely have to love movies you just say the critics have to watch
every movie that comes out no i think you i think you said that you have to love watching and
critics do not hate everything they have to watch every movie that comes out so they do not have to
watch every movie that comes out why who said that critics hate everything dude he has to respond to
straw bed because otherwise common misconceptions i've never heard anybody say that critics hate
everything if anything critics like a lot of really bad things what i'll say is we should
just try and keep pushing to see if we can find some like insane thing he says because this stuff
is just again it's just yeah it's wrong but like it's nowhere near as bad as his hatred of logic
say that there's no paid-off reviewers or anything that's pretty fucking insane it is insane it's
undeniably insane but it's also as insane as saying logic is evil sort of thing not that he
said that i'm paraphrasing of course you genuinely have to love movies if you want to do that job
critics are not limsey duncan from birdman cruelly determined to take down something they haven't even
seen okay so we're clear on that critics are not evil are corrupt clear thanks not clear at all
thanks for letting people know i'm not evil dude are a huge single-minded being great let's move on
quick disclaimer in this video i'm referring to critics specifically as the people who regularly
review new movies so while i make not video essayists what if video essayists cover new movies
yeah if anything why would i why would i not prefer a video essayist i'm confused
who just writes a column do me and wolf count as reviewers or a video essayists when we release our
videos like my rages and his media reloads or be reloaded or the the reviews themselves is it length
why are those exclusive to one another i don't even know because an essay right an essay is
just words on a script in in a form you know like consistently moving from one point in the
next you can call a lot of things an essay yeah and so there's something video essay what is that
it's like well it's the essay then spoken out into a video that's well that is um help i don't
understand where he's going with this i don't i don't some videos that are technically film
criticism i don't count as a film critic i've never done a review before i did a survey on
twitter the other day where i am jesus christ i um how do you what genuinely people who like
this guy's stuff how do you follow what he's saying i cannot follow this yeah i don't get it
lost completely i i actually have to kind of hear that again someone said this guy would love the
wicker man just for the size of the straw man in it okay okay i'm gonna i'm i gotta hear this again
this is legitimately being great let's move on quick disclaimer in this video i'm referring to
critics specifically as the people who regularly review new movies so while i make some videos
that are technically film criticism i don't count as a film critic i've never it's fucking nonsense
i'm not even kidding why why i i perform film criticism but i am not a film critic
you really need to just drop a barrel of water onto your face and wake the fuck up about what
weirds he doesn't consider that he doesn't consider that water it's only water if you
look at it through read a response it's a massive hydrogen and oxygen particles bound together
to create a clear tasteless liquid doesn't mean it's not someone said make a note you are
absolutely right i need to actually remember which videos these are even from we need to
talk about film criticism that's where it is this is this is who is this guy and why do people
listen to this guy jesus christ like the sith deal in logic this is the most vapid nonsense i've
i don't i i criticize movies but i'm not a film critic also video essayists don't count because
reasons and well i guess he is right logic doesn't exist why fuck it unless see how this
this where this rabbit hole go there's so many of these people on youtube by the way and they're so
popular and it just makes you wonder what is what is what is what do people like about it
is it his presentation is it that he sounds really interesting and that's enough is this
like the is this the kind of content that you turn on in the background just so you feel like
you're not alone in the room done a review before i did a survey on twitter the other day where i
asked people who their favorite critics are and i was kind of shocked at the answers probably more
than half the critics mentioned are youtube film critics why would that surprise oh he's gonna he's
gonna he's gonna bring in education official oh if he fucking does that'll be jesus fucking christ
because we're amateurs remember that we're amateurs but i was like why would you be surprised that in
2018 going on twitter and asking who your favorite movie critics are they're not going to talk about
people who are on newspaper columns and internet blog sites not only that they're going to talk
about youtuber viewers not only that he's a youtuber and he's asking no no no he's not a
film critic no no he's not a youtuber like we are he's a youtuber because he's left film school
and become a youtube person on the side he's an intellectual we are just filthy amateurs
wait for it yeah but i'm not saying that he's a film creator or anything like that he's a youtuber
because he makes videos and uploads into you absolutely he's a youtuber fan base
what's their favorite critics are and since they are a youtube fan base don't you think that
they're gonna go to youtube to look oh good point yeah it's pretty stupid to ask the internet who
their favorite film critics are especially on twitter because people promote twitters through
youtube but it's just like yeah your fan base is constructed of people from youtube you're asking
youtube fans who their favorite critics are they're probably going to pick youtube and it's just a
matter of in this day and age that's i mean youtube is such a huge platform to change it up
that's where everyone is of course that's where people's critics are if you went to a series of
old folks homes and asked them who their favorite film critics were i doubt as many youtubers would
show up there in this election if they had a selection that would be oh that man in the
paper every saturday morning he talks about the new superhero movies that's my old lady also i'm
sure he's friends uh with other youtubers you know what fuck it let's let the criticism come
out here i'm just we're assuming a bit here and a lot of people said that they don't follow any
critics who write traditional like written reviews traditional this really concerned me
why is criticism more or less valid because it is written down instead of spoken in a youtube
hey man all he said is it concerns him we're fine we're fine he hasn't said anything too bad yet
let's step back for a minute and talk about what the purpose of film criticism is anyway
the first part of that answer this seems like a really strange i don't want him to say whatever
he says is going to be really boxed in and it's going to be bad brace for impact um breaking my
asshole's clench time bro is easy it's to guide us in our decisions about what movies to see
our view should give us an idea of what a movie is and whether the critic thinks it's worth seeing
that's obvious but there's a second component to criticism in douglas martin's obituary for roger
ebert in the new york times he wrote not only did he advise moviegoers about what to see but also
how to think about what i don't want credit i don't want critics telling me what i'm supposed
to think about what i see yeah that's not a good thing especially if that's not a good thing if
somebody wrote that about my obituary i would i would force ghosts lightning them um yeah this
is the other problem as well there's been an evolution easily of reviews and critics critiques
and stuff you know my new video on the force awakens i would never say it's it's gonna tell
i'm through my video i'm telling you whether or not you should see the force awakens no
i'm expecting you to have watched it to be able to understand my video better my video is supposed
to deconstruct the film and talk about writing that's that's my purpose as a as a critic i've
the idea that you think that it is a critic's job to teach you how to think or what you're supposed
to think about something why would you want people to tell you that in a in a here's here's how you
should think about it well this is basically setting the stage for what he says in august
there's a right way to watch a movie and there's a wrong way to watch a movie
this is basically that idea expanded upon or this is this is the progenitor to that idea
that's i think this is only gonna go worse they saw it's that second part that i think
it's overlooked too often a critic should have a deep knowledge and understanding of cinema
it's history but shut up about plot holes no no he's wrong uh a critic doesn't have absolutely
any requirements other than they criticize they could be inaccurate they would still be a critic
joe schmoe off the street could offer more insightful criticism than any fucking degree
that you wasted your money on yeah it's possible which means the rule has to encompass it you can't
say you cannot be a critic unless you have x y and z it's like nope as long as you have a brain
and you're able to use words like as long as you understand the language you're using you're good
to go does your criticism stand up to scrutiny it doesn't matter who's saying it it doesn't matter
where it's from it doesn't matter what medium it is presented in it doesn't matter if it's written
down if it's spoken aloud if it is being fucking if it's on a fucking morse code it doesn't matter
the things that are being said are what's important and remember what i said earlier about the whole
new guard old guard critic thing i think i was right this video's really what when yms said
that other video was the leadest boy and how it works and they should bring that perspective to
the review not just telling us if the movie is good or bad but deepening our understanding of it
tell igm that well here's the thing he referenced a character from birdman i've never seen that movie
so how does that help me as a criticism yeah he's he's he's the video essayist so he's supposed
to be the one that's even more thorough and interesting like this character from this movie
and but i haven't seen that character from that movie so that doesn't help me at all you might as
well not have said anything that doesn't help me at all yeah you'd think you'd go with a more
mainstream movie than birdman i mean i've seen birdman but i mean that's that's kind of a niche
movie did you go yeah but but he has a solid understanding of film history so he can make a
reference and you're just supposed to take him at his word for it which i'm not prepared to do with
this guy um general suite said and mola doesn't do that what the fuck i'm curious what you think
that we've just criticized him for that i do and for anybody wondering what i'm going to do with
this video more than likely going to upload it on my channel because i figure it works as a as a
deconstruction this one's too long for me to upload yeah i think i think my fans will want to
hear this like they'll find it entertaining i suppose but um yeah uh just give it a few more
seconds see if that guy qualifies what what i pulled a parachute at the last second um giving
us things to think about that we otherwise might not have noticed or considered this for me is the
problem with most youtube film critics they're predominantly straight white male oh come on oh no
he did it oh no he's got he's ticking all the boxes dude sexuality race and gender
what do you know your race and your gender is a problem you know i in the last video i was like
this guy kind of strikes me as like the real far leftist post-modernist communist supporting guy
but i didn't want to say it but he's pretty much confirmed it now and it's like oh okay
well now that just informs everything doesn't it i mean you're you're mauler you're straight
you're white you're male i'm the worst one out of all of us i'm the devil you guys have got
something you know at least to me and regs have like some social justice points in our pocket
yeah at least i'm not now at least i'm bisexual what if i rip off my own legs and then i'm in
a wheelchair does that you're disabled uh you still have white privilege and male privilege
but you're not as ableist so you get what you get a little step up in the totem pole i can do trans
though at any moment i can't just say that i'm right you can yeah you can that's true all right
still right to deny you your identity but here's the thing that you guys need to take away from
this or that i take away from this you know if you have if you are concerned or if you have if
you're concerned about critics being straight white and male that means that it's a problem
it is a problem that a lot of reviewers are straight and white and male that's a bad thing
oh god he's a queer as a film critic same uh so yeah that's yeah well there's your
what a shame what a shame that he said that because you can i feel like if you devolve to
that point it's like why can't you make arguments why do you have to resort to race it feels so odd
being the side that says it you know well it's like the person the gender that this person likes to
fuck that really has a lot to do with their criticism of this movie yeah you're bringing
politics into the disappointed by how many people upvoted this video this is 20 well we got it we
got to pub through it there's your insane quote and i find their views to be pretty shallow
they'll tell you does he think mine is shallow well you're straight white and male so he's
already got a problem i cover every line of dialogue it's like what did i miss and he's
like you miss the deeper themes you miss the themes about uh failure team you had
well your straight white maleness keeps you from understanding it through reader response theory
so pain just pain that the acting was great or the jokes didn't all land or i was on the edge
of my chair it is an example of a human default but they hardly ever dig any deeper but clearly
a lot of people are cool with that and i'm not saying you're wrong i'm not saying you're right
you you've literally did it's too it's too late yes you are so you've already done that in your
other video if you could snap your fingers and change it you absolutely would oh yeah someone's
just brought up rogerie but he was a straight white male oh he was one of the good ones he was
an ally he was we converted him is what he would argue i'm sure i guess for enjoying them the
traditional view of film critics is older people like roger ebert pauling i don't know those i
mean i know roger ebert but i know ebert i don't know the other oh yeah no i never i've never
got who are film experts who are like authorities okay wait wait that is a fallacy what makes them
film authorities exactly and why does that mean why does that mean anything
why so is is his point that whatever they review said is more accurate because they are the one
who said them because that's an argument from authority you should never have to argue your
authority if your argument is solid it shouldn't need that you shouldn't need to go hey
i am this thing therefore what i said is more true now it's like don't need to do that if it's
a solid logic would be pulling out his non-existent hair right now we heard that oh right oh yeah well
this oh yeah well thomas aquinas said it so god has to be real yeah we just need to we need to find
a critic from the stone age so they can outdo everyone because they were the og critic
i'm telling you man my rock is better than your rock do you reckon monday night would be
in contact with anybody because they are like of the bolder sort of society i would imagine
the bolder clan the bolder society but now because the internet has democratized opinions
and film culture a lot of people especially younger people want critics who are kind of like
friends someone of a similar age and demographic okay keep going he's not made a point yet even oh
i mean i guess he has made a point but it's retarded maybe they do maybe they don't who cares
yeah i don't see how it's relevant yeah with similar interests and tastes who will tell them
yeah it's awesome or no it sucks now i don't think a critic needs to yeah i disagree i've
already got people in my fan base who said they really enjoyed black panther but they still liked
my video it's like it's rare to be because i shit on it so they don't they don't watch my stuff to
get their opinions validated they're watching it just to see me deconstruct film yeah i think
when people people want to see the robot people want to people want to test what they like against
the robot so this this idea because there are some people out there sure who are like i like
this guy because he said everything i think they exist sure but stop with the sweeping statements
so boring work for a major publication for their opinion to matter but the qualifications for most
youtube critics seems to just be having seen the dark knight at least five you know
okay uh why don't we just talk about how just writes couldn't hold up against me talking about
a film despite citing all of his history and who's who's taught him what books he's read and
my my citation for my history is i've watched way too many films and that's it i've never been
taught film theory the um the the yeah and just right did the big comments ate him up he performed
very poorly it's like um why is it that a random schmoe managed to outwit somebody about writing
who's been taught it professionally it's like oh is it because education doesn't necessarily mean
you're smarter than someone else how many youtube atheists have made responses to these official
theologians with degrees and when they dropped didn't stuff didn't ej the amazing atheists he
dropped out of high school didn't he i don't know i'm not certain yeah he did so but it's just i'm
just a guy and i like logic and i'm gonna make a character um and i'm gonna go after these people
who have spent their entire lives devoted to the subject but i'm going to win because i'm a good
critical thinker well kylar said just right argued against the premise of his own channel
and he did he did that's why it's really funny this is good writing but good writing isn't
actually a thing it's like okay fair i did too and look before you comment about it i'm not counting
bob chiffman among the other youtube film critics because he basically just writes traditional
written reviews and then turns them into videos and look of course you shouldn't count him because
he's fucking insane he is insane but the his he doesn't have any standard here he's just saying
stuff he's like okay so you review every film that comes out you don't do it in a way that's
like you criticize film as a whole it has to be individual movies it's also about how in depth of
the movie you go but it's more about being traditional like you write out the reviews
sort of but also bob chiffman he's okay because he puts it into it's just rambling at this point
what's the justification for who's bob chiffman he's the movie bob i don't know what he's gonna
i've only ever watched his videos to see what crazy shit he says next he is insane like what
what is the things he said like look what like bob chiffman literally has complained that the nazis
gave eugenics a bad reputation a recent a recent quote from bob chiffman uh whether or not ethically
james gunn shouldn't be directing guardians of the galaxy 3 you cannot prevent him from doing
that because it gives a win to the nazis what he is like he is a super social justice warrior and
he's fucking insane it's there's no logic it's just funny like movie bob like i said i've only
ever watched his videos just to be like what does he say at next oh here we go it's insane
his twitter feed is a is a spiral into just yeah it is it is something else man stay far away
yeah and he's convinced that like anybody on the alt right they're nazis and they need to be stopped
like he's convinced that anyone anyone's a nazi pretty much anyone of those people like basically
anybody's a nazi you didn't like the last jedi you're a nazi i was still trying to piece together
the whole eugenics thing because i'm like how do you get because he's insane like he wants to
control like who can vote because a lot of uneducated white trash people don't vote the
right way you know like he literally he wants to like he wants to control who gets to vote stuff
like that like he's insane thing is he's a crazy authoritarian it's literally what happens when you
think that your ideology is going to save the world you have to do everything you can to get
it one h bomber guy is the same way i was gonna i can't remember if i told you guys but like i
follow his twitter and people are talking about how you shouldn't be using the recent shooting
to push an agenda and h bomber guy responded saying if your agenda will protect people from
this very thing then you should be pushing it during these events like let's put it this way
movie bob could be if you gave movie bob the infinity gauntlet there would like no like there
there would be no republicans or conservatives like he would he would actually snap his fingers
and make them all disappear like he's he's actually he would do that yeah it's it's as
somebody who tries to watch everybody from all over the aisle movie bob's been pretty crazy like
i i remember because i was doing something in my room and i was listening to his guardians
three james gun video and i remember being like what the fuck is he saying i was like this is
this real and i was like oh this is just standard for him he just he constantly says nazis by the
way it's like i think he calls the right just nazis i don't even know if he i mean at this
point when someone tells me someone is a nazi or an alt writer it's like i don't even pretend to
take you seriously anymore you guys don't believe me by default is i don't believe you know i mean
i've been called an alt writer so often that it's like yeah it's like it doesn't mean anything
anymore yeah you know what they do they kill wids they they depower wids by using them so much
and then stop using specific words that they want to depower it's like and to be fair hilarious irony
i don't know so i was i just wanted to hear basically why he doesn't count movie bob
all right i did too and look before you comment about it i'm not counting bob chiffman among the
other youtube film critics because he basically just writes traditional written reviews and then
turns them into videos and look of course that doesn't make any fucking sense at all but sure
that seems really cherry picky well uh you know he just adds in to but i'm not going to talk about
that it's like if anything movie bob does put work into some of his videos so you're i guess that
make this qualifies him because he didn't just leave it at a script it's just it's just note
the buzzword it's traditional he didn't have to explain it because traditional traditional
traditional traditional that's what traditional is everyone knows what traditional is he does
traditional moving on of course i use reviews to determine what movies i'm going to see i have my
own list of critics i respect whose opinions didn't you just say didn't you just say earlier there is
no reason why anybody would pay off critics and you've just admitted you only watch films based
on reviews you have no self-awareness you don't remember what happened a minute ago that's it
just ends this is insane it is partly based my film viewing on but that's not where the
role of i mean you should probably quote that as well i'm going to go back to roger very bad
what one now that he literally says that oh i have a couple of uh critics that i based my
viewers i thought i thought you meant for my april fools thing because i'm not going to make
a video on this guy this is the video on this guy if you know what i mean like this is yeah and it's
just like a it's just so blatant a contradiction people don't see movies because of reviews
but i do that i mean it's just it's that black and white it's that fucking black and white
it's so dumb it's just no self-awareness none maybe he doesn't listen to himself because he's
a straight white male most famous and quite possibly the best film critic we've ever had
and pulled a quote from him he says why do we why do i care what this person says
it's like why do i care what the bible says it's like i just can't you just tell me yourself also
you know why do we need critics it's just like uh we'll have critics no matter what
because humans are that way you you won't be you won't lack for critics ever humans have opinions
we all want to shit on and celebrate stuff that is what we do yeah we need critics i don't believe
readers buy a newspaper to read variations in the line you are correct sir and yeah they do
there's plenty of people who do that yeah there do you think people only watch cnn yeah cnn and
fox news that's the whole premise they tell their viewers they are correct that's it that's what news
is now is like here's the here's this spin on this here's that spin on that you want to hear
the right spin you want to hear the left spin that's what it is i guess newspaper film
production encourage critical thinking introduce new developments consider the local scene this is
what they should do and and look and look at what's happening to newspapers also i just love
encourage critical thinking it's like i thought we were against the whole logic thing or does that
not count is critical thinking and logic dissimilar well maybe maybe he's it's it's like the it's like
the wrong way right way to see a movie you like the ideas are in his head but he hasn't i guess
he's not bold enough or he hasn't quite formulated them well enough to where he can blatantly say
them out loud they're still in their infant stage but you could definitely see this video
months before the other one where you know these things are festering oh yeah this guy is this guy
hates youtube critics i think the ones that don't agree with him i mean like this guy he's
the game journalist version of a movie critic i'm a movie critic version of a game journalist yeah
yeah it's because he likes i guess bob chipman and whoever else because they probably say
things about movies he likes but the other ones they're the non-traditional ones burn them at the
stake voice specials but but the most telling things he said is the whole straight white male
thing is like it's such a it's such an open window into his mindset oh god yeah we shouldn't
need to reference that ever during film criticism or film criticism criticism straight white males
like mauler be a weatherman on social trends bring in a larger context teach inform amuse inspire
be heartened be outraged i'm sorry but i can't even say that fox news doesn't do those things
because the people who are watching it feel that that is happening he's talking about emotional
stuff there be outraged be heartened be inspired of course fox news and cnn are capable of that
so yeah the left is outraged by it the right are inspired by them cnn does the opposite it's just
it's a lovely statement but it means nothing because everything can and can't do that
at this point maybe the best thing he can do is say things that don't mean anything
this is not digging the hole deeper and this to me is the difference between most youtube
film critics and the best traditional critics oh you did not just say the best don't use that
word especially not you dude we're not gonna i mean can you give me examples also traditional
again please tell us what that means does it mean old does it mean came from the 1900s
people ones on youtube thing is people people don't they don't name names it's like who is the
standard who is the best who is who is one of these these people that you're referring to i'm
assuming he's gonna say rogerie but it would be one of them i don't know well even people on
youtube he's like he it's weird that he would specifically talk about bob chipman yes as not
being an example but he wouldn't mention any other youtuber because bob chipman isn't normally a name
that pops up with sane people as a good video critic so it's weird that he gets a name mention
but no one else is yeah yeah that's so weird that he's nobody else has been named yeah you're
right in this whole video so far yeah it's it's very ambiguous it's very oh i wasn't referring to
him yeah i don't know it's his back door it's the ambiguity is his defense oh i didn't mean that
person i meant someone else who i will not name but that's who i'm talking about that other person
traditional critics the ones on youtube tend to offer the viewer's own perspective back to them
but the really good that is so horseshit i would defend even just right and quinton against that
criticism they don't just offer people back their own credit their own perspective they are they
genuinely they they have their own thoughts and feelings dude wow i was uh i thought mauler was a
black skull on wheels that's why i agree unconditional wheels yeah you're like a hot wheels car man
look at you the end line in the wheels and the skull one of those you're like one of the uh
what did jared have on his wall the uh hot wheels yeah yeah the hot wheels yeah man jared's been a
fan of you since time immemorial man you need you need to ask like quinton reviews and all these
crazy people what they think about this guy um so a friend of mine suggested would i say that about
chris stuckman being sort of because chris stuckman is kind of the boogie of film reviews um even him
i would defend against this the idea that uh they're not offering how they actually feel
they're only trying to feed into their own audiences i'd be like you can't know that dude
like we it's a bit much because even i would rather just criticize their actual arguments show
them to be making double standards in order to try and appeal to the mass audience instead of just
going all critics on youtube are pretty much just trying to tell people how those people feel to
appeal i mean half the time you're gonna you know line up with people anyway if i came up
with my own perspective and then some guy goes i feel the exact same way does this guy say yeah
he did that by design what did he say that's a coincidence what does he what does he think about
this video here because like people like this video is arguably more garbage than the last one
but most people have uploaded it for some crazy reason i mean don't you just i mean don't don't
audience it don't you generally build an audience around people that agree apparently he he negatively
cites angry joe in another video in relation to this and again if you were trying to argue that
he's an illegitimate film illegitimate film critic angry joe i'd say like no because the
definition of critic means you criticize pretty much it nobody's got the fucking prestigious title
of critic you know since when was that a thing it's just some guy who criticizes that's all you
need to do who gets to decide who is and isn't the critics you know like just to clarify critic
define is there actually anything to it a person who expresses an unfavorable opinion of something
a person who judges the merits of literary or artistic works especially one who does so
professionally so what you're talking about is a nazi i love the word professionally as well
because it literally just means you make money from it don't you it's like the day that you
monetize your videos you become a professional yeah i'm i'm a professional critic bite me but
yeah i hate the gatekeeping on this why mr's right he's just this guy is like this is what this is
and this is what this isn't by who just like thanks dude he's like do these are the people who
would if they could actually be you know they would decide who gets to you know it's like these
are the people that are out there that are the reason why people are afraid of you know censorship
and content and stuff it's people like this who want to control that kind of and he makes a point
about how what should be done is exploring critical thinking and inspiring people stuff
it's like by it from me his videos are doing the complete opposite and you're making it harder for
people to learn and grow by telling them all of this garbage but you know they're gonna have to
learn it for themselves i suppose like everybody is different me me and rags could have watched
this video separately before we even met and hated it together but then the mother guy watches
it and goes this is this is accurate i like this that's that then someone in the chat said that
this guy liked alien covenant said it was great he liked the last jedi dude he said it was great
i yeah i guess i shouldn't be surprised but i just keep thinking about alien covenant and i'm like
nothing good comes to mind why do you think that films like paul blart get a sequel
oh people like this guy
i forgot that paul blart ever happened he's a hero he's the shrek in real life
he's also an answer in real life
all for more i want to read critics who really know their shit whose opinions are there i agree
with that this movie bob i was gonna say what in the world makes you confirm they know their
shit what is it that what's the key factor is it when they go um the film projector used in 1974
called the remington 776 was actually used on set in this film to create same style of shot
and he's just like that guy knows this film that guy knows this film i guess i don't know there
doesn't there's no standard here it's very pick and choose and there's no there's no line that set
there's no standard that's given i think i think kylar is right you need to open any of your videos
by showing what degrees you've achieved what what professors the professors have taught you and what
books you have read once you've done that you're allowed to criticize yeah it raises the max amount
of subscribers you're allowed to have so that we don't get we don't get those uppity amateurs
getting popular so only the people with proper college degrees get to be popular i love the idea
that we're having like a discussion about the last jedi me and him and then i'm like so you know
holders plan doesn't make quite sense with both and then he's like i'm i'm sorry well what is your
education i'm just like what he's like i will continue this conversation with you if you haven't
been educated i'm sorry also are you a white male like no you should start your next videos
like that hello my name is mauler i am a level three critic i have read four books once i read
five i will be a level five that's uh how that works and we're not are educated and come from
a real understanding of how film works oh i love the buzzwords a real understanding of how films
work because we don't want people watching movies the wrong way a real understanding do
you love this guys like what the fuck does that mean i would love to sit down with him and say
just so what does all that mean that you said i would i would love to hear you that i'm i am
all ears just for you he's like what i mean is like an actual human because the others did ghosts
attaching themselves to pc's and you're like oh makes most sense now i am a disembodied head
i'm just speaking about a skull with wheels dude
literally two attached to me and i just flop over i'm like i don't know why they attached two wheels
but you need at least three the back of the skull weighs you down and then you just kind of
draggin for a while don't tell me this film is gorgeously shot tell me why it's shot that way
and that's the criticism i would levy at you like you keep telling us things and they're not
qualifying them that's that's you just full of shit what purpose it serves so here's a quote from
film critic matt zoller sites talking about film criticism he says movies and television are visual
art forms and oral art forms they are not just about plot characters oh my god why is it always
this movies and television are visual art forms not about plot characterization and theme so
whenever you're writing a story all you need to do is scribble little lines because everybody will
just be there visual art forms oral art forms i'm assuming that's the word for hearing it you
know relating to the sense or to the ear the sense of hearing yeah um this is just sad whenever
someone does this they're basically trying to devalue how important plot characterization and
theme are even though didn't he literally say in his last video that the only things that matter
about judging uh batman for superman where how much the characters grew and what they did in
the film and how flat they were and he's got characterization right there is just that's not
what the film is about have we got like a hypocrite meter because i feel like we're
hitting at least 100 we should celebrate it did it i'm gonna have to do something fun to get my
mind off of it you know what i'm gonna you know what i have to do after this i'm gonna go i need
to do i need to go get groceries that's way more fun than listen i'm gonna scroll up and down the
island pick out my zucchinis and corn and my broccoli and my chicken and my steaks and i'm
gonna spend all night figuring out what all this death note mangas like since ero was like all
right you gotta watch you gotta watch death note and i'm like okay i'll buy the whole manga today
oh you will close your youtube channel and you will think on becoming a real critic
level six level six at least well i i'm sure i'll find that figure out how to be a real critic
and death note so this guy should see this theater analytical writing about movies and tv should
incorporate some discussion of the means by which the plot is advanced the characters developed the
theme didn't we already cover that when we said the holdo being stupid advances the plot and he
was like mm-hmm that's good that's good writing yep yep because sometimes people do a logical
thing so the temporary sanity plea is a defense it's totally reasonable to be illogical well it's
not impossible for her to have temporary insanity therefore it happened off screen she was hitting
the head with a hammer yes she hit her head on the the bulkhead she it should devote some space some
small bit of the word count to the compositions the cutting the music the decor the lighting
so he said so there's people he's mentioned previously like angry joe for example can you
actually say that angry joe's never talked about the composition the cutting the music the decor
the lighting the overall rhythm the mood of the piece or the characterization or the visual
movie basically what i'm trying to say is that like he's putting forth that this is probably
what you should do as a critic and that it's implied that all youtube people don't and i'm
just sitting here like possibly no the overall rhythm and mood of the piece otherwise it's all
just book reports or political op-eds that happen to be about film and tv it's literary criticism
about visual media it's only achieving half of its potential if that boy and it's doing nothing
to help i'm not following it all there's so many different ways i could criticize this it's it's
literary criticism about visual media okay so why is it worse that a youtuber makes visual
criticism about visual media if anything this should prove why youtube videos are better than
just a column in a newspaper traditional criticism if anything else that's what i'm this this point
to me oh seems to be going against your video someone's just highlighted he's like otherwise
it's all political op-eds it's like you just said the movie bob doesn't count and what are
you saying that he doesn't do political op-eds really yeah and don't tell me that the whole
straight white male thing doesn't have political yeah he's already done that's totally unbiased
seriously this might actually be the most hypocritical youtuber i've ever seen he's
con like just these two videos it's like he's two people and they've never met
the viewer said he calls himself the terence malloc of youtube i don't know who that is i
don't know who that insider so i didn't know if one of the viewers who knew that he calls himself
the jarred genesis of film criticism no no but malloc sounds super woke uh in any event i this
this guy the way i mean you have to understand that to say that it's bad that critics are straight
white males like this guy's a racist like he literally is attaching value to your opinion
based on your race like this guy like that's an that's actually racism oh you can't be racist
towards white people rags like just just just to remind everybody that this is this this guy's
actually racist and sexist how dare you that's homophobic that's because we we've diluted that
phrase a lot but when you actually assigned value to people's opinions based on their race
and their gender that that's racism well to me that sounds like a criticism and have you actually
had education on criticism ranks because if you haven't then that was irrelevant and he doesn't
need to listen to that criticism well yeah it's a code lit up to criticize humans the criticism
of humans course before you could criticize him oaks particular feelings in them as they watch it
it is not necessary for a critic of film or television to have created a work of film or
television he's quadruple idea to know a little bitty teensy teensy bit about so if a critical
statement you don't have to create a film or piece of television to be able to critique it
but you should it's never about it's i want to see this guy's movies then i would i would love to
see this guy's it's it's a common like criticism trope right it's like why don't you try and make
something better and it's like just because i can't make something even remotely as good as the
thing i'm criticizing doesn't mean i can't criticize it give me one third the budget of
the last jedi and i'll get out yeah i was gonna say it wouldn't be too hard to make a better film
than last jedi if you give me all of the resources ryan johnson had seriously i mean look at movies
look at movies like the road that's a low budget movie and really really good same with the gray
i can easily make a movie that's fairly low budget significantly less than and the last jedi
you can't make us you can't make us use the first draft just because he did that was his choice
we get to redraft okay yeah we get to actually think about what we're writing
i know it's unfair because ryan johnson just in these discussions talking about alternative ways
to tell the story then we've we've done that like we know we can do it because we've done that
oh why not how we did um he just tweeted to those claiming i'm being hypocritical for calling
someone else's views elitist it's hardly elitist to make claims arguing towards my own experience
watching a film it's incredibly elitist to make claims arguing against someone else's experience
watching the film i reckon you should just hang out with us you would have fun agree with us about
this guy as opposed to dealing with people disagree with him i think hey i'm gonna tell him
i'm gonna say you should stream with us sometime you should you should tell him we read out his
comment as a as a respect totally well i wanted to get him on the podcast at some point this year
next one's gonna be with command so you can't come on the next next you should yeah that spot's
reserved film and television are made i mean nuts and bolts why the fuck are you reading out
this entire goddamn essay from someone who isn't you like why don't you just yeah i want to know
what you think because your opinions are both shitty and amusing i'm assuming he agrees with
all of this otherwise he wouldn't be reading it out but it contradicts what he said i know that's
not new yes it isn't maybe that's why he's reading it out where the camera goes and why it goes there
why a scene included a lot of over-the-shoulder shots of a character speaking even though the
angle prevents you from seeing their lips moving why a particular scene was played entirely yeah
i get it and close up or entirely in long shot basic stuff and building on that with film
criticism i think it's essential to read perspectives different from your own really he's
going yeah he's your age race again i think you guys should really explore other perspectives
than your restricted narrow-minded own my favorite my favorite movie doesn't have a single
white person in it like i don't even i don't even understand if you're a 20-something white dude and
you only watch reviews by 20-something white dude critics what the fuck do you just keep saying
they're white you prick what the hell does it have to do with anything god you're not going to
learn much read reviews by women and people of color read reviews by critics how about i read
reviews from people that actually know what i want to read reviews from people who are
intelligent that is my choice i don't give a shit what race they are mate like yeah no no because
when i go to reviews i get a few minutes in and then i'm like oh maybe i should go further i do
my research i find out who they're sexually attracted to what their race is if they're male
or female and that determines whether or not i keep watching or if i subscribe because i
i ain't subscribing to no darky so it's so backward what he's he just doesn't even
doesn't even realize it he's just like yeah this is totally normal you shouldn't be uh listening
to white people alone as if we know as well half the fucking critics on youtube don't have
face cam so like i give a shit who it is what if i'm an Ashkenazi Jew i thought we advocated
for bob chipman he's a white male and who did i try to bring out onto the screen stream to see if
he was around yms is a white male i just realized oh this is a white male so we can't bring him on
we cannot bring him up i don't know if weekend warrior is a white male but if he is we cannot
bring him on oh thank christ i think we can mauler you and i were both on world-class bullshitters
and he wasn't white he yeah and he has a black friend i'm pretty sure and you have a black friend
how many points have we gotten now well look somebody got fringy on the stream and somebody
check our privilege i can't remember yeah he's green yeah he's green he's green how many green
people have you seen how many you do you have admittedly for tears of white male but he's
swedish so that's that's a form of minority right that's something brown soon it don't matter
i'm half Spanish too oh saved
i'm kind of i'm Hungarian so that helps movies and read reviews by people you disagree
so Richard Brody is the chief film critic why do i care he's incredibly smart he's a great writer
i agree with you so hard right now everyone knows more about film than you like there's this guy
it's like oh here we go it's like okay why should i care this guy said this that means it's true
thank you for watching please subscribe check out square space probably gonna be it and he knows
more about film than i probably ever will that's i also barely ever agree with him on anything
a couple years ago he wrote an article about how just about all the star wars movies are bad
except for the prequels which he considers to be triumphs of cinema how could you possibly think
that is um triumphs of cinema how delusional could you possibly be
yeah i certainly a lot of money maybe that's what he means
whatever with this the focus of this is to to assess this man's perspective
instead of the person he's just mentioned so let's just keep up with it i think it's insane
but it's also absolutely worth reading because it comes from someone who really knows what they're
talking about it is important to challenge the opinions that we find poor anymore great i was
just gonna say it's it's it's good to explore people who you disagree with but that doesn't
mean you need to find out which one of them what race they are or what gender they are just for
example my standard right now whenever i give something an extended review is um look at 40
reviews that are randomly selected from youtube i don't care what race or gender they could all be
in favor of the film as well i'm doing it randomly i just don't care so and i come across a plenty of
people who rip into it and i'm like huh that's interesting huh that's not interesting huh you
know why do you have to make it about just it's a better metric i suppose it's a better metric
to choose people who disliked it unliked it versus we're black we're white he's up great
lives okay let's talk about rotten tomatoes we have to now i want to clear up one thing
that might seem obvious to most people but i promise you there are people who aren't aware
of this rotten tomatoes is not a group of people who give movies graves it does not review movies
it has no opinions of its own are you gonna explain why we don't need to take rotten tomatoes
seriously is i got this this is gonna be this i already he could go anyway he can go anywhere
with this i mean at the same time remember he said earlier that there's every review no reviewer or
critic takes money for reviews they're not bribed they're not encouraged you know they're they're
totally 100 earnest every single one of them rotten tomatoes is an algorithm is a review
aggregator it adds up every review published for a given movie and then tells you what percentage
of those reviews are positive and the score does not yeah that's why it's a terrible gauge
that's good to say i don't take rotten tomatoes seriously i think it's just retarded i find it
hilarious when something like the last jedi sinks below was it attack the clones it went below
any other star wars film that amuses me but it doesn't actually it doesn't that's not evidence
that the film is bad strictly speaking it's just evidence of the public opinion well that's you
can't even really say that definitively it's just yeah it's just a fun little statistic whatever if
people are saying the rotten tomato score is bad therefore the film is bad yeah that you don't need
to tell us that that's not accurate but you can do anyway quality it's really a reflection of how
broad a movie's appears yeah so thor ragnarok has a 92 percent so does the shape of water does that
mean that critics thought those movies were equally good possibly probably not possibly
you can't know you can't know either i haven't seen the shape of water so i don't know the
the point is that it's just like we know we know all of this move on it just means that the same
number of critics enjoyed them this is precisely why numbers are stupid by the way and this is why
yms didn't want to do numbers and still has to justify his numbers all the time because he'll
give an assessment of a film and then you'll give it like a seven then another assessment of a film
give it like seven and people are like but you hated that film way more and you love that film
way more and you're giving both at seven he's just like uh yes because yeah also tied to how
you feel at the time because numbers it's really fucking hard to be consistent on giving a film a
number they boost it to 100 numbers a thousand numbers to try and allow it some space which
just it never works out definitively as objective assessments never will but numbers are so based in
objectivity and logic and math that people assume that that's exactly what they do mean
both here's my usual routine for digesting film criticism before seeing a movie i'll skim
reactions from critics i trust on twitter are glanced briefly at the reviews and if enough of
them seem to dig it i'll see the movie then after he said it again he's just admitted to only seeing
movies based on reviews and then he said earlier movie reviewers aren't paid because why would they
be so we like that part and just put it next to each other he doesn't listen to his own fucking
words it's insane i'll skim reactions from critics i trust on twitter are glanced briefly
at the reviews and if enough of them seem to dig it i'll see the movie then afterwards i'll go to
rotten tomatoes and pull up all the reviews from critics i like and read all their takes on it
jesus christ how's your confirmation bias dude like damn you just told us to check out reviews
from people who disagree with us and you're like i will only pull them up from people i like
it's like good stuff man is that based on their race or what they say i don't know because i want
to see a bunch of different perspectives for example with a movie like black panther a review
by a 25 year old white guy on youtube is probably not again rice sake that is actually a direct
reference to me and wolf we can't judge black panther we're not allowed fuck you this guy's
this guy's fucking racist this guy's like straight up racist he actually is a fucking racist
but that's man i can finally call someone a racist and take it seriously me and wolf are
not allowed to review black panther because we're white this this guy pretty much just said that
let's let's get the whole thing let's get the whole thing in the context so i like and read
all their takes on it because i want to see a bunch of different perspectives for example
panther yeah as long as they're the right race
so a review by a 25 year old white guy on youtube is probably not going to have much to offer
but that's i'm sorry 25 i have to i just want to complain what do you mean they don't have much to
offer what does that even fuck you like i can't think of anything else to say imagine if you said
a black guy reviewing once upon a time in the west probably doesn't have anything to offer
i'm making an official of this video there will be a quote in my video for the for the
april fool's day that says a review by a white person will offer nothing if reviewing big
mama's house i mean how can he just try to figure out how he can justify saying anything like that
like how can you gauge how much value a white person has when they when they do or say anything
be it uh writing a book making a movie making a review a youtube video you're a white guy how do
i know that well i know for a fact that nothing you say has any worth at all but that's because
you're a fucking idiot not because you're white yeah we will justify that how about that um what's
his name patrick or something he's like we won't hold the your whiteness against you we're not like
that yeah you can stream with us yms we know we're not even racing
apparently you should be a lot of people are seeking out there's infinitely more you see you're
you're going out trying to seek out people's perspective based on their race and that's a
good thing to do fucking shit to be gained by reviews from people of color who can offer an
educated discussion about the cultural and historical aspects of the movie you know what
i'm sure you'd approve of me and wolce reviews of black panther if they were positive
this is about the culture yo yeah because that's because you're an ally because then you would be
you'd be woke jesus fucking christ here i'm gonna post this like a big mama's house in unbridled
i'm just gonna put that i'm just gonna fucking put that quote over his face just be like yeah
a 20 of the review a black panther review by a 25 year old white guy probably doesn't have anything
to offer big mama is woke as fuck jesus fuck i mean it's like what's funny he was big mama's
house or the nutty professor the uh big mama's house but it's insane like what if you were just
like oh okay well let's be consistent movies that are mostly white that take place in any
predominantly white culture black reviewers we shouldn't listen to them because they probably
don't have anything to offer i think that's the part that really gets you're gonna be a racist
be consistent if he said uh white people will only be able to offer their perspective on on
a film that covers black issues or something i could just be like oh yeah that old line but
he actually said white people aren't gonna have much to offer it's like what the hell
what if i'm a 25 year old white male but i have a master's degree in black science
or black it's like black magic but it's even worse what's this guy's name uh patrick is it
patrick's i've got it in my title uh patrick why that's just in the chat williams i'm just lurking
oh why am i coming out with this yeah i i gotta see if patrick williams has a black panther review
because i searched black panther patrick williams he's got he's well he didn't he say he doesn't
critique movies he only um yeah he's not a movie critic he only does video essays i believe
but that's not movie criticism oh i i i can't see it yet um
i don't see it maybe it's out there i'm curious i mean we've only got what two minutes left of his
video now so if you want to we want to just uh finish it off yeah we can but i don't i i can't
maybe he does but i can't quite find it so at least he's he's woke enough to know that he doesn't have
anything to offer oh that's yeah i mean i'm assuming you're going to point out the hypocrisy
that if he had made a black panther analysis without being able to offer anything well if he
ever brings that black panther in any kind of criticism he's a hypocrite because it doesn't
have to be a video devoted to it i mean the problem is guys which every assessment we've
had of him has been about logical inconsistencies and he's already said that logic is the enemy
so do any of our criticism actually hold water if he doesn't subscribe to the idea of logic
just right made a video called black panther fixes marvel's most common flaws
yeah that was actually a suggestion for us to cover eventually but uh that's some shit
it's pretty bad one day it was it was the first video that i saw from him there i was like
what are you doing just right what are you doing then he went on to make his first last jedi video
and i was like oof stop it then he made another one and i'm like no and then you were able to
talk to him and that went really well no it didn't like this guy is he's he's the worst
we've i think he's the worst you guys think this is the worst person we've ever talked about
because i i actually think he's a contender well he's first off he's racist he's openly racist
which doesn't help um he's very elitist he wants to he's definitely an advocate for gatekeeping
oh yeah he is he's ready to tell us objectively that there's a right and wrong way to watch movies
he does the things that he criticizes other people of doing he openly blatantly contradicts himself
on almost every issue he uh uh argument from authority fallacy um source fallacies he clear
disdain for you know the layman a layman critic or a youtube critic um he's ready to
he's huge straw man a huge straw man advocate i guess this guy's got this guy's fucking awful
he i think this guy's the worst and then there's like all of that plus he constantly talks over
himself as in like says a thing and then later just says the complete opposite thing and you're
like oh yeah totally contradicts himself you can dance the politics and what the movie is actually
saying yeah yeah yeah black people what's the movie actually saying black people please tell
us white people what is this actually bullshit what is this why why do you have to keep using
buzzwords why can't you use real words oh god i just used a buzzword yes please black people
please tell us white people what it's about what it's interesting looking at reviews
that just repeated my own thoughts back at me i wanted to learn more and deepen my understanding
no you didn't you just said you only look at people you like
you're a liar you don't listen to your own statements he is that yeah pretending of the
film and i wasn't going to get that from critics whose perspectives were identical to my own but
i think that's reflective of a lot of film culture on youtube a lot of people just want
to hear someone articulate exactly that's not film culture on youtube that is people people like to
reaffirm what they think is right they like their opinions satisfying stuff that's a problem in every
industry people like listen to the same genres of music because they've confirmed that they like
that the ones they're listening to it like stems from actual taste to genuinely not wanting to like
what i like when i buy a product i'll watch a review of it after i've bought it because it's
a good review of that product because it confirms that i made a good decision and i was right
thank you it's just i can't follow any sense of this guy's actual
process for thinking about anything this most confusing like
maze of what's going on in there i can't imagine how he would react to criticism
like if someone said watch mauler's review i would imagine him watching
parts of it and just going like he's white he's like all right then see you later i guess
sorry my bad right in me too and that can be satisfying and yeah an obvious point we missed
like uh i wonder if the people watching his videos are just agreeing with him and he's just
repeating back to them and satisfying their perspective like nah it doesn't apply to it
all the criticisms he's actually brought up can all apply to him especially the first video we
watched but it's just like nah no self-awareness no uh no explanation of a scale or a set of rules
that make his perspective unable to be applied to himself aside from what was it traditional
he's a traditional critic or he only likes traditional critics not what we know what
traditional i enjoy it sometimes too but film criticism is about more than that it's about
having our perceptions of art challenged and expanded it's so that's why you only watch people
you like this just keep coming back to that you can't get out of it it's like we should always
get it challenged but i'll only check out people i i think are good discussion as long as it's the
right race telling me what to think oh jeez echo chamber so if you don't already i highly recommend
following critics who write what does that traditional mean fucking hell what is a traditional
movie review surely he has he mentioned that no he's just he keeps i don't think he's given
any kind of traditional does he mean by white people oh god i think my only guess is what is
the difference between a review written by someone like rogerie but in 1970 versus a review on youtube
today you're like uh i guess he would have focused on i don't know i don't know what the
difference is because he said the bob chipman does traditional reviews i mean traditionally retarded
i don't know such a buzzword he keeps saying it it's like what this video relies on and it's just
like please define it just a sentence give me something additional movie reviews critics who
know more than you oh no oh you bob chipman knows more than i do okay that's pretty impressive so
white okay you're being heady little faggot dude we i'm sure you know we would have a discussion
with him and the moment that he runs out of options he would say i know better than you
okay i have i wonder if this guy has a he talks like somebody who is he's trying to constantly
validate his degree yeah i'm sorry that the world doesn't work this way that it's not based
on what education you had it's based on what you say and how valid and how what value your actual
opinion and perspective and what it's built on has it has nothing to do with just going
i'm from here and i went here i did this even say something that fucking people call me pretentious
i mean holy fuck is he playing a character is this a parody see that's the thing if that it
would be no i would love it if it was a parody affluent social justice warriors soy boy elitist
i'm better than you i could support black people i could totally see this being a good parody like
it's not far away from what i do on april fools it really isn't
i mean honestly jerry genesis comes off as more sincere than this guy absolutely not every critic
is good plenty or bad like rex like you that would just be one you are not a good critic
so if you're staring at the hundreds of cracker on tomatoes no clue i'll go back to rex reed
yeah i didn't recognize the name i mean i don't know the name but just the fact that he's saying
that anyone other than himself sucks is just really incredibly amusing it's pretty unfair to
just raise bob chipman and throw some random other guy under the bus just two names you know
shit on one raise one okay he's an old movie critic and author um like what like is he white
he is he is a white male did he review black panther there we go oh dude i just realized
yms reviewed black panther and he's white he fucked up he fucked up sorry yms but i don't
think you have anything to offer sorry madam i i'm sorry to tell you this but you're a nazi
can you please take down the video until you i don't know become black or whatever is required
i'm not clear on the rules criticism is about more than that it's about having our perceptions
of art appa ben brought up a good point share it's more sincere than anybody literally anybody he
there is no filter between his brain and his mouth
it's a discussion neither logic is he white buildo bag
when it comes to parent there's no filter there's if there's no logic no reason no social norm
or polite convention will prevent what he's thinking from coming out
so if you don't already i highly recommend following critics who write traditional movie
reviews what is another word more than you about film make sure you follow all the blackies and all
the women it's so smug it's like all the people who know more than you what do you how do we
establish that they know more than me don't listen to their arguments you need to look at
the race and gender that's when you know yes i gotta make sure they have something to offer me
someone put traditional in the three parentheses tradition i i got this i see what you did there
grounds and offer different perspectives and obviously so he said superior and then he said
different perspectives like pick one mate and the thing is this traditional thing is bugging me
because it's almost it's always a really good idea to define your terms at the beginning of a video
you know so that people know what the fuck you're talking about why bother
everyone already agrees with him on his channel i guess not every critic is good plenty or bad
like rex reid that guy sucks so if you're maybe that's like an in joke or something well
way delivers that the 1969 academy awards oh i don't know then i don't i don't know what that
was i don't know anything about rex reid if he's white then we already know what it sounds like
he sounds like a comic book hero he's probably gonna watch this video and be like they don't
even know who rex reid is yms says he likes bob chipman because he's in bed with journalists at
polyganic otaku no no no no no no no no yms you don't understand yms that's that's pretty
at the beginning of this video he said critics are not paid off they are not zero that's a myth
it does not happen exactly how can you be so dumb adam no no reviewers ever paid off we uh he said
we need to just make a note we we'll we'll show him because it's right at the beginning
we're on 9 30 a i'll just remember that so let's just kidding out if you're not dumb
a little bit come on where where's where's the numbers i want to clear up some misconceptions
that i know some unique opinions and critics do not hate everything no this was point one
on that hey off critics to track right up front i want to clear up some misconceptions that i know
some people have critics are not bought or bribed disney does not critics to trash dc movies it's not
so yeah why miss not only you white but you're wrong about that too this guy just said that
never happens critics are not bought and they are not bribed is not exactly i literally have offers
all the time from from people who email me to say we want to pay you to promote this product
and some of them will even ask and name your rates because they know to ask people for their rates
because that's how prevalent this shit is what is your rate for killing dude it doesn't happen
you guys are just tin foil hat wearing idiots it doesn't happen i know you have evidence but
that's based on logic and who needs it be honest i'm glad you agree honestly not every critic is
good plenty or bad like rex reid that guy sucks sorry rex reid for playing this clip three times
i don't i don't know anything about rex reid i nobody i don't think anybody knows who rex
reid is who just casually is watching this video i've never heard of him and when i looked him up
like shit from like the 60s was popping kylar brings up a good point you can't really criticize
prometheus unless you're uh you've been you've had a tentacle rape baby like that's how can you
really associate with the character how would i ever know how to put myself in the shoes of someone
who gives birth to a fucking space squid but i mean we joke about it but really like let's be
honest here if you're not a woman then how can you put yourself into ripley shoes exactly i can't
even associate i was like is she afraid she looks afraid but i don't know i'm not a woman that's why
i only get along with bishop because he's a man he's a robot you can't get along with a robot he's
a manly man who bleeds cum said to throw that in there didn't you had to make it weird you know
he's not a straight white male so if you're staring at the hundreds of critics on ron tomatoes
with no clue how to tell who's worth reading let me offer some let me tell you who's the correct
critics no self-awareness dude no self-awareness these are some of my favorite critics working
right oh god here we go and whether you agree with them or not i think they're worth reading
so matt dollar sites matt singer amy nicholson genya motto david sims drew mcqueenie david arlick
oh jesus also yeah i don't know any of those names genuinely don't know any of those names
i've never i have no idea i'm assuming they're all traditional non youtuber or something yeah
this is that what it means does traditional mean not youtuber is that maybe that's that could
actually be it like he said accept bob chipman accept bob chipman not youtuber bob chipman he's
the guy who calls out you know all the racists so he's trusted but that that skull on wheels
and that skate hurry don't listen to those guys they don't know what they're talking about
when the streams ends rags will open to the side of the skull get inside drive the skull
drive to the factory maurice sidded laka scott tobias do you really know all these names off by
fucking hell the folks on the slash film cast oh maybe he's probably reading a script actually
dargis bill gabiri jordan hoffman alison will moor glenn kenny tasha robinson mike ryan
priscilla page brit hayes emily oshida richard lassen angie hahn and go back and read old
literally don't know any of those names i guess never heard of them i'm not saying they're good
or bad i'm just saying i've never heard of these could this be because we're white maybe because
you're not traditional fucking reviewers dude i'm sorry for accepting new and changing technology
he's reading his iphone contacts i mean if if he really does mean like not youtubers in this
sense it's like which he might i mean if that's the case how can he possibly say you're on youtube
you blithering idiot i know it's why should we take you serious how can you possibly say
anything that i mean i'm i'm just amazed i'm amazed that jared genesis comes off as intelligent
compared to you he is less contradictory yeah i mean this is more consistent i mean at least
jared's like consistently fucking stupid because i mean he thinks fucking ray killed hahn solo
but but he never says someone else killed hahn solo in a second later he sticks to
yeah if he's wrong he sticks with that shit yeah so someone's clearly highlighted stop watching
youtube from a youtuber make sure you read i mean look i like reading but god damn it he is so
pretentious when he's like oh yeah i'm just going to uh tell you guys to read these ones it's like
oh my god i'll do book reviews but i'm not going to tell people just go fuck you need to start
listening to traditional reviewers okay traditional reviewers know about yeah yeah sure let me hop on
my time machine and i'll go listen stop talking about plot holes by the way i don't know if yms
is still there or not but like the references to a quiet place it's like how could he how could his
fan base not fucking link the shit out of him for for this video because uh it's like every person
who ever criticized film with a plot hole gets to watch this video basically be infuriated
oh thanks i mean i'm like genuinely like livid that this man is just so utterly fucking retarded
like i i there's not been one single intelligent thought to come out of this entire video and it's
like well he knew what the videos were recorded with yeah well that's true in fact they wouldn't
be possible if it wasn't for sinhouser roger ebert he just said the robert ebert reviews are really
good but robert ebert robert is totally a white guy though did roger ebert review black panther
but george de bediba was dead by then i'm afraid so no he did not but his website guy who's
it's the kind of guy who'll be like yeah i read talking
this is the kind of guy who would would say a bunch of things that would criticize roger
ebert by accident and then go back and be like no he's good though he's okay he's traditional
now he comes from a place where he thinks that just because people talk about plot holes more
than they used to that it must be fabricated and illegitimate you see he's from a time where
youtube was not quite invented and so he was he didn't even know what plot holes are well we
were all born before plot holes so we're older than plot holes and a friend of mine's been sending
me quotes 2012 was when plot holes happened a friend of mine's been sending me quotes from roger
ebert complaining about plot holes by the way oh shit oh fuck shut it down let me just you're
fucking idiot let me just read a few of them for you roger ebert on i am legend it's distracting
to see flaws in the interior logic of the world um a movie creates uh roger ebert on high tension
with a plot hole large enough to drive a truck through uh roger ebert on along came a spider a
few loopholes i can forgive but when a plot is riddled with them crippled by them made implausible
by them i get distracted sorry dude you're gonna have to reference someone other than roger ebert
he may be traditional but he's not on your team never would be oh my god it it you'd almost it
almost does seem like this should be a parody because i just can't fathom at the end he says
surprise gotcha surprise i was just pretending to be retarded people are gonna argue that we'd be
like uh this guy is illogical he's pleading insane that's how these videos make sense you'd be like
oh we're judging the narrative that's gonna be excused because he was insane when he made them
has this guy said anything that he hasn't contradicted it's like no no he's not yet
well he he started off by saying hello he's probably gonna say goodbye
he just says hello again complete total contradiction someone in the chat said robert is
what robert is our guy recording but what i'm trying to say is that if you like movies you
should stop recording and don't start again if you like movies you should the only way you end
that sentence correctly is say you should watch movies if you like them there's no other thing
you should do if you like movies yeah it should implies that i mean is there a goal that we're
working towards me apparently criticisms apparently you should go and pursue great
real traditional critics if you like film not those idiots on youtube yeah you know those
people you like like that that mueller that desanid walf for the freaking rugs they're
all just idiots they also don't know what they're talking about that your movie sucks guy all he
does is nitpick he just he's right the plot any oh god yeah i forgot about that right he's a male
as far as i know he might actually be human as well that's another tick against you
film criticism honestly it will make you like movies even more oh fuck you so that's all oh
yeah you know what he's in a hotel i guess um okay okay we're so close to the
end that you want to pause it what the fuck we've nearly survived the journey and you want to pause
it how did cinema sins is terrible it's absolute garbage and i love the idea this guy's telling us
it was a bad youtube wait wait wait let me hey guys i just want to tell you well hold on i
gotta make my audio quality shit like he does because this is what a good youtuber does
what wait what's this guy's uh name again after i think okay everyone just want you to know um
you know you know the video you're planning for your hundred thousand what you need to do when
it's ended cut to black and then it cuts to you at your bedside with your fucking camera you go
just wanted to say patrick williams is terrible fucking groveling like i'm fucking smeagol from
the two sours to record myself as i i get down on my knees the side of the desk and hold the webcam
downwards to face me while i'm down here while my fucking milk is out here on the countertop you
know the implication that he woke up and was like i need to say that cinema sins is a bad shot
i have to do it to call other people a bad channel you fucking piece of shit
i don't even like cinema sins and i'm in i want to go subscribe to him just to spite you
oh i want to i want to hear this it will make you like movies even more so that's all oh and one
last thing uh cinema sins is terrible it's absolute garbage and it actively hurts film criticism
so my recommendation is to not watch it that is actually something that um i hate everything and
alluded to in his last jedi video but he said that he was among the people who have
caused this idea that film criticism has taken a downturn because of encouraging nitpicking stuff
i think that's a very um defeatist perspective of it all thanks it's just like i give up everybody's
just doing this stuff now thanks to all these guys like argue for why your film is good i don't even
disagree that cinema sins is kind of shit but you don't get to call other people shit when you make
just terrible awful goddamn videos like this he thinks it's good though it's completely random
at the end he he got finished editing this video and was like oh i gotta take a crack at cinema
sins what a spiteful little bitch i was gonna say it's really really we got the bitter element in
the last video but that ending it's like wow man you couldn't you couldn't just not have the ending
where you shit on another channel explain why he's just like oh shit don't watch this is the
interesting thing i actually if approaching any film i'm gonna check out cinema sins
just in case he actually raises a point where i'm like oh
because it's actually possible not everything cinema sin says and does is invalid they actually
i hope to god that's soy milk no it's it's no it's skim you could tell by the light blue
you don't know that rax you might have refilled it because i'm not a fucking faggot so
yeah i wouldn't personally some some skim milk is has a pink top but i wouldn't personally recommend
cinema sins uh to learn about film criticism but i i have more respect and more respect for
your intelligence to go and watch him if you enjoy him because you can tell the difference when he
makes good criticisms or ones that are just kind of for example he makes joke criticisms every once
in a while like there's not a lap dance in this scene if you're going to take that seriously and
be like wow he judges films because they don't have lap dances he's not a real critic i just
be like good lord calm down he'll be fine yeah he he's an entertainment channel first
what i've discovered is this guy is racist sexist heterophobic i can't even believe i
unironically had to use that term he is spiteful he's contradictory he's hypocritical he really
needs to shave that fucking awful goddamn haircut because wow just go bald man just go bald and he's
got fucking skim milk behind him here i mean i how did people subscribe to this guy i don't get it
i don't get it either i'd love to uh i'd love to ask people what they see in him
oh that was it so if you like the videos we're making and you want to help us make more of them
it takes more than one person to make this garbage you had to drag some other human being into this
solving the mystery of jj it's not that difficult it doesn't go that deep don't you know what else is
apparently really difficult um not understanding that your youtube thumbnail has the timestamp
on the bottom right so you should never put text to the bottom right of your thumbnail hey man
maybe someone on his team made that not him you're being very rude being very white right now
i can't help my being white i could go get some more sun and become browner slash redder
yeah that's super male vitality and it'll get you a little redder yeah we actually did it we
got through both of his videos it only took us five hours but we did it and we might have found
who we consider to essentially be the worst film oh shit why mess why mess tweeted out five minutes
ago roger ebert on high tension 2003 the rest of the movie you will have to see for yourself
or not which would be my recommendation i am tempted at this point to issue a spoiler warning
and engage in discussion of several crucial events in the movie that would seem to be physically
logically and dramatically impossible but clever viewers will be able to see for themselves that
the movie's plot has a hole that is not only large enough to drive a truck through but in fact does
have a truck driven right through it and yms says oops apparently roger ebert wasn't watching
movies correctly and he's not a real critic see that'll work with our audience but i feel like
you might get melted on twitter for saying that here's the thing like yms is he's just fucking
woke on this guy well oh my god because he's made like three tweets about it and a long ass comment
this is ridiculous yms gives a shit people are sending this guy's videos to people like yms
people like me people like wolf because it's like you see you guys are stupid for good after
plot it's like he didn't make any arguments he contradicts himself what are you what did you
think this was gonna do make us for a second go oh yes it turns out that when you notice things
that don't make any sense you should just ignore them i see now dude i'm gonna i'm actually gonna
do the whole crouching next to my dad and be like this guy fucking sucks patrick willams don't
don't subscribe to patrick willams don't subscribe to patrick willams he's a racist i have the clips
to prove it clips to prove it uh um i should probably catch up with my super chats i've let
them flow uh hateful slap him of course got it skipped so hard to keep track i can't remember
the last one we we measured i shall just work from the bottom up that'll make sense yeah uh
this donation wouldn't be possible without sanheiser so thanks sanheiser
uh rex reid film critic who had his own show at the movies and wrote on the town with rex reid
i mean again we don't know him but this guy's throwing shit on him without justifying it so
let him let him do his thing i guess don't subscribe to patrick willams Bilbo Baggins
the Bilbo memes are never gonna not buddy this man clearly needs to take a hint from Jared and
eat some yo-yos just make sure you get your q tips on your desk because that really adds to
flavor uh this guy just took the biggest douche in the universe award from john edwards who's john
edward uh crossing over with john edward still don't know that is the show about where he talks
to ghosts oh was he a douche i don't know i don't know well he pretends to talk to dead people and
scam people oh yeah that would that would be pretty usually that's definitely a douche bag
yeah because that's not a thing that happens ever and if you believe it then you're getting scammed
your traditionalist view will be your undoing your faith that your logic is yours
uh just got here and i'm a selfish pond buffalo so is there any chance i can get a lightning fast
recap this guy made a video explaining why we shouldn't give a shit about plot holes
it's the most confusing 10 minutes of nonsense we've ever seen so we responded to it live we went
through every part of it and then this video was recommended where he talks about film criticism
and again it's just as nonsensical i don't think this guy had a coherent thought in his head
ever and i don't think he ever checks his own work i don't think he ever really
considers the ramifications of every single statement he makes objectively
it's the most confusing set of nonsense ever and yeah i actually take the crown for worst youtuber
ever and this is coming from someone who was seen a lot on youtube you know like would you
say he's the worst my time would you say he's the worst in terms of like a genre or the worst just
full stop full stop i mean honestly i'd rather watch someone as disingenuous as downward thrust
over this guy i think this guy's the worst i think i think he's the worst because i mean honestly
downward thrust is like you can laugh at him well but this guy is just like he makes me angry
wouldn't the worst people be the ones that like actually manipulate people out of getting money
like like for example um the the csgo scamming shit you know like people who encourage trying
to get kids to trade off money and stuff like that would probably be the worst people who are
trying to get money out of kids i don't know this guy seems like the kind of guy who would do that
if he chance uh if we don't involve any kind of actual real damage to people like it's literally
just sharing your perspective then yeah i'd say he's one of the worst easily but no one's ever
going to be better than jerry genesis so no there's no point even trying at that point
why would you even try to go through someone said um historical significance of black panther what
like yes there is a lot of people that feel you have to judge black panther within uh sort of sort
of like a perspective of what it means for a culture what it means about sharing ideas about
a past that as it could and and you know like my focus will always be on a script for every single
movie but they're like you have to talk about that and you can't talk about it unless you are black
because you need to have experienced it sharing sounds like white people propaganda from my point
of view the white dudes are evil this is fair i graduated from Oberlin college with a degree in
cinema studies his website so there you go oh oh does that say does it say that on his website
i guess anybody can get a fucking degree these days can you imagine he'd be like i graduated
from Oberlin college with a degree in cinema studies and we're like huh what does that even
mean there's people that get degrees in gender studies so that's true there you go and there
it is i thought bola was a black skull on wheels that's why i agree unconditionally with him you
how can you not you know he's talking about getting different perspectives so different uh
shades of of race different genders i'm a literal skull on wheels like can you get that from anywhere
else literally anywhere else yeah i mean come on i'm a wolf rags as a dog for tea as a yellow donut
um uh yeah movie bobs spider movie bobs spider-man one and two reviews are solid i've not seen them
and i'm sure as goes even for feminist frequency they can make something good just what is it
that broken clocks right twice a day that's they can do it i hope mola versus just right equals
thanos one hit KOing the hulk that's like subjective man the hulk screen we should probably
get him to review films we probably get a lot of um that's an insult to the whole yeah he's white
on the inside way too cool for that depending on the day he's greed on the inside you know you
never know uh watching films is how you understand what makes a good film or not well that's the
thing uh a lot of people can get educated on uh i think i've made this analogy to one of you guys
before but you know like you could read every book about carpentry but you actually need to
start doing carpentry to get better at it you need to you know get a feel for it all is a very
physical thing and and so translates you just keep reading about i don't know um how films
are constructed and you never actually watch a film or read a story you're gonna be in trouble
didn't they with all this like it's like the difference between street smart and book smart i
guess need some experience you know need to get in there you need uh you need to you need to have
that applied i prefer jared's room to this guy this guy's room's boring i mean at least jared's
room has like lowered like the skeleton with all the marks on the arms jared's the the light uh
the light switch without any panel over it it wasn't even his gear at tea spring store spat
slash patrick williams i'll look that up cracks open monster yep they don't make critics likely
used to sips monster uh yep newspapers sure are the best place for critics and remember guys if
if you bought the shirt what does it feel like wearing the shirt of a racist think the same as
me video too no seriously many slaps are necessaries hitting my brain me no like
only sith deal in logic yes this is true someone said trust me this gets bonkers by the end it's
like it was bonkers throughout i'm not sure do you think what was the highlight of the worst thing
in this video do you reckon uh the racism i think it would probably be that that's worse than anything
because it's like legitimate racism but you never really get to highlight it because everyone's
just like racism that sort of thing it's only white people who could do that oh he's white though
maybe that this chance i have to get my book of how racism works because uh it's completely
different now the definitions i love your mids vids mauler but i rags i want to have your babies
well oh god his well his shirts are bad dms are open why's he got mitch
yeah one shirt says ask me about my opinions on color grading and then there's h in parentheses
i don't know what the fuck that means alantis here we come there's some yellow person
uh hard to heart in that no i mean he's like literally yellow um i wish yms along with ralph
would get into a debate with some of these idiots they'd ruin them i would love yms and this guy to
have a debate would be hilarious next time we watch another we gotta have yeah man um let um
yeah like let us know we'd love to have you in here here oh he didn't say that a donation did
i haven't got anything for why that's no i know i'm saying i would love to have yms and that'd be
great as would i but um very busy man we should probably call him adam as well instead of
ms bit awkward i suppose i don't know i'm sure he's okay with it uh yimmes yimmes reminded that
roger ebert came around and loved zoolander best film ever made clear depends what he plot holes
crickets cricket critical cracks corked correctly patrick ain't one of them
um and there we go i am caught up oh there's new ones uh rambling incoherently comes off
as intelligent to stupid people well this is the thing we say it about downward thrust we say it
about a lot of videos if you really listen to what they're saying you will find there are things
that you can't possibly reconcile and so you should be confused but a lot of people just like
no i i like putting it on the background you know and that's fine how do you how do you talk
and not say anything yes that is that is this is what these are tutorials for um you see matthymatosis
review of god of all thoughts on if you did i've only seen the first 10 minutes i'm liking it so far

pretty good thankful oh yeah um matthymatosis if you want to make you don't strain with it

food right now sir that's some multitasking shit right at the same time damn well i don't burn your
video uh oh someone sent us all a picture of rex reid and he's uh he looks like a very very
straight white male no deal oh he's super straight i don't know anything about him though but like i
was getting shit popping up from like 1969 and i was like oh this is i like is an older guy i've
never heard of him i guess he's an older movie critic should have been writing he's got better
hair than patrick should have been writing and editing this entire time thanks for the distraction
you sons of bitches laugh my ass off a few times thank you he's actually passionate news he's uh
he's a friend of mine who's also a youtube channel that i can't recommend yet because all he does is
buffy stuff so it'll be spoilers don't worry he'll well he's actually got a few movie reviews
you could check out um but the second i make some kind of collab with him i'll make all of
you watch his channel it'll be great um and then h in parentheses there we go brought to every
donation thank you all very much very kind i don't know what you guys want to do at this point um

bit of a if i got to get to so beautiful so yes thank you all for joining me it's been a wonderful
five hours and ten minutes i'm gonna let this stay up i mean the worst hours i know the worst thing
that will happen is my channel will be frustrated that it's not a review but they're coming okay
so if you get to the end of this video it's coming i've literally i'm getting like a week
away from finishing the full script which is going to be an estimated i'm going to say an
estimated 13 to 15 hours that is the expectation but uh so maybe open up this video with something
saying like while i'm working on well i was just gonna make it public but but i guess oh yeah maybe
like in the description or something oh i could i'll just pin a comment that'll work um yeah but
yeah so it'll it'll take a while to edit but you're gonna be getting a shit ton of content once i
finish it all i suppose but um yeah so thank you all for for watching hope you had some fun and
thank you guests for for being here you fucking five hours goodbye bye bye toodles farewell
