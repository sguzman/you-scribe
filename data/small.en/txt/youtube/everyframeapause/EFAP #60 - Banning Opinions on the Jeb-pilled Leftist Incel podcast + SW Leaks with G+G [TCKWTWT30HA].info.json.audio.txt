I haven't done any kind of sound checks. I'm just gonna do that in the opening 10 minutes as you guys speak
I will change levels meticulously and you won't even know
Wow
Or anything
Notification for what for life? I don't know how things work without notifications smaller
Um, you just gotta just let it flow be yourself. Let it go. Let it go
Just let it go let it go
Let go of the list smaller. Oh, no knows every lyric to let it go. Let it go stop holding on to it
Please that's definitely the lyrics right there. Isn't frozen suit or is that already? I don't remember the trailers
I've been seeing pop up in places
It's coming out soon. It's it's gonna make a ridiculous amount of fucking money and I have no interest in
Hearing or listening to anything, but I will say the frozen to store section or the aisles in the store are way bigger than Star Wars
No Star Wars toys, but Star Wars is doing great everybody that's a lie Ethan Van Skyver is a very good
Customer to the to the the products of Star Wars like roast eco dolls off the shelves
He is single-handedly responsible for all of the rose deco action figure cells
Imagine that was that actual reality? We found out it was like 70% of the dolls were bought by him. She's like, oh my
Honestly who buys a rose deco doll outside of collectors
Okay, maybe I'm assuming too much
Yeah, I remember she was complaining about
The something with rose deco action figures and all of a sudden
She was pretty much just trying to praise rose deco and the the merchandise and then itchy Baca commented below
He said hey, Ginny mind posting a picture of your rose deco action figure
crickets
Never bought it. Did she ever bought one way? She was like praising rose deco stuff and she didn't have any yourself. Okay
Over rose deco
Well folks are better than rose deco and from what I've heard that's just a meme
There was some comments on the view saying you guys didn't realize her buying all that merchandise was just a meme
I was like, okay
Apparently it's a joke apart of a child. She buys which dice it displays it because that's
That's ironic. I don't know. I I I don't watch enough of a content to know but apparently there's like there's extended jokes on your
channel about buying merch, so
Okay, hello all my jeb words
I'm, so sorry. There's some high rags in the channel. It's like he's not here yet any moment
I'm certain of it
um
But yes as well as the people flow in welcome to efap number 60 and people are like wait a minute
Wasn't there a different 60?
There was a different 60. It was claimed by the evil monsters at the bbc and uh until I get it free
Which has taken it's probably gonna take the entire month of claim time
That efap is locked away, which is sad because it's five hours of memes
It's just us looking at meme videos and pictures. I had like this
I had like a thousand fucking meme pictures to go through I've got a whole bunch today as well
Ranking our efap villains and that was those fun times. Oh, yeah, we ranked we ranked the efap villains
So anybody who's not here seen that you've got some fun on the way now
What's gonna happen is they'll free it i'll download it re-upload it to moolah and then it'll fight for another month
against claims so it can literally just be in its original form if they
Decide to take it further, which I don't think bbc typically do I don't know do they do that jay?
Do you know more about this than I do?
I've never fought the bbc
I've just I can't be bothered to I just removed the clips and then re-uploaded one night when they when they came after me
Fair enough. Uh, which means like i'm hoping have you marked this episode kit friendly or is this
I marked all of moolah and moolah as a non-kid friendly because to be fair. It's not
Should my kid watch this i'd be like no
And you know, it's whatever uh
Parental guidance that if they want their kids to see some of my videos on my main channel go for it. But um
Yeah, this this whole thing with youtube looks dodgy
Like if you have a video you said is okay for kids and then they spot one word
But they don't like
That they're going as far as being like you understand lawsuits can happen. You're like, okay. All right, just chill out like
Good times
so
Oh, sorry, go ahead. That's good
Well and the fact that you can't it's not gonna run targeted ads or anything. There's no comments
I just think that it's pretty easy that I mean i'm i'm gonna mark my channel as not for kids and just
Not worry about it ever again
Yeah, I just you know, i'm mostly on if it like took all the way by revenue i'd be like, holy shit
I didn't realize the cold was going for children
But I think we'll be fine, um
It's a weird thing though
It's as weird as that emote thing that was going on too, which has stopped now, right from from what everyone knows youtube fixed it
You should have
So like well, I was banned. I was banned for six months for using emojis. Um, i'm glad
Ah, yes, you just hate speech like people should be able to spam the dons in chat, you know, if they want to
Yeah, full haircut emoji, but uh, be careful folks. Maybe use one or two dons. Don't use
17 dons just because there was this weird thing that happened where youtube were like
Deleting google accounts if they spammed emotes
because that's normal and reasonable and um
Um, don't assume my emojis don't assume my emojis either, please
As far as I know didn't they get that fixed? I think markiplier. Yeah markiplier complained about it. Youtube looked into it
I think it's fixed for now. So you should be able to use your dons. All right, it should be fine
Next though, so just never do anything ever to be i was gonna say careful posting words because words, you know
Yes, yes your account becomes inactive they may delete it so just
Just don't have an account
Words are indeed violent. I haven't told so
The phenomenal idea just don't have an account. Oh, yeah, don't just don't
Just don't anything just don't like they're coming for jed next be careful the single commandment handed down from god. Don't
like okay
That was the one that moses dropped
We'll just use these other ones for a while, but that was the main one
But yeah, so when he's fab 60 is released for the second time
It's like a you could call it a non a non-plot episode of efap, right? There's no nothing dramatic happened
It was just a bit of lots of laughs so it can draw it can drop in at any point
And once it finally does it'll just be given a new number
Um, but it was fun and it's sad because we spent like an hour and a half ranking memes
supposed to be time but
It'll come back we found yeah, yeah, we found out that uh, just right is actually god-liked here. That was oh, yeah
He's been right. I didn't expect to see that but like yeah, and brown table's pretty damn high brown table
Just right and tonal. They're like our favorite three creators on efap now
Yeah, tonal was no surprise in his rank
the few that can't like okay, maybe just right can be kind of enraging but
Like tonal and brown table are just like you can't get mad at that. No, not at all. It's so much fun
I can't wait to see it. I'm doing more sad that i'm not seeing more tonal. Well, yeah, tonal hasn't made a video now in two months
It's like no
He's
Support tonal on patreon or don't
Be careful that he might fucking just not make anything because you know rags has been getting his monthly thrust denied
You know, he's not getting his monthly thrust and
If anything, that's something that everybody deserves to get if they're paying for it. That's that's my
Take if you will especially rags
um
Yeah, I suppose that that covers that
So yeah, like I said
The reason why I went into that tangent even though that doesn't seem like a tangent was me trying to introduce this episode
Which is efap 60 now
this one will be efap 60 efap 60 is now decanonized and it'll be recanonized because
We own the ip of efap. We haven't sold it to disney yet
So they can't decide but they will one day that's the that's the concern everyone has is the you know
A lot of efap will be decanonized second. I sell the rights to it. It's gonna be a gonna be a sad day
They just keep the the last few episodes people like no
Completely fucked up the continuity. Where are we gonna go from here? We do need a lot more diversity here
We need some representation and a little part of the toxicity around here a lot of male toxicity
What's kind of funny?
It's funny because if if disney did make an efap move you have to buy the rights they would if I was in it
I would probably be like, you know, it doesn't really matter what a thing is. It's only about how you feel about it
As long as it makes you happy
You ruined his character
The podcast is only an hour long. Yeah, the film is two hours. They're like, this is ridiculous makes no sense
um
But yeah, so welcome welcome guests the only the only we have a new person here
I'll introduce first instead of you other regular boring people. Um
Mr. Ryan kennel, is that how you pronounce that?
That that is how it's pronounced. Thank you. Thanks for having me man. Welcome to efap. Uh,
I suppose since since you're a guest I gotta be doing the thing you may be aware of this thing, but
I'll see that question
The wonderful quite which the question is going to be gone in a month's time now
I can't I don't think i'm ready for that question. Which character do I think is going to look
Consistent and rise of skywalker?
Is that the question that you could sort of trade the question out for like which one do you think will be ruined the most or
Which one do you think will be behaving the least like themselves the sort of thing?
But that's kind of what we're going for
Um, and you're not allowed to pick kylo palpatine or lando. They're disqualified
Um
God, you know, I I watched if I should have known I knew this question was coming i'd even think about it. But um
You know, maybe could it be fin or as fin is fin?
It would be crazy to me if fin had a different story than he had in the first two movies
I think they've just established he's going to be the same person over and over again
um
so
Maybe
Maybe it'll be fin. They'll they'll do the black guy dirty like he was complaining about on twitter
Oh, what do you reckon they'll do with him? That'll make him different?
Um, I think
He'll be white so he said
I think that
So to me fin is like such an empty person because he
We thought that he was going to be a big part of this trilogy and he's turned out not to be
So now I think they're going to force him to be an important part and try to get him to be with ray
For a lot of the time
Traveling around with her and I think it's not going to feel earned. Um
In a way, so maybe fin
That's my guess right now
Although that wouldn't really make him an inconsistent character though
Would it like at the at the time like he was still into ray and he was still doing that stuff
So yeah, that would actually be consistency within his character. Just not within his story
Yeah, I agree to be consistent within uh, especially like back to what we thought it was going to be with force awakens
and then last jedi everything
Went off the rails obviously and uh
He's falling around rose. Mike. I guess will rose even be in this movie or she's gonna get killed off immediately
Good question. I think honestly, I think she's gonna be
An important leader for some thing. She'll be contacted at some point. She'll have limited screen time, but she'll be doing great
She's just gonna be doing great. She's gonna be the secret skywalker or she'll be the new princess. Yeah
She's gonna be the secret skywalker she's the rise of skywalker rose tiko i'm telling you right now rose skywalker
Watch it y'all. They're here first on efap
This is even though there leaks out
There's still gonna be surprises even with leaks, you know, I think that we'll come out soon. We're like no way
with something or other who knows
Remember our conversations when we saw the game of thrones leaks and you and I both said there's no way it's this bad
There's no way. Yeah, it was it was worse in terms of watching the execution happen
But it was the leaks were 100 spot on it was just worse. Oh, yeah
I wish I could like find that clip. I remember reading them out and being like
fucking uh
Do you remember the one where it was like seriously execute smith sunday and it's like how the hell does that happen?
That makes no sense at all. Other than it did
You and I were streaming a few times over on keys and gamers and I remember us being vague about it with people
you know, we're like we've read them and they are horrific and people like
It can't be that bad and we're like if if this is even halfway true guys
This is going to be the biggest collapse in entertainment history and people like it
Were y'all watching the leaks when episode five, uh was around and did you like see the danny thing coming?
Oh, I think we knew all up
I'm pretty sure the leaks did specify that but it was the kind of thing where you read it and you go
Oh, they'll probably contextualize it a little bit better than that
Of course
Because I think what was it does it after episode three is when we read the leaks smaller
I think it was after three because that's when we gave up I believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think we were the same on that I was like i'm not gonna read
I'm not gonna read them and after three, I was like, no that's all done instead. I'll read them
It reminds me so much of what's going on right now where you're looking at you're like, I just don't give a shit anymore
Let's read it. Let's read the leaks. I have no interest in doing anything other than laughing and uh
I think that's what we'll be doing a little bit of today
Oh definitely and to clarify so you're going you're going for finna
Yeah, I think fin we'll go fin I don't know if i've heard him be
Well, I was actually gonna say I don't know if you're aware of this, but he's the most cobbidly voted
I'm one of the people who voted for him
There you go
I think the the thing with finn is they've never known what to do with him and in this film
It's going to be something completely different again. Like he's going to be this
Someone's going to be going on with him that will be like what?
I don't remember that being a thing. I feel like like po
He's probably just going to be guy who hangs out with them and then does good piloting at one point
Um, well, I don't want to say anything else because we're going to read the leaks which will disprove any speculation I have potentially but yeah
Who knows?
Yeah, and you know boyega actually just the other day he's been kind of crazy on twitter lately. It's been awesome
But uh just the other day he was talking on twitter
How he wished that he had had a bigger part and he thought that he was going to have like kind of a bigger role
And people started flooding him in the comments like hey
We did too like I hated last day. We wanted more of you and he's like, well, I didn't even know people felt this way
So it was really interesting to see that on twitter
It was uh, it's a really great window into how insulated a lot of the actors are from what the actual complaints are
Not the nonsense like I hate that there's so many women in this film. It's like no, it's not it's not that
It's like very much more specific and it comes from a place of appreciating the characters
We thought you would because yeah
I think most people would agree fin is probably the one with the most potential in the force awakens when you look at all
These characters you're like a rogue stormtrooper. Hell. Yeah
Give me played by john boyega as well. Oh, I mean, yeah, this is the thing
He's he's pretty damn good in everything that i've seen him do
It's just that he needs some scripts, man
He needs some scripts that are gonna get him doing some stuff. That's a lot more interesting than falling over and going whoa
Oh
Let's cast fucking john boyega as a rogue stormtrooper and then make him a clown
Like one one of these three things is not like the others
It's so disappointing but very few people literally, I mean, I don't think there's anybody that has any
Real following a real relevance that has had a blanket claim that it's there's too many women
It's the way that disney is, you know introducing it and the fact that that argument carries any weight to these
Nonsensical people that believe that it's rampant sexism is why people are upset with disney star wars is unbelievable
it's it's literally character assassinations and no respect for the source material and
An episode of the fact that it feels it feels like they specifically cast for diversity and not for story
when they began the sequel trilogy
And I guess that's why people now are looking at the mandalorian after two episodes and appreciating that it looks like they were
Casting for story and writing for story and not for a social commentary
And it's just not complicated to make good content when you are worried about the story and not the diversity aspect of it
Yes, very very grounded for now in terms of like there's nothing I can see in the first two episodes that are like
You're pulling me out in that in that regard
But I do want to wait a bit before I fully judge mandalorian
I was gonna say we we would talk about it, but rags has seen the first two episodes. So as soon as he arrives
Would be a better time to jump into that topic
So as long as everyone hangs out, you know for a decent amount of time as soon as he gets here
We'll cut right into a mandalorian discussion. It'll happen. It just uh
Yo, there's a transgender i'm calling it now. I need to like throw rocks at rags
Is anyone gonna really good throwing on looking like travel states? No
States
Why do I bring you guys on jesus maybe counties I don't know about states
I don't know that phone number yet
Well, here's the thing about um, like them casting for social commentary if they actually like were skilled and wanted to do social commentary
This isn't what they would have done. Anyway, it's just that sort of that whole like shallow thing of
Uh, oh, well if we have the like really shallow image of having social commentary
Then people will buy tickets if they wanted to do social commentary, they could have done it. Well
True
Absolutely
I mean well, what's better? What's better? Yeah, what's better for your social commentary to to put a a
Bland generic female character into a role with no story arc and and and no understanding of the the history or to actually
Put your female character in that honors the mythology honors the story and respects Luke skywalker
You know, I think that that does more for your diversity push, but they don't understand that they don't care
So, um, this wasn't necessarily planned but I do I it's just too funny not to put it on screen so, uh
Hey j since rags isn't here. Do you want to read this tweet out from movie bob? Oh sure. Oh, oh, no
Yes
So
I guess I guess we should we should read both of them
To be to be fader and give them all of the context j
Oh, there's three of them. There's really read what he's quote tweeting
um
Sure. Okay
The best thing about cap. Amelia is that he didn't just hold it once or swing it
He wielded it like a dam as guardian og makes me wonder if uh cap watch lowkey study
Hang on. What cap watch lowkey studying four skills in avengers post-battle tapes
Like uh mj on the dream team avengers endgame. So it's just some guy being happy about cap and mjolnir
All right makes enough sense
Bob comes in oh some gail. Sorry my bad
Yo, bob
And bob comes in it's gonna be such a moment when portman gets to lift this. Can you even imagine?
And like that on its own it's like all right bob whatever but the next one
I'm sorry
It's like oh, you know, uh when the character we've been following these 10 years left it that's okay
But when this like girl who's been in a couple of movies lifts it that's gonna be the big deal
People don't even know who she is. They've forgotten her character entirely
She was written out with a she was written out written out with a throwaway line and nobody cared. Nobody cared. No
Uh, in fact, it was funny when he's like, uh, she dumped me. I dumped her
It was a mutual dumping
Uh, but then he goes on to say call them not cinema if you like
But consider how the mcu has forever claimed milnea
Thor's hammer away from possible symbolic use by white nationalists or neo-nazis worldwide
And in the next one, they'll see it wielded by a jewish woman beside a black queer valkyrie
The only responses you're gonna have is just question marks. You're like what?
What what that's a that's a good response i'll respond to him with that now
I I love some of these responses, especially the image. This is nadia. Please just a crumb of pussy
People just like this the fuck did I just read this is my favorite response to it
Yeah, the 38 year old consumer
I see it
Don't ask quite yeah this movie bob he's such a fucking weirdo
Because like you have all these like characters in the in the what you could call critic sphere or just reviewing sphere
Whatever you want to call it
Like uh the night i'm talking about like all of us movie bob all the rest and stuff and it's just like he's that one guy
Where you're like, what the fuck is he saying?
and you
I was very concerned. He just says some stuff and I wonder if he ever like regrets his takes or if he just
Moves right along be like I was right feel regrets. That's you trying to say he's not human jay. That's very
I would love to be able to say that but unfortunately I have to accept him as one of my own
He's such a
strange man
Like because this is the thing if you had a friend who had that take about mjolnir never being in the hands of nazis
What even would you say?
Kind of representation
I just feel like why did you think it was
Why was it because is it because cap is white? Is that is that what's happening right now?
Maybe there is a thing of it is do we know definitive like
It's like I would believe from anyone else. Oh, yeah, sure. Maybe that was a thing. I just never heard of but it's bob
Yeah, like there's some comic line that happens
Yeah, i'm now really looking forward to all of the uh, all of the far right, you know
Neo nazis that are going to be, you know lifting the hammer just to spite movie bob at all their rallies
So let's look forward to that
Oh
Which um, they do not operate within reality. They really don't I suppose that leads me right into uh
The first topic of the day, which is to essentially recap
Now the efap audience may be aware of this but the last efap caused some trouble
Just a little bit some people are upset with it
Um as you may know
It was a strict 12 hours of mirags and wolf bashing jenny. We didn't talk about a video even it was just here
It was a paused frame and that's all it was it was tough. I'll admit we had you know energy drinks and um
We had to take like there was just these portions where after we'd spoken for two hours non-stop
We were like, you know, take a breath in make sure you
Get some breaks in but that happened. Um, and and we got in trouble on twitter. I say we uh
Wolf and rags don't have to deal with it because
I mean they made the wise decisions of not having twitter at that point wolf wolf actually got one back
During it. I think
I can't actually remember time to do that
Hmm what a great time. Oh, yeah
So wolf got a twitter account and he came back for his face fully efap the same time
We got the biggest drama we've ever faced
And he gets his twitter background the same time too
And like and he started dealing with some of these people and he got like a small suspension to nyx used to know know it
Oh, I wasn't aware of that. Yeah, did he already get a full suspension too?
Oh, yeah, you got you got one for the stupid ass reason but yeah
Well, I got one because someone reported me and then I wrote to twitter's like helpline and they just straight up re like
Gave me back my account immediately without sending any message which makes you think is there a reporting system automated? How does that work?
Mike well, I sent them context what I was saying to like prove that it wasn't just some like
um
random personal attack and then it was based in fact, so
I maybe that was what it did. But you know you since when does twitter care about that?
Fair enough. Um, but it was funny because uh, I was just chilling out and then I noticed suddenly the
Like the the ratings on the last efap had like
Well, plummeted and I was like, what the hell?
Did like do we piss off a bunch of the audience with covering jenny or something?
I was like, I don't think they didn't seem to care in the live chat that much like the
You know, some people can be defensive if you cover a certain creators
And I think that's totally natural. So I was just like maybe we we stepped on a niv with jenny
But I was like, oh all the top comments are still positive
Like the yeah, I noticed that too
I was like, where's this coming from and then and then uh
Just looking around and found out that jenny had tweeted out the stream or at least a screenshot of it
And she was like someone made an 11 hour
A video on me. It was like oh
Oh, no
Because when you when you're a very popular
Pearson and you make a tweet like that
The second I saw I was like, oh we're gonna be dealing with a lot of messages now
a lot of
A lot of assumptions and that's that's what I had to get to work for a good
I was editing batman episode five batwoman episode five when I was dealing with twitter stuff
It was such a bizarre tonal shift going back and forth with twitter
because
You go back to like ruby rose delivering a horrible line or some stupid plot point that makes no sense and everyone laughing at it
But then back to you run an alt right nazi podcast where you hit women's feelings regularly. It's like, oh
but
you know
natural internet experience, uh, what do you get to this point of
I don't know guy if you have you guys done this before criticized a woman. Have you done that?
Uh, I I tried to declare you're not supposed to do that. Well, that's what I was saying
I was saying have you ever done it? Like I know you're not supposed to
From what I understand efap specifically only focuses on women according to jenny nicholson's fans. That's what i've heard
Well, and uh, i'm a little upset and a little triggered right now
Oh, i'm so sorry. I mean ultimately like, you know, what am I supposed to do?
She she didn't tell me she was a woman before we went after her
You're supposed to do that
Um, but yeah, well, I mean like
Well, I mean just like being within the the star wars, uh, you know criticism right now
They they will say that we only focus on like criticizing ray and rose and kathleen. Kennedy
But we pretty much criticize ryan johnson every day, you know
We're not fans of a lot of the characters whether they're male or female
But it's when they can build that narrative around a woman and they can just pretend that you're woman hating and I saw this happen
I mean you guys covered nothing but men for the most part when you fat you cover a prominent female once and you're all of a sudden
Just building your entire
Uh, you know show around hating women
That's how it goes and
yeah, just
Like a lot a lot of labels floating around and I was just gonna say like
Like we're bullies. We humiliate people and we're we're like in cells and stuff and i'm just like
Calling rags an incel. Really? I don't know
It doesn't really match up. But then the whole like humiliate part is just like we listen to people's videos
If they humiliate it's not our fault
We didn't force no bullshit to say that it was sjw to have a large midget in in infinites war
He said that on his own volition
Um, but he was he was a guy so it didn't matter like that, you know doesn't
Besides he's one of the people they probably hate anyway, so
Um, but yeah, I was just going to show you some some random comments
Um, the way I started seeing on the video because I was like wait, what's happening?
um
I don't up to you. We'll start with a
Almost ambiguous one. Do you guys think this is serious or a troll because I i'm still undecided
I don't know if it's just poorly spelled or if it's trolling
Should I read it or uh, go ahead
As if I want to see more videos of men mansplaining things to women
You should be ashamed of yourselves and hide behind the rocks
That's a troll
No, it's hard to tell it's hard to tell it is hard to tell I don't know
It's on the it's like the straddling the line. It's like
behind the rocks
I love it
Um, that is hard to tell but either way that's the beauty of it. Mm-hmm. That's the beauty of it
So it's got to be a troll john snow 1 5 4 6 5 2 1. That's his name
I mean you could have you could be a guy out there with that name like why not? I don't know
He's only a fantasy's name
All right
I'm checking out chat. Are we thinking troll? It seems I think I think most people assuming it's a troll. It's fine
Let's check out
Uh, I don't know. Jeremy. Do you want to do the honors for this one?
John snow again
The stream is a bunch of mean-spirited personal attacks against a fun and friendly youtuber who is popular and weird
And unique and makes a lot of fresh and fun content. How many ands can you put? Oh my god?
Um, i'm not with the canceled culture
I just realized I haven't hit read more. I'm pretty sure this one was really funny and I and I accidentally
Snipped it without hitting me
Damn it
You got another one you want to you want to yeah, I do have I have a backup one
So have fun with this one. Jeremy screw that one
There we go
All right, here we go, uh maddie doggo
You spit 11 fucking hours six of which related to the video about some youtuber god damn your
Apathetic fucking joke hilarious that you have literally
I hate everything and the fury so
In the closet, what the fuck? Uh in the closet. He missed
Guessing any time a woman exists
Whatever here comes the 12-hour response to a youtube comment. Hope your channel burns and you
also
I don't even need the rebar though. That's just great. Okay, that one's real. I
Think that was real myself. That one's real
So deep in the closet. He missed the turn to narnia. That's a good line. That's a good line
I just think that any time a woman exists you cry like a bitch
What
Hope your channel burns and you
Yeah, also
A bad rep mauler's biggest crime he gives a gas mask a bad rep
Um
So it's got another one. I don't know ryan. Do you want to check this one out?
Oh, yes
Oh from matt frank 11 hours this thing
Is 11 hours long
I started listening to it and
It was so weird, but I could actually see my own life shortening
The precious grains of sand that gently flow through the hourglass of life actually sped up for me
I was literally dying faster as I listened to whatever the hell this is supposed to be
Anyway, joker was kind of bad
I love that. That one's that one's fake. That one's fake. That was fun. Anyway jokes kind of bad
I
Good cinematography though
This is what I mean like
There's lots of just the 11 hours thing and I got confused by because the video was 11 48
So you'd think they'd go with 12 wouldn't you but the narrative was 11?
I guess they gave us that 48 minutes as oh, that was probably time they spent, you know with intros and outros
Well, you know, they they glimpsed. They basically glimpsed that too. So
Yeah, I didn't
Take the time to
The glimpse the 11 part of it. They're like, yeah got it
And that was that was the thing that was so ridiculous about this whole thing that was going on on twitter like
The people would be like I can't believe they spent 11 fucking hours complaining about a woman and then you or someone else would say
Uh, you know the whole 11 hours wasn't about that. It was about this this this this and this and they're like
You think I would actually watch it
That's the response they just admitted they have no idea what they're talking about
Who's that columnist the new york columnist verified on twitter that retweeted you guys and was like, uh,
Imagine being this upset about who was that? Do you remember his name? There was some cock from the huffington post. Yeah
I remember I cover the name. But yeah, I simply retweeted him. I can't remember his name
Uh, let's say his name was john for instance. I said she's not going to fuck you john
Talk to nickelson because that's these people are so pathetic
So, uh after after a bit after that we got this this thread got made on reddit
I don't know if you guys have heard about this one because I tweeted out because I was blown away by the existence of this
Like so fucking dishonest but
Funny to say the least i'll link
I can link you guys it but obviously uh, it's
Down for now
Yeah, it got shut down after you retweeted it. Is that what it was?
Yeah, and don't don't mention the only fucking comment that's still there because i'm gonna i'm gonna reveal that to the audience
because I know they'll love it but uh
Yeah, like uh, so just so people can see it. It looks like this like the thread but the thread read
A red pill youtuber makes an 11 hour long response to a jenny nickelson video where she gave her opinion on why she didn't like joker
so like
red pill like where the hell did this come from like
And um, yeah, like the account that made this fucking hates efap
Uh, there was like a a lot of comments in relation to it. I was just like, oh my goodness like
You you me and rags will be infinitely surprised at how much people despise us. Um
We shouldn't be but you know this exists. Uh, luckily the the when you make a thread on on reddit
It's like permanent or it can be archived or whatever
Um, so so I can still we can check out some of the comments on it in a second
But um, I was gonna take like the the the top comments are just filled with how disgusting and horrible we all are pretty much and um
Reading through it was interesting because it was just like any of you seen it
Any of you seen it?
Just just put up a hand
No, no, no, no, I mean any of the comments have they seen
the show
And uh, because I really wish I would have read this uh
Really with the show would have read the I remember when you posted it
I just didn't click on it, but I would have loved to have seen but um the reason it got booped
Was because it broke rule one, which is content must depict an embarrassing interaction between two or more people
Now it was between three people
So it wasn't that it was that it didn't depict an embarrassing interaction
Um, it wasn't this is on cringe the subreddit and the the moderators I guess decided that this is not cringe
so
Rip I guess like there's nothing more satisfying than knowing that the guy who made that thread who hates efab was told that
It's not cringe
So, yeah all that remains on the thread, um, I mean you guys have already seen this if you've looked at that link
but i'll just show the audience is uh
One comment that says, uh, just as the spiders foretold
Fucking greatest meme ever for this thread
Like
I don't know how that happened, but it's like the best thing ever
It's the only one standing amongst a sea of removal
Like the you know, obviously the mods saw that they're like, oh, yeah, no you can't you can't delete comments about the spiders predictions
I like to think that's what happened. I like to think it was a mod who knew about efab and thought
Stay
The fucking mob is a fan of efab. Yeah. Yeah, he used a dog whistle. Hey, that's how we can wake regs up
Oh, yeah, do it
Everybody shoot up your dog whistles. That's that's what you do with the dog whistle you shoot them up
Anyway, uh, so if you guys click this it's essentially like
Gets you into a reddit thread that's been deleted and oh wait, why has it changed now?
They've all been censored
What oh no wait, they're back. They're back. Oh god for a moment
I was like the whole point of view is to show us things that get deleted not delete them
um
So you got top comment, which is pretty fair. Yeah, i'm not watching this. It's like yeah, that's fine
I wouldn't ask anyone to watch a level hour stream just out of randomness. But um
Then you got how dare someone not like something I do and lots of other people's do I must pwn this crap in with my immense brain
So that's how they see discussion now interesting
Like uh, we didn't say she was wrong for disliking joker. Anyone can dislike it. It's all good
Then you start to cycle down a bit more. Um
Oh, yeah
I'm skipping over all the responses by the way because there's a shit ton of arguments about how like this is wrong
Because there's a lot of efab fans who do not like this, uh being the the narrative
Uh, jesus christ ain't nobody got time for that. It's like
I don't know. It's just over 100k views at this point like some people do
um
Uh, let's see, but this is the whole thing about it
I mean, why am I why are you and I and wolf and rags or why are we friendly now mainly because wolf?
You know put me in a video on something. He didn't know opinions of mine. He didn't like and I responded
The way I respond and then wolf was like, oh, yeah, like, you know, we were cool
We had a discussion about it. You know what I mean? And like I told you I was claiming like I met him by taking a shot
so
pal, I was gonna I was gonna work into that because when we had the discussion about
You know how he and I met and then ultimately got to come on efab. Uh, you told me how you guys met
Conversations are not attacks
Challenging your opinion is not an attack
It's it's discussion and you can either choose how you want to handle that and if you want to play the victim
You you clearly can do that. You can always paint that narrative around it
But i'm sure
That if she wanted to have a discussion about her opinion with you
And you guys sure you would have it. She doesn't want that. Well thinking about it. This wasn't actually planned
I just thought it was like you and jay both technically people who
And now have come on here semi-regularly and regularly and uh, you started out as being people who could be considered antagonist to a degree
Uh differing degrees, but it's just interesting how that
Happened and then other things can happen
Uh, for example, i'm not watching 11 hours of red pill bullshit. I can guarantee this is cringe
The entire subculture is cringe. We're some fairies because at least fairies don't shoot up mosques or schools when they're not getting laid
Like if you if you watch the efab when we're talking about that and we're making all these jab memes and just hanging out
having fun then that's someone's takeaway you'd be like, uh
Ah jab those school children must pay
Yeah, then you've got like
Comment we're starting to get to this all comments now that are like, hey, this isn't actually what you're saying it is
And then like molar is a red pillar
Like ball is a black pillar
He's in more of an alt right capital g gamer i'm like the quartering uh clean prince gaming apparently, okay
Um
It never comes to the conclusion after watching one of his videos it's because yeah
Red pill is the whole like
Uh, what is what is the base does anyone here know what like the basic tenets of a red pillar are?
Well, I think it's in reference to the matrix
No people people in the comments were saying it was you are a men's rights activist
Um, yeah
I don't remember that coming up
But maybe it's because we criticize jenny and she is a woman therefore. We hate women and love men. That must be the uh
The through line there very solid
Yeah, I mean like
I think it's clear that this is not a red pilled podcast if you look at what you titled the stream molar
Um, it says rep pilled podcast. Oh, no
So you're definitely not red pilled. Uh, you don't even know how to spell it. So I think that's
You know
You know what i'm gonna change it as chat has honestly well suggested it should be jab pilled that is
Oh
Someone in the someone in the reddit thread here is on it. They're like, um, you're you're confused. They're not red pills
They're ends. They're just in cells
Okay
I love the idea. They're like i'm helping you efaps like no, you're not okay
I don't know if they thought they were helping or not. Well, that's true. Yeah
Rep pilled it was setting the record stream. Maybe they thought that was nice
You know, I I shouldn't complain it's better than the rest of it. I suppose
um
Yeah, unlike look at the god I used to watch rags not proud of it. It's like wow
There's so fun
I saw one that's like I think his force awakens intro or his criticism with the force awakens intro video
It's longer than the film itself. That boy ain't right
That's all
I mean if you put all the time you've talked about anything
To like one selection and it turns out to be longer than the thing itself. You need help guys. You need help
Can't be doing that. Okay
I can't talk about moments in a movie without it going longer than the moment itself and therefore you're bad and need help
toxic
What if you just like you're you're disabled and you can't speak fast. That's not an ability you have
Nope, you're psycho. Look at this. It must be hard being a female youtuber when you have things like this happening
What we've we've got after 95 percent men
No, no, they're saying it must be difficult for her because she's a woman. Oh, because women are weak because women
Yeah, okay. If only I was a man and strong enough to take criticism
Someone says excuse me a woman had an opinion. I need to go screech for 11 hours straight
And then someone responds. I don't appreciate you misgendering angry joe
Oh, yeah, because we cover him for a portion of the uh
This is it though that they believe they believe women can't stand with their own opinions
They believe they have to have white knights come after them
They they discredit women every time they have an opinion they don't agree with I just posted, you know
But this video the yeah that darth barbie posted her last why don't like last jedi in the comments
You're letting jeremy from geek to gamers influence you
What?
Focus because if a woman has an opinion that says the last jedi sucks
You must not have came to that opinion herself must be the toxic man
And then like a woman can't be a youtuber because you can't criticize her
It's so tough for them
I'm just thinking I don't know if you've seen her video guys get more hate than anybody
Oh, yeah
Well, um, I think lindsey alice recently came out talking about how horrible it is to have like onslaught of people
Ragging the shit out of you and then getting to the point where they stop you from being able to have friends
Of difficult political positions, which is something that happens to guys as well
No matter what political fucking position you hold and it's just like you guys, you know kind of did that to us
But okay, you know, we're fine. We'll laugh it off
uh because most of this is coming from people who literally have no fucking clue what the video is or who I am or who rags is so
like it can't actually
Get to us on a personal level because it's not actually entered into the personal realm yet. They based it off a thumbnail
Which is kind of an interesting social experiment, right?
It's like could you just make up a thumbnail post it to cringe and be like look at these people beard
gross
People like wow
Were they men? What if they'd hang on like the title was
Red pill youtuber. What if wolf and rags because they wouldn't have known what if those two were women?
No, that doesn't that doesn't matter. Well, i'm i'm sure the poster was familiar with efap, right?
Um, yeah, the poster was
But he says a red pill youtuber. He didn't even specify that i'm a guy
I guess if you respond to jenny nicholson you have to be a guy like why else would you is that the
This is complicated. Okay. I'm trying to keep track of the rules
Right now
It's a never-ending rabbit hole of nonsense
Dude, you're trying to you're trying to keep up with consistent rules here. Come on, dude. I'm sorry
It's just not it's just not going to work. It's it's a fruitless endeavor. Just stop
um
Yeah, we had
so that the huffington post guy, um
Cosmonaut variety hour linkara, um some theories
lots of
uh, I guess well known like twitter people because they were getting like
100 000 thousands upwards of tens of thousands of like
Likes and retweets about how terrible efap is and i was just like how is this happening like?
Is it just that that's how much a screenshot can spread I guess. Um
But uh, I do want to mention linkara and cosmonaut variety. I both
Pulled their shit back. They were like, okay
May have jumped the gun. This is clearly not entirely what I thought it was
But you can see why I assumed it was right and it's just like yeah
But you're wrong and it's like, okay good
So though I may have actually watched it. Hmm
and uh, yeah, the uh linkara removed his
His blog about how terrible it was and I think cosmonaut just put out a tweet saying that yeah, he was wrong
Um, so that was cool. It doesn't doesn't happen often, but uh, we got there with two people
out of the thousands
Progress, it's full steps guys. Okay, so you make it sound like it's impossible, but it's possible
Um, yeah, I saw linkara come out and I immediately linked. Uh,
Medikir's I think is that guy with the glasses episode three. Oh, man. That's
Green mmm. I don't know what the fuck to think about that. Uh
It's just another uh twitter take
um
Yes, who hasn't read stuff that's bullshit now you got to do it
all right
As somebody who actually has watched a couple of efap streams all the way through
And has sat through a couple hours of maller's content. I can tell you right now that they are not even worth touching
It's content for people who think cinema sins is funny and follows people like ben shapiro and steven crowder
Like their words are gospel. It's worthless content and they are garbage people
So a couple things, right?
Yeah
One of our most consistent guests got started on youtube by ripping into cinema sins
Yes
That that's a thing like I do not get this take that it's like oh they're like citizens people
It's like no, we don't like cinema sins. We have lots of issues with cinema sins like
Okay, are there where does this shapiro and crowder thing come from like what?
What it's the classic right there. That's the paint to paint you the the conservative alt writers right there
That's where that comes from
It's like ben shapiro is a fucking clown
that's
Well, then apparently we're clowns jay. How do you feel?
Ben shapiro stars in joker
I'm not political
And and that's the thing it's the everything everything turns into incel nazi alt right whatever it may be when
First of all the alt right hates ben shapiro for reasons
Obviously, uh, they hate steven crowder. They're they're constantly at odds
So just the the constant trying to lump people in with all these groups of people that you think other people hate
As a way to discredit them. It's just disingenuous and shitty
I mean they they don't like crowder and you know shapiro's then they're like, oh, here's another group of people
I don't like these people must be connected to the other people. I don't like
They must be fans. They must be supporters because everything in my mind has to connect everyone in the same boat
They all are toxic and they're all far writers. Jeremy. Do you want to jump on this one? I think you'll like it
Sometimes the toxic nature of straight white men on youtube will never cease to amaze me
Imagine hating on the best youtube channel of all time
for 11 hours straight
And being this passionate about a fucking clown movie
Fragile men are simply a disease. There's no other
explanation
Wow, so jenny nichol said has the best youtube channel of all time. Hmm. Not bad
And damn it sucks being born a white man because you just got a toxic nature
There's gotta be a way to get rid of that right guys. There's gotta be a way
Yeah, so imagine being this passionate about a fucking clown movie. Yeah, imagine being the media
Hoping for a mass shooting around a clown movie and then being disappointed when it didn't happen because that's the type of nonsense
The clown movie has been the fucking talking. What the I don't even like this. I
Was the space wizard movie it's like give me any movie
Then i'll just you could just find a thing in the movie be like oh, it's the that movie
Exactly. Exactly. You can take that build that narrative around anything. I mean, I love toy story for instance
Oh, I can't believe he's passionate about a fucking toy movie
Yeah, I mean literally any movie you can build that narrative around it's just nonsense
I don't know like what's the most like serious film that ever existed and then we just have to find something stupid in the film
Like so a guy reading a book and be like fucking book movie
Okay
Meanwhile meanwhile
Imagine being this passionate about a youtube channel that you don't like which is what this person's doing
They're upset that that someone's passionate about a fucking clown movie yet
They're showing equal passion for a youtube channel that they don't even understand
Just because of a headline that they're looking at and not taking time to read the context and of course you're all straight white men
um
No
Because that's fact everybody who disagrees is a straight white man and you're toxic
And you're an alt writer. It's my favorite thing when people like try to go. Oh you fucking straight white man to
Uh to someone to try and discredit them and they're wrong
Well, like what like the fact that fucking both rags and wolf are not straight white men. So
The yeah, what when you know, they're not straight or they're not white or fuck it, you know, they they've recently come out as trans
Oof, that would be really awkward then when they because then they'd be in trouble like
too much assumptions
But um, I mean one thing I've noticed with uh, you know being a member of the fandom in us and and even obviously with geeks and gamers
Is uh, if you are not a straight white male, uh that has an opinion that they disagree
They just don't acknowledge your existence at that point
You know, they're either going to brand you a straight white male
For your opinions regardless if you are not then they find out if you have a prominent voice and you you know
Say oh, I don't like this movie or I'm not against that or i'm not for this
They just don't acknowledge your opinions if they can't build their nonsense around it
They just you're irrelevant to them at that point
Or they go the extra step and they call you either like a race trader or a
Right. Mm-hmm internalized blank
So they can use the word still yeah, so it's like yeah, it's like so uh internalized homophobia and there you go
A gay man is now the enemy
Exactly. Um, so it wasn't all bad. Uh, there was some
Fucking hilarious takes on twitter. I've never seen before I do not believe this guy is a troll
I think that we've found what is one of the most
Like genuine boomers in the wild. So i'm gonna read this one out because it's too fucking funny
But uh, so this is during the whole jenny thing
Someone weighs in on the conversation about effep
I don't understand how these people got youtube accounts in the first place
What youtube executive decided to pick up these shows? How did these people slip through the interview process?
Do you uh
Do you think do you think that's how it works, mate?
I assume they either self-finance pilots to pitch to youtube or get funding from television distribution companies
Or produce on spec scripts same as any shows on netflix or nbc or whatever
It's youtube. You just sign up for an account and you're good. Literally anyone can do it
You can't just make your own videos, dude
Cameras and sound recording equipment and lighting equipment mixing boards cost tens of thousands of dollars
Not to mention the cost of film stock videotapes or transmitting to broadcaster. I worked in this stuff in the 90s
You have to be trying
Come on
Oh my goodness, i've never seen someone so lost before
I can confirm my channel has over 200 000 and I have a 75 web cam from target and i'm very proud of it
Wait, who produced that? How did you get funded who approved of your show idea?
Yeah, I mean I had to go there was a there was it was a really strict process
I had to go through six months of background checks, uh drug tested every single day
even tested for the uh
You know the type of drinks that I couldn't drink soft drinks for six months during the approval process going to youtube
Uh couldn't masturbate which really sucked
It was really it was a tough time. But hey, I i'm here now
And those six months of hell it's all worth it
So thank you to you for approving me and by the way, susan is great. Susan is wonderful. All hell susan
Yeah, well, that's that's all well and good. But come on, dude
You do that exactly you actually spoke to them
I mean, I I spoke to youtube. I mean they they came to my house. They blindfolded me
Okay, beat me and gagged me for about six to seven minutes
I woke up I woke up in uh, like a it was just a padded room
Uh, and susan walked in with sunglasses. She never took her sunglasses off and grilled me for about 45 minutes mainly by voting preferences
Uh, you know am I gonna support bernie things like that? Uh, you know, what what how did epsin die?
And clearly i'm still here today so I said the right things well, I was just gonna say it was really stressful the day
I walked into the board of directors and I was like, I just put a big white board and I just put efap on there
And then they were like
What's that? I'm like, let me tell you a story
There for a good few hours
But yeah, I got funding and I got 100 episodes approved and we're waiting to see if we've got the next 100 in the next
Few weeks. So how about that?
Are there specific questions or are you alt right nazis? Okay, cool. We approve of those all the time. Yep. Yep
Up you go
Yeah, jay was there obviously as manager. He uh
Was was was given a lot of the reins in terms of in terms of how I was on I was one of the people interviewing you
That's how I became manager. Yeah, you you saw the potential you were like guys. This is gonna work. This this is i'll pick this show up
Can imagine think imagine thinking a youtuber has to go through the process
The only way any youtuber can get youtube's attention is to go on twitter and tag them and have your followers retweet
So you can get an answer from them
You have to go through that process even markiplier for crying out loud can't get youtube to talk
I just like
Imagine this guy down and showing him like how youtube works and how you do it and how simple it all is
I could just be a hit see him being like oh my god
I'm gonna be like, why did they get the cameras though?
Does it make sense?
I assume they're either self-financed pilots to pitch to youtube like
If you look through youtube and see all of the idiots on here
All of us that are just uploading whatever we think and that's the assumption you come out with
There's no way that this dude is any less than 70 or 80 years old
There's no possibility
I mean most people say he's he's old or or he's just uh
Fake like he's a troll and i'm like, I don't know man
It's a good troll if it's if it is a troll because I it's just it's how that person would behave if that person existed
The one who worked in tv in the 90s and then was put on pause until now
Like what is this internet you're all talking about? It's probably says seventh generation new yorker
It's that that's consistent with what we've seen, right?
I wonder if he ever like this was the day he's been on twitter for ages that he was just like
I should look into this youtube thing
Oh, you know what it was it's what he probably saw all the late night shows on youtube and he was like, oh, yeah
Yeah
stuff like minefield and yep
That's like when my when my grandma found out that I had a youtube channel she text me how did you get on tv?
That is exactly the response I expected this person would also have
Ooh rags has notified me. I believe he may be here
Hey
Rags isn't real
What wait, is he not?
Did he get one? Is he just like some little puppet I have then in the in the efab like board room
I had the ef thing and then I had like a wolf and rags puppet and I was like this movie
So this this video is so bad. He's just very very like what do you think?
It's true
um
All right, he he is on zuwe
Uh, let's see. I think I think we're near the end of the twitter saga. Um
Oh, yeah, this one's cool. So, uh, this is a nice one I got on the on the the jenny
Oh, no, not that was the it was the following batwoman mini. So, um
I don't know who wants to read this out. It's a nice one. I'll take it
I must apologize to you lads a couple days ago. I fell for some reddit crap
Framing you as incels and made an unpleasant
Comment on your video. Let me move this over. Hang on. There's something in my way here. Sorry
And made an unpleasant comment on your video after watching a few hours of your content. I can admit I was wrong
My bad lads my bad. No, so I just want to make sure i've gotten the story straight so far. Okay, that's not
Oh, yeah, that's fine. Uh
Because long shanks is very invested in us covering batwoman. Uh, he's
He's ready to come yeah, but so like just the idea that um
This probably didn't work out very well for the people who hate efap
Like we would have we had a bump in in subs and it's what it's our second most popular episode now. So thanks
Um, and we'll we'll get over the incel comments. It's not really something that's gonna bother us
They destroy everything that they try to help and then they help everything they try to destroy
I mean
Like look the joker, you know bill your first billion dollar film, you know rated r film
um, they they all these crazy lunatics
obsessed with identity politics and
Uh white men being the the most awful things in the planet
They they complained about the joker and all they did is elevate it all they did is help efap
Gave you guys some of the best traction you've had ever so yeah, which like I said, thanks. Thanks
I guess and the the twitter war was worth it. I guess and obviously, um
thank you to a lot of the people including ryan and jeremy and j and
uh
There's there's lots of names
I don't want to try and name them because i'm gonna miss people and then i'll feel like an asshole
so all the people who lent a hand and uh
Looked into all this nonsense during those fun times on twitter. Uh, thank you very much
I appreciate it and it all has calmed down until of course we cover jenny again, which
when
When that happens after wonder how soon that'll be it sucks because like we pretty much capped it with that one the 12-hour cap thing
Like we can't really go further. I was like, oh, let's do a fucking 24-hour jetty stream
But uh, uh, yeah, it's been it's been fun. Hello rags. How'd you do?
Hello, um, I do well
we've been uh
Recanting the fun times that twitter had us had for us
Yeah, we had a we had a great time and um, um
Rarely does a day go by where I say man. I really I really miss being on twitter. Mm-hmm
I was watching some of that in parts and i'm just all like I can't be bothered to even read all of this
Fuck twitter, dude
Oh, yeah special mention I guess for uh for anna that star wars girl
She actually made a video covering this going over how ridiculous the whole thing was like appreciate that as well
Um, luckily the narrative just died like it just didn't work for very long because the second you look into it, right?
And this is the funny thing that um, I had a lot of people talking about so it's framed as a horrible sexist
Monster in cell podcast and the um in the opening 10 minutes me and wolf are discussing how much we love buffy the vampire slayer
It's like like so people who've been sent there to hate it and they're like fucking i'm so ready to rip into this and they're
Listening and they're like talking about how much they like buffy. Okay, that's sexist
Probably
And um
Yeah, you could skip around and you can there was a guy I don't know if you any of you saw it on twitter
But there was a guy who made that four minute compilation of all the worst things we said
Which involves stuff like she's she's being retarded or she looks kind of like an android or the lighting isn't good
It was just four minutes and then and then like basically every comment was like so what about the other 11 hours and 44 minutes?
Is there anything else in there?
Um, yeah
Is that the one where they clipped anna's stream also yes, and um, it didn't it didn't work out very well
shell in
Um, one of the points she made I just wanted to highlight this was funny
One of the points she made is that she went into a drive-through viewing of joker and she said the reason for that is in case
There was a shooter
Oh my god, so you might have the question as we did
You'd get that your car doesn't stop a shooter, right? Like
That like that's a weird line of logic and she was asked that on her video and that was her response. Um
If it's not showing up. Oh, yeah, there it is
It said uh, jenny
Uh, you do know that cars aren't bulletproof, right windows, especially not bulletproof and she said car drive over man with gun
Now i'm sure that'll work great
Just talk about conveniences
Uh, so the man decided to not only allow you to start up and drive your car forward into him
But he also stood in front of it as well
Like this this shoot doesn't sound very intelligent, but all right if that's how it works out, you know
Yeah, I think that's one of those those fantasies people have in their head
That they have when they haven't considered reality in any way shape or form
I'm sorry. No, I refuse to believe that that's her actual that that was her actual thought process
Oh, i'll i'm gonna go to a drive-in one
Uh, so if there's a shooter I can run them over
like that's
That's how justifying it after the fact there's no way that's actually what she thought at the time
I think this is shooting at the drive-in theater. I was just fucking run him over with my car
I just assumed she realized it didn't make sense and then she was like I could defend it this way
Then she probably read that back was like oh fuck
It's just the person that assumed or said that it was a bunch of men clapping in the theater, um
Weird weird common. You know this I know a woman's clap. I'm a woman. I know what a woman's clap sounds like
For anyone that's been to a drive-in
Getting out of there is the biggest pain in the ass in the world because there's a million cars trying to drive through a little area
It's exactly the same as a theater a crowded theater trying to get out
So I don't even think she actually went to a drive-in
But uh, I guess we can't oh you reckon she didn't even go to one. Yeah, like
I think she's just saying that well for me. I just be like, did you go to one?
She's like yeah, and i'm like, okay, that's fine
But like you didn't go there to prevent a person from shooting you right? That's a really weird thing to say
Overall, it's just the the whole takeaway is that she thought that the articles were real about people
That's going to shoot this movie up and really that's
Just ridiculous on its own. Honestly, she's a gullible lady then
Um
So, yeah, I was just gonna
Yeah, so just the amount of uninformed people I think that's the general takeaway
Like every person we saw on twitter talking about that. I saw people being like it's clearly some sort of sexual reference
It's called efap. I can't believe they're talking about it. I'm here like that
Just people have no idea what's going on. We let the audience name it and by god
They came up with a clever name. Like what can I say?
It's it's like it's like three layers of referential like we couldn't we we had like a poll
We had some good ideas, but efap had just won and I remember when I announced it on twitter
It was a guy was like, I don't know man
That's um kind of makes you kind of it kind of brings your podcast into like it was like a sexual podcast
And I was like, yeah, that's the point though. It's so great
Like wait
There's a podcast called efap that covers video essays and discusses like philosophy and ideas about themes and breakdowns
Thousands of people watch it. It's called efap. Like I don't know
It's the thing you just don't believe
That's what's so wonderful about is about family
Efap's about family
That's the theme
Fucking with other people's families. We have all of the themes in uh in efap
so
Uh, there was a guy I call this by chance and he has no idea i'm probably going to do this
Um, but I thought it was an interesting video. He made an edited version of the stream
Which i'm now going to place into the description if you guys want to see
Which basically just has all of the arguments presented and counted from jenny
Uh, well from us from jenny if that makes sense. Um
it comes to
three hours 19 minutes
So that's how much we time we actually spent on it
Um still monsters agreed still disgusting creatures, I know
but um
I'll give you guys a link to the
Watch together. We're gonna he made like a little commentary video about it
We're just gonna check out like the first half of it because I was amused by it
So if everyone jumps in
If you haven't used watch together before it's just you just click that and you're
Dropped into like a room where i'm gonna play a video and
You can change the volume for yourself. It won't affect anyone else's but if you pause it pauses for everybody. Um
Funny pandas epic laughs. I don't know why that it I don't know why that makes me giggle every time
Fucking pandas, dude
Whenever I whenever I see that the the epic laughs, I remember years and years ago how epic fail was the big thing
Ah, yes, yes
Epic laughs is the new thing
Yeah, just uh, just check us out and then we got a meme video
That's specifically about the twitter thing and then I will happily say that at the end of the twitter thing
But not quite yet. Hi, my name is car and I am human anyways today
I wanted to talk about something that has been bothering me for a while now at the beginning of november of
2019 a video stream was presented by the epheb crew
Consisting of molar wolf and the episode's guest rags
The topic of the stream was jenny nicholson's video titled
Well, I didn't like joker and while the stream itself lasted 11 hours the part that addresses jenny's video
Itself is only three hours and 60 minutes. How do I know that?
Well, I cut it up
I cut the whole thing up and here the six simple steps
I had to go through first step download the video and put it in the editing software step two rough cut the jenny part step three
Cut the remaining five or six hours into half hour segments because my editing software was on fire
It didn't want to work step four and five cut all the stuff that wouldn't impact the statements made double statements dead air size
Breathing and other stuff with precision cuts cut all the things that could be considered offensive
And topics that had nothing to do with the video. I'm looking at you rah and you fucking rooftop
So no one can claim
Long my bad. Are we cool? Did anyone get that? Can you tell that this was very tedious work probably can't
And while I try to cut as much as possible
I have this strange feeling that sometimes I made precision cuts like a surgeon and sometimes I just butchered the video
All right. Now that we got all that out of the way
Let's move on to the thing. I actually want to talk about I think I would like to
Baptize efap period and yes, this is a fucking sexual joke. This video is not for kids
I'm also extremely pissy right now. So shut the fuck up
So what is the efap period the efap crew reacts to an bad take on the internet
The creator of the video either a comes on the podcast and the people talk it out
Like a painless period or b doesn't come on the podcast and a just stay silent
Which was would be like a math period or b pulls along and bad
For those who don't know what along and that is here's a quick explanation
Some guy made an 11 hour response
Wow, that's only likes tweet count. We don't use this word
Maybe that's that's a we are a pill of a scary color
But in this case, I would say jenny is actually not a bad one in this story
Yeah
Believe it or not
Because I checked the original tweet from jenny and she just didn't want
To watch the video because she takes the land for the video automatically implies that the view is unstructured
Well, I can't understand and that is why I cut the whole thing up. It's on the internet
You should look it up. Check it out. Probably also in the description. I don't know i'm tired
I just want to get this done. So why jenny did pull a long man bad
She didn't felt defended from what I could see and she didn't send anyone to harass the efap crew
so
Yeah, the negative reception came actually from the people that engage with miss nicolson's content
Here's a problem though on the internet. I never know if someone is trolling me or not
So I just assumed they're trolling me a hundred percent of the time
But but there was one tweet that brought the spotlight to the thing. I actually want to talk about
a tweet from comfy with lexie
They watched literally like 10 to 15 seconds of her video before saying she looks like a murderer
She looks like an android except no some androids are nice looking
They also said I never seen her before but I know I never want to see another video from her
I assume this is that's something your side would never say. No, I might be wrong here, but
But but hear me out
These parts of the video don't make the criticism less valid. I cut them out because
I could definitely see why someone could see them or deem them as offensive. I think that offense can only be
Taken never given you can call someone a murderer
And if that person isn't a murderer for clarification, by the way the comment
From wolf being like I don't want to watch any of the content from now on
It's like they had like a huge problem with that and i'm like anyone can say that
Anyone could anyone could just go. Yeah, I don't want to watch this person. It's like yeah, that's fine
Yeah, same time for people said i've seen one of ranks's video or i've seen one of maller's video
And I never never would have seen any of your their videos ever again
Yeah, and the response is just okay
Before you got here rags somebody was like it's hard for me to admit but I used to actually watch rags content
It's hard to admit
I know I can't admit it in front of my new friends who definitely wouldn't judge me over that sort of thing
And yeah, and as for the like the android comment
So she was overexposed because of the lighted it made her look super pale like unrealistically like smooth and pale
She kind of looks like how androids are often portrayed. I believe I said this in the video
It's like it's not supposed to be going. She's ugly. It's just like wow your lighting kind of fucks you up
That's that's mainly what the point was and then um the comment about how the way the way it's framed in that tweet is uh
Some androids looking nice the point
Uh, I think it was wolf was saying it to rags or vice versa
That there are androids in movies depending on which one you're looking at where they like
Look one-to-one like real people. So saying she looks like an android doesn't make sense in that regard
But we meant the ones that don't yeah that yes
What we what we really meant was that she looks visually indistinguishable from a human. Yes, that was our comment
In fact, we we probably might end up making that comment a lot
I just like you know with context for all them just like it's not really that harsh like as insults go
And really like the comment was more along the lines of like what her lighting was and how overexposed it was to make her skin
like just look plastic and
Yeah, just not skin
It was just mostly a lighting comment if I recall
It was just unnatural for her like the production value that she usually has and everything
And size of her channel all that it was strange and that was all your comment was
But like the the channel's been around for a while. So it's like to have lighting that like atrocious
It's like come on. Really?
She looked odd
She had she had she had an odd looking face
I suppose it's good that
They highlighted how much of a horrible comment that was so it gets us to essentially
Re-explore how bad her lighting is over and over again. It's like if you want us to do that
We will it could have been a passing thing
But no it has to be like the focus of it now
And yeah, and then I guess the point that he's trying to make is that even if there is an insult like say for example
Two plus two is actually four you idiot. You don't then go idiot. I'm out
Like oh, I mean you don't have you can you know, everybody has to consent to the conversations they're having
I'm not saying that's not the case, but
Yeah, this thing got blown out of proportion and they were desperately searching for idiot all insults we had in the um
in the coverage of it, but yeah
uh
Thanks to that guy for making the cut
so if you guys actually want to watch the cut up version you can find it in the description of this video and um
he
Concluded like I said, there's just over three hours
Not quite 11 or 12, but you know
I can't wait for the for the
People from huffing and post tweeting out. I can't believe this guy spent days
Cutting out 11 hours of content about making fun of a woman. How dare he?
I'll be the next thing
Um, and yeah, so as a as a finale, this is a meme that got made
about the whole thing
jabs for jeb
she's jenny nelson made a made a joker video and a lot of people wanted us to cover it because
The between the three of us we i'll say we enjoyed
Great I really liked it. That's right. Yeah, that's some that's some of that good stuff that joker. We're gonna check this out
Uh with all of you along with us. It's gonna be fun
Check out what argument she has and how she felt the video is called
Why I didn't like the joker, which is fine. I want to get that out there, you know
Find not like it. It's what comes after that is usually the um, yeah, it's the why is she made out of plastic?
um
Oh my god, okay, it's happening
That is like way too many hours this what being an alpha loser looks like
This actually is a master class on being a dedicated imbecile. Holy shit. I can't stand small snippets
How do you survive like this? Imagine being one of these men having a fursona with that
Woman for her personal appearance and interest why did I
Rip jenny's comments forever except they were never good cuz she's a woman online with opinions
Our five sexist rant part 10 or 10 i'm still right. She's wrong hour 11
What the fuck is an opinion? Just my guess of the structure you three are the definition of basement dwelling in cells
You have girlfriends you have your own apartment slash houses 12 fucking hours
Not a single goddamn person will sit through this anyone who says they have is a filthy liar
Six hour takedown of the last jedi when your angry response to a thing is longer than the thing itself
You can't be a very skilled writer. Oh my god. I can't trust an idiot
He's also very
Stupid
within an hour of irrelevant stuff before getting to your video
Then begin by saying assist white boy nerds do because you like the new star wars
Well, maybe if you actually at least try to watch the video
You would find out that the actual response is only about two hours long since they don't just talk about your video
I know it may sound wrong, but they genuinely give you good criticism on your really bad points
This is you
I regret this. I skim through it out of morbid curiosity
They like to play three seconds clips of your video with no context then argue against said grip with strong
Attacks for 15 minutes. What a bizarre way to attempt criticism
The sad thing is his fanboys have created a dumb meme
I am still amazed each day at the length shitty youtube man will go to harass others
I know this is nothing new, but my god, it hasn't gotten any better
He recoils in terror figuratively from having a coach of thesis and demonstrating it with focus
It is contempt for his audience by not actually making a premise and just reading a grocery list of things
He doesn't like what the actual fuck did you just say to me right now?
I really really want you to acknowledge what random obsessive men see as objective folks in your subjective tasting films
Please go on a show with dudes who call people retarded. This is not at all a trap
If you're feeling suicidal and you come to the right place
Oh that explains it you are a literal nazi
Now holy fuck are you being an idiot intentionally ever get so mad at women you go alive for 12 hours
They do what they normally do but to a woman. They are sexist. Fuck it. I'm leaving with I don't know if and when i'll come back
Oh, that was great
Oh my god
Um
I get it
Yeah, go ahead check this video it's called long bad bad jab dickels edition, uh
Excellent shit
No, that's the first video you edited. That was amazing. That was really good
I can still I can still hear jay's voice in the wind
He wants this already
Uh shame he's gone forever. Yeah, that's the first video you've edited man
Yeah, man, that was uh, very very good. I love it as a um,
If someone was unaware of what happened all over twitter just like just watch that
And I love the guy who's like they've constructed a meme where they
They prevent any criticism. It's like you guys made the meme for us like
He's he's like they played us like
Guys don't say it's long that's what they want. It's long man. They're aware that's stupid
Um, oh man twitter is a shit hole it is
an absolute
Just it's just a dumpster full of the worst of humanity
Oh my goodness
The the the computer voice is just the best. Yeah, do they even have any apartment slash houses?
I didn't know that it was so easy to tell whether or not somebody could have sex or not. Yeah, just like that
It's whether or not they like the last jedi if they like the last jedi they're slaying mad poon
Apparently
Um
Which yeah, it's like we can't really follow that up
Now we're going to be moving into something that rags and jay are aware of but we have to share with the efap audience. This is um
So we covered him a long time ago. Mr. No bullshit. They remember. Oh, yeah
Ms. Will explain your history a little bit with him jay nice and vague so we can slip people into this
when I was um
When when I was like starting out like mostly my first year I made a few videos covering his old channel
Which is called brooks show, which is terrible. I just covers media his new terror his new channel is terrible, too
but uh
His his old channel is like I mean they're both really something
I covered him a lot and I was like wow, this guy's actually a piece of shit
I'm like, I don't really want to link to his videos. Uh when I cover him
Uh, so I I made a video announcing why I wasn't gonna link to his videos anymore
And I think is that is that the necessary context?
Yes, uh, we've got you know, we'll play what he says and then we can play. Um
What you actually said because i've got the time stamps for that as well
so we can do that if you want just because
I think people will find it pretty amusing but the let's let's listen first. So this is a psa sitch friend of efap
Decided to have no bullshit on his show to discuss claims that no bullshit was racist and um
Let's say during that
Some other topic comes up, uh strangely so i'm just gonna let this play talking about because you've already
He said he wants to
Much different is much different than like a possible mixed percentage
But the whole point is I don't care about that shit
Like I don't talk about like white ethno nothing like you're the one bringing that shit up
And then that's why i'm asking why did you go on the screen?
You trick me into talking about it and then now all of a sudden you're like saying oh now he's one of them
It's like fuck you dude. You're just making shit up
So why did you go on the stream with terry mccarthy if this isn't your concern?
What why why not? Why do you say why do you say I can and can't stream with certain people?
I'm not saying you can't why is that a crime?
Whoa, where did I say you can't i'm asking you why you did?
I'm not saying you can't do it. You say it like it was a crime committed
So i'm saying like like in my opinion explain to me the context you've yet to do
I could say the same thing about you. Like for example, i've seen some of your other streams. Why did you stream with mauler?
The silence is like my favorite thing ever because like wait
What?
Because I like his content. What does that have to do with anything?
Well, i'm just saying I mean he's a known leftist and he has some pretty shady people on this show
Wait, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You said mauler is a known leftist
Mauler is like totally anti-estudate. His co-host is rags. What are you talking about?
rags is a leftist
What are you talking about? How is rags and mauler leftists? They're liberals. They're liberals. Okay. So, you know what liberals and
It's like I learned a new word today
So like before because there's a bit more to this but before I could see I was just like we did it
I was talking to jay about this. We need one more now. We've got um
Remarkable republican and no bullshit have both called it. There's a leftist podcast if we can get one more
That's a complete pattern of both being called super lefty and super right
So uh, then we'll have them all on at the same time
They can argue over what we actually are
Remarkable republican and we'll have knobs and we'll have
I don't know the zombie of ronald reagan. They'll all be on the podcast
And we'll go over why we're all
leftists
But like yeah
for reference
Go ahead
You know, you go you go about a week and a half two weeks of being called red pill end cell
um
Yeah misogynist racist
Nerds, right and then sure enough here comes knobs from left field. No, no, no, no. They're leftists
It was kind of a nice change of pace. I know. Yeah, it was refreshing to say the opposite of
Well, I'm like the opposite of stupid because they're both stupid but
Man, he's always there to brighten up your day with some incredibly stupid comment, but I like that
I don't know. Yeah, I I don't I don't have any issues with him directly. I've never had any issues
He's been supportive of my channel. I've I've never had any issues with him per se
But if you're leftist what the fuck do you have alt right jeremy on your?
stream
I thought that that was the narrative that we were hard right, you know, like
I guess I don't understand what the hell he's talking about
Why would you have the trump supporting jeremy from geeks and gamers on your channel? Uh consistently and it makes no sense
Yeah, he said we had some shady people on but like we we looked at our list
from
Knobs's perspective what he who would he consider like a shady person to have on?
And I don't know what if we found anybody it's me it's me i'm the shady one. I I guess it is jay
Well, no, it's definitely jay
but notice whenever
No, no, whenever whenever anyone like says like oh efap is this political thing. It's always to demonize it
It's never like oh, I like efap because it represents my politics, right?
It's like apolitical. Well because nobody's gonna like it for that. That's not really what like why people
People totally like stuff. No, sorry. What I mean is nobody's gonna like it because it's all right or because it's leftist
Or because it's left or right or blah blah blah
It's you know, like if we win. Yeah, that's what i'm getting at
Who hate the mandalorian because it's not political enough
a joke
Yeah, I mean if it isn't political or if it's the wrong political then they just won't they won't like it's bad
It's a bad thing. The themes were bad. So I can't it can't watch it. It's bad
Is there any have you guys had any issues? I mean, what's the what what is the history with no bullshitting you guys?
Well, we covered we covered it infinity war video and holy fuck dude
Like that's one of my favorite highlights of all of efap
We basically he's trying to explain how there's loads of woke elements to infinity war
One of them includes the fact the vision is kind of like a human kind of like a robot
So he's obviously trans he's like the trans character
And it's like the trans
Yeah
Visions trans they're trying to put in their trans propaganda
Wait, I want to so wait. Wait, because they've not heard it before actually got a daily, right?
So, you know how?
You have a lot of characters in the film a lot of just just characters in general and they're they're of different
You know, like some are male some are female you could say that right?
Yeah, that's a pretty it's pretty easy thing to agree with. Uh, no bullshit's commentary was uh, there is a suspicious amount of women
Uh
I just hadn't heard that one before, you know
It's good to know that in the mind of knobs if he was making a movie review one of his points would be
There's a suspicious amount of women i'm curious
Like an ironic comment that there's there's I don't know. I ain't saying it's wrong
It's just really suspicious how many women
It's not about the content it's not about what actually happens or whether it you know, it's good for film
It's just about the gender of the cast. That's what matters, right?
I'm curious like what the number is for him like you can have this many women. Okay. Oh, oh, wait
Wait, peter dinklage eat if you forgot you got oh, I did tell him about this earlier
But yeah, the top comment the top quote was the um, he described having a large midget as being something of an sjw thing to do
I
Complain about sjw nonsense constantly, but i've said this before if everything is sjw then nothing is sjw
Yeah, and so we've been criticized as the geese and gamers for not
going after the
Gay scene in it chapter two because apparently people were like that's woke that's sjw. No, no, it's not
What the fuck are you talking about? I'm a I'm a gay in the book
Yes
Yes
Yeah, so people were criticized for bending the need sjw used it's like oh my god
You really think geeks and gamers does that also when we were doing the gameplay for jedi fallen order?
There's a black female in it and somebody says here comes the sjw park and of course this part comes in
What's the sjw part? Like see black woman like
The game's dull and boring enough without having to make stuff up so you don't need to do that
Oh, yeah, the black woman equals sjw then uh, well she's the
She's the chick from the wolfenstein movie they made a few years ago
Yeah, yeah, so that's why I saw her and i'm like, oh not you
It wasn't because she was black is because she was a fucking annoying stupid character in the wolfenstein movie
See now you can see with when you know, no bullshit. I mean he sees a woman he knows it's woke
That's why he thinks that you guys are just about as far left as fucking possible
Because he doesn't understand how you can watch this and not be offended by the wokeness
Well, and that's the thing we're just sitting here like oh, what are we today general public? Okay
Thank you chat. That's why her eyes do scare me. Yes, like her eyes are
Unnaturally large and they are legitimately
Uh strange to look at
She can she's she's she's actually he's not she doesn't play a human in fallen order
She's actually a a bipedal humanoid race, but their eyes are shaped so that they can see behind them
They're like a donkey, you know where they could see all around them kind of at once
you know
Um, you can't sneak up on them
A predator prey thing prey has the eyes on the side of their head and predators have them on the front of their head
As long as you don't say she looks like an android, I think we're good
Yeah
I was actually gonna say I can I can pull it up
Um as a sort of it's just it was funny
So let's see if I can do this because to remind the audience of no bullshit's uh
Commentry. Oh, see we're already laughing at it. Stop stop. Uh
According to my notes. It was two three seven fifteen. All right
This is a blast from the past people
The point is they chose the most well-known film for that joke exactly
It's not obviously it was like. Oh, yeah, everyone's seen that
Then movie knowledge they're not fucking pushing the sjw agenda. Oh, yeah, was this when he said that?
Uh, the movie was sjw because they mentioned the film aliens and that's the film led by a woman
Oh, was that one of the arguments? That was one of the arguments
He's amazing that saying the world through a lens thing
Yeah
Yeah, his lens is bender's movie a week ago saying it was too male
No less and it looks like marvel has recognized that too. That's why they're over correcting now. There's also a giant midget in the movie
Oh
You know
Yeah, see I undersold it it's the way that he delivers it in a list format like
We always we all understand that giant midget actually they'll be moving on
Oh man, he elaborates on it too
Yeah, he does what does he say? Do you remember what he says because I don't know how long we talk about that
it's stuff like oh
um, we we all know how much sjw's love to have representation like disabled people are totally a
A group that they weren't represented and like slick stuff like that
I was like, that's probably why he's here. Well
And this was the funny thing that um endgame has that
all-wammon scene
and um
He like his take of endgame was pretty positive like we watched a bit of his video
He was like, yeah endgame was great and it was like you fucking ripped into infinity war
But like the most bizarre things that I don't know his
His his takes on exactly where the the sjw's are are very interesting sometimes. That's um
for instance
If you'll call out that all-wammon scene in endgame, then you're just
I saw several women calling it out and funnily enough. I think I told
Some of you guys a comment if I said on efap
But my sister said that that was the most frustrating part of the film for it. She thought it was so awkward
I was just like, well you're supposed to like it. So
You're a woman you will like women on big screen you're doing it wrong like shot her face into the screen clap
And
It's not to say there aren't things to you know
Maybe take a look at in infinity war when you look at the way that surrey treats. Uh,
Bruce banner and stuff like that, but
Fucking tall midgets. I I don't think that's I don't think that's a wolf problem
I've never heard that one ever that is fantastic. That's what caught us off guard so much
Um, but yeah, i'll just I think there was a little bit more of this i'll just play the rest make sure
Why did you stream with mauler?
There is a little bit because I like his content. What does that have to do with anything?
Well, i'm just saying I mean he's a known leftist and he so I didn't realize when I saw this
He was on the stream where you covered him
Oh, yeah, yeah, sitch was sitch was on the stream we covered him. Yeah, that's great. I love that. I love that
Dude, that's why I believe that's why he actually has a problem with sitch
But he's just trying to connect this weird puzzle together to be like instead of the fact that you laughed at my retarded
Takeout a fucking movie. It's instead you're an asshole
Because you connected to mauler who's connected. Well, i'll let him finish. He has a line of logic here guys. Get ready
Are you familiar with j xc
I don't know what that means
It's a youtuber who was also streamed with mauler
No, I don't know who that is
So he also streamed with mauler and he had an interesting video about me that he privated
Because of embarrassment served the right to speak and some of my views are so controversial. I shouldn't have a platform
He got a lot of bad feedback about that and I just thought since you associated with him and his friends
Do you believe in freedom of speech? Yes, that's his line of logic. So
First of all that video wasn't private
Second of all, I don't think it got any bad feedback for it
Except maybe like the odd cover which like or you always get you know, it was overwhelmingly positive
at brooks
And
Should we get it? Have you got the I do? Yeah, we can we so we can play what knobs is
discussing right now
So this is where I said that he's not allowed to have a pit like where he should be removed from the platform
Should be removed from the platform say his shouldn't be free to speak
All right. Let me just get the timestamp
Considered to be harmful now
I would like to make it very clear that I do think he should be allowed to say these things
I don't want to take away his freedom of speech or prevent him from having the right
To express his beliefs or even hold these beliefs. I think that he should be allowed to do all of that
I will defend his freedom of speech as I hope he would defend mine and turn
However, I don't think the things he does or says are acceptable
I've decided to completely stop linking to any of his channels in any of my videos while I usually link to the
So like yeah
Sounds a little bit different to me
Oh, this is a two-minute video bear in mind
Well, I mean I would love for brooks to to uh talk to me about uh
If he's got a problem with me streaming with mauler because he's expressed interest in wanting to talk to me before in the past and
Complimented my channel. So
If if streaming with longman bad is bad. I would love for him to uh, talk to me about that
I'd love I'd love to hear also see with mauler into the far leftist
His issue honestly seems to be with uh with jay specifically like and he's drawn that the fact that i'm friends with jay
Means i'm bad and if you're friends with me, it means you're bad. It's just like whoa
This is guilt by association
To the second degree
Like you were on the podcast of someone who knows somebody else that I have a problem with
And why I have a problem with him in my description. He literally said the exact opposite thing
I
I was surprised that he's freedom of speech wanted to comment on the fact that it's like it opens with a beard like
He should be allowed to be on here. It's like oh
Like you're literally
If you're just gonna tell a blatant lie about someone what why have the middleman just say that
Sitch is the one lying don't say sitch knows a guy who knows a guy who said a lie
Why why even go that far? I mean just go for it. Just cut out the middleman
Um, yeah seems like a lot of bullshit to me
This um and then just to show off how fucking great no bullshit is uh because I listen to this video because I
I'm fascinated by no bullshit. Um
So just check out check out this portion
Right here
And there was a good comment in the chat
Uh brooks isn't a debater and that's what i've always said. I've never said I was a debater
I don't do debates. I don't even do very many live streams on my channel
I just do this for fun. And yeah, if i'm a bad debater, so be it. I don't give a shit debates are gay
And
Debates are the big gay btfo
Fuck down gay boy
What what do you do with that
I was trying to have a debate and the next thing I know was being rammed in the ass like what can I say?
It happened. I did it
We need someone is I hope someone does a meme where it's just just knobs his face and the little quote thing on the like
the black
Before this you'll have like an abraham lincoln quote and then a gandhi quote and then knobs debates
I love just reading the chat as you know, because I have the chat up on screen going by one just says knobs huffs paint
I think he's huffing more than that. Like this is something else going on
Oh, he is legitimately the worst debater that i've ever seen in my life. Well good rags because debates are gay and he's he's an alpha
I want to seem to debate major lee
Oh god, it's gonna be like a black hole
Future lee came and talked to you guys, right? He did. Yeah
That's one of the women a suspicious amount of women
He didn't respond to the request to come on the common ground stream. Oh ryan. So he didn't respond really
Yeah, no a bunch of people tagged him. So
You think maybe one debate was enough you'd think that would be the like he
With how I understand major lee. I would have thought he'd love to do that. He seems to love doing that kind of thing
I'm so disappointed. I would have watched the show out of that
Well, there will be another because there's there's no uh shortage of people that really want to talk to jeremy
Uh, it seems like who uh half of them end up backing out
Is this how it comes because debates are gay. So that's why
Yeah
Nailed it. I'm pretty sure there's another one of these in this video as well. I've got I think he says twitter is gay
Let's have a look. Oh my god. I want to debate him on the idea that debates are gay
That's like a
Gay debate inception right is with you with rephrasing questions like you just said jokes have truth in them
Yeah, so when you say a joke that's kind of racist. What is the truth in that joke?
I don't I didn't say a joke that's kind of racist. This is what i'm saying
Did he just say he's never said a joke that's kind of racist. Oh, fuck it
It wasn't even the point of this clip if you want to watch this nightmare stream
Was that the quote was that the quote if you want to watch this nightmare stream?
There's a shit ton of terrible quotes that come out of his mouth. Go for it
I need to write down that timestamp. This debate is playing next to every joke
He's ever made where he's like, you know what fucking?
Jews like that's
Just the jokes he tells well, I mean there was a point in the stream where sorry where knobs
completely straight faced
Right off right out right out of his mouth ass. Sitch, which one are you first jewish or white?
And i'm like holy fuck maul and I were watching it and i'm like
Jesus christ my jaw hit the floor
Like I could ever even imagine asking I like if I can't imagine asking freeny
He's like, which one are you first black or australian?
like
I do have that question
Wouldn't even occur to me. He actually he asked it so nonchalantly
Yeah, yeah, he he's like he phrases it like it's like that's a very normal question to ask and it's like oh
Oh
Just try to make a pin on them and you're telling people they say shit you're doing that fucking reporter lady bit that interview
Peterson the chat is the chat is like
All over the place man. It's like oh have I gone past it someone in chat said twitter is gay
That's what I was actually going for. Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry
I gotta I gotta hear him say twitter is gay
There's another one that says twitter is also jewish by the way
Okay, who cares about tweets twitter is gay dude
There it is
I agree twitter is this the big gay twitter is
Suspicious amount of gay
All of the gay, uh, and then i've got
um, this one's a little longer, but it's him like flipping the fuck out because
I think if this doesn't include the context, right?
So what what's happening is that I think psa said she's asking no bullshit. Um
How can we didn't speak up in a stream where someone was saying that like interracial marriage is not okay
Interracial relationships aren't okay when he's got an asian wife because you'd think that would be the kind of thing
He would be like hey, you know, that's fucked up. Um, wait, is she 3d?
I've heard
Can't confirm. Um, but yeah, let's just check this out because he loses his shit mine and the creativity. Okay, so
Do you think right?
Your conversation was racist like if you're uh, I don't know who that is
The guy you had the conversation with ontario's stream who said that miscegenation should be illegal
That sounds pretty crazy
If you agree that that should you agree that being anti-miscegenation is racist, right you agree to that
I've agreed with you the whole day, dude. I'm not racist like get over it
Well, no, but you agree that anti-miscegenation laws are racist
What is that?
anti interracial marriage laws
Yeah, of course. I mean people can marry whoever they want. Okay people can live wherever they want
Like I i'm not racist like that's why didn't you call him out on the stream when he was insulting your wife and your relationship?
Dude, fuck you
Wow
He has a little wheel he spins in his head and it landed on angry and indignant
So he had to take that position regardless of the situation. He was actually him
Like he gets up in the morning and he walks upstairs and his mom's like oh, oh brooks
You look so nice today. He's like, fuck you mom. I don't have to take your shit
He talks like I talked when I was 14, I think
I don't like I'm like god. That's
The way he interprets everything modern warfare 2 except we stayed there and we never left
Yeah
But this is the thing like if you were to pause it right I go why are you offended what are you offended by?
But look how he like loses shit
Hey, he wasn't fucking insulting my wife. Like get out of here
He said he thinks that all interracial relationships should be illegal and that children of interracial relationships should be kicked out of the country
He's telling you whatever. I don't give a fuck what he said
You need to stop talking about my fucking wife
Asking him why he didn't defend his wife. Yeah the irony behind all of this
Like somebody coming up to you and saying hey this dude, I know this dude
I know called your mother a whore. He's like you stop fucking talking about my mom
They're like wait, why didn't you get mad at that guy who actually said it
Literally just hear the word wife. I think so. Yeah, he went he went into husband mode. I guess I don't know
I I feel like he was just kind of trying to get some outrage going to shut the conversation down as quick as he could
It's definitely a pivot. That's what he does all the time. That's what he does all the time
like
Out of your mouth that i'm offending you now and that the guy who doesn't want you to be legally married your wife doesn't offend
This is very strange
Like this fight is well that guy actually if you want to if you want to get down to it
I don't agree with what he has to say, but he was nice and had a cordial conversation with me unlike you
Oh, he's so classic
You didn't speak up about you imagine saying this shit like imagine saying oh he was fucking nice to me
Fucking loser like
As if as if like guys to me what he said my wife was really
Putting that much value on being civil while we're like yay fucking loser
At least he nicely told me that I shouldn't be married to my wife and our potential kids should be kicked out of the country
Is there a nice way to say that
I suppose evidently I went over pretty well with him
Oh shit, why don't you tell me sit sit sit fuck you?
You're a bitch sit. Do you have a shit channel and this isn't gonna get you any fucking attention?
You're not the next destiny. Let's hey, oh, it's not gonna get him any attention. Oh my god
Oh, I love this
So much it is knobs is he's legitimately a pain to listen to because he's he actually is that stupid
He can't grasp the most basic concepts
Um, it is equal parts
Frustrating and entertaining to listen to just about insanely stupid. He is childish outbursts
He better was like a comic relief character in a cartoon
Like he's he's a one-off episode he's a one-off character in an episode of rick and morty who rick kills
Oh, he would be the antagonist probably but he wouldn't be aware of it or gay
You know what? He kind of reminds me like he'd be like a bit pot like gearhead. Oh
It kind of you know, it kind of reminds me of that guy at the lighthouse during the purge episode of rick and morty
He's got the script going and he's like I want you to go ahead and tell me what you think of the script
Don't worry. I can take it. Don't be gay. Well, I
And then morty's like, okay
Well, maybe you shouldn't start your stories in the middle and maybe go at the beginning get out get the fuck out
I told you not to get the fuck out. Just get out the middle is gay
Um, it's too much middle, but yeah, that's it for the for that
Saga, I just I just like to think that no bullshit doesn't like us
And I imagine it's because we covered a tismy video also we're friends with jay. We didn't agree with him
Um, we thought we thought what he said was stupid and therefore we're super left
Dare I say no bullshit is welcome to come on if he wishes to I don't think he will want to so it's you know
It'll be fine
Not after today. No
Look no bullshit if you're listening to this all we did was play your quotes, dude
We didn't do anything else
I would love for him to ask me about my far left friends mauler and rag. Yeah
Love for that question to pop up
I was just asked by scrump if debates are gay earth and traps
That's an interesting question
Um, I do not know was that traps weren't gay. I want to draw attention to a cool and then kind of I guess
Sad thing so we got efap is on imdb, which is cool
But um, it's got a 3.7 out of 10
uh from 50 reviews
apparently judging from uh
Where is it the review link? There we go
You're the first review which is apparently the most useful review there right now is efap is a good name since it's literally a circle jig
It will probably take a few years to watch the first five episodes if you have no life and also no taste
Efap is definitely the podcast for you
Chances are this review will have a 59 hour response from mauler and the other guys since he is incapable of debating himself
As evidenced by his interactions with jack saint but debating by himself. Sorry simply put it's mauler
What do you expect?
Nine people found that useful. All right
Um, but yeah, uh, this is ignoring that well, I was gonna say that there are some positive reviews as well
Uh, we got we even got a long man bad. Um
In quotation marks, that's how you know that they're fans. Uh, yep
But yeah, they it's still sputtering up this this is uh, there's getting everything in order and we've even got like a narrative going
so you got um
Like episode one three old friends gather on a new platform
And cover the already infamous gerry genesis and the law behind his inner sanctum
They also cover downward thrust a man who speaks many words, but with a little meaning
Like it goes through like when we get to like the the tro bit
It's like uh, the mastermind behind it all is finally revealed the progenitor of patrick is here with uh,
With his assistance of the dreaded quinton all fire. He's firing all cylinders wolf is injured in this devastating assault
That uh wolf down for the count the defeat this it's a whole narrative. There are seasons. It makes total sense
Go and check it out. Uh, give it a negative review if you feel efap sucks
Give it a positive one if you think it's good and engaged this person obviously
uh put some effort into making this so
Uh, it's cool stuff and who knows maybe it'll get fleshed out and you'll have a full-on guide to efap the internet
TV show as i'm sure it can be considered
Internet tv show we did it. We did it. Yeah, we did it
This is what we wanted all along this to be called the internet tv show
And I think it worked out so well for everyone trying to do this in the past
We figured we'd throw our hat into the ring. I guess uh, I just looked geeks and gamers has one and we have a lower rating than you
guys
We have a 2.9 out of 10 bullshit
Everyone go immediately to the efap imdb give us one star
Yeah, we got to get lower the geeks and gamers
Yeah, it's a race to the zero
Um, I will pop this in the description so people can check it out
Which by the way in the description as well is the the subreddit and the efap.me website
There's a lot of like fan-made things in relation to other things to keep track of now
So i'm sorry if it gets all
Chunky in the description, but all of the relevant links will be found in there. It's um, chunky is gay. Yeah
See, but yeah, dude, I don't I don't see any positive reviews
If you scroll all the way down there's one guy that says jeremy sjw slayer
He's a bright light of hope and change of something on youtube in this rust era of our generation
Uh 205 found that helpful. Oh, well
You must have done something to get you up to a 2.9
I'm gonna make a video on this. Oh, I love it. Thank you for whoever created that and thank you mauler for
I was like, you know, just keep some gamers have one. I feel like somebody told me we did pretty proud of that 2.9
Oh, you know what?
You've just made me realize I should probably look into it a little bit more for the details
And you could probably do the same because on so i'm just gonna look through this again. This is
Uh what I mean, but like cast and crew
We got um, I guess
Wait, oh, so these are all the people who are in it molar is executive producer jax's manager makes sense
I'm just trying to see if uh, the producer credits. Why is this linked to it?
Like all the cast it's just everyone castes himself. Yeah
Country uk or a documentary i'm curious if james maul would be cited as a
producer
And then that review is just there that's a that's a thing. What do the other reviews say? I probably should have looked at uh reviews
Um
Uh, the memes are the best my favorite episode is episode 21 with weekend warrior watch efap
There's no way to explain the absolute quality of this podcast series to someone who hasn't heard of it
See no wonder they got upset seeing these reviews. They were like, oh, we can't have this
Oh look, there's a review for this episode up there already
Oh my goodness
Wow review made on a live stream plot twist at the end
Oh, that's great. Oh that the the sickle jig review is going down now
Well, yeah, you're just uh, yeah, like I said, it's in the description, uh, it's cool as a little like thing
And um, no, it can't be going down there because apparently your vote will be counted and appear on this page within 24 out
Well, I guess now is within 20
Yeah
Never mind that is within 24 hours
Time is gay. Yeah time is gay the big gay
Um, I was I was also made aware by the way on um two different episodes. I haven't got the specifics for them unfortunately, but um
apparently smud boy says like a year ago
That uh the way they're going with disney star wars is that they're starting to just ignore all of the things they have in terms of like
Uh the world like like what tools and abilities they have and instead
They just do things because they look cool without thinking about it. And one of the things he says is we're probably going to see them riding horses
Um, instead of using any kind of vehicle at some point and it's like oh shit
And we joke about it's in the doomcock episode the first one I think episode honestly
It's the it's literally the most popular episode we got because we cover major lee's
Um, quote unquote video. Oh, yeah. Yeah
Uh in that we all joke at one point that ray is palpatine's granddaughter
Oh really? Um, I haven't got a link for that either yet, but yeah, I just thought that was
We did it oof
You know when we when we make a joke disney, you're not supposed to
Supposed to do it for serious. That's how they're doing it. They're uh,
They're like just looking up
Uh, he's watching efap they're looking for like people joking about what will happen next and they're using that as the writing room
That's all the abrams can really do is just repurpose other's ideas. So now he's gone to search in the internet for it. So that's
That's what we've got. I think it was um, I could be wrong on this but the the writer for westworld
Uh said the someone had guessed the ending
In in like a reddit thread and so he wanted to change it from seeing that
It's like this i'm pretty sure that's actually like a real thing for writers. They're just like no
They know that ray is the granddaughter. No can't have that it's all wrong
um
So yeah, we're finally there the uh, we we are now poised to read these leaks
Let's do it excited looking at them. This is so this is the I guess it comes in three portions. It's the um
And it's all been updated and expanded how the fuck did did they just leak the script at this point?
You said three you said three portions and I couldn't help but think about knobs again. I don't know why wait. What?
Because you know, he's not
He's a larger man. He's not
He specifically has
He's uh, he squirreled out of that question with destiny. So who knows?
The portions question you just yeah, all I've got is what jiggy is
Well, but there's like videos of him like he can't get out of that. I know I know he's clearly a bigman
Does he identify as a bigman? I haven't you know, I didn't know identifying is gay
I've never been on a scale that's gay
So, uh, just to clarify right so, uh, jeremy ryan you both have read through this at some point. Yeah
Fortunately, unfortunately
So this is new for me rags. I believe that's bullshit and jay. Yep
Um, oh wait, I posted you guys twice. Okay, as long as you follow along
So which one do we do you want us? Do you want to use the first one?
Do you want to should we take turns in reading or do you want to do it rags?
I knew you like reading. What's what's uh, what should we do?
Like a take turns. I like taking turns gay
Free is gay sort of debate totally women. I could actually hear him like in this voice saying reading is gay
Just ask me if I want to read. Fuck you
Fuck you. Take that reading out of your mouth right now. What is this? I'm kind of a trial a test
Gonna be a suspicious amount of reading that you're like, you can read syllables in some of these words
You can't read right bro, because he's like fuck you
Oh
I was just asking you a question. Of course I can read a b c d e f g c
That's not the order they go in
lies
you
a b c d e f g
mostly
Um, so I mean yeah, I can I can go first if you guys want this should be uh
Interesting act one
two minutes
game of thrones leaks
Yeah, the was the funny thing was that the game of thrones leaks were like bullet points and there was like seven
And they were very simple. This is like somebody this is detail
Yeah, I was gonna say somebody's learned a lot about this. I guess so
Yeah act one the past unknown location. So I guess we're starting with a flashback then
Uh luke is training leah as a jedi lightsabers are involved
Leia reveals to luke that she is pregnant and leah makes the decision to end her jedi training
due to the impending birth of her son
All right, uh, I could have slowly already that ryan said that uh, she didn't get any training
Um at some point
JJ's like oh, yeah, you destroyed my guy's mask. Well, fuck you
It was it was either that was jj or ryan
But yeah, it doesn't matter I guess because uh, go behind your back and make the things you wrote make sense you cuck
When i've been making this for your themes
Yeah, because like it feels like a rap battle between jj and ryan
Where like one of them drops a movie the others like oh, no, here's my rebuttal and then jj's like ooh collin
Travaro got fired i'm coming back and i'm going to i'm gonna drop another first on ryan
I mean, this is a fucking disaster. None of this shit makes sense. None of it ties together
It's a cool thing contest between two stupid
little men
So and so one of the things that makes me like wonder when I first saw these leaks is we were told over and over again
That they were going to be using repurposed scenes from force awakens and tlj that didn't get out there
They weren't going to do any recreation for kerry fissure
So does that that has to mean that this scene was already filmed at some point?
either that
Either that bullshit and every line she delivers is facing like luke if you know what I mean
And uh, and they're all like a voice that doesn't quite sound like it because i'm assuming they didn't entirely use only lines
She'd already recorded. They must get like an impressionist or something
No, no, they're gonna they're gonna uh, they're gonna cut. Um, like there's gonna be a loud noise as layer speaking
And then luke goes what's that? You're saying layer you're pregnant
You lay it just speaks in barks
Layers layers typing a message to us lairs typing the message there. Look we're fucking a well. We do it over emison
Lawl i is preggers yo
What
It's all really awkwardly chopped up footage
So it's like layer saying I and that it cuts to like her saying am in a completely different location
I am with a son and there's a break it and then none
All right, so then it goes to the present so that's going to be an awkward
Opening if it's literally just I have a son i'm not going to train with you anymore next scene
Oh
Because it feels yeah, this is strange. It's like this is odd placement for this scene feels like this probably should whatever
So the present the resistance jungle base years after layer has picked up where her brother left off and has been helping ray learn that
Yeah, all right, she got the books I guess picked up where her brother left off
On the second day
She picks up the book the book has like a one to 100 guide on how to be a jenna and she's like
How far did loop get then ray is just like you've opened the book. That's further than he got
Step one throw the lightsaber step two be a dick. That's as far as we got
I mean, yeah the trailer because again, this is already matching the trailer
She's definitely training with layer and it's just like why are you training? You're already
You're already the best at everything
Is this is this establishing that layer has been trained as a jedi so that ray can continue being trained by layer?
I guess even though it just said that layer didn't finish her training. I guess she's a half jedi
You can train ray to become a quarter jedi or something
Teach ray how to fly
Yeah, I mean she's gonna be like
These are the things you could do as a jedi like a huge list that they're all ticked for ray
And she's like have you got anything you can't do she's like can't fly yet. Like all right. Let's try it
All right. You remember that mountain you picked up earlier just tried that and he's like, oh, yeah, that's right. Yeah
Then
She's like, okay
Push away from earth and that will make you fly just like okay. Cool. She ends up pushing earth away from her like it's that powerful
Lay's like oh shit
Um, I wasn't scared then but I have now so when ray jumps she just pushes the planet down
Yeah
And then it returns to her
Everyone else like whoa
Like oh shit
But ray is first seen doing some med meditative mental force training, but it's struggling with it. I
Okay, that's how you don't these leaks aren't real that can't be true
Her lip twitched she's struggling
In frustration, she asks layer if she can do a physical training course instead
This is what we see ray doing in the jungle forest in the d23 first
Look, it appears that ray has more physical fortitude than she has mental strength. Uh,
Okay, I don't think that's true
Of course, so I don't pretty sure her mental strength is through the fucking roof
But yeah, I mean like at the very start when she started using it she beat kylo at it
With her mental strength over his and he trained. Yeah
Yeah, she was able to resist kylo's probes. She well and she used that moment
They later explained right in all the novelizations that they she used some force download method
That's explaining how like she she it makes sense. It makes yeah, she
They had to make it makes sense. So she downloaded all that she knows from that mental link
Uh, but evidently she's even more uh has even more prowess physically than mentally
Oh gosh, that's some lazy storytelling right there
Yeah, so then we moved to forest planet bathed in red light
So I remember that in the trailer as well supreme leader supreme leader kylo ran around forest run
So he's the supreme leader now, all right has been made aware of a dark power supreme leader in the last one by the end of it
right, but
Yes, but I just like it just
It doesn't change anything
It also sounds awkward. Yeah
Like what difference does it make he doesn't take orders from snow kyle ben wanted the exact same things
Anyway, uh kylo ren has been aware of a dark power behind his predecessor and former master snoke. Yeah, well
Yeah, okay because snoke himself wasn't that powerful really
He's a loser
Uh kylo's been spending his time as leader of the first order with the purpose of locating this power
Generals hux and pride have been following kylo around on his quest
And are beginning to get frustrated with what they see as a fool's errand
um
Fair enough. They see this as a waste of the first order's time and resources. Well
I'm curious what they think the first order should be doing i'm guessing
It'd be the first time they'd acknowledge the fact that the first order want to rule the galaxy. Yeah, I don't know
Yeah, they've never really acknowledged what their purpose is. We just want to be doing general nazi things
Yes, like can we kill some children or something gosh?
Yeah, we're just being evil in space
um, also, yeah pride is played by um
Fuck i've forgotten his name
Very very no very popular older british actor. Um, well matt smith not necessarily popular but awesome
But a lot of people pointed out. He is a white man named pride. I wonder if there's something going on there. I was just like, oh
When we catch up with the villains of our story kylo is leading an assault
On this planet with the purpose of finding darth vader's wayfinder device. What?
Wayfinder halo. That's what I just think of halo. I know it's way through a website, but I just think halo
It was it's just like it was a macguffin in the first one and jj's got it again
It's like it's a macguffin again, but it's darth vader's macguffin. You're like, oh
The thing that this character has it is about to a thing
Um the past let it die
Unless we need marketing the device reveals coordinates within the
Unknown regions and kylo is confident that this will reveal the source of snook's power
Okay, because it's not like because you gotta have a source of power. You can't like train or anything
You can't actually become skilled or knowledgeable. You can't, you know practice god forbid
And you're you are the power. No, you have to take it from somewhere else
Oh, yeah, you have to be plugged in to something else richard e garand. Uh, that is the name. I was thinking oh, yeah
Oh, he's he's good. What's he doing in this? Yeah, I know I know
I was about to say rohan atkins
Uh
Kylo Ren slaughtered his way through the natives and has eventually led to the oracle who gives him the way fine
Oh my goodness the oracle
We always need wood. Oh, it's got it's like please be a spider you can click on it
You can click on the oracle spider and then it leads us to
Oh, there's a chance right? There's like there was a chance that they like that they think
That it's going to be like some spidery alien
I hope I hope there's a spider in this place. Please be a spider in the scene of some kind
Go big or go home. The oracle is the spider
Fine. Yeah. Oh, no, wait, if there's a spider in the scene, like the oracle is a fraud
It's just listening to what the spider says
Uh, actually
Well, apparently next to the leak that if you click the oracle it brings up another thing
And one of the bullet points is when we pick up with kylo story in episode nine
He's still struggling between the light side and the dark side
like how at what fucking point I
What light side thing has he done?
Um, he thought about it before he fucking killed hon. I suppose
He didn't kill his mom, I guess that's about the only thing
Um, well he he failed to kill her as far as I know but he tried
So, I know you guys mentioned spiders, but uh, so evidently this takes place in a swamp and we scroll down that oracle thing
a trek
it says, uh
Let's see. I'm personally into it feels a bit of inspired by ralph mccquarrie kind of like a mix between the digger bus spiders
and the digger bus creature
Give us the spider give the spider
Um, I was gonna say who wants to do the next well three or so, I guess
Uh, i'll do it
sure
All right
So asteroid base we pick up with finn and po on the millennium falcon accompanied by a handful of unfamiliar alien characters
Traveling to an icy asteroid base to meet the first order
Informant the informant an alien is acting as a middleman between the first order and the mole and our heroes
Oh the first order mole which is supposed to is that going to turn out to be hux. That's what I've heard hux. Yes
What hux this is the thing hux might be the most inconsistent character already just from these leaks now
Uh-oh, it turns out all that your mom jokes really swayed him
Dude
I'm gonna do the psychopath thing and watch all of the films before watching the new one
Yes, the last jedi will be viewed again
And I know for a fact when they reveal that he's evil i'm gonna be like, okay
I got a few questions to ask about like a lot of these
I love the idea that his incompetence is now they're trying to explain it would be like he's a good guy
It's like but he seems very invested in killing these people. It's like nope. Nope. Nope. He's just about
It's just an act just an act and you fell for it. Ha ha ha see
Okay
Reach for his gun when snoke is unconscious kylo. And yeah
All right. Well, I mean that you can explain that by him being a yeah, I know I know you can
I know I mean that's the explanation ryan was probably going for but like I don't know the ryan was going for this
I don't know
No, no, no i'm saying that ryan was almost certainly going for hux just being selfish and wanting power. Yeah. Yeah
um, but like
Would it be inconsistent if he's a mole?
I I think that that's kind of the way that they are probably going to go about that they're going to do it
Whether it's jealousy or whether he wants to take it over from kylo
I think that's probably what they're going to go for. Um a character
Secretly being a traitor the whole time is the equivalent of at the end of the film they woke up and it was all a dream
Oh, yeah, it's it's well, not if it's well full of shadowed, which it isn't
Yeah
Because I was gonna say this this is such a fucking thing to be like aha all of your criticisms were wrong now
And it's like no they've just they're just different now like all of this
What is what is with that scene then where he's like?
What's the point of all this if we can't kill all of these people and he's like, sorry
We can't catch up to them. See it. It's just like oh, that's a that's a thing for a mole to do
And so it is it is a time jump so
This is just what I think it's gonna be stupid either fucking way
But what I think is that it's going to be like after a couple years, right hux and pride
Whatever this guy's name are pissed off that they're not doing anything
So maybe he's going to work with the resistance to uh, to try to get kylo taken out of power
Maybe that's his like end goal
Yeah, it's going to create issues no matter what but I think that that would make more sense than him having been a mole
The whole time that's going to be funny if they make that happen
This is like this is like the second best player
on a soccer team
secretly paying off
someone on the other team
To injure the star player so that he can be the best player on the field on his own team
What you said made more sense though because what he's going to be doing
They're going to destroy the team and like that in forward will be like yay now i'm the best on this team that's destroyed
I mean is that hux the one who blew up five planets
Yes
Yeah, which by the way, um
If he would I would have a problem with them letting him get away with that if he turned out to be someone who was like
Oh, i'll help now
Yeah, yeah
He got a tremendously long hill to climb my friend
but yes
so moving on
Kylo is struggling between the light and the dark
They've touched fingers once and that's a struggle my friend
That's kylo's story in every movie
Like do you remember when force awakens finished a lot of people were happily concluding. It's like yep. He's on the dark side for sure
And then the clj they're like, well, no, no, no, it's 50 50 and at the end of it
They're like, yep, he's on the dark side for sure
The third movie
No, no, no, no, no, he could do he's stuff
No, no shirt off in front of woman see struggle
God this this is going to end up being this trilogy is going to be
So going to be incredibly disjointed once it's all said and done
I mean it already is we know that but once we actually see this film
I think this is going to make the last shot eye even worse, which is amazing to say
Yeah, I think that's a guarantee you said said and done. Uh, I don't see it done
I mean, oh I guess well he said this trilogy so
Yeah, we'll see
Uh, you know trilogy is a loose term. You don't really know how many films are going to be in a trilogy
Well, yeah, do you guys know didn't jj originally intend to get two parts to this film?
At one point you mentioned. Yeah at one point because I remember reading about it
He he quoted saying you were those rumors the rumors were out there
But I don't want I don't think I don't think jj's ever specifically said anything about that
I I made a video a long time ago talking about the only way this movie could even be
Acceptable as if it was two parts
That's the thing. That's what I would ask for if I was given the reins. I'd be like, can I have two?
I might be able to fix it in two not one
I don't know if I can do this in one. Yeah
Yeah
Because there's no way you can fix the last jedi and complete this the story in one movie in one two hour two and a half
Hour movie. This is just going to be a disaster. And again, i'm still lobbying for creed to do the opening crawl
I want to hear creed seeing the open crawl
Why not rebecca fred rebecca friday rebecca black that's it she should do
because
First of all scott step needs to work and I want to see them use that wind machine where he's got his shirt unbuttoned
And it's blowing in the wind and he's just singing the opening crawl. That's my dream come true
I want to see this happen
Uh, and i'm not going to give up on hope I believe disney is stupid enough to do it
So i'm going to keep lobbying for it
I'm with maul. I want I want rb rebecca black out there
It's star wars
Gotta get with that star wars
What the fuck's happening with star?
It's about space wizards for children children
Just go back to the mandalorian
Well, that's the funny thing about the mandalorian
It's like we're all gonna have a discussion about it, right?
Like it's to be disco while this film we're all just looking at this giant film with a clown face
We're like, oh there he is. Look at him
Oh, yeah, that's right the the main movies
Yeah
Right then my my ideal ending I think to episode nine would be
It all ends. It doesn't even matter how it ends and then the final scene
Is a young luke skywalker wakes up and he's sweating and like a fever dream like he had a terrible nightmare
And then he looks around and he's on indoor and there's a bunch of partying e walks and he just had too much
Fucking e walk booze to drink
He passed out and had a terrible terrible dream and I was like, oh luke. Are you okay?
He's like, yeah, I just had this fucking terrible nightmarish fever dream
Thank god, it's all over and it didn't actually happen because that would be insane if it did
Oh, he like holds up a mirror. Oh my god. I'm not awful
I'm so glad to be me
Yeah, there were so many memes like that
So as a big expanding universe guy when they you know 2014 was like, yeah, we're doing our own thing now
There's so many memes like that of uh, you know, luke waking up in bed next to mara jade and being like
I just had a terrible dream list off all the shit that's not there anymore
And then she's like what did it he was like, it was a fucking mouse. She's like, let's kill it
So that that would be perfect
Anyway kicking on I guess with the next I don't I don't want to know anymore. I've already read it
We got rebecca black we're good
It's like a video game when you start thinking about how this old thing plays
It sounds like a video game where you have to have something that tracks you to this certain location
Yeah, he thinks that they got the story after or like a tracking fob to lead you to the exact location of a bounty
Yeah, pretty much but then the bad man shows up. Ooh
I thought I was dead, but I was wrong
I really won't that's either
His hands high in the air and his fingers wiggling
Don't you know ray?
Like a ghost when they find him
Did you guys know a terminator video game came out like this week? Yes. What's that? Yeah
Oh boy, i'm gonna have to look into this now later. Is it any good? I'm guessing not it's it's 86 positive on steam
But fall in order is like 90 percent. So who the fuck knows what that means
Fall in order like fine. Do you not like fall in order?
Six out of ten
I haven't I haven't gotten too far into it, but i'm enjoying it so far
It's not a shit show which at this point is what everyone's looking for from star wars. It's not a shit
I haven't heard of this. How did this a terminator?
Game came out because I have never heard of this because it released the same time as pokemon and fall in order
Like what the hell is it doing?
Go next week, dude
My wish list to not because I want it because I don't want to forget about it. Yeah, me too. How interesting
Maybe it's not terrible. Why I watched a couple videos about it's been about what it looks very meh
The mechanic it's the first person shooting the gun mechanics like okay
There's a like rpg light elements you can upgrade like how how well you can lock pick
But then, you know, you're thinking to yourself like oh, that sounds kind of cool
But it's like oh there's only like select things to lock picks. It's just not that meh
This is the this is the little
the description
Terminator resistance is a first person shooter set during the future war scenario
That was only glimpsed at in the iconic films the terminator and t2 judgment day
The machines are destined to lose but at what cost?
Well, I guess they're ignoring everything else. That's fine with me
All right
Just like right just like anything smart would do
except anything bad on dark fate
The bad people are gonna lose don't worry, but it would cost
I don't fucking know. Are you gonna invent? Are you gonna invent a character for me to give a shit about in this video game?
Terminator props to you if you manage to pull it off consider me dubious
dubious
Yeah, i'm gonna keep an eye on that you'll see
So, um back to the leaks here
uh
Disinformant an alien is acting as a middleman between the first order mole and our heroes the first order arrives and begins attacking the base
the assault causes forces
our heroes to make a hasty exit by what was described as
light springing
Away, okay. Wait, wait, so this film really close to the beginning has the resistance
Are the rebels fleeing from their base after being attacked by the okay?
Mm-hmm. All right light springing away
So light springing involves making the jump to light speed without plotting a course or a predetermined destination
So wait a minute. Hang on if that's a thing then how have that how has light speed collisions not happened yet?
If that's a thing well han warns that they're a possibility right in the new hope. I mean because the chances are
astronomically low
but it's still not a wise decision, uh, the part that was getting me I read ahead a little bit there was that um
It makes it so that uh, the first order can't follow their trail. Um
That's what that was the thing that was the thing I was talking about where
Because of ryan's stupid new rule of a hyperspace tracker jj was forced to be like
How do we prevent a hyperspace tracker now?
And their idea is you do a bunch of hyperspaces all over the place that aren't even coordinated and it throws them off
And i'm just like oh so that's like it's weird because that's considered in a lot of science fiction
especially if you go back to a lot of the short stories that were
made back even going back to the
60s 70s
When you had you know, the I get you some call it the golden age of science fiction stories
but
The idea that you would just make a wormhole jump or a slip space jump or whatever a warp jump
And not plot a course was basically suicide
Because you could end up anywhere and have no idea where you are and you have no way to get back to anything
And most of space like 99.9999999999 percent of space is just black void anyway
that essentially you're essentially committing suicide by
jumping in space without having a
Coordinate set in I just love the idea that that stops you from being tracked like it's like how how are we not able to follow?
Them? Well, they didn't know where they were going when they left so
Does the tracker like hack the tracker reads their minds
well, no is is the tracker supposed to be like a bug
in the um or like a like a mole a virus that
uploads the
the coordinates
That would have made more sense if they literally just had a tracker on the ship
Like it's been I still think which can happen in star wars
They should have made holdo a mole and she planted that onto their ship moldo moldo. Yes
But we can't do that. That would have ruined everything
for
And like like you said rags and pretty much all forms of science fiction including a lot of star wars before
You know disney bought it. Um, it was considered suicide and because you could run into a sun you could run to a black hole
You could run to a planet whatever the hell if you didn't use coordinates
But it wouldn't stop it from tracking you because they're just going to look at the angle you took to determine
Where you're going?
Um, because uh, you know that that's how it works how far I guess and yeah with the with the scale of space
It's one of those it's it's like picking it's like having it like a map of the universe. Hang on
And then you just randomly throw a dart. That means
They could have just light sprung in tlj, right?
Well, yeah, and then they I they could have just then the film wouldn't be able to happen though. What the fuck you can't
Boo
Problem god damn it also they call it light springing
Why not?
They kind of come up with something
I'd just like to point out that that this conversation and the specifics you guys are discussing is proof that you hate women
Oh shit, sorry
Damn it. You got me. I ran right into that one
You fooled. I don't need proof of that. I was I was just set up. I was setting you all up
I was letting you talk about the specifics. Was it the power I said boo? That's like a really big anti-women dog whistle
That's like that's half of the word boobies. Yep. Those aren't
Those are those are like, you know, you're trying to say men kind of boobies
No, no, no, no, no, no, but women do have those well a lot of the time you guys boob out of this damn it
You guys remember that the first halo game
Began essentially with the pillar of autumn making a blind slip space jump into space
Okay, then because that's basically again, like that's basically suicide to do but they do it to get away from the covenant
That's how like that's like in the halo books. That's such a big
That's a big deal making a slip space jump without any coordinates
Just to lead them just to get them to follow you somewhere random in space essentially
Like that's a big big deal. That's how halo begins essentially hold it light spurting
Just to make us all uncomfortable whenever they say it
also, um
Uh southpaw highlighted what if it like in this film they established that they only discovered this recently as a solution to the lights
hyper stripe tracking thing
Yeah, that's the only way they can explain that's the only way they can explain it
Yeah, I should hope so. Especially we got we get light squirting. How about light squirt?
Light smirking
Uh, all right, that's coordinates. I I didn't did did they did the pillar actually have
coordinates to installation 04
Uh, it's been a really long time i'd have to relook stop light splitting
All right, um
Also, how far can you so are they gonna explain to us how far?
You can go with the single
Jump because jumps still take time. Well, I think we have to wait for the film on this one
This sounds dumb and i'm sure they're gonna fuck it up
Yeah, we're definitely going to fuck it up. Yeah right now we just kind of have the cliff notes. So, um
Light spring involves jumps at which speed of course a pretty different negotiation as we all remember making a light jump
Making the jump to light speed with without precise calculations would have dire consequences such as flying right through a star or bouncing
Too close to a supernova
The falcon makes a handful of these springs to throw off the first order off their trail
But as a result, they are forced to deal with the consequences of such risky maneuver after surviving fly into a sun
How do you deal with the consequent
It sounds like they're gonna have the ship is gonna be like this
Gonna be like you're either just fine or you're just dead before you know, what happened. There's gonna be an alarm sounding
There'll be pieces of things falling off. There'll be like bits of gas going
And they're like, oh no, like oh what happened? Oh, no
status report, uh
But it'll be fine. It's just gonna be screaming
It'll be fun
Now that we know what happens when a a ship hit something else going at light speed
You have a whole galaxy of people doing this constantly
Like it's a normal thing to have hyperspace engines on your ships like man imagine the chaos and the carnage
Yeah, and yet although was the first one to crash through ships in light speed. Uh, bullshit
Have you guys heard that she's gonna be in this in rise of skywalker that lord dern's gonna be in
For fuck's sake she better not be a force ghost. Oh, it'll be so funny
She appears at the end for like the victory lap of the trilogy when they're like looking to all great characters a good met along the way
So that's her appearance. Yeah, they have um
uh
You know they've got
actually
Jay your idea
I prefer the idea that we're seeing that like poe and fin and ray are all standing like everyone's like clapping
It's amazing. We scan through different people who have survived. They're all there. That holder was just amongst them as the camera passed
Just offered to be there and it's like wait, but didn't you die doing the hyperspace ramp?
Hyperspace ramps are impossible. You fucking idiot. Oh
All she says no, I just I just autopilot today. What am I stupid?
I jumped out
I just wanted I just had to have you believe that I was dead
Because oh no, no something if palpatine is back to life
Then the light had to rise to meet it and that's her back to life as well. Oh, no. She's the ultimate good person
Or it's like that simpson spit what ralph. I thought you were dead. Nope
Oh my goodness
All right. All right
After surviving the dangers of light springing our heroes plot a course to the secret resistance jungle base
lucky
Yeah, all that all those
That crazy carnage happens and then when it's over it's like oh, no, that was that was a thing moving on
We turned it we won the lottery on that one guys
Well, I don't why don't people do this more often man. It's that easy
The unknown regions exegol
after obtaining vader's device
Kylo travels to the space the place specified by the wayfinder
It takes him to the unknown regions and the and a dead planet of flat black rock. I previously reported
Huh?
That just sounds like video game
Well, why don't they why do they call it the wayfinder it's just it's just a set of coordinates
Yeah, it's a map to luke skywalker
It's a map to luke skywalker god jj fucking sucks
Jesus
You know he'll make a ted talk about fucking
MacGuffins and you'll talk about how important they are for people and how we love macguffins since since the dawn of time macguffins man
We need them. We love macguffin boxes
What are macguffins but mystery boxes
I previously reported that the planet where kylo finds vader's wayfinder was called exegol
Since then my understanding has evolved. Okay, who's talking here?
This is the guy I guess doesn't understand the leaker the lights the lights squirter
Someone's talking here. They don't really specify since then my understanding has evolved that
I've been told that this planet actually bears that name
Kylo lands outside a giant cube floating just above the ground and begins walking toward it
Kylo walks between the cube and the ground and once he reaches the center
He discovers an elevator leading down below the planet's surface
What the fuck is this?
So I imagine this like monolithic thing. Yeah, just above the ground and he decides to fucking walk under it
You can guarantee there's gonna be so much stylish like look to this whole thing
Like it's gonna be filmed in such a way that's gonna create such well-composed shots
And we're just gonna be so mysterious. It's gonna look cool. I'm sure of it
What the fuck is even happening right now the cube
the cube of geju goo badongo
ancient jedi relic
Exegol sounds like a star gas station exegol
All right, so he
Come by get him a guffin
Yeah, he follows tail lift down that's a typo
Down and finds an old man near death and lying in bed. You know, it's not a fucking new ass character
They made up on this spot. You don't know
Is this gonna be tail lift is a is an alien
This is a fucking emperor in the yeah
Yep, tail lift the emperor
So tail lift down and finds an old man near death and lying in bed and being tended to by a cloaked aids
my sources
Aids oh no, not aids the full hang of the full gate of aids
Oh no failed
Aids
My source believes that these aids to be referred to as sith loyalists
Do not call my aids sith loyalist it's offensive
In our defense, it is funny
Full-blown sith loyalist full full-blown syphilis
It's
Uh, i'm sorry the old
The old man identifies himself as darth
He was here it's old man winters the whole time you're on this planet having a vacation
Kylo initially dismisses the old man knowing that the emperor has died over 30 years prior over the forest moon of and
All right. Yeah, when we have the film being like no you're dead fuck up film. I know you bring it back. Shut the fuck up
This is so bad
Feeling that this must be it. This is not good at all. This is veiled aids right now veiled aids
Cloaked aids close syphilis
Still syphilis
Feeling that this must be a trick kylo claims that there must be some other explanation such as this man must
Such as this man being a clone
My sources specifically tell me that the that the palpatine
Refutes the idea of him being a clone and affirms that he survived his fall. Fuck off
Well, it wasn't just it wasn't just the fall. There was a subject
Plosion that should have finished him off
I like the idea that he's like explain how you survive. It's like I survived the fall like okay, but there was another thing that happened
So like after the fall when the the planet sized spaceship exploded into nothing it was annihilated
I got I got better. I used the forest to reform my atoms
Stick it
This is why you know when they brought when they brought mall back when they brought darth maul back in the clone war
You know everybody freaked out because they love darth maul
But when you bring a character back who's been literally cut in fucking half and fallen like kilometers down a shaft
You can fucking bring anyone back. Yeah, well, maybe
Maybe the maybe it was like cloud city when luke fell it ended in a slope at the end
So it's he slowly slid, you know
Wait, maybe that's what happened
half of his body slid
And he couldn't he didn't have any legs
So well, I guess the legs fell with him, but he couldn't move him. So his he could
Couldn't stop himself. He just had his two arms and he was a little little out of it
You know, he's a little confused. What's going on
um
Naboo didn't explode as far as I fucking know. I I I hope one of those planets wasn't abu
actually, fuck it. I hope it was I don't give a shit and
and I guess just
You he he got better
He had a wayfinder. He had a wayfinder
Palpatine survived because the fall uh when he you know fell that gave him aids
Uh, but then the explosion gave him aids again and it canceled out. I was gonna say space aids act differently
That fought other aids. Yeah
How much do you think this has to do with the fact that that ryan killed snoke and they just don't have a they don't have
A big baddie. So they're like hey, let's bring back palpatine. Yep. Exactly 100 percent that
Yeah, it's like what if kylo's our big baddie? He's going who oh, right
I've always pictured that um
Like if just picture jj didn't see tlj don't know anything about it up until it was released and he was like
What'd you do with snoke by the way and he was like killed him?
He's like what do you mean?
He's like it was never really about snoke he's about kylo and he's like, yeah
It was it's a dart just about kylie. It's about more than one. Just what are you why? What are you about family?
So kylo's the big problem now, right like no kylo can't win anything
God fucking damn it, dude. That is true. That's sort of both our faults. But um
What happens?
He's back
He's like the one thing i've got is that yes, she beat him in a sword fight
But in a force fight kylo is going to destroy her and then again ryan's like
I can't do that at all. It's like what what do you mean? She she beats him in the foot. What are you cut down?
Yeah, think about this mauler
You remember you remember the uh the the little bit of text you sent me yesterday on the notes for today's show
You know, we you've planned out efap better than they did this equal
trilogy
I mean as with your little bitty couple of sentences, we're gonna cover this this and this jeremy
When this film releases as much as jj is gonna get a shit ton of all kinds of comments from all different kinds of fans
He will probably be like it's done
It's fucking done. I can live my life i'm fucking free of the star wars
I can go live my life in peace and happiness
Well, except he's going to warner brothers to run the entire dc universe. So we have that to wait. He is
Yes
Well, that needed to be worse. Oh my goodness. I didn't I didn't I didn't I need to hear that
Yeah
First trailer for the first movie done by him. It's like, you know batman had this device
No, no, no, no, no
Batman so open batman had a map to luke skywalker. He's like no jj. No
Batman it's not right
This is um star wars everybody this is it's just like fucking joke the whole thing
Oh, so yeah, there's
Keep going on i'm curious of the leaks explain if kylo's like oh you survived the how i was gonna say
We've got so much left. This is exciting. There's so much to work with here
Let's hear this explain
So after his defeat at endor he left the known galaxy and traveled to the unknown regions to rebuild his empire
Okay, so we're not gonna talk about the explosion
Yeah, he he survives the exploding death star
catches a ride someplace
lays low for a little bit, you know
He doesn't do this
Opportunity to regroup the empire
I can't imagine how awkward the exposition is going to be in this scene because this is something that we all have wanted to hear
Since force awakens and it's like
How did I survive did I went to a place?
Rebuilt the I could just imagine it's like after the explosion
He's just like this ship is just kind of floating through the area and then palpatine like is against their windshield and knocks
Hey, can I have a ride?
Like like like thor and in uh in infinity war. Yeah, exactly
I guess it's it's weird if that's the reason that he gives because wouldn't the best time to
Why why would he not?
Immediately go back to the rest of the empire and say all right. We're not done like I still have an empire
Right. No, like we're not finished
Yeah, because this was the interesting thing about the empire a lot of people like you kill the death star
It's all gone. It's like no, no loads is left. But the interesting thing is that you cut the head off
So what all of the lower sections do do they panic do they split apart?
And that seems to be something mandalorian is exploring. I don't I don't know what it's going to do with it
But um, I like that it's cool the idea that the empire splits into different smaller factions
So yeah, the emperor building in the first episode of the mandalorian then in all the sequel trilogy
That's what get us
If kylo asks any kind of question along the lines of like try and make this make sense
The emperor is just gonna be like starting to giggle like come on, mate
I can't make this make sense. No, really. I don't have an answer
So who was snoke? Oh god, are they gonna answer that is he gonna
Is snoke gonna be like a puppet or some shit from what I hear and I don't I don't know if it's in these leaks
From what I I don't think it's in these leaks. There was another uh leak I heard where
uh, kylo's explanation will be said but it's going to be a bit of
Uh, like a dialogue of like passing dialogue. It's not even gonna throw away line throw away. Yeah, i'm gonna get a throw away line for snoke
Yep, yeah
It's it's probably gonna make me explode in the cinema
Snoke was a hologram
What the
All right, so so star wars it's great it's still good it's still good. It's still good. It's still good
It's still good. It's great. It's not bad yet. I don't know what you guys are talking about
Three second rule
Three second or three movies. Yeah
Yeah, six depending on your point of view or seven or eight movie rule
So despite his skepticism palpatine begins to reel kylo in and subsequently tells him of something
Something known something known as force dead
Oh my god, could that just be why is he false dad?
Oh
Gosh, what is this? Keep keep reading keep keep going
But yeah something that consists of two elements or parts
Okay, dad, come on, you want to read it read it read it
The force produces two incredibly strong users and when they unite together both become a stronger than either one could be on their own
So it's it's dbc fusion
This is happening we're doing it grow
This is one of those things that as he explains this like we're in the audience like no, no, no stop stop
Stop roll it back pump the brakes pump the brakes. Stop it
I would like to see the the last the last little shreds the the the few tiny remnants of something you love
Just get crushed on screen
Just I never thought it would be pal palpatine is the ultimate villain because he's taking
Just the the last remnants of star wars and he's the one who's killing it. Truly palpatine is the ultimate villain of star wars
Killing star wars itself
You see here in the theater just every person is like getting upset except for like the three relos that are there who are just going crazy
Oh, yes force diet. I do it. Oh my god, they're gonna have to have sex to defeat palpatine. This was my dream
I can't wait to role play this
Will you be my force dad
I'm so sorry. I don't know why oh, yes, eric. Fuck me harder kill the emperor
All right do his voice
It's killing me really
So
Oh my god, let's let's uh, let's go over that one more time
The force produces two incredibly strong users and when they unite together both become stronger than either one of them can be on their own
Mm-hmm. The palace really has turned into the mcguffins like the force just oh my god
Okay
I guess I remember when it was like special that anakin was like made by the force
Remember that was a special thing like now now the force is just cranking them out whenever they need to happen
Palpatine believes that kylo Ren and ray to be the two halves of this
Ed shares this knowledge with ray note
I previously wrote that palpatine wanted them to become master and apprentice
Since then this has been clarified to me as palpatine seeking the two members of the diad
Wait a second. Wait, wait, so palpatine shares this with ray when?
Uh, well, I think like he's sharing this with kylo and ray is like unaware right now
before skype
It said that she it's shared with ray who's sharing this with ray where's she where's she there?
like
Did I she was one of the aids and shares this knowledge with ray? No, you're right
It says that alpatine believes kylo ren and ray to be the two halves of this diad and shares this knowledge with ray
Yeah, so where was ray? Where the fuck is ray? Is she like eavesdropping?
It might be a skype call skype call could be in yeah
Yeah, she could be she's typing in totally these guys begin watching all this play out right then and there
She thought she was going to see another shirtless kylo
And uh, well, I would love it if they commit to it and like the shots
The shots of ray having it explained to her all of her face like shoulders and up
Then when the scene is over it just pans back out. She's on the toilet. Like this whole fucking time was very serious conversation
She was just like
Probably have the same look on her face
Her pants are down nowhere equal now, huh?
I'd love for that to happen. And then she said how I haven't seen all that would be great. How dare you?
How dare you how dare you you stole my child know that
Seeking how between seeking the members of the diad what the fuck is this?
The members of it's a it's a mission in world of warcraft. You have to reform the diad and see
Something space bullshit magic spell fucking bullshit
You'll never awaken a dreamer blah blah blah
right
so palpatine claims that he seeks the diad because
He is weak and dying and wants wants the diad to rule together once he's gone now. He's weak and dying. Yeah, okay
Okay, explosion really took the energy out of it
Yeah, because i'm i'm really i'm really wondering how old he is at this point. It's like jesus christ. It's around a hundred
Yeah
He's like i'm almost dead. That's what dying does to you
He's been bleeding out for 30 years
I have a lot of blood
I have it still falling
It's called forced blood if you collect it all you can make a forced diad
Palpatine orders kylo to bring rey to him and turn her so that the diad will be strong
unified forces of the diad
What the fuck is happening it sounds like a like a die like an actual like
This this floating cube is the diad that they have to power it or something. We're just like what?
See, so this was the thing about uh, the the ninth episode
I remember talking to this about this with the whole like to repair
Is gonna take a lot of work, but fuck it. They're just doing their own thing. They're just going with it. It's like going
Repairs, I don't think so. We're just we're gonna the diad. That's what we're doing with the way fight
Just wait diad strategy diad strats
Just wait to the last the next sentence. The next sentence is more ridiculous
Okay. All right. So palpatine also reveals that he has been amassing an army of star destroyers equipped with darth
Star tech death star tech. Sorry i'm i'm
My eyes are blurry here each one capable of destroying a planet on its own
Bigger more deadlier
this is
This is more dude. This is the meme jj
Are you unaware of this like this will be to think of you you're like
I could destroy one you get one death star one planet in the originals
Okay, one death star one one planet at the end of of the originals
You're like, oh, yeah, so they kept it the stakes are relatively the same new one one planet
One one well one planet death star five planet kills you're like, oh
Army of them infinite planet kills infinite
What each boom boom boom boom boom? It's gonna be oh, can you imagine he's gonna fucking palpatine?
What are you what are you ruling over?
They're all if you're gonna blow up all the planets. What's there to rule over?
Dude i'm picturing a scene we're gonna live on
Asteroids i'm picturing a nightmare scene for one of the characters where they imagine what happens and it's just this like this is a billion dollar cgi
Scene where it just blasts all over the universe and rocks and fire everywhere and jj is just like this is star wars
Have you guys heard the rumor about ray lifting the death star over jakku
Jakku is it? Yeah, it was jakku
Wait, what?
Well, so when we get a little further down, I think that there's I think that was a misinterpretation of the leaks
I think that it's going to be on this plan that we get to later in the leaks. Okay. Okay. Yeah
I thought it was jakku at least that's the first one that I saw but uh,
Am I get it mixed up either way either way? It doesn't really matter what planet it is
The fact that that's even out there and the fact that that we can actually believe that it's possible just shows what type of nonsense
I swear to god if this is a parody
This is a parody if she moves it like a star destroys the point of like crashing it or pushing it whatever else in the
Cinema, I want someone in the cinema to throw popcorn at the screen, please
No
Because so a little later on they're gonna because this fucking wayfinder leads them to a part of the death star and it's
This massive piece that's randomly in an ocean. I'm pretty sure we're gonna see her lifted out of the water
Yeah, probably I hope at this point. I do hope it happens. I mean the more nonsense the better for me at this point
I have no
Expectation for this movie other than to laugh at it. Yeah, go for it. Just fucking go
We take alcohol to the theater
It's comedy. You can you can do that. I'm gonna put it in a bowl
I'm not gonna check your pockets. It'll just be vodka and i'll be like this is plain water
Just take it in a medicine bottle
Yeah, the only the only uh only bringing my medicine in the theater what I need it for my diabetes
Was joker, so I think it'll be good
Anyway, this is the movie that really has the shooting at it
So, yeah palpatine what is that next line what rounding up children so pal
Yes palpatine reveals that he has been amassing an army of star destroyers equipped with death star tech allowing it capable of destroying a planet
On its own generals hucks and pride are tasked with rounding up children in large numbers to train and staff is armada
rounding up children just
And I was gonna highlight children tend to have adults around them, uh, and those adults can be pesky
Now we've already established that there's like planets of slave children, that's okay
You can't even specify that it just it makes it sound like they just visit random planets like godly kids will take them
They visit with like a like a wave
The black ships from war hammer
Well, all they gotta do from planet to planet and take all the kids and they'll be back in 10 years or whatever
They can start with uh, they can start with canto bite with all the unrescued children. Just take those
Oh
We're not the horses you monster take the children instead, please
Just take our horses
Ooh
Whooey, I think we're uh
Almost halfway through this right. We're already dying
All right, uh, we ready to move on sure uh, yes, all right
so
The resistance is jungle base
Finn and po return another base
This is the one that ray was being trained on is it the jungle I believe so. Yeah, okay
Uh, they return to the resistance base burying the knowledge obtained from their encounter with the first order informant
This duo brings this knowledge to general lea and tell her what they know about kylo's mission to the unknown regions
But without any leads to where he went or how he got there the resistance is at a dead end again, man. I was gonna say
Remember like she carrying fishers dead
Well, this is gonna be odd
We're gonna be watching all of us gonna be watching this confused like exactly how what trickery is being used at all times
Also, I like that it says the resistance at a dead end
It's like how many of them are even there to acknowledge this? Is it 20 still or have they just got a brand new army from nowhere?
Actually, they're gonna have a brand new army brand new army. Yeah
brand new army
Laya mentions that she has a contact who is seeking a link in the unknown regions long ago and may be willing to help
Laya dispatches the two of them along with ray chubaka bb8 and c3po to passana
To meet with her contact and see what help you do. It's vital that you you go with him c3po
I know how reliable you are. Well, he's he's gonna be the most important, right?
He's gonna get that upload or whatever's happening in the trailer. So I guess it's like r2d2 c3po
I really need you guys to go with them for reasons
Well again, I don't know where the hell r2d2 is
Uh, but bba and c3po are gone
So sure laya mentioned she has a contact who was seeking a link to the unknown regions
Long ago. Well, what does that mean? Exactly these days her? Yeah, forget it. Yeah, i'm confused too. Uh, all right
next up so
I'll read the next one too passana when our heroes arrive on the planet. They discover
That a giant festival is going on
What they thought would be an easy mission has now turned into a much more complicated affair. Oh god. No, there's a party
It's gonna be so much harder to blend in with all these people outside
No, this is our festival of no violets ever for any reason
I was like, oh shit chewy. What are you holding there? Is that is that a weapon? He's like no
uh, no, this is uh, um
A cigarette lighter there's uh, it's like other people cooking utensils
They they attempt to lay low and blend in
Unsurprisingly chewbacca struggles with blending in because it's very difficult to hide as seven foot
Damn good storytelling right there. So he's damn fine. I guess not all aliens are welcome then it's more of a
I I guess because they said it's hard to blend in it's like don't you just require to be a
Well, not even a human entity. You can just blend it. I guess these people are like hey
You're not one of us
One of us, uh, I suppose it depends. Yeah what what the planet is or whatever they have any visitors, but
uh
Ray encounters an alien in the crowds who takes a liking to her. No way
With the hand made necklace as a gift. I hope she just slaps out of his hand and beats a shit out of
I just I just like as a for a change
One of the characters that ray encounters is either interested in her or likes her what a crazy thing to have happen
Yeah, I would interview him later and be like so what actually were you interested in?
Just out of curiosity. Like what did you what did you see that? I cannot see the guy like reply that she's the protagonist
He's a protagonist. You're like, oh
I just really take a liking to women whose mouths are just a little open as they gaze into nothing
Yeah, I can just sense how fucking pure she is at a distance and I wanted to be some of that pure
Poon tang, I guess
Exactly. Just likes her so much. Just hands her another my alien cock in her amazingly perfect aura
Just in her aura yeah just in her aura her orifice one might even
Uh
She's asked her name and she responds ray when asked her family name she replies that she does not have one
Oh, this is a setup for a thing
She's a solo I have a doubt no, no, she's gonna say ray palpitied obviously
What a great thing to set up halfway through the last movie of your trilogy
uh
Let's see. Where was I? Uh, she probably she doesn't have one
At this time kylo establishes a connection with ray through their bond
Wait, so they can still do that even though
My god
He was the guy who did that. How do they have a bond?
Because apparently he opened it up and he left it open like a phone off the hook. That's how it works
Yeah, I I guess if you start a skype call and you die during the skype call it does stay
It it does stay open
Sure
What the fuck ever? I'm totally using that joke in the film. That's like the dialogue that they have
Wait, isn't isn't snoke dead and then they literally write
That's how they justify it's like it should be closed off it's like well, you know how skype works
Anytime they're not using the bond you see very faintly in the background
Do yeah just
Now kylo can watch you whenever you take a shower
All he did was uh, look at his uh force monitor and get her force contact number and that's it
I just like this is the time has passed right?
I just pictured that they got really like boring and normal for them to have these calls and eventually she like
They just have a call just like seeing new episode of batwoman. He's like no
No, it's better than a show
We didn't confirm that this takes place a year after the last jedi. Is that correct?
Yeah, it's at least a year. Um, yeah, but think about that. This entire trilogy is is like a year. It's all
Oh my gosh a lot of stuff happens in a year, I don't know
No for character
Including surviving a death star explosion. That's a pretty big one
Yeah, that's the fucking thing. I don't even understand what the fucking first order is
I don't I don't think we're gonna get an explanation of it in this one either
But I guess i'd have to read 80 million books in comics to figure it out
But yeah, they have no structure
At all and they don't you don't get a grasp that they're intimidating at all
They feel like they're they do feel like a parody of the empire, which is what they are
But they don't feel that it doesn't seem like they have any control in the galaxy and it doesn't seem like they're taken seriously
At all, we don't know anything about the government. It's just a joke
You know
It feels like the first order lives in a bad neighborhood and most people just stay away from it
That's kind of how it feels star wars, you know, like as those guys they shoot people every now and then just drive around
You know just so be in a space bad neighborhood come to you
All right, so their conversation ends with kylo grabbing the necklace from around raisin neck
Oh
assault
Sexist right there sexual harassment. Are you fucking kidding me?
This necklace proves to be the key for the first order to discovering their location
What? Oh
Okay, a random ass villager just says whoa. I like that chick. Here's a McMuffin
I'm so out of it. There's a mcdonald's nearby
Space mcdonald's
And a necklace
Yeah, just I mean, you know as much as that's fucking hilarious like
Hey ray, here's a necklace. Okay next seed. I know that necklace. Oh the bad guys find the good guys. Oh, wow
How unlucky how
Planet and the one fucking person on the whole planet who had that one device just happened to give it to the
genuinely
JJ doesn't know how to not write in a contrived way like a wonky donk
Going through the force awakens in excruciating detail. Like everything is a coincidence
Every single fucking event in the whole film is just like oh, that's just how that happened. Wow
Yeah, it's not like the story is built off of a coincidence that happens. No, no, no, no, no
It's all coincidence. I just love the idea that kyla grabs a necklace. He's like, I know this fucking necklace
I used to gut them all the time like from that planet
Well, and it makes me like so are they saying are they now saying that
During their four spawn when they're like telepathically like he can physically interact with the environments
Like is that what was established? They were yeah tlj had the rain on his hand if you remember
Oh, yeah, I guess you're right. Yeah
Are you sure that it wasn't just his incel sweat?
Because he was talking he was talking with a girl
Well, I mean, you know, there is a bit I don't know how the rules work because you remember ray shoots at him
In the first we're at the point where we can't deny that some oh no
Well, I've been I mean your thing is probably 100 true
But what i'm talking about is she shoots at him you remember and then he goes whoa
He's not actually shot and it's just like oh lucky that didn't transfer your web
Yeah, and that's what I mean
Like when so and the same thing with like luke and tlj when he is doing the force projection
He's able to interact with things like how does he have those fucking dice? I don't get that. Um
But he's able to interact with things
But he's not able to be interacted with kind of I guess with the lasers and the lightsaber through him
I just don't make any sense the rules. Yeah, the dice disappeared. I guess the dice do disappear
Which means the necklace will disappear
No, there's a different force power they're using they're using skype force
Luke was using holy moly, dude
Like this is something that they should have tapped into like we can literally transfer things across the universe in split seconds
If we harness this jedi and it's like no only snoke was powerful enough to do that
Except with snoke. Oh, yeah, that's what I mean. It's like these these the only one who could do it like he's dead
Like oh
So wait, what happened? How does snoke fit into this uh, like ultra powerful force user situation?
It's just not part of it
Wait, what? Oh, do you mean with with the he seems like he was more powerful than ray or kylo
You mean the dyad?
He was a dyad with the emperor palbertine but palbertine's not gay. So but neither of them are light
It doesn't matter. He's not gay
Oh
I don't know. I don't know if they have to be light because the emperor wants to turn ray to
Have like yeah, he said he needs to do another dark part of the dyad
Oh
Okay, fuck it knows that nobody understood guys hot take this isn't gonna be good
You don't say you just hate women oh yeah
Yeah
God all right. So the necklace is the key to the first order discovering their look
Um after the connection ends ray warns her comrades that the first order is on their way and as they must
How does that happen?
I should she rejects it or something. Oh, she revokes her
I believe she revokes her consent. Can you imagine this you're like you're like on this really awkward mission trying to get
Any kind of foothold for the fucking resistance because this first order this pesky first order just has infinite resources
And you're like your friend just entered a skype call and told the enemies where you are. You're like ray. What the
Really? It's embarrassing. He does uh, kylo recognize the necklace. He also makes it very clear to her that he does
It's like oh, I know exactly where you are now
Yeah, unless she just she knows that he will know from that necklace where they are in the universe
Specifically you know that aren't they in like the outer reaches as well as something because they're contacting somebody who knows stuff about the fucking
Out out out out land like yeah, are they in the unknown regions?
They could be like an uncontacted society and that's why they can't be aliens there, right?
I'm this is the thing, right?
We're reading this and i'm like, okay
Maybe the flesh on the script will explain this and i'm like, this is probably the fleshed up version what we're reading right now
The flesh on the script is going to make it worse
probably
Um, so race's first order is on their way
Uh, and it was hurry to find lay his contact
It is at this point that instead of finding their contact their contact by the guy that you'll sell
Well, their contact reveals himself to them after having spotted an old wookie friend of his out of the crowd
It's lando calrissian
So that that's who leo was referring to that this is I forgot he's in this too. Yeah. Oh my god
The nights of rin haven't popped up yet
Yeah, remember that's a thing
How am I going to be able to review this film in under 12 hours like
It's there's no way now, dude
Won't land out a flirt with ray so bad
No, they'll they'll fuck him up but I once fucked they'll fuck him up
He's going to be like I would hate to be inappropriate, but I believe you to be attractive
Do you do you uh, do you give me your consent to compliment you
I think it's far more likely he tries to get it on with
Well, dude you're gonna want to keep lando away from the falcon like dude, hey, whoa, okay
Look, we're on a mission. I know you want to mess around but
After okay, so they keep walking on like they keep walking in on lando with his dick in a different part of the powder
Oh, I just realized what if what if l3 comes back? No
Oh my god, and then she speaks to the p.a
Oh, it's so nice to see you again, it's like no we don't care no one cares
Stick it in me one last time. Please tell me the exhaust pipe, please
Lando tell me the robots have rights now. Do the robots have rights yet?
I would love to see one of the droids and say you look absolutely beautiful
I just start sexually harassing r2d2. He's gonna kiss your interface
Just like oh well, thank you, sir. Uh, I can see a prank on people
Uh, all right, he's heard about mother's board you got there
Uh, you don't be even better than him flirting with ray. If if he if he sees rayann's like i'm good
Well, she she's like expecting it she does reputation she's like hey and he's like, okay
All right
Watch that capacitor anytime
And I I think so I think that everyone's together right so it's po fin and ray finally all together
Uh, oh, yeah, that's a big deal because
No, it's not
It'll be interesting to see how fin deals with someone flirting with ray. I
That's still a thing. I don't know
It's kind of hard to remember the dynamics for any of these characters because there's only there's only room for one black man in this relationship
It's kind of crazy
The if you if if anything significant happens between ray and fin in this which seems from the trailer to be a possibility as in like
They're hanging out. They may have a moment. Whatever. It's just like, oh, yeah
We had that whole film where they just skipped all this time that they could have made their relationship meaningful. Huh? How about that?
Yeah, yeah well
greetings greetings and introductions are exchanged and lando tells them of
A dagger that may help them find what you're fucking kidding me
a dagger another macguffin
You mean like like a like a sharp pointed medley short bit it's gonna be a special dagger that has coordinates in it, right?
Oh, so it's like the the data knives from titanfall, okay
And then when they get the dagger like this dagger will lead you to the obelisk and you'll be like, oh, okay
One of this one of the top comments on the post is that there are what there are like five fetch quests in the first act
Um
And see false awakens was just one big fetch quest that both sides were interested in now we've got
How we've both had three we've had the kylo one, uh after
No, no, we have four. We literally have four
Kyla for the wayfinder then kyla for palpatine and then we've had uh
The resistance for lando then the then the resistance for the dagger. That's four. We need one more and it's five
Oh
Just given each character a fetch quest and done them all at the same time
Well, that wouldn't be better
Well carry on I guess
Many years prior lando and luke went in search of this dagger that was owned by a syph loyalist named ochi
Spelling not confirmed
They tracked ochi to passana when the trail went cold
And evidently landos of sauna. I tried evidently he's still fucking there years later
Uh, we met with the question of why oh, here we go why he never left the planet after the search like ochi
That's just like ochi
Classic ochi am I right guys ochi's fucking dead rags pay attention. They're talking about fucking lando staying there god, who cares about ochi?
Classic lando stay appreciate there. You need to pay some respect to ochi. Fuck ochi. I hate him
I'm taking a I kind of like ochi. I think he's on the right side in this thing
We established what gender or race or pronouns ochi uses ochi?
I'm, sorry the more we say ochi the more of a fucking goofy name it becomes like good old ochi
Ochi's the secret skywalker ochi the dagger maker
Ochi sent me high
Oh
nice combo meme
Fucking ochi ochi has the mcmuffins. That's probably that's the relevance to the plot here
So so yeah, how many so we've got three mcmuffins now we've got
We've got a tracker a dagger and a necklace
Dude check out this law like read on what is this law?
I know so
Uh the search for or when met with the question why he never left the planet after search for ochi and his dagger ended
Lando tells the team that he had a young child at the time of his and luke's quest and everyone glances at fin
No, no, he's adding that but that's what we're all thinking it's like is it fit
Please don't be fin
When they were out searching for the dagger the first order stole his child after oh that makes sense
Abner failed to protect his child from the first order
Lando and luke parted ways and he stayed on passana ever since
All right, it's been here for this conversation
The story strikes a chord with fin
Having been stolen from his own family at an incredible young age as well
Lando points them in the direction of the last known coordinates of ochi's ship where the trail went cold all those years ago
Wishes them luck and succeeding where he failed all those years ago
But decides to sit this one out
Why?
So he stayed on the planet because his kid was stolen
Yes
That doesn't make sense lando
It also doesn't make any sense if he tells them hey, this is where the trail ran cold
But I wasn't able to find him after the trail ran cold. So i'm gonna stay here
You know, okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, but like you're on you're on a planet you have a kid you're searching for a dagger
You couldn't quite find the dagger. You've got you've got a lead, but it went cold and your kid is stolen
What do you do stay on the planet?
Fuck it. I didn't like him anyway though
I like his fucking face reminded me of his mom
Also going to reveal that lando was mace windu's son
Can you imagine can you imagine if fucking mace windu ain't alive after getting
Dude I take it at this point just have samuel jackson reacting to all this stupid shit motherfucker
Black people are related. He's like, oh, yeah, he sees palpatine
Fucking walks into the room pal. He's like motherfucker. You still alive. What the fuck?
I do you have a fucking building. You chopped your arm off and he's like don't you give that shit to us?
I watched the damn movie motherfucker vibe
People are actually going to argue that this ruins tlj because you've got like low
Yeah, you've given important lineages now. That's gotta be so much fun to watch. Oh, yeah
Yeah, it was the tlj fans tear themselves and ironically episode nine looks like it's gonna power efap until well past me and rags are dead so
Dead from veiled aids god, uh, our heroes when we are dyad
Our heroes follow the trail that land of uh fin po re chubaka bba
I assume right. Yeah, our heroes. I forget he it should be quoted our heroes
Follow the trail that lando pointed out to them and eventually they happen to ochi's ship
Uh, I guess oh
Wait, what hang on it's ray sees the ship and it triggers memories. Okay
Okay that woman
yay
But like it's gonna have nothing to do with her, but she loves jedi memories and it'll lead them to the next clue
I hate you. JJ can't make a story to save your life
But well, that's the next part
You got to realize what he's working with. Yeah next part
Okay, there's like if if I hand you a bunch of like rubble and i'm like make a house, you don't have piss all over it
So here's the thing it's the same ship that we see leaving jack
Oh my god, i'm dying
So ray and fin's parents just happen to be in the same place. Hey, man
It could be anyone's sister one of their brother and sister
We have not got confirmation. Okay, it's who knows who fins. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do this anymore
I want to listen where you decide to steal them the film
We just listened to jake paulin instead of reading the rest of this, uh every day bro or something
That would be better at this point like this is how bad this is. This is so bad
What a twist
Well before the implications of this can sink in the ground beneath them gives out and the crew gets sucked below the surface
Okay
Of course that happens
below my surface
Uh, they find themselves in a series of underground tunnels where they discover the remains of ochi
And the dagger and the dagger that lando luke saw it
So literally all that happened is they've walked to the point where lando pointed and they find the fucking dagger god. That's so shit
That is so shit also I love the idea that one of the characters is like heavily invested in ochi
Like they see this skeleton. They're like
Oh
They just walked to a random place the ground came like oh, hey that's the thing we're looking
Thanks planet god fucking damn it dude, she didn't deserve this
Ochi did not deserve this
Ochi was my favorite. I like
Uh, again, jesus ray feels a very strong connection to this weapon
You feel pretty bad about that disrespect towards ochi now don't I do ochi does it better
Ochi was the most interesting part of the week. And now here we are
Turns out ochi is just like a codename in the script for jaja
Chat hey f's in the chat for ochi guys
Oh
G was the og
Oh, man will be missed sad will be missed pretty sad
Let's see so uh again a strong connection to can articulate it jesus. It's almost like we had that in the force of awakens
Um, the dagger has writing on it in a language that nobody can identify
It's then handed over to c3pl. Thank god. He came
Uh who identifies the writing as a syph language?
But reveals he's unable to translate the writing due to restrictions in his programming. What?
Okay, well i'm not allowed to tell you what this says
Then just give us I can't say the
I
Must be given the inward pass by my creator
Creator again. Oh, yeah, remember fucking darth vader built you don't forget everyone ever
Let's not forget darth fucking vader built c3po and he's just here. Everything's connected
The force
I need to give a shout out to the efap for a making a more interesting character in 10 minutes with ochi than disney's
in this entire trilogy
Oh, she was a fucking legend. Let's be honest. Yeah. Yeah
Wait till you guys find out that the mandalorian leaks that ochi is the mandalorian. Uh, oh
i'm on board with this
Um
God i'm honestly surprised ray wasn't just immediately with the knowledge to just read that shit. So
What a twist
Yeah, she's like, oh I met someone who knew that language. I downloaded
Downloaded it from skype someone else learned that like someone else learned the opposite language
So my language knowledge rose to meet their opposite language knowledge
That's how the force works now
Look at this though at this time a plan is made to hack
C3po's programming to bypass the restrictions. Like wouldn't you just do this anyway? Wouldn't this have been a thing to do?
Why not why put right the restriction in there if you're going to immediately remove it
Yeah, what the restriction is he can confirm that he can read syph, but he cannot
One last look scene, right? It's read only rags. He can't he can't speak it. Yes
I'm fluent in over six more million forms of communication
Uh, but I can't talk about this one
Well wait at that point, you know, maybe i've misunderstood this but could you just trick it and be like, okay
C3po don't think about it. Just describe to us in english a different completely unrelated thing
But also describe the thing just just do it just to say random english words
You know, I mean like like a weird way of bypassing it like I don't know if you heard about this but
Um, there was a conversation was leaked between two people where it was illegally quote unquote recorded
but what the guy did
Was transcript all of it from his recording and then delete and deny the recording ever took place and just say it a really
Good memory and he wrote it down, which is not illegal
Oh, yeah, you can get like what i'm trying to say is if c3po's are they he could confirm to them that he can read it
but he cannot
Translate it. I just be like, okay
Don't just do a completely random different thing that also happens to be the same as this one. Can you programming allow that? I don't know
Yeah, I can see c3po being a fussy little bitch about it though. Uh, and not doing it
Find a workaround because then it shares a fucking good thing that c3po was randomly told to go with them
Yeah, it must well lay ahead intuition through the
That's what happened. I fucking guess I guess she just knew the whole time
From the trailer. It looked like he's gonna have to die to do whatever they're doing
All right. He has to die to say the n-word. I just well, yeah
Like he's like taking one last look about he's like shut the fuck up c3po you're actually getting killed for this
Like why would that kill you? I don't know. I'm asking too many things without knowing enough yet. So
He's just gonna go blind. He's gonna go blind. That's what's gonna happen. He's gonna turn into ray charles. So what he's talking about
So luckily so they need to make this plan to hack into
Luckily poe mentions that he has an old contact that might be able to help them out. Of course he does
Chewbacca randomly takes possession of the dagger and the group's attention shifts randomly
Okay. Yeah, okay. Give it to chewbacca did something
Yeah, you can't make him useful
Yeah, um and the group's attention shifts to finding a way out of the caves what is also what is with this I have an old contact
Oh, okay. It's just land giving the n-word pass. I have an old contact too
All right finding a way out of the caves and didn't they get in there because the ground caved in can't they just like climb
Back out. No, there's gonna be a way out. That's normal
I can't believe this has happened like what the fuck just saying
There's a group
Randomly throughout this how did we get here? Yeah
During during their escape attempt. Oh the team runs into a giant very aggressive sandworm who presumably
who presumably created the tunnels
Wait, hang on. So why was the skeleman down there then?
It was from the last time it came down
Okay
A battle with the sandworm ensues and our heroes end up backed into a
Preparing to meet their fate when ray notices a detail
The worm is injured in a display of previously unknown power. I'm gonna stop you there. Oh
In a display of previously unknown power, okay
What is she doing is just deleting it like I don't even
Well, she's able to heal it satiating the wind and providing the heroes a chance
So the worm is happy to be healed and they can escape
Because that's how animals work. Dude, dude, dude ray has false healing now
No, no take take your animal to the vet and see how much it likes you
I would be died for nothing at this point. So she's doing the
Born in the lion's paw story in this shit. Yeah, it looks like and I mean that hasn't been done before so that's totally cool in you
Ray wanks off the worm and it's like
Idea how much I needed that I don't have arms
Thank you for tugging on my sandworm
I can't believe the idea that she's unlocked a previously unknown powerful ability. I'm like ray. Stop it. Stop it
They're trying to make it canon now that she is like just a magic like prophecy force user like hanakin was
And that that's why she has all these new abilities. So they have to keep giving her random
You say you say like consistent you say like ada kid was ada kid was very fucking limited when he was
I mean, it's interesting. He was a magic child with magic ability. Like, you know, he was
Prophesized to be very powerful not quite like on steroids with ray
Yeah, I was gonna say he wasn't a dyad though when you're a dyad, that's what you you know
How is it that she defeats kylo?
How does she defeat kylo so easily several times if he's a part of the dyad as well?
Because he's just a bit of a wank. Okay
He called him a boy he called him a boy
Fucking legendary debate
Debates again. Yes, so so is twitter debates and twitter a gay
Uh, I think that this is just
I was gonna say do you want should we trade it over who wants to take up next rags jeremy or jay?
Who wants to go next?
Well, let me use the loo while I fucking
Speaking of leaks
Nice
Um, I got it once the crew exits the cave system they see a first order star destroyer in the sky
They arrive quickly, I guess yeah
Good stuff. All right
And know that kylo ren has found them once they realize
This they correctly reason that the first order would have already found the falcon
Making that plan
of escape impossible
The falcon is boarded and subsequently taken over or taken by the star destroyer in an act of desperation the crew boards
ochis should
Returning to lore as only ochi can sorry
But so when they knew that the first order was coming from they didn't have somebody go and get the ship
Like stay with the ship do something with the ship. They're just like oh fuck it
But they probably
Correctly reasoned that it takes literally days to travel in hyperspace to different planets
So maybe they didn't think they'd be that close
Yeah, i'm interested to see how far away the first order were when they found this information out
But I don't know that they're going to provide us that kind of information
Are they going to keep it consistent that kylo hates the falcon like blow that piece of junk out of the sky?
Oh, right. Yeah, he hates the falcon. He's kind of rationally angry when he sees it
Oh, they hate that ship
What
But he's got a few times you get a feeling about something
Sometimes you get a feeling about something and I knew ochi or ochi
I was gonna say ochi
Ochi
Ochi got out the uche one airy by the way
The ochi and scratchy show
Oh man, oh that's good. All right, uh, the crew boards a uchi's ship
And attempt to get it working. It's on the ship that the crew discovers the new droid dio
Oh the hair dryer this is the hair dryer one. Okay. Have you got seen this one? Yeah. Yes. Yeah
What hair droid?
Hair dryer droid we have those they're hair dryers. It's in the no
It's in the trailer. It's the little green thing
Listen the last fucking thing that I need is to have my hair dryer giving me lip at the beginning of my days. All right
Uh, and you commentary from my appliances all day
It's returned right rags. Uh, so, uh ochi has uh returned so oh, right
Yeah rags get you caught up, right?
All you missed was they got they got away from the creepy whim obviously
And then the first order arrived on the planet and they correctly assumed that it's too late to go back to their ship
Because that'll be captured and it is and so they decide to go on to uchi's ship
Oh ochi fucking I don't even care anymore and they decide to get that working and that's that's where we're at
Okay, I'm having trouble
Uchi's name now because I've never been reminded of uchi
Say it now
Ray says that kylo is coming for her so she takes oh no
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, no, no skype
To confront him and buy her friends some time
This is where the thai interceptor flips sequence from the first teaser takes place. Okay
While kylo and ray are engaged
Ooh, ray like I do
Raylo confirmed right he's he's coming for her and then they get engaged
Start beating off out there on twitter, um, while kylo and ray are engaged the knights of rinn there they are
There they are there they are the knights of ram head for ochi ship
They're just here now, okay
Yeah, we finally have the knights of rinn who were announced before the fucking force awakens
We finally have the knights of rinn now in the fucking sequel trilogy the knights you didn't read the thai in comic book
Jeremy thai in comic book
Oh
Damn, we should read the book
While kylo and ray are engaged the knights of rinn in the first order head to uchi's ship
And our other hero ochi ochi ochi ochi. It's ochi. Yeah, ochi
McMuffin guys
First order head to mcmuffin guy's ship and our other heroes jubaka splits off from the group
And the knights of rinn in the first order head to mcmuffin guy's ship. Oh, I read I read the same fucking line
But it captured the dagger is taken from him and he boards a first order prisoner transport
Ray and kylo
Someone just sent me this on discord
Oh my goodness
Are
He's begrudgingly giving him the pass okay
Left arm
I'm I'm I'm opening up to save I open it up to save it to my computer and it just says n word pass
Listen all black people have two left arms
It's either so good a basketball I guess
That's the secret is to have two left
Oh
Oh, this is the thing
Memes are just oh my goodness saved. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that needs to be saved
Oh
Oh my god, my face hurts
It was good that was good. Oh my goodness, man the joy of this fucking image
Is the plot of this
If you guys are not aware this is one third that we've nearly finished a third where's the rest
Yeah, i've got i've got the links to the two
Just to be about wrapping up fucking hell
Well, like this is the thing
I said that we'd be covering what happened on twitter and then the star wars leaks and to jeremy and he's like
Oh, yeah a couple of hours like probably like 10
It just kind of seems like with the way things are going it looks like everything's being hastily wrapped up
Which is why I thought this was no we got two more acts to go through
Oh, wow, it's not all about oh gee
God damn it
Thank you, it is about ochi, okay
not
Not disrespect the great ochi all the sacrifice mcmuffins and uh
jokes
All right
Ray and kylo both notice chubaka being taken captive and being brought into the transport ship during their competition
Chubaka get caught
Well, it says chubaka splits he split off from the crew
All right, he split off from the crew and convenient randomly. He was the one who got the dagger
How is it the chubaka will be able to delay the knights?
He's just gonna get killed how is it that he doesn't get killed also, why the fuck yeah
If his whole thing was delaying the knives, why would he take the dagger with him?
No, even in the script even in the leaks is like they randomly give it to chubaka is like yeah something's gonna fucking happen
Yeah, yeah
Wouldn't they wouldn't chubaka been like i'm gonna go delay the knights guys take the knife, you know
Wouldn't it would be like no, no, no, let's all stick together as a party also that
God damn ship takes off ray shifts her attention from kylo to her captured friend and begins to use the force to stop
The transport and pull it back to the ground. What wait i'm sorry. What is this?
Oh, no
Isn't kylo right next to her isn't he just gonna fuck her up?
Remember when yo that he gets one of the guys guys kylo attempts to counteract it by pushing the ship away
It's just gonna break the shit. Why wouldn't he just attack ray?
Because he's dumb
Okay
Because he's struggling with the dark side the light side is a wood killer
It does say they're engaged. So they're clearly like that means to me that they're in light
Yeah, they're right. They're right next to each other
Yeah
and I and I it's
Remember in episode two attack of the clones
Right the movie star wars movie
When at the end there's the dukie fight and yoda he stops
He stops the rocks from falling and he's and it's like a big fucking deal that he stops like a rock from falling on
Obi-wan Kenobi
Right. That was like a huge deal like while he was straining to do it
It's really tough because rocks are heavy as shit because they're mad at rock
So and so it was like a big deal and now ray's like nah, just this whole fucking spaceship
Nah, you're not you can't leave. I am more powerful than your hyperdrive mega engines
I think it is time we addressed what comes next
What happens next go ahead
Control or let's see. So kylo attempts to counteract this by pushing the ship away
Control over the ship becomes a battle between kylo and ray much like their battle for anakin's lightsaber. Oh
Well, we know who wins this explode and they die
Keep going
Kylo begins to gain the upper hand which angers ray in her frustration lightning shoots what?
What I don't want to talk I don't want to repeat this
I don't want to do it
Do it you have to don't give in
Do it so
Please delay it rags talk. I don't want to I don't want to do it
So just to confirm you said that lightning comes out of her
Yes
One of the most renowned and difficult to master sith powers
Force lightning and she fucking does it by accident. She's just she was frustrated
I don't know how she loses anything to kylo
Oh, I know she doesn't she's she's worried about losing i'm sorry
I spoke too soon. She's concerned that potentially
I guess she's concerned that potentially the plot sort of forgot for a moment that dude
She fucking is and so she accidentally forced lightnings. Did she kill chewbacca?
Yeah, yeah, so we didn't even get to the the real part
So lightning shoots from her hands destroying the transport ship and killing all its passengers. What what kill chewbacca?
What
That is what you well
That's what you're intended to think on screen. Yeah. Oh is it that he's not actually dead because yes
Oh is that was?
That's what'll happen later and no one's ever really gone
Holy fuck dude
like I came
Devastated by what she did ray collapses while all this is transpiring po fin 3po and bb8 get
OJ OJ is a ship in the air just in time to fly motherfucker a distraught ray
Wait, wait, wait, where's kylo?
I know where the fuck is kylo
I guess he's like laughing. He's like, oh he's fucking dumb bitch or or is he just he's like devastated
You killed chewbacca
I specifically told my knights of red not to hurt
He could be attached to chewbacca for all we that's what I mean. I'm like it is he's really sad about it
You guys seen that comic that robot had tweeted of like chewbacca and kylo. Yeah, i've seen that
That's so cute
At the end where he like hans he just kills han and he like is aiming at his head and then lowers it to his stomach
Yeah, that's the one yeah, I like that it's a really awesome little comic and it's trying to explain some a dub
He didn't kill kylo
Has more character to like the sequel all of the sequels
It's six panels. I'm curious
This is like people who remix the batwoman soundtrack like they have for some fucked up reason they've got more passion and care
Than those the people who actually have control of the franchise
I'm being told there are updated leaks for all of this as well in relation to the reshoots
um
Fucking hell i've been delivered a manifesto of leaps. I don't want them to change this. Okay. Yeah, look wait
So it's perfect. What we're gonna do is read these out
As if as if taking seriously and then we'll deal with whatever they actually release
So this is yeah, so f uh, well psa
Everyone who's listening this is not actually 100 nor did we expect it to be this is just a
Let's call it a skeleton that may change
Um, oh, she's skeleton
And there'll probably be a little more context to make sense of some of the more retarded stuff we hope we'll see no that won't
Um, all right. Well, yeah, so yeah, uh, no lando no foul no lando
It's not like they can't go and get him, right? He's just
Eating chicken playing basketball not worrying about his kid. So all right. Oh, no, you're right with his no
Oh, no
I would say that I would say that there I would say he's actually is worried about his kid because that's why he like
Stayed behind me. He's worried about his kid. I'm fucking do anything about it
That's how they play off. It's like oh, yeah
I I stayed here because I was so concerned that I didn't do anything
It's like I totally haven't been avoiding child support payments
No, I don't know if I'm gonna do chubaka our heroes limp away from the desert planet
So that's it for act one apparently
And this is the thing, right?
Like this may be very different when we get to the final version of this film
But this is still incredibly amusing that someone thought that any of this was a good idea
Oh, so this is act two
At least it might have more than one draft so oh, yeah, yeah, there you go
Oh, yeah, um, that's true. I guess ragzell jade you want to take this one or
Uh, i'm good. I'm not the best reader out louder. Oh, right
Because i've been listening haven't been i've been looking at it. I've just been listening a lot
Uh, because I I don't want to read ahead. I don't want spoilers even though this is one big fucking spoiler again
All right, let me roll here. So
This is where it ends
Oh, yeah, so go from act two
Uh kajimi, I guess
To is that another thingy? Yeah. Yeah another link. Yeah
Or the side of the reddit page
Is in the discord code and expanded act two
All right. Here we go boys and girls
Okey dokey, I guess I gotta click
Okay
Due to the fact that ryze the skywalker is currently going through a round of additional photography in the base
Stop from act two kajima
If you do not want to know what happens in episode nine read no farther
There anyone who missed it. Here's act one act two kajimi
We're at kajimi's house. Okay. Oh cheese wife kajimi
All right at kajimi the heroes of the resistance
Make their way to the snow dusted planet of kajimi
To execute their plan to discover what secrets the dagger held
Despite not being in possession of that dagger anymore
3po
Tells the crew that he has the message committed to memory
So all hope is not lost
Poe tracks down an old contact of his zori bliss
Oh another old contact
Yeah, another old contact. Oh, I guess that is the old contact he was talking about. Oh, yeah. Yeah
Yeah, it brings them to it. Well, no lando was a contact as well. Well, that was leah's old contact
And then there was the old con. Yeah now then there was oh ochi who is different
Oh
Lando was leah's contact zuri is
Uh pose contact
Oh and the sith are 3po's contact
Okay, uh zuri bliss who brings them to a small creature named babu frick
Babu frick
Babu fricks can never be quenched
Oh my god, what a embarrassing game
Jory brings him to a small creature named babu frick
To hack 3po's programming to read the sith language on the dagger
All right frick frick
Frick tells everyone
That he can unlock the message to be read but in doing so
C 3po's memory will be white why?
Why
Why don't they just make a copy of his memories on the usb?
And then put them in after they're done
This is dumb
Why doesn't doesn't make a babu of freaking sense
Why
This is such a forced drama to kill c3p
Dude, if if like so if they did folk kills chubaka in that scene and he's gonna come back leah
Imagine being a fabian like so chewy's dead c3p is about to be killed hod's dead
Luke is dead leah's dead irl. He doesn't even remember the old characters
He doesn't remember these people either
wiped from memory
Oh my god, doesn't remember leah doesn't remember han doesn't remember luke doesn't remember r2 d2
Well, he's I mean he's getting wiped c3po no longer exists once this is done
Yeah, c3po is dead. If you lose all your memories, you're essentially a new person
They run out of characters to ruin. Well, so like this is
This isn't like this is this isn't necessarily rude. This is just a straight-up assassinated like kill. This is like we want to move
Yeah
C3po's memories are just wiped. He's no longer c3po. He's some other robot now c4po
Well, he's gonna be the fucking psychopathic murderer c3po, isn't he?
Oh my god, please I want to see that it's gonna turn into hk47
Okay, well
Frick tells everyone that he can unlock the message to be read but in doing so c3po's memory will be wiped
Still reeling from the loss of chewbacca
The heroes argue about finding another way to get the job done
But in an act of self-sacrifice c3po voluntarily consent to the modifications. I mean that's
redundant voluntary
Knowing that for all intents and purposes the droid we've all known for years will essentially die
Okay
According to my sources this scene is reportedly one of the most emotional in the film followed by the word frick
Frick completes the hack and 3po is now able to read the message inscribed on the dagger
What if it was like a troll message from the sif like lul you thought it was like important
getting wrecked
This action creates the red-eye c3po scene in the footage
Uh, so the translated text points them to the location of the emperor's own wayfinder
Wait, so not to the emperor to the wayfinder of the emperor
the the translated text
It points them to the location of the emperor's own way find wayfinder
So it points them to the location of the thing that will point them to the location of the emperor
Yes
What the fire having served is
having served his purpose 3PO's memory wipe begins oh but why oh then it
happens okay interesting so having served his purpose 3PO's memory wipe
begins and he shuts down once the memory wipe is complete 3PO reboots with a
completely empty memory damn Star Wars fuck all you love fuck the things that
you care about fuck your old characters your old characters don't even remember
sorry fuck they want to kill him off but they also want to be able to prey it
around his corpse yeah we haven't seen that before and you know one of the big
criticisms right when this all broken you had that scene I'm just taking one
look at my friend you barely fucking know these people yeah but I would love
to there's a scene of sorry there's a scene of Chewbacca in there being like
oh he was clearly talking to Chewbacca well that is not from this scene as you
can clearly tell Chewbacca is fucking supposed to think they think he's dead
right now he's not there so that's bullshit he is talking about these new
characters as his friends that he's so worried about losing I just love the
idea that you're in the room and he says like oh my friends and you go 3PO
he's like yeah anyway what's her name pointing to red if he was like that's
that's oochie someone sent me this this little meme someone sent me that little
meme
someone's also sent me this
oh god oh it's the McMuffin mr. McMuffin very good
yeah that's part of that meme is the handwritten yum that really sells it
that really I've been wrote that well drunk I've actually been collecting a
lot of neat memes we'll have a section for that as soon as we get through all
this for sure oh my but yeah there's been some good shit
I'm not gonna lie anyway where are we while on Kijimi Kyle Kylo you go get
Kyle Ben sorry sorry sorry I didn't mean to do that I apologize while on Kijimi
Kylo initiates another mind bond with Ray to try and define her location a
second time you know I have like those fucking like those hip-hop necklaces
with the like the time on them she's like she's wearing one that has her
location just at all times yeah I just like that did he pops it she looks
normal he's like so did you pick up anything around you just do it a day you
won't wait a second you're at Kijimi these snowflakes I remember these
snowflakes from my child they're the exact same snow that fell when fucking
something water cycle I'll do it just keep it keep reading do this and lol
coming up I think okay so I think we're gonna have some cool lore all right while
on Kijimi Kylo initiates another mind bond with Ray to try and divine her
location a second time why he isn't abusing the fuck out of this I don't
know Kylo spends much of this time antagonizing Ray some of this
conversation revolves around her parents and the truth behind the dagger it was
once used to murder her parents okay cool it was once used to murder her
parents many years ago ochi was sent to murder Ray's parents who were trying to
hide Ray from the galaxy from the galaxy oh she succeeded leaving her
parents as nobody's to be forgotten by that galaxy where ochi was with Ray he
could not find her so he left her behind on Jack wait so he knew she was on
Jakku but he couldn't find her on this we just gave up I guess I think that's
probably just a bad writing by whoever like wrote the leaks okay this is what
Ray remembers the ship leaving in the wake of her parents murder not her
parents abandoning her Ray lashes out at Kylo during this blonde and their
lightsabers clash okay so we're doing we're doing the Captain Marvel
simulation thing now huh they don't even have to wait whoa whoa whoa he finds out
the location from that it says having gotten everything he needed from her
doing that session he cuts off the bond what did you find out where she was how
he saw the gun he's like I know that mountain okay okay hang on okay so Kylo
taunts Ray by telling her that parents what weren't actually like didn't
actually just sell her for drinking money and actually they were like trying
to hide her cuz she's really important and they were murdered in the process
wouldn't she like hearing that well well they were dead anyway she told her
that they died or whatever they did just if you're drinking money in the room she
knew they weren't around surely the best reason for that is like not that they
abandoned her but they died like that's got to be something at least I guess
she's angry at him cuz he lied is that is that as well why would you even
believe I was about to say why would you even believe him this time though maybe
she has confirmation cuz the fucking dagger gave him memories she's mad that
he keeps sneaking face while she's on the shitter I would imagine that might
maybe that's why she's so upset he just likes to watch girls shit he doesn't
like to actually watch the shitting just watch her as she shit like the it's
implied likes the palpy tells Palpatine this he wants a solution to a public
like I'm not prepared to deal with this you're not using this ability to this
full estate should see him as well so she's just like whatever she's taking a
shit she sometimes just looks up and sees Kylo just like sitting there and
like oh but she's gonna hope he's just sitting there yeah but but Kylo like
pretends to live here it's like doing something else well we'll just like
silence for a few minutes that he just goes like does it hurt oh he was force
Walker reminiscent of that screen scene in the force awakens where they're doing
the force battle in the beginning the force awakens where he's trying to get
in her mind and they're both pooping but they're both straining the same way
like close-ups close-ups it on their faces they do the force battle they did
for the lights and for Kylo's dick they're both pulling on his cock she's
pushing on his cock he's trying to get it out she's trying to put it away so
it was just that he would say like wait don't flush it yet this turn is one of
the most massive I've ever seen in the galaxy we need the turd for the dyad oh
my goodness what is what has become of us that's why he puts the mass back on
the we are the man this is this is what happens when you have an alt-right
leftist stream that's what this is all right like all alt W R I T E all left no
all leftists right am I right right right all leftists right yeah it says though
it's just a star destroyers arrive are they the the super duper planet
destroying ones is super super star destroyers from what I understand they
need children to crew those all right Timmy now ease it right into position
yeah now let it go away wouldn't that be the best thing you see these things
finally take up children fucking ran into each other and stuffing they're all
crude by small children you couldn't go to easily be the parody movie for their
heads oh my god all of this would easily be at a parody movie it'd be great
as well I would love my fucking ass off it was so good like Ray tries to help
Chewbacca and she obliterates them with fucking sorry man they're looking for
something are they just the ground caves away below them they're like oh there it
is yeah at the very end cuts a black next scene I can only read this if you
kill me I really don't keep they said because I want to talk about that for a
while the idea that the only way he could read it is if he also disappears
like he's deleted you're like that doesn't that doesn't translate at all the
fact that they're like he has read it now he shall be deleted you're like no
stop don't do that like no no yeah okay let's program a protocol to translate
languages right okay you should have the ability to translate this language but
he shouldn't be allowed to do that no it's gonna it's gonna code it and so he
can do it but he can't he can't actually say like I'm picturing make the pro
let's code in the ability and then forbid him from doing yeah he can like
he can understand the n-word he can read it he just can't say it aloud and his
penance for saying the n-word aloud is that to have his memory wiped or George
just ask him what they should do on like don't don't get into translators just
be like okay so what should we do sit with the information like what's what
should our next course of action be work I'm lost why did they even need the
dagger what was there what were they hoping to achieve with it Lando said the
dagger does know he said to go find uchi right ouchy no no they were looking for
the dagger I thought were they looking at the dagger I think yeah before they
found it true okay because it leads to the way finder that's generally if C3PO
can't translate it what okay okay just take us to where it tells us to go have
they found that out without translating it he knows what it says he just can't
tell them can you write it down yeah why don't yeah that's a good point well
they just go okay don't tell us what it says just just point points on a map
point on a map where the thing is just you do it see that's so stupid I can
read it but I can't tell you what it says it's so JJ play these games with us
it's so J and if you said to JJ any of this stuff you just be smiling the whole
time you'd be like can't do that no it doesn't work that way it doesn't work
that way because any of this makes sense and he's like well if you do it
that way then you won't have the emotional moment when C3PO dies he's a
talent black hole like he has like the what is the opposite of talent like like
not not just like an absence of talent he has he has anti-talent anti-talent
everything around him is become just becomes incompetent what is Anthony
was a great director before he met JJ according to Google the two words that
are opposite to talent are inability and clumsiness that about sums up JJ he's
charger he has the inability that's that's his that's his skill it needs to
be exiled for his clumsiness it's coming full circle all right where will
we all right here we go pop pop pop oh yeah the star destroyers arrive on
Kojimi yeah after having followed our heroes there as Kylo makes his wait
sorry skip some parts right no no it's just that no I thought I thought he got
the location from his skype call not that it just said they followed the
heroes there well I thought that it was implying that the first order followed
their group as they escaped or something I don't know which by the way why can't
they do that with the hyperspace dragon yeah god that's gonna present an issue
in every single Star Wars story set after the Last Jedi stop thinking about
it no you your thoughts are causing problems my thoughts army of thoughts
how could your army thought army that's what multiple thinkings is it's a thought
army so anyway yeah it's okay if I take a god oh yeah so star destroyers arrive
on Kojimi after having followed her heroes I guess they just waited for him
I don't know as Kylo makes his way down to the planet Zori helps the resistance
escape by employing the use of something there's gonna be another
MacGuffin I bet by employing the use of something described to me as a first
order passage device something that transmits a signal recognized as
friendly to the first order allowing the ship to bullshit okay just fine sure
sure no yeah it makes no sense hey there's hey how come there's one
ship coming away from the planet towards us well it says it's friendly so
I guess we're just gonna fucking let it do that whatever but it's clearly not
our ship we have windows we can look out and see it no it doesn't count that's
not it we'll have to see the context for this but I'm calling well what's the
point in calling bullshit the whole thing is you know as our heroes make
their escape we say I've seen as happens a lot as our heroes make their escape we
see that Palpatine's orders to Hux and pride are being carried out as children
are being rounded up by soldiers of the first order I'm just glad that these
children finally fucking have a chance at a future Jesus all right first and
also are at this point do you not have like planets under your control that you
can just like enlist people from like don't fucking tell me or remember the
supremacy has millions of people on it are those all kidnapped children it's
literally an army of kidnapped children the first order reigns supreme I don't
guess I think it's maybe because Palpatine's fleet is so fucking big I
don't know why they're taking kids that is that makes sense I guess you can
control them I just like the Empire had an army they enlisted people like from
planets and stuff coming yeah be part of the Empire you get like money and you
can go up in the ranks and you could have a future for yourself and you know
it's come all that army army stuff that people get from being in the army you
know like there was a reason clones have got to be better than kids you can
accelerate their growth you can you can program them to obey your orders yeah
it's to the first order would prefer to run around in a white van and round
everyone up to it accelerated growth but it's only mental growth their bodies are
still it's basically like having an army of midgets no large midgets oh no
problem an army of free time they're off mentally they're all six years old at
least they at least they're the ones that can enjoy rags needs this seed just
a whole army of when you see a planet just press this button this button not
got this god damn it Billy what color is red no no that's blue oh my goodness
what the fuck's happening watching their friends die oh this is gonna be worse
than the Last Jedi and then there's a bunch of rooms possible it's like like
kindergarten play rooms all over the supremacy and the Star Destroyers with
like puzzle mats and pegs and I don't know in 64 you just see one of them one
of them about to get one of those like mobile type things with the they spin
the little things of dangling down he's like they're literally they're
literally playing t-ball oh my goodness I'm my throat hurts okay think chat chat
do you think this could be worse than the Last Jedi yes or no goodness yeah just
do yes I think yeah there's a good chance look how intensely complicated the
plot is we're not even halfway through the fucking plot this is a tangled
fucking web of nonsense and oochies I mean TLJ was downright simplistic
compared to this a lot of shit happens in this one like a lot of shit like this
is crazy and I mean we do have you know like do caucus you know you know had some
reports that he had rumors that 75% of this movie was redone you know yeah well
so this is the thing everything we've read today might actually just not even
be a thing because of how desperately they're trying to fix it all I know it'll
probably be even worse you don't even you know be safe bad instead of like
stupid ridiculous bad yeah she and the McMuffins are cannon I don't give a fuck
what anybody says imagine if we get there we're all interested this is the
only give up on this thing and he doesn't show up and we'd be pissed we
need this anyway all right all right so Oh Kijimi back on the surface of the
planet Kijimi and having grown tired of a fruitless search for a way to initiate
have you jumped over the or did you read all the previous one oh no I have Oh
first-order stardestroyer above kijimi escape on ochi ship the group makes the
decision to use the passage device to board the star destroyer and recapture
the Falcon right the device works as advertised and their ship lands without
question but they're on ochi ship the ship lands without question we I really
need to before I can really not a fully judge this I really need to see the
context always I don't know exactly what their device is apparently able to just
make them look like a good guy to the first order right it's basically their
transponder signal is what it sounds so the friend or full identification
broadcast like yeah signal or a rebellion I need to see what they
actually specifically do but like what rags already brought up the whole like
oh there's one ship heading toward us it's one of ours okay like there's gonna
be it depends on what they do look at it it's clearly not a first-order ship
maybe they can't see it they can only scan it and if they be they surely did
hail it be like uh who are y'all unless ochi was allied with the first order
contact in the first order did it well and you also remember back in return to
the Jedi when they had a guddle they still needed codes you know for
authorization so obviously it's where it's a long time removed from that so
it could have changed yeah I would look at from you know established war they
don't need to look like a ship from the first order because remember the first
order is an army of adult children Oh man babies okay all right
the device works as advertised in their ship lands without question on board the
Star Destroyer the droids log onto the ship's computer network I guess they
just let them walk around oh okay the droids log on to the ship's computer
network to locate the Falcon but in the process they discover that Chewbacca is
still alive oh okay he was on a different one the whole time he was on
a different one they just didn't notice he was on a different one or two yeah
the team hatches out is fucking stupid yeah yeah the team hatches a plan for a
rescue mission but Ray splits off feeling as if something is calling to
her meanwhile the others find Chewie but the rescue attempt fails and they are
all taken captive all right okay the calling Ray feels is caused by the
dagger which draws her to it in Kylo's living quarters oh about you going well
hello poops with the door open dagger oh my good I like how not Kylo isn't the
calling it's the dagger this fucking piece of sharpened metal all right so
Kijimi oh Kylo's not here oh yeah that's right Kylo isn't here it's the
fucking dagger doing it right back on the surface of what if it's like Kylo's
toilet or something like all I have to shit here the catharsis this will bring
me it's these no I hate Kylo I was here I I shat in your toilet and I flushed it
I didn't even leave it for you Ray finds Kylo's toilet that's just wired up with
loads of hidden cameras he likes to watch it so
Kylo why are you so weird people back as he can and then feed them loads of food
and be like oh no don't leave you don't leave yet I've got a bathroom here you can use this
he tricks people into using his bathroom 99.9% of the time it's just random
stormtroopers walking up and down the hallway you look busy you need to take
shit you need to stop it from it it's really easy to convince them because they
all have a total state of a six year old so they're like yeah sure mister I'll go poop in your house
hey you have to take a seat oh he died
they never indoctrinated him to not talk to strangers
I got some free candy in my bathroom
if you shit it out in my bathroom kind of weird dude
I'm getting a dream that I will for the movie with utmost confidence oh okay
alright okay so back on the surface of the planet and having grown tired of a
fruitless search for a Kylo initiates another force bond with her so you can
just do that then whenever he whenever all right it's literally it's literally a
cell phone plan oh no I just bought end or down there we're going to end or at
some point right he discovers that she is on his star destroyer in and and a
lightsaber duel breaks out between the two of them across two different
locations okay they're fighting each other well-being in different locations
now yeah man from the trailer where they destroy something random while fighting
yeah but how does that how does that how how how how is it just arguing
neighbors used to be melee weapons is it just apparently you just argue with them
the bond got that strong that just every can you just grab her and pull her
into his fucking no man this sounds weird as hell yeah yeah like there's no
way the landscapes light up completely there's gotta be some kind of fuck up
grab her and just give her a fucking swirly oh I'm already picturing some
kind of crazy CGI insanity with this that they put like see JJ's just like
have like a fucking animal like charge towards ray and her wheel then she
grabs kylo jumps into his temporarily then jumps back you know like some kind
of goofy shit I don't know it's like it's like kind of like dr. strange in
the yeah yeah yeah and that's the thing this all of this if they're doing it
like this it just it makes everything that's written after that and before it
you kind of just makes you question what the hell is actually going on what are
the rules what are the stakes well that's the fucking problem with this
trilogy I'm picturing like if he explained this to Palpatine like Kylo
he's like oh yeah I have these like this connection he's like how did that
happen it's like Snoke did it it's like Snoke did what exactly it's like he
connected us how what do you mean like he put our brains together like I don't
think we can and like you tell Palpatine just this deadpan face look at him like
this doesn't make any sense dude are you sure you're not imagining all this he's
like no it's definitely real in our brains he talks to Ray in person about
all this and she's like literally I've never what do you mean I don't know what
you're talking about none of this never happened he's like Oh liar of course you
would say that you're a Jedi okay all right
Kylo on the surface of Kijimi and Rey aboard Star Destroyer their fucking
force lightning fight lightsaber fighting and their fucking visions all
right during this encounter Kylo reveals that there is more to the story
behind Rey and her parents oh boy okay Rey is the granddaughter of Emperor
Palpatine so did Palpatine just reveal that to her how does Kylo know this one
of her parents one of her parents then was the Emperor's son or daughter I
guess they don't okay all right that must have been interesting oh yeah I'd be
more curious about that character than I am about anybody in the sequel trilogy
like what was it like to have Palpatine as a parent and what was it like post
his explosion well no what I'm saying is like we were you in the position we
got to like hide yourself from people you're like oh I'm not a Palpatine one
I'm not related to that guy no because I guess bad I mean like if this if this
trilogy gave a shit about world building then you would want to hide the fuck you
know away from the galaxy from people finding out you were the son of the evil
Emperor Palpatine you would want nobody there people would there'd probably be
assassins after you all the time bounty hunters unless nobody knew I guess
nobody would know probably kept a secret of something was probably just let you
know fucking a lot he was a player he had oh yeah that's why they called him
creepy she he had a button in the throne room like the pleasure barge and
Ragnarok it's like it's like quagmire's couch
okay all right we gotta focus very serious work we're doing today okay this
is this is important all right what are you gonna raise raise the granddaughter
of ever seen of course he tells her that they are meant to join together on the
dark side and that it's all part of the Emperor's plan it's clear that it's
clear that by this point in the story Kylo is fully committed to what the
Emperor's mission for him is once Ray and Kylo's force bond dual and fuck
Kylo makes his way back to his ship and Ray grabs the dagger and Chewbacca's
bandolier and bolts what how does she get oh she's oh no she she she grabs
Chewbacca's bandolier and then bolts is and she leaves not also his balls she
grabs his bolts like actually shoot bolts she how did she find these
fuck is naked oh my goodness yeah how did she find those specific things was
she just told where they are she's right yeah she had she said something polar to
that room oh yeah it smells like smells like wet dog in there let me
invest a pleasant Wookiee musk all right finally all right once Ray blah blah
Chewbacca's bandolier and she bolts all right Ray bumps into a fresh-minded C3
P.O. along the way okay okay just walking around all right hands him
Chewbacca's effects and the dagger and tells him to make a run for it
something at see through P.O. is good at by the way hands them the stuff tells
she feel to run for it while she stalls Kylo it's the second time that she's
done that and the first one she she sent them right she sent them to the ship to
be like I'll hold them off the same fucking thing again I guess when it
appears that all is lost for our heroes that have been captured by the first
order general Hux arrives and surprisingly not only allows escape but
points them in the direction of the Falcon Hux was a bowl within the first
order that Finn and Poe had received information from course I hope this is
right because if so that means that I was correct no it doesn't you've got
stiff competition my good man this is not over where's where's Finn even been
this whole time being a mole is actually a pretty consistent leak for a while no
well like I'm sure he will be the the thingy I'm curious how they're gonna
argue it right because if they say he's recently turned that's much more less
egregious than he was always a part of the resistance I don't think they're
gonna try to explain I think they're just gonna try to make it happen they're
clearly not worried about explaining any fucking thing in these movies even so
even if that is the case as they walk by and they're gonna be like what the fuck
you doing around about these kids motherfucker he's still actively
rounding up children for Palpatine's army and he'll be like oh fuck off it's
that's I didn't do anything that didn't John boy I guess say that like Finn gets
some stuff to do in this film like where's he been just following people
around again my character he gets to do things yay me this is what it feels like
to be a protagonist I run places with other people yeah it's great we did it
hooray all this vanity okay so that stuff Hux was the mole within the first order
that Finn and Poe had received information from Ray and the other
heroes make a break for the Falcon and escape after they leave Kylo kills Hux
for treason against the first order Wow really just just like that from this
point forward general pride is the sole commander of the first military we got a
new person the new person's why even bother with this like new person's in
charge so dumb the Emperor contacts pride in demands that he uses one of the
specially equipped star destroyers to destroy Kijimi as an act of loyalty and
pride complies Kijimi is destroyed okay bye Kijimi we get to blow up a planet
speaking of blowing a planet Endor the information gleaned from C-3PO's
translation of the daggers reading that's not a phrase he'd expect here in
Star Wars here we are leads the location of a second wayfinder device to be aboard
the wreckage of the second Death Star on the forest moon of Endor that's not how
that works we've all been over this you don't get to have wreckage of that
Death Star sorry it's good blow just loaded also any of the parts that were
left like Endor's fucking like the pieces of that thing are gonna rain down
on in like it's actually terrible don't think about it it just evaporated from
the explosion that's so much better than the chunks and pieces landing on
whatever whatever man it's fine it's great but Endor has low gravity so the
chunks can no no chunks landed on the side of a mountain and they just slid
nicely they landed in the ocean yeah now that we've seen the fucking pictures
right of the enormous chunk that it is it's not like it's it's not like it's a ship
size or something it's like a third of it it looks like it's it's got the big disk part
in it the little the big gun fire ray thing firing disk yeah thing all right um i guess
the explosion just wasn't quite as explosiony as we remember it didn't even kill the people on board
uh our memory must have been failing us clearly this is the mandela effect
all right they re-released the original trilogy with loads of changes so this stuff makes sense
it explodes there's no real fire it just splits into three really bad pngs that float away and
that you just see the abbro going like oh it's like haley's colonial marines when the
ship blows up and it clips through your ship yeah oh that way i'd be okay if we got those
all those changes to make this make so long as we got the mclunky with every single one just like
we got for Greedo that would be okay oh that Greedo stuff that you're opening up a whole
another can of worms there so yeah so along their way to the wreckage the crew comes in contact with
a person named jana it is revealed that she was press ganged into first order service as a child
but eventually escapes and found her way to end or where she has been living for some time uh
ten bucks says she's an insane badass uh i want to know what press i don't know what press ganged
means um like forced i guess yeah uh let's see at this time it is revealed that she is the child
that lando lost to the first okay cool cool man uh jana provides ray with transportation to get
to the death star wreckage still seems pretty fucking convenient to have bumped into here
wow we just ran into lando's daughter on indoor where she is all right all right it's a small
galaxy guys yeah i guess it is like a couple meters the galaxy yeah it's just 12 people in it
okay ray makes her way to the death star wreckage and begins climbing her way through its twisted
remains it's possessive that does not have the posture one of my sources told me that this
scene feels very reminiscent of the activities we see ray doing when we are first introduced to
her in tfa she eventually reaches the emperor's throne room and discovers a chamber connecting
to that room that contains the second way finder ray approaches the object and picks it up
which induces visions of a possible future for herself in this vision we see a version of ray
that has been enveloped by the dark side has seen in the footage before so not a shot which is like
imagine putting that in the fucking truck
my my sources have also told me that the voice of palpatine may be heard during this scene
the vision shocks ray and she stumbles back into the throne room where kylo ran is waiting for
okay kylo takes possession of the emperor's wayfinder destroys it and indicates to ray that
the only way to get another wayfinder is to go through him and take vaders vaders got a wayfinder
yay um no i need to we need to stop a second okay so she came to this place to get the wayfinder
why are the two wayfinders what am i confused why are the two wayfinders one of them is
palpatines and one of them is vaders i don't i don't really know what what does it help anything
i i know but that's so i don't understand it well no there's one but there there's there's
one more but there there are now there's the wayfinders just call this let's just call this
episode nine the revenge of the wayfinders yep i guess maybe the wayfinder leads you to this
random where this square is floating in the middle of nowhere they're seeing yeah hideout right
look at video game that's what this is this is a video game yay this is this is so stupid
what is the over and under that you guys think this is actually going to be reminiscent of what we get
well this is the thing right like as much as do you think these leaks are they will be reshoots
sure fine and they'll shift everything around sure fine but some of this is making it in
eighty percent and all of it is garbage so we're getting there's nothing redeemable about any of
this yeah and imagine imagine being told okay we have to we have some reshoot time you know we can
we can change a few things how the fuck do you fix this with by reshooting some scenes
well again that's the thing though is it's no matter what you did with this movie it was not
going to be good um i don't it's like i uh it's like i said a while back what someone told me it
doesn't matter if the force awakens would have been a good setup and it doesn't matter if the rise
of skywalker would have been a good ending you still got a piece of shit in the middle of your
sandwich so when you bite into it still a shit sandwich so nothing they do with this movie was
going to be good but now it looks like they're just chasing their own yeah i have a series all
type of shit into this the series does feel it does feel light it feels it feels like
shit scraped over too much bread i mean with the whole shit sandwich analogy it's like well what
this this piece of bread is damp with shit like it this is it was pissed upon before the shit was
applied and people like oh look at that shit the bill of sandwich like i think we should be
concerned about all the pieces at this point some of the crust is salvageable don't worry
you know the smell could be better but it's not all a shitty pissy mess
that should be the quote they put in the trailer of the film it's not all a shitty pissy mess
yeah not all a shitty pissy mess look at that theme look at that shot look at those colors
look the falcon you're like no notice just see how the the yellow and the brown mixed together
with how much of a disaster this film is by the way there will be video essayists
doing videos about how these amazing themes in this film is going to be somebody oh yeah
oh yeah the theme is going to be taught like probably like at least 50 of the people who
loves the old they're going to have to convince themselves that their fucking stupid retarded
take from the last jedi was actually wrong and now this new stupid retarded take is the right one
like they're gonna have to try people are gonna have to try and convince themselves that
their vehement impassioned defense of the last jedi that turd was actually wrong and they're
gonna have like a crisis of the mind well i mean if that was happening wouldn't they just conclude
that jj ruined everything who knows they're gonna like both they're gonna they're gonna like
look at all kinds of there'll be people out there who love all three of them people who hate all
three of them people who prefer tfa to the other two and all the other combinations she
she means people who are right correct me correct me um quick note before we get back to it uh
every frame of applause is 6.5 on amdb now yay damn it yeah we we're we're we're losing
against geeks and gamers a bunch of i can't believe a bunch of incel right wingers
went there and brigaded it with positive reviews oh man it's those russian bots yeah you guys
better not fucking go to efap on imdb and give it good ratings that would be fucking
wrong that would be gaming the system it would be unprincipled that would not be an epic gamer
moment that would be that would be bad geeks and gamers has improved to 2.7 and i don't really
appreciate that they're from 2.3 to 3.4 we were at 2.7 now we're 3.4 motherfuckers how dare you
almost as high as efap was yay appreciate that should we continue we shall should we all right
we shall here we go ladies and gentlemen are we doing this uh that's that's uh
uh the vision shocks you kylo uh kylo takes possession of the emperor's wayfinder destroys
it and indicates to ray that the only way to get another way through him and take vader
uh i guess that's something he's just carried around with him you know a lightsaber battle
ensues beginning in the throne room and eventually transitioning to exterior wreckage among the
crashing waves like the trailer yep looks like we're at the third act again like we've got
we thought the movie was going to be done after the we thought the first act was like the whole
film yeah like so much happens and we're like oh okay this will be it nope all right okay so we
go to now the resistances jungle base all right off in another part of the galaxy off in a different
uh a different what yeah off in another part of the galaxy while kylo and ray flash savers
a bright light in the universe begins to fade leia is dying what just random way why
she was hit by a death star explosion 30 years ago
it's gonna be death sticks the cocaine death sticks
i look i can't i'm sorry i just i feel like there'll be something in the movie i'm sure of
it right there'll be something to explain like oh like she didn't just cut to layer she's like
i'm dying what needs to be it and it's just they couldn't find those two words next to each other
so again clipped it's just like i'm dying it's like the i'm is the old layer and the dying is
the young layer i'm dying oh um somebody um somebody has messaged me saying skywalker means
wayfinder uh sorry to message but i remembered that in the canon books throns species the word
for wayfinder is skywalker okay that's disgusting all right well i'm dying that's a poop sandwich
also someone has sent me this meme i would like to express my enjoyment of this meme
saying the n-word is like my favorite new meme
uh someone has someone has sent me this meme stop sending him memes i'm supposed to collect them
and show them all later now you're gonna fucking show them also gonna alter all my fucking memes
it's a piece of shit you don't have to show these on the stream what the fuck am i gonna do having
all of you laugh at something they can't see you fucking idiot that'd be rude that's the stream this
stream has been us laughing at things we can't see what are you what are you the fuck are you
talking about we can literally see what's on screen right the leaks are right there
so they have no context for these ones there we go
uh it looks like um it looks like uh disney stole a fan's tie design and named
a name for the rise of skywalker the tie dagger so they stole a dagger yeah i don't know i i
saw that uh there's a video about that like um they stole a tie design yeah they're basically
some guys like little fan fakie designed some some tie um i don't know what he called it
oh yeah i'm sure it is um and he was pretty fair he was like to be fair
like all ties kind of share similar stuff they have these certain angular wings but
yeah it does look a lot like it
please show us what's making me
so
jesus
what the hell kyle
why didn't you i don't even know does it hurt
oh my god it's beautiful ah okay and um then and someone someone and uh someone send that one too
oh goodness gracious
there we go
all right
show the meme again nope so no you're not sure names no can't show me gotta save for later
uh where are we on our leaks let me see oh yes uh uh leah is dying leah is dying everybody leah
is dying uh uh before her death we hear the voice of a familiar hero come to bid her farewell and
pass on one last bit of knowledge okay hopefully i guess they're referring to uh mace windu i guess
i don't know so i would imagine that'd be luke right yeah i think it's gonna be luke i think
it's gonna be luke coming back and be like hey just you know if you want to talk well after
the afterlife this is how you do it that's what i think it'll be we get lightning
though who fucking knows wait isn't he in this supposedly who fucking knows we'll just we'll
have to move on who knows hi hi it's kylo he's a daughter to watch your shit
all right so on indoor as their battle rages on both kylo and ray since the death of their
respective mother and mentor they both react but ray recovers from the shock sooner
which makes sense because wow that doesn't make sense that is so dark side that's but kylo's
the dark side of course he would recover sooner yeah why should he care didn't he try to kill her
if anything the light side people are does she get a cheap shot at him while he's grieving for
his mother you bet she recovers from the shock sooner and leverages the moment to take kylo's
weapon from him and stab him through the chest with it what oh take that they take that wow
that's what you get for caring imagine luke doing that in the ot like darth vader finds out his mom
is dying so it's like man got you down bitch you're dying parent fucker what a pussy yeah
in the aftermath of their concluded duel ray declares to kylo that she will never be like him
what do you mean you just killed someone while they're grieving for their mom
um uh she exercises her newfound healing ability oh my god steals his ship along with vader's
wayfinder device aboard it and takes off leaving her in any fucking dick fatal blows
no it's just a chest stab with lightsaber that's never killed anyone honestly can she just heal
anyone like with any wound she can heal a worm she can heal kylo you're dead jk bye wow just wow
those vet veterinary animal planet shows where they go around healing farm animals that's just
what she becomes after this she just goes around the galaxy healing all the race horses and sand
worms and shit healing your butthole after reministered this script is intensely bad dude
okay as uh after ray leaves the forest moon the remainder of the resistance crew boards the falcon
along with their newfound found ally jana having spent the duration of ray and kylo's fight
repairing the ship so did she never go to lando because she knew that lando was is fin in this
film he's in the background he he's in the background frowning constantly at c3p over
he's still here because there's a shot in the trailer of when he deaths wreckage like while
they're having the fight i'm pretty sure he is saying death star wreckage yeah and he's running
because he does he runs and screams ray which is just what he does um so he's definitely there
anyway uh uh having spent the duration of ray and kylo's fight repairing the ship and returning
to the hidden base on the jungle planet broken and defeated remember how it took mandalorian
and his amazing mechanic friend like days to fix their ship well that was different i don't
because i didn't see it okay uh broken and defeated kylo ren remains on the wreckage of
the second death star when he is visited by a vision of his father
hon speaks to his son telling him that it's never too late to return
to the light and make the right choice
please let this happen please let this happen please let this be real please let this be real
force this might be the greatest moment ever magic on solo this conversation has a profound
effect on kylo and in a symbolic gesture he discards his lightsaber and walks away from
darkness and the identity of kylo ren oh so that's all it took that's all it took is like
guy shows up to this hey stop it and then he's like okay i should be like a try from hon i was
like hon i killed you i don't it's no all it took was a pep talk from hon solo old hon solo and
yeah kylo's a good kylo's a good man he's gonna be evil again kylo is a good man
this is see i still i still think kylo's that's why we disqualified him kylo is so inconsistent
it's insane his character is inconsistency so we're doing this again now hey guys would
it be better if if the force ghost hon solo was alton aran reich and not harrison ford
they could bring that that's what i'm hoping for oh my god boom i just dropped the bomb on you
right there it's going to be force ghost alton aran reich just blew up your star destroyer
knowledge i will come greatest moment ever right here if you imagine that if it is that with
everything else that's happened in this tisby film eventually audience members will just be like
they're just little tongues out of their mouth drooling with like they're just like i can't take
too much bad i can't do it i want that i want that to happen so bad you know harrison ford
probably charged fucking 20 million dollars because he does no interest so i gotta be funny
but this is just let us remember for a second this is fucking if they try to make this like a
force ghost force ghost normie hon solo you can't that doesn't make any fucking sense he's like he's
confused he doesn't know what the fuck's happening he doesn't know where he is he's like i thought i
fucking got out of this i'm sorry how is hana force ghost anyway doesn't that like that's what
i'm saying yeah was it was the incident you never did no force shit you don't have to to be force
sensitive you could just everyone's force sensitive and we're really doing this again a force ghost
shows up and just undoes like years upon years of being fucking shit like yo shame you didn't talk
to kylo like that's what hon says to kylo the rate of teacher failure is he does the other
things as well and you know the last literally a couple paragraphs ago we just read about how
committed kylo was to the emperor plan and all it takes is his ass beat and then healed his ass beat
again and then healed and for hon to say hey fuck up kiddo and he's sometimes you just gotta stab
someone so that they see things your way i mean that's that's the theme of the film i just i love
how much of a pompous ass ray's gonna come off in that scene it's like i could kill you but i'm not
gonna i'm not gonna i'm not gonna grieving man the top comment on this is kylo and ray fight
three times in this second act alone and then someone says well i guess jj wanted the lightsaber
battles to end for once and it looks as though he doesn't win a single one of them
yeah no well dude there's so many questions but i guess we'll have to kick on because
a lot of this is missing due to the fact that it's not even all confirmed but um right um
um also if if hon solo okay so leah is dead she is freshly dead and so and so like once leah dies
this happens leah's body's still warm probably from the cocaine and so hon is the one who comes
to her in a force vision not leah who just died yeah no it makes no weird leah never gets to see
her son well no they could have been leah because she wouldn't be able to uh dead yeah i know that
she is dead now that's why he got fucking stabbed no but as in that's why it would have been her
but they couldn't get her in to read the lines because well they've gotten her to do all this
shit yeah well they had they had they had all of the things that allowed her to do all of these
things okay well that's what they did have because if if it's true and they've not reanimated her
then apparently that's what they had is this is your argument right now like oh they did
the mouse hasn't reanimated fucking dead carry this shirt to serve his bidding in the afterlife
as an undead thrall if they are claiming to if we believe that they are only using unused footage
then yes that doesn't mean they don't they don't have that doesn't mean they can't use made up audio
by some other actress yeah they could have done it if they wanted to it's weird that they didn't
i actually think that would have made more sense it's an entirely like uh the fault we only see the
force goes from behind it's gonna take 60 years of cigarettes and heroin to be able to replicate
fisher's voice they're gonna need damn good actors i'm sure you could find one on the street
that the guy at mauler the guy was telling you the guy that made the video about me
and he was going after anna and a few other people he deleted his twitter account now
well he only created it to harass us yeah he only created it just a few days ago to harass us
and now he's already deleted it so typical dlj fans for you right there wow hey kill the past
delete your twitter account if you have to
are we kicking on with part three let's fucking do it only if alden erin reich's
han solo force ghost shows up that's my new thing now i'm dropping the scott stapp movement
but leah's still like old leah not old good-looking carrie fisher yes that's what's so awesome about
what the fuck how how that's what's so great about it i mean you just press f12 he gets
like custom character and force ghost for hard is with kira like that's his true love and leah's
like wow i do not see the dice the dice are a thing i told luke i told luke to give you the
dice to tell you that i don't love you i love her someone says it's not over oh no it's just
oh no no no no like two it's this is free time we're ready for this it's almost like a whole
trilogy and and this one is fucked so it's gonna take a while this is ryan is this is this the one
where it ends with ray saying a certain thing yes n-word oh my god to the end of this motherfucker
may the n-word be with you all right uh powerful nigger dream so back to octu following her
experience on the death star ray returns to the island on octu so this is the the stupid tism
island that luke was on in tlj right poor poor girl throughout the course of the film she is
given into her aggression okay who ray apparently when stab kylo she she used force lightning yeah
okay yeah fine fine fine whatever uh nearly killed her friend by unleashing a stream of lightning on
a ship learned that she is the descendant of a sith lord who reduced the jedi to numbers that
they have yet to recover from even half a century later saw a vision of herself as a servant of
darkness and stabbed her enemy through the chest in anger i mean she still healed him yeah she
healed them also they it's they were fighting lightsabers they were fighting is this actually
like hearth heard through line of thoughts who's she talking to and expressing this well i don't
know or is this just a commentary yeah okay uh her most recent encounter with kylo was the last
straw and ray has now made the decision to follow the example set by luke and exile herself on the
island where the jedi began okay what what really what i don't know man like that's don't we have
other things to do fist like emperor the first order all of your fucking friends also is that not
that's not actually luke's example because at the end of tlj he totally isn't doing that so uh okay
all of that is the movie says yeah he was wrong to do that it's weird ray scuttles the ship she
stole from kylo and throws the repaired lightsaber originally constructed by anakin skywalker in it
why does everyone keep disrespecting this lightsaber what is wrong with you people
i hate it more than you oh what is this a ghostly hand a ghostly hand snatches the
lightsaber out of thin air as it's being thrown it's luke skywalker luke's conversation with ray
is said to be encouraging yet realistically grim in tone what is what's realistically grim
like the leaker doesn't really have details i guess yes that's just what he's been told
maybe he's gonna say something like you know a lot of good people have been horribly murdered
and assassinated in a character way so you know you not got much to work with but you can still try
i can just imagine he catches it and then she turns around he's got a glass of green milk hey
but i guess we've kind of glanced over the fact he caught a lightsaber as a force ghost that's
interesting with what yoda did right with yeah yoda did with the sticks so even that was like
getting something else to do something for him well no no no he wasn't actually like he hit luke
oh yes hit him with sticks yeah yeah but he he just uh luke says to ray don't worry ray all
the other characters have been assassinated but you're safe you never really had a character to
begin with she's like oh my goodness that pushes it so uh luke knows firsthand what it's like to
face palpatine and that's not an easy task ray must confront palpatine in the same way that luke
once had to confront vader what what try and convince palpatine to be a good guy that's gonna
work out i can't believe it if that is that what they're trying to do i guess we'll read on uh
luke encourages ray by telling her of the faith layer had in her she saw the potential within
her and hoped that ray would be able to restore the balance to the force once more just as anakin
once did anakin didn't really as evidenced by this film he didn't really he didn't really do a good
job did he he sort of anakin kind of fucked it up actually hey that force is balanced for you know
a couple weeks uh you know it's balanced for as long as palpatine doesn't show up or do anything
that's yeah that's pal is here yeah exactly because he didn't fucking kill him so where's
the balance it would be so awkward if luke said that and then she's like anakin didn't really do
that and luke's like okay well you know subjective really what it means to balance she's like no
objectively he didn't find out that palpatine is still alive i guess he knows he doesn't seem to
give a shit oh imagine how much pain those assholes never learned i guarantee you marc hamill
on set when delivering all this shit was just like let's just get it done like snatches the
script out of somebody and he's like all right what do i say palpatine's still alive and you
can kill him because you're the one it's all been about ray no i genuinely believe he he will still
be trying like that's the kind of soldier he is i guess i'm trying to represent his mental state
yes he'll probably be the best actor at this film like there's a good chance uh adam driver's got
talent i get him driver as an actor yeah well that's a lot of silence killed a lot of silence then
it was a lot of silence oh yeah good job guys
whoa can't say that adam we said something nice that's right we said something nice and
adam's good in the other stuff that i've seen kylo he just seems to emote a lot to me he's very
that's that's yeah you know i'm just like you're doing great adam you're doing great
anyway ray supposedly sorry yeah go ahead i'm just gonna say a lot of these characters like
boyega we've seen him do stuff before oscar isaac's i love oscar isaac's and a lot of stuff he's in
but his character just fucking is fucking great why are you both saying isaac's it's isaac i said
isaac i didn't say i said i said isaac's because i like him so much
oscar i like ouchie ouchie's my favorite yeah ouchie oscar was the old plane in jj the jet plane
thank you rex just no idea how much i got called jj the jet plane at fucking school
never met another little guy like this so much love with the sky like this buckle up tight
it's magical flight with jj the jet plane how'd you know that because i'm the oldest of four
motherfucker i know all the songs all right then yeah jj was a fucking little bitch i think we're
even exhausted from this nonsense we're reading oh yeah brains have melted this is true oh yeah
dude mine is soup right now seriously i can't keep up anymore i don't want to be here
well honestly i mean i mean in a planet where this trilogy exists that's where i'm picturing
the critique for this i've ever spent like 10 years at every seed they'll be like right
there's a lot of things to talk about with this one weird uh ray supposedly asks to speak to layer
at one point but luke responds by telling her that layer has not yet completed her training
and he cannot yet feel her distinctive consciousness within the force
wait ray hasn't completed her training she gets better layer oh layer okay you know that
you know that the dead character oh now i'm confused i remember more apparently when you
become a forceman you can train to become a forceman that can be seen by others
okay well but hon has completed his training
all right now we're seeing some reshoots that's a that's an actual problem though
god damn can you imagine being the dude who's like the law guy on set because i'm pretty sure
they do have him but you just fucking give up at one point you just slab the ground with a fist
like why like why that's our seventh law guy this week who gave up he's saying they just tell us
whatever we do is fine that's what they hire them for they're just like a legal thing like yeah we
had a law guy totally yeah but that's why you know that's why they you know we got away with
the hypersite space ram and tlj the law guys are like yeah she'll do it okay yeah whatever it's i
i just i just changed the water and the water cooler and they're like hey use five bucks can
you do this in star wars just write down everything is fine law-wise yeah then sign your name here
with your initials for legal reasons thanks to get legal legal to do it i'm gonna assault this
water cooler um i'm gonna watch this water cooler shit i'm watching it pee it's only okay to watch
someone's shit if it's a woman watching me anyway so by the end of the conversation ray is re-energized
for the seemingly insurmountable task that lies ahead of her and agrees to leave the island
so we keep getting the force ghost pep ups here what the fuck they need them they need
force ghosts to be like hey do it okay none of the alive characters are good yeah remember
the dead characters be ruined they're back yeah they're better when they're dead
haha when they're dead just just like they're better when they're dead this is so fucking
ridiculous luke raises his x-wing like the fact that they're able to interact with everything
that it's just it doesn't make any sense why fucking obi-wan couldn't help out luke
during the entire original trilogy yeah he just pictured him throwing things at palpatine while
the fight's happening he's like stop it stop it eat a wrench here's a pipe
pulls a bucket of sludge all over and he's like ah what the fuck is this
having destroyed the ship she used to come to act two luke raises his own x-wing previously
seen submerged in the coves of the island to allow ray to face palpatine even luke's x-wing
who would have been like under water for 30 years and it just works i don't know how long
it's been there but any amount of time would be suspicious she flew oh cheese maybe i don't know
she well i guess if it's i guess i guess if it's built to be insulated from the vacuum of space
it could keep water out i've i've been told that is not how that works yeah no it's a pressure
thing oh yeah that there was like a significant role in this film it was like a futurama bit on
that and like oh well how do you know this spaceship's gonna work underwater well it's
a spaceship so the pressure should be uh between zero and one yeah and then the pressures of this
other war are completely different um anyway yeah in addition it's not it's not the pressure
because it's like right by the surface you're still very different to it a space also yeah
yeah i don't know the specifics on this but having water surrounding it versus just nothing
or whatever like there's there's differences i don't know what they are not to make sure
it's a fucking rust man surely that shit would rust no no they don't have a stainless steel
yeah they always say that your spaceships keep pressure in submarines go google it rax find out
if you're right i don't know i'm just i don't know how spaceships work and i said i said go google
it he said i don't know no no no i i i thought no it's like i'm not i'm not that invested in this
oh and i mean it's not gonna corrode or anything fuck this isn't my this isn't exactly my biggest
problem with this film really what else is there most of it is great the fact that i don't know
is is actually this is my only problem yeah they fix this and it'll be um airtight ha ha
all right that many reshoots it's all good in addition to the star starfighter luke
x-wing
luke gifts ray with a lightsaber that once belonged to leah why don't you just give her the one she
threw away wow how the hell did he get it lightsaber it was in the it was in the beginning
at all times it was in the beginning of the movie say they trained leah so i guess this is what it
is now oh wait he tells her how leah left his saber with luke when she stopped training and
luke kept it on him but how does that translate to when you're a ghost like how did it what
maybe he loads over to his hut hey i kept it up okay oh don't you don't want to keep that
i thought he grabbed the lightsaber she threw why don't you just give him that one
because you're talking retarded that one's anakin's that one's not good enough you can sink
whole ships you can use the lightsaber too fucking layer had a lightsaber okay
he then points ray to where he kept it in oh it's in his it's in a hut okay okay that that
that makes it make more sense uh ray boards the x-wing that lightsaber was definitely there through
all yes yes ryan was very aware of that lightsaber uh ray boards the x-wing armed with the coordinates
for palpatine's location obtained from vader's wayfinder and leaves the planet oh right
the resistance jungle base after returning to the jungle base several things happen
after seeing the sacrifice made by 3 p.m several things happen because enough hasn't happened
too much r2 reveals that he has a backup of c3po's memories at his archives
of course okay and he didn't bring it up when it's gonna happen listen it's just what it's
what droid friends do they back up each other's memories i mean it's just he was there he was
there for the scene where c3po's memory gets wiped is so why didn't r2 be all like oh it's
no big deal just go ahead this is gonna be hilarious okay he wasn't there though that
was just that was bba no he was being a he was being a pal and he wanted r2 he wanted c3po that
i cap his hero movement moment not hero movement that's right in kyla's bathroom but i'm talking
about this c3po like like r2 is such a pal but like this is what we suggested when we were
reading it making a hero moment we were like just have a copy of it but then later the film was like
there was a copy the whole time just like fuck off okay uh it says it's an older c3po but it's
better than no 3po at all uh sure it's an older code but it checks out lander reant wait why
couldn't uh if they know that data could be copied why didn't they all think to copy his memories
before it happened well that's that's part of what we brought up yeah yeah r2 was there r2 was there
while they're wiping his memory well he was standing well no hang on uh let me send you a
timestamp for it in the trailer yeah no i know it doesn't matter it doesn't matter though because
they could still edit it jay it could still not be that right because chubaka is also there right j
and we know that you want to be dead so they edit that in so you think that he's actually friends
why would c3po why would r2 not be there though wait no hang on i'm watching the scene no tobacco
doesn't look like he's there oh it doesn't matter anyway like i said they could still change it
but you're right if if they keep him there the leaks at the moment no yeah i said like i said
you're if fucking hell i said if he is there it will be stupid but i'm pretty sure they're gonna
change it and also jay you just cited the fucking trailer not the leaks yeah jay jay oh yeah chewy
is there in the trailer never mind it's hard and blue plane got him
uh so lando reenters the story okay uh having changed his mind coming to the jungle base and
wanting to help however he can gotta get everyone together yeah it's gonna be a big final battle
it is at this time that ray begins transmitting coordinates to the unknown regions obtaining
from the obtained from the wayfinder to the resistance resistance mobilizers readying
themselves for the impending conflict this is so everybody's gonna team up to attack his army of
death stars destroyers while ray and kylo team up to fight palpatine that's probably it and then
so how many star destroyers are there one point two billion maybe there you go
give or take a few uh ray follows the coordinates found in the wayfinder to the same spot kylo did
earlier in the film i guess she found the cube ray lands outside the giant cube floating above
the ground and makes her way through the same underground passage the cube composed of black
rock floats several meters above the ground and is so massive that one corner whoa one corner
cannot be seen in the frame when the camera is at another whoa that's a big thing that's a big
thing yeah that's so big that's not even wow in the film wow can't it's can't even
are you guys impressed by this train oh man figure how big it is you can't even see all of it
as ray travels down into the depths of the planet giant sith statues can be seen
where ray and kylo's experiences begin to differ come in with where ray discovers palpatine
palpatine is not in the same chamber that kylo discovered him in but in a huge arena
surrounded by sith loyalists and dark cloaks in the grandstands okay the aids are back oh are they
here yeah the aids are up and running i guess yeah all right here um palpatine is being supported
by some kind of mechanical arm possibly connected him connecting him to uh life support machinery
ray begins to confront palpatine you need life support after what he's been through
just a bit yeah like maybe maybe just some morphine should be right um during this conversation
Sidious this is not how you spell Sidious uh reportedly confirms ray's lineage and goads
here on to take up a lightsaber and strike him down very much like how he encouraged luke to
do the same thing 30 years prior i don't know if you guys knew that did you guys you did you know
that oh wow didn't didn't even seem familiar to me at all it's like poetry he's really happy they
put that in there uh telling her that only in killing him will she gain the power needed to
save her friends palpatine also apparently makes statements alluding to the belief that vader could
not betray luke due to their familial bond and that same kind of bond would ultimately cause ray
to do what the emperor wishes what so so so it wasn't vader's choice he just sort of had to
because he was a family member i don't think that's how that works but emperors well you made it my
car yeah that's yeah yeah darth fader didn't even choose to do the heroic things he did so
fuck you he was related to luke he was fucked fuck you old character you suck during his taunts
the sickly sith opens the roof of the stadium chamber revealing that the sky above is filled
with star destroyers soon to be embroiled in combat with the approaching resistance how exciting
wow really as the battle wait to hear how they all get destroyed oh yeah it's gonna be great
as the battle between the first order slash empire i like that they've just almost given up
call them the first order it's like this fucking empire the resistance begins to rage in the skies
above them what resistance i don't know the 20 people that now have become like a thousand people
or something from star wars rebels that's who they all got together like because we've seen
the pictures of all these fucking star destroyers how do the what are the resist there's like
how what ships who well we get the shot in the trailer of literally it looks like they
just took every style of ship they'd ever seen in a fucking star wars movie comic game anything
and pile it all together for one fucking shot um so the whole galaxy of misfits are joining
together to resist this i don't know uh okay ray gives into the emperors commands and decides to
strike him down uh through means like what she's what got all of these ships to assemble
i i don't like the destruction of five planets not do it for you i mean it's not it's not really
covered in this it's like i don't know what brought them all together i guess just we gotta beat the
thing do they have steel skin good reference lando lando knows a bunch of people yeah i don't
they're just a bunch of old there's a bunch of old contacts yeah he's like i got in touch with
some old contacts fucking damn it dude well we've we've been told wedge antilles um so maybe wedge
knows some fucking old people from back in the day they're gonna come assassinate their characters
as well some like a series of elderly people like let's do it we've got this
they're fighting for a good current someone some chat said parents angry that their kids
have been kidnapped so they're gonna go so they're gonna go kill them what the fuck they're angry at
the kids they're angry at the kids for getting kidnapped i'll see this is this by the way if
this was the movie again the idea of having a cinema full of people who are ready to laugh at
this can you imagine the laughter erupting in the audience it would be so great i want to go i want
to like i go to a special like yeah obviously it's going to be shit screening full of like-minded
people that's what they call it and they're like the odian sort of uh listings like the obviously
it's going to be shit showing like odian is what is a company over here oh she's going to be in
seattle around that time and uh you know being seattle as crowded as it is i'm wondering what
the crowded theater is going to react to a lot of this if it's true if it's true
oh my god at least we're close to the what you could call an end i think uh through means that
are still a bit foggy ben solo was able to leave the wreckage of the death star and his former
persona behind and travel to exegol uh with the purpose of joining ray to help face down
cidius before leaving the death star yes he destroys his first owner he destroys his fursuit
um before leaving the death star wreckage ben abandoned kylo's lightsaber so now he's walking
into a war zone with no weapon okay uh yeah when he arrives on the planet he encounters the knights
of ren who are guarding the entrance to the arena where ray and cidius are ben reportedly
dispatches each of the music only the force what was the point of that all right that's consistent
with what we know oh my god ray uh not ray jj was so happy to bring him back and apparently all
they do is like stand around in one scene and just get killed later like oh all right then yeah
because i thought weren't they in like i guess maybe i don't understand what happened to them
i thought they're in the shuttle that chewy they thought chewy was in but all right yeah i get
it we'll have to see the movie because this is like one of the most inconsistent set of leaks
ever like this isn't just contradicting stuff we already know from other stuff it's like this
script itself is so confusing um but it's so detailed it has to be fucking yeah like i'm so
i'd be surprised if all this was made up i seriously doubt it and that's the thing it's
consistent with what we see in the trailers as well it makes all of the stuff we saw in the
trailers make sense yeah like uh in a narrative way which it's really hard to do from just a
trailer well we're at the point where nothing is too nonsensical for star wars now so that helps
yeah space wizards it's for children guys yeah talk talk think about it written on a t-shirt
oh yeah oh yeah he did do that didn't he rags do you know about that i think i showed you right the
the patrick will shit where he's just got it's a space movie the space wizards meant to fucking
out i can't even speak anymore it's a very bad bro yeah bro just like just like fucking freddy
fucking princess we're fucking kids bro he he had but that sentence that jay just said he's put that
on a t-shirt and he's selling it to people oh the sentence oh no it's such an embarrassing
fucking sentence that is why would you want that on a t-shirt that is embarrassing it's an insanely
stupid thing to say especially with somebody who loves the film to death and he can't get enough
he argues it's a masterpiece with like incredibly deep themes and it's how do you say that that while
simultaneously being like guys stop caring about it meant for children and then that just brings
it the whole why can't you care about something that was made for a child what he also has a
shut up about plot holes shirt he was so wrong about that too internet told him he was wrong
and put them on a bed shit on a shirt he keeps next shirt is gonna be like a review from a white
guy probably isn't gonna have much to say about black panther yeah i noticed you didn't put that
on a fucking shirt oh well that's that's this next one if he makes a shirt about the rise of skywalk
he's gonna fucking the font's gonna be really small the fuck about this movie oh yeah the name
of this film is rise of skywalker i know what we're getting to with that uh all right all right let's
let's just get to the end let's kick on after doing this he enters the arena as ray is about
to strike the emperor using leah's blade ben grabs anakin's lightsaber and warns ray to
reconsider what she's about to do to kill to not kill the emperor in anger kill him in happiness
seeing bed arrive pleases sitius he then uses his power to bond them together and begins to siphon
power from that bond and direct it into himself what siphoning raise power when she was
i guess you can only do it to the dyad rags it has to be the dyad it shows up oh there you are
as the power flows into him the once silky and decrepit palpatine why does this say silky
looky the one's creamy and decrepit palpatine stands tall
uh strong once again restoring himself to a much younger healthier state creamier state so we get
we get original sheath back all right she's untestically she's got to be a typo what the fuck
does silky mean silky and creamy i don't know um while all this action is happening on the ground
much more explosive events are happening in the sky the resistance and the first order are locked
in battle the details i have on what happens during this branch of the plot are a bit sparse
at the moment but here's what i've been told the resistance arrives and they are confronted with
hundreds of palpatine's sith star destroyers their goal is to take out the flagship of the
destroyers where general pride is located uh taking out the flagship will supposedly sever
communications with the rest of the fleet and prevent them from being able to navigate the
perils of the unknown regions wow that's convenient what that's because they're manned by children
you think about how many people are on these ships and how big these ships are and you're like
can't they store information on these no they have to have that one ship lead them all it whatever
that's just remember the tlj's logic of uh all ships have trackers but only one of them is ever
active yeah that makes sense right so dumb it's so all of it's so dumb but yeah a convenient way
to knock them all out at once you just got to knock out the big i just like the idea there's
like general pride this seems like a weakness in our set of ships and he's like no no
just seems fine to me but our data plan can only afford to have one
also this means they can't navigate what is it navigate the um unknown regions the unknown
regions like okay so i get well is it implying that there's like a there's like an environment
of like rocks and shit or something just stay here win the battle and then when you're done
like sort that out yeah yeah sort that out that has a communications rate yeah um that's really
dumb at one point during the battle fin and jana or jana jana joined by others but exactly who is
not clear to me right now land on pride's flagship to destroy it they recognize this as essentially
a suicide mission but fin and jana in particular see the price they may have to pay as worth it
i think that's supposed to be worth it um and they're doing it because it will prevent
more children from being abducted like they once were oh how thematically relevant they're
really pushing this child in this film it's like so fucking cheap is like you don't want
children to be abducted do you that's a bad wouldn't steal a child download a child
one of my sources described it to me like a d-day type mission for the resistance where they attempt
to land on a moving star destroyer amidst the battle scene okay on horses right space horses
where the fucking horses come from the movie about space horses intended for children
i actually think that i think there's part of this i think that like the star destroyers we
saw in the trailer they're like fucking underground or some shit because you see a scene of them like
bursting up through oh yeah i think that they're going to be the whole space horsing i think they're
like just riding horses on the planet when the fleet begins to come out so they're like happening
on top of one it could be right yeah that's what i've always thought and which is you know
this space is stupid is really fucking dumb but i think that's how that scene comes about
oh anyway uh having returned to full strength palpatine then shoots lightning into bed
forcing him to fall into a bottomless abyss well we know those who are fatal anymore so he's cool
never to be seen again yeah that's it he's fine that's how that's how he dies right there
no no no no it's he'll be fine if the planet they're on after explodes because that'll cancel out
the aids that's it for kylo he just falls off a fucking cliff whoa that's one less shit character
but i just want to hear the willhelm scream that's why i want to hear
i need to know uh like what kylo fans think of that they don't care about quality
yeah they don't give a fuck they're like wow what a great send off to my great character
yeah you you've seen the videos right there's loads of
and this is such a deep well fleshed out character yeah this was a really deep video essays about
kylo about how amazing he is as a character it's like he turns up and he falls off a fucking cliff
like that's good that almost seems like jj's fucking with him i don't know really the best
part is that there's no there's no ralo bullshit no no no as he's falling off so far as he's falling
off the cliff he comes just a spiral it's like it's like reaching out hand
i wish you floor skype him on the way while he's down and gives him you know
flash one it's a long it's a really long fall so she has time to four skype him before he dies
one last force ball
one last time
yeah all right like i don't know i just i needed time to acclimate so that i think
mauler is broken the idea that he falls he just falls off a cliff that's insane but okay yeah
it's not that it's it's like watching someone you've never met before to shoot themselves in
the head i'm like whoa you mean like predator and then you're like why do you care you've met
that person i'd be like i don't need to have met them yeah but still like what it's sub it's
literally like subversion of expectations right we have all this build up of him in this movie he
finally seems to make a choice he's turning back to the light side for good and then he just is
unceremoniously thrown out for cliff fucking dead yeah we've been ray all by herself
for now
but no one's ever really gone oh my god imagine him coming back in the sequel sequel trilogy
or he'll just come back immediately as a force goes yeah or he'll just come back at the end
it's kind of a stinger yeah the last scene in the movie is just him like he's like just falls to the
bone of the cliff and he's like oh that hurt well because honestly right uh when you see something
like this happen however they film it it's the kind of you remember golem getting flung off by
Frodo just before she loved his shit it's kind of like oh he'll be back and i love the idea that
you see it and you're like oh kyla will be back and the credits rolled you're like kylo
where are you where are you buddy the end of the movie he's sitting on like a branch at the
edge of a cliff just like they do in the cartoons oh no he's um uh at the other post-credit scene
he's like ramesses at the end of prince of egypt where he's just like on his rock cursing
that's just how it ends you don't know what happens doing after that he's just angry uh
Sidious then shoots lightning into the sky at the resistors that's a real thing that happens
that's the picture you remember that picture oh my god that's gonna happen yeah i'm gonna have such
a huge grin on my face in the cinema when that happens if he's doing it with finger guns i can
forgive this whole movie it's gonna be jazz hands yeah jazz hands as long as it's not clapping
i mean good lord this is like you have to take a step back sometimes and just be like yeah this
is real yeah it's like we're not in some alternate universe or anything
yeah it's real when you read it it's it's very much kind of like game of thrones you read you're
like oh it can't be like that and i can't wait till we actually get to see it because it is gonna
be this bad reading the game of thrones leaks oh it's probably gonna be more fleshed out than
that though isn't it he's gonna be like that they gotta even more people are saying like
you know it might turn out to be a lot different and i'm like what if it turns out to be one-to-one
with this oh oh my goodness i would be so happy so i think that the ending is going to be the
thing that can change based on what we've heard uh it looks like the ending is where all right
well i guess yeah we'll get to reading this so he reportedly continues making statements about how
ray will join him in defiance of this ray grabs both anakin and layers lightsabers and palpatine
turns his wrath on her it's a lightsaber versus lightning at this point or it's lightning
versus lightsaber at this point and when it seems like all hope is lost for ray the specters of luke
and layer come to her aid they jointly work toward overpowering oh no overpowering the emperor
deflecting lightning back toward himself killing him and unleashing an explosion powerful enough
to make the arena start to crumble around them darth cidius the last of the sith lords is finally
dead no he was dead a long time ago film he was dead a long time ago how how does that kill him
but the exploding death this is actually terrible by the way having the force ghosts fuck the fight
up completely because this is exactly the same as the hyperspace kamikaze you don't do this
because nobody else has done it and if you do it you fuck up every fight that's happened before now
thanks a lot like and now if they kill him now then he'll just come back as a forest
ghost and he's even more powerful this is a joke like this is this is every possible like
stupid you could do that would remain after ryan had done all of his stupid like what else can we
fucking ruin how can this force ghost being able to just alter fights like that really yep i still
can't get over the fact that this doesn't like contain further explanation no what i survived what
the leaks are this is just is it honestly looking more forward to this film now after we've read
through this i mean you you you've read this already right yeah yeah yeah i'd read it but
but just going through it and and really picking it apart uh i'm now more excited than ever thank
no problem at this same time fin and jana complete their mission and succeed in destroying
pride's flagship i guess that's just something they can do of course they do that's something
two people can just do they fire their horses they figured it out they found the horsepower
they went into the control room and they pressed the button and it exploded everything nailed it
and ten bucks says that in this sequence fin will be useless and jana will be the most badass
female character who was ever badass ever and she's just insanely good she just kills all the
stormtroopers and does all the button pressing do you like how fin is goofy about it he's like
oh what what you killed people whoa whoa the super basic screenwriting thing as well they're
like what can fin do in this movie uh we need to make it make some like sort of arc what was his
thing against like oh he was like a kid who was made to be a stormtrooper and he escaped i guess
like oh uh make it so that he stops the first order from stealing a bunch of kids i guess that'll work
what should you do up to that point nothing oh damn john you're gonna experience even more
messages from people saying they were disappointed even more uh this right yeah so uh the two are
prepared to go down with the ship but they are rescued in the last second by the falcon
because of course ray escapes the crumbling arena did you imagine ray just died or none of us would
believe it we'd be like no no they were not gonna happen having it having a one the day it ends with
everyone being a forest ghost luke player they'll just hang it out and everything's better even
sydius is there he's like uh so uh now what do you want to play monopoly or something
i call the hat
they all start battling over who wants the hat i'm the hat god damn it i'm a sith lord i don't
take this shit from people that's fine if i can be the car you're the plane the jet plane there
isn't a plane apparently uh the what's been altered about this is the
ray's on the floor and she hears the voices of obi one layer and a soaker
and she like channels all of that into herself and beats palpatine herself
how the fuck who who does she oh that fixes everything i was gonna say that's just still
just fucking terrible but okay that's even what she doesn't know who obi one canobi is
does she even know like that luke skywalker feel like a year ago she didn't even know who luke was
is ridiculous so we're nearly there we're nearly there so yeah having won the day obviously the
survivors of the battle regroup at the jungle base and celebrate what follows is apparently
celebration across the galaxy once again mirroring what we saw at the end of return of the jet well
of course because that's all this ever was was it didn't quite end in return of the jedi okay now
it's ended yeah now it's ended now we can have now it's ended for realsies this time until disney
wants more money i don't know if they can make any more money when is the galaxy gonna get sick
of these evil empires destroying planets well when are they gonna do something i thought the
rules were that now that there's a bunch of jedi or at least ray the force is gonna bring up a new
seth of equal power that's how this works right that's how you balance the force yeah yeah it's
completely fucking wrong it's for ray to kill herself no because then because then there'll be
a someone else and no one's ever going to be better than ray so she needs to stick around as like
but doesn't she want to become better by killing yourself is kylo is kylo good or evil is he but he's
a good man now he's dead i guess he's a dead man you see the thing is that he fell off a cliff so
he's fine no no we not in this fucking universe i need to see a body what do you mean you just
see a body as if that'll change anything no when when have we seen a dead body that came back
uh yeah it depends on what constitutes a dead body because like does bald cat my corpse i want
i want a corpse okay i want a doctor in fact we literally had palpatine obliterated and you're
like exactly there's no body exactly there was no we didn't get a body why are you obsessed with
the body because i we need to confirm visually that there is a i'm suggesting though that that
doesn't fucking matter in this universe they will you don't need to confirm there's a corpse you
need to fucking like see the corpse and then see it be slowly like cut apart separated by atoms
hold on didn't we see as long as you if you see it that's fine once you've got to have the body
first i like the idea that they're doing that with with palpatine they're cutting him into atoms to
make sure he's definitely gone as soon as they finish the camera pans up and palpatine's like
as a ghost yep he's gone like fuck sake gosh it'll take me like four months to reform yeah he's
definitely got it except i have forced body heal i was just hoping you would say like oh uh they
they show like they show them cutting up palpatine so he's definitely gone and then just the ending
of the film as it pans up and palpatine still they're like i survived jesus ray what the fuck
are you doing palpatine's body for months this is getting a bit weird right it puts the lotion on
its skin it's just that montage where they're all cut in pieces and palpatine's one of the people
doing it he's got the piece with them like they really upbeat music
okay get my dead dick off here we go here we go so you're cutting off you're cutting off the creepy
so bear in mind this is probably not going to be what the actual ending is there could be a whole
bunch of endings whatever this is one we got so for the end of the film the heroes then travel
to where everything began the desolate sand swept planet of tatooine oh no that no that's nabu i
mean yeah nabu's where it began yeah technically that's where all the story began yeah the space
the space over nabu and the nabu orbit yeah that's like they haven't even seen phantom
man it's disgusting um between defeating cidius and this moment ray has disassembled anakin and
layers lightsabers and used their components to construct one of her own that i'm told contains
a gold yellow blade okay it's a holy blade ray buries the leftover pieces beneath the
tatooine stands at the site of the la's homestead as ray i'm gonna i'm gonna bury your lightsabers
with your bodies but not not the useful bits i'm keeping yeah i'm keeping that as ray turns to
join finpo janet chewy r2 3po bb8 and do because everyone loves do a stranger calls out to her
the stranger apparently speaks of how nobody has been seen around this land for a very long time
and asks ray for her name this is the second time in the film that this question has been posed to
her but unlike her response to pasana on pasana ray has decided who she is she gives the name
ray skywalker to the stranger adopting the name of her masters at revealing the primary meaning
of the title of the film hear that though ray has decided who she is this is all going into
you can identify whatever the fuck you want to identify as it's a social commentary identify
as the character people love bullshit fuck you this is hurt ryan johnson fuck you jj abrams
fuck you kathleen well you said that they can't this could all be up for change but they can't
change the title sake of the film well it could be something else i don't know so i i don't know
the part that people have been talking about is changing is the battle sequence between
kylo and palpatine and ray because evidently the first screening like ray just fuck it was
described as ray kerb stomped palpatine and the audiences were like are you fucking kidding me
so they reshot it a couple times with different cast audiences that's the rumor
i'm you know honestly guys i feel like this is probably it like this is actually the film
most of this i feel like this is what we get it makes it makes sense that it would be this
uh as ray begins to join her begins to rejoin her friends she catches a glimpse of some familiar
going figures watching over here the assembly of heroes look off to the distance of the horizon of
the desert planet watch the twin sun set on a universe filled with hope fuck you
i hope we see force from now and we need another new evil galactic empire to blow up some more
fucking planets until there's no fucking planets left i hope we see uh watches i hope we see force
i hope we see force goes jar jar and yeah apparently there are more um from this guy that
are like changes edits and redos of whatever information that's cycling in and out and stuff
but i mean that's probably the chunk of it adam driver seemed pretty excited about the
direction of his character just for bed to be thrown off a cliff i'm gonna get down for it to
hell but i think this is terrible don't worry buddy we're right there with who read this and
thought it was great please tell me comments are all just like finding issues with it it's
it's just it i can't help like um i want this film at this point it seems falling into an
abyss to your death in the star wars universe just means you will come back even stronger
yeah yeah thanks somebody somebody says darth cideus and they quoted darth cideus the last of
sif lords is finally dead finally man i was so stressed out at the end of return of the jedi i'll
be yeah they look they look into the sky with the fireworks the music and the happiness they're
like what are we gonna do with city is still alive i like how literally nobody on the planet
thought that palpatine had survived
boom he's back he's already finally dead they are a bunch of cunts like there's no other way
to fucking look at this like how could you star wars is really awesome like it was really cool
this is a good comment say you're saying force ghost leah and luke watch ben get pushed into
the abyss but they help out ray that's that's like oh my god my mentor that i think i failed
and my son ah fuck him let's hell let's help out ray jesus if this leak is real remember that the
story is written by the same guy who thought it'd be better for leah to mourn han's death by hugging
someone she's never met instead of chewy i'm chewy probably smelled a bit where was matt smith
in this whole thing uh he was playing uh onision no he was he was the frick character
he was ochi and frick he was every character that we haven't confirmed like who they're
played by yet he was he was kylo fuck it adam drive was excited about playing kylo because
they're working towards something in particular with him i think i'd have picked a different
favorite character if i'd known that something in particular meant being used as a re-energizer
battery and then yeeted into the abyss so bad someone just says thanks i hate it yep
we're sweet and to the point taking out the command ship renders the rest of the fleet unable
to navigate you fucking serious could you seriously make the f-o more incompetent than
they were in tlj this is so non-threatening are they going to be even more non-threatening
this is this is like they've actually managed to find it they've managed to find the mood
everyone fucking hate this what a what a trilogy man tlj fans uh but people who were turned off
at tlj people who were turned off uh force awakens everyone everyone's gonna hate this
this movie was made for people fucking eric but this is who this movie was made for just stuff
things happen fuck it shit eric both is gonna love it laugh and clap consume product cheap
this also this uh this comment here luke's x-wing was functionally didn't use it this is really
going to sit well with the tlj haters this includes myself yeah it was it was so it was
functional the whole time oh fuck i completely forgot yeah luke people are arguing it wouldn't
have worked yeah yeah but yeah this is confirmation that luke could have just fucking left whenever he
wanted yep but uh you know pulled it up out of the sea probably is better than ever and has some
barnacle blasters on it barnacle blasters yeah yeah can't wait to see through psi the n-word though
oh yeah that's the big part of it well that's the that's the leaks and i know that people are like
hey there's more there's difference there's there's like i think we've covered the bulk
and it looks like the differences are significant but um mostly like running along the same track
if that makes sense um i don't i don't know what do you guys any other thoughts before we move on
i thought it was great i really liked it it's my favorite film no lie
i mean with all this yeah i mean that's the whole thing is there's nothing the people that
are gonna be left to dip in this are gonna not be taken seriously at all um whether you
you know again i was a fan of the force awakens and then after the force or after the last jedi
kind of ruined the force awakens for me but there were people that hated the force awakens initially
you've gotten every pretty much you've gotten everyone at this point that hates this trilogy
except for a few mindless zombies and this is just going to confirm everything we've been
saying about this trilogy i can't wait for it i'm looking forward to it and i i'm serious i want
alden erin reich force ghost hon solo i'm calling it if um if it is just like this this film's gonna
be talked about for a while this is this is bad this is gonna be like the fucking this is gonna
be the beginning of the end for like this kind of shit happening in hollywood and a lot of these
comments are pissed off at binn's death at kind of keep getting away with it if they keep why i
mean that's why that's why it was stunned and then they made shit films and now they've made films
so shit that even the people who love those shit films are pissed off there's a comment right here
that i think we're going to see a lot of this person says i've been a huge defender of the
series i've argued for ray said that much of her journey was similar to luke's now i feel like a
fool i was i was hoping this last movie would validate what i was really did the opposite yeah
that's what we're gonna see a lot i would be curious to ask what what that person was gunning
hoping for because this mostly seems in line with what we've seen the idea that she's got all these
powers that she can just do the fact that she's the most important person in the world everyone
likes her like this is all stuff we've seen before you know we're gonna get we're gonna get
people saying that this is this film is so bad because of the backlash to tlj that oh that'll
be a take yeah this is bad because of tlj it's like no it's bad because everyone hated tlj so
they got jj and now we have to deal with this shit film thanks tlj haters did everyone specifically
say that he couldn't help luke as a force ghost he says i cannot interfere but some people like
to try and interpret that to mean he chooses not to on a moral level which i think is bullshit
let's make uh galaxies at stake that's some stupid shit well yeah and that doesn't that
only addresses him what about the rest of the fucking force ghost so fucking cavalcade on them
yeah remember there's a whole jedi order thousands of jedi this is the thing if i had taken over
before episode seven was even made i'd be like so this whole force ghost thing we cannot let them
be massively influential because that'll ruin everything they have to be limited otherwise
our whole universe falls apart yeah it needs to be like the original like the originals it needs
to be ambiguous as to if they're even there or if they're just appearing in the mind of the observer
very very very amorphous very yeah yeah but if yoda can use force lightning
why don't you just come back and fight i don't understand any of this
i can he wasn't force lightning people exactly like why are you okay you're there you want to
you know blow up the whatever that was on the last shut eye and then we'll go back and fight
the first order help luke you know go ahead do your thing this is fucking broken it's broken
why didn't he help the first fight against palpatine like it this breaks fucking everything
star wars does not make again they keep doing it like this again to reiterate what i said before
about the whole like oh this this film if it's gonna repair it's got a huge hefty hard job ahead
of it but it didn't bother with repairs it just broke everything even more at least from what
we've seen so chat are you happy with what you've seen today like it how what do you guys think of
what might be episode nine rise of ray skywalker this sandworm pleaser i that was a thing that
happened oh my god this film's so dense there's so much in it like there's a port there's a
part where ray heals a giant vicious sandworm why out of nowhere this comment's good so the last
film of the skywalker saga ends with the last skywalker being thrown into a pit in a palpatine
taking the skywalker name oh that's painful in that did you guys agree that kylo probably the
most popular character in this trilogy yeah yeah and and and yeah with them if this is how he dies
and i think it's i think we all think he's gonna die every leak has had him dying if i'm not
mistaken ryan am i correct on that uh yeah he definitely dies and so that's gonna piss off
the the one thing that you've got this at least got a few people on board they're gonna piss
everybody off with this film i love it i can't wait oh yeah this is a moment of join us join us
on the team of this was always bad because now you will feel that way because you know like
retroactively speaking um a lot of people feel that force awakens is pretty terrible too like
and it's a matter of just going back and looking at it much more critically instead of and this is
the thing i feel like it's like um waves of being tricked is not working anymore like uh a lot of
people didn't fall for force awakens a lot of people did loads of people didn't fucking fall for
tlj a lot of people did i don't think anyone's fallen for this film apart from people like
harrick butts like who the fuck's fallen for this so in the third act we so do we in the third act
do we simultaneously have the revelation that leah hasn't finished her force jedi training and luke
can't feel her presence in the force and then at the end she is a force ghost she finished her
training at the end yes well then yeah so i think they they're trying to say it's stupid i think
what they're trying to say is he like she can't feel her presence yet like she's still like
continuing her practice i don't know what the fuck i think he's the one that's coming to her
for one final lesson before she dies which is how to transition to a ghost uh more transitioning
but uh yeah i think that's what they're going for it's stupid but i think that's their explanation
what's the advantage of being alive
that's a great question i can't believe she just dies though are they gonna explain that like she
she just does she die of unhappiness a broken heart i just love like my people need me that
seems to be what it is skywalker name it's like just like it's like just disney the ultimate
fuck you to the old stuff like no ray is skywalker now
yeah so this fucking sucks yeah there's there's a sense of i want to wallow a little bit
this is a bit like uh yeah western peace star wars because it hasn't happened yet but the thing
is like this reminds me of the season eight game of thrones shit where you read it all and you're
like no that's not what it is if you tried to write something worse i don't know if you could
it probably end up being funny because how bad it is this is not the case this is just bad enough
to not i mean i think i'm gonna laugh at least once in the cinema for this one funny they're
gonna be they're gonna be flies cut in half in this film or equivalent that's the thing
we're talking about how bad 2019 has been for films and it's like the fucking the the masterpiece
of bad hasn't even come out yet like the one that we're really worried about right at the end of the
year to just to cap it off joker is the one thing this this year could do for us for mainstream
movies did you wait shaft came out this year right yes i liked shaft i'll tell you what ford
versus ferrari is a fantastic movie i know that's not going to appeal to a ton of people i mean it
might because of bale and matt damon but that is a great movie there you go three movies that were
were decent enough el camino that that counts too because it's not like everything else that we got
that's gonna be a thing
2020 guys what have we got what's what's what's the good news um 2020 uh black widow movie trump
black widow movie yeah we got black widow movie we got everything else is gonna be like do we
do we have reason to believe the black widow movie will be good no it could be good not at all
especially not with what she's been coming out and saying lately about over about her being
hyper sexualized and everything yeah i read that she said something like it was because of dudes
like some dudes but i was just like i thought she was very on board with it but okay i guess i was
wrong concerning what she wears to red carpet events and things like that i don't think she
has a problem at all with it um that was that's my take anyway so you think she's like been like uh
coaxed into saying it by people working on the film thinking it's good press
i don't know the fucking mcu is so full of like strong female characters it's like
not apparently not one of them is allowed to be sexualized like you can it's allowed for
characters to allow it to be sexy like when only for men utilizing every character it's fine
well if you remember um there was a thing i can't remember if it was in a video or like in an
article or something but um chris hemsworth said that he didn't want to take his shit off in the
third thaw because he'd done it and all the other ones as well and uh taeko it was like we've got
to get bums in seats like it's gonna end up in the trailer we got to do it it's just like oh
that that doesn't get talked about that's not a thing people discuss really it's just like oh
that's fine sexualize the men go for it but i mean that's the thing i know there's a fuck
of you sexualized men that's great sexualized palpatine
uh we're about we're about to watch a mainstream star wars movie that's got a lot of palpatine in
it that's about to happen guys uh weird to say the least um all right i got a bit of meme collecting
i'm gonna do for the next minute so you guys got to entertain yourselves okay okay i made a straw
poll if we put it in the chat oh yeah uh i think rags can do it he's a mod
get it get him to do it all right everybody i am going to put this straw poll into the chat
doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo everyone answer the poll i need everybody go to the poll
pokemon go to the polls she actually said that she said that that's that's going to be a light
in the in right that's the please clap of hillary clinton all right the votes are rolling in the
votes are rolling in oh that's button click the button click the button go go go click that's
intense go go oh it's not winning we still we got 250 votes we got 300 keep going don't stop voting
350 the 80 percent of people think is going to be worse than tlj out of a group of people who hate
tlj everyone vote vote vote we have 500 votes let's get to at least a thousand least a thousand
come on everybody there are four somehow four and a half thousand people watching this so i'm gonna
need less than if i know right someone i need uh i need a less than a fourth of you to vote but
that means you come on no snowflake thinks he's responsible for the avalanche click that link
might not load i gotta say jj you're doing something special if you can cause this reaction
like let's just think about it this is a subset of people who fucking hate tlj
and 80 percent of them think oh yes it's probably going to be worse yeah i don't think you will find
a more harsh group when it comes to the opinion of tlj then this fucking job more wretched hive
of scum and villainy wouldn't you say how stupid do you have to be to fuck up this hard
900 votes 100 more if you haven't voted then you are not doing your duty
i can't that's fucking there it is jesus oh nice it's coming out in 2020 50 950 come on let's go
let's get that four sonic let's get that fourth digit come on you bunch of freeloaders
vote in the poll pull your weight around here what do you think you do is sit on the internet
commenting all day no work work work vote vote and we've got in 2020 we have disney plus winter
soldier and falcon where we get to see uh everyone react all right we have i can't wait for thousand
votes all right here's the uh here's the result uh at 1020 votes we have 81 percent saying that
rise of skywalker will be the worst film not even close that's impressive major not even close
jj is like do you think this is because it's fresh is that what's happening right now
the front part of it ask people a year after this movie's coming which one's worse and i think we'll
probably get a closer split but yeah this film this film like really rubs it in yeah man if this
is anything close to the real plot then i think this is bad tlj is bad this film is like
conspicuously bad in ways like fucking like this film is like tea bagging you with how bad it is
suspicious amount of bad i think that um you're gonna see a lot of people blaming tlj like like
we said you had to be like well it could have been good but what could jj do after tlj i think
you're gonna see all that kind of shit oh yeah um it's not that bad it's as good as it could have
been yeah they did good with what they did um all right so anyway i've got some memes
got some wonderful wonderful memes they're like they're a one they're like an ambrosia in this
in this sea of bad um so this was referencing how i said when i was pitching efap to the board room
and i would have little wolf and rag puppets and doing their voices as a sort of pitch before they
were brought on okay i am i am my doggo this is one of uh pikachu's drawings for those
future telling spiders yeah there we go
here's a look it out for that oracle just be a spider please
god that was so long ago i forgot how stupid that was
it's um a rendition of what's been happening with uh batwoman yeah oh my goodness
head for jumping i'm better
fringy's out that's so good it's a terrifying batwoman but i love it it's a bobblehead
uh somebody calls played as me for halloween i guess uh that would be pretty much most of it
it's how you get there wow i hope you spooked some people and i hope that i hope that several
of the houses you went to were like oh mola yeah yeah i know that that character they worked
in like patrick william's house immediately slabs the door like fuck off like oh god um i
quite love this one it is a another rendition of that alien that fortier drew in the tco match
this one it has blinking eyes
oh look at him yay that alien just wait to be scanned it looks like marge simpson
i'm assuming he based it on that i don't know um i'm guessing this is based it on the shirt
this is in that's what i mean uh this is the in relation to us being a leftist podcast i imagine
uh jesus need to pull anter behind that um this is uh we've had a lot of uh work from from this guy
says uh realizing my current avatar is a little too elaborate to just throw into my meme so here's
another rags uh big titty rags glad you guys enjoyed my work so this business done a whole
bunch of awesome stuff i got some big old titties now you've probably got some back pain rags damn
i know right and i've walked on all fours so those things are just dragging
bayouin draws me with like eight just going straight down i like the uh he's
righted log bad bad on the uh page this is another one from that artist
let me spider what does the future hold well we've gotten a big blast of it today so not looking
good goodness i like how the future is scary but into drawing the blinds that don't really have
anything to do with it what you're doing it completes the image um this was in reference to
a part in the beginning of the stream what am i missing why am i not getting it um it's frozen
frozen let it go yeah we were talking about frozen too is it but is is like what am i singing to
is it you're being thrown is is it is that you guys in this in some way
it's very detailed though yeah no it's uh still like a 3d drawing tool thing it's pretty cool
uh he does a couple of them we've got a couple of them to show today actually uh this was the
the quick a quick meme for the mishap but uh suitable nonetheless
uh expertly edited expertly it's beautiful i like that we've had like two of those now and
they were both just like grabs of an image where they have a jpeg the background we've got um a
whole bunch of j j Jenny Jeb and the dawn memes coming this is this is we got a big meme section
here okay you're being warned um but these are all these are all up-to-date memes for example
debates are gay hates trump the carbon enemy
alt left or right whatever we need to be that day that's what we are will be your villain it's fine
pikachu drew this up everything everybody needs something to fight so your will be alt centrists
you seem cool have a McMuffin
a couple of McMuffin memes
daddy i want to make muffin i think this is a variation of the one you saw regs
McMuffins at home i'm going to say i can say the n-word there's a muffin guy there as well
hopefully it's actually i think that the c3po saying the n-word is such an amazing
speaking of which regs this should probably be your favorite fucking version of that meme
it's fucking perfect
i don't know what it says it's just a different language i can't possibly share what it says
it's gibberish i don't know it's tagged as n-word past dude
i'm a botic sweating to banter gay twitter is the big gay twitter is the big gay format
i mean format is a whole bit gold
i told you there's a lot of McMuffin memes
expertly crafted memeage this is actually a deep simpsons meme
it's when homer invents oh has poochie and he's like everyone should be asking where's poochie
but they've docked out the p of the o this this i don't know if you guys are prepared for this one
oh
don't stop man
it's so good
it's such a good drawing i know i'm going to say it had word
there's a big meme to come out of the stream c3po saying that
it's off
does he have a bulge robot has a bull be the pitch meeting again hello there ladies and
gentlemen i have proposition for a podcast what's that let me tell you a story blah blah
suppose misogyny blah blah i'll be the long man and that's efap you got yourself a youtube
oh yeah rags doesn't know about this the fucking guy there's a there's a guy we covered rice who
doesn't believe that people can get youtube channels without uh producers and executives
yeah i have i have seen that that can't be real i mean i want to believe exist rags i want to
believe rags i i still don't think i still don't think i don't believe it i want to believe it
i don't believe we used to have read all of these leaks and you still don't believe people
could be that stupid i don't believe you can be that no stupidity knows no depth
that is the second day there's gonna be a lot of gay finders oh yeah by the way this is like
apparently concept art or possible leak thing for the oracle person so we got some spider stuff
maybe oh my god that is a spider that's a fucking spider yeah i mean we don't know we don't know
yeah we don't know we don't know it is spidery get excited if the oracle is a spider in this
movie we know jj washes efap we know that is a fact dominated in this elf pig i don't know what
he's doing to it this is a strange image but uh
the jeff smells great rags thanks babe
i like the big titty rags freeze hanging out with the chat he's like
weekend warrior hanging out with jayce oh good yes big family smells great rags
oh the jeff has an exclamation mark on it excellent the jeff smells greatly
jep jep jep creamy sheath best player on the galaxy he got around yeah boy
what a suck the emperor's dick gotta get them in with me
oh god oh that 3po oh god also ema and gameplay has been making some good rats apparently
excellent stuff army of good rats storm vermin i'm just glad he knows the difference
because burn table certainly didn't teach us what the difference was
yeah latin x got some of them good rats
jj the jeff well your childhood's back to haunt you my friend
ochi is just passing out them McMuffins
god look at this shit thing what does this mean man
i love that that stock image exists yeah
oh yeah this is uh this has been mocked up by 72 try and make fun of i guess efap um but they've
made a mistake um apparently if i was to make a breakdown of this film it would be under 24 hours
that seems pretty ridiculous to me what do you guys reckon like this is part one of seven yeah
but you know the first part under 24 hours really might be that bad it might be that bad
something's going down well that's what i see all right well either way i uh i just i just
think it's an inaccuracy there should be a colon and another two numbers at the front of all of
that i agree they're shortening some time for sure they clearly have no idea what they're talking
like if you're gonna gun for the long man you could at least make your thing long that's that's
my that's just my um so this is a this is a set of memes now that we've had since since the
legendary thing that happened two weeks ago so um we got loads to catch up on nothing but exciting
artwork and memes first being uh i think some people might not even get this georgia picks up
massive bowler jared wilson for 2021 classic it's a lot of significant words to efap in that
piece of news all right um someone spotted this on the road it is uh excellent fruit and produce
oh excellent fruit and produce i think we're being ripped off right we've got some excellent
fruit on this podcast true yeah well molar over here claims to be an advocate of gender equality
and then boasts about how ray is a mary suit see this is an anime reference i can't be expected
to understand them but um sorry titties ooh i love titties i got some this is going to be very
relevant because there's a lot of jab memes send you drabs um wait a minute what's that in the
background it's like a is that the spider yeah the little guy the character above it does look
a little spidery now that there's a little character above the spider who do you think
it was ray is that guy puppet i'm it's killing my brain is soup right now but who's the puppet fell
the yeah that does not look like foxes just above the spider racist think all puppets look
alike yeah that's fucked up dude i don't think it helps that the image is kind of small but like
i don't know shut up um okay boop so it's uh pretty cool uh don made it to be the time person
of the year i don't know if you guys knew that uh it's pretty the man who inspired thousands
by being an apex heterosexual oh yeah straight pride worldwide it's just neat you know good job
don i think he deserved it i'm glad he beat out jab yeah yeah um so you got clinton zero
trub zero objectivity is 100 i guess no there's a lot going on in this you go um i i'm not even
sure what game this is because that's how out of the loop i am that's probably some weeb trash
since nobody's recognized it here it must be weeb trash must be waiting for chat to tell me
exactly what it is jeremy's the nintendo guy yeah and i don't know what that is
grand balloon is that what it is oh fire emblem oh yeah probably yeah yeah there you go fire emblem
i've had a couple of memes sent to me i don't know what show this is but there's like a gas
mass character in a suit so i get referenced a lot oh it's that new uh it was that independently
animated thing is it the hotel something has been hotel yeah that's the one yeah yeah apparently
i'm a main character and it neat yeah congrats man ideal female body yeah
film robert this guy with a funny mustache
he was just there was just no flattering picture of this man
that's the scary thing all these pictures are flattering
and you want you don't want to see what he really looks like his uh
film robert's nose and glasses look like the silly ones you pick up at a store and put on
i just keep looking from his face back to don
Harrison but uh
he looks ridiculous good old robert oh yeah this is a this is a hyper-specific meme but um
i was like working my ass off to get things done in in the one of the streams when i was a human
for the gaming thing and all of chat was constantly like balls of daily balls of daily i wasn't for
at least one of the rounds it's a it's a relevant meme this is kind of pixely but funny
just like the jab in the corner like that i love it
um all right so this one's interesting um you guys are gonna have to sort of
sync it up with me so it is a reddit post if you go to zero and then um prepare to press play if you
can loading from me uh you might have to click this one to bring it into an actual browser
oh there we go ready um ready everyone on zero yeah three two one play
oh
j has been kicked
um for j
blue blue checkbox attack you fap that you've got this riles got his house his rooftop
um another great simpsons meme um i can't remember if i showed this already but uh
sometimes the rotation gets some doubles but you kick j and he's right back he's back
heck
i love this was great so you got the gay and i like destroy it 2019 says no
considering what we just read uh 2019 does not want to give up the gay
okay did someone say die for the dawn
which would absolutely be with within the parameters of efap um i really like this one
so you got everyone's complaining about efap 59's length you've got efap 50
like you're not as sick of legs
uh you know nothing i got my rhino milk and objectivity nothing i take down a whole police
force apparently that's probably me on twitter i guess i don't know there was there was uh the
minigun was required got feet busters i'm afraid of no themes i would watch this film
no themes so rare image of tonal being sworn in uh we're able to get this thanks to a lot of
people okay yes yes the face this is the face he uses on the majority of his fucking thumbnails
what thoughts to her within his name he's very serious about this job
i've got a nice picture celebrating all of the the cast of efap i suppose even got big
idiots in there so many why am i a sexy tiger lady yeah that should be right i'm not against it
yeah i'm a sexy furry lady we can worry his gun in for that dawn cake i mean tonal cake but oh
yeah don's up there he's one of the wings of a dragon i guess that's he's one of joseph anderson's
i don't know what that means thematically but i'm not gonna stop it so tko is a thing
and this was one of the fits that was made and someone decided
yeah no context someone decided to draw up a vision of it uh themselves it's a little different
oh my goodness
so we got this turned into this i wanted that
that's so much that's amazing i wasn't expecting that and you thought it stopped
there didn't you that's what you thought so this is another shit that was made
oh
this man decided that well this person decided to cook up another image
that's actually terrifying
when you take a children's drawing
you go terrified that bottom face like
we need we need this line from ray i think shut up sheave
and then he extends his creamy tongue into her brain
so uh we actually showed this one on the meme stream which is currently locked in the pits
of hell but it was a pixelated now we've got like the the full vision so you got um how many
efaps have gone without memes and i said about four and so uh this is my meme collection at
this point it's like jeez are you serious like i assure you it'll be fine i open up and uh got us
a meme overload through the first election just saying jab jab jab jab we've got a lawful jab the
full metal jab jab strikes back chaotic jab uncompetitive i think is in there black pill
king of joker drive a video when we'll get around to it i know i suppose this is me trying to keep
track of all of my memes oh yeah we had angry jew can't forget about that i can't forget about that
um so this is like a i guess a pre-existing movie called hachiya dog's tail wags a
jeb's tail
simpre atolado yeah one awesome bros story a reality
de leotard oh yeah there we go all right which leaves us which leaves us with the main portion
and after these we will be done with the memes for now i can't believe we've gone this far i'm
going to post this and just tell you guys don't don't actually think it's real but it's wonderful
you're always welcome on efab okay yeah we'll talk about weird shit i assure you
it gets better jab held some other things to say
go outside and think about sex please please look at the retweets oh my goodness
this is like fucking more than double the retweets that there is likes
one billion retweets oh according to the sources the oracle sequence has been removed from the
film no spider oracles oh but they thought about it that's what's important yeah oh so many people
have just pm'd me this i've got like i was checking i was like oh what do all these pms are
like several people uh the the oracle scene has been removed from the film sad they want to make
sure you know this is a very sad thing that's happened um but yeah we've got um jane nixon
on joker and then jane nixon on fantastic beasts she liked fantastic beasts you know yeah she comes
for it she comes for it yeah weird comment but you know and here come the jab memes starting with a
wonderful kylo jab uh oh wow
if i told you mola was a jab build youtuber
i think a little jab the glasses yeah
so many jab memes i don't see no themes like it was just made with bbatic in the bottom left i
have no idea what that is but hey you can make memes but it kind of looks like bruce campbell in
that photo yeah he does actually
wolf loves the jab babies you see this where the trouble began that smile that damn smile
and then to make it even better everywhere i go i see his face
god as you like we've already got this far many people work hard to make these things
like that's where that's our podcast it's incredible like look at these there's just
so many jab beams should be bad and clapping of course that would upset him
poor jab better not ask people to clap anymore then we've got a a jab exe i had to show that
it's important oh that was glorious
um there's a there's a random uh major lead meme in here i i mean to order these but sometimes
it doesn't always work out you get to look at women and you get so
though suitably this is right after it this is actually a thumbnail from downward thrust
so i think now begins our selection of movies about jabs we got jabbing miss daisy summer 2020
um that is really good jebos the hands of fate oh god
you got jenny please clap what i don't even know if people have seen some of these movies
what's eating jeb at jeb they're all jeb i guess all the main characters because i mean of course
um so watch that movie i don't know if you guys saw joker but yeah it's just a screenshot
from the trailer i guess candidates of the election in case of the black jab this is
an awesome movie that came out a while back but pirates um i like how everyone else has
faces cut out but yeah the jab shank redemption
jab can hold you prisoner jab can set you free he's got jab bush and morgan jab but
morgan jab
jab can set you free this is obviously like where that the origin of that pose came from
oh i got no idea i have no idea i got no clue because it's in this one too
it is some campaign appearance uh maybe maybe the one where he's taking a sweatshirt on
reminds me of the old howard dean scream escape from planet jeb oh that's a great moment that
howard dean this was that this film didn't do too well uh if you guys remember the jab
busters 2016 movie no jab busters i was always very impressed by his work playing all of the
characters though do you like he's a perpetual shadow leslie jabs you guys you must have seen
jeb and i mad right
that was it was a powerful meme like uh there's no fucking did i uh you got that shark movie
jab
spit no expense mr and mrs jab that's a crop
the massive black poor have you ever seen the jeb bush cringe compilation on on youtube
i've seen a few he's a he's jeb man into the jeb oh everyone remembers gi jab
he's so happy he looks like a badass he looks into it
that fallen order came out uh game came out jeb fallen order i think it was yeah
yeah me and rags lended our voices to that game is uh obviously once we found out jeb
was involved we couldn't refuse absolutely just we did for free just to work alongside the great
one i love the simplicity this one i love that yes like who wouldn't go to see this
jeb and then just like fallen order the new star wars movie starring jab of course
he's a lot of the characters again he's such a versatile actor yeah i know right there's no role
he can't play excellent excellent stuff um again jiggly i don't even know if people fucking knew
this movie we got jebly jab doesn't play by the rules jeb jeb afl jab flick jib nifford lopez
or jebla i really love this one for the silhouette
yeah private jet you need to know where that image came from i really need to know where that image
came from it's like peak meme rate you guys ever see that uh that jeb brother's movie
i just thought jab brother's was really good
because of course bionicle seems to slip into a lot of our memes
mask of jab the movie hero will be revealed
i like how these all used to be the just the they were just the things we were laughing at in
text though there's so many movie posters of these if they exist oh my goodness i mean you you mean as
if they exist like it's jeb's hair well what do you even what is that movie i don't know it
it's uh i don't know it's got kevin hart and will will ferrell in it i can't i think and i can't
remember the name of it though oh you know will ferrell could play jab in a movie sometime
get hard get hard ah yeah that was one of the best bond movies jab for
i think you guys all remember the good the bad and the jab yup the good the bad and the jab
i mean you know it's a maligned film for sure but his performance was fantastic in the last jab
last jab that beard looks good on him good
i've found the origins of that image but it was someone posted it to reddit
in the donald sub uh subreddit but i don't know where the actual original yeah no the the pose
in which like he found it necessary yeah that's what i can't find where did the actual pose come
from we're fascinated with this you think you can simply find a treasure like that
oh no it is older than time
i was expecting to be beauty in the jab but i'll take it so this one this one's
a controversial film that i really thought was great for sure is yes actually
50 shades of jab
again that's not which one i thought jab would be all right well the you know controversial film
people thought that it was one of his worst roles i think it was he was exploring a part of himself
like can we not can we accept that about actors these days please you know he gave it a shot it
worked out i think you know and it led him to getting a role with the don on um that wildhogs
film or whatever it was called oh with medea and tonals of course
stop sexualizing jab wildhogs was a thing
you guys ever see uh the big jabowski the big jabowski this movie in my life right there especially
oh i need that movie in my life again just one of those really talented actors who can sort of just
absorb the role he's in i don't know this is probably one of the most impressive roles i think
he ever did uh jab with mark wolberg or jab please he looks into it you know it looks happy
leads us to uh jab pills and jenny pills you know which one's the correct pill to take
take the jab pill yeah now we've got a fucking assortment of memes
um i guess this one's jay specific
god there's so many more legs this is the uh a live depiction of us choosing what videos to cover
sometimes it's hard
it's his routine
so legends of the guardians the owls of ghoul because nickel backed at the music
so yeah wolf and rags were unaware of i guess the specifics of uh dark fate and i revealed to them
that aunty's name was karl there was just this silence for like a few 10 seconds or so it was
it was dramatic again this is like a poster version of what happened on twitter i suppose
toxic brood were right behind me so it was all right yeah that was the editor by the way i
don't know his name but um the one with the the black and white sort of image yeah the guy from
huffington post right i don't know why jeb's there i think jeb's on your side yeah jeb's
probably going to be supportive everyone has a jab we know this he's he's the uh them all this is
a pretty cool screenshot from the game alien isolation uh yeah so check out alien isolation
if you guys want android yeah it's a spooky android from alien isolation nothing else about
this image and it's pretty cool i just want to point out that i don't care that 99 of these memes
have been men the fact that you're featuring a wamen i'm so sorry you are sexist and you should
go out go outside yeah go outside and think about sex this is uh epic post the efap wars 2 attack
at the clones you got um i guess i'm against the uh the clones got a lot of the um the island man
flag floating around lots of things going on here tonaled is in the stars naturally the stars
living that cosmic life i like these memes they're fun the um efap is a leftist pop culture podcast
rags is a far right neo nazi dog whistling who will win they can't decide who which extreme i am
it's like he's on your team no he's on your team the last jet i was an enjoyable movie yeah that's
fine the lost jedi was an objectively good movie like my fucking efap axe
so this is a bat wamen meme you got brutally dispatched multiple people yeah that's fine
steals a dead person's skin and uh fucking cake goes nuts and just leveled
oh man shit rags we got that tomorrow oh my goodness you're right nothing but fun ahead
ah i'm so ready and look at this i find this meme to be inaccurate you got good morning
sunshine with efap mini heading towards bat woman bat woman is a huge hearty cow
these buckets efap is carrying on enough like that's not even close to enough
she is uh she's a she's a creamy milky uh cow she's just oh gallons
bursting at the seams gallons weekly so this is an interesting story right this meme uh you got
what white knights think you fat 59 is and it's us beating up jenny and it's like what it actually
is you've got uh tim nair angry jew i guess yeah b rags wolf jab the owls of ghoul
and uh the eight out of ten thing for j this is great um the guy who made this he posted it to
movie circle jick it's a subreddit that despises efap and they upvoted they thought it was a meme
against us oh no and like i think once it got to like 50 points or something they started to realize
they were like oh wait because what they interpreted it as was what like efap white
knights think we're doing which is like destroying jenny's opinions and what it actually is this
embarrassing nonsense like that's how they took it it's just so funny to be like that's one of our
memes guys like this is what i'm so glad that they like our memes yeah you know it just proves how
good the efap audiences are making memes talented so you got scan me i dare you the fucking the fly
reference oh god it raises too many questions i think that's talking about when i was in the
commentary saying that if you teleport somebody it raises a lot of questions like about what
you're doing to them um we got i guess tonal's pretty happy about uh winning the election again
i'm i personally i'm i vote for tonal that's just me that's his exciting face it's a really
terrifying face like what's he gonna do happy face i feel like wolf has seen this one on his stream
but uh he's sort of toted toted the blind jab um that new game uh fuck i forget what it's called
something strannic tone stranding that's a begettiest game it's got tonaled on his arm as well
the dawn is the baby
what a begettiest game oh yeah look at that that's a begettiest original good raps
um our stream was getting suspended on the meme stream and then got the dawn trying to protect it
and it came back up temporarily good shit and yeah that's proof by the way for those who don't
know the meme stream did exist it was a thing it will come back one day it's just what we're doing
right now but for like five hours it'll be like woodstock where more people claim to have been
there than we're actually yeah i like how applicable that is well with the word change
arrested for this that's uh the assassination of the dawn by the coward carol danvers
i uh don't know if you guys have seen that it's a very good film
well don was just a humble noble guy and carol did it for the for the fame it's uh
it's terrible really um we'll be missed i'll get her in the background yeah
the good the bad the dawn
and of course um don delivering presents to the orphans on christmas day i thought that
was quite i don't know how you got this picture but it's uh wonderful he's a good man
no that's absolutely a real thing that happened
um let me go this this banner of uh i guess just efab doing its thing
i'm surprised aden is displayed as not sleeping in this picture but i'll take it
i'm some fucking clothes i'm a sexy tiger girl again why i'm why do i get why i got boobs now
what have you seen this one before i'm a tall person
maybe we did see this one before you might be right oh this was on no there was no there was
one similar that had like this type sexy tiger lady in it there was like the oh yeah it's just
a we we checked out a couple of these on his twam stream oh so i don't know if you guys
checked the local news when that efab went out but you got long man bad condemned over remarks
on jenny um i can't quite this is the original highest death picture i got from them single and
loving it there there is description here is kind of hard to read out over attempts by mauler to draw
a line under his remarks that the victims of efab 59 were taking things out of context have drawn
a furious reaction from survivors and campaigners the rapper jeb bush joined
rel can any of you understand what that says
including the verified i don't know what that word is but including the verified people on twitter
who died after being attacked by the toxic brood in angrily dismissing the long man statement
uh that they should watch the stream for context the notorious leader of the toxic brood issued a
tweet saying he'd been taken out of context after daring to stream for 11 hours about
jenny's review of the joker movie quinton reviews who has previously been harassed by the brood
said mauler was an idiot whose remarks revealed how terrible it is to have to deal with efab
maul's response is too late he told the guardian we already have uh we've already seen that he is
evil and will not bother to watch his video because context doesn't matter also here's the
thing i fucking hate trump uh the justice for jenny group described the long man's streams
as appalling and jack saint called mauler's comments crass and insensitive long critique
is not deep critique the brave youtuber tweeted jeb bush who has long been a defender of jenny
after his victory in the 2020 election spoke out against mauler's response to the live stream
saying please clap yeah so yeah uh this is about the people who live stream lacking the most basic
humanity or empathy mm-hmm yeah made the front news uh but you know what can you do man they
they always spin it they always take you out of context these these rags as they say for magazines
that is amazing the detail the detail jenny where are the themes there's actually a couple
of theme images here i quite like uh this one as well you got are you afraid of the opinion hold
no i'm afraid of what's inside it the theme of joker is that you should stop taking your
medications oh no no it isn't i mean you know it's just her opinion rags what the hell
yeah it sure is i quite like this version in relation to the themes thing too
the jabs that jenny duckelson's had trying to find the themes of joker
okay it's all over uh
you know this is in reference to the good old mainstream copyright strike who would
copyright strike this stream i mean it's not like they're dying it they probably publicly
announced that they destroyed that stream but it will return at some point oh look a meme about
me talking about how you can use badges in order to teleport lots of tech in terminator
they could just you know if you can just take a badge in there what about a beaver
whatever works right whatever works um one of those wonderful big hideous memes i respect women
as representatives of femininity thus the more prettier woman is the more likely i am to defend
her it's a level i'm from big hideous i think it's very applicable uh late in the year 162 ad
it came to the attention of big hideous that a group of proles on the forum had engaged in a
conversation for 11 hours about shepherding in this conversation they had negatively reflected
on the musings of jabaya a young poetess who claimed that sheep are a type of fungus and the
wool can be curdled into cheese so roth was bigidious about these attacks on a noble woman of high
birth and fetching looks that he published a public proclamation thus it spoke imagine being
so mad at women that you talk for 78 hours about what bitches they are after posting it on the
senate door he appeared at jabaya's villa to comfort her bringing a vase of wine and some
flowers with himself well i hope it worked out for him oh yeah defending jabaya um big hideous is an
intellectual i'm not going to take it away from him yeah um this is this is like a classic i guess
the uh i'm literally starving to death i literally died when i saw your message that guilt is
literally a pig and rags is like keep using that word don't think you know what it means man's
you gotta stand for something oh yes all right just gotta oh this was like fucking the greatest
shit this meme for after all the twitter crap that happened so you got nobody panics when things go
according to plan if tomorrow i say that efap will cover brown table or that movie bob has a
take that's pure autism nobody panics because it's all a part of the plan but when i say that jenny
niggleson has a joker take that shit well then everybody loses their minds it's uh pretty much
one to one what happened we've made very long streams about a lot of people for some reason
we did it about here it was a dodo oh and this also represents that you got yep that's fine
that one yep that's fine oh look that's the one that you guys were on before i mean uh jeremy
you got uh 36 that's fine oh like they've got they should give her a crown
like
i think this is um just wanting a standard renditions of wolf and just right beginning to battle
um i can't say i know what the result is but i could guess
i guess this is a linkara gunning for efap unbeknownst to him i am on twitter so
it didn't work out yeah like i'm still quote unquote on twitter just basically as an observer
my god this is something someone found in a restaurant it's a wolf eating pizza
so they felt that they needed to tell me about it and i think that's fair
you could just picked it up and drawn something efap related and then claimed the whole thing
was yours but they didn't do that they didn't do that they could have they could have i'm not sure
what to think of this help me help me think about it oh my goodness it's it's gosh it's like a
salvador dolly painting it's so wow that is something else your existence looks painful mauler
total the total tea that's rough um so you got some 3d drawings which i guess i made with tilt
brush then uh this is me trying to take get my video away from the copyright bots but obviously
i wasn't successful completely with efap 60 um getting there and we've got um i guess you click
this one to see the uh the the parts to it but um i'm trying to remember all the context for this
so this is uh the stream official barriers of blockage angry jew dangers of a broken jeb this
has got to be episode 59 angry jew is killing um is that french french bug and then there is
a french like a fly or a spider a french someone is burning a brain box there's a lot of there's
a lot to deconstruct you a lot of themes a lot of meaning um the france
okay is that french oh the frenchman is gonna oh yeah it's a rendition of metal trying
to explain that his airplane was actually a swan in the alien game oh yeah
so guys it makes sense this way
i quite like uh this you got so massives they have opinions they have thoughts and they are long
a level five critic or you know an evolved critic does not have opinions does not have
thoughts is not long i'm representing this to my class obviously um this is just the undeniable
truth and if you notice uh on one of the windows is sort of spelling out some form of a message can
you make out what that says anybody i i don't know it'd take me it'd take a while for me to
put it together i gotta gotta translate it you see here's the thing i can read it but i can't
tell you what it says i didn't see nothing if you could write it down don't ask i'll give you i'll
give you your Epstein pass oh but that means you're gonna delete rags if you do that
the 3d art red dish of what we've just been reading about
he's just falling off the thing like goodbye kylo
in fact jesus drew all that in such a quick amount of time on this well actually funnily
enough this was drawn this was drawn before this before the stream but it's just because
he read the leaks and knows this is i got is a sign of tripping hazards
not even that could warn him um i have no idea what this was made in but a guy's made like a
a version of me i guess with um i want to say like it makes me think of car parts for a weird
reason it must be the shine but um it's like a spooky awesome badass thing a couple a couple
of versions or shots that damn smile so it looks like yeah the head the head was created in a game
and then the rest was drawn it looks like cool it's like a nice little amalgamation of the arts
yeah right there that's really cool i could be a villain boss in a game you could totally do it
okay it's neat um your boss fight would be i will i will throw kylo Ren down a pit do it
so uh this is bigidious with his book of good rat and uh Freudian be able to share what our memes
are and they spread into the ether and i assume they come right back down into efap that's how
the that's what's the that's the how it all works basically in case anyone didn't know
um
this is the uh the pixel artist but putting all of the different pixel visions together
oh cool that's desk bullshit in the bottom left i see yeah hello is there a swastika in the middle
well the problem is that could be referencing a lot of different memes actually
so there's um the isle of man was made into a swastika a couple times right that is the the
drawing one of us did on that that game little stick man it spelled out uh i think it might just
wait is it hang on is the eyes in the mouth is that the eyes in the mouth of er is er i was thinking
the same thing i was thinking the same thing oh like it's like it's er see that's er's mouth
in the middle and then like the eyes like diagonally in the opposite direction
yeah a lot of people in chat settings er there you go yeah er has become a swastika
jay's god is lightsaber i have a gun i think it's all natural like little weekend warriors smiley
face al for tear a whole bunch of recognizable casts and then the effep logo and uh i like to
go the the tgp the great british podcast guy as well as the three but there as well yeah
who's next to frugal is that robot head
yeah yeah that's robo head kind of looks like uh weekend warriors giving a thumbs up like
critiquing wolf's ass uh so this is ra is an alien i'm guessing and um oh he's a squid billy
oh yeah yeah sorry eddie's collected the uh the head of is that dale i can't remember who that
most looks i think it looks like dale rah really liked dale though so i don't know what that could
possibly be about rah likes dale yes rah loved dale 110 it was one of his favorite guests of all
time i'm not being sarcastic also this was someone drew this one jay left twitter i like this cute
jay hugs it's sad it's sad and cute you're sad yes in this picture it's sad
so apparently how i hug is to wrap my arms continuously around someone i'm sure they
don't find that terrifying it anyway the long arms just roll from i'm sorry i'm sorry the
most disturbing part about that hug that you're just like wrapping your arm
continuously around it's like a rope instead of sitting next to me you have squatted with one
i'm a longman how else how else could i possibly do it just sit sit next to whoever you're hugging
shut up jay you're happy now this is footage of you after you break on twitter
uh so i like this drawing you got um efap 55 the efap's tismic thesis congratulations i think
that's the aid in one and uh the thing is i can't specifically remember exactly what this is because
there's a lot of it i was drunk stuff but i just like the drawing a lot of that was drunk stuff
congratulations you got efap on air then um uss liberty 13 out of 50 and i'm like time for
the super chat oh god this one says old jews that okay this is from ras
ras is giving you the super chats
he's giving these ras got this look like you better read all these motherfucker
there you go i summoned ras i guess i would use ras against certain enemies it makes sense
are you saying that ras is the cosmic chicken um maybe you're addressing the cosmic chicken
and you're like i summon ras cosmic chicken then that'd be a common well this person isn't great
with uh punctuation that's the only way i can explain it jay what do you want me to do
ras you're watching confirm or deny whether or not you please give us your take on the
cosmic chicken it's a pikachu's rendition of jay getting kicked uh oh it's cute
i'm like oh
pikachu's actually made fat art well art in relation to uncompetitive god also rags is
racist the wall should have stayed god so are you fucking serious i like how look at my casual
clothing in that one i guess i'm drinking a tea very cute no support in the corner very cute uh
i have discussed the usage of both forms of the n-word with black friends on the gaming podcast
i am a panel member of and they were shocked with jay logboat and said she was a racist okay
all right
i'm sure they did and then uh i think you've seen this already jay but it's a pikachu's
rendition of you it's very cute i like it happy friendly jay all restocked after a twitter
vacation and of course we've got a christmas rags too from pikachu yay this isn't something birthday
jesus in the cold this amber you have to apply our christmas uh icons in like just over 10 days
oh my goodness oh yeah we're almost there we're getting close to getting close to jesus season
this is getting close to fuck i need to make it close to christmas icon christmassy time this is
our efap mirror verse you got the long man versus the short man the dog versus the cat
the j versus the jebby the jebby and the dawn versus the plank
well creepy ass porg the porg is terrible porg's been lobotomized please
there's so many cool things i have to save now i know it sucks so much to catalog and file
it's wonderful we have to catalog our memes i want i wanted like if epat was like a cartoon
i desperately want to see this episode where we read the parallel versions of
jeb is a harsh judge
you just did like it takes on joker what no pb8 is saying help help
but bb8 somehow like even though bb8 is normally a big ball somehow in that one bb8 looks obese
yes this is uh i think pikachu's uh take on rags meeting taxon
i'm you but a pussy
that is funny and yeah that mostly does it for the memes as far as i am currently aware
but there's always going to be more oh my goodness we got the super chats to go through
yeah unfortunately i don't think i'm going to be able to stay for those i got some
fucking work to do i was actually going to say there is there is one more meme i mean okay
rags uh what do you think holy shit oh my goodness oh my goodness damn
oh man can you show that on youtube right now i guess rags is ready i never got i never got
my monthly thrust from tonald i don't know huh are you gonna pass on that tonald
yeah who would pass on that tonald come on what are you gay
debates are i never got my monthly thrust i give him five dollars a month to get that monthly
thrust and of course i i signed up right kind of when he did his little break thingy here let me
check his patreon and see what see if there's any news i was just gonna say it's so sad that
like you would have gotten your monthly thrust if only you'd signed up earlier probably
yeah that's the thing imagine you buy like a hooker and they charge you per thrust
just depositing the pennies as you go uh i i i keep putting tone old instead of tone
like i don't even think about it old not downward
thrust here it is all right posts loading up here september 11th was his last update
um yeah it's the same one as earlier there's been no no new ones oh obviously we need to
we need to send him i need to send him this image so that he will so he'll bring it to me dude just
if you if you like tweet at him and say where's my monthly thrust it might push him into doing it
you'd be like oh no somebody's missing i mean i would tweet this to him if i could but i don't
have a twitter account here let me just do you mind like a lurking twitter account that you just
that it doesn't have your name on it no i can lurk on my old one oh i can still see everything
i just can't like comment or like or message or retweet um can i can i oh i could message him i'm
gonna message him do it uh says the dawn said no video made meme sad face um i'll try and see if i
can sort that out for the next defap the video ones i just need to cycle through them and see
which ones have copyright and which don't and then split them into two different groups so i can
essentially um do a mini for the ones with copyright and then do a non-mini for the ones
with not copyright it's gonna be great um but yeah it's just tough to get all of it in line
you know but i will say um we're we're we're essentially in a position where the we're
probably gonna be jumping into superchas now which is going it's gonna be tough for me and rags to
finish it in five hours okay um that's that's where we're at so like what i'm saying is that uh
this is the point where you are absolutely all welcome to make very adult decisions such as
doing things that involve other things in life because this has been seven hours and ten minutes
oh wow yeah i didn't actually notice too much of that myself honestly kind of flew even though my
brain is soup after those leaks oh yeah that was tough to read um so yeah second time sitting
during the second time is not funny but um i'm looking forward to the movie more and i blame
mauler for that so yeah i'm afraid so you're blaming me for having more excitement i accept
that blame wrong reasons i am gonna i'm gonna uh balance because i've got some stuff to do with
well i was gonna say we'll do we'll do them one by one so uh dash bullshit you want to
do you want to tell people where to find you before you skedaddle uh my channel's kind of uh
in stasis right now but you know you'll find me over on youtube.com slash dash bullshit i do

what i'm gonna i'm pretty tired i'm pretty sleepy yeah i fucking love jeb um well i don't know that's
what i can do now in my new place is my desk is right next to my couch and i'm pretty tired so
i'm gonna do is i'm gonna swivel my mic around so it picks up on my couch i'm just gonna lie there
and i'll probably fall asleep but i'll be on until i fall asleep and uh rags have you got
you up to anything or um i mean i'm just tired but i'll hang in there as long as i can
all right so it begins and so it begins i'm gonna go grab some supplies
i will uh i will open with the streamlabs ones and then and then i will tackle the super chat
okay so uh i missed one from when i was playing a bit of that video game on stream and it said um
molar i'd like to propose the official evolution of the critic movie bob dot dot dot
and it just says movie bob i don't know if they were gonna make a joke like movie blob
and they didn't end up spelling it that way but it just says movie bob so
i don't quite get it but i think i understood the the goal uh with it i would like to propose the
official uh critical evolutions of bob chipman movie bob film robert cinema roberto motion
picture robertson i guess the they corrected it with this stream funnily enough uh because it's
five hours late wait it was only five hours later okay it doesn't matter also where is wags wags
is back yeah i am back my uh my alarm just didn't uh didn't go off i guess the
volume had been reduced or something like that but yeah you might even say the alarm was being
a massive it was being a massive hanging on my side jeb nickels has a spider review video how did
jeb become so entrenched in the sacred lore see i don't know you can trust her review of spiders
that's my that's my controversial take if i'm being completely honest be careful with that
um i can't believe some guy made a 1.2 billion hour response to my video
bigidious bargains well i mean again we're kind of students of bigidious i don't think he'd have
a problem with it unless he's referring to someone else some other massive um you get to look at
women i don't care dude looking at women is gay if that was true that was no bullshit response
looking at women is gay gay supreme leader kylo ben at galaxy burger can i get one order of
cosmic chicken nuggets with a sith mcmuffin at galaxy burger rex since you're a fat whoa
accidentally clicked a thing rex since you're a fan of isaac asimov's foundation series you
might be interested in just right's recent video about asimov game of thrones and sociological
stories oh i don't think i will no i don't think i will i i'm not into game of thrones um not into
just right stuff that i read um i don't i just don't want to sit through a just right video i'd
rather just lay in bed and stare at the ceiling and think about it myself and that'd be more
productive i feel yeah um i uh i think theo watched it i asked theo what what he thought
i can't remember what he said but uh just ask ask ask theo for the for the take and um i'm sure that
will you'll get all your answers if you have a short synopsis you could dm me i i will i will
read that um so i looked through the comment section of the last efab and i stumbled upon
someone planning to do a video exposing wolf and his poor take on guardians of the ghoul movie
oh no i've got to defend guardians of ghoul yeah i i mean wolf will snap back guardians of ghoul
man that's that's his bread and butter that's his whole thing it's zac snider right so there's
gonna be someone out there really snider cut of guardians of ghoul oh i remember those people
who had like a block list of 100 140 youtube channels 1.2 billion like block everyone who said
shit about zac snider they didn't agree with so hey maybe if you made good films that would be a
problem oh jay you can't say that what his films are bad like why does why do people you do get your
lucky ryan just left he's like a super pro uh zac snider oh he's lucky he left we we would have
had a wall for a second there guys jay this is ryan me and rags would have just looked on
in wondrous wonderment wondrous wonderment all right now is the super chats and i've just
scrolled all the way to where they began on this stream man i i don't know if we don't make it to
the 12 hour mark depending on how many there are we'll have to do to do a second stream i don't know
i'm just let's just let's get going uh hail ryan which is um yeah fair enough if ryan was here
indeed it's from mary mayhem i believe i met mary that's one of the the members of the fandom
menace um i'm ready also mola tell metal to give me his tism i don't think you can i don't think
you can do that you can't just ask a man for his tisms like this it's a little bit fucked up uh
the first live stream in a while happy to be back war to your jabs yes happy to be back yeah we were
gone for two weeks um that was partly to do with trying to get that 60 stream sorted we were
unsuccessful in that and uh also because of the the jab jenny stuff but um good news is in that
time i managed to get tfa part three redrafted fully and i'm gonna be recording it possibly
tomorrow more days than just one because it's three hours and that means that i usually do
double takes as well as making mistakes so that's gonna be like seven hours of recording at least
spread across more than one session i imagine even though we just passed the seven hour mark
on this stream so you know maybe maybe not maybe not but yes uh things that we're back and um there
should be like no more weak gaps for efap and you'll get a bonus episode eventually with with
efap 60 with the actual 60 getting um changed into 60 whatever as time goes on anyway this is
an amazing panel hello everyone love all your channels excited for the stream oh i hope it was
a good one that i said seven hours ago also i want to read that one ahead of time j you think
spaceballs is a bad movie you have no room to talk about whether it's zach snider film or any other
film is bad you massive i'm trying why do people around me keep liking things that are bad is
zach snider make space balls i would be surprised oh my god um you're gonna piss off it he jay just
said it wouldn't surprise him if zach snider made space balls just because it's bad
i think the chattel i think the chattel take care of that yeah chattel probably take care of that
weirdly i didn't expect this we got kick j in in the chattel like i don't know
space balls is good that is that is a that is a take to have j space balls is bad i'm surprised
this is this is a movie that you're not allowed to not like did you not get the memo that probably
makes more sense than episode nine space balls yeah definitely there is much more of a narrative
um kick him now one person in the chat says hashtag ice amongst kick j kick j kick j
j has the big gay kick j kick j does have the big guy that's true why would i talk to j dude he's
got this gay just gay um anyway uh petition to remanver the chat i guess it's rename uh mauler's
right wing death squad press one to sign oh my god it would have to be mauler's right wing
leftist incel death squad you're gonna you're gonna get all of it in there um we gotta come
up with like a like a funny name the letters it's awesome hello all my jeb words hello jeb
nickels logic didn't have very strong jibber and just all of the jeb words at this point everyone's
a jeb there's got a jeb in all of us that was that's what i meant to say no he's like jesus
we can't explain all of the lore that just happened j you really expect it's just repeated
all jeez one for you have terrible taste in films yeah why would we why would we tell you
about something narrative related when you can't even understand good narratives what about that
silence jeb nickels logic didn't have very strong feelings about the movie but still shot and edited
a 33 minute video to criticize it i mean it's not like you can't do that it would just be like have
something to say well she did have something to say just wasn't very great uh my celibacy is not
involuntary what am i then uh a voluntary celibate celibate of also a volatile
no that's different in a voluntary celibate would it be v cell yeah somebody says doesn't
one have sex oh yeah they're looking for the name though v cell right celibate isn't celibate
isn't isn't celibate someone who does it intentionally like by definition
but i want to make it sound cooler with v cell v cell is cooler j it just sounds a resource
uh a celibate i mean a celibate is a noun as much as
and you celebrate your celibacy is voluntary that's why they put involuntary celibate if you
have too many bucks and you would rather have less butts and more money what do you do
you celebrate you celebrate when you celebrate
i don't know is that really you you celebrate why would you celebrate having too many but
like right rags you got his terrible joke right by definition too many of anything is bad any even
even so i wouldn't celebrate too many butts but how many butts is too many butts i don't even
think i have the answer to that and i i love me some butts all right i'm butts for days over here
wonderful like kind of smelly like kind of like you know when butts like go in the way
and like they're going away they've got like a they're a funny shape and they're like they
a funny shape i can't describe the funny shape i'm thinking of it's like a funny shape it's not
perish not not perish perish is like the ideal shape of butt
so they're like like pumpkiny and they've got those like more than one crack imagine it's like
that like the butt is significantly narrow the hips so like the the cheeks don't like the cheeks
like clamp in towards the center of the butt instead of being like nice and rounded
like deport j in the late j
because he's a flamer who doesn't understand butts um all right so this is a four parts
super chat you got okay muslet i'm heading to japan and i'm looking at a 17 hour travel day
because i'm an avid efapper i've already seen all of the faps because of this i thought i'd ask the
efap hosts you and wolf as well as a recurring guest rags and manager j what your favorite
faps are for the flight now i thought this would take care of all my free super chats but i have
an extra one now after this so do me a favor and kick j um all right all right yeah so well it
lets me it lets me check his profile i can mention him message him and i can add a note i'll add a
note to kick him later uh user volume mute invite to server show activity show on activity feed
remove friend and block no kick though well you can just do all those things i guess yeah i could
do all of those things but uh yeah so the question is what is your favorite fap i'm assuming he means
which efap episode hmm i really liked the episode 50 oh yeah episode 50 we'll get you the whole way
through yeah you could part one two and three then uh rewatch 50 yeah that could work i love that
the drunk one with eden was pretty good that was it maybe we're biased because that was just fun
for us but i haven't actually listened back to it i don't know if we sounded like idiots or not um
well i think the more fun it is for the cast the fun it will be for the listener theoretically
yes yes um uh chat what was what was some of your favorites and don't just spam random numbers
no no no no let me finish i'm gonna say i'm not going to pay attention to number ones you have
to be a number and then a dash and then a reason for the episode that's how you know the trolls
from the the the the the voles
so uh let's see the results jay
but that's that's nonsense i hate it
you know i'm still with 50 there's so that's think there's a lot of good ones that if efap
one jay wasn't in it
there actually there's actually a lot of good ones though 15 59 was one of the better ones i think
but man the 24 hour the efap anniversary one man that was 29 out
well 176 for the glorious future it represents that doesn't make sense those people are going
for 50 not so great debate that's only going to last him an hour though
aiden one was really good yeah there you go um 59 rags lost his mind true 13 the major lee video
because the video was so stupid it was incredible so here's a strong choice loud soup with jay
longbone that one was pretty good that was a good one for the best quote of all time is i think the
milking my favorite moment of all of star wars oh that's is that three that is a good one four
i think that this is four yeah that was patrick williams good old patrick
aiden one was mind melting yep well i mean fat 69 alcohol does stuff
oh yeah there you go uh there's a lot of options i think we're going with 50 is our choice
um it's my favorite man all right but there's also loads of other streams
if you type in i typed in today um to try and find the efap i typed in mauler streams a playlist of
like all of the extended extended universe streams it's got like the debates on it it's got
wolf streams it's got uh it's not got it it's not got metal streams but they should be there
they're just on a different platform oh is it just like all streams that have me in it
no it's not not all of them even have you in it that's why i thought the playlist day was kind
of weird uh it's got i swear it has like hang on oh yeah i just saw it it's got um it has to be
the stream i did by mistake before uh the stream with patrick attacks on and you got the stream
wolf did with uh fan errors in there as well oh it's even got my stream playing full and order
all right it gets updated new stuff they're probably watching the stream right now for all
i know anyway well probably anyone who's who's into the stream is enough to archive them all
and they could be asleep jay people do sleep all right oh god i thought you meant like just
watching when you say watching now isn't no i meant right now listening back on the archive
this very moment now um it's very hard to believe that a decade ends in a month and a half amazing
how culture can change for the worst in just 10 years that is kind of actually kind of crazy
yeah we're entering 2020 folks don't be fun um i look just like jenny nicolson bilbo baggins
i don't think he said that personally that's that's my i've read lord of the rings he never says it
i've read all of the harbor he never says it i've watched all of the movies he never says hello
mauler any review for the new terminator yes once i get my hands on a blue hooray though
looking at it episode nine if episode nine is anything close to what we read in those leaks
that's going to absorb a lot of my um my interests for a decent chunk of time
um hey massives this wednesday is my 21st birthday and will be getting my first ever
gaming pc and i'm beyond excited what pc games would you guys suggest i play first to test it
praise the dawn to test it out um to a good testing game um
i a good testing game hmm let me see if i i was gonna say you could probably find that out easily
online if you're looking for advice on which games that you think you should just play in
general it's like there's a whole bunch it really depends on your interests oh yeah um one good way
to find out how big the improvement is is to play a game that you used to play on console
but on your pc now yes and then you could probably see the difference that's one of
the things that i did and it was like i think battlefield three was that game for me where i
would you know i played it on console and then i got a pc and played it and it was like fuck
damn this is what this is what they've been talking about what damn people say uh oh yeah
but everything from like even a lot of old games like leopard and two is a great example
where it runs insanely well and a lot of people still play it and it still holds up pretty well
yeah so playing that on a modern like pc is wow um doom is an excellent example the 2016 doom
as well as 2016's titanfall 2 both of those are really excellent games that benefit from
being on pc quite a bit um uh go go for those give those both a shot or those three i guess
give those a shot yeah because the reason i'm stuck it's like what genres do you like what um
what pace of game this just is everything is available so go have a you have just had a
massive dare i say it world opened up to you all sorts of genres all sorts of all sorts of things
can't wait for efap 66 66 may actually line up with the star wars one way planning
um so we got we're on 60 60 now 61 next week 62 63 64 65 60 oh so 66 is currently lined up to
be on december 5th if everything goes the normal sort of way it does but if that meme stream comes
out 56 would end up being on the 29th and i believe we're planning on doing one soon after
the release so yeah it'll be close to being the one that being released on i'm not sure if we're
supposed to do something special for 66 because you know like order 66 right what are we supposed
to do what's the specialisms kill kill you you commit genocide kick all of the days j side
genocide oh and then there's episode 69 are we supposed to do something for that too i don't know
it's supposed to be hard to keep track of all this thing uh the spiders foretell salutations
ragamuffin oh my god they predicted muffin the spiders man they know what's up hello all my
boomers hello hello viva la ifap yeah that's just wonderful um the assassination of jesse james by
the jeb we actually had the assassination of the dawn by the coward captain marvel i actually quite
like that version you know cowardice jeremy has time for efap but not the high council i know that
meme and i know you'd appreciate that i'm afraid they've gone both him and ryan they they could
only stay for seven hours like doesn't have that much time for efap no not not that much time at
all is efap kid friendly maula glances nervously at rags uh no absolutely not as if i'm fucking
kid friendly you you are you're kid friendly not me though i'm a bad influence on the little
my little god on the children's and all those such i'm a bad influence i'm a bad man
maula please read this in the cutest voice you can i don't do cute voices
it's not a thing it says god is dead give it an attempt they donate it i don't do cute voice
that's that's the big gay no bullshit told me never to do that said like no bullshit i trust him
i trust him you mean mr. shit okay they've they've they've written in a way that forces me to use
partial cute language so we'll see how this goes god is dead god remains dead and we have
cued him how shall we come forward ourselves the word woes of all those word wars that's
really weird those are w's what was howiest and mightiest of all that the word has yet owned and
and bowed to death undo our knives who will wipe this word off us what war two is there for us to
queen ourselves with this is a long super chat yes uh what festive wars of atonement
what sacred games shall we have to invent it's not the greatness of this deed too great for us
must we ourselves not become god simply to a we worthy of it there we go i did it
what a nightmare hooray you did it uh my my no there was no my name is molar and i'm a dumb
massive oh no yeah you said it they've got me now that means it's true uh they cut half the old
pokemon how lazy i have heard that being a major criticism um i don't know nothing about the new
pokemon but there's like a big fight going on with a lot of people about whether or not it's garbage
or not um i hope i've heard this and that so yeah i've heard that in this so i don't play pokemon
it's not a thing i don't care for it um lol free money from youtube i'm about to leave for a
wick flight rag since molar can't receive my custom don funko pop can i send it to you
yeah you you can do you have like a p.o box or something um i do actually i i've only got it
recently so i don't have it um uh i don't have it posted anyplace if they could email me i can send
it to them oh okay yeah there you go yeah email me email me give me email what do you guys think
of star wars jedi fallen order i'm at work right now and i just got the notification my first super
chat ever love you guys uh thanks for the super chat uh if five is an average five out of ten's
average i'm kind of looking at about a six right now yeah uh from what i played i probably give
seven and then i could see myself lowering to a six after enough time of of playing the same sort
of stuff that i got already which seems to be what's going to be happening it's it's like a
i you see it's like dark souls but even i don't really i don't know it's like it wants to emulate
it but it doesn't do it really all that well i have issues with calm kind of yeah um even in
terms of like the combat movement for being a respawn game movement feels clunky and poorly
animated um i don't feel like a lot of the now i've only played it for like four hours so keep
this in mind so far this i'll be someone who played so far but i don't really like the combat it's
it doesn't have this fluidity to its animations and the motions that are made which is really
important especially in melee combat for like reading attacks and things like that knowing
when your block is done and whatnot it doesn't feel like it's responsive enough for a lot of
things um it's fine it's serviceable it hasn't frustrated me yet oh no it has yeah the octo
the first one you fucking find that two hits you um but yeah i creature yeah it's the frog thing
with the tongue and it's like the first mini boss you find and it i i don't know it's the
soul it's the whole no you have to die do it seven ten times and then you learn the pattern
and then you could kill it without getting damaged that sounds a lot like dark souls to me yeah like
that's so much fun i love that that's fun but it's okay it definitely feels like a star wars
game um i defeated that on the stream by the way by having it jump off the map and kill itself
jump off the map how'd you get it to go off the map i didn't do it on purpose
no like because you fight him in like a cave oh well i didn't fight about a cave a cave
oh no no i'm talking about like the actual mini boss you you go into a cave and he's inside the
cave oh okay i was thinking of a different frog i think with the tongue big frog with a big tongue
yeah there's the thing there's multiples you fight you can fight like three and the first one you
find for some reason the first one you find is like the mini boss and it fucks you in the asshole
and the other two are just sort of like normal ones
well the normal one gave me a funny i would show you it well my perception would be the first one
you find whichever one you find first fucks you up yeah the boss version basically yeah i was gonna
say it sounds like rag's describing something else because uh yeah it's got a health bar on the top
of the screen and it'll hit you it'll two hit you but also it has an attack that like if it hits you
with the first one you're stunned and you have to get hit by this i was playing on the hardest
difficulty so this thing too hit me anyway this grunt creature yeah the the hardest difficulty
has been punishing i'm curious if i'm going to pursue it or not as in like it depends on
knowing it maintains itself to be but um anyway uh it's just it's it's okay it's fine it's fine
maul use the power of rat to win yeah i threw that thing off a roof
um uh fuck mary kill top three porn stars according to prawn hub
i i don't know is that something they can sort by like i've got uh the my what i think i've got
like virgin media yeah um so i've got the safe um i've got the parental settings on the internet
so i can you still haven't fixed that let's go to because i can visit porn hub like
wait i thought you said you couldn't no i can visit the only thing i've encountered that it
stops me from visiting so far is efap dot me that's lame all right so the parental controls
are fine with porn hub but efap dot me that's not okay so let's go to porn stars sort by most
popular weekly can i send you a screenshot of the list or well you can probably send me it
i don't know if i can put it on stream though yeah you can't you can't put this on stream
it one of them's got a dick on it oh my goodness do i need to do a private message to both of you
or can you just delete it afterwards oh wait you know what just throw it to us but we'll get rid of
d-day cobra dust bullshit and ryan they don't have to see this okay they'll be it's fine it's
just that one of them has a uh a yummy looking dick on it so we so we have to go for a top three
okay top three um i'm gonna put riley reed up top she looks fairly young good complexion oh wait
sorry no so so out of the so one two three out of those three you gotta fuck mary kill that was the
question sorry oh oh fuck mary well kill doesn't matter i don't fucking know these people well i
don't know anything about marriage we have to base this entirely on looks i guess okay this is
entirely okay uh fuck riley reed marry um hmm i will i would marry lana roads
and i would kill mia lulu because i can't see your face wait why do you say mia lulu
leo lulu no no you don't get you have to choose mia califre is your third person to choose yeah
mia califre is the oh oh oh of the top three yeah okay i got you yeah i guess i gotta kill mia sorry
yeah i i think i agree with your takes there actually yeah um i'm gonna marry mia uh really
seems she seems pretty chill does she what makes you uh arrive at that conclusion i've seen her
interviewed you have i have really yeah
more than that i can't remember i don't care about like the distinction between the other two
they look pretty much the same to me so it's flipping wrong by the way uh decimal she was
like you removed me so i can't contribute i was just like imagine i hadn't removed the three of
them and rags just posted that i feel like i mean it's all fine except for the second one
because there's a cock on it no i know it's just that imagine they were like she's got a grab she's
got she's covering up the nipple with her hands by the way ring on her finger yeah jay what the
fuck it's probably not a wedding ring because it's the middle finger but look at those nails uh no
and hey with with riley you get the free yeah i like exactly it comes with comes with a free dude
with a yummy looking dick on it and right you've got look at the hand with the with the nails on it
you know like the pointy white nails i like my lady's hands all natural like i like the rest of
them you see i like any of that pointy nail stuff going jay defending woman i'm not a fan of the
pointy nails damn there you go i don't think she normally has that i guess you would know i don't
riley looks like she's trying to put that dick behind her ear like it's a pencil
do you not no she's just snuggling up to it because she likes it yeah she does look very happy
i know i like a happy i like a happy girl i don't like someone who's dour and down in the dumps and
they're sad or they're crying and make their eyeliner streak down their cheek no rags especially
i found what i was looking for there you go that's the timestamp just play that for a few seconds and
you can see me defeat this hard creature oh i should probably oh yeah that's not the right one
yeah well it's just a different one just watch what happens anyway all right let me watch them
you watch chat we're very happy to see this this thing ate me several times
defeated with skill hooray
did you get it oh did you get any xp for it oh well i killed it later anyway so it didn't really
matter this thing's only like a grunt so well in this thing too i barely got any xp for killing it
well yeah i mean you know it's i think it's one of those creatures where once you figure it out
it's probably quite easy to deal with most of the time especially when you level up your shit um
but yeah anyway um ephra 59 comment section the virgin white knights of jeb versus the chad legion
of ra well and blood was spilled a serbian jeb oh no do you know about a serbian film rags
a serbian film called what that's what it's called oh no i don't know no do not find out
anything about that film it is horrifying they made it just to be horrifying okay i won't look
at it then my name is maula and i'm a boomer why why are you doing this to me people
making me say such horrible things did you see eric buck's reaction to the riser skywalker trailer
um i did and you know what it was when i was uploading episode five of batwoman reaction stuff
um because metal was over here and i was downstairs like just looking at um the video ready to put
it out and then someone sent me that and i was like oh i guess i'll watch this and then and then
he he uh turned up and i was like oh let's let's watch this shit and uh i don't know how eric
butts is gonna react to all that is there anything they could do that would eric butts would be upset
with you reckon this them announcing there's not gonna be any more star wars movies you know that
poor man right there to announce there will be no more star wars announcements that would destroy
his soul like oh i couldn't i wouldn't want to do that to him that poor man if they say like if
they say it's gonna have slightly less fan wank than we thought it was then he'd be upset like
oh we're cutting fan wank you look specifically about like i need my fan wank
people wanted to kick me before guess what kind of pizza i'm eating pepperoni no that would be
that would be an answer that would that answer would not get me kicked hawaiian yes see what you
didn't grasp jay was that you'd get kicked no matter what your answer was no but like to anyone
who wasn't gonna kick me before i'm now eating the pizza that it's a meme to say is bad it's not a
meme jay it isn't i'm sorry how even even if you think it is a bad pizza which you're wrong but
even if you think that it clearly is a meme to say that it's bad like only those who like the
pizza think it's a meme probably just gonna tell me my opinion's fucking wrong and you're eating
pizza wrong how does that make you feel i'm gonna put that on a shit all right do you do you ever eat
pizza with mayonnaise no who's she who's she who's mayonnaise yeah i think i saw her on the list

there's something left over yes that oh great shitless you know thoughts on new sonic trailer
looks mad i like the sonic a lot the movie's probably like it's gonna be
probably gonna be a pretty average movie sonic looks great no i'm sorry the scenes that were
in like the first trailer the scenes that were in the first trailer the scenes that
were in the first trailer are still probably going to be in the movie you kind of cut out
again can you just say that one more time the scenes that were in the first trailer are still
all right we got we got up to still the scenes that were in the first trailer are
still probably going to be in the movie painfully unfunny comedy with like we got up to gonna be
Well, you said probably going to be in the movie.
Why am I cutting out so much?
What's the problem?
Why are you what?
Why am I cutting out so much?
Why are you cutting?
Oh, he's probably saying, why are you cutting out so much?
Oh, I'm I don't know.
People are now advocating to ban Jay.
I see. It makes sense.
Ban is the step up.
Yeah. Kicking him.
The the film still looks like it'll be bad.
It's neat that they responded to criticism.
A lot of people assume it was all planned.
I don't really think so myself, but maybe so.
The Sonic looks good.
The rest of the movie looks.
Yes. Greetings, Massives.
You actually made me watch all of the expanse.
And now I'm more excited for season four than your reaction to episode nine.
Oh, my goodness. All right.
Enjoying media is a good thing at this point,
because running out of things to do that with
also, Chris, Jen is best girl.
Also, also high jabs.
Do they mean Chris Chan?
Chris, Jen, Chris, jabs, Jenny,
Christelson, I'm not sure.
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.
Thoughts on that new game about space wizards intended for children?
Oh, we covered it.
I feel like we might get off that a few times.
Yeah. A metal streams cannon.
No, they are spinoffs
and they're going to get decanonized eventually, as far as I'm aware.
I've spoken to the producers and the managers.
They're not happy with metal streams being canon unless specifically
identified as Canada.
That's what I've been told.
My hands are tied.
But you still get to see some of your favorite characters
engaging in some bonus content.
A lot of fans consider it disrespectful.
I don't know. It's really up to you guys.
And once we sell them, once we sell the Efap rights,
then they will be officially decanonized.
It's all like alternate timeline stuff, those dreams.
Yeah, it's the multiverse.
Efap wields one one six nine.
So it's like, you know, universes like what if Spaceballs was funny?
The Efap.
Why would you reference our own world instead of one that's like not ours?
The Ecom.
That's that's that's what it comes down to.
We're just from different universes.
It's the Mandela effect version of the world where Spaceballs is just terrible.
Well, everybody's just saying it's good for the reason you've got one.
You've got no you've got a version of the world where it's good.
And I've got a version of the world where it's terrible.
Well, welcome to my world, alien J.
How do you how do you feel?
Pretty good. All right.
Make a pizza. Hi, Jay.
Hello. Kick rags.
Oh, what is this bizarro world that we've I mean, it's suitable, right?
Considering we just came from.
I lost the start.
What did I lose?
So the beginning portion was a complete recap of the Twitter thing.
And it was filled with funnies.
That's that's what was missed at the beginning.
When do we counterattack against Jeb's Legion of White Knights?
Donis Vault.
I think the counterattack was not only engaged, but highly successful.
Efap has not even suffered a scratch.
So that's neat.
Jay, did you your hand ever avenge his home, family and people?
Um, yeah.
Well, there's your answer to the brick and mochi about it.
Oh, I remember that. Yeah.
Disney buys Efap and makes you drink green milk.
I wouldn't sign up for that.
You know what would happen?
Disney buy a cannon.
And then they're like, they offer me money to come back.
And I'm like, no, no, no.
And then they're like, but rags and wolf have signed on.
And all the fans are asking you to.
I'd be like, oh, OK.
And then I do.
And then they fucking kill you both.
And like the first 10 minutes of the episode, I'm like, oh, no, the fuck.
The guy who hacked a status channel is making smug community community posts.
Jeremy, could you help the status guy get his channel back since you got hacked?
I didn't know that was happening.
Unless why would anyone hack that guy?
Because they're fucking dickholes.
As he as he pissed anyone off, doesn't he just make awesome stuff?
Like, why would you want to hack him?
Guys, set up if you if you care about an account, set up like several steps of
authentication. Oh, two step authentication is so fucking good.
Let's put on everything pretty much at this point.
It's funny, by the way, because I got a laptop recently and I signed in on it.
Fucking like my phone and my PC were freaking out.
They were like, so excited.
What the fuck? I was like, it's OK. It's OK. It's OK. It's me.
It's me. It's me. And they're like, OK.
But it's good that it does that.
It should do that.
And we got to be careful with everything these days,
because I'm pretty sure there are hackers out there that nothing will stop them.
Like. Unfortunately, but,
you know, you just do everything and kind of get it back as soon as possible.
That's the thing. They're probably not after like a hacker.
That's that good. Probably isn't after like, you know what?
I want to hack some film critics, YouTube accounts.
But I mean, I guess this is the thing, though.
If someone hacked like me or Rags, I could be like, oh, well, yeah,
if makes fucking shit, tons of really angry enemies, it doesn't surprise me.
Even though that's a retarded reality that we live in.
But the astartes guy, I don't know.
I don't know who he pissed off like.
I don't know. I think it's who knows.
It's just people just like probably just some guy who's just being a dick.
Is like, I don't know.
I guess they just think it's funny for whatever reason.
I've been made aware that your eating is is pissing off raw to a significant degree.
No, no, no, no, no, no, fucking starve.
He said, stop crunching, you fairy.
Jay, how do you respond?
Um. What are you going to do, fairy?
Damn, that's just what a fairy would say.
Wolf, Ayn Rand is not some crazy libertarian.
She's just a rational author who's sadly slandered and misunderstood.
Sorry, but it's a pet peeve of mine.
There you go.
I don't know anything. I have not read Ayn Rand's books.
I have read your four of them.
I've read The Fountainhead, Atlas, Trugged, We the Living and.
Ah, what's the other one?
Not anthem.
Into Stella Marines.
No, it was anthem.
It was. Yeah, Stella Marines.
OK, well, were they good?
Anthem Fountainhead, We the Living and Atlas, Trugged.
I'm going to go ahead and assume you liked her work in order to have read four of them's.
Rags the end cap for me.
I'm not an end cap.
I promise you that.
So what I would rather be an end cap than a communist, though.
What did you think of the books?
I liked them all.
I liked them all.
They're they're very much they're very thick with her
personal ideology, objectivism.
But as long as you kind of can go along with that idea, I think the base premise is
pretty nifty.
I think some of the characters are fairly sympathetic.
Read them a long time ago, but they're not bad books.
I was I enjoyed reading them.
She's like a hyper individualist in a lot of ways.
And I can I'm sympathetic with that to a much larger degree than I am with an
authoritarian.
So I was able to just go along with it.
Some say Joaquin Phoenix Joker is the best.
Some say Heath Ledger's Joker is the best to settle the argument.
We can say all we can all say Epstein didn't kill himself.
Yeah, we can.
Yeah, that's true.
There's no way that guy killed himself.
That movie Bob tweet about Mjolnir and Thor.
Yikes.
This person's super chatted just because they wanted to share that.
That was a bad, horrible tweet.
It's so true.
We did you get to that bit?
Right. No, that was like right at the beginning, wasn't it?
Which part?
Oh, if you if you scroll up in our group chat all the way up to the top, you should
see a tweet, a tweet from Bob of House movie, a movie of House Bob, I guess.
All right. I got to do a lot of scrolling.
Yes.
I decided to try it as well.
It's after the pep is after the drawings.
Yeah, there it is.
All right. Here we go.
Call them not cinema, if you like, but consider how the MCU has forever
claimed the only no stammer away from the pause.
That's the reaction.
That's right there.
That's the reaction.
They have claimed Thor's.
So they've taken away.
You think white nationalists give a fuck about that?
No, man, that was like the whole thing.
Remember when Hitler talked about Milnea?
If you think that that's certainly that's quite the silver lining, Bob.
Well, at least this will make it somewhat potentially maybe marginally more
difficult for white nationalists and neo-Nazis to use me all the time.
White nationalists and neo-Nazis to use Mjolnir as a symbol.
That is OK.
But if you look at his tweet's responses, like nobody fucking agrees with them.
It's like, what are you doing?
This is a weird.
What?
My favorite thing about that as well is like in the tweet, he's like, yeah,
it's going to be so great to see the hammer lifted by a Jewish woman
next to the black queer Valkyrie.
Except Valkyrie is not queer in the movies because they want to sell that
shit in China and Russia.
Yeah, you know, that's that's how they do it.
You know, loads of loads of black characters, loads of Asian characters
and no gay people.
Oh, yeah. Wait, I was going to say, wasn't we want that China money?
Wasn't there like they were kind of alluding to the idea that Valkyrie
and Thor had a thing in Ragnarok?
Yeah, that did seem to be they did have chemistry.
They had very much.
Well, there was like that moment, I think, when she gets into a new armor
and then they like give each other a bit of a look.
And it's like, oh, something might be happening here.
I don't know.
But I don't remember any details that she was.
Queer. I don't remember that being a thing.
Yeah, you know how a lot of the times they just said it in interviews.
Oh, OK. So a lot of the times we anti SJW types
have a criticism of the other of the SJW types and say
that they use diversity as a replacement for quality.
This tweet helps to encapsulate that idea.
I mean, it's movie, Bob.
Most of his team don't actually like him.
He is a crazy person.
He is. He is.
Every time this happens, though, I think back to Patrick Willems
saying that he's like the only person he approves of is like YouTube
critics that are traditional. I'm like, Patrick, what are you thinking?
Oh, no. And what if he knew about eugenics when he said that?
They must have must have met each other or talked somewhere
to the point where.
Get your story straight.
I don't know.
How did that happen? Why movie bob of all people like just right?
I can totally understand.
Like that makes total sense to me, but.
Who people I assume they've got to at least third base.
I think that's conservative, but all right.
I'm looking at a seventh base at least, maybe even 10th.
Have a free super chat. Why? Thank you more.
I'm blaming you for JJ getting the idea of bringing back Palpatine.
If episode three, you said Palpatine coming back for some reason.
Did I. Well.
The thing is, when you brainstorm with a bunch of people
on what the worst ideas are, JJ just gets light bulbs.
He's like, oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
The force goes battling with Ray to defeat Palpatine.
That's a real thing that could happen.
That's where we're at, folks.
Force ghosts fighting with Ray to beat Palpatine.
Making a piss saber and taking Luke's name.
Out of it's not a piss saber, it's a God saber.
OK, yellow and gold is cool. Cool.
Gold is cool.
When I played Jedi Knight, Jedi Academy, you bit your ass.
I went with a yellow saber.
A shit's tight.
You want to go with a lightsaber?
Yours is blue because you're a normie.
Oh, that's an angry J.
Yeah.
My shit is that my saber with yellow saber.
Tight as Riley Reeds, fucking little pussy.
Mola also predicted Kylo falling to his death.
I don't believe all of this.
There's no way we predicted all of it.
Of the comments on that.
People did not like the Kylo falling to his death thingy.
There's probably too late for them to fix that, isn't it?
Like the JJ's probably like, nobody liked it.
Oh, no, fuck. Oh, I thought it was perfect. Why?
Oh, they can change it so he like sacrifices himself to save Ray or something.
Someone else said you did.
I'm going to need a timestamp because
is it going to be some passing comment like lol
if Kylo just falls off a cliff or something like that?
It's obviously going to be that.
That's exactly the kind of joke you would make.
Wow, Jay, you think you know me so well.
See that silence proof that he doesn't.
Finn will be inconsistent.
This movie, they'll go to some force first order installation.
He actually hasn't previously been responsive for mopping.
Finn, do you know anything about this base?
He's like, I didn't bought this one.
They'll give him like a look like what the fuck.
That's how they confirm how he's still alive.
It's like, oh, yeah.
Finn's like, oh, yeah, I used to mop up his throne room.
He was there. He's fine.
He was doing a metal stream.
He said Kylo falls to his death.
So I made the tilt brush image without reading the leaks.
Oh, yeah, but that's because I heard that.
Like someone had told me that like he falls over and dies.
I didn't take it seriously.
That's why I was like joking about it or whatever.
And I think I even say in metal stream, it's like, oh, yeah,
the leaks are including stuff like Kylo falling over off a cliff
and dying or something like that.
Like I didn't know that that was the actual leak.
This is a game of Thrones all over again, seriously.
Predicted space horses.
Smudboy apparently predicted space horses.
I've heard that.
Anyway, if it takes one hour to cook a batch of cookies
and Cookie Monster has 15 ovens working 24 hours a day, every day for five years,
how does it take Cookie Monster to make six million batches of cookies?
I know what that's referencing.
Well, it's a it's like a baking thing, like with the cookies.
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.
So bake six, like how many is a batch of cookies?
I'm not sure.
Could that be millions?
I don't know. Well, I think what I think they use the
I think they ship cookies and trains.
So how many cookies can fit on a train? Right.
Like like a train car.
Just one car.
Yeah, just like one.
Like a fucking shit ton of how many how many cookies
can you cram into a boxcar?
How big are these cookies?
I don't know.
But we're going to assume that you're not taking into account like.
Like their safety or their personal health or personal space.
If the cookies could even understand such a concept.
Mm hmm. Yeah.
And these cookies, they're being cooked. Yeah.
Yeah. To a degree that they're still just fine.
They're not destroyed.
Yeah, they're fine.
Yeah, they're not like broken up or anything like that.
They haven't you haven't been like slapped in an oven or.
Well, since I'm not a chef, how can I possibly answer this?
They haven't been baked, you know.
Because I don't know. I don't know.
I just have to go by what other people say.
Oh, yeah, that's actually would be my position on this question.
I would ask a chef. Yeah.
I would ask whoever was there when such a thing would have happened.
Yeah, I don't fucking know.
Oh, what I want to know is why people want this many cookies.
That's my question doesn't mean you counted them.
Huh, what being having been there at the time
doesn't mean you counted the cookie. Right.
But I would probably I'm saying I wasn't there.
So as a result, I haven't I wasn't there.
And I haven't done a lot of research myself.
I generally whenever the whenever the baking question pops up to be cute,
I just kind of defer to what experts say.
And, you know, I I trust that they are they're fairly accurate, you know.
Yeah, I don't feel like they'd want to mislead me about, you know,
cookies being baked. Yeah, I'll be fucked up.
Oi, Morley, when are you going to make an unbridled praise
for your favorite MCU movie, Iron Man three?
I will make a video for that one day. It'll happen.
It's on a list.
The list is getting larger and larger as time goes on
because I can't seem to catch up with my own list, but it's going to happen.
Also, Hi, Rex.
Hey, says you best boy. Oh, you.
Oh, that's nice of you to say that. Thank you.
If Twam is Efap Cannon, does that make my name Steve?
Twam? I don't know.
I don't know if this I don't know, since Rags isn't even aware of it.
I don't know if you can call it Cannon yet.
Twam, tell me tell me of this, Twam.
It's it's it's Jay.
It's our manager's show.
There have not been three episodes of Twam in which
me and people's look at things were sent on Twitter.
It's an acronym for Twitter was a massive.
And he asks Twitter questions.
Yeah, Twitter was a massive.
Yeah, it is. It is.
It is. But yeah, yeah.
We'll have to ask the manager if he thinks it's Cannon. Yeah.
Someone's telling me.
Someone is telling me that the cookie experts are cookies themselves.
Now, that's the case.
Then that that brings that's that's interesting.
The food. Hmm.
I don't know if that would skew data or if they would be like
so sympathetic to cookies that I've never met a sentient cookie.
Surely some of the experts are cookies and some of them aren't.
Now, I guess I imagine.
But I mean, surely, see, not all of them can be.
I don't really like think about whether or not someone's a cookie.
Like, I don't and I don't really think to ask, but, you know,
maybe if they're a cookie first or if they're.
If there was, you know, if they're like a white chocolate cookie first
or if they're just a cookie first, if that's true.
You have to ask about it.
I like that we don't.
That's not even an inside joke because if I've seen it now, like, oh, man.
Thank you.
No bullshit. Yeah, like intimately familiar with cookies.
He he gave us a winner in that set.
Thank you, Sitch, as well, for organizing that stream.
Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
That was amazing. That was magical.
Feel complete.
The things George Lucas defends.
Midichlorians, Jar Jar, CGI dancing frogs, sand is bad.
Harn shooting second.
Things he does not defend. The original cut.
All right, then.
I mean, this is all right.
There's a bazillion cuts at this point, as far as I'm aware.
All right.
Closer Look made a video criticizing Far From Home.
That doesn't surprise me.
He a lot of people didn't like Far From Home, from what I gathered.
He thought it was fine.
I was pretty good.
I thought it was good.
I'd go as far as saying that.
Yeah, there was one as good as homecoming, though.
What was? No, I agree with that.
Oh, wow.
His his video is called How to Make Spider-Man Boring.
What? Really?
Yeah. All the complaints. No.
Yeah. Oh, and he's got 88 percent closer.
Look, don't make us cover you again.
I don't want to do this to you.
You are nice, but
maybe we can have him on and we can cover his video with him.
Do you think you'd do that?
Is that a Fort again?
A special privilege you wouldn't allow to anyone else?
Well, no, I mean, just because that would be fun.
Oh, yeah, I'm fine with it. Sure.
We could be the first time we ever do that and see what happens.
Yeah, maybe you can earn special privileges by being a knight.
I don't even feel like go back on everything you said or feel.
Well, yeah, so I'll check that video out.
The fact that his own fan base seemed to have some issue with it is interesting.
Do you know I kind of if I told you guys, I don't remember he said this on stream,
but I spoke to him a day after he came on the stream
because he was still a little bit upset with some of the stuff that was said.
I wanted to like smooth it out.
I've also said to him that I'm happy to do.
He said he wouldn't want to do a fat, but he wouldn't mind
doing movies at some point just to sort of rip into a funny movie and stuff.
And I was like, yeah, that's cool.
All right. But he said the biggest difference
between him and and sort of us on a fat was that he looks at movies
like a writer and we look at it like the audience.
Well, that was my reaction.
So like that's not true at all, though.
No, it's not true at all, because the funny thing is that you're dealing
with Fringy Wolf and myself, who are all very invested in the idea
of actually writing stories at certain points in some way, shape or form.
Some of us, I say this is where Wolf is currently writing and editing
his own fucking book, as far as I'm aware.
He's released a book at one point.
And you'll find that it's backwards.
Well, I I don't like the the dichotomy I don't.
Looking at something as a writer versus an audience.
And he was in an audience, not like recognize shitty writing.
I can't remember how he explained it, but it was lots bad characters.
Conveniences and contrivances like the audience can notice all of these.
Well, this is the thing we are when we watch the movie.
Surely he's the audience, too.
No, he is. He has ascended as a critic.
Um.
Oh, my. I'm sorry, I've been getting distracted reading some of these responses.
I'll give you this is the first line of one of them.
I believe you missed the mark on this one by a lot.
Dammit, man, we have so many takes to cover.
I actually the next he was already planned in my head and the one after that.
So depending on what he says, you get for you and your plans.
No, plans are stupid.
This one can just go on like the the the the back log.
Where the back log is horrifying.
Like, oh, no, it's it's this enormous blob.
We were supposed to get through a whole bunch of them on 50.
We got through seven.
Hey, seven's a lot. Seven is a lot free.
Seven actually is quite a bit.
Can you believe I will say this, you know, once once Star Wars hits, man,
it's going to be it's over.
We can't cover anything else was going to be so many takes to cover.
All right. Well, yeah, like I said, I'll check it out.
I'll see what he says, and then maybe I'll talk to him
and see if he's up for watching it live with us.
That'll be I want to bring Fringy on for that one.
Fringy loves Far From Home.
We'll have we'll have and then me and Rags, I guess,
we'll try and be the mediators.
You know, we'll be the nice ones.
We'll be like, hey, look, you're wrong.
That'll be our mediation.
If he makes comment, comic based arguments, get Birdman on.
I seriously doubt he will.
I have a feeling he's what a weird title, man.
How to make Spider-Man boring.
Like of all the problems you can have with Far From Home, boring.
That's not what I would have thought.
I certainly wasn't bored at all.
I watched it three times.
Besides, isn't it boring?
Isn't that a complaint an audience would make?
It is.
No, writer would say that.
It's boring and criticism that a writer would make.
Bum, bum, bum.
Something the audience would say.
I have a theory.
How strange.
How how the tables have turned.
I have a theory.
There is evidence to suggest Aristotle didn't really exist historically.
I propose he was actually big idiots the whole time
and kept it a secret so that the Pafes sophists wouldn't know his true identity.
You're only fucking realizing this now.
Yeah, we can't we can't just we can't talk about this.
OK, sure.
What a crazy idea you just had.
Interesting stuff.
Yes, you couldn't possibly happen.
Interesting idea.
You get boned by a real fairy.
What creature is it?
A real furry.
Am I having the choice here?
Does the real fairy mean like an animal or does it mean like
one of those creepy things from cats?
It means. Oh, no.
Well, I mean, one of the things they're underneath the umbrella of furry.
So you could choose it if you wanted to.
Oh, no, I mean.
Like what?
Like they're basically he's our furry daddy.
Can I can I not just have a person like no, this?
No, the question is that you got to get boned by your daddy.
Who is it?
Then I generally will defer to Cass from Legends of Zelda.
He is a daddy.
However, there are many correct answers, many correct answers.
But that's that's up to you to to decide upon.
So you guys discuss it amongst yourselves.
And I'm curious to see what you'll say.
My mind is blanking on like any furry character.
You know, you say that, but I don't believe you.
Well, give me some fur.
Give you a furry character.
Yeah. All right.
Richard, the lion hearted from the only one I can think of is Brian Griffin.
Oh, my God.
Why Brian Griffin?
Brian Griffin, I think.
I don't know. Does he qualify?
I guess he's under the spell of somewhere.
He's yeah, he's probably related to that in some way.
So this is Sonic in chat.
So.
Brian, why did you choose?
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
I didn't choose Brian.
I'm saying your brain chose Brian.
Oh, yeah, I could just pick rags.
Oh, there you go. Yeah. All right.
So, Jay, what do you got? Brian.
Fuck it. I'll go with Brian.
No, you can't know Brian's a dog.
I guess I'm a dog too, but yeah, human dog.
Mm hmm.
I think it is a valid choice of the only one I can think of that.
No, that's not true.
What about Robin Hood from the Disney movie?
I'm not saying that you have.
Oh, my God. Damn it, Jay.
What the fuck, right?
This is Jay. You're talking to me.
Yeah, but Jesus Christ.
OK, how about Zootopia?
Have you seen that?
I have seen that.
There you go. All of the characters.
There you go.
Fucking Zootopia.
What is it?
Is it like the chief of police, like a big ass water buffalo?
Pick him. I bet he's got a big old dick.
Sure. I'll go for that.
Why not?
Bongo Bongo.
Chief, big, big, big guy.
All right. Chief Bongo.
It autofills.
He's played like Idris Elver, is he not?
Oh, fuck, yeah.
Oh, there's like a line all of it.
And the stripper tigers are in there, too.
Man, you got a fucking gold mine with Zootopia.
I don't remember the stripper tigers,
but they sound pretty.
Yeah, they're pretty great.
Anyway, remember, as I said, there are many right answers.
Remember when Mola didn't believe the leaks in the first five minutes of Dark
Fate? Oh, such innocence.
When you when Nudronic told me that John Connor just gets killed,
I was like, no, like, no, no, that can't be.
That's not a thing.
They wouldn't do that.
No company would be that stupid.
And then you know, oh.
Stupid, disrespectful, embarrassing, nightmarish.
There's a lot of different ways to really go into it, and they did them all.
We all proclaim the right to dawn diligent duties,
delivering dismay and disquiet to the dawn's detractors,
a dazzling delight, the dazzling, delightful day to you, darlings.
Also, high regs.
Hey, what's up?
Excellent alliteration.
If you could insert the dawn, Jeb Nichols.
I'd love to.
Is it can't wait, is it consonants or alliteration?
Alliteration, isn't it?
Consonants is.
Let's see, recurrence of similar sounds, especially consonants in close proximity.
Yeah, I think alliteration.
Let me double check.
Preachers alliteration, it's alliteration, alliteration,
same letter or sound at the beginning of a Jason or so.
They actually both fit. Interesting.
We learn today. We do.
I wonder if Chad going to fight over that as well.
They can fight. It's both. It's actually both.
We all oh yeah, if you could insert the dawn,
Jeb Nichols and Luke Skywalker in place, in place of any characters in TLJ,
which would you choose?
I like how it says if you could replace any of the characters
with Luke Skywalker in TLJ like he's not even in it.
All right, so say the question one more time.
We got the dawn is one of your selections,
Jeb Nichols and Luke Skywalker.
You can place them in place of anyone in TLJ.
So I'm going to go ahead and knock out Jake Skywalker and put Luke there instead.
Yeah, much better than have actually been.
Then he's still got to have been like I'm assuming the question
means we replace the characters like the characters themselves.
This means this changes the story.
If that character gets replaced with Luke Skywalker,
then basically the whole film changes, doesn't it?
Yes, it does.
And then we will have.
Wish we put the dawn.
We should the dawn.
The dawn should replace Admiral Holdo.
I don't know, man. I might replace Ray with the dawn.
The dawn finds Luke and they work together.
I don't know, man. I want to see it.
Yeah, two forces of actual good.
And then Jeb Nichols will be replacing Snoke, I guess.
Yeah.
And like, I wouldn't care about vendors ready to irrationally defend their leader.
I will admit the getting rid of Holdo for the dawn would be a great choice.
But man, do I want to see the dawn and Luke hanging out.
Don and Luke. Oh, geez.
They would not be stopped.
You know what?
They would find out that the whole ship was destroyed with Holdo on it.
And then Luke will be like, I could sense that they were all traitors.
It's OK.
It's just us two now.
And we're going to dominate.
We're going to we're going to fuck everything up.
It's going to be great.
There'll be a trilogy just for those two.
Would love to see you and POTN cover Buffy takes.
I there's not someone actually directed me to what they said
was the only negative Buffy take they could find.
And it's like this guy who has like a webcam and he's ranting for about 20
minutes about how Buffy sucks.
And it looks like it was made like 10 years ago.
So not a lot we can have.
We have to work with in both the sections of Buffy praise and and ripping apart.
But yeah, it would be fun.
What about people praising the stuff that's supposed to be really bad?
Oh, like in Buffy?
Yeah, I mean, it would be kind of awkward to sort of separate it out.
And then the problem with Buffy is very hyper specific.
A lot of people in this chat won't have any idea what we're talking about.
I know rags obviously won't and you wouldn't and Wolf Wolf would.
But, you know, it could work.
Maybe maybe it's one of those.
It would be in the the backlog selection of maybes.
You know, hello, says that Buffy is just a knockoff of Planet of the Apes.
Yes, yes, yes, it is.
Why would anyone say this?
I had no idea.
Buffy fucking tore everything out of Planet of the Apes.
It's it's true.
I had no idea.
Hello, Mowb Shlubi. Hi, rag.
Hey, hello.
Jay is also here.
Just say hi.
And that's all I've got to say about that.
So I really like the Mandalorian, but it needs to pick up in terms of story
or to lose my dressing blessing.
It's a bit bland.
Elorian.
Oh, so yeah, we we meant to talk about that.
I completely forgot.
I guess seen the first two episodes.
The first one I liked quite a bit.
The second one was still not bad.
It bit slower, more of a kind of more of a filler episode.
I would call it slower.
And there were there were what was it was like two tisms, maybe three.
I can't remember.
One of the tisms was
the knife that kills the enormous monster.
It was like, well, it's a little I ain't buying that.
They should have done so.
And then there's
I guess this one's up for debate, I guess.
But like the whole he gets electrocuted off the sandcrawler
and they didn't do anything about that.
The showers.
I was like, oh, surely they would like be like, oh, we beat him.
Now let's go scabbing because he's wearing like real expensive armor, right?
Or at least stuff that's worth quite a bit.
And if you've got him knocked out, I don't know.
Yeah, maybe they were just too afraid or they didn't know if he was.
Yeah, there's there's wiggle room there.
I'll agree to that. And then we go.
And I get like there was I was thinking about, you know,
so, you know, they strip his ship and then they give him all this stuff back.
I guess they really did include every last thing he needed
to be able to be space ready.
Like, yeah, I guess to me, it seems a little guy with them.
Yeah, like there's this reason they have a guy with them
and it took them like days to do. Yeah.
But yeah, the second episode was was weaker than the first for me,
but I'm still up for it.
I'm absolutely still interested. Yeah.
Also, I guess they didn't really care about like the six jaw
is he just disintegrate?
Oh, that was the other thing.
Yeah, I didn't really believe that they would give up
all of that technology for an egg, which was essentially like a nice drink for them.
That maybe it has some sort of weird cultural significance.
I don't know.
Yeah, I mean, you'd think they'd be able to get it themselves.
They had those like the army of blastery electric things.
I guess those just don't work on the creature, you know.
No, I guess not.
All right. That's yeah.
We'll see. I think I'll be better able to judge it once we get more episodes.
Episode. But we shall see.
My friend is going to be mildly shook when he sees I'm watching this live.
Oh, mildly shook.
Utterly shook. Why? Why is that?
Are you going to shake him?
Maybe his friend is a long man, but I don't know.
I hope your friend's not a long man.
Maybe the friends with Jodie Nichols.
Oh, no. Why, though?
Like what what what actual value is there in her commentary?
How could you say that?
Just because she's a girl like as like with her as a person.
Like they know that.
Oh, maybe. Oh, yeah, maybe.
Terrifying, a terrifying thought.
That's what I just said. Yep. Terrifying. Terrifying.
Terrifying thought.
Do any of the Aussie guests live in New South Wales?
If so, did one of their ancestors steal from one of yours,
therefore landing them in prison colony in New South Wales?
If so, you have claims to all of their belongings.
Oh, well, I guess I'll look into it off on that man.
Yeah, definitely. Free stuff.
Jay, they could do so good social commentary if lol.
No, they're Hollywood holes.
They can't do any social commentary.
They're biologically incapable of ever ever gleaning insights of any way.
Oh, Jay, did we tell you were there for this, right?
I think it was me, Jay, Fringy and Wolf.
We were talking about Ra's interest in referring to certain kinds
of people's holes, that being wannons.
So we were sort of talking about it.
And Wolf was like, what a weird thing to call somebody.
Like, what does that even mean?
We were like, wait, do you not follow?
And he was like, what do you mean?
It's like, do you know why he's saying that?
He was just like, well, like a hole in a person.
Like, why?
He thought it was you thought it was trying to get past YouTube's filter
and he was trying to say, yeah, he thought it was supposed to be hoes.
And I'm sure he would have.
And yeah, it was when we when we like explained it to him, he was like, oh,
Wolf is innocent.
Um. Oh, more people like Bob are too fat to feel anything, too fat to feel.
This is all been blacked out.
Also, read and watch Jojo.
It's miles better than the current sludge that is Western comics.
I'm sure that's the case.
Too fat to feel like when you get to a certain fatness,
your nerves just all die off because they're like an album.
Too fat to do fat to feel an album by Bob Chipman.
Being fat is I don't think Bob Chippen thinks he's fat.
He thinks he's just superior via mass.
I think he's superior via math.
I wanted to tweet that out.
Superior.
I want him to be sent a T-shirt that just says period.
Thank you, Massives, for another great stream for the video.
Who wears a shirt that says this is what the Uber mensch looks like?
Found a video about everything critics got wrong about TLJ by Count Jacula.
But when they say critics, they mean people bashing it.
It's pure criticism.
Why do I imagine that it's going to say stuff like
Luke's character was totally in line with what we've known the whole time
called him a boy.
He called him a boy.
Oh, this video does exist.
That's why Kylo Ren killed the Emperor. Wait, what?
Oh, it's like a vlog.
A vlog?
Yes, like an hour long vlog called Everything Critics Got Wrong About Stars.
I don't want to watch that.
Maybe not.
Anyway, episode nine leak.
Ray travels into the MCU to kill Infinity War Thanos,
take his gauntlet, dust everything pre-Disney across all media and become God.
Oh, tell you what, she would she would in some respect from a lot of people.
Oh, yeah, that was the thing, by the way.
I guess the time travel thing from Red Lion Media is out.
That whole theory with the how.
I guess the idea was that Ray was going to go back in time and Kylo, I think.
I don't know. But if the leaks are to be believed,
I don't think they do in time travel, which, by the way, fuck it.
Throw it in. Just just throw it in.
Do it every time travel back to before there was anything.
She floats in space and she is the universe.
She gets pregnant at the end of the film and travels back in.
And then births the universe.
Yeah, that would be a really great ending to seal the Skywalker saga.
She becomes it's a very graphic birth scene.
Do you get it? Do you catch that, by the way?
That was the cosmic chicken.
This film is going for the whole like Skywalker saga,
because up to this point, it was always about blood.
But ultimately, if you feel you're a Skywalker, you are.
Yeah. All right, then.
Sure, that's how it works.
It's like it's it's.
Don't be confident in who you are.
Just fucking be someone else.
If you want the message to be, it doesn't matter what your lineage.
Then why would she adopt loose Skywalker as a name?
Exactly.
It wouldn't make more sense for them to be like, hey, what's your name?
But she just goes, Ray, Ray, just Ray, Ray, just Ray.
Honestly, I actually think I would have less criticism for that ending.
It would be what would you mean?
Honestly, yeah, obviously look better.
Well, they said that you criticizing a woman.
They set up the fuck.
No, no, I would do that.
They said like they said, that's a great place to subvert it is like the
well, no, they don't even need to set up really, do they?
They just need to say that at the end.
Well, if you have it at one point in the film that they ask here and she goes,
Ray, she thinks for a while, then she doesn't quite answer.
And then at the end, she also doesn't answer, but it's a confident no answer
after she knows she's a Palpatine with that with that we've seen as her
like because we're thinking of this in contract.
No, it should be earlier on.
She calls herself Ray Skywalker.
And like, she's proud of that.
And she's like, look at me taking this cool name.
And then the end of the movie, the payload, that's not what you should do.
Yeah, she doesn't need to be related to someone cool to be a good character.
And that's her journey.
If she just says, oh, I'm just Ray, then it's not really.
Well, if you remember, by the way,
Hello Greedo has a video called
Ray's Parents and Nobodies, and I like that.
So so many people have that.
Imagine how unhappy Major Lee.
Oh, no, there's no kissing scene for Kylo and Ray.
They don't even touch hands.
Yeah, I don't even think they touch hands.
Oh, my God.
He does watch that shit.
Yeah, that's true.
Major Lee is going to be like, oh, my God, fourth base.
Fourth base.
Home run.
Oh, it's going to be so funny to see the cottage once episode nine comes out.
The video essay cottage.
Oh, wait, wait.
It's going to be disappointed because he was really like he was like
the only person who predicted that Ray's parents were going to be nobodies.
And now she's a Palpatine.
Oh, you know, no one important.
Oh, you're right.
He was so proud of his prediction.
That's not even right.
His prediction is fucking like he's going to fucking like disown this movie.
He's going to hate it.
And. Imagine how upset Jenny's fanboys will be when they discover
she is already in a committed relationship with her porgs.
Yeah, I mean, you know, not going to be able to beat the porgs for comfort.
Right. You can just jump right in as Jeb showed us.
A piece of porgs that come.
Oh, what up, my massives?
First time catching your life.
Hope you guys.
Fantastic piece.
First time catching your life.
Hope you guys have been keeping those jabs watered.
Absolutely.
Always water your job.
Would you rather sacrifice your significant other to save your mother
or sacrifice your father to save your significant other?
Sincerely, Mr. Massive.
Sacrifice, I don't have a significant other.
So the problem with this, I need a lot more variables, like a lot more
because it's a theoretical significant of a other.
Are they like, oh, not a fun decision to make for sure.
If it's like if we're talking the best possible
love of your life, married kids, the whole nine yards.
And you have to choose between them or
your mother or father, then
no, whether or not you would kill your significant other to save your mother
or kill your father to save your significant other.
Was that it? Yeah, one more time.
So sacrifice the significant other to save a mother.
Sacrifice your father to save the significant other.
Sort of a strange selection, but
this is the thing.
Like you're dealing with someone's got to die in these scenarios.
See, yeah, I would sacrifice my father to save my significant.
I would want to talk it through with the person.
I think my dad is probably the kind of person
that he he takes it for like someone younger.
Yeah, I feel like my dad would be like, just take me like.
Yeah, I feel like my dad would, too.
I do think that, yeah.
You know, yeah, like it would it would be, you know,
harrowing.
It would be harrowing, but like I certainly I don't know.
There's a part of me that kind of understands that
if my mother had to live with that kind of guilt.
Right. That you're assuming we're assuming that they know.
Right. If they didn't, if they if this is a choice, like gun to your head,
sudden choice, no one's allowed to talk to anyone about anything.
It would probably I mean, this is the thing.
Someone has to die in this scenario.
So I would still take comfort in the knowledge that if my dad did know
what was going on, he would he would probably he would die.
He would be dying essentially for his grandkids to save his grandkids mom.
And yeah, it would be awful to have to explain this to everybody,
but that that's that would be the grim reality, I suppose.
Imagine caring what those kind of people hate or think
those kinds of people think.
I'm assuming they're referring to all the Twitter stuff.
I imagine 12 hours of bashing that ego.
I feel like I want to make a meme of that scene from Goodfellas,
where Billy Bats has a meeting with Henry and the guys.
I mean, you theoretically could write theoretically could be
where the pagan supremacy, Ooga Booga, lulls.
Oh, my. Oh, hello.
More was great seeing you at winter's end this Friday.
Thanks for the great content and memes.
Also, hi, Jay. Hi, Rags.
Hi. Oh, hello, Jay.
My voice is fixed up there.
Oh, you should add Star Wars only to the list of guests.
Star Wars only.
I'm guessing that's a channel.
What does he talk about?
I have no idea.
Probably only whatever that is.
What is only is that like an anime?
I think it's an album, like one out one song.
Oh, the song only on the album only.
Yeah, he just talks about that.
Yeah, that's fair enough.
I mean, it's a good song.
You can talk about it forever.
Really? There's a lot of ways to talk about, you know,
we're still talking about another brick in the wall.
Fallen order so bad that Wolf quit Star Wars on Twitter.
He quit Star Wars.
I mean, I don't know if it's that bad.
I mean, I like I said, I'm pretty comfortable calling it a six out of 10.
But then again, it's only based on four hours.
So maybe it gets better.
Maybe it gets worse. I don't know.
I don't know.
This is a tweet from Wolf from one hour ago.
So me and my friend were talking about the movie
where Gary Oldman plays a midget and how amazing that is.
But instead, they should have cast a true midget.
And I thought about casting a baby midget,
which made me think of midget fetuses, which would be a good bad name.
Also, I'm high baby.
Baby fetuses.
Midget fetuses.
Midget fetuses.
Well, I guess I'll you know.
Hmm. Interesting.
Yeah, I'm just looking for a tweet to do with.
Oh, he's fun to have on Twitter, and I'm sad that he's going to get
knocked off it soon because of his his tendency to to meme hard.
Well, has he insisted on continuing to say?
I don't know. I don't I don't think he likes to be censored.
So you'll probably say it until he's knocked off.
And you'll be like, that's the he's going to be censored.
That's whatever he does.
He's going to be censored on Twitter.
So what is this?
There's a tweet that says 1945.
That is the length of time before there is a female speaking role
in the first episode of The Mandalorian.
OK, this is such a lot we see.
Oh, no, I couldn't always put my finger on why I like so much,
but that might just that just might be it.
That's probably it. Yeah, that's probably it.
Those don't family up unless the men have their Star Wars.
When two cities in Japan were nuked.
What 1945?
Oh, OK. That's the that's the correlation.
It happened because a woman spoke. Oh,
it happened because a woman ate a fucking apple if the stories are true, so.
Oh, yeah, that's true, actually.
Well, it's crazy how like I was thinking of Pandora's box.
It's like crazy how those two stories, you know, you know Pandora Pandora's box.
Oh, I didn't know you guys were close.
Close enough to access your box, apparently. Jesus.
I'm not going to acknowledge this.
I mean, you know, go on.
What about tell us about Pandora's box?
Go on, then.
Well, it's it's just funny that they're similar stories.
It's like, oh, everything was cool.
Then this woman came along, unleashed all evil into the world.
Well, it wasn't done maliciously.
Besides, it had to be somebody is going to Jay, it's going to be somebody.
Yeah. Might as well be a woman.
Oh, it makes the most sense.
Would you agree, Jay?
I'm just saying it.
I mean, from an objective perspective, it is it is more realistic.
Can you justify that?
Yeah, women are fucking retarded.
OK, I've got it on good authority that women are gay.
I've got a good authority that holes are gay.
Now women are great.
Dude, I hate debates, debates are a little.
Fallen order so bad that Wolf quit.
Oh, yeah, I read that movie.
Blob is the ice cream falling off the cone into sand on the beach of the Internet.
All right. Subhuman blob of jetty jelly.
And he smells. How do you know he smells?
Well, to be fair, I look at I can smell movie Bob when I see a picture of him.
So you can't teach me.
You can't smell pictures.
A picture of movie, but not with that attitude.
Listen, he looks like he I could.
Hmm. Just by looking at him, I can catch the whiff coming off.
You can smell that a mile away.
I know. I like it.
Listen, I'm a doggo.
I got a nose for these things.
I wouldn't get within 30 feet of that human.
Well, like how can you be sure he's a human?
Regardless, he's the he's the uber man near me, near him.
You might want to eugenics.
You might want to eugenics you.
Do you not think that you're up up to snuff to live in Bob's perfect world?
I'm not sure what Bob's perfect standards would be.
And I have no idea if I.
Probably not, because I'm not I'm not much like Bob.
And I think he thinks he's pretty great.
I he thinks he's the fucking tits, man.
He thinks he's got a few of those.
He's saying you.
He thinks the sun.
So many say, I mean,
it's difficult to count them, Jay, if you see the creature.
I've got more tits than he does.
True, but he has many, but mine are nice.
Jeb Nichols block me because I made fun of her because of her tweet.
So sad right now. Oh, well, well, if you make fun of people,
then they might block you.
You'll be fine.
You don't want to be antagonistic.
You just want to be, you know.
You know, so I mean, like, you know, some shackles for your opinion.
Also, kick Jay. Yeah, Jay, what the fuck?
Jay, what the fuck?
You can't even be part of film Robert's perfect world. Mm hmm.
How can you be our friend if you're not good enough?
See, me and Rags passed his test.
Oh, what was his test?
Well, if you couldn't pass it, then we can't reveal it to you.
Otherwise, you'll have the answers.
Yeah, it's like the it's like Harry Potter and the quiz or a weird fucking test game.
He sort of cut you off there.
It is suddenly you said Harry Potter and the quiz.
That was the film.
Yeah, sounds intense.
This is like Harry Potter and the the magic goblet cup is the quiz.
Goblet of Fire.
And you can't tell people if you find out like the next game gallons,
you can't tell other people.
Yes, you can.
No, you can't.
Harry Potter is the only book in the no.
Harry Potter is the only book in the world.
Therefore, we have to abide by its rules.
No, that's not the rules of Harry Potter.
Like Harry specifically goes and tells Cedric what the next challenge.
I know he breaks the rules doing it.
Yeah, he breaks the rule.
He's breaking. He's breaking them all.
He's breaking the rules.
He wants to keep it quiet because he doesn't want his competition.
Oh, like to have the advantage over him.
What does what does does he think that they're all like standing behind him?
No, no, I'm not saying he keeps it quiet.
I'm not saying he's like quiet literally.
Listen, I need to keep it harsh when you turbo virgins in the chat.
I need you to back me up on Harry.
Yeah, and he shouldn't have.
Cedric, Cedric tells Harry after Harry tells Cedric.
It's not a bad place for Cedric gives him a clue.
It's such a shitty clue as well.
It's just like almost like the books aren't actually that good.
But I, you know,
I will say the movies controversial opinion.
The movies are better than the books.
Do you can get over with them quicker?
They've got so many cliches in them
as the turbo istivergence rags is right.
Yeah, Cedric the entertainer.
Yeah, he was a sparkly vampire man, wasn't it?
Is that Robert Patten?
There's that joke from
Mitchell and Webb, whatever, where they're like
that there's just never any special Hufflepuffs outside of that one guy who died.
Hey, man, take one from the team.
How self conceded do you have to be
to assume that an 11 hour podcast is all about you?
Clearly got a parched jab.
Uh oh, spaghetti.
Well, sometimes I mean, people will look at this one and be like, wow,
they spend 12 hours looking at the leaks for Star Wars.
I assume you like correct to Mundo.
Absolutely. That's all we did.
We got a gay old time.
And I got my ass dropped.
So, yeah, what about that?
Jeb Nichols fans be madder than Richard Spencer.
And maybe well done Slytherin, however.
That's funny.
If you laughed at it, it means it was funny.
Yeah, that's by definition.
It's subjective.
Yeah, Privet Mine Comrades, Heil Gebler.
Yes, it.
ADL lists Thor's hammer as used by some white supremacist gangs.
But it's also ridiculous to think that a Marvel movie would reclaim the symbol.
Also, it's just a it could be just a hammer.
Is that is that a serious symbol?
Like a hammer is a symbol.
It doesn't have to be Mjolnir.
It could just be a fucking hammer because hammers are weapons.
It is a thing.
I read it on the Wikipedia page.
All right, then.
What is it being used by white supremacists, Mjolnir specifically?
OK, it just ignore them.
Rags, that doesn't work.
They'll spread.
We have to we have to put a spotlight on them and say, no, you're naughty.
It's like, see some white white nationalists are using Pepe.
That means no one can remember the OK symbol that was taken away from us.
No, yeah, I was happy that people were using Mjolnir white supremacists.
In the name of the dawn, Jeb Nichols and the cosmic chicken blessed this
against the massives seen his dark materials yet never read.
But like so far, I have not, I'm afraid.
I would have the book so excited to watch it.
Wait, what books?
The dark materials, his dark materials,
the based on the like the Golden Compass shit, right?
Oh, I've not got like a used.
I've not started the show yet, so the book, the book dark materials.
No, the show, his dark materials is based on
the Golden Monkey, the subtle knife and the Northern Lights.
Nothing subtle about a knife.
The Golden Monkey?
Yeah, I believe that's what it's called.
I've not read it.
I thought it was the Golden Compass.
No, the Golden Compass is the movie, which is terrible.
How dare you? Liam Neeson was in that.
Can I what if that isn't there a big polar bear in it?
Yes. Why don't you have that big, big ass polar bear?
Fuck you. Yeah, there you go.
Yeah, that could be your just a human bear.
I think it comes under the umbrella like we agreed.
Is it like can it talk and speak?
Is it sentient? I'm pretty sure it can speak.
I went with tiger strippers and I'm I'm happy with my decision.
I mean, I would be too. That's fair enough.
Yeah, I won't dissuade you.
They're, you know, tiger strippers.
All right.
Giving gas masks a bad rep is my thing.
Fair enough. Mola, why hate women when you can look at women?
See, I don't think that's a dichotomy.
You can do that. Why not? Why not both?
Can you give a hateful glare?
Yeah, you can get a hateful yet lusty gaze towards the women.
Hmm. Would you guys say Joker is your favorite film of the year?
Yes. So far, yeah.
Well, when I'm sorry, episode nine, of course.
Yeah, I'll be the favorite.
Obviously, that'll be our favorite.
Mola slash panel.
Do you have an interest in becoming a writer for movies
or working in the writing process in some way?
If not, no, if not, why?
And if you are, what has your experience been so far?
Any advice? So go ahead.
Well, I was going to say that, like, I have an interest in writing stories,
but honestly, not too interested in doing anything mainstream
because of the amount of restrictions that would probably come with it.
As in if I was to be a screenplay writer
and not the director slash producer slash editor,
then my work is going to get destroyed more than likely,
at the very least, changed significantly.
And that's not even necessarily out of malice or anything.
That's just people doing their thing.
So I probably want all of those jobs.
And then at that point, I'd be like, oh, fucking hell, do I want all of these jobs?
This is insane. So the closest I'd probably get to it is making
I guess what you'd call indie films out of scripts I'd write.
And I wouldn't mind writing some stories, maybe a book, whatever.
But mainstream movie, doubtful
because there's going to be a lot less of meat in it.
And that wouldn't let us do the shit we want to do.
Probably. Yeah.
Which would be Lamesauce.
What are you guys right now?
That was pretty much going to be my answer.
Yeah, I would I would probably want to do like animated stuff.
So you don't have the restrictions that normally come with a budget here.
Jay wants to make anime.
Yes, anime. Not Hentai.
Well, I mean, that's implied. All right.
I have an upper respiratory infection that's kicking my butt.
It sucks, but at least if have is always here to help a poor sick.
He's a sick man. You bet.
Yeah, you got it. You get sick better.
This will be another 12 hour stream.
Probably. We're at nine now, which means we got 10, 11.
We got three hours to get through the rest of these.
Oh, my goodness. Can can we do it?
I'm going to go ahead and say it's going to be a close one.
Probably. I don't know.
It depends on how how in depth these questions are going to get or not.
You know, it's really up to them.
Jenny's White Knights have 0% chance of wooing her,
yet they still have more of a chance than Quintin does.
Oh, Quintin's got less than zero. Damn.
Not a movie. We're talking about a trilogy.
I'm not 100% sure what that was a response.
Two or referencing, I'm afraid. But yes, true.
The jebby nickels defenders reaction to episode 59 is nearly as disappointing as Jay.
Well, thank goodness it didn't get to that level, huh?
Ifap now officially not cringe.
Yeah, we've gotten the stamp of approval from cringe mods.
So how about that, guys? We did it. Yay.
Long live the toxic brood.
Long live, sir. Long may they reign.
Trying to harass people for criticizing people you like.
That ain't cringe, bro. That's pathetic.
Yeah, you'd think that there'd be some kind of irony for them.
Be like, these guys go after this person.
Let's all dog pile these people like, well, that's a slur.
Oh, shit. Sorry about that.
Yeah, got to respect my co-host. I'm so sorry.
And I'm not one to turn down a good dog.
But I feel like it's a little bit a rhino milk toast to Ryan kennel.
Kick J. Oh, very well. And yeah, thanks.
Every frame a pill.
Is that for when we all need medication?
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
Wham in a gay.
Yeah, that's true.
From what I understand. Yeah.
Yeah, that's women, lesbians, same thing.
So you got Jenny.
Mm. Someone make the 12 hours video about me.
Ah, we we we. Me.
No, you stupid bitch.
You wish you were Stacey,
you fetal alcohol faced Pillsbury,
dough bodied Michelin, ma'am, bro.
That is right. Yes.
Even through some emotes in there of like a confused face.
He was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wow, getting artsy.
Hey, Mola, Linkara blocked me from his Twitter account
after I took the screenshots I sent you
about why he was blocking people.
Yeah, so I guess I didn't give all of the information
with the link, our thing.
So after he blocked me,
he made like a big Twitter thread talking about how he was like,
oh, apparently I misrepresented somebody less less.
I guess I'll announce now that, yes,
I didn't watch all of the 12 hour video
because I'm not going to do that.
Like a whole sarcastic round about how, yeah,
I guess he's in the wrong, but not really.
And then I don't know, I guess time passed
and he unblocked me.
And then I did a thread explaining
why what's happened is really lame.
And then he was like, okay, my bad.
So it still worked out.
It's just that there was a bit of dickishness,
you know, here and there, which is fine.
Every super chat is an ordeal,
hyphens, commas, lack of spaces between emojis and words.
I've legit lost track of all the things
that get super chatted, censored.
Oh yeah, it's, I imagine it's an adventure
if you actually want to say some edgy stuff,
you got to get like, you got to get creative.
Twitter needs to get thrown off a roof.
Well, yeah.
I mean, I still have like, do you,
how often do you use Facebook, either of you?
Oh, I guess I'm...
I use Facebook to talk to friends and that's it.
I don't use it for like, it's feed.
Yeah, I guess I kind of do that as well.
I was just going to say like, Twitter and Facebook,
it's kind of interesting to compare them
because like, scanning through Twitter
is something I don't mind doing,
but Facebook is like a nightmare.
Well, Facebook is full of shit.
And it's interesting how they evolved that way
because Facebook is still doing great, right?
Like in terms of users.
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe.
All right, anyway.
It sucks being born a clown.
I think that was supposed to be clown, but yes.
I'm literally the most toxic man in chat every Efap.
I'm Arab, which means I am semitic.
So if they criticize Efap for toxicity,
they're being anti-semitic.
All right, automatic shield.
Shawshank Redemption is just the prison movie.
Oh, right.
This was about how people referring to Joker
as the clown movie, like as if to sort of insult it.
And it's just like, yeah,
you can do this with any movie ever.
Just do this, just do a nice and sarcastic voice
and you'll be fine.
I have internalized ableism, cripples are lame.
Oh my goodness.
That's true.
Efap is just a massive movie.
I mean, yeah, we've got character arcs.
We've got set up some payoffs.
We've got what you could call different vistas.
We have different villains.
We've got seasons.
It's more of a series really, isn't it?
No, no, I think it's a big movie.
I mean, Efap is one of those few things
where if you were told,
oh, hey, there's gonna be a new Efap
and it's gonna be feature length.
Everyone would be like, is that it?
Yeah, they'd be disappointed.
They'd be like feature length.
And you go, no, no, no, feature length.
If you look at the top, it says times five.
You're like, oh, I guess that's all right.
Law, law.
You pronounce those the same, Welshman.
Yes, I do.
I don't say law and lore.
Law, law, law, law in Britain land.
We say law and law.
Law, law, it will.
Why did you throw that in there?
Yes, so the breaking the law
and establishing the law.
Breaking the law, breaking the law.
Rex, did you hear the guy who made a status
got his channel hacked?
I did hear that.
Yeah, from a different super chat, actually.
But yes.
Yeah, it's weird, it's a fucking asshole.
See, the super chats have set up some payoffs.
So how my favorite alt-right leftist incels?
Doing great.
Doing great.
Still wondering what our political stances are,
but other than that, fantabulous.
Can't wait for someone to tell us.
We'll get there eventually.
Have you guys seen T4S DBZ abridged series?
And would you guys ever do a review
or watch together on it?
I have no idea what that is.
And since it's Dragon Ball Z abridged.
DBZ, I don't know anything about DBZ.
I've got no idea.
That's the Goku man.
See, me and Rex.
And there's a dragon named Piccolo.
Me and Rex watch quality shows like Batwoman.
We don't interest ourselves on this DBZ stuff.
No clue about your fucking, your orchestra show
with your piccolos and your oboes and your, I don't know.
Oh.
Also, I use the last of my money on this super chat.
Oh, why thank you.
Hey, Rags, when is your next video coming out?
Probably gonna be a little bit
because I'm working on a big project
and it's gonna might be the longest video I ever make
by the time I'm done with it.
My God.
There's gonna be something else.
I'll try, I'll do dog bites stuff.
I got two dog bites videos that are done actually
and rendered.
I just need to upload them.
So I'll get those put up tomorrow.
Can we have an awkward Jay becomes evil again?
Jay?
No, that would be pretty.
Kind of feel kind of like regressive though, wouldn't it?
Yeah, I feel like people will be like,
oh, they've done this before.
They're just doing the fucking reverse.
We'll have to figure it out.
Our writing team has been great so far,
but I do feel like they might be running out of steam.
Gonna have to poke them.
What is a time travel episode where we go back to?
We watch an old Efap.
Is that what you're suggesting?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
So like the Efap crew back to maybe like 2016 or 17.
And then we all Jay, one old evil Jay
and there's like a battle episode.
That's bullshit said he can come back on
and fucking raw has been like,
Hey baller, that's bullshit can come on.
Rod, do you like this bullshit?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I know he doesn't like you Jay.
You're like, what one might say
as a disgusting person to him, I guess.
Except my feet.
Jay is a hole.
I wonder if raw likes Brian.
No.
Efap in time.
I'm calling it now.
Rod does not like bra.
Oh.
Rod is not like bras.
Brian.
No bras for raw.
Why do you do that with your thingy?
Why can't you be consistent?
Oh, he's talking about the icon, I guess.
Char would make really good.
Oh, mine.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I forgot to change it back.
Well, too late now.
I don't care anymore.
Char would make great furry daddies.
Yeah, that's what, yeah.
So I should put a little water bottle on his head
and just kind of rebrand, probably good.
Yeah, no, go for it.
Yeah, here we go.
I'm rebranded now boys.
Better than a person.
I know persons are boring.
I like how Rags said raw hates bras.
Raw said braless better, yes.
Braless is better.
I'm glad we've had this conversation.
I don't disagree.
You disagree?
I won't disagree.
Oh, okay.
Can we have an arc away?
Oh, wait, I read that one.
I'm sorry.
I just wanted to make sure that you knew
that there are people advocating for you being evil, Jay.
All right.
Would you consider watching first episodes
or two from the other CW shows
as a comparison to Batwoman?
I don't know how much of a Pandora's box
we want to open there.
How much we gonna delve?
We just watch the CW for the rest of our lives.
All right, I hope I'm falling currently
into the sleepy sloops.
So I'm just gonna drop out at this point.
Do you want to plug yourself, Jay?
Or are you too tired?
I do great, amazing work.
It's all really good.
Yeah, it's great.
Go watch it.
Let's delve and plug.
Jay, they don't know where you do it.
On my channel, goodbye.
What is your channel?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Jay's channel can be found at nobullshit,
N-O-B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T.
I like saying Quentin reviews instead.
Ha ha ha ha.
There you go.
I'll even put a little the don.
There's a link.
If you guys want to check out Jay's channel,
assuming you haven't yet.
All right, back to Da Super Chats.
Hello, efap gang.
I've been watching every stream since the Major Lee incident
and I love this style of content.
Thank you all for your hard work.
No problemo.
Consonant incident.
I think we all do.
That was a thing that happened.
Oh yeah, like the Twitter thing, right?
Oh no, I'm assuming he's referring to the debate.
Just yeah, the debate.
It was, yeah, that was fun times.
I still think that was fun times.
H-bombing guy reminds me of a prostitute's breath
after blowing a fat man.
Oh my.
Oh my goodness.
It smells like cock and it's nasty sweaty.
Jay Ebs...
His nose is gonna be bumping up against his gut.
Jay Epstein did not kill himself.
Big Bo Jebbins.
Big Bo Jebbins.
You hear Batwoman's already on the chopping block?
So I've heard...
Yeah, I guess he's not gonna make it past the first season.
I mean, I'm okay with this.
Honestly, I feel like it's a win-win, right?
So if there's only one season,
that means 22-ish episodes of efap minis
covering that shit.
That's fine.
If we get a season two, fucking,
I love the idea that we take a break
and then we all collect back to check out more Batwoman.
Like, that'll be fun.
But if not, fuck it, you know,
there'll be other stuff we can check out.
It's fine.
That thing being financially successful,
probably an insult to existence, just as a whole.
So, you know, if it goes down, so be it.
This is, you know, we'll get over it, it's fine.
Rags, take me down to Brown Town
with your prehensile power piston.
Boy, we're going to Pound Town, boys.
A senior White House official has said
that Donald Trump screened Joker for guests,
including family, friends, and some staff.
It is reported that Trump liked the film.
Hello, base department.
Oh, he's Nazi confirmed.
I didn't, that's interesting.
Imagine seeing Joker in the fucking White House with Trump.
That'd be such a bizarre experience,
you'd be like, yeah, all right, let's do it.
I know, that'd be crazy.
You gonna cover Eric Butz's final Star Wars trailer reaction?
If he had one of my amazing Trump stakes,
the finest stakes that have ever been made,
possibly of all time.
So, I have not intended to cover Eric Butz on here ever again.
There was just that one that was amazing, where he cries.
But yeah, you know what?
Good for him, you do you, Eric Butz.
At least somebody's getting something out of these films
in a positive, happy enjoyment.
That sort of way, we'll be laughing.
Like, we'll be having fun too, but you know.
Yeah, but I'm telling you,
when your wife's boyfriend's kid is born
and you don't cry that much, you're gonna be in trouble.
Yeah, she's gonna be upset.
And what if the kid says something like,
it sounds like a noise, but it sounds kind of like force.
Would he be like, oh my God, oh my goodness.
A limerick, there was once a man from Beijing
who penetrated Rags Ring.
He released all his lust.
In one monthly thrust, Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself.
Ha, ha, ha, I like that.
I just felt the okay sign right there too.
I like that, that was really good.
Something I love about Efap is that Ra didn't die a villain,
but instead lived long enough to see himself become a hero.
It broke the dark night, that's what Ra did.
I believe it.
No one bad mouths our Lord Ra, knives out.
I think he'd be roof's out, but yeah, yeah.
Here's one of my free super chats, Longman.
Why, thank you, there's a lot of those going around.
I guess this is to do with YouTube Red, is it, or something?
You get free super chats every once in a while?
I don't exactly know.
Yeah, I think every month or so,
you either get like two or five dollars just free
to just throw at somebody.
I actually threw mine at you guys earlier while I was out.
Neat.
Yeah, so you'll see me down there somewhere.
Wolf mentions saving Private Ryan from time to time.
I wonder what you guys think of Fury.
We'd love to see you guys look at war movies
from time to time.
Also, Hi Rags.
Hey, I haven't seen Fury.
I liked it, but then I think, I can't remember,
there was a lot of criticisms of it
that I didn't quite think about,
and a lot of accuracy issues I've heard about.
Also, it doesn't hold a candle to save in Private Ryan,
but that's not even fair, because nobody does.
They spell saving Private Ryan as Ryan, like Ryan Johnson.
Don't do that.
I have to wonder if that was intentional.
Maybe they've just seen the name Ryan Johnson too much.
First time getting you live, watching some single digits.
I forgot which, probably won't catch you saying this,
but Hi Rags, and I'll listen to this later with some milk.
There you go.
Well, to your future self, enjoy your milk.
Jenny was used to seeing no-brainer Marvel movies.
I mean, she covers mostly everything from what I can tell,
and I don't know what it takes on the Marvel movies
where for all I know she didn't like them,
or at least maybe, I don't know.
And she didn't like Rogue One, and she did like TLJ,
and she didn't like Suicide Squad,
and she didn't like Joker.
There's this selection there that's like,
ooh, all right, this is strange.
But yeah, whatever works for you.
That works, so we'll have to listen later.
I love you guys.
All right, also Hi Rags.
Hey.
And Mauler is the alien this time.
DNA scan him.
No.
Jenny should watch out.
She'll be kicked out in the SJW crowd
for being too white.
Too white.
Too white.
I'm offended.
How could you cut out Ra and his rooftops?
Wait, who cut out Ra and his rooftops?
Seriously, if ever there's like a-
That's a hate crime.
You know like an Efap, but like League of Legends
style game?
I think it was Mober, I guess, yeah.
Like Ra would totally be a character,
his ulti would be throwing a rooftop down the lane.
It would just roll all the way down,
and anyone who's hit by it is like picked up
and thrown off, that sort of thing.
I can picture it.
Always a good day when Efap is life.
Most Sundays is essentially the plan,
but I'm not gonna keep to that.
I told everybody it was gonna be Thursday,
that didn't happen.
Yeah, I couldn't do Thursday,
and then like we couldn't do like Saturday.
We really shuffled this one around this time around.
I think we've been consistent now still,
because if we ignore all of that,
then we've been doing Sundays for a long time now.
Yeah, it's a good time.
Which, yeah, because most people start at work
then on a Monday, and so,
well I was actually gonna say,
it wouldn't really work for the Monday.
Tuesday would be fine,
because the Efap would be up on Mula by then.
So, it is that.
You should put the link to the cut version
in the description slash pinned comment of Efap58 too,
makes it easy to find it.
I mean, well this is the thing,
if you're watching Efap50,
wait, you mean Efap59 I think,
then you don't need the cut version,
and so it's in this one,
because this is the sort of recap coverage,
and so if anyone's interested,
they can check out the cut version.
I figure that makes more sense.
Anybody who's-
Do you prefer your faps cut or uncut?
Yeah, that's a good question.
Because I don't really have a preference.
Each one of them,
they're kind of special in their own way.
Yeah, whenever someone cuts a fap,
you can often find that some stuff that's important is gone,
but then some stuff that maybe you didn't need is gone
if you do cut it.
So, it's a complicated question, you know, right?
There's pros and cons, I think, to a degree,
but often it comes down to preference.
That is my extended take on that subject.
Oh yeah.
No wids, no wids.
That is a super chat.
All right, no wids.
No wids.
Anyone who won't sit through a whole efap is a tism.
Yeah, it makes sense to me.
That's pretty much just logic, right?
That's as basic as like mathematics at that point.
Yeah, you know, two plus two tism.
Long man bad.
A profile called Emperor Donald has super chatted F.
So, yeah.
Oh, well, F.
That's what you just posted.
It's funny.
Several minutes of makeup.
I like Niko too.
Yeah.
He's in Tropic Thunder as well.
He's, what's he called?
Four Leaf Tayback, the phony NAM survivor dude.
Rags, I'm already a long man.
I'm not sure what that's referring to,
but at least we've gotten now
to the portion of super chats where Rags is back.
So, we know we're coming along quite well.
Rags, I still poop with my door open,
waiting for you to look you in the eyes as I do.
My demands have not been met.
We'll look each other in the eyes as it drops.
Yeah, I figured that was gonna happen sometime back.
As it drops, the incredible tension.
I think something else is being dropped in this scenario.
So, is Kylo Ren, does he get to watch?
He's gonna make a plorp sound more than likely.
I don't know what that's gonna look like.
The J, I've lost the wolf.
I've lost you feel it too.
The J, the J I've lost, the wolf I've lost,
you feel it too?
I don't quite get it.
I'm not certain.
Well, now I'm lost too.
Mm-hmm.
Thanks for playing my Long Man Bad video on stream.
Glad you enjoyed it.
Oh, was that the one we saw last week?
It was only like two minutes long.
This one, oh, it could be.
This one's from this, I think he means this stream.
Oh.
Oh, the one where he said
that was the first time he's ever edited, right?
Yeah, that's him, that's Scruffy Pump.
No, maybe, oh, I think it is.
I could check, he's got a channel.
Yeah, double check real quick.
Oh, yeah, it is, it is, that's the one.
The one that does the fun recap.
Yeah, dude, that video was a lot of fun.
Yeah, that was great, I really enjoyed that.
Good stuff.
Glad you enjoyed it.
Hope to get better at editing and make more.
Read Berserk, you massive.
I think Wolf reads it, does that count?
It's the sub that, Wolf will read it and report back.
Me and Rags will totally read it at some point, right Rags?
I think so, there you go.
Hi, Rags, you filthy leftist.
Morla equals filthy Welsh supremacist.
Yeah, I mean, you know, what can you do?
E-Fam is both.
That's a dirty bedroom talk,
just someone calling me a filthy leftist, pat me.
I mean, that's what they get turned on by, I don't know.
E-Fam is both alt-right and now true leftists.
Congratulations on reaching apex moderate status.
We did it, everyone, don't be praised.
Apex moderate, we are true alt centrists.
Yeah.
Jeb Grand Red Sun will rise again, absolutely.
No BS is a piece of shit and Adam Friended
is a porch atheist, Jordan Peterson Kiss Ass
who doesn't have the balls to debate nightmare fuel.
Porch atheist?
Yeah, porch atheist, Jordan Peterson Kiss Ass, all right.
I don't know anything about Adam Friended.
Yeah, I don't know.
No nightmare fuel, but I will agree
that no bullshit is a piece of shit.
Not a controversial take.
Let me look that up, porch atheist.
Porch atheist.
Porch atheist.
A similar to porch dick, a porch atheist is a person
who sits on their porch and yells at you
just to let you know what's up.
The difference, however, is that porch atheists
try to educate you from their porch.
All right.
Yeah, okay.
What, what, okay.
Okay.
I ain't coming to your church.
Uh, Mueller, I just reread Discworld series sequentially
and I'm amazed no one ever called out J.K. Rowling
for borrowing from Sir Pratchett, thoughts?
I've not read Discworld, I'm afraid.
I'm only very, I'm familiar, I'm aware of Discworld,
but I know basically nothing about it.
Yeah, I mean, if that's true,
sounds like some video potential there
to compare and contrast.
Speaking of video potential,
there was that super chat earlier
that said something about DVZ abridged.
It's funny, but it's not really EFAT material, I would say.
Anyway, I figured I'd jump on that real quick.
I love EFAT because it supports my political opinions,
which are fuck politics.
Aw, wonderful.
Well, being, not doing politics is politics.
Haven't you heard?
That's a political position to not do politics, so.
It is a political position to be apolitical.
So is the Mandalorian any good?
I think it's, give that first episode a shot,
see what you think.
I was talking to Jay about it and I was just like,
honestly, having it start with just, no, Jay hasn't seen it.
Having it start with-
So Mandalorian's actually good?
Yeah.
I mean, so far I think it's worth seeing.
I can't speak to the whole thing yet.
There's only been two episodes
and one of them is very short, so.
Okay, well, anywhere I can see it?
Like, Disney Plus.
Disney Plus.
And nowhere else.
We wouldn't even suggest that you attempt to find it
at any other location.
Okay, all right, I get you.
But yeah, I was saying to Jay that it was really refreshing
to have the, it's just a guy.
You follow a guy to Bar.
He gets, he turns on his bounty hunter,
he's getting his bounty, takes the bounty in.
That's the first 10 minutes and it's so focused to me
that it's just like, oh, it doesn't have to be enormous.
It's so nice.
The fucking story about 10 planets and fucking armies
and explosions and death stars.
It's just a guy.
A guy trying to make his way in the universe.
Like, oh, thank Christ.
Like, it's weird how much that's a bit wanting,
something like that, but hey.
Are you guys excited for Rian Johnson's Knives Out?
No.
That's a big no.
Though there is a plan to, once it's out,
we're gonna do an E-Fap movies
with Critical Drinker, apparently.
That's the idea.
Oh, no.
No idea if it'll come out in a way that's worthwhile,
but I will, that movie's out soon, isn't it?
I remember somebody saying it was coming out in November.
Or is it December?
Knives Out, release date.
Doi.
29th of November.
So 11 days.
Huh.
All right, then.
Yeah, I don't know what to expect, man.
Could be garbage, could be okay.
I doubt it'll be great.
Watch it be like, brilliant.
Ripper Rooney, if that's the case.
E-Fap is now officially an alt-right communist show,
perfectly balanced.
Also, you should watch 1978's Lord of the Rings cartoon
with Wolf and Jay.
Bonjour, rag.
Hello, and I would like to watch that.
We could.
Let's see why not.
Is that the Ralph Bakshi one?
I think so.
That was strange.
I remember seeing that as a kid.
It is strange.
Like in a classroom.
But there's some stuff people feel that was better in that
than the set of films,
but more things are better in the main films.
I thought about that.
Just a bit of throwback to Mola's Last Jedi.
Luke memes and then leaves.
That's the quote that got me.
I'm already looking forward to E-Fap
about the rise of Skywalker more than the movie itself.
Fuck, I kind of remember the context of Luke memes
and then leaves.
I think, was I just referring to the fact
that he's an asshole?
Cause that would make sense.
Notices le bulge.
French furries be like, oh, but these these
and notices le bulge.
Disney remake of BFG, big friendly giant midget.
I think we need some clarification on what is
and is not SJW.
Well, oh man.
So if you break it up, social justice warrior.
So you're just fighting for social justice, right?
That would make you a social justice warrior.
It seems to me that like,
just the central point of contention is the people
that get offended on behalf of everyone else.
And that's just kind of...
Yeah, cause they're like, that's an injustice.
And you're like, why?
It's like socially, you should be nicer to these people
or something like that.
And so they're fighting for that.
Yeah, this offends them.
And then when they say, this doesn't offend me,
they're all like, well, you're not real then.
There's a bit of SJW in everybody, I imagine,
to some degree.
But then they exist in the extremes
on both sides of the political aisle.
I think we probably agree with that too.
And it's interesting what brings it out of people, I guess.
That'll be my conclusion.
But yeah, just break up the woods.
Have a look at how people are using it for the most part.
It can be tough though,
cause as far as I can tell,
no bullshit would probably say we're SJWs.
I don't know if he would.
Pretty sure he would.
I don't know what he would reference, you know?
He wouldn't.
He just would.
He'd just say it and call it a day.
You see how he reacted to PSA Stitch?
He'll just call it a day.
You fucking exploded when...
He did.
That was really something.
He was getting pissed at the guy
who wasn't saying that his wife was...
It was amazing, isn't it?
He detected it as an insult to his wife
when it was highlighting how his wife should be defended.
He is like, what am I doing to debate?
Oh yeah, go on the offensive.
You mentioned my wife.
Fuck you, dude.
Don't bring my wife into this.
Yeah, I'll give you fucking talking about my wife.
When in that video, he says about Destiny
that he's a deadbeat dad who doesn't love his kid.
It's just like, okay, seems fair.
How could you not know the producer of Efap?
Well, I was actually...
I think that was when we were looking at...
Oh man, are we actually at that point now?
We're looking at the IMDb page.
We're getting there.
Wait, that was...
We have to be as good as the Lord of the...
I was about to say that that's before
we even touched the leaks.
So maybe that's not actually that far into the stream.
But yeah, I was looking for James Moore as a producer.
Rhino Man Bad?
Fair enough.
Rhino Man?
I don't know who Rhino Man is, but maybe that's Jay.
Yeah.
And there I was, casually debating a movie
with random people on the internet,
then suddenly I'm gay.
Damn.
You didn't ask for this.
Watch Jojo Rabbit, you massive.
Seriously, though, it's a movie
that isn't being talked about enough,
and Disney tried to throttle it.
Really?
I mean, I'm not against watching it.
It looks like a fun premise.
I would love to watch it.
It looks like fun.
It looks like a fun movie.
I'm out of the loop.
Is that recent?
Yes, it's Tika Waititi's new movie
about a kid who has Hitler's imaginary friend.
Oh, right.
I did see a preview for that a while back.
That does actually seem pretty interesting.
No bullshit master debater.
He's special.
All right.
Very special.
Hey Rags, how orgy debates have you had?
I'm sorry.
Huh?
How orgy debates have I had?
I mean, that's one-to-one what it says.
Hey Rags, how orgy debates have you had?
Wow.
All I can imagine is you saying
how many debates have you had, because-
And then like autocorrect, like completely-
Autocorrect changed many to orgy.
Not many.
I don't really do debates, honestly.
I don't know.
Nor have I debated the topics of orgy's.
I would take the pro position though.
Yeah.
I'm pro orgy.
And then he follows up with a super chat saying debate milk.
Debate milk.
What would the topic be?
I don't know.
No, maybe it's debate someone about milk.
And pro milk.
Yes or no?
Yeah, yes.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go with yes.
Yeah, milk is really good.
I enjoy milk.
I think that milk is good.
Yeah, and it goes with a lot of things.
And I don't like them putting chemicals in my debates.
They're turned the friggin' log but gay.
Turn chemicals in the milk.
That's a super chat.
I like it.
Brooks is a legit ree-ree.
He is ree-ree.
Yes.
Which one of you first mauler, long or man?
You have to choose.
I'm sorry.
It has to be long.
Gotcha.
All right.
The long comes before my humanity.
Yeah.
New petition.
Rename the chat mauler's big gay Jewish right wing
death squad.
Press one or give milk to sign.
We're gonna keep pushing it.
I guess we'll have to see what chat thinks.
Palpatine, the art of camp by full fat videos.
Oh, that's a video I guess.
Palpatine, the art of camp.
Really?
I don't know if I'd describe Palpatine as campy.
I don't wouldn't either.
He's eccentric.
I think he's outwardly sinister.
Yeah, like he's kind of one of those like,
a lot of people describe him as like, you know,
two dimensional evil and he's just,
or one dimensional evil, whichever.
And he's just like, oh, I'm just bad
for the sake of being bad, but people still like him.
And like, there's not a lot of villains
that can really get away with that.
And he does it well, he's got a plan.
He knows what he wants.
He wants power.
He wants to kill the bad man.
He comes up with plans.
He tricks them.
He wants to pit people against each other.
And he seems to really love being bad.
Oh yeah, he rebels in it.
Not to be confused with rebels in it.
Right.
He doesn't do that.
You're a rebel even after you won.
He doesn't, he doesn't rebels in it.
Someone has actually made movie Bob or Nazi.
And you get quotes to choose whether or not
it was movie Bob or Nazi.
And the first one is,
I'll never forgive the troglodytes who stole the future.
I earned to prolong their worthless existence.
Was that movie Bob or a Nazi?
That's, that one, Bob, I remember that.
I remember that tweet.
That's one of the tweets that kind of gets.
Well, that's the thing.
I remember it and for a second there I was like,
that could be either of them.
I don't know.
Although it's like the dead giveaway
is the word troglodytes.
I can't imagine.
I thought troglodytes as a word has been used forever.
Like let's see.
Well, it's attributed to D and D though, isn't it?
Like some kind of port like tabletop sort of thing.
Oh yeah, that's a good word.
It's a nerd thing.
So I, yeah, because if troglodytes was said by Hitler,
I think like a lot of people would actually have like,
you know, they pull back when they'd hear the word more.
Yeah, well, I'll put that in for maybe
like just for a meme section sometime.
Yeah.
Is there a few entries in there?
Oh, there's a lot.
Oh, really?
There are times when I really hate that Jim Crow era laws
ruined the idea of intelligence testing for voting.
See, I assume this.
Yeah, because Jim Crow is after Nazis.
Well, I mean, the question is,
what are the, is it like Hitler quotes
or just random Nazi quotes?
Cause yeah.
Oh, look at this one.
There are no bad tactics, only bad targets.
That's moving Bob.
Yeah, you should say that.
What an awful quote to have attributed to yourself.
I'm like, there are literally things that Hitler,
like the Germans would do things to the communists
that they would not do to like the allies,
the Americans stuff there.
So I mean, in that sense, Hitler's actually more moral.
Like the Germans, the Germans and the Russians
in the World War II, they had exploding ammunition
were so like rifle rounds that would, when they hit,
they would explode.
Oh, also I don't think the our old movie Bob,
I just read the ones that I did recognize
that are so fucking controversial and yet are movie Bob.
But yeah, we'll try and check that out at some point.
That looks like fun.
I know, I just need, I know more controversial
movie Bob quotes than controversial Hitler quotes.
Mueller, at this point, you're gonna have to release
a good delve every day of the first week of April
to get all these quotes in.
I've got my work fucking set out for me, apparently.
I'm gonna have to get all my Rise of Skywalker stuff done
before April hits or March even.
Jesus.
I got some work ahead.
Anyways, have a great week, you celestial apex debater.
Don't worry, thank you, dude.
When Efap 9, when episode nine reveals the emperor,
it'll be Ian McDemon saying, it's me Skywalker,
it's me Skywalker, it's me all along Skywalker.
Lando says, oh, son of a bitch in the background.
Hashtag best writing.
My name is Sheev Skywalker.
Why didn't they just do that?
He was the Skywalker the whole time back.
Oh no.
Mueller, I first saw you with Captain Marvel Man.
I gotta say, Don is the hero.
I didn't know I needed.
Oh, yeah.
If only he had a spider to tell him his future.
He doesn't need that.
He can deal with anything, man.
He's the Don.
No bullshit's Jeb has the gay,
naglitious bagel spunk.
Oh my.
It's bagel spunk.
Oh, man.
Took me 30 minutes to write those descriptions.
Oh, the Efap.
I guess that's the guy who made the Efap IMDB.
So, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Check that shit out, folks.
It'll be cool to see it get all fleshed out in chunky-tisms.
Yeah, I guess a different group of fans found it first.
Like, because of the significant amount of downvotes
and downratings, it's like,
I wonder who, somebody must have shared it somewhere.
It was like, ah, Efap on IMDB.
Stop them.
Best supporting cast goes to Efap Chat.
Oh, yes.
Jay, how many seasons are funded for Efap?
How many seasons are planned?
I don't know that he's allowed to give out
that information entirely.
Like I said earlier, we've got the 100 episodes confirmed.
We were allowed to say that.
Anything else, it's all up in the air right now, you know?
We renewed for a third year.
I don't know.
We just gotta keep things rolling
and hope that stuff stays on the up and up.
That IMDB thing reminds me.
Check out Downward Thrust's page on Wikipedia.
There's an Efap section in regards to Tonald's lore.
Good.
That sounds good.
I hope there is.
Going to make an IMDB account to upvote Efap.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Yeah, we appreciate it.
And so does the guy behind it, I'm sure.
I've been working 43 of the last 48 hours
with no end in sight.
Save me, Efap.
Save me, Ra.
Use your roof powers.
Jesus.
Is that like...
Jesus.
That's 48 straight hours?
43.
43, yeah.
I hope that you've gotten some...
He's working 43 of 48 hours.
So it implies that he's still got a ways to go.
Hopefully he had some breaks in there.
Geez.
Within the last 48 hours, he's worked 43?
Yeah.
Well, no, he says he's been working 43 of the last 48.
Gotta make it to 48.
He's been...
He said no end is in sight.
He's been working 43 of the last 48 hours.
With no end in sight.
So of the last 48 hours, he's worked 43 of them.
So he had like breaks and maybe a nap.
Like a five hour break or five one hour break.
Where does he work?
Yeah.
I was gonna say, if he's still going right now,
at least you could listen to this.
If this is a show that he finds...
Yeah, I hope so, man.
I hope this helps.
Stay in, you know, keep, keep in, you know, there.
Turn that frown upside down, stick with it,
and enjoy the overtime pay.
Or at least I hope that they do it.
Jesus, if they worked for a company,
I also gotta wonder...
Unless you're on salary.
Yeah, I also got a one week.
Yeah, like 48, like 43 hours.
He's already on overtime.
He's guaranteed overtime.
Oh, hardcore.
But I gotta wonder, like, isn't it kind of illegal
to go over like 18 or 20?
I don't know.
It depends where, for like where I am.
As far as I know, you can pretty much work
as much as they want to pay you,
except once you get to a certain point,
you have to get paid overtime pay.
I remember...
As long as you're an adult.
I know there were certain states that they would kind of...
If you were a contract worker,
then they could like fuck you.
They could put it up to you, but...
Let me see.
Arkansas labor laws require employers
with four more employees to pay employees overtime
at a rate when 40 hours or more in a work week,
unless an employee is otherwise exempt.
There's probably work hours in Arkansas.
Minor, let's see.
Miners who are for it, that's...
Okay, yeah, if you're like a minor,
you can only work a certain amount of time.
Yeah, because it's dog in mind.
There are no state or federal guidelines
regarding how many hours
a Arkansas may work within a day or week.
So basically, if your employer is willing to pay you
and pays you proper overtime for your hours,
I think you can just...
If they let you, you can just keep going and going.
Work until you drop.
Jesus.
I mean, then again,
I don't think they can make you.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, I remember while I was living in Seattle,
like 20 was the cutoff,
and then like you'd have to be sent home.
Like there was no possible way they could do it.
There was a law against it.
So that's why I was thinking,
well, isn't it kind of illegal to be 43?
But I guess that's not the case in most states.
Anyway, I was just really curious about that.
Didn't mean to derail.
Hexagonal J3 are line less than symbol.
I don't know what that means.
Less jury.
Three less than?
No, like, well.
Did he misspell heart?
Maybe.
Oh, yeah.
Except I'm gonna go with it's a heart
and we give a heart back.
That is the nicest possible interpretation.
I'm willing to bet money that Palpatine will be just as,
maybe more useless than Snoke.
Hell, the slave kid at the end of TLJ
might kill him at this rate.
He's apparently gonna electrocute a whole bunch of stuff
with his lightning-tisms, so.
Yeah, I guess.
He's just gonna zap him right out of the sky.
His lightning knows friend from foe.
It's like I said,
he'd better use finger guns when he does it.
Pew pew.
You better say that too, pew pew.
Pew, pew, pew, pew.
More la say gun, egg, three times for a meme, please.
Gun, egg, gun, egg, gun, egg.
Wait a minute.
I know what he's trying to make you say.
I get it too.
Yeah.
Ray is, but is struggling with it.
Well, continuity breaks confirmed.
It's gonna be a lovely train wreck.
Yeah, the idea that Ray could struggle with anything
is ridiculous.
I'm upset on behalf of Ray fans.
She shouldn't struggle with anything.
She's old enough.
I'll dare imply she's weak.
No doubt, because she's a woman.
Saw Terminator 1 and 2 for the first time, amazing.
They are fucking great films.
Yeah, man, that's good stuff.
Now, if you watch the last trailer slowed down,
you can see the Sith dagger in Ray's left hand
when she and Kylo dual smash the statue thing together.
Why would you use a lights?
Why would you use a dagger saber?
What?
Well, it's implied because of the dagger.
When you have a lightsaber.
Yeah, but like, I think the leak said
that the dagger was a MacGuffin
and it's not an actual weapon to be used.
So she's like just holding it.
Like, you know, she can't just drop it anywhere.
Oh, okay.
I don't fucking know how it works.
Uh, are you gay if you experimented with the same sex
but ultimately have no real interest in them?
If not, is there a Tim?
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello, and no.
If you don't have a sexual attraction
to people with the same sex as you,
then you are not a homo.
You're not the big gay.
Yeah, if you tried it and you didn't like it,
that confirms you're not gay.
Mm-hmm.
Hi, Wag.
Hello.
Going to the U.S. for four in July and August,
mostly to California, Utah, Nevada, and Arizona.
Since you went to Grand Canyon recently,
you have any recommendations to definitely check out?
Grand Canyon.
I go there.
Very, very lovely.
Las Vegas isn't too far away.
If you can go to Vegas, spend a night or two there.
Man, go for it.
Enjoy yourself in Vegas.
I did a, we did some,
like we took like a trip down the Colorado River
in the canyons near.
Let me actually see.
Let me double check here.
This is the, the Horseshoe Bend at the Colorado River
is where we went.
I don't, I forget the name of the,
just if you look up Horseshoe Bend,
then it'll tell you what it is.
Page, Page, Arizona is where it was.
We went there.
I spent the day there,
but there's all sorts of stuff to do
around that part of the country.
A lot of sightseeing, a lot of hiking if you like that.
But I will say this,
did he say where he's coming from?
No.
What was the payment in?
Euros.
Euros, before you go to the west,
drink like a week,
start, fuck it, start now,
drink lots and lots of water.
You wanna get your body used to having lots of water
going through it because the climate might fuck you up
or no, it's the altitude, sorry.
When I go out there sometimes,
like a day after I'm there,
I get a really bad headache for like the night
and then it's done and I'm normal
and it's the altitude that can really fuck with you.
Some people just don't,
it's a little rough for them to get used to the altitude.
I'm one of those people.
So yeah, drink lots and lots of water.
You'll need it.
And when you're out there,
you need to be drinking a lot too.
Cause it's a desert.
Drink lots of water.
When you're talking altitude,
are you talking the flight?
No, no, not the flight
cause the flight is pressurized on the inside.
But the altitude of being that high up
in Nevada and places like that.
Right.
If you come, like I'm in Arkansas
and we're not very high up,
but over there in Nevada and the Grand Canyon stuff,
ooh, you're high up, air is thinner.
So water helps with the altitude and with the desert.
And the follow-up is also want to go to a shooting range
since we don't really do guns in Europe.
You know, a good place to go
or just the sort of place to go too
while not falling into some tourist trap?
I know there's a place that is around Vegas.
I forget the name of it.
I lament the fact that I wasn't able to go there myself,
but I saw that there was a gun range out there
that lets you rent like automatic weapons
and stuff like that.
There will be plenty of gun ranges in the US,
but that one in particular, if you go around Vegas,
might be worthy of booking a place there
so you can go all the way.
Big stuff, machine guns and all that, all that good stuff.
It ends. Plenty of shooting ranges.
There are plenty of shooting ranges.
It ends with lastly, HiWag.
Hello.
You did not read my super chat in eFap59
and I watched the super chat section twice.
So here you have five Euroniums to forget it again.
Also HiWags.
Hey, why don't they just say the thing I missed
in the super chat?
Sad face.
Also want to go to, oh yeah.
The Oracle is apparently a parasite.
In other words, they ripped off several journeys of Remus.
Well, apparently according to Jay's sources,
there's not even gonna be an Oracle now.
Oh no.
How horrible.
Oh yeah.
We shall see.
Long Man Bad, Watch Mandalorian and Rise of Skywalker.
Consume.
Oh, we've been consuming.
We will consume.
Oh yeah, the consumer, that response to the movie, Bob.
Oh yes.
That's because he says the words like that
because he's from Boston, right?
Like his accent seeps in.
So he would say like consumer.
If that were the case, it would be consumer
with an UH at the end there.
Jens, did you ever think Disney Star Wars would come to this
being so apathetic about the next movie
that you'd go through leaks on an Efap?
Oh yeah, see, this is the thing.
If I was very invested, I would be like,
no fucking way I'm touching leaks.
I've never gone through leaks like that ever before.
I despise leaks, but here, I don't give a fuck.
Mm-hmm.
Uh, at Rags, another channel got hacked, Major Kill.
Major Kill.
I don't know that one, but yeah, okay.
Let me take a look real here.
Maybe I remember it.
Do you think there is time to get the music guy
for Batwoman to write the soundtrack to Rise of Skywalker?
Trying to imagine like the Batwoman version
of the soundtrack for Star Wars.
That's interesting.
He's another Warhammer YouTuber.
Oh.
Looks like, yeah, an hour ago,
there was a stream of Binance.Bitcoin BTC giveaway broadcast.
He's a Bitcoin, looks like an Asian Bitcoin scammer.
Hmm.
And this is the channel?
This person got hacked?
Major Kill, yeah.
I guess they streamed, they streamed a CEO of Binance,
an exclusive interview with him, Cheng Peng Zhao,
which is a name that I trust a lot.
Yeah, I guess he, so that's,
they're both, so both him and Astartis.
Both Warhammer channels, interesting.
Terminator Resistance is a kind of low-fi budget shooter,
mostly okay.
The real draw is that the story was clearly done
by people who enjoyed T1 and T2
and the setting actually captures the future war feel.
Well, I mean, that's good.
From what I saw, the mechanics were very impressive,
but I mean, at least if the world is like fun
for someone who's a big fan of Terminator,
I feel like, you know, you have that.
That's not something that you often get as a Terminator fan.
So, I mean, have a look into it, folks,
if you think that would be something that you'd like.
Yeah, I can't deny, I'm curious.
Do you think foreshadowing is always required
in order for a twist to be effective within a story?
To what capacity do you believe it's too much
or too little, also high-rags?
Oh, hello, I don't think so.
It can't help, but at the same time,
as long as a twist makes sense.
Yes, the make sense part is really the important bit.
Yeah, it really needs to make sense,
whether or not it's foreshadowed or not, I don't think so.
It's usually just a neat thing if it is.
Yeah, a good twist is a twist where, when you get it,
you look back and you're like, oh, okay.
That was foreshadowing,
but I see how that could have made sense.
Yeah, and I feel like maybe-
Making room for it to make sense
is different than foreshadowing.
Yeah, and maybe the other term
can be like incorporation or reincorporation,
because foreshadowing can be like thematic
and all that shit,
but when you have like reincorporation,
you can notice a character did something in the background
that you missed earlier,
and then maybe it'll come into play later.
They'll be all like, when did that happen?
And then you can rewind with like,
oh, he fucking sneaky bad bastard there in the back, you know?
Foreshadowing's interesting.
The example I usually have as a go-to
is first episode of Game of Thrones,
Ned Stark, whose sigil is a wolf,
finds a dire wolf with the antler of a,
I guess, a stag in its neck, and it died from that.
And then the end of the season,
Ned Stark's head is taken off by a Baratheon
whose sigil is a stag.
So it's like, oh, I can see how they're going for that,
that kind of thing.
That was kind of neat foreshadowing,
but never anything.
I think I said this in the Game of Thrones video I made
where I was like foreshadowing
isn't like the reason a thing can happen.
It's usually just sort of like a neat thing, honestly.
I would put them in, because I think they're cool.
Like the way you can frame something,
you could have a character standing in a position
in your scene where in the background
there's like a knife that's hanging,
and if you aim the camera right,
it looks like it's hanging over them or something,
you could just do that,
and then you could be like having some kind
of thematic relevancy with a sort of Damocles, as they say.
But a twist, there's all different kinds of ways
to make twists effective, as Rags said.
The main thing, just make it make sense,
get that in order first,
and then look into how you can let the audience
have some awareness of it being a possibility,
but just be subtle about it, I guess.
Because foreshadowing is a different thing.
But I mean, there's probably plenty of videos
on YouTube that can go over that,
just to flesh out further what it means
to foreshadow stuff.
Yeah, just be responsible with it.
YouTube gave me three super chats to give you,
hope to hear Rags respond to Patricia Taxon soon.
Oh, probably not soon.
It won't be this year, there's no way we're gonna be okay.
Yeah, that video is fucking worthless.
Yeah, there are way more videos
that are worth mentioning than there are now.
Don't hold your breath.
It would be logistically impossible for this year,
and next year, the fucking first third of it
will be taken up by Rise of Skywalker stuff.
I think we're gonna forget about that video, honestly.
That seems to be what's gonna happen.
Thoughts about Green Eggs and Ham?
I enjoyed it.
I have no idea what that is,
I'm assuming it's a piece of media.
Yeah, isn't it just a new animated movie as of recently?
If so, I haven't seen it.
Traveling through hyperspace ain't like dusting crops, boy.
Without precise calculations,
we could fly right through a star
or bounce too close to a supernova.
Han seems less likely to impact directly.
Oh yeah, this is the thing, right?
So if you go by the rules of hyperspace,
it's like this mode of travel where you enter into a stream
and then you enter back out into reality, but you've traveled.
It doesn't make sense to do what Holdo did,
because that's not how that would work.
So, but Han would be correct in what he said
in that you could fly,
like if you end up in a star as a result of your thing
or fly through one during hyperspace,
I don't even know what that would do.
Maybe they don't even know what that would do.
I think it's something like you end up in fucking pieces
flying everywhere.
And so this whole, what did they call it?
Lights, sprinting, lights, springing?
Light springing, right?
I think that was it.
Doesn't sound like it's,
I think it's gonna piss off a hell of a lot of people.
Let's put it that way.
But I love the idea that they've invented it
to try and counter the hyperspace tracker.
That's very amusing to me.
Why not just have the TLJ tracker
be an experimental prototype
and with the fleet gone, so is the tracker.
I think that's a little contrived at this point,
the idea that they lose it because they lost the fleet.
You'd think there would be something to recover
and that several Star Destroyers weren't actually destroyed.
And this thing is apparently in production since Rogue One.
So, because they have like a little easter egg for it.
So I imagine that's not gonna work,
but I would say why not just not have it at all?
Let's just go that route.
In Halo 1, Cortana did have the coordinates
to the Halo ring based on the runes
of the Fall of Reach novel.
Not a blind jump.
Again, I don't know enough about Halo,
but I think that was a comment Rags mate, I think.
How do you determine the difference
between a lack of info in a story being a plot hole
or an open-ended element?
It can be open.
A plot hole is when it's actually contradicts something.
Yeah, like, so for example, Batman getting back to Gotham
when he had no resources, that's not a,
if we've described that as a plot hole,
what it should necessarily be described as
enormous convenience that he was able to do it.
It's contrived.
Extremely convenient.
I would say it requires an explanation to be complete.
But yeah, if he literally snapped his fingers
and teleported to it, we'd be like, what the fuck?
That's a major plot hole.
You can't just teleport.
That's bullshit.
But obviously we didn't see that happen.
We saw nothing.
Maybe he wasn't even there.
Maybe it was all a dream about that.
Yeah, on the flip side,
how do you figure if it's holding your hand
throughout the whole story?
I mean, you can be subtle about your information.
It's not exactly a known science to be able to figure out
exactly how much information is considered handholding,
but typically you're gonna wanna try and get as much out
as you can in as small amount of time as you can
in the simplest of understanding,
but also representing the complex elements correctly.
Very complicated, but that's where writing comes in.
Like, writing is a tough skill.
This is where the talent comes in.
In Halo 1, it's revealed that the Pillar of Autumn
actually didn't light spring.
Cortana used coordinates found on an artifact
to make the jump.
It's been so long.
I can believe it.
It really has, but that Theramaster Chief Collection
is on the way.
Cortana got the coordinates to the Halo ring
prior to the events of Halo CE.
She used them to escape Reach
because they could not go to Earth.
Was this information that we learned in the later Halo series
or was this in the books?
Where was, or I'm curious where that was.
Because there's the books and then there's the games
and then there's the later game,
which go more into Cortana.
So it was in the books.
So like the original books,
so we talked like Fall of Reach and First Strike
and Fall of Reach, First Strike and the Flood or?
Apparently it was in the books.
Some, Oni knew about the Halo ring already.
All right, I didn't know that.
It's been so long.
Yeah, I've played them so.
I didn't know that Oni knew about the ring, so.
I would rather listen to my parents get divorced again
than finish that stream.
I'm not 100% sure what that's referencing.
Maybe Efap, I don't know.
He said that stream though,
so he's referring, he's gotta be referring to another one.
Oh, the no bullshit one maybe.
Oh, that, yeah, yeah, yeah,
the one between him and he and Stitch.
That sounded really hard to listen to.
It's Sitch.
Is it Sitch?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, I was calling him Stitch this whole time.
Most people do.
I think I did when I first ever saw his name,
and I was like, oh, it's not Stitch, it's Sitch.
It's Sitch, and I'm just not paying attention, cool.
Recommend Norm Apollo's video
breaking down Joker's psychology.
It's amazing and detailed.
Also, got a Joker SpongeBob meme I'd love to share with you.
If we haven't shown it, try Twitter.
If that doesn't catch me, it should eventually.
There are some memes that get past me,
and then I eventually show on later streams.
Episode nine, The Cube.
Episode 10, The Aether.
Episode 11, The Orb.
Episode 12, The Scepter.
Episode 13, The Eye.
Episode 14, A Soul for a Soul.
I don't know if that's referencing something specific,
but unironically, that could be the future of Star Wars.
Just these things, these amazing objects, items, locations.
I guess it's always been that way, to a degree.
So what you're saying is that Palpatine is Bowser
from Super Mario Sunshine,
and they are ruining his vacation on his ice paradise.
Yes, hi, Jay, keep kicking, Jay.
No, kick, keep Jay?
You arguing you wanna kick him and keep him,
because that's, you know, you can't, it's impossible.
That's an impossibility.
That's abuse.
I was referencing the Infinity Stones.
Oh shit, I should have picked that up
from the Aether, I guess.
Well, that can be referenced as a lot of things.
The Orb.
What's the Orb in the Infinity Stones?
Oh, A Soul for a Soul.
That's what should have given it away for me.
I was just thinking about them as actual objects and stuff,
but the Sept, the Eye of Agamotto, that one makes sense.
The Orb.
Power Stone is the Orb?
Oh, I guess so, yeah, you could call that an Orb.
Yeah, all right, I follow.
Yeah, I'm just, I'll be honest,
I'm running on, I'm super hungry right now, also tired,
but we've still got two hours,
or well, one hour and 45 minutes remaining
to get through these.
We've still got a chunk left, so.
Keep on going.
We would read them if we could for you,
so you can grab a sandwich, but we can't.
But if Sidious really wore a cloak every time,
he wouldn't have gotten full-blown Sith Aids.
I'm pretty sure, as we talked about,
he got full-counter Sith Aids too,
so it didn't even really matter.
Nope, remember, you just gotta get blowed up,
and then you'll be fine.
I'm not looking forward to all the sequel trilogy
apologists defending Palpatine being Rey's grandfather,
saying, wow, now you guys don't want Rey
to be related to a powerful force user,
you guys just can't be satisfied.
Yeah, I guess not.
Yeah, they'll-
We don't know, this whole time we've never known
what we want, we definitely have,
we have no basis to say what's gonna be bad.
So my criticism, if someone was like,
what do you think about it being Palpatine's granddaughter,
I'd be like, ooh, we could make something great
with that, I think.
And then you're like, what about the one we got?
Like that story in these three,
I was just like, oh, they did terrible with it.
It's revealed like fucking halfway through the third movie,
and it doesn't really even make sense.
Apparently Palpatine's kids hid their kid for reasons.
I don't even think we discovered those yet specific
to those people.
Like we can imagine some stuff, but okay.
Yeah, I love, I just, I don't know,
the storyline could have been that she was really powerful.
That's fine with me.
And she slowly becomes a little bit obsessed
with this power, right?
She's power mongering, and she slowly turns super evil.
Like you could start the story if she's this generic hero,
but the fact that she doesn't even know
what she's fighting for or why,
but she just does the good thing.
And then slowly the good thing starts to turn
to different things as she figures out what she wants
rather than what's good.
And I think there could have been something there,
and then you reveal she finds out
some kind of bloodline thing.
I don't know, I probably wouldn't wanna make it
related to Palpatine,
because it's just a little bit too.
Oh, those leaks didn't even mention Rose Tico.
Yeah, I was kind of wondering, it's like,
it took a while for them to mention Finn,
but then like not a single glimpse of Rose.
About Rose, they didn't say her name once,
as far as I'm aware.
Yeah, no, I don't see a single Rose reference.
Maybe she's in it, but just not relevant
to the story that much.
She's just sitting in the background
playing with ball and a cup.
I'm a general, no.
God, when she pops up, assuming she does,
when she pops up, she's gonna be like, oh, God.
Oh, no, I thought we were done with this.
I made it to general, and hard to believe
that two, three years ago, I was nobody.
You could just be a general in three years.
Just that.
What do you mean three years?
Where are you getting that from?
One year.
Isn't that the time difference?
It's even worse.
I thought it was one.
Yeah.
Was it only one?
Yeah, that's what I mean.
It's even worse.
Why'd you do this all the time?
You make it sound better than it is.
Imagine getting to general in one year, Jesus Christ.
What kind of an organization is this?
An organization with 20 people.
I think that's what happens.
I guess if there's 20 people, yeah.
But well, apparently there's more, so fuck it.
I don't know.
One of those ones where you just,
you don't really ever understand what's happening,
and you're supposed to smile and nod.
This is probably the peak of consume and move on
kind of content.
Yeah.
That's Star Wars now.
Star Wars is just consume and move on now.
Yeah.
Everyone complains about why couldn't Luke
just teleport instead of dying,
but apparently Palpatine teleported away
from the Death Star instead of dying.
What?
Okay.
Well, let's see.
The thing is, it was really vague on how he survived.
Like, oh, he just plain survived.
I'm assuming the film is gonna have extremely vague language.
It's gonna be like, I survived.
And you'd be like, how I survived.
Okay.
The power of the dark side.
I sealed myself in a force capsule.
Like, okay.
Oh my God.
He's gonna teleport my ass to a different planet.
He's gonna do the Leia thing, isn't he?
They established the whole Leia thing,
and then he's gonna do the Leia thing,
and he's just gonna survive longer,
because he sits alone.
Like, all Sif can do that, right?
Didn't you know?
Right?
Can't you?
I'm bad now.
Star Wars, the Tism Menace, or the Phantom Tism?
Tismenace.
Really?
I kind of prefer the Phantom Tism.
Phantom Tism?
The Phantom Tism?
The Phantom Tism.
Palpatine survives full and explosion,
goes to Cloud City to get Luke's lightsaber,
runs into Maz Kanata.
They have an affair, creating Rey, brilliant.
And explains how Maz Kanata gets the lightsaber, too.
Nice.
There's a-
Maz Kanata, let me, Maz Kanata...
What are you looking for?
It's, I'm just, I'm just reacquainting myself
with her visage.
Yeah, she's apparently in this movie.
She wasn't mentioned either.
Oh.
Yeah, I would not.
No, nobody would.
I wouldn't, I wouldn't fuck her.
Some big orange.
I bet she has, like, mandibles around her vagina,
or some bullshit like that.
There's a book by Chuck Wendig, which says,
that Palpatine considered an empire
that failed to protect the Emperor, him,
a failure that has to die.
Okay.
Star Wars Episode IX and Mickey Mouse Operation?
Oh, chat, you never cease to amuse me.
Palpatine is a Ray-Lo shipper.
I could believe it.
Snoke will be an imagination of Kylo-like jokers, GF.
Fuck in front of me, so I can ascend to my true power.
Kylo's imagining Snoke the whole time.
He was never actually there.
That's the way JonTron said dad with Aaron one time.
Deed.
Deed.
I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here,
but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad,
dramaturgical?
Dramaturgical dyad.
A drama,
okay, never mess with a dramaturgical dyad,
aka what's wrong with his seasons,
with this year's season of Rick and Morty,
that's from 2017.
Okay.
Dramaturgical dyad.
Yeah, it's,
this is Itchy and Scratchy
comprise a dramaturgical dyad.
Huh.
Okay, I guess I gotta go here and,
man, if people want me to learn about this thing,
they're not making it easy.
They ain't making it easy.
Is it gonna be something like they complement each other
while also being each other's foils and exist together
and consist without each other or something like that?
More powerful together, I don't know.
Dramaturgical dyad.
Yeah, I guess I would look up dramaturgy
in sociology on the PDF page and then Control-F dyad,
which doesn't appear on the page.
Yeah.
Anyway, hey guys.
I wrote a story about Efab defeating Plank and Pei
for my college fiction writing class.
Would you be interested in seeing it?
Maybe doing a dramatic reading?
It has footnotes.
It has footnotes?
You like-
I don't, that's a risky maneuver, man,
for your college paper.
Yeah, just, you know what, just how did it go?
That's all I'm interested in.
Someone's saying that I gave Chewbacca a Dutch rudder.
I don't know what that is.
I can believe it.
A Dutch rudder.
Having someone complete the act of masturbation
by pulling up and down on the forearm
while the male holds his own penis.
Oh, okay.
Neat.
I used to think the squeal trilogy was a tragedy,
but reading these leaks, I realized it's a comedy.
I mean, that's honestly true.
Like, if you were to read,
if these three films were all lined up this way,
imagine this is how they were always planned to be
from the beginning.
What a fucking clusterfuck.
And like, it got leaked all three scripts.
Just be like, wow.
We would be stunned into silence.
Palpatine surviving is like if I survived the Titanic
by swimming to New York.
I mean, I think that's more realistic.
I think that's more, yeah,
I think that's like logically possible.
I would rather swim across a planet than teleport,
attempt to teleport from an explosion in space.
I know that one of those is at least theoretically
logically possible.
I would probably choose the last one.
The latter actually, because I think I'm gonna die in both,
and at least the second one will be quicker.
Freezing in like icy waters.
Icy waters, fuck off with that.
Motherfucker, you just sank in the Titanic.
That was the prerequisite.
Oh, is the Titanic the prerequisite?
No.
I'd still, I'd still,
I mean, some people survive the Titanic by the way.
I don't think they survive by swimming
from the Titanic to the shore.
No, but they could have gotten like onto a boat.
That is not the spirit of the question, and you know it.
The spirit of the question,
I still would rather go with the one that's logically possible.
Well, in fairness, it says swimming to New York
from the Titanic.
Swimming to New York from the Titanic,
location of Titanic crash.
I know this is probably split in hairs.
I'm gonna see how many bajillions of miles I have to.
I was gonna say, I don't think it's possible,
especially with the temperature.
Okay, so, oh my goodness.
Yeah, that's a.
Is it away?
Is it away?
It's quite a far away, isn't it?
Yeah, I'll just copy paste this here,
and you could see it's kind of like fucking far.
Oh, okay.
A few meters.
It's, yeah, it's only like two inches on my screen.
So, it's not far.
It would, yeah, okay, it would take you a few hours.
I think that's possible, yeah, you're right.
You'd need.
Let me see how many miles that is from New York.
Like, swimming is subjective.
You could be swimming in a boat,
in a pool in a boat while the boat took you to New York.
You know what I mean?
Okay, it's only 1,250 miles from New York.
You could do it, I'm sure of it.
When I was in Boy Scouts,
I did the mile swim, I swam a mile,
and I was pretty fucking tired after one mile.
So, if I can just imagine that,
multiplied by 1,250 times.
You got a couple breaks here and there,
maybe a quick lunch, and then I might be all right.
You stop this scenario, you do like a hundredth of it,
and then you go, I'd like to have a break now.
Hello?
Guys?
I could doggy paddle 1,250 miles.
Palpatine just wants to swap bodies with Ray
so he can understand what it's like to have tits.
Oh, that's a strange goal.
Does that seem out of character for Palpatine?
I don't think so.
Palpatine?
I don't know, he's got that creepy Sith cult.
He could probably tell him to flash him a few times a day
just to keep him on his toes.
Wouldn't even have to leave his body.
Yeah, man.
He'd just sit there and stare at tits, have a Force Wank.
Mola, would you rather watch the sequel trilogy five times
or watch Season 8 of Game of Thrones three times?
Or watch LaLouche Guillaz Ephimia 100 times?
Oh, honestly with those.
I don't know if I'd wanna watch the Ephimia thing 100 times
because that would take a while and be really boring.
And then the sequel trilogy versus the Game of Thrones one?
Oof.
Probably.
Well, what about, if they're both terrible,
is it gonna be like a matter of length?
Well, this is the thing.
I don't think I can, off the top of my head,
figure out which one's gonna be long
with these three movies five times
or a Season 8 of Game of Thrones three times.
Well, let's get, so the movies are like 90 minutes each
or how long was The Last Jedi?
Last Jedi was two and a half hours
and the new one is supposed to be two and a half as well.
I'm eating assholes sideways.
So two and a half hours, two and a half hours.
So we're already at five hours for those two.
I think Force Wankers was two hours, 10 minutes,
I wanna say, I can't remember.
But let's just say that's the truth.
That's like seven hours, at least.
I just realized that actually might be longer
than Season 8 of Game of Thrones
because that's six episodes.
Especially because you get to do it less.
Yeah, Season 8.
Yeah, all right, Season 8 of Game of Thrones.
Season 8, yeah, man.
If this is just a simple,
mathematic equation, man, oh, we'll do it.
Episode nine gonna generate 30 to 40 efaps
all by itself, unironically true.
We've still got TLJ efaps to do.
Oh, my God.
We'll get, it'll, we'll disrupt the monotony
of talking about the rise of Mickey now.
We need to do the efap before the rise of Skywalker efap
needs to be a TLJ efap.
Basically just going over some autism takes.
They are copywriting Dark Empire comics
but in a bad fanfic style.
I've heard that is the case, apparently.
A lot of it is just getting copied badly.
Wait, is Cats coming out on the same day as episode nine?
Is this true?
This sounds like the worst idea ever.
December 20th.
All right.
What could you say about, all right, yeah.
Good luck, Cats.
You can do it.
You can do it, Cats.
I would rather, there's a part of me, I don't know.
Actually, it looks creepy as fuck.
I would much rather watch.
I like, you were on your way to saying it
than you were like, fuck that.
Then I remembered that the trailer exists.
Yeah, you had to drudge through some repressed memories
and realize that you're making a mistake.
Seriously though, the trailer was kind of like
a repressed memory.
For a moment there, I actually forgot that I had seen it
that it terrified me.
My soul shivers at the mere memory.
And now you're gonna watch either one
out of sheer morbid curiosity.
Oh my goodness.
I'm cringing on behalf of something that I've watched
that I have nothing to do with it,
but it's like secondhand cringe.
What an interesting prospect.
You've got a movie that's probably too weird
for people and furries.
It's like, how do you do that?
And there's so many famous people in it.
Yeah, why don't you make them like hot
with big fucking tits and stuff.
At least it'd be like, yeah, it's furry bait.
At least there's that.
But this is like that weird middle ground
that no one likes.
It's like that predator meme.
It's like normies, furries, hating the cats movie.
At least Zootopia was like, yeah,
these are clearly just anthropomorphic animals
and everyone loves it.
Great, they're cute and funny and ha ha ha ha ha
and expressive.
And you don't have to be a furry to appreciate it,
but man, fuck, I mean, cats is just,
it's like, I'm not gonna say uncanny valley
because they're not trying to be human
and they're not, they're in that middle ground
of human and cat.
It's really weird.
Uncatty valley.
Ha ha ha.
Nailed it.
These spoilers sound like a cheap rip off of the EU.
Good Lord, I don't think I wanna be anywhere close
to the fucking, what that was that we read.
Don't wanna get anywhere near it.
He has a human fetish.
I've noticed a lot of people have a human fetish.
What was that about?
Very common.
Very weird.
Well, tickle my pickle, I caught an efap.
Hey guys, hello.
Hello.
Episode nine, Rise of Skywalker.
There's gonna be a few Skype calls
and they're apparently gonna be very important plot wise.
That's gonna be great.
I mean, apparently he can just call her
whenever he needs it.
Yep.
Yeah.
Wanna do it like three times during the leak?
I mean, yeah, pretty much.
Yeah.
1.2 billion planets explode in episode nine.
More here is compensation for your part two TFA video.
Looking forward to August, 2020 for part three,
dreading April, 2020 when A.G. Goodell melts my brain.
You can do it, man.
You can survive.
Dass, here's some money for that McMuffin.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'll have a nice depressed morning.
McMuffin money.
Yeah.
McMuffin.
McMuffin.
McMuffin.
Wait, how does Kylo grab the McMuffin
through a four Skype call?
I don't know, he just does.
He just up and grabbed it while it was around her neck
during the Skype call, huh?
Yeah, it's gonna happen.
The McMuffin was around her neck.
An episode in CW covers uncharted LS jumps.
The coordinates of comals.
The coordinates malfunction and sends them straight
into a star.
Also, the Republic is eventually able to find them
by looking at last known trajectory.
Well, their logic in this is that they jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
And that's how they lose the first order,
which apparently that's how that works.
The way they figure out where you're going with hyperspace
is reliant on knowing, you knowing where you were going.
We'll have to see the movie.
I don't know how they're gonna justify it.
Sexual harassment.
Anyway, guys, here's a McMuffin.
The necklace is actually a toy in galactic happy meal.
I can believe it.
It's a McDonald's happy meal.
Get a McMuffin with a MacGuffin and a hash brown.
Yeah, I mean, it sounds tasty.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'd like a McMuffin with rhino milk, please.
If that'll be the efap chain of fast food restaurants,
we will sell McMuffins and rhino milk.
Yep, just blue and green.
Just finished full in order.
Don't waste your time.
Oof.
Yeah, it's, yeah, we're getting some,
it's pretty split down the middle so far
whether or not people really like this thing.
Ray to Kylo, be my force daddy.
Oh no.
Hee hee hee.
Force daddy, watch me.
Shit.
Star Wars episode nine, the rise of various MacGuffins.
Looks like it, honestly.
Yeah, there were like three or four fetch quests.
Oh, this'll tell you where we are in the super chats.
Wait, Finn is Lando's kid?
No, actually, it's Janna, the other one.
So they make Lando a deadbeat now too?
Wow.
Lando's kid got stolen.
He just sort of didn't even try to look for them.
He just came up and stayed on a planet.
That's so bad.
You're just gonna keep fucking the Millennium Falcon.
Just concern himself with that.
Also, who's the mother?
Yeah, did she give a fuck?
I don't know.
Did he fuck like a coffee machine and a,
a kid popped out?
Oh no.
What's the way to tell him?
Oh no.
Rey is holding a dagger in the final trailer in the scene
where she and Kylo are destroying the statue thing.
Yep.
Yeah, that's, I'm starting to believe it more and more.
What's with the ST having older men just give up
and stay on their planets?
I don't know.
Hasstartist channel was hack.
Rags, please rally Efap to his Twitter account
and help him get YouTube's attention
and his channel restore.
CM Valrec, chapter master Valrec,
by the way, protected your accounts.
Oh, protect your accounts?
I guess that's what that means.
And like, yeah, just,
as we said, two factor authentication
is probably the best way to go for a lot of things, but.
I'll probably tell Arch, he needs to watch himself here.
Yeah.
Anything anyone can do to help.
I don't know what the process is or something like that.
So I'm assuming he's trying to get in contact with them.
I was just thinking of myself,
that creator chat that they give us.
It's probably gonna be so useless for someone like this.
Well, what is, has everything been hacked for him?
Or is it just like his Twitter account?
Or is it just getting the YouTube account hacked
can't be fun.
As far as I'm aware.
Well, the bad thing is that,
what if like the worst thing that they hack your channel
and they delete all your videos?
Apparently, because I've seen that happen before.
Apparently YouTube can recover them in that case.
Get, get, get, get, get, get.
Even though when you do it,
it says forever delete your video.
I don't think YouTube actually forever delete your video.
It's probably placed on some kind of temporary thing.
And once it's been there for a while, they'll be deleted.
But it's in case of the fact that someone hacks you
and deletes everything.
But yeah.
Episode nine also reveals that Mace and Lando
are also related to Jango and every other clone in Star Wars.
Of course, everyone's related.
So it's a two-way screw for Lando and Finn.
Ouch.
No, no, no, no, no.
It should be fine.
Coming to Disney Plus this winter,
it's Ouchy and Scratchy Show.
Oh, Ouchy and Scratchy.
Ouchy and Scratchy.
You said Ouchy.
I prefer Ouchy.
Just call it Sith Lord called Ouchy.
Ouchy, Ouchy.
I'm Ouchy.
Thank you for this epic podcast.
And hello, Rex.
Hello.
Ouchy man, take me back.
Oh, sorry.
Ouchy man, take me by the hand.
Leave me to the land.
I'm just gonna fucking Ouchy.
Ouchy is a meme now.
We'll have him.
I wish, I hope he's real if I can see him pronounce it
and it's like Sith Lord, Ouchy.
But read 09BW Comics.
Great.
Not SJW at all.
No one cares.
She's gay.
Actual characters with flaws.
Crisis promo is wrong.
She knows what MV is from Elseworlds.
09.
09.
All right.
Every time Ouchy is not on screen,
everyone should say, where's Ouchy?
True.
The dagger says, despite being 13% of the population,
dot, dot, dot.
And C3PO begins to sweat.
I actively hate Rey now.
How can the huge universe of Star Wars revolve
around a single character without which nothing can happen?
I wanna die.
Rey is what it was always about.
The first six movies that came out, that was about Rey.
Star Wars is finally becoming what Alec Guinness feared
it would be, sci-fi nonsense.
Well, yeah, actually reading those,
it is sci-fi nonsense, it's fucking nonsense.
It is nonsense.
Like I said, one of the big problems
with discerning whether or not these leaks are real
is that we can't rule anything out
as being too stupid for Star Wars now.
What a weird position.
It's what would Daenerys say?
They're using it stupid as a shield against me.
I'm fluent in over 6 million languages except this one.
Well, he's fluent in it,
he's just not allowed to speak it or whatever.
I can't have a fucking hell, man, that's gonna be so stupid.
He can read Ebonics, he just can't talk in them.
Because that would be racist.
That would be racist.
They're killing Threepio because the actor said
the sequel trilogy was shit.
I mean, he's not dead though,
they bring it back later, so yeah, I don't know.
Hey guys, he has 0.00002 billion dollars.
Ooh. How about that?
Ooh.
Hi, Jay, surprise moon.
Are you looking forward to another surprise moon?
I enjoyed watching you talk to Patricia, by the way.
Give this to Jay.
Will do.
We will consider it.
Ray sucks off the whim.
No, no, no, I don't think that's what I'm talking about.
Sucks off is what?
Well, his whim.
My reception.
It won't be proper Star Wars movie
unless they've built a spherical station
that can destroy 1.2 billion planets.
I mean, they've got a series of ships that can do it, so.
I can't believe Hux is gonna be revealed
to be the fucking mole and then he's killed a moment later.
And then they just blow him away.
That's gonna be, there's so much to say about this film,
these films, what they've done.
It's so fucking real.
So this is interesting.
Someone linked me this Quora thing.
There's a question on here called,
did Darth Sidious ever show any care for
or pride toward Vader?
Apparently we have a quote from Palpatine here.
Of all the monsters I have created,
I still regard Darth Vader
as something of a minor masterpiece.
No, he was not an entirely alchemical creation,
but he was my monster nevertheless.
Even though he failed to live up to his full potential,
there was much pleasure in transforming Anakin Skywalker
from a bright-eyed, Tussle-headed youth
into the greatest Jedi killer of all time.
Yes, he ultimately turned against his master
as monsters sometimes do, but that was my fault, not his.
Given the opportunity to create Vader,
I would end with zeal.
So apparently it's from Jedi vs. Sith,
the essential guide to the Force.
Well, that's bullshit now, go away.
So, I don't know.
He considers Vader like a fuckup
because he wasn't the dyad.
Rags, that didn't mention the dyad even once, what the fuck?
Well, this thing, this is from Palpatine,
apparently a quote, but it said,
he ultimately turned against his master
as monsters sometimes do, but that was my fault, not his.
Given the opportunity to create Vader again,
I would end with zeal.
So when is he saying this?
When is this quote taking place?
Is this supposed to be some kind of like weird,
his commentary on, I don't know, man,
that doesn't make sense unless that book was
baited by, he did survive, which.
Apparently this is the creation of monsters
was the third volume of Emperor Palpatine's
dark side compendium.
Sith balcony, big finger, the weakness of inferior.
Unfinished at the time of Palpatine's,
so this one was unfinished at the time
of Palpatine's first death at the battle of Endor.
So I guess even from the Wikipedia,
this is his first death.
This is not much of a death.
So yeah, I suppose, yeah, I guess this takes place.
Okay.
Dark side compendium.
This is from the Wikipedia.
I don't know.
Fuck it.
It's all stupid.
It's all shit.
Yeah.
It's all shit.
Anakin was supposed to be space Jesus.
Well, no, no, Ray is space Jesus.
Is 3PO Rose's sister.
To be fair, Anakin did more to end slavery.
These did, so.
Is 3PO Rose's sister reincarnated?
Oh, I'm being a port atheist.
Yes.
Now you need to debate, no bullshit.
Okay.
Is 3PO Rose's sister reincarnated only to be killed?
No.
Say what?
Why would 3PO be Rose's sister reincarnated?
Rose's sister reincarnated.
Oh man, imagine being that hot in life
and then you die and you get uploaded into C3PO.
That's a real crime.
Oh no, a terrible mistake has been made.
Oh no.
You thought you would find a hairdryer,
but it was I, Dio.
Get it.
Can I tell you how happy you have all made me?
I found efap about a month ago
and I never knew anyone hated Disney Star Wars movies
as much as I do.
I've been listening to the old efaps and love them.
Long man good.
Oh, thanks much.
Yeah, thanks.
Long man good.
There's a lot of people who hate.
The opening hour of the stream, you could check them out.
There's a lot of them.
Yeah, and frankly, you don't have to look
way too far for that.
I hope you guys will check out Glidus.
Oh yes, I know that channel.
Game of Thrones piss takes honestly hilarious
and you get a kick out of it.
Yeah, so G-L-I-D-U-S and his Game of Thrones videos.
They're good shit.
I believe I'm subscribed.
I feel like I haven't seen a video from him in a while.
I might not be, but yes, good stuff.
Check out.
Fun Batwoman fact, Alice's actress compared her character
to Walter White, citing they are both redeemable villains.
Oh my God.
Not even close, Alice, not even close.
I know.
I remember hearing a particularly bad take
that somebody was comparing Daenerys to Walter White.
I'm like, no, maybe if Walter White just suddenly decided
to murder his whole family and didn't feel bad about it,
but that's not what happened, so fuck off.
We'll use their innocence against-
It's a weapon, it can't be a weapon.
It's a weapon against me.
Good God.
Next Disney crossover, Oochy and the Dawn.
I'd watch it.
So see, now we don't know what Oochy looks like.
So now I have to wonder who's gonna bring Oochy into being.
Oochy, Oochy, Oochy, Oochy.
These leaks sound all fine and dandy, but I have one question.
Where are the droidekas?
That is one of the dudes in Phantom Menace says that.
And yeah, the droidekas, they're gone, unfortunately,
but not forgotten.
They are not forgotten, though.
Oh, what are you doing there, 3PO?
Taking one last look, sir, at my n-words.
Aww.
Imagine being a guy cast as a Knight of Ren in 2014.
You'd be like-
So shit.
Sweet, I'm in the new Star Wars movie.
I'm one of the Knights of Ren.
They filmed me for one scene in Force Awakens,
but they told me that it's gonna get fleshed out
like crazy a few years later.
All right, we're in a movie.
We're in a transport, it gets blowed up.
I guess I survived.
I'm dead.
Okay.
Well, that was something.
Good stuff, guys.
All right.
Well, it's a paycheck.
Act one, what's the point of the other acts?
Because sometimes you need more than one.
That's crazy.
Well, we were getting to the end of act one.
We thought the film would be wrapping up,
but we're like, oh no, this is only act one.
This film's gonna be dense, dude.
Dense as fuck.
Mola, check your Twitter.
You're reading an outdated version of the leaks
without the reshoots taking into account.
So stuff like the Dyad, the flashbacks are no longer there.
Oh my God, they're gonna get rid of the Dyad?
I can't believe it.
I'm not gonna see it.
If it's no Dyad, then they get no money.
That's betraying everything.
I love-
You gotta have the Dyad.
I love the Dyad.
God.
Well, this is the thing.
That's why, it's a win-win,
because ultimately we'll be surprised still
by what we see in the cinema, hopefully.
Ray uses the dark, dark, evil ways.
So she dews it.
I get it.
Dark, dark, evil ways.
Hard dews like Mountain Dew.
You can copy droid memory.
They did it in solo.
Well-
Of course you can.
You could transfer files from one hard drive to another.
I was gonna say, it's not a shocking premise, is it?
Well, the fact is that this movie seems to go like,
actually we did make a copy,
lololololol, C-3PO is fine.
It's just like, why did you tell us otherwise?
R2 was there, wasn't he, and he didn't say anything?
Yeah.
I don't know, man.
Also, we're saying this in fucking past tense,
like it happened.
Well, hasn't happened yet, but who knows?
By the way, can you hear me okay?
My Skype kind of, or my Skype,
my Discord crap is off.
We're making fun of Star Wars.
A gut shot is infinitely worse than a head shot.
Chewie wanted Kylo to die in pain.
Can you imagine?
That's what Chewie says.
I shot him so he would die in pain.
Mauler, please read the updates.
The same guy you're reading now
released the same stuff you're reading,
but he crosses out the parts that changed.
Integral parts of the story are read out or cut out
because Disney thinks audiences won't understand it.
Won't understand it?
It's not about understanding it.
Oh, yeah, it's so fucking complex.
I understand full well what they're going for.
It's embarrassing.
This message is just Palpatine's Wi-Fi password, lol.
I mean, could be.
It'll get you access to his files, too,
his password for his computer.
He's got all of his different fetches on there,
but he doesn't want to talk about them.
We should leave him alone.
We just gotta mainly just defeat him, is the goal, so.
Getting the Wi-Fi password is, what, like step three?
Getting there.
C-3PO, it's okay, I've committed the message to memory.
Other guy, I'll wipe his memory so he can read it.
What?
Won't he forget the message?
No, because he reads it,
and then he has to get his memory wiped or something.
I got no idea how that's gonna work.
I'll be very curious.
It would be better if after C-3PO says
he's looking at his friends,
they show Force ghosts of Leia, Luke, and Han.
It wouldn't make much sense, but it would be better.
I like the theory that in his head,
he's like replaying images of the friends he actually has,
and he's not actually looking at the people in the room.
That's the canon I choose to accept,
assuming this actually happens,
which seems like it probably will.
The Rule 34ers are gonna have fun with this movie.
I mean, any more so than usual, I guess.
They were tentacle creatures in The Force Awakens,
so I feel like that's the movie
they would have had the most fun with,
but what do I know?
Kylo, I see you eat a lot of corn.
Oh, because of the toilet, oh.
I'm trying to drink a milkshake, you rat bastards.
I think that was when we were making the toilet jokes.
Oh, yeah.
Don't stop.
Don't stop.
Star Destroyers were all crewed by orphans.
That explains it.
Happy Sunday, you gaggle of SJW KKK members.
Wow. Happy Sunday.
I mean, see Kyle.
Who's more likely to guess on EFAP first,
Bob Chipman or Jim Sterling?
I would say Bob.
Well, no, I'm sorry, I was thinking
at first, I was thinking like, who would we,
like, who would be more entertaining?
Who would I rather have, Bob?
I just want to pick his-
Yeah, I would rather have Bob,
but I think it would be much more likely to have Jim.
Yeah.
So there you go.
Star Wars is just a sequel to Lord of the Flies.
Very well.
A sequel to Lord of the Flies?
I mean, I don't see how, but.
I don't see how either.
You're going to have to follow that one up, my dude,
because I don't see it.
Star Wars is a sequel?
Or a prequel?
It's a sequel.
Sequel.
Star Wars is a sequel to Lord of the Flies.
No.
What?
Well, to be fair, it's only a sequel
if you interpret it as such.
Ray genocide's orphans?
Does Ray is based?
Ray genocide's orphans?
Oh, yeah, yes.
Yes, yeah, sure.
He does.
Begun, the orphan youngling wars have.
Oh, no.
They're kidnapping orphans.
Activate the dawn signal.
Look at this, shines his face in the sky.
Commence operation free candy.
The first order is an army, is an army autists.
It's supposed to be an army of autists.
Rumor has it that Kylo Ren real identity
will be revealed to be Onision
and that he's working under the orders of Jeffrey Snoke.
Ah.
Jeffrey Snoke.
Big twists coming, huh?
MGR's child soldier brains in adult cyborg bodies?
I remember that.
Ochi went back to his home planet and just died.
See, that's a joke, but like,
that's what's going to happen to Leia, apparently.
She just dies.
Yep, they're just having a fight.
It's like, remember me?
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
It seems your princess is in another transport.
Ah.
Godelb voice.
Send more superchats, it's free.
I'm noticing a lot of parent deadbeats in this.
Yes.
Lando sucks, Han sucks, Leia sucks.
Luke as a surrogate father slash teacher sucks.
I don't know, man.
That's a lot of tisms.
Remember when Buffy broke you-know-whose ribcage
performing CPR?
That's the new Star Wars is.
JJ brutalizing the corpse of a beloved franchise
in a desperate and futile attempt at saving it.
I don't think he's trying to save it.
There's no evidence in there
that he's trying to save Star Wars.
Check Sinimaro Verto's Twitter.
He's apparently in favor of firing everyone
even accused of sexual assault.
Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
I mean, if you kill everyone, no guilty people
would get off free.
Like, why doesn't that surprise me?
Like the-
Because he's a psychopath who doesn't value human-
Immediately, I'm like, yeah, that's probably his take.
Oh well, oh yeah, well guess what, Bob?
10 years ago, you sexually assaulted me in a bathroom.
So get up against the wall.
Oh God.
Then he'll accuse the officer arresting him
of assaulting him, but then that officer loses his job
and it's just an infinite stretch.
But yeah, weird rags.
Like, in just a moment, you've shown
that it could possibly be manipulated.
Manipulated.
Oh man, I had to flex my fucking galaxy brain muscles there.
Took a long time, but you managed to prove the point.
Nice.
Clean your room, do it.
All right.
I think he's referring to Palpatine and all the kids.
Do it.
Please cover OSP's trope talk on eFap.
OSP's trope talk?
Overly sarcastic productions, I think that is.
But which one?
There's like a load of them.
I don't know if any of them are particularly tismy
or agreeable.
Maybe both.
Palpatine had plenty of concubines in Legends EU.
Is that even a possible question?
We knew that was happening.
He was creaming and sheaving all over the place, man.
Every day, every day, a whole crew would come in
with mops and buckets to the.
Need my spud.
They would just dunk it all over the side into the shaft.
Why won't Discord let me curse in super chats?
I mean, I figured they would let you.
Well, I guess it's tears.
You could probably say naughty words,
but not too naughty words.
Or naughty, you get what I mean.
Have y'all watched Arrow?
Seasons one, two, and five are fantastic.
Better than Batwoman, for sure.
Being better than Batwoman is not hard.
No bar.
And I've heard Arrow is the best one out of all of them
at its best.
That's at least what people seem to be saying.
But holy shit, I do not have a good impression of the CW,
just as a production sort of channel-y thing.
Like I wouldn't trust anything coming out of them, basically.
Um, this is from Creamy Sheev himself.
It's true.
My name comes from the way I make women cream their pants
at the sight of my wrinkly, creamy, lightning, shooty dangus.
They're quite shocked.
The way that rolled off your tongue was fantastic.
It felt right.
Someone linked this.
The CEO of FedEx has just challenged
the New York Times business section editor
to a public debate.
Over what?
Apparently, the New York Times published
a distorted and factually incorrect story
on the front page of the Sunday, November 17th edition
concerning FedEx and our billions of dollars
of tax payments and billions of dollars of investment
in the US economy.
Da, da, da, da, da, blah, blah, blah.
I hereby challenge A.G. Salzberger,
publisher of the New York Times and the business section
editor to a public debate in Washington, D.C.
with me and the FedEx corporate vice president of tax.
The focus of the debate should be federal tax policy
and the relative societal benefits of business investments
and the enormous intended benefits to the US economy,
especially lower and middle class wage earners.
I look forward to promptly hearing from Mr. Salzberger
and rescheduling this open event to bring further public
awareness of the facts related to these important issues.
Oh, I can't believe there's a FedEx New York Times face off.
This is amazing.
Do it, I guess.
I want companies to openly hate each other.
Do it, do it.
Star Wars, MacGuffins and Convenience edition.
Are you describing TFA or Rise of Skywalker?
Or the newest Fallout game.
C3PO is now the one fish that loses his TV show
because of crabs realizing he's not dead.
I didn't watch enough SpongeBob to get the reference.
Oh, what?
It's referencing a scrunch SpongeBob episode.
Scrunch.
I think it's Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
You try pinching that and then just like,
what the fuck is wrong with his shit?
What?
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-a-bob.
Scro-d-bob.
Where's the baby?!
This is from CreamySheev again.
No, no.
You will cream she've giddy spell Manning Spunk.
It's like a Harry Potter spell in the immortal words of Mike Stoklasa endless trash endless
trash this is gonna be great trash forever folks the wayfinder if they don't play the
is this the way to amarillo song during the film they won't they're not that cool this
is what I mean by like if go full memes I totally do that I'd involve that wake me up mp3 yeah
this is this is where the super chat is starting to accept how terrible this
script is relaxing watching football and e-fapping yes all right yeah good stuff hey molar have you
read the revenge of the sith book by Matthew Stover or listen to the audiobook if you haven't
definitely try the audiobook the voice acting from Jonathan Davis is fantastic
um Jonathan Davis is it was the guy in Game of Thrones right he was the high sparrow or
or is that Jonathan something else high sparrow Jonathan something Jonathan let's have a look
Jonathan Davis American singer this is not who I was thinking of
well I mean yeah I I'm sure it is neat um maybe I'll check it out one day perhaps
um no Jonathan oh Jonathan Price is is the guy I was thinking of and Gimli is John Rhys Davis
so Jonathan Hyde yeah there's a lot of Jonathans out there hello all my fellow Jebusits Jebusits
Jebusites I would have I would have accepted that Jebutans but you know Jebutites
Jebutites hello everyone hi rags hi maulers hello wolf my love will do and hello
kylo has become less threatening than team rocket who kylos become less threatening than team rocket
he's just kylo red is blasting off again literally falls in a fucking chasm and then a little light goes
and he shouts that on his way down
oh Jebusits Jebus that makes sense actually uh Ray is Gretchen Thunberg's older sister change my mind
it I I'm not going to want to change your mind sounds about right Han shows up to talk to kylo
Luke doesn't Anakin doesn't Ray is saved by Luke Kylo isn't Hollywood needs to be
genocided and women barred from working oh my goodness by that ending you might be able to
guess who that was toxic broods yes it was Jeb toxic broods reading of episode nine is light
years more entertaining than the movie will ever be also hi rags hello I like to believe that yeah
I mean if we had the script as released we probably would have way more fun reading that
out than actually going to see the movie yeah we've got competitive shitting uh retard storm
troopers I mean come on dude best part of new star wars dommel gleason the actor who plays hux
um I he's been he's been neat I mean I think he's a great actor on his on his own it's just
that hux is kind of one note shouty shouty shouty you know so here's the thing when we we did our
we did our big oh we didn't did we ask um uh god pk was that his name in here I forget his name
his name was Ryan and yes I asked him the question okay good good good you went with Finn he went
with Finn I just want to point out that I think it's only me and one other person who said robot
head robot head in myself so I'm I'm telling you man we no you definitely is strong contender it's
gonna be tough to beat it people don't people don't think about hux I was like hmm I mean it was
a good choice because because what you could have ended up with was them just making him general
general man and then he just gets killed in an explosion and that's it like that could have
happened but instead they've gone with this nonsense it's like okay um beginning to think
ryan johnson actually wrote this well jgs didn't exactly do a great job with tfa so
uh youtube is letting me do this praise our overlords yes praise praise google thoughts
on writing apocalypse fantasy stories tips on writing apocalypse fantasy stories no just thoughts
thoughts so apocalypse fantasy so like an apocalypse in a world that's actually made up
so I'm sorry is his question thoughts on an apocalypse fantasy story
well so the question is thoughts on writing apocalypse fantasy stories
when they say thought I mean go for it I mean towards some shields and shit
um you kind of have that in uh I guess dark souls is kind of that dark souls is sort of like that
um but yeah just add a um but basically just go with like a post-apocalyptic kind of world
and you could if you want to start off with a blueprint in your head for you know to keep
things together you can start out with like a fallout or something like that and then remove
the things you don't like and maybe ground it in other ways and then maybe add like small elements
make it like a use like a low magic fantasy setting uh a witcher witcher would be a fairly
good kind of idea for that where mages and stuff they're not very common but they're like a big
deal you know they're very powerful and important you know that sort of thing um and then kind of
insert those into a post-apocalyptic thing and maybe you can say that due to an explosion um
at a facility that happened to cause the world to go bad bad radiation mixed with a certain
machine blah blah blah to create a genetic mutation that blah blah blah and certain blah
blah telekinesis so you can do something like that you know uh don't try to explain it but just
lightly refer to it every once in a while you know or maybe the magic has really started to go out
of the world and a lot of people put too much reliance on it and then now people are starving
to death and dying in droves or something like that because they put too much faith in magic
put too much reliance on magic and now the magic is kind of fading out of the world people are
dying by the truckload maybe um i know borderlands has the siren thing going on uh where they're
it's rare very very rare about being you know they have powerful abilities something like that
but yeah i focus on you know you go post-apocalypse i like kind of realistic stuff
um a lot of character uh a lot of moral choices and a lot of do we do go where do we go
what do we do how do we divvy up resources you know what does our faction need us to do
do we have to go to really really stress the whole abandoned complex idea fuck it put it set
it in the ussr uh kind of area i don't have to actually be in the ussr but you know those kind
of thematics and you know stuff like that i mean this is the thing for me apocalypse fantasy is
like holy shit that's broad there could be a whole bazillion different things you could be going on
all sorts of stuff all sorts of stuff there's also just general writing advice versus uh specific
but um because what comes with writing believable apocalypse styles societies versus what is
believable fantasy style societies and then combine that and you're like oh jeez but um i
would be intrigued nonetheless in a story that was premise was a fantasy world in which an
apocalypse had taken place and this is a result it'd be like oh my goodness so much to absorb
yeah it's like we said dark souls is a perfect example that world is fucked
yeah just a little bit a little bit yeah jj should go back to doing what he does
best lens flares i guarantee you will get a shit ton of them in this movie
to balance the force a lot of children have to be killed for example a jedi temple worth
of younglings or an army of mentally six year olds hi rex hey yeah the x-wing is broken she
force flies it obviously yeah she uses the force to keep it together and she uses the force to fly
it to where she needs to go oh my god makes total sense check offs x-wing in the final scene ray and
kylo are beaten by palpatine then mikey spark appears in her iron man suit to create the stars
then lady triu appears and shows them all they've been trapped on end or end
i don't know what the fuck just happened when i read that
fighting and brave i am not drunk enough for this i don't know if i could ever be drunk enough
for this yeah i know that feeling yeah don't try it was getting exhausting after a while i'm
gonna tell you it was like and then and then yeah you're like oh my god stop where's my force ghost
qui-gon bin this whole time no he doesn't care he's out he's he's chilling he's on like a beach
somewhere yeah at this point star killer should just be made canon to kill maraisu an emo descendant
after being trained by palpatine star killer would be refreshing he would just kill them all
and then yeah he still couldn't beat ray oh no he'd never be able to beat ray
she's godlike what if jj leaked the script so that he could have people proofread it for him
there was the we barely fucking proofread that we just laughed at it all
he's not gonna find it very useful for he's been he's been listening this whole time he's like all
right everybody start over um six million star destroyers that's an interesting number i mean
i don't think he's gonna have six million star destroyers that's a lot of star destroyers i don't
know if they can i don't i just don't think they can handle that you know
if vader couldn't betray luke because their family then what was kylo's excuse
when he killed han yeah uh
i hope that's not a line in the movie it's like of course i should have expected this
they're fably it's like what the fuck look what you're doing to ray she's your family
yeah great have any of you seen youtube original show impulse team drama based on the movie jumper
should be garbage but it's actually exceptional from episode one never heard of it jumper wasn't
teleporting one right well it this is spelt jumper without an e like jumper oh fuck off
well i don't know if that's the same thing or not is all i'm saying i don't even know
it could be something else yeah tender
well if something else is called jumper and you want to be called
you can cut out the e and then you can be a cool new jumper okay you don't save any syllables
yeah but that's the point right you can get spelled differently people
people probably will take longer to spell it because they have to remind themselves to
actively not press e you know if they do they have to go back and change it
uh they're in the r next to each other but you you just want to hmm they're just pulling
force abilities out there us now they were doing that the whole time it's nothing new
nothing what's growler oh the gay bear social network hey oh i might want to sign up for this
shit find my and find myself a hot bear daddy if palpatine survived return of the jedi what
the fuck was snoke i don't know there's gonna be a throwaway line for snoke apparently i will be
gluing them ears to the speakers at that point in the film i swear to god uh they turned into
a shy from samurai jack finale they turned him into a sigh and i have an arkansas so they'd be
a bunch of like fucking redneck types i have not seen samurai jack unfortunately uh they kill
kyle by throwing and they kill kylo by throwing him down a hole yeah how do you feel about that
rah kylo is defeated by a hole it wasn't from a roof yeah thrown off a roof into a hole that's
the ultimate death rah it's just just a little shack built next to the hole just waiting for
the day he could toss somebody off of it can i sue disney for filling my head with such nonsense
if i end up getting brain cancer i think i can because by the look of it anything's possible
yeah you can you could sue people for all kinds of things you could probably try and find a way
um finale of efap season five i don't i think we're on season four so uh i don't know where
the finale of season four would be actually i feel like this is the mid-season the jenny thing
like we the jenny the jenny stream was the end of season four part one and this is the
beginning of season four part two uh seems to make sense to me um ghost help is literally
from harry potter well i mean ghost help ghost help like that's a thing that is typically
harry potter did probably did not come up with the idea of the spirits of the dead helping
mortals that's like your opinion rags it is my opinion the leah luke thing has been cut instead
she hears every jedi ever giving her a pep talk and then ray gets a power boost
that's still terrible every jedi ever mace windu
this is the sub jedi is supposed to give like an inspiring quote they didn't know
like they were just chilling out their own way they just let you just so you hear like
you can do it ray like believe in yourself and then wait what the fuck's going on
like that's just one of the lines yeah wait what's happening what's happening
okay is snoke explained in any way or how do they know cidius is the last and one of the
forces rebalance and more dark side like yeah yes all of this yes yes yes it's all dumb also
also when they die that's just not even the end of the battle now that's just gonna be force ghosts
fighting force ghosts and then when they die who fucking knows at this point it would make
more sense for sans from smash brothers to appear as a force ghost at the end and tell a pun so
unbearable that everyone's head explodes like in the movie scanners that's the guy who celebrates
sans being in smash brothers every stream and this time he used it to try and suggest a better ending
to the film i appreciate that and you know what i think it even works oh great yet another evil
empire if what else can you do in star wars i like the because rich evans has been saying
that for a while it's like they followed his plan of you know like they had to do all this stuff
it's like but everyone hates it well i say that like i just don't agree there's all there's a
bajillion things you could do in this galaxy in this universe i i wonder if we asked him that today
if he would still stand by it because his point was he actually thought about it his point was
less to do with whether or not you can do it it was more that whether or not people will go out
and see it right because you remember they develop it into like who's they gonna blow up and then he's
and then he's like nobody would blow up in this theoretical like story about a different thing
and then he's like well then it's not it's not gonna work and i just like to think that like you
could have had a mandalorian movie that could have been disney's first one and it's just solely about
this brand new character i feel like that would have done well i that's what i said i that's the
one that would be the hardest thing to fuck up because it would just be you don't have to have
characters or good writing it could just be a bounty hunter doing bounty hunter stuff and just
being a badass of it and then you have another movie a big job about this person doing a thing
and what i'm trying to advocate for here is you easily could have had your stupid money grubbing
mcu of star wars you could have had all these different characters doing all these different
things and then big budget crazy movie where they all cross paths and some epic thing
you could just i mean that could have yeah i mean even if it was nothing but them once every once
in a while there'd be a confrontation between them or they'd meet up or they'd have to cooperate or
maybe fight you know i mean man that would be that would be nifty the universe is perfect for it
but they just don't have the talent to do it i guess i don't know and who knows what we're
gonna get coming forward now because they keep stumbling all over the place we shall see episode
seven they shot themselves in the foot episode eight they cut off their legs episode nine they
swallow a grenade and triple flip into a pool of lava i agree with that uh this is on par with
saberite jacks for darley no ball oh wow i guess if that's the second reference it must be quite
close hmm uh don willing episode nine is the end for kathleen kennedy who knows who knows
hi mauler i'm sad i'm getting to the point in my life where i need to choose a career path
i want to be an artist but that seems slim i could really use some words of comfort
words of comfort i think an artist hmm well interestingly there's a lot of artists but at the
same time there's a lot of artists who stand out who make their own you know make their own way
who have their own unique styles yeah and oftentimes when you feel a little lost on in terms of like
what a career the career is going to end up being and sort of like it's i mean in my situation it
was um it just it was just pursuing the thing you love doing that it turned out to actually be able
to be monetized in one way shape or form um i don't know if that's applicable to what you're
after but it could be maybe focus on a more traditional job and then transition slowly
but surely into art as your job get a little thing here get something there you know put more effort
to it in here do more work in it there do more hours to it there slowly but surely you know turn
go from one you know one thing is a money source to the other thing is a money so yeah like you
can if you end up with a job you do don't like and know you won't pursue but it is bringing you
in money just use your use your time that remains to focus on that thing you want to do and want to
be um a lot of people end up doing that for the most part i'd say like that's what turning a
hobby into something that can make money is definitely something everyone likes to try and
find a way to do uh to a degree or they spread out on the kinds of art maybe don't just stick with
art maybe learn some animation um that sort of thing you know so that you could increase the
amount of skills so that you can use your art in tandem with video creation with animation with
graphic design and stuff along those lines to put it all together and kind of create your own sort
of thing you know get more skills you know broaden what you can actually do build up your portfolio
say i could do this this this and this um surprise ending vader also survived collects
the lightsaber pieces ray left on tatooine and swears vengeance on the woman who usurped his son
oh if you want to make oh i'll just be frank i don't i can't believe i didn't think about this
for uh earlier if you want to make it as an artist be a just draw furry porn
i mean i'm just i'm just i'm gonna be flat out fucking honest with you man just draw furry porn
for people some people make a shit ton of money drawing furry porn well he's not wrong it's a
crazy industry out there just tell your parents that you do commission work for
draw for other private interests yeah custom pieces yeah
but yeah uh assholes for living the idea of vader surviving by the way it's like
give them time give them time vader will come back probably he's gonna be trying to bring vader
back as much as fucking can um only my second live efap thanks for the good times boys hey no
problemo yeah so she does commit identity theft technically yeah uh sort of i mean it's certainly
going to cause confusion also that's where we're in the super chats we're at the end of the leaks
in the super chats now oh wow yeah holy diver you've been down too long at the desert fair
sans rough course and it gets everywhere look out no no was wait was that did that rhyme um
um fair everywhere yeah yeah yeah that's clever uh just hearing the leaks makes me physically ill
yeah it makes me physically lots of emotion um resigned and just grudging acceptance of this
terrible fate that's befallen this franchise this could be the one that breaks the dentists
like even they've had too much of this now it's like it's like watching your best friend drive
away for the last time my jab fell over trying to understand all the tism it's like being at your
uncle's funeral where you didn't know him really like that well you weren't that close but you're
still sad and you can see all of the other sad people around you and really that's more impactful
than the actual you know funeral part is that's kind of what reading star wars leaks is like
and then the casket bursts into flames
and the body spills out the casket falls on top of it oh no it just explodes
so wait is everybody like gandalf yes everyone can return and will return and nobody can die
okay it's just how it works and everyone knows it'll be his force how i love the fact that he
says leah hasn't figured out how to be a force ghost yet but han solo did like so fucking dumb han
solos completed his jedi training freshly squeezed he was secretly training freshly
squeezed rhino milk for everyone even jay you know how some people have guitar lessons well
han solo took force lessons and every week specifically he took four ghost lessons like
he knew he was gonna die he's like he's like i don't want to learn how to like pick up stools
and shit no no i just want to when i die i want to be a force ghost well if you found out that
that was a thing you might be like i mean sure sounds kind of interesting at will i can manifest
myself and control the world and i never age and i have all power almost like superpowers like
thank you all the stuff that you could do for the world absolutely yeah and you wouldn't get like
tired i guess because you don't have a body yeah imagine a force ghost being like i'm a bit tired
it's like what you can just go anywhere too you don't need a ride just teleport
wait why did so no but oh man said you take the lesson after you die mola
when you die you go to force ghost purgatory and then all of the force ghosts there teach you how
to proper force operate i mean that's yeah because i was gonna say that's even worse
it just makes even less sense um also high rags hey that's from bilbigidius bagificus
when did palpatine become as dumb as eggman from sonic adventure 2 and his plan was to blow up
earth in order to create his empire stadium i don't know about the thoughts that go through this
person's mind maybe maybe he's grown senile and old when his brain got reassembled all the atoms
didn't quite fit together so he's a little retarded now that's why he's just indiscriminately
shooting force lightning at the sky none of the sith followers have the heart to say oh it's getting
old he's getting old and i guess i know darth asmodeus or whatever your name is i know just like
hey mola how about the youtuber rebel taxi i have never heard of them no no idea me neither
who has watched red versus blue i have watched red versus blue many years ago yes me too i watched
a lot of the seasons a long time ago i don't remember a lot of it now
uh this is what life is now sad face pretty much uh with dark fate game of thrones and the predator
these were all things where i was like this isn't true yet it still might not be but it was
so i think this is just another one of them this is going to be true guys we're in the nice stage
where it isn't true yet it will be though um das could you make a nutshell vid of dis movie
and gmod also where did oh wait i guess there's multiple questions so nutshell vid of dis movie
and gmod yeah it'll be easy yeah yeah this one yeah no yeah no problem uh 20 minutes uh it'll
only take me about uh another 20 minutes good to go also where did rose go is she dead
yeah oh no no no no rose is a fucking general oh yeah i guess she really died from a coma in
the last film no she'll be around what if it's a year i can't i can't believe she went from
nobody to general in a year wasn't she like engineering commander or some shit like that
it's i don't know man like we don't have to wait until they tell us exactly what it is
we're gonna get there it's gonna happen um hey guys got my date for usaf january 28th so
a few more months of efap thank you all so much for being amazing and inspirational also high rags
hello yeah so good stuff man um please tell me chewy's not dead vinny did end better
no chewy's fine they're gonna bait his death though that's gonna be funny this is the end game
of female social empowerment education and suffrage everything you know and love repaid and
sacrificed on the altar of equity by corporations that enslave people around the world to make them
purchase their products in tar and feather all dissidents who challenge their authority
remember that these corporations run literal slave farms around the world to manufacture
your clothes shoes electronics even your chocolate with no compunction
soy's who worship and defend them should be shot are you going with shooting this time
no rooftop all right and then just a super child says i love it um i'm baffled thanks for the
stream this sadly makes tlj a better ending to star wars than what episode nine has to offer
yes tlj alone would be a better ending if what happens in those leaks happens
um episode nine will be more gay than debates oh my god pretty gay dude i need a hug oh this
is after all the leaks everyone's really sad so force goes fighting directly equals if the
armies of the dead took out sauron after saving gondor i mean yeah to a degree that would have
been awkward in lord the rings wouldn't it if they just said i will release you if you go and kill
sauron and the ghost just pour over his tower like fucking ants and he's like stop it if these
leaks are real and they most definitely are then riser skywalker will make the amazing spider-man 2
look coherent by comparison i will say the plot of this film looks utterly insane if the if the
leaks are to be relieved just with how busy it seems to be yeah like people are moving they are
grooving they are jetting here and they're they are getting shit done also we have 40 minutes
remaining and uh i don't know if we're gonna be able to make it we will try doom all right this
is probably for the best it'll be ugly but hopefully this will kill star wars and lay it to rest
no i doubt it no it'll keep going no it won um you're gonna see knives out by ryan johnson
i'm not gonna go see it no um i will wait until it comes out while this movie sounds like absolute
garbage and i will despise it and its many inevitable defenders really enjoying this season
of efap efap season four we're gonna need a taller roof yes the amount of things we've thrown
off the roof are starting to act as a bungee for the thing well like a trampoline sort of for the
people we're throwing next to just land on it like hey i'm just looking for it's not killing him
anymore there's just two bodies just too many bodies down there uh razor fist is the bodies
soften the new bodies yeah that's what i was going for um razor fist is missing out by not
seeing joker yeah everyone should see it everybody why are you not seeing joker
i don't know if he's got some kind of position against it or something
there's a reason that it's becoming a billion dollar r-rated movie
uh almost every male hero has been shirtless at some point in the mcu but god forbid women can
be sexy too no that's objectifying them with men it's just fine female gaze
uh this film is going to be worse than star wyrms 2 attack of the pleasure pods look that up it's
a real thing there isn't star wyrms one there's no star wyrms one but there's a star wyrms two
okay okay um i'm sorry for giving money to to disney for tfa rogue one and tlj i'll never
do it again i promise but bane dades don't fix aids and aids kills you like disney killed star wars
uh i laugh because i must not cry that is all that is all i will never buy anything
connected to disney ever again get fucked surveillance capitalism star wyrms 2 is a real
thing yeah um what do you mean by worse i don't know what that's referring to exactly i'm afraid
um also from weekend warrior i hate copper lads that's the um the thing about the kids
restriction thing right hmm i wouldn't have thought he would get in weekend warriors way
too much i didn't i wouldn't have thought he would consider his stuff kids content but
but yeah if it's uh it's getting the way of shit sure
what do you think about the writing in red dead redemption 2
um i'm gonna be honest with you i have not played that one yet i have not played like i was i'm just
kind of waiting like i'm not that's the kind of person that really is interested in like the wild
west sort of things neither in movies or games that's just kind of a personal preference for me
and if i'm gonna try it i'm gonna wait for pc i i just i want to play it but i'm gonna run to
yeah apparently it's busted right now so we've got to wait for it to fix great fish from sponge to
tod you sir are the greatest artist who ever lived meme this please okay uh sorry what do you think
about it i don't know what that's referring to specifically so i was right most inconsistent
character in nine is the force itself there's an argument to be made for that for sure um i
guarantee that disney intended this trilogy for small children slash preschoolers who don't think
too hard or ask too many questions probably 60 of the reasoning for some of the stupidest decisions
but that wouldn't make sense because they bring it back characters that people who are six years
old couldn't be invested in you know it's like what are you doing here um ray kills palpatine
how is there any doubt did you ever imagine hearing that statement
no so like picture watching the force awakens all the way back then and having someone tell you
ray will kill palpatine yeah you're all like okay so it's funny because i would immediately
be like oh clone or like some kind of you know some kind of thing like it's not gonna be the
the thing like no it's the thing i'd be like oh
is it solely kill them again is it solely about money and politics is it really the
only reason they are purposefully destroying iconic licenses i need an answer please uh
the answer is yes i mean i'd happily throw incompetence shareholders oh yeah if they
i think it's incompetence too like i don't think they're purposefully doing it they just think
that this is how you're supposed to do it this is the only way they can think of doing it
yeah this is from jj chica jj abrams is an embarrassment to jj's everywhere
it's true i'm absolutely going please i'm absolutely going 80 20 rise of skywalker
because it's fresh jj is a master of polishing turds ryan outright shoved fistful of shit into
everyone's faces i think that's about the the poll the script sounds like bret keene wrote it
you would do a better job uh which shall be worse tlj or riser skywalker well tlj
successfully destroyed the characters we knew and love and the new characters we didn't care about
but riser skywalker destroys the entire arc and purpose of the whole six movies riser skywalker
wins i thought they already did that at this they kind of did it a bit with tlj too yeah
this is the thing though palpatine coming back is a big deal it's a big fuck you to the ot
so it killed all the characters nothing and then this this movie basically kicks all their corpses
metal metal was in this stream we were doing it earlier and he's just woken up and said morning
hello battle uh that's jeb nickels to you longest and ragumist oh sorry it is jeb nickels
anyone who likes riser skywalker i assume they washed upside down in a seat with pants over
their head shoes on their hands and shits on their feet while shoving popcorn into their bung oh
you don't want to shove popcorn into your bung no yeah what do you guys think of the new sonic
redesign also love you rags no thank you very much that's trying to be to say i think the new sonic
looks great yeah looks really good yeah i'm fine with it myself i got no problems i'd be curious
what fans think if they're okay with it then yeah go for it oh it seems it seems it's unanimous that
everybody really likes it i've heard that old thing was a horrifying creature oh my god um
hey mauler gonna ask a girl to be my girlfriend tomorrow what should i say
in what manner should i present her with the mcmuffin also hi rags hello um see for me it's
hyper contextual depends on the girl uh rags do you have any general presentation device
advice with mcmuffins for girlfriends how you how should you present your mcmuffin to your girlfriend
uh it's your potential girlfriend you want this person to be your girlfriend
um it depends are like are you like strangers or do you know each other i'm gonna assume that
they probably know each other and he's just trying to like you know move it up to the next level
move it up move it on up in there i mean it depends on how well you know it depends on what
your relationship is like now but be personable uh be just it's hard to put into words i guess um
surprising how much honesty pays off yeah just be honest and be forthright don't be too blunt though
and just be a i guess that's kind of the best way to sort of put it don't be like like dull
blunt you know but be be forthcoming and you know be honest and be complementary as listen
be funny you know we got some advice in chat first one is to just say lemme smash
that's uh one option another is uh muffin her bungus and tell her she's beautiful
okay these yeah don't be too don't be too cliche i guess don't likely like you don't
want to come across as if you're following a script you read somewhere but i mean you that's
the thing not all gals are the same that's the old skill says bring flowers there you go
um this could be a way in yeah it kind of depends um it is what i said hyper specifically depends
on the girl it really is yeah it really does depend on the girl um yes some gals take flowers
some guys take flowers is trying too hard so yeah take that bitch to the zoo
thus you always recommend that that's actually not a bad idea take take that bitch to the zoo
you there's a long time for you to be together there's plenty of opportunities for you to
look at things and not like super focus on her so if you ever need to just pause
and think of stuff to say you can always look it's not like you're sitting there awkwardly at
a table together you know you're walking around and looking at stuff and there's a lot of things
to ask her about you know what do you think about this what do you think about that you can comment
on things that you see and see what she says and it's not expensive either and if she hates
animals then you know to ditch her so yeah bitches love animals and if they don't they evil
absolutely and plus it gives you and then if you go anywhere afterwards it will always give you a
fallback of things to talk about so if you ever run out of things to talk about then you could
always talk oh yeah that's right we just went to the zoo and all the stuff that you know was there
there chicks like guys who like animals i have spoken yeah i know that reference
um free super chat so take the money you'll be owed after consuming no chat take them to the
zoo is not rag speak for banging take them to the zoo but it should be
uh free super chat so take the money you'll be owed after consuming the clumsy handling
of these space wizards intended for patricks in rise of skywalker uh jeb was running in the
running behind the dawn only she tripped up trying to find the theme in time magazines
oh jeb obviously jebby uh in in that case jebby uh you're right mauler 24 bad 58 hours is more
like you so all your jabs 58 58 okay all your jabs are belong to us that is an old meme but it
checks out she's trying to say send jabs or voxis wait she's trying to say she's trying to say send
jabs or voxis gets it oh yeah it was when i was uh when i noticed the little voxis in the background
i mean it didn't look like all right you you just racist to puppets i don't know man i'm sorry i don't
know man i know what i saw dude um hey guys i'm sorry about how awful the leaks are i hope you
guys have a good time ripping the movie to shreds ps all hail the magnificent doggo oh hail
uh trying to drink whiskey but i'm laughing too hard at the leaks
uh cheaper by the jebalds someone please make this with jeb and tonal does their little jeblins
this is more of a request for chat can you spam kick jay for a meme i'm making
all right chat you've got your orders so i will say this is this is the late shift for chat i
don't know if they can rile up enough um enough enthusiasm to kick jay you'd think they would
oh rags has gotten its time there you go yeah boy just like all right let me let me get it on this
i like how mel said i'm efapping in public is that legal
kiss jay
there you go jay you've been here you go you're getting real healthy here kylo didn't kill himself
uh that's not ra there's no rooftop oh i'm actually the sun god is a hawkman not a squid
true but uh you said it was like a hillbilly squid thing that drawing i guess oh this is the
meme release squidbillies yeah uh why does everyone think jesus died on a cross rah threw him off a
roof oh okay big disavow on that last super chat ra did not throw jesus off of roof
we have won the great twitter war of the 2019 long men oh yes it was a glorious day um ra is
like the doctor but a roof instead of the tardis his roof can take him anyway yeah no video made
meme sad face next time possibly no blast for me on my watch that being said yes i think the
winged demons is a good look versus chad aesthetic egyptian so we get the cultural context for
roof tossing and a cosmic connection to the cosmic chicken by way of horrors oh ras thought this
through um i've got more money to throw at you mauler you didn't get to my last super chat
yesterday here are the questions why you no excite for eldon ring ewoks oh wait so i don't
know what eldon ring is that's probably why i'm not excited for that do you guys know what eldon
ring is not a clue all right ewoks or gungans uh i prefer ewoks but gungans seem to have better
technology uh so you know it's tough but in terms of company probably gungans because they can speak
better english there's a lot of different things to take into consideration uh what are the
objective flaws with return of the jedi there's a whole bunch in the opening half an hour in terms
of what the hell was the good guy's plans and then there's these other things but i mean
that would probably be the main focus i would have in looking into it again but i'd need to
really go through it it is a very confusing opening plan uh this channel is now approved
for it approved for imperial citizens excellent also we now have about 15 minutes
gonna have to try and speed it up hello mauler and co also hi rags
could y'all hello could y'all tell us some deep lore you might know from your favorite franchises
slash ip's deep lore deep lore from your favorite franchises or ip's
let me see deep lore um
give me a second to think about that one moment come on got some hot pockets um
i mean a lot of the ones are gonna be stuff we already talked about because like star wars
not not really doable game of thrones is not um i guess okay here's here's here's a thing um
the the uh i believe this is how it goes but tywin's dad titos uh despite having the lion as
the sigil for their family uh was on a walk in some way once and uh he was attacked by a lion
in their sort of countryside and terrified of it and running away from it and then um
a man saved him and it's like a super embarrassing thing to have happen because
obviously sigil and a guy saved him with two hounds i think it was and it was uh the clagaine
family and that's why they've been so closely connected with the lannisters i remember looking
into that at some point so that's a thing um and then yeah rags said he's gonna think about it i
guess yeah i don't know i don't have a heck of a heck have a heck of a lot to uh contribute to
that conversation because like a lot of a lot of what i look into like i don't focus on a lot of
tv shows and stuff a lot of what i like are like video games and they're the kind of the ones that
everybody's played so i'm kind of a simpleton and i really want to come up with a good answer but
i'm struggling like i gotta admit it right now you're not even a nerd
i'm stretched across a lot of stuff so i'm not really sure um deep lore i'm i'm not into the
lore for a lot of stuff so much that i'd be familiar with most deep lore whether it's
it's got witcher doom war hammer mass effect any of that stuff i just not super super into it
apparently it was three hounds yeah that might be right like i said i can barely remember that i
just remember liking the story uh he stays aloof makes people fly his boat is a roof he's our
god of the sky all hail almighty rah bill gegyptus bag ferronians i got it jay you think
spaceballs is a bad movie oh i read that one out jesus is a mary sue he deserved to be punished rah
guest five will get to accompany me to the pearly gates and get yeeted from me
there on high oh that was in response to that super chat um all the two films jay's scene have
been sniders oh rah at rags an ass load ooh all right i don't know man i my uh my ass loads are
pretty uh voluminous also yeah we got a lot better man we've got literally about the way this works
10 it's like 20 just just about 20 minutes if we really push it so i'm gonna have to really
we're on the last page oh shit go so yeah i'm gonna i'm just gonna rush these but what's gonna
happen right if we don't make it it's fine i'm just gonna start where we left off on the next defap
uh when we get the super chat section hopefully it won't double up we'll be fine okay so we got
two freebies for you thanks for the hours of entertainment you absolute massives thank you
thank you thank you playing doom on 150 fps is a drug trip oh i know the first time you see it boy
yeah this is from someone first time it's from someone called das bosh no idea who this is it
says free super chat expires soon high rags hey hey stupid fucking name yeah that guy sucks yeah
wong man cute oh yes i know what's that's that's see like we're in the super chats part of the
super chats now thoughts on using emulators i use them for older games they're unavailable
on pc and are simply no longer for sale on any platform absolutely go for it absolutely not to
mention uh if you're able let's say you have a gamecube and you can play mario sunshine on it
whatever get it on the emulator too because you can play that way higher specs or at least uh
presentation um yeah it's funny you should mention that because i had a friend over just yesterday
and um we decided we really really wanted to play mario kart double dash on the gamecube and he found
the uh the dolphin emulator and we were able to get that sucker going like the anti-aliasing was
really good we were able to get it into like 1080p looked pretty freaking good dude it's quite crazy
oh yeah like that i played a shit ton of gameboy advanced games on emulators i've beaten like two
pokemon games and like all the early fire emblem games on it and other stuff yeah emulators are
wonderful uh but yeah go for it free fap 66 you should watch backstroke of the west finally or
at least do an efap mini you need to see the grand adventure of ratio tile and a la gold
there's a good chance it'll be in efap movies to be honest with you um pokemon info people are
upset but once people start playing the game a lot of the problems fade into the actual good story
all right uh-huh star war robot chicken has a more believable storyline than this movie
it's probably the same for the family guy star wars movies as well i believe it
i'm sorry i used to be subscribed to movie bob
you're forgiven you are forgiven uh critique the plot of a bad erotic film for efap 69
um sure it's not like i would be down for that yeah uh my dog this ring yeah oh this isn't fun
my dog died in my arms a few hours ago your stream always makes me feel good and is helping
with the grief uh oh man i'm really really sorry to hear that man keep up a good wiki message yeah
man you know sorry to hear that sure he was a very good boy he dogs are the best live on in
your memory don't let him fade rest is on you now uh efap card game update 95 complete 652 cards
printed and cut out cards for game balance testing should be ready in two maybe three weeks
wow he's really going all in i'm all scared by this thing i don't know what's going to happen
sounds intense uh hello mauler and rags hello hello what actors would you pick to play yourselves
in a movie oh um obviously danny devito
in a dog danny devito in a dog costume
danny devito in a fursuit get that guy who plays lich in the adams family movies he's
like the tallest actor there is do that make him wear clothes that are striped as well that
go straight down uh jay likes hawaiian pizza therefore his opinion is wrong and his management
should be questioned that's an answer oh i was i was thinking about it and we moved on um
fuck um you're not getting away with oh wait um who's that guy um tim curry yeah i want to be
tim curry okay um jay likes hawaiian pizza therefore his opinion is wrong and his management
should be questioned oh his management's always been questioned yeah there's never been a time
where we were questioning that shit hello my n-words what is your favorite movie to watch while
drunk and a big fat girthy hello to rags mmm thank you um daddy mostly i way prefer watching
comedies when drunk and there's a whole bunch of uh good ones that work um i like to watch i
watched thor ragnarok for the second time while drunk that was great oh yeah we watched that
together it was uh just pure entertainment um yeah what about you guys um sorry epap is my favorite
yeah movie watch drunk okay that's a long movie you mean a more traditional movie though um
what is the question was what movie do we like to watch drunk yeah
not probably some bad terrible movie oh yeah those two terrible i don't know resident evil
fill in the blank i don't know how many of them are who fucking knows anymore
um just me or does no bullshit sound different outside of his videos
he's using a different mic obviously i was gonna say uh uh it's probable i mean you might use
filters or whatever right like or some basic filters on on your videos maybe well i imagine
he he you know he sets his mic up and he's got it in a very particular way he sets up maybe he
records in a closet like some people do when he sounds yeah yeah so that's what that is
no doubt about it i mean he sounds awful either way
a friend unironically told me that my opinion on tlj was invalid because i watch anti-tlj video
essayists implication being that i like tlj before seeing your content how do people think like this
uh people live in a world where they don't think that minds can be chained
yeah so there's that yeah it's like you you just watch these videos it's like well these
videos convinced me and i and i believe them yeah that's happened that's happened to me plenty
at times with uh media i'll watch a video deconstructing i'll be like oh fuck okay yeah
yeah i didn't think about that and i can't think of a good rebuttal you know so there you go uh
how much money would you need to be paid for you to chew on a piece of chewing gum that someone
had spat out into a urinal you can't rinse the gum beforehand and it must be for 30 consecutive
seconds say that one more time how much money would you need to be paid for you to chew on a
piece of chewing gum that someone has spat out into a urinal you can't rinse the gum beforehand
and it must be chewed for 30 consecutive seconds how much money oh that's tough i i don't i mean i
don't i mean i'd do it i'd do it for a million bucks i think most people would do it for that
i'd do it for 10 million dollars so no less than a million huh
i don't know i mean probably i'd say almost certainly i'd probably go as low as maybe a
thousand as long as i don't swallow anything and clean my mouth immediately afterwards yeah
that's what i'm thinking it's like because you seem to be allowed to spit and like wash your
mouth afterwards as long as you can hang in there for 30 30 seconds is a pretty reasonable amount of
time yeah and it doesn't say you have to chew vigorously or anything and you don't have to
swallow nope and hey maybe the maybe the urinal is relatively clean yeah and you can hold your
nose closed so you don't smell it or taste it so thousands all right yeah i'll go with a thousand
because it's pretty nasty yeah it's pretty nasty uh hearing jay hog down his junk food makes me
want to unironically go brad pit at the end of once upon a time in hollywood mode rl right now
all right thank you for the content have some free money thank you uh atlas shrugged was
basically twilight for assholes but with 10 more rape okay okay uh good stream take a little bit
more of my money now i'm actually broke also remember kiddies star wars is a film franchise
ended in 1983 it ends at a different point for everybody i know that a lot of people will say
i remember people it ended at tlj we never got this nonsense we'll be like oh yeah okay it ended
with a good one so we got 14 minutes oh i don't think we're gonna be able to make this so like i
said uh when we hit around 14 minutes i'll probably end the stream and like i said we will
catch up from where we left off um but i'll get through as many as i can i thought val and hulk
were more of a thing than val and thor uh they set both of them in a way to a degree but i always
thought that valkyrie and hulk uh thor had had more of a thing um but maybe in episode nine finn will
say he was cleaning snoke's toilet and he saw palpatine's ghost and he'll know how to beat palpatine
we can only hope and i'll say they will have an opportunity to really explore the psyche of
thor a lot because mantis will be with them and she's good for that character stuff
absolutely uh rags theory yeah camarilla are punishing v thus he has been absent and amil
tuned him in please mention at next episode i'm curious if others agree
uh it's possible that that's a real world explanation for it but we haven't been getting
given uh given any specifics by the gm perhaps v will return one day to our campaign we are not
certain and so for now we are just essentially just carrying on as if he has vanished
he did a dom though he did a few doms hey jay i was the guy who said my friend loved another
life because it was classic great sci-fi turns out she was just trying to get me to watch it she
still loves it on uh ironically oh there you go uh hi rags caught you and mauler on dp earlier
this month i heard of that bizarre mcdonald's story some time ago what the fuck also jared
is a pedo now um i don't know if he's a pedo he got uh banned recently from what i heard
apparently he showed porn on his stream and got banned that's what one of the other super chads
don't do that jared yeah don't do that jared uh lovey mauler and rags you are dead to me jay
foxy robin hood is my favorite film oh i was from uh keeper kids the efap.me guy
yeah jay piece of shit watch everything already
uh at the two dollar tier youtube is charging four cents per character for a super chat at the
500 here youtube charges a whopping one dollar 50 uh 43 per character i thought palpatine was evil
oh my my goodness let me clarify my friend will be shook because he spent months brainwashing me
into watching efap and it actually worked hi uh sorry hi kirky kirky you apparently convinced
this person to get into efap how could you do that what a goodman she is a disney princess
is that referring to ray i don't know uh you think red letter media will finally admit force
awakens his garbage once rise of skywalker comes out red letter media didn't think star wars was
garbage they don't i think their opinions they do nothing but like make fun of it now i think
they've they've gone to the point where they say at tlj's garbage but force awakens i don't know
if they've come around to saying that's garbage i can't remember oh right okay uh if you give jay
a kick he's going to ask you for a glass of rhino milk when you give him the milk he'll
probably ask you for a geode when he's finished he'll ask you to watch another life good night
massives that's yeah jay is full of surprises it's undeniable uh movie bulb probably smells
like cigarettes and old cheese but i think that's that's pretty strong as a descriptor actually
cigarettes and old cheese yeah i can already smell it uh just finished the new batwoman
she hangs a gay flag it's so bad i can't wait for a two-hour mini also high rags and kick

really good and relatable all right i'm a galactic hero so that rags if you want some
good fairy dads look up hrothgar from final fantasy uh 14 handsome cat dads yes the new
the new man oh yeah i've seen some of them oh yeah they decided to branch out from the
five human races with varying degrees of ear sizes and neck sizes and went yeah that's one
thing i really hated about final fantasy 14 is like what kind of human do you want to play and
like oh is this it they're all they're all pretty be it and then they're like okay well here's a
furry he's like okay okay well now you're now you're mixing things up a little uh mad lib time
efab give me an adverb adjective now an adjective now now an adverb hope you guys are having
enjoyable lives may the dawn be with you yeah it's gonna take a while um you want us to give
an advert uh you might save that for later you know what i actually will i'll just gonna copy
that and put it somewhere i will address it at some point it'll happen i swear to god
if we are to actually find a way of giving a strong answer to that um okay here is money
thank you short man good long man bad i disagree do you guys own pets if so what kinds
of pets i do not have pets i do not currently don't i'm thinking of having a dog um but i live
on my own and i kind of get concerned on whether or not i'm gonna take a trip and who's gonna help
me take care of it while i'm gone and that just kind of bugs me plus i want it to have a yard
i feel the same way about those two things actually yeah um have you guys considered
being an alternative platforms also high regs hey we will probably transfer to another platform
if youtube boots us off right now we'll just stay here um yeah we we don't have um you don't
have a reason to go yet it's all a dream dudes well maybe jeb and the holograms jeb is truly
outrageous truly truly truly outrageous that's a reference to tarik i know my league of legends
still even though that that that's that's actually referencing something else i just
know it more so from league of legends at this point uh have you seen hannibal tv series if so
thoughts pretty good i only saw the first two seasons i've heard that it doesn't end fantastically
have not seen no there you go yeah i i'm not i haven't seen it um
um have you seen hand oh sorry uh here's the last of my free youtube money can i send it to
wolf who's kitten wallace kitten uh yes oh yeah wolf as a kitten i've seen a couple photos that's
a cute little guy cute catman yeah um here's another on youtube's tab who would win in a
fight of captain marvel or ray they both have their plot armor also high rags and mauler
hey so the thing that ray has over captain marvel is the force and by that i'm actually referring
to the force as an entity will allow ray to win anything captain marvel may have the power of the
universe but what can that do against the best plot armor in the money can buy and let's be frank
now the legions of the undead she's got a lot of undead for the captain marvel to battle so
uh yeah i'd honestly probably go with ray in terms of writing in terms of power level
it's tough man to actually really be honest about it with how stupid everything is for ray in these
movies like i don't know um can we still view your jedi fallen order stream yes use the link
in the description to get to the discord and once you're in the discord you can find it through
the channel watto's junkyard i threw all of my unlisted gaming streams in there
troglodytes are basically tismy lizard men of dnd oh there you go okay yeah that's what i thought
uh you need to cuck nando versus movies joker video it's a disgrace to the movie he must be
punished by the toxic brood kill it with memes i have seen uh of this video i heard of this video

outro and then i'll save the rest for next time we only have we only only have about 30 left
