and we're up and we're up it's been so long you know a whole week without an
epheb I don't know how people survive I don't know how they do it you're almost
at 100k I am this usually streams knock off a few subscribers because obviously
people are like what he streams that's not what I signed up for which is fine
I'm just saying that uh it probably about two or three days and then I will
have reached 100k which is quite a thing I'll probably have to do a stream of
some kind celebrating I guess
also a Q&A who doesn't love Q&A yeah I I do love them good only if there's good
questions though
hello everybody oh yeah I've got a new icon now that'll be the first time in
epheb that you can see it thanks to the old fan art I'm afraid people who follow
the skull on wheels law are gonna have a little bit more difficulty accounting
for this one but you can make it work and for all we know you know what is it
called on a car when you have like the little is it like a hood ornament you
could argue that this is my hood ornament on the car and it's just really
zoomed in so yeah yellow fine yes it is it is me and rags this time around this
is probably the only epheb will have just two of us because I mean me and him
could talk more than enough for like five people with this topic and then
we've got loads of guests lined up and of course most of you hopefully would
have seen Wolf's video and he's he's taking a break from YouTube it's
undisclosed exactly how long he plans to but he'll happily come back to epheb and
of course making videos on his channel I imagine once once he's sort of feeling a
bit better about it so today we'll be continuing with mr. TRO's video for
we're not necessarily gonna complete the video we're gonna go for this is just
part two and this may end up being the shortest defab considering the last one
was six hours and yeah it was that's like earlier it was it was really
repetitious and there wasn't a lot of substance really in it we kept repeating
ourselves over and over and it was sort of getting to the point we're like okay
can we use so we'll go for I don't know a couple hours or whatever depends on
what the video says I hope it's better than last I've actually heard because I
haven't seen it but I've heard that they do actually talk about Star Wars like
actual points in the film so we'll be able to respond to stuff like that yeah
first of all though we we decided to just check out the comment section and
I've got a selection on screen that me and Rags just gonna look through we find
interesting considering some of the things that have been said in the video
so I suppose if you want to start Rags with the Lord Doom comment is it yeah I
think this is a good one to start out with this one is this is by Lord Doom 10
Wow just Wow the level of unprofessionalism from Rags is just
inexcusable and exactly what IHU is complaining about concerning toxic
behavior from those that didn't like the film so that's what we want to start out
with because this one points out just how toxic the behavior is from people
who didn't like the film because as we've as we know it's not the people who
did like the film who were being toxic and refusing debates so now that we've
set the stage let's take a look some of these are great we'll scroll right to
the top is it yeah pilot Rags is so smug I want to slug him in the arm but then
he'd take my threat seriously say so you respond to my opinions with violence and
then try to dissect it for 10 minutes with straw man argument well here's the
thing if I was to say so you respond to my opinions with violence that's not me
taking your threat seriously that's just me being a bit Socratic but not
just asking you exactly why is that what you're why is that what you would think
why is that what comes to your mind why would you even want to slug me in the
arm I don't think you're gonna do it and I'm just asking you why do you want to
do story highlight the I hate everything's premise for his video is
that people are being a bit too you know over the top about the Last Jedi and
then TRO backs that up with as you can see with the Last Jedi as much more
toxic than any other subject you must do it you have to admit that and it's
like yeah just with the subject of talking about Rags as a youtuber we've
already got a threat here and he'd be like oh I can't believe you taking it as
a threat what all I said was I'd punch him in the arm it's like what do you
think that is in real life if you punch someone in the arm do you think that
people go thank you for that it's not really how that works there are tons of
people that I don't like on YouTube I don't want to hit them this thing I don't
even I don't even what have the desire to hit them that's the thing but
remember all of these all of this is based off of the idea that we're the
toxic ones I remember it's not like these up voted comments you know these
all have zero point oh oh 136 okay and it's not as blatant it's not like the
actual comment said something as strictly as I just want to punch him you
know lucky we have no comments like that you want to move on to the next
yeah so next my spots would I just want to punch that smug dog all right 44 of
us so 45 at least 45 people want to punch me so we're up to almost 200
people want to punch me which is which sounds about right which sounds about
beholder says I used to like rags but god he's so pretentious and narcissistic
they call me Joe well I mean maybe a little I don't know about pretentious
though I mean like Peter some people call me arrogant like yeah I'm a bit
arrogant yeah I'm a little arrogant yeah I'm a little arrogant narcissistic yeah
sort of most of most of it is just like the character people who talked to me
either IRL or in discord or stuff I know I'm pretty easygoing like the
difference between assert assertive and aggressive it's like how do you tell the
difference it's like well I mean most people would like to say they're
assertive rather than aggressive but you can aggressive has a more negative
connotation than assertive yeah to be fair so in the chat said to be fair you
were pretentious as in you had the pretense of being right oh right true
and then I followed through on it and then we made the six-hour stream a week
ago yes and then we wanted to just die next up they call me Jojo says I never
watched rags prior to this but okay so we very learned but the way how he the
way how he talks already makes me dislike him all right I don't know he
sounds like the type of person who would treat others like pure shit for not
sharing his own opinion while doing it with a smile on his face oh so I'm
friendly yeah at least you got that I'm friendly yeah I'm a nice guy we can
disagree about things that's all right besides it after all it's not Mahler and
I who are the ones who say that you're not allowed to have a certain opinion or
that you can watch movies the wrong way or things like that lucky says good old
rags his ego seems super high in the sheer amount of hypocrisy and lack of
self-awareness is astounding maybe that will maybe that will be pointed out to
us hmm we'll get there at some point that's got to be in the video somewhere
I'm sure it's there somewhere cane can edgy says rags is an annoying entitled
contrarian PC elitist I don't know about contrarian damn your PC days man they're
just yeah I still get yeah I'm still getting flack for the PC videos I don't
know about contrarian though I would want some follow-up on how I'm contrarian
yeah sometimes I'll play the devil's advocate just to like get what people
are trying like why they think the way they do but that's just so I can learn
the way they you know how their thought process works I don't really think I'm
contrarian I have not found you to be contrarian but then again maybe I'm
biased cuz I'm your friend oh but buddy as someone says at some point I can't
remember if that's in this list or not but hey
um people like rags are the reasons we can't have opinions anymore so rags is
is a part of this effort to prevent people from having opinions so thanks
rags for that you've ruined it you've ruined the internet I'm sorry I didn't
mean to ruin it it just happened although I'll watch that in the future
look at this one rags is an idiot and that's an objective opinion hey so so
good top meme rags opinions are aligned with the average 11 year old on the
internet he follows the mob mentality and nothing more strange I would be
curious what opinions are of the average 11 year old on the internet or what
gives that impression yeah but as for the mob mentality I don't know like I've
definitely changed my mind about things I've had my mind change about certain
things and you know there's probably an opinion me and rags hold that 11 year
olds do hold possible someone I think what's interesting when it comes to the
last Jedi I don't know I don't think either side is the mob mentality I mean
maybe if you make your opinion for certain reasons it's a mob mentality but
there's I mean there's two there's two pretty well-established camps as to if
you know if it was a good quality or a poor quality film I wouldn't I wouldn't
say just because you necessarily are on either side that's because of a mob
mentality well like we can just throw this out straight away like when you what
do you think of the last Jedi honestly rags I do not think it was a good film
well too bad because apparently that's what the mob is saying right now which
means you're just following the mob I guess to sum it up rags is being a
cynical nitpicky self-righteous self-entitled know-it-all toward IHE's
views on the last Jedi claiming that his views are the true reality of things and
IHE's opinions aren't actually opinions that matter that's interesting I'm sorry
that you got that impression I just don't remember you saying those things
that's all that's where I'm lost I'm I don't either but I am certain beyond
the shadow of a doubt that it will be elaborated upon later hmm change your
minds but I'm sorry that you got that a view from my video though this isn't
this isn't a comment on my video this is a comment on me through the lens of TRO
well then the way the video structured is very unusual I think you should start
to notice like the reason we're responding to these like wow you know
like this is quite the quite the picture that's been painted of rags to make all
these people say these things like especially the one that was like I've
never even seen rags before but he's clearly this it's like hmm yeah it's
very odd let's see we already talked about Lord Doom talking about the toxic
behavior from those who didn't like the film yeah yeah and then we got
politically incorrect says has rags commented on or responded to this video
in any way shape or form I wouldn't know if he saw it and apparently mauler my
butt buddy for which we are and he said yes so it's official mauler did and had
the audacity to criticize this video the audacity imagine thinking that other
people are pretentious and self-righteous and narcissistic but they have the
audacity to criticize the video very strange we're not we're not really
getting like this cohesive picture that's just embarrassing to be catching
yourself saying that you require like massive audacity to criticize some
things like oh dear yeah I wish it we should encourage people to criticize
stuff even if it's from people that we enjoy or whether it's low hanging fruit
or high hanging fruit you know or however deep we want to get I think that
one of the positive aspects of the Last Jedi is that it does act as kind of like
a conversation starter to get people talking about film quality yeah really
looking into you know good criticism of a film and it just just instead of
reading out the entire thing it just skips down to what's sad about mauler is
that if anyone questions anything that he and his friends do he challenges them
to a stupid debate I mean it's like dude grow the fuck up can you imagine oh can
you imagine wanting to debate people and having a discussion with people it's
just sad I mean the way the other debates I mean to be fair so far the
other debates that you've you and wolf and myself and everything that we've had
with people maybe if I'd seen those I wouldn't be so ready to jump into one
either well they've been civil they've just they were civil yes they were
civil they've just it's kind of like one-sided usually unprepared and
obviously me and wolf no last Jedi back to front so when people walk in
unprepared it can come across as almost like why was this debate taking place
but every time they're always just impromptu the orders just they just
happen they were never planned yeah and it's even even the not so great debate
was good because you get him to think about you know the wise it's like we
it's it's almost like it's not it's not so important what you think of the film
it's how did you get to that hmm how did can you explain how you got to that
point right and you know just it's just highlighted the bottom two sentences
from the next one
bottom two let's see oh I'll be the whole thing ranks is just another dip
shit YouTube skeptic and those are in caps damn who uses the same method of
arguing with normal people as he does with a rational fat blue haired
feminists and that method simply does not work with normal people I don't know
I don't know what that method actually means I hope he's not referring to the
Socratic method because I'll be embarrassing it's like it doesn't work
on normal people because I've gone on like the non sequitur showing stuff and
I just asked people questions because that it reveals a lot about the way
people think and how they get to their positions but again when will these
skeptics learn that not everyone is a native Sarkeesian and it is possible to
disagree with people without having to extrapolate insidious meanings behind
every statement that you disagree with I personally don't like the Last Jedi
however IHE's video on it is perfectly valid as it's from the opinion of
someone who did enjoy it and he explains why he liked it not really sure we'll
let that go yeah whereas rags and mauler acts like their opinions are facts that
can't be argued against in any opinion that doesn't align with theirs is
objectively wrong how arrogant self-aggrandizing and smug do you have to
be to act like your opinion on a piece of entertainment is the only opinion
that's valid and I don't recall ever saying that yeah you could tell that
that almost feels like it was like Quentin saying it which again yeah I
think I think speed boost has the only knowledge he may ever have of you or I
is what he has heard from Quentin yeah he doesn't actually know anything about
us or what we think but he thinks that he knows because maybe somebody else said
it that he likes or agrees with or he's just been convinced of it or he's just
kind of accepted it for bad reasons it's really a shame when people say this
stuff over and over and it simply isn't true this is just stuff we've never said
in fact during our efaps and this is number nine I believe
countless times we've responded to videos and those videos constantly do the things
that we are getting accused of and we have to argue against those things we argue against
the things that people say that we do what a shame what a shame
this is the this the last Jedi hate train made me realize that there are a lot of content
creators like rags that is honored wolf mauler and er who love to insult everyone who has a
different opinion and pushes their politics into everything see I feel like they could have just
switched out any of the names and people would have just agreed it's like clearly they don't
watch my stuff if they think I push politics into all my videos because it's one of the
principles of my channel political yeah you're very apolitical um wolf does sometimes I do
sometimes um I think that when you look at the last Jedi you can definitely take away some
political messages I think that they're pushing something political in the film I'd like to
avoid saying whether or not I approve of the politics that they're actually pushing but let's
be honest they they have there's quite an anti-capitalist message in canto bite which is like
okay because you know you're not gonna catch me in rags saying the capitalism is flawless but
it's just like okay that's there we can see that an anti-animal cruelty it's like that's obviously
I don't think you'll find many people disagreeing with that as a policy but yeah yeah there's not
there's not a really big camp that's pro animal cruelty that's the thing which makes you wonder
why bother um I guess they really wanted to let it's almost like it's a cheap thing you know it's
like an orphanage or something well yeah especially with the slavery aspect they break
out the animals but leave the kids behind it's like oh all right very strange um well the kids
could grow up to be capitalists well as we know from the end of the movie those slave kids are
going to be the new jedi use their broomsticks and uh save the world probably feel dumb for leaving
them behind um pushes their politics yeah I I don't think that's true at all and if anything
I think we've seen a lot of politics from people who defend it a lot of them will defend it based
off of political it's like um that's bullshit said he's watched every one of my videos and he
doesn't know where I lead politically exactly yeah yeah that's the thing mauler's so he mauler's
very apolitical but you know you make a video criticizing black panther and that's like people
take that as a political stance if you don't like black panther it is a and I don't buy the
bullshit that everything is political I don't I don't buy into that oh well it's the same as
everything is subjective it's like let me just give you one statement that's apolitical uh the
last jedi is a movie like uh oh yeah I I don't I don't follow the line of reasoning that because
any creator has political opinions or they live in a certain political climate that it must
necessarily have an actual effect on every piece of media that they produce without exception I
definitely don't buy that and if it was true and everything was political then it's pointless to
say it because it wouldn't even matter why have a word for it um it just seems so watered down
and pointless but that's a discussion for another time maybe I'll explore it later um I think extra
credits did a video on it um but we'll see uh charles gee or gee says thank you guys so much
for this very cathartic for me I'm a fan of both rags and mauler but I lost a huge amount of respect
for both of them for letting their hatred of a film distort how they perceive objective reality
that's a very interesting I see it as a reverse but hey sure that is a very interesting thing to
say um I disagreed so much with rags logic and malicious nature in that video well I give as I
I get I just find it's like if you're malicious then what is Quinton in this video yeah that's
that's very strange um on top of the huge amount of hypocrisy he showed that it led to my first
youtube comment I was compelled to call out that BS even if not as well articulated as this lol
well I don't think that not being as well articulated as the right opinions video here
I don't think that's too much to be ashamed of yeah I know in his top comment even like apologizes
for the editing and the music and I was like oh wow actually I guess he knew about it but he didn't
sort of change it yeah um Guillerme Berlies I guess Guillerme Berlies oh the last one right
yeah which is am I the only one that noticed TRO did pretty much every single thing he accused
rags of doing in this video you know Guillerme you aren't the only person who noticed that
you aren't the only person who noticed that it's funny because that's the only comment from six
days basically that's the only comment post efap the rest of them before they anyone saw us
actually respond to it oh except for the four minute no that's not four minutes it's four months
yep all of them are from before so like we're injecting a little bit of sanity into this
comment section by responding to the video and uh yeah I think the takeaway told me about this
the takeaway is not only is um it proof that basically any comment section anywhere on the
internet is going to have horrible shit to be able to snap just like I hate everything snapped
but uh secondly me and me and rags have found comments that the lowest you'll get is like
10 up votes but some of the highest are like nearly 200 and they're all very negative towards
rags's character and some of them want to punch him so it's like what's interesting too is that
the right opinion finds comments in his video to use as evidence that are months old and have
no up votes no one has seen them nobody cares about them and here we are with comments that
actually you know have some traction in the video at least yeah I think if anything the
comment section of the right opinions video is that some people will clap at anything
well my theory is that it's acted as a lightning rod against you for people who don't like you in
a similar way that um again I think you're right yeah I like cinema sins a lot but like his video
acted as a lightning rod for people who just don't like me I don't think you don't even know
if they care about my Black Panther video they just don't like me and so they're like oh you know
what a video criticizing them sure let's go for it yeah I get that impression a lot I think that um
I think they just sort of latch onto it I wonder how much actual thought went into
the listening process of what was being said because when you actually listen to it it's really
bad anyway we were at I believe 51 minutes uh so we'll we'll pick it up at around there
and uh see how it goes we'll try and be a little bit more liberal this time and let the video play
a bit more but I mean we should have covered most stuff if they end up repeating it like
we'll just say please see the previous part if you want to see us respond to the the accusation
every time that we don't let people have opinions yeah as long as new stuff starts popping up we'll
probably keep on rolling all right you ready Rex oh I'm I was born ready excellent and yeah I'll
if if Rex wants to have a toilet break at any point or if we just take a break I'll read the
super chats but um for now we'll just let carry on since we're 24 minutes in that's not so bad
considering we've only been talking about the actual stuff so yeah I'm proud already detail
on bungee's new entry in the hugely popular destiny franchise you made a 49 minute video
review of destiny just to clarify this is his music right oh yeah I don't use music yeah I was
gonna say I don't remember using music and it's just like why I very rarely use music it's at the
like maybe the very beginning and then it trails away or at the very end for like like the last
moments of the video but I don't have generally music going over what I'm talking about especially
if it's not especially if it's like this music like no and like it might be because we've
watched this video so so detailedly but like that music is grinding on my brain like the
oh my god it's and don't confuse us we're not this isn't like a criticism of any points he's
making we're just saying if you make videos don't have music like this in the background as you're
talking just throughout the whole it's really it's annoying like just appreciate the quiet
just because there's not music doesn't mean there needs to be music to where you admit to being
nitpicky about it and countless countless hours must have been spent editing compiling all of
that footage putting your thoughts together and making those into a movie but if you watch the
destiny 2 video for his evaluation he takes into account the context and intent that he says is
being ignored in this video nitpicking for fun is fine i don't think many are going to dispute that
as long as you come to a conclusion that doesn't rely on them alone i would love to know why not
why can't first off nitpicking hasn't been defined so he might be talking about two completely
different things but if a movie is full of nitpicks and those nitpicks pile up and pile up and pile up
then eventually you're going to get to a breaking point or that point is it depends on the
individual viewer some people can put up with a lot of them some people can't put up with a lot of
them but that's up to each individual person to determine i'm not sure but an epic is still a
problem not sure about his counter there as well because like from what i just gathered you you
basically just point out i and everything's complaining about x and he does x in his destiny
2 video simple and then tro responds with yes but that was his intent to do that in this video and
not in the start videos like that doesn't count what rex said yeah i i i'm curious too how that
counters it i'll be like me saying you know i intend to share that killing people is wrong
and then tomorrow i intend to kill people the intention matters if you're if you're a channel
like cinema sins and maybe you go into a video thinking that your criticisms will be funny
hahaha i make laughs but also a lot of those criticisms are actually solid and sound ones
then your intent doesn't really matter i mean you just point out a hypocritical perspective you
don't it doesn't matter what if his intention was to be hypocritical you would still be accurate
yeah a bit weird it's very you know why your
nitpicking of destiny 2 is completely justified but anybody else's criticism of a movie that you
liked is absolutely not helpful unacceptable not constructive a casual observer might perhaps call
you a hypocrite for saying such things just because something is long doesn't mean that it
preoccupies itself with only nitpicks i didn't say that i didn't say that i didn't say that i said
the video had a lot of nitpicks in it and and i didn't i didn't even have to say that you're
pro that video right yeah and i like the destiny video that's the thing i like his destiny video
i was pointing out that i h e points out himself that he was being nitpicky
bizarre i think they got the wrong impression of you with the destiny video just to clarify for
anybody who's confused rags likes uh i hate everything's destiny video he thinks it's good
his destiny video was really really good i really like it and as someone in the comment says yeah
it does it does get tired pointing out all these inconsistencies it it is a little exhausting that's
why we're probably not gonna go six hours today what's the thing i get the impression just a little
bit right but if you were told rags argue against somebody no matter what they say and then they go
the sun is a star and then you go it's only a star by definition of what books have been created in
our current uh species history you'd be like you know yes that's kind of what i feel like tro's
video is it's like defend this at all costs yeah it's like that wasn't hard to agree with you on
it's like oh yeah he did do a video this essentially could easily you said even may
perhaps you didn't say definitively but it's like i hate everything creates a video that
could easily be be considered the video he's criticizing right now in his video and the thing
that i find most interesting is that i everything does admit this at the end of his video he says
that he's a part of the problem and that's the thing i don't i don't think necessarily i mean
i don't think nitpicks are bad i don't think they're part of the problem again it hasn't been
defined but if anything nitpick is it's almost like i think we talked about this last week
where a nitpick is what you call something that you agree with but you would kind of dismiss
he's like oh that's that's just a nitpick he's like oh so i'm right well yeah that's the thing
nitpick usually means it's valid but it's inconsequential something like that yeah it
depends on who you'd ask and it and whether or not you should talk about a nitpick is just down to
the people it's like hey rags are you interested to find out in which scene in lord of the rings
you can see a car really far in the background and you'd be like well that's a nitpick you could
say that i'd be like i'm not saying it ruins the films i'm saying do you want to see it it's kind
of interesting to think about that there's a car there yeah it's obviously not an in-universe
error it's a it's a film it's an editing error it's just yeah i mean maybe i mean that might
be a good thing to talk about once nitpicks everybody's got a different amount of interest
in them uh like someone having the wrong shoes in a scene some if you point that out to me with a
screenshot movie i love i'd be like huh do that maybe i can maybe i should tweak that out i should
be like when i say nitpick what comes to your mind you know or what what is a nitpick to you
yeah you could do like a poll have a couple of options see what people mostly think
like you know is it do people think that nitpick means invalid criticism
so it's kind of used like that a lot isn't it because i don't mean it like that if i say it
here i just i just tweeted something out yeah because i kind of want to get some feedback
on this so yeah if you follow my twitter rags underscore yt go for it there you go
jay perspectives folks share give i want i i know that apparently wanting discussion is a bad thing
but i would like some feedback on what you think a nitpick is because it's possible that you just
have two groups talking past each other past each other the length design does not imply high quality
just because two videos are equally long does not mean they're both equal in content as if rags ever
said that two videos being the same length means they're the same in content yeah it's obviously
not what i said that's ridiculous how do people watch how did you extrapolate that from what rags
said jeez wow this then says that it's point of view is that anybody else's criticism of a movie
that you liked is absolutely not helpful unacceptable which is once again not true
it calls them nitpicks yeah it was like you're moving context there yeah you're you've already
framed that statement so we can just move on there's no point observer may call it a hypocrite
i will not not for this at least it then says yeah it may be funny but that doesn't mean it's
helpful criticism it doesn't mean it's unhelpful yeah i know it's a point it doesn't mean it's
unhelpful it's such a nebulous statement not it's like ripping on movies isn't always helpful it's
like okay yeah but it can be that's the thing couldn't you argue it's helpful if it got someone
into a better mood like that alone like say you make a really horrible video but some guy watches
it and feels better it's like could you that argue that at least that it's helpful in that way
well that's that's what that's what i h e says in his video right that it that it made the
happiness in the world go up or something like that oh right well uh just right certainly said
the more criticism you have of movies the less happiness you'll have typically in the world or
something so it's bad it was just right yeah yeah yeah that was awful that that was that's
the bike cock argument and i was just like man come on dude here become increasingly more aware
of this i'm trying to make it more clear that what i say is just my opinion and that doesn't
necessarily mean it's the correct opinion what it jesus i remember seeing that firsthand with i hit
everything i was just like man what are you doing like i hope it's clear that i'm sharing my opinion
it's like you begin every video with the stupid duh duh duh this is my opinion and a lot of things
i had everything says is not his opinion or not not just his opinion we've gone over this in the
past part but uh you can say things that are facts and opinions at the same time it's crazy
i know but i mean people actually don't believe this is a thing so you have to actually provide
examples but like let's just go with the standard the sun is a star that's my opinion and then
someone could be like that's not an opinion that's a fact it's like look at the definition of opinion
it's just a position a perspective you hold it doesn't have to be based on facts it doesn't
have to be based on feelings it could just be anything it's just a position you hold
and yeah they can be all of them that's how it got turned into a defense by the way so someone's
you say for example the last job is amazing someone says no it's not you go oh whoa whoa
that's just my opinion as in i'm not arguing it i'm just telling you how i felt about it and you're
like okay peep some people in the chat are asking what the bike argument is it's probably not a
comic i just let's call it but there was there's a guy named shin who makes comics and he made a
comic i think it was like early this year last year and it and it was big for a little bit
where essentially somebody has their bike stolen and he thinks to himself that i i'm upset that
my bike is stolen but it's okay because the person who stole my bike is probably happier to get my
bike than i am to lose my bike so it's okay not uh so he just walks off like like satisfied
and cathartic because like yeah someone stole my shit but they were probably happy to steal it
so it's okay it's so stupid yeah it's just yeah he i think he even ended up taking it down and
it was ridiculous but yeah that's the bike cook argument it's like it increased the amount of
happiness in the world it's like shut up someone there's someone punching me it's like i can i can
heal that but they probably have a feeling now that'll last with them forever it's like what do
you yeah if if you're happier to punch somebody then they are sad to get punched then it's okay
to punch them i guess i don't know saying that this comment is irrelevant because of the way
he paints his opposition's opinion you're the one who's painting the opposition in terms of these
criticisms to the lowest possible level of legitimacy and leaving it there yeah and so just
in case anyone forgot obviously rags is kind of referencing still the um the fucking will helm
scream argument where he's like people hate the last jedi and so you have this group where it's
like me and a bunch of other people and wolf whatever um and he's like let's check out their
arguments and he takes the fucking one that says there's no will helm scream this film's bad it's
like thanks thanks for that yeah like yeah but don't talk to me about helpful arguments if
you're gonna talk about will helm screams i hate everything never attempted to paint the whole of
the opposition's opinion it just seems like rags culminating well i don't think i don't think i
had everything was like explicitly saying this is every criticism that's ever levied against the
film rags is obviously talking about the what he means by paint is the broad terms that i hate
everything's using like criticism that is clearly an idea that wants to be put across
i mean why else would you use the word paint if you were talking about how he sort of he's
making something look away you paint paint a picture ih himself is just too timid he's only
painting the ridiculous criticisms as ridiculous criticisms and using it to highlight how certain
elements of the discourse have become marked then there's this little cut yeah but he also
didn't do that tro he had a screenshot of people saying that the film was bad for legitimate
reasons and he was like look at this craziness didn't talk about yeah oh and look we got a new
editor it's just weird because this is my picture yeah but the other thing i'm i'm just
i'm such a layman editor i was so proud when i found out how to like clip the little thing and
get the line right and then put it in the garbage can i was like look at the thing i did well this
we've been over this before but one of the biggest problems his editors have is they play your video
in the background when they're talking about you but your video might have clips from i hate
everything and then so it's just playing shit and you're just like sort of like wait what who
what do we yeah it's very confusing with ihc's intro screen in the bin in response to ihc's
comment towards others shielding themselves with satire it was actually a relevant visual then
yeah throw it away throw it away in the bin it's hard to say much about that ihc then says i like
the last jedi get over it rags manages to turn this into a point as if ihc was preemptively
addressing rags saying that i'm not staying up making this video response because you like the
last jedi i'm making it because of the attitude in which you approach criticism following this
point with numerous justifications that i've already addressed and that is fine he has
presupposed them from earlier bias painting the opposition etc suppose them i just watched his
video yeah i think people assume a lot about what you did here like uh like it's some kind of
macchiavellian breakdown when it was just you you watched the video and responded yeah i'm
just responding to what was on someone else's video and of course that doesn't mean rags is
immune to criticism i would never suggest that it's just that it's bizarre that um we said this
before you've got a video about feelings and then a video about your feelings on feelings and then a
video where it's like a complete analysis down to an analytical level with references to narrative
tripling on these feelings feelings it's like what the hell and i it's confusing the way he's editing
yeah but yes this is a response to response to response if anybody was curious yeah
etc etc it wasn't talking it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter
vis of the chat hello v hello v for him though now we get to where it expresses what he liked
about the film he begins with the production value visual effects cinematography and acting
rag strikes the first two off by saying um so disney has lots of money uh people people don't
like that statement right so maybe we need to clarify it's what it means is that um take any
indie films and they struggle to get amazing visual effects because of the fact that they
don't have the money to afford cg you know companies to work at a predetermined contract
to generate a visual that's amazing it's like so does that mean their film is now worse it's
like well that seems a bit unfair they never had the potential to have it in the first place so
it's not really an equal playing field like that you can have all the talents in the world but if
you don't have the budget to do those things it doesn't matter yeah and to me it just seems a
little bit unfair you can't find in processing power you can if you know who to who to approach
and how much money how much time they require you can always buy good cgi and um like i spoken to
my sister's boyfriend who's uh relatively he's doing well cgi art wise he's he worked on pacific
recently and i said to him like if i had loads of money or the money required and the time
required would you be able to find me a group that would guaranteed have good cgi and he was like
well if if it's true that you have infinite time and money then absolutely but it's like so what
if i didn't what if i had infinite time and no money he was like well you're gonna have to find
a friend who'll do it for free like and that's gonna be difficult yeah man it's just it's the
simple thing of like it's not like cinematography which isn't necessarily money it's no yeah look at
um what's a good example you know you know that rebecca black uh that music video friday yeah yeah
yeah that's what happens when you have a lot of money and not a lot of talent yeah it's very
professionally produced but the inherent skill the stuff that matters that's not there and as far
as i know with stuff like black panther or films that are really high budget and yet have bad cgi
as far as i know that this the the companies are rushed um again speaking to my sister's
boyfriend he uh he knew uh the company that worked on airbrushing superman's mustache out of the uh
justice league and he said they were not given the time they needed to do it and it's like oh
i heard it costs like millions and millions of dollars today and this is the thing
me and rag simultaneously then if we were judging justice league unlike tro and quinton
apparently and and i had everything instead of saying the cgi was done badly the person who
did it has you know poor talent with cgi instead of saying that i'd be like he clearly wasn't given
the money and time that he was supposed to have and you can't say that about fucking uh the script
for the last jedi for example because ryan johnson had infinite time or more time than he needed and
he went with his first draft he changed what was it 10 percent as he has been admitted
which is insane by the way um you can't buy a good script as consistently as you can buy
good cgi i i don't know i don't know if anybody would disagree with that
and so i'd rather talk about the substance cgi relies more on just buying power i spoke to um
yms the other day for a bit which was which was neat and i asked him what his perspective on
those elements of filmer and he said well what's the point of cgi it's like it's a visual to
represent the thing that's happening in the story it's like okay and acting and it's like well
that's to portray the characters from the story uh in a way that we can believe they're actually
on screen it's like okay what about the sets and the costumes like well as to portray the story
again it's like oh so all of these elements are in favor of the script the script is the the core
the script is where it all begins everything else is to is to complement the script and that's not
to take away from the amount of talent that's in these things that's that's absolutely not
what i'm trying to do here it's just that when you say the last jedi is great because of its
visuals i'd be like okay so prometheus is great then right it's like what if the room had millions
of money dollars behind it and uh you know these things like
effects and things of that nature should be in service to something more substantive the
characters in the story the script yeah and and it's that is that is a quote from uh george lucas
reset a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing i believe that's what he said
it's just interesting because a lot of people criticize the prequels for that uh but uh no the
room the room did have millions behind it it didn't have millions behind the cgi budget and it had
tommy yso was the director he was the the writer and so that's actually a proof that money does
not buy quality yeah more money does not guarantee quality yeah um but i don't i don't know why you'd
have cgi in the room but you know hopefully that makes it clearer what we're trying to say we're
not saying the people who do all their work on cgi worthless that's just not what we're going for
states that creating the acting as brilliant is setting the bar kind of low now the latter two
aren't read debatable as rags didn't address the cinematography yet and subjectively disputed the
other however the disney has money point is a curious one plenty of films have large budgets
some films that seed visually others fail something could still be perceived as a great
example yeah it is a it is a it's an okay story it's pocahontas but p that that movie was built
around the visuals it wasn't built around the characters of the story it was built around
the visuals and it cost an insane amount of money to do that and you won't catch me
saying like this is the thing avatar's storyline is a bit meh to me like especially being a sort
of retread so like what about the visuals though and i'm like well yeah the visuals were great it
looked like a great movie but you know that's just so surface level guards of how much money
went into it saying that disney has money as it means to seemingly undermine praise of a film if
every film that you can praise the cgi you can it looked great the cgi looked great
it's fine it's just that it's not a very substantive argument compared to the
the issues in the film it's just like again i just want to we did this with i hate everything
in the conversation i'm pretty sure we referenced prometheus uh come if we reference suicide squad
but again that's another film with a high budget of cgi and it's like what are you going to do
when people say like it doesn't matter if the story sucks i love the cgi they're full good
it's like oh it's like oh don't you want there's like don't you want films to be better than that
yeah that's the thing i'd rather strive for a bit more greatness than just sped
enough money on a cgi company and give them enough time and we're good existed and had
money involved it was visually also yeah i'm actually on uh someone just said if anything
bad cgi would be a nitpick uh i think i mentioned the bad cgi black panther in my review at one
point and i remember thinking to myself like if the if the film was great i wouldn't necessarily
give a shit because ultimately i'd just be like uh it's a bad effect they clearly were rushed
whatever at least the the script itself is you know fantastic so it's a shame but again you'd
want to remain consistent in terms of um yeah and and bad cgi can pull you out of the story it can
oh absolutely serve to you know at different levels for different people but it can pull you
out of what you know the world is and so you focus less on the script and the characters
because you're like oh what's that and now you're no longer watching a story so much as
you're identifying a movie for a as a production be good maybe you could set a standard but visuals
are still a fairly mixed bag they're not presumed when going into the cinema money would maybe make
it more of a feat on a proportional way i mean when you when you walk into a star wars movie
you're pretty much i think those people who walk to a big budget star wars movie expect good
visuals i was gonna say like do you expect we're gonna get it they cost a ridiculous amount of
money and we know where the money's going it's gonna be cgi it's gonna be the actors will be
reshoots make sure everything looks amazing just like i don't know i think that there's a fair
expert like episode nine is probably going to be glorious to look at i i doubt that it'll have bad
visuals it's like why well because of how much money is behind the project i'm sorry that's
this is a correlation there cost a lot and it's not again you know because someone's gonna be
like correlation does not equal causation it's like i know i know you see there are exceptions
but i think it's it would be hard to deny that the general prevailing rule is that if you want
visuals of a certain quality you're gonna have to pony up the bucks and it's gonna take time
and processing power then gets the same the less uh the less we focus on graphics and the less we
focus on visuals you know the easier it is for you know people to basically it it raises the
barrier of entry if those are the focuses you know of what to do i just i just hate the idea
that you take an indie film and someone's like well it wasn't that good the visuals are pretty bad
it's like the cgi isn't all there it's just like oh yeah the film that had like 10 000 as a budget
or something just be like that's fair but fine let's you know and you can say these things it's
just uh just seems really unfair to me yeah blair witch you know stuff like that really tiny
budgets and they don't rely on cgi or any of that stuff and they last forever because of it
aren't someone who does a lot of revision it's still the same mark to say that the only thing
that could lead to a movie being stunning is that they had the budget for it no no no i don't say
stunning yeah we never said that quinton not those are sharp though because it's just all you do
jesus i just want you to like respond to something we actually say
yeah that'd be great oh again that would be so good is the theory running around it's like why
wouldn't quinton talk to bull or any point it's like because this none of this lasts he wouldn't
be able to because put this up he wouldn't be able to take you out of context that consistently live
it's like he's got this entire argument prepared and he opens it with um so rags you said that
the only thing that's stunning is the cg and you go no no and then he's just stopped he'd be like
oh like you know what's stunning fucking i don't know what's a good masquerade is stunning and it
the cgi i don't think play it was very it had a lot of practical effects and costumes and sets
you know it's just it's not about cgi you know it like the blair witch like i just mentioned
earlier very very low budget great atmosphere awesome movie you know stunning is amazingly
condescending especially considering that movies like suicide squad a lot of the marvel films and
even the force awakens failed to look nearly as good as the last that's fucking subjective you
idiot how the hell did he just say that yeah that's very interesting mr nothing is nothing
is objective although the last jedi looks better than the force awakens on the majority
of the mcu films okay that makes sense very interesting jedi if there are movies in existence
that have come out recently that have had huge budgets and have not looked good then you cannot
come out and say that the last we said there's nuance to the subject man and besides you don't
even know he's just right so rag says that it costs money and then quinton comes back with yes
but there are films that are paid a lot that don't look as good as other films and it's like well
with black panther their budget was squandered or at least the time was squandered in favor of
infinity war that's what i've heard from production elements right the reason that the cgi in that
film failed is because they put all their time into infinity war instead there's not exactly
we're still not wrong then by that logic yes it's time and money very very tough to deny
that money doesn't play a huge factor yeah and besides we want to talk about the fucking
script it's like what do you want to do talk about whether or not you like the way the thing
looked it's like can we talk about the things that we can actually discuss instead of just saying
whether or not you liked the way it looked please like why are you i just can't believe you
just said that i so hypocritical considering anything else you said in this fucking video
someone in chat says because that idiot rag said that the last jedi has budget so it looking good
doesn't count i'm saying it doesn't count of course it counts the visuals is what makes you
able to see a film yes visuals are a part of the film it's just like of course yes it does look
very good i'd rather focus on something more you know substantive i've come out recently that have
had huge budgets and have not looked good then you cannot come out and say that the last jedi
looking good just comes down to money and it shouldn't be counted as a positive i'm not saying
it shouldn't be counted as a positive yeah he's not saying that the fact is uh you know i can cite
the amount of money that's gone into my videos if i wanted to so if there are things in the video
that cost me to buy to be able to put them in or uh different art that rags has had commissioned
he could be like this is how much money it costs me to we can actually quantify it uh yes you know
these things exist yet they are positives in our videos of course rags puts them there because
people like to see them it's not because they're worthless rags never said it was just it's the
only way they can counter argue is to just invent the shit you say i know jesus like can't we talk
about like the the movie instead of the silly things like yes the visuals are part of the movie
i mean something that's more you know interesting instead of yeah it looks good yet everyone agrees
basically that it looks really good yeah they spent a lot of money to make it look good and
the people who did their jobs did them very well and they had ample time to do it yes but
that's not really any of the issues that anyone has with the film is how it looks you know yeah
there are a couple people who think it doesn't look too good i i typically i like the look of
the film but again that didn't save the film at all like i h e then says hello ren is probably
the most interesting is this picking my video um that's all this is the thing throughout the
the theme of this video is the complete lack of self-awareness from tiaro every argument you
makes in favor of i had everything can be applied to you where he's like you misunderstand the
context in which he is saying this or remember those words we came up with he was like you don't
understand he's being hyperbolic he's being sentimental he's being both sarcastic he'd be
like these all apply to rags so yeah didn't have for tenga did say this was a good response
and this response is really shit yeah i mean so i'm not impressed i'm really unimpressed i i kind
of went into this thinking hey maybe he'll you know really say something but oh this isn't good
at all i don't say that the last jedi looking good just comes down to money and it shouldn't
be counted as a positive and that's stupid i h e then says hello ren is probably the most
interesting character in this entire franchise now rags doesn't dispute that but asserts that
he's the only interesting character then there's this back and forth which isn't really my
you know i i'm inclined to agree with you kylo red's the only person that i'm interested in
is because i have no idea what the hell's going on with kylo red yeah that's the thing man is
like in kylo there's you know fundamental flaws with his arc there especially at the end of the
throne room and all that but i mean it's something i mean again our bar is really low for characters
in the last jedi but of all of them kylo is the one that they can do the most with i think
and yeah you know like what do you want us to say it's like no i'm not interested in seeing
where rose goes where finn goes where ray goes where who else is that poe i don't understand
like i don't give a shit none of them like kylo's interesting just because he actually like is
powerful takes actions to get to where he wants and i don't know what he wants so i'm just saying
let's think like allegedly he's powerful yeah we haven't actually seen him do anything powerful
to my knowledge yeah he held a shot in uh in mid-air he stopped uh he stopped a blaster bolt
and the force awakens and he lost lightsaber fights a few times he lost a ray twice that's
yeah that's evidence of his power oh wait to dictate i'm not here to dispute the opinions
themselves too much though i will obviously state them ranks expresses that he feels that
the military and strategic incompetence of the first order actually gave me no sense of tension
like i had in the original trilogy i never felt afraid for our characters i never felt afraid for
ray because she's a mary sue and she she'll excel and surpass anything that should be expected of
a character like her in every scenario which is fine he then states that although the i agree
which is fine oh i'm thank yeah it is fine fights were visually appealing that disney has money then
we discuss cinematography once more and rags does agree that the cinematography was good he just
asserts that ryan johnson needs to stay away from everything else yes everything explains why he
loved the music score and clearly feels very passionately about it as someone who is a big
fan of scores myself i can definitely relate however rags his only comment is that i don't
remember any of the music from this film that's all i actually then praises the what's wrong with
that yeah i don't remember the music what's rags gonna say like no i hate everything you don't like
the score in the film it's like here's the thing this is the thing i noticed it's okay to say that
you don't remember or that you don't know it's like the way that was framed was as if you'd
you'd fallen short there it's like what else can rags do yeah it's like i don't i didn't remember
any of it and here's the thing everybody walked out of the lord of the ranks trilogy knowing the
music man or the original star wars knowing the music is like there's a lot of there's a lot of
musical scores out there that really stick with you i think the scores in the the prequels are
better than the sequels uh a lot of people cite the revenge of the sith has like one of the best
star wars tracks or soundtracks in uh uh the the saga so you know the sequel ones all i remember
from the sequels is i remember ray's theme but again that's more force awakens and that's probably
because i've seen the film so many times now as opposed to remembering it first time around
if you asked me to hum a song from the sequel or from the current trilogy i i couldn't i honestly
couldn't yep i just don't they just didn't they don't stick with me they just haven't stuck with
me visual effects which rank uses the disney and if you like the music that's okay yeah that's if
you like the music that is totally fine i have no problems with it it's just not my thing just
didn't stick with me but if you like it man more power to you and i'm glad that you liked it
again money does not guarantee good vigils you only have to look at some of the criticism black
panther and equally budget blockbuster received for its cg so that money in film doesn't always
this is the thing he's assuming that we're saying if you have a budget your cgi will be good
it's no it's if you have a budget spent on cgi with the contracts allowing the companies to
have the time they require then it will be good yes obviously it's not because me do you think
me and rags aren't aware that you could spend a million on a movie and put ten dollars into the
cgi budget like that could happen so obviously the statement that money equals good cgi isn't
completely valid you need a bit more nuance let me take a look but we're using it as a general
statement okay um black panther is amazing so why are cg models so terrible from ingadget well no
black panther is really mediocre and the cg models are similar but yeah like there's articles and
stuff talking about it you know and i'm curious if a lot of them have you know talk about where
did the cost go can you talk about a different movie next time have we even talked about star
wars really in this entire video we haven't even this is this is the closest thing that we've got
to talking about the cgi that's the thing or talking about the movie like this is it
like we're just now kind of starting to talk about the film
actual quality is not assumed not from my perspective at least but really this outlines
a fundamental difference although rags is attempting to excuse what i h e likes he's
not using it it's fine if he does excuse what he likes what does that even use i hate that's
terrible wording as if his opinion is like an affront to me or something like he's like i'm
not excusing his opinion i'm either saying that i agree or that it's fine it's like it's it's fine
it's totally fine to have whatever opinion you want i'm not excusing it i'm curious what he
exactly he means by that why would it's almost like he's implying that i hate everything needs
an excuse you know it's when and you say shit like this and people in the comments eat it up
so he's excusing his opinion he's like you're assuming like i have this mental outlook on
somebody else's you know i'm like on this guy's opinion is like if you like the score of the last
jedi that's fine music is like at the top end of the most subjective thing i could ever imagine
yeah i mean i'm not a musician so you're not going to catch me being able to say anything
about the construction if i find something boring i'll tell you that's about it excuse
did they crop your dog go off the white background that's just strange yeah that's
that's one of it's it's a little side thing but yeah they did um which why bother because
not only that but this is the first time it's been done because of the different editors so again
it's just like uh it's a bit it's just so confusing attempting to excuse what i actually
like he's not really arguing as if it was like as if he thinks that it actually like offends me
that he liked the music yeah i was going to say i'm trying to absorb this point entirely quality
is not assumed not from my perspective at least but really this outlines a fundamental difference
although rags is attempting to excuse what i actually like he's not really arguing that much
and this just shows that people have different ideas of what they expect cinema to be and have
different areas of interest of what composes a good film and what may make one person happy won't
necessarily make another even if it's the same content yeah yeah yeah i don't believe i have
ever disputed that you can break down so many things but it's like the way that he's explaining
this he's clearly like framing it like that's not my position like someone in the comments was
pointing out earlier that tro is trying like his damned hardest to make me look a certain way
or explaining these basic concepts as if you don't sort of adopt them
that may not work for you but it doesn't necessarily contradict what may work for someone
else i actually then says enjoy the themes of learning through failure even if some characters
are thrown to the side for the sake of reinforcing that point rags take this point and suggest that
luke skywalker shouldn't have been one of them and as well as i have for a act bar then there's
the mark hamil thing again an itm rags clip god what is the structure of this video like
he says this point then rags at this point and then they talk about this it's like what
are we gonna talk about them or it was are you saying that what rags said was okay i don't know
it's it feels like he paid a bunch of people to edit this who are different people and not him
you know and that there wasn't a lot of i feel as if there wasn't a lot of cohesive
you know communication this is strangely structured video it is a little hard to follow
where we're going i was like oh shit where are we going now sort of thing and by the way uh
nice to see the themes have been brought up yeah the themes themes i clapped for themes
please disagree on this point rags can't be emotionally invested and that's fair enough
it's his opinion i h e makes it nice towards a certain character that some have called pointless
i think the way the film culminates with the three different plot lines all coming together
is extremely well you say you say yeah i'd say convenient i know i i remember listening to him
say that he's like it's so amazing how they converge it's like what do you mean the scripture
said they all meet here do you remember rose crashes in with fin as the only ship that could
even make it into the to the good guys and they just that just worked out that way like what about
that is so amazing to you in terms of writing it was like it's very very lazy really was yeah
like and then they then they crash there and then ray shows up well yeah the three plumbers
how does ray get this like well she has a fight with kylo that he just gets knocked out by and
she takes the in the throne room yeah and she takes a support ship and like no one stops her
there's no issue she just oh yeah i'm just gonna take you know we're just here now they have a
throwaway line him falcon he's like oh she took uh snokes emergency vehicle vessel and you're like
oh oh that's just accessible for anybody i guess and she just turns up in the this is what i mean
it's like if if you really want to say that it's amazing how they all come together it's like if
we look at it deeply it's like good god it's bad they just shove everyone together and she took
snokes craft and arrived in the millennium falcon it's like a craft we didn't know existed and we
don't know why she didn't get knocked out by him we don't know why there was no alerts to this room
to send anybody in to deal with whatever happened why do you there's just so much it's just like i
guess that's just how that worked fine sure that's really well written and fin drag shrek back to the
base before they already yeah it's just like they're all just there they're all just there
wherever you need them to be they're just there and yeah like the the obvious question of did she
just walk up to snoke's personal ship and it just allowed her to leave there was no security there's
yeah you think yeah it's like jeez oh and that's fair enough it's his opinion i h e makes a nudge
towards a certain character that some have called pointless i think the way the film culminates with
the three different plot lines all coming together at once is extremely well executed and genuinely
thrilling and exciting even if what it took to get there had some bumpy moments rags embellishes
it's almost as if you understand there are extremely legitimate criticisms people have
of this film and that's the thing he completely does his previous points were not to suggest
yeah but there's been no impression of that throughout this whole video so far
yeah it's like he suggests that there's actual criticism unless i'm like oh that's not mince
weirds here he said on his fucking sardonic ass podcast that he's not really heard any good
arguments against the film yeah i h e really really flip-flops around uh when it comes to
the last jedi so he's selectively aware of good arguments he's selectively like it's like it's
almost as if depending on present company he'll say different things which is kind of slimy
and this is the thing at tro is like see he obviously understands there's good arguments
it's like who i don't know i haven't gotten that impression not just from his videos but what he
actually says that there weren't he just felt that there are too many points of worthlessness
or toxicity as well there was no denial of legitimate criticisms just an observation that
maybe some criticisms are a bit unnecessary for a film that's ingrained in the star wars
who the fuck's gonna argue unnecessary what do you mean what do you mean unnecessary criticism
well like the willhelm one is probably unnecessary but i wouldn't even unnecessary is a strange way
to label it i don't know yeah like it isn't needed like i'm assuming that's even a real
assuming that's even a real thing yeah i'm surprised you didn't go with like instead of
like a joke comment that he's taken seriously i i i think he probably meant to say something
like hyperbolic because unnecessary seems very strange yeah it's very strange movies and regardless
of what you think about the last jedi there's nothing inherently unfair about that
it states that he personally thought mark hamill's art was very satisfying and although i never
personally agreed with the jolting introduction i can understand that from the premise what followed
wasn't unreasonable to viewers rags responds to this suggesting he could play more mark hamill
footage which doesn't really change the point what mark camel thought doesn't necessarily
change the validity of what someone else thought so this part i don't think rags would have said
that uh well it depends if if if i hit everything was like this is completely in line with mark
hamill's character it's like well i could play more clips from mark hamill to let you know that
the guy who plays the character thinks the complete opposite but hey you know there's obviously a
discussion to be had there but i guess if he was like but that's how i feel he'd be like oh all right
part is pretty important i think i hate everything says that he didn't really have a problem with
how the force was used in the last jedi and that he didn't agree with how a lot of the fans have
said that it wasn't done right and rags interprets this as a personal attack on the fans didn't have
a problem with the way the force was used like a lot of fans do yeah those pesky fans which no
dude he's just disagreeing with them rags is clearly being hyperbolic so you don't need to
you don't need to interpret it so wrongly quinton see again the self-awareness is just completely
out the window none doesn't exist rags literally said those pesky fads it's like what do you think
rags if rags had said i had everything i don't appreciate the insults i think the fans are pesky
like really it's just sad it's like uh let's say that rags has given no benefit of the doubt while
giving no benefit of the doubt to rags how do you not realize what you're doing calm down
rags son begins to lay down yeah it is your opinion it's just my idea why can't you just
let people have opinions quinton gosh quinton's so bigoted i didn't have a problem with the way the
force was used like a lot of fans do yeah those pesky fans which no dude he's just disagreeing
right because every time the fan mentions so he told you to calm down by the way after calling
us home warriors like i'm going off the chain or something like quinton all he's done is disagree
well you've been like mauler and rags are a blight on film criticism they're toxic they think
that no one should have an opinion they fight their war every day it's like dude so we're the
ones who need to calm down turn off those pesky fans i didn't have a problem
i feel that's what ryan johnson did just turn i'm sure that's uh that's gotta be like a plaque
at disney hq right now turn off those pesky fans force was used like a lot of fans do yeah those
pesky fans which no dude he's just disagreeing with them calm down rag son begins to lay down
this idea that the last jedi is bad because it quote fucks up the lore no it's bad because they
spent money on cgi yeah no money get your fucking arguments straight get your get your wrong
argument astray i love that he says this as well like fucks up the law and it's like you realize
that i hate everything i said the prequels are fucked up the laws it's not like a hyperbolic
statement it's something that is actually you can you can actually measure you know rules that
contradict each other and it's like try and what are you gonna do argue that yoda's force lightning
totally makes sense and that doesn't counter anything yep totally works makes sense yeah
that's chat yeah it's funny how being hyperbolic it's so convenient for rags but when ihg is being
hyperbolic you don't see it like yeah funny how that works out now first of all i think
most people would find it entirely reasonable to debate if the lore is even okay quinton where is
your debate with mauler that's not gonna happen where where is the debate that you refuse with
mauler that the last jedi is bad because it quote fucks up the lore now first of all i think most
people would find it entirely reasonable to debate if the lore is even important to if the movie is
good or not jesus christ what do you mean really did you unironically say that you stupid tub it's
like why do you think they have law in the films because it doesn't do anything and it doesn't
matter so come on i don't care if most people would even think that they're wrong i just i just
wonder how far this goes it's like some people would debate whether or not characters are even
important to a film's quality like just continuity non-important consistency in universe rules is
like why have what what's the fucking point of even having what's the argument what's the argument
for how law doesn't matter i want to hear that what it's literally where we derive our rules
and history from for the universe like how do you not have the law there's law in everything
pretty much any fiction it's like how does it how does a critic of of like films unironically say
that you know like the opening to lord the rings where they're like they were the great rings were
forged people just like get on with it no one cares about the law like oh but this is important
because the one ring is is literally the the entire point the film's like i don't care about
the law get on with the jewelry okay i ain't a woman but let's just try to ignore this for now
because rags doesn't even really prove that the movie does fuck up the lore his key example for
this is the sequence where yoda shows up at the end of the film as a force ghost he doesn't prove
it that he proves it like this is the lightning it's the lightning yeah i'm assuming he's gonna
get to that mauler and rag is both bring up three main points about this the first being
that yoda should have appeared earlier in the movie and indeed during the events of the flashbacks
yeah yo yoda is supposed to be he has a standard investment in the the jedi succeeding and good
winning over evil so where the fuck was he when everything was falling apart it's like one of
those things where if yoda cared then you'd think he would show up before now yeah so that's that's
that's the easy contradiction yoda decides to show up now he's like why hasn't he shown up before
it's like oh well because luke uh it's like luke's been a fucking depressed idiot for like what
10 years or something like he's been there for a while in 20 30 years who knows and then ray shows
up and luke look why now and this isn't even even talked about the stupid fucking lightning
right naughty forget the lightning why now was this like a great moment of peril for luke or
something like that and yoda just does what luke would have done anyway it you know strange decision
when luke fucks up with kylo and then decides you know what i'm gonna go and find that planet and
just sit in exile that's around about the time i think yoda should pop in and be like hey maybe
that's not a great idea well he was in his x-wing flying to the planet you think loda would be on
the dashboard like are you sure you want to do this but no luke i don't know about this dude
like this seems like a bad idea and then you get the ghosts of you know add a kid popping up and
the ghost of obi-wan being like hey luke i know i haven't seen you in ages but like this is a bad
idea before doesn't matter jesus christ yoda who conveniently has showed up 30 years after luke
has decided to crash himself here gee thanks a lot yoda thanks for waiting 30 years this also
raises the question of where has yoda been while luke has been spiraling into this new and interesting
character over 30 years especially if it took one sentence to bring him back from his perspective
where was yoda when kylo was created where were any of the force ghosts the answer is that for one
luke spends most of the movie cut off from the force yeah no he wasn't cut off he wasn't cut
off all the whole time and that's not even yeah it's not like that's a rule that you can't get
a visit from a force ghost if you are cut off from the force it doesn't stop yoda from walking
wherever he wants to yeah i mean and even even if we gave him the benefit of the down
there's still all the time that he wasn't like what it's it's it's just as ridiculous this isn't
something you can argue so i'm interested to see what else he's got because that's that's his first
point it's already out the window and for two this is explained in episode five if you choose to face
you will do it alone what obi-wan comes back after that
yeah what are you talking about quinnson
all right let's see if there's more to this point i cannot interfere
now you can try and speculate that's it that's all you got oh we can speculate what that's what
we're doing obi-wan comes back he celebrates with anakin and yoda that's a thing that happens
so sorry quinton sorry to you from the force and for two this is explained in episode five
if you choose to face vader you will do it alone i cannot interfere now you can try and
speculate over why they couldn't appear in this one sequence but none of that's ever really
clarified it's just no explanation and then it and then what yoda does counters it anyway
they can interfere besides uh if someone was to try and say you see him saying i can't interfere
means yoda cannot strike lightning it's like why the fuck can yoda strike lightning on a very
a place that's very real he sets it on fire and explodes it he can clearly interfere with matter
like he can do a thing that's destructive and to be like oh well he can do that but he can't do it
to the first order he'd be like oh that's just bullshit he has like the problem that i point out
about lore consistency quinton why would you play lore inconsistency to combat my point of
lore inconsistency are do you have no self-awareness but even if we allowed that point if we said yeah
you're right he does say you can't interfere that doesn't explain the the question we actually
raised which was where's yoda been this whole time we're not asking that's because it's another
point that yoda should have been electrocuting the enemies where's he been that doesn't answer
where he's been bad this is really bad relation so all we really know is that in this situation
they couldn't appear now if you want to try and argue that no we don't know that at all it's
never said and even if it was they'll be awful if they just if luke had when luke sees him in
episode uh well the last jedi he's like yoda where have you been and he goes i haven't been
able to come to you this whole time and that's it and as video gamer seven pointed out the lore
doesn't matter also this statement from a previous movie explains this it's like see you in while
there's no self-awareness from quinton it's this is this is baffling he's how he
it's the theme of the video back to back this isn't a good enough explanation that's entirely
you're right but if you're arguing it specifically in the context of episode eight that's strange
yeah it's strange because it makes sense and that's just like ed that's kryptonite to you
oh god yeah he hates that shit to me yeah because to me if this is good enough for episode five
then it should be good enough for the entire you haven't made an argument for why it's good for
episode five but not what ob one said was i've always interpreted it as he was like if you go
and fight vader i'm not going to help you because uh you're a piece of shit like you're ignoring my
advice to stay away from him he's trying to tempt him away from it and by help obviously he's
probably i i would say it's it's very likely he's referring to the same help he gave him in
episode four where he was like let go luke use those you know he's in his head giving him advice
he's not fucking firing lightning bolts of people it's strange too that when he says i cannot
interfere that doesn't he's not saying that the rules of the force dictate i can't interfere
he's saying i can't interfere and it could be for personal reasons um what quinn's i had
advocating for here is like if we just think about you know how it's probably not possible
and invent reasons for that it totally makes sense what a strange person to be a critic
franchise i don't know why we would be cherry picking this one situation yeah we're not before
we go any further i want to point out something inherently contradictory in the opening minutes
of his video rags directly attacks i hate everything for having an attachment to star wars
looks to me like you've got quite an emotional attachment to star wars which i had everything
confirmed in our conversation he said that yes i am i'm correct he's correct on that i'm i'm
correct i'm just i'm just right i just hope i never irrationally attach myself to something
like you've done to star wars what's pathetic and what's childish is you having emotionally
attached yourself to a brand but throughout his own video he discusses why he views the
movie to be bad through the lens of someone who is upset that their attachment to the characters
the universe and the story has been disconnected no that's not a no that's not a contradiction
why did he why did he found such a rhymed about way of saying that he was like your rags are
looking at it through the lens of someone who is disconnect is he trying to say that you're doing
what i had everything's doing in reverse like you your argument stemmed from someone who hates it
is like here's the thing like i can appreciate like terminator 2 right like i'm not like a huge
terminator fan or anything but i can defend it through the lens of somebody who loves it
also yeah uh nicolas funnily enough nicolas quinton in chat just highlighted uh quinton
brought up that part with ob one to explain that ghosts can't interfere uh when they do
interfere in episode four and the like i said we we brought that up and like i said i believe
that ob one said he will he can't interfere because he's trying to tempt luke away from
going after vader in episode five he's very clear about that he says stop it's just very
strange now who's not paying attention to the law that isn't relevant apparently
so confusing ryan johnson laughs at your concept of being attached to characters and it shows a
direct disdain for the established lore of the star wars universe that many people respect
not to mention the complete disrespect to the lore and invention of series altering mechanics
i don't even know if i'd consider myself a star wars fan anymore this this may have killed it for
me why does he should i care does he conflate being a fan of something to having like a deep
emotional attachment to something yeah i think he's taken what you've said and uh skewed it so
you're you're you're arguing that an emotional attachment is making it unable to see what's
actually happening and he's like you see your emotional detachment is making you unable to see
what's happening it's like no you're saying that your emotional detachment is caused by what
happened very strange like i'm i'm a fan of like mass effect right but i hate andromeda
i mean i'm a huge fan of the predator franchise that it keeps getting shattered over and over
again it's like and i and i don't understand is there like a point where i'm trying to make an
argument from emotion yeah no that's the thing you haven't as far as i can tell but again we don't
really see much of your video in any kind of coherent manner for all i know this is the opening
second or the last second i i've got no clue very strange air anymore people who want to see luke
being a badass like he was in the original trilogy he earned his badassery if you think
that alex's opinion is invalid because he's just a star wars fan no a fan boy's its own thing a fan
boy is its own thing entirely it was very clear he said he was so emotionally attached he's unable
to actually like think critically it's a very simple concept stop trying to like desperately
try and twist it so it makes the rags of hypocrite like that's not gonna work we could we know what
he said we're moving right along this is another thing quinton does he loves to reframe like uh
take very small quotes and then reframe it and like take the original context away and put his
own on it so it could be like look how bad this is guys and it clearly worked when we looked at those
comments uh people hate rags thanks to this video or or they came just to do so the same thing that
just simply aren't true who are attributing to me things that i've never said or that you are hating
you for things that you've never said and it's because people like this will say that and it
just gets believed and spread you know yeah to then turn around and say that because you used
to be a star wars fucking music by the way i know i was about to say why is there music why do you
wear a blue shirt in front of a blue ring why this fan boy and you once had an attachment to the
franchise your opinion is better than his yeah rags never said that either just keep going quinton
keep spewing nonsense man keep trying keep one day you'll make a point like maybe keep on digging
for a reason that just seems mean-spirited and hypocritical good god do not comment on people
being mean-spirited and hypocritical dude yeah yeah quinton you're pretty low tier in that regard
by the way at this point i'm arguing as a fan and not as a critic and i think that says a lot i
don't even know what that means really like your statement is your statement is it accurate either
way yeah like why why are those different things why is that distinction even one that needs to be
made i'm arguing as a fan and not a if anything saying that you're arguing as a fan and not a
critic is bad because you're putting away your you know you're scrutinizing lens it's giving
things a pass rags then goes on to say that the last jedi adds information about the force ghosts
and thus it's bad he starts i don't think rags would have said it adds information is contradictory
information i would imagine is what you're going for off with the fact that luke gets hit on the
head by yoda's cane yes and this means the force ghosts can touch things and thus it's a retcon well
except for the fact that force ghosts are he's gonna reference that he sat on a log as opposed
to actually hitting somebody log he's not doing anything with though he's just sitting down yeah
for all we know he's not actually actually touching the log at all yes it's just a representation of
him like the log is no this is terrible quinton this is like he's god he hits the guy with a stick
is not look reacts to it like ow what the fuck you're like you just hit me yes we don't know
anything about the log it was probably just the actor the ghost itself no there's no reason for
the ghost itself to have in any way needed to do that but he could have just in terms of wanting
to show that he was resting there we we don't know we don't know if there's any effect on the log
at all and besides you brought it up luke's yoda summoned lightning that's a bit of a jump compared
to either of the ones we've just got over yes he he disappears and reappears he doesn't have to
manipulate the log in order to sit on it that's a thing they're constantly sitting on things
constantly sitting on things like two instances leaning on things making noises while they walk
through grass oh good god finger and editing thing yeah that's easily uh you could easily
chalk that up to a movie era while luke getting hit by yoda is a deliberate choice yeah man it's
like the it's like the the car and the shire man it's like you know if it was made today that's
an editing thing that's not an in-universe thing that's an editing thing yeah if it was made today
there's a good chance that they would have him phase through all the grass because he's a ghost
for fuck's sake and besides yeah it's like it's like you're judging alec guinness for having a
sit down he's an old man like jesus so that point is immediately developed he just sat down in that
scene because he had to poop i love how he said that point is immediately debugged you could
basically just play that back to him every single time he makes a point
it brings up the fact that yoda as a force ghost can now use lightning and this fucks up the lore
i trust you don't have to think long about how much this fucks up the lore yes does it though
you're an idiot quinton holy fuck it's like a child should be able to grasp that all of a sudden
you introduce the fact that force ghosts can use lightning on real objects and destroy them
it doesn't for one in what situation have we seen the force ghosts in before where they
you haven't that's the point exactly uh that's the point quinton is that they weren't doing that
but they could have at any time they wanted yeah we've been told no so it's like the the
force ghosts were not on end or when our team were trying to destroy the shield generator because
we assumed there's nothing they could do anyway but now the last jedi has confirmed that not only
can they definitely do something but they they can go as far as actually hit people in the face so
you'd be like okay well that doesn't matter because the force ghosts don't have the motivation
for it right and it's like well no if you take anything said by obi-wan and the originals he's
as a force ghost he's basically trying to find any way shape or form to defeat the emperor and
basically win so of course they have the motivation they have the ability to actually do something
why wasn't yoda firing lightning at the fucking shield generator base in uh empire
return of the jedi and here's here's the thing too in the original trilogy especially it wasn't
ever really made entirely clear whether or not the force ghosts were just apparitions unique to
the person yeah or if they were like group things or if the force ghosts were actually there or
it wasn't really clearly defined right but they all kind of existed in that sort of essence right
now we've established that they can appear as physical manifest manifestations right and they
can affect things they can hit you with sticks and they can cast lightning at this point it makes you
wonder why bother being alive and this is the thing he had a very real effect on a very real
structure on a real planet this was not something that was just like you saw obi-wan walk through
an area you know it's a bit different very simple i don't know why that uh he's he's having trouble
with this but then again it is quinton so two people they can't appear during confrontation
this is essentially the first time they can appear during confrontation we the obi-wan was
with luke when he destroyed the death star with darth vader so obviously they could fucking get
around where it would have made sense for them to do this ever for two force ghosts are constantly
said to be part of the living force every time a character dies in the star wars universe someone
says some shit like one with the force they are now it is not insane to me or an inherent
contradiction that force ghosts part of the actual force could make a bolt of lightning come down
but okay why haven't they done that before yeah the thing is that they do they did that's what
happened and now we know that that's a thing they could do so yeah it's i think quinton thinks that
we're saying we can't believe that that they did that we believe they can do that and we accept
they can do that and that's the problem yeah it's i don't know i love how he's like it's not a
contradiction to me it's like i don't care it's a contradiction like i don't know i don't care how
you interpret it we're talking about the actual things that happen but why is this so hard for you
he was with him when he fled the death star too run luke run yeah um man
earlier in the video i hate everything made a pretty good case for why he didn't agree with
these very points but rags was playing so little of the video at once that he failed to understand
what Alex was trying to say so yeah we the rags would be we failed to understand i hate everything
but you you you you get us 100 it's not like you have to not only ignore everything we say but you
have to invent quotes from us he's such a hypocrite like i don't even know where in my video we are
no of course i have no idea what he's referring to as well i i'm i think it would be
unlikely we're going to get a clip but let's hope someone so i will now try and explain
bum luck in the in the chat asks an interesting question if that's how the force ghosts work then
why aren't there thousands of dead jedi constantly intervening in conflict
this is thousands of them like right here it's just and then they kill you and then you become
a force ghost this is why you if i was to write star wars i would have basically said yeah force
ghosts are uh specific to the person and um we don't actually know if they really can affect
anything at all we'll we'll never find out because i'll never confirm that as a writer
but ryan johnson decided to go the other way with that also um there's someone picked it up i am
actually a little bit ill i've got a bit of a cold hopefully it's not ruining my uh my audio quality
i didn't notice i didn't notice someone picked up that i'm congested so very good ears apparently
most of the complaints about the force and the canon in episode 8 comes down to a sentiment along
the lines of if it didn't happen in episodes one through six no uh it's about presenting scenarios
in which these abilities would have helped people uh they were not used simple as real quick because
i think i know what he's gonna say and it can't happen now i yeah he said exactly what i thought
he'd say we're not saying this see this is a problem with quinton he attacks a completely
separate point than the one we're making it it just he just latches onto something he invents
in his head and he goes for it and he completely ignores what we're saying we our problem is not
that it can't happen our problem is that it can if um you know the four skype calls that are
apparently a very very like you have to be an extremely powerful sith slash jedi to be able to
pull those off to me i'm like well a sith's jedi skype call doesn't really change anything
in the in the other films the ability to do that doesn't really do anything to them so it's fine
with me like uh that's how you would add a force power you don't add a force power that says um
if you cast this force power you're immune to damage that's a new thing you can do now and
it's like why didn't they do that in all of those fucking other films you have to be careful about
what you add because what you add can contradict what came before and that's just about respecting
the fucking writing that's i don't know why i have to explain this but this is it's very like
i said before it's very strange that this is coming from someone who considers themselves
stars yeah yeah it's very strange this is the kind of this is the last kind of person i would
want offering any any kind of criticism an entirely unreasonable standard what force powers existed
in episode four the answer is obi-wan doing the thing about force powers he's going on a tangent
now he's going on a tangent about something that we've never even addressed he's going to explain
that force powers are introduced in episode five that we're not in episode four therefore the last
jedi makes sense it's like that's not that's not a point quinton it's not gonna make sense but we'll
let you we'll let you do it just to get past it these aren't the droids you're looking for
mind trick thing and darth vader choking someone from a distance the film shows a confrontation
between the two mightiest force users in the galaxy and both of them use zero force powers
in the battle it's fine and the force in practice is rarely demonstrated in the film itself over
the years since episode i was like oh yeah well um uh let's see endor wasn't in episode four
so that means that people must have a problem with it yeah uh they never mention endor in episode
four so it existing in episode six must mean that rags and mauler have a problem with that
i mean yeah by this logic right quinton like he's he's like who is he arguing against
he thinks he's arguing against a point we've made let's say a man made of strawberries like
no it's a man made of like jelly he's like he's he's alone in his room arguing against a point
that no human being has made that's relevant here in this scenario it's it's very strange
like he's literally the only person involved with this at this point no i i told you man like he's
he always wanted to respond to my videos so he just he ranted in his room and he sent this video
in to the editors for i hit every tro and they've just supposed it onto the this video it's just
there now it's just been repurposed into sections and just been plopped on and he can feel satisfied
he's like see i counted mauler even though he's used as like uh this is why the last
Jedi is bad sort of thing even though his video is stupid and this is how and it's like you've
done such a piss-poor job of countering me and rags
and he keeps using law arguments when he said the law isn't important
for numerous force powers have been a retconned into existence no that's not a retcon
retcon into no it's not how that word works if you know because you'd be like
oh fucking Boba Fett was retconned into existence because he wasn't in episode four it's like
that's not how that works yes retcon is a piece of new information that imposes a different
interpretation on previously described events typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift
or account for an inconsistency with Vader strangling that officer we know that he can
basically have some form of telekinesis so when Luke uses telekinesis to grab his lightsaber in
episode five we can reasonably assume that was always possible for Vader too also for those of
you don't know retcon means retroactive continuity food levitating or pulling something without
physical touch yes strangling somebody would be the equivalent of doing that you're using a
something at distance telekinesis and again what does that contradict in the fourth film nothing
the force to jump higher what does what is jumping high with the force contradict
in the fourth film nothing using the force to summon what does using electric on somebody with
the force lightning contradict in either episodes four or five nothing lightning to your fingertips
using the force to talk to someone from a distance away that one that one's actually a contentious
one for a couple of people i can't remember what the problem with it is i think it's like um
um something like vader should have sensed luke faster than he did uh if this connection
is possible but it's like a ongoing discussion but again um that's actually a better example
he could have worked with that one instead of just naming powers and saying they didn't exist before
a fucking ghost and using the force to push things even by the time that episodes two and
three came out the force powers that existed within the star wars universe were still being
invented and expanded upon so what that means is that when you watch the films in any basic
chronological it's like he's implying that we just have a problem with new powers which is an
awesome yeah he legitimately is going after the argument that we've never made that we have an
issue with new things being introduced just because it's a new thing order they don't make
any sense because half of the force powers stop existing after rogue one i have to that's not a
no he just never there was never a scenario where vader needed to use any force powers other than
the ones he used simple as that his efficiency i would say adds to his you know his domineering
aspect yeah it's just like quinn's implying that because we didn't see uh force jump and force
lightning that they couldn't possibly exist in episode four it's like no
very silly as in his video rag says that luke and kylo not using force powers against each other
in their battle is a contradiction also i noticed the lack of force powers in that fight but that's
only true did you say it was a contradiction i don't know there's i can't remember because
i don't know i don't know if quinn added that or not because he adds a lot of shit to us you know
he played the clip he didn't say contradiction he said that it's uh i don't know there's no context
for what i'm saying i don't know what i'm saying and what response it is it's just a tiny little
segment of a thing and we always get the context of what things are said because we have to when
yeah we play the whole fucking video we got criticized for this but hey i way prefer it
to just pretending like we watched the video yeah i i don't know what i'm so i don't know what i'm
saying here in this video clip that he's playing i don't know the context of it this was remember
this is months and months ago i i can't remember it's off my head i wish he just played the whole
clip of me saying it yeah just just catch it though he says that you claim it's a contradiction
and then he plays a clip in which you don't even say that so it's interesting half of the force
powers stop existing after rogue one i have to bring this up because in his video rag says that
loupe and kylo not using force powers against each other in their battle is a contradiction
also i noticed the lack of force powers in that fight but that's only true under the standards
of the prequels yeah i i have no idea what i'm actually saying we need more context quinton
we don't even know what rag's point was i'm the one who said it and i don't even know what i'm
saying we'd have to how bizarre is that we'd have to go back to rags's video to figure out
what tro slash quinton is responding to instead of just telling us like like you play the clip
but it doesn't have the word contradiction in it so as far as we know all rags said
was that it's not even a clip yeah i don't know what to do with this it's like what you
i'm tempted to actually go and try and find it in your video but the thing is like your video is
far too long for me to figure out a lot of stuff and i have no idea if it's the first five minutes
if it's the opening half an hour or if it's the rest i have no idea where it is yeah i don't know
where we are i don't know where it is in my thing and so i guess this is why this is why the the
bullshit asymmetry is true by the way folks in chat you're like how long how does it take so
much longer to respond to something so much smaller we have to infer so much so let's let's
account for multiple arguments here the chat is saying that i was saying the fight was lame the
fight in the throne room was boring and the i was talking about the throne room fight
but the throne room fight doesn't have luke in it i know that's strange is he because i've got were
you actually talking about that is against the ray kylo and guards fight not the luke versus ben
fight let's just hear that again it's a contradiction also i noticed the lack of
force powers in that fight if rags is referring to the throne room fight this is a straight up like
malicious fucking move with editing yeah because i've got like one two three four like five people
saying that i was talking about the throne room and if you were talking about the throne room
fight is relevant because kylo nearly dies because he forgot he had the force
yeah but but quinton is framing this as if i'm talking about luke and ben fighting yeah
whoa if that this is this is kind of why i kind of want the context now so we can find out if he
is actually selling you short here that's um that's pretty fucking scummy if that's the case
i mean i'm assuming there's a couple of people who are trying to look for it i'm going to try
and look for it as well yeah i've got more people saying it's the throne room fight
um well that's the thing how could you possibly be mistake how could you possibly
accidentally play a clip of me saying something and then attribute it to just a completely
different thing well here's the thing like when you edit like the way that i edit i couldn't do
that and like i i physically wouldn't be able to do that and get away with it in my editing i guess
it's not my style but the style that i use because i refer to things as they occur i don't
just take random little clips from a mysterious part and the thing i'm responding to insert it
somewhere i'm not gonna be able to find it by skimming because there's no footage of the actual
fight because we did this before so we just need some if anyone can find a uh a timestamp
then jenna hard of course is that they didn't edit the video so yeah i mean ultimately it's
ultimately it's tro's fight it's fault because he approved it all and wait stony said rewind like
20 seconds and you'll understand let's just play this whole thing to make sure we're getting the
point here to sit within the star wars universe we're still being invented and expanded upon
so what that means is that when you watch the films in any basic chronological order they don't
make any sense because half of the force powers stop existing after rogue one i have to bring
this up because in his video rag says that luke and kylo not using force powers against each
other in their battle is a contradiction also i noticed the lack of force powers in that fight
but that's only true under the standards i was talking about the throne room scene i was i
remember i remember yeah when i was recording that because i don't use a script i just talked
out my ass and i remember that the the throne room fight i because there were no force powers
i yeah well i i do remember now all with all the stopping us from being definitive on this
is just getting that timestamp for you saying it because as soon as we find out that it's the truth
this is very bad for quinton um yeah i don't know let me see if i've i've probably got a file of it
here because this is the awkward thing is like uh i can't tell by scanning through your video
other than if we had a transcript of it because obviously there's no visual as well for the fight
because obviously it's only with trailer footage that he's got uh the film documents arena net
angry joe yeah i can arena net firing one day and that thoughts a lot of audio tracks let's
sort by size bully hunters steam free speech battlefield katake the downward thrust far cry
five response untitled me at net non-sec clip i i guess i don't have a it's so hilarious it's like
to be able to find out if this video is even accurate we have to rewatch your videos like
this you've totally failed at what the whole point of this video is
but i think i'm almost certain that indeed i was talking about the throne room scene
when i said there was a lack of yeah he's he's attributing my comments about a completely
different fight with completely different characters to another to us there's something
i didn't say that's um maybe you should rewatch bragg's video prior to this
well we shouldn't need to do that you shouldn't have to that's the point like
there was some kind of response if you have no idea what they're responding to
but i'm pretty sure that um yeah i mean again we'll just carry on and if anybody in chat
comes up with uh but i think he's completely taking me out of context here well again as
jenna said uh is it quinton doing that or is it quinton sent the editors the timestamp to put in
there so it is still his fault but it's also there it's like who the fuck knows and don't
worry arco uh my the last of my um new assets should be done today uh but so you'll get stuff
soon but i it's it's at this point i'm convinced that i'm being taken out of context i just don't
know who's responsible tiara is responsible but who's who on the first level is because it's like
technically it's tiara's video there's quinton's section in which he would have supplied the
specifics about the oh someone said they found it 110 34
wow we're new at the end of your video but we've still got like 50 minutes of this jeez we went
force powers in that fight also of course ray does better than kylo does because
hang on rags i can play this for you as well unless you're doing yourself in a nutshell
well the throne room encounter with yeah it's about the throne room 100
jesus fucking christ i'll just send you the url so you can have a look no i i know what i i said i
remembered but with the confirmation yeah that's i was talking about the third room scene rest in
peace quinton you've wow fucked up miserably now instead of it being a matter of you being
disingenuous and like putting words in our mouth through interpretation like extremely
crappy interpretation you've actually repurposed a clip you you've actually repurposed a clip
to mean something else so wow that's pretty fucking scummy let's just you know how long are
we into this stream now so people who will eventually watch this is an iron 48 where we
managed to actually confirm that uh quinton maliciously lied about rags to make him come
across saying something that he didn't it's like that that shit's inexcusable but hey
womp womp yeah we'll get over it but quinton it doesn't make you look very good mate
yeah it's like i'm i was like i'm not like harmed or anything over it i'm i'm disappointed
in my species i don't know he's a human sort of but it's like man that's low and people were saying
that this was a good video well they they would be the people who have no fact checking done
they'll just be like yeah make sense to me yeah man here lies quinton exposed exposition
and anyway someone saying what's the problem they're both talking about the fight in the
throne room luke wasn't in that fight yeah no quinton's not talking about that one and let's
see let's see how much he pushes on with this he might be thinking about the throne room uh
from the original trilogy i was talking about the throne room in last yeah there's there is no
fight that has kylo and luke other than the end of the film in which they don't use force powers
uh which is fair enough so let's see what point he makes with this because he's he's now lied
about what rag said but let's see what he extrapolates from it it's a contradiction also
i noticed the lack of force powers in that fight but that's only true under the standards of the
prequels because there are numerous lightsaber battles in the original trilogy that use no force
powers nothing you are using ace um yeah see so this is this is the issue is that uh he's selling
it as if you said that uh the fact that there's two people fighting they have to use force powers
when i'm assuming by the way uh the the the reason you went with the throne room fight is
because of the fact that the force would have saved kylo and he didn't use it yes it does
seem as if kylo just i guess forgot that he could use the force of course it does seem to be sort of
like a defining characteristic of his life but and he uses it remember in the force awakens he uses
it as a snap decision to save his life from the blaster bolt that's coming right for him
so uh it's a bit of a contradiction quinton but if you're talking about rags if you're referring
to the luke and kylo fight i guess i'd have to agree with quinton that yeah they didn't really
need to use the force in that fight and besides use a projection so what's he gonna do but it
looks like you weren't referring to that fight yeah i wow yeah luke and press f quinton did not
have a yeah i mean luke and kylo did not fight in a throne room as far as i know and besides
there's plenty of like a bathroom maybe if that's where the emperor goes to the bathroom it's sort
of a throne room there's plenty of fights in the ot that use force powers um he showed one where
luke uses force jump we have obviously the force lightning we have um the lightsaber throw from
vader at luke you could say that doesn't require the force but i mean the the the lore of the
movies imply that you need to be able to use telekinesis to aim the throw of the lightsaber
yeah and like someone in chat pointed out they do use the force in the kylo luke fight because
that's why luke is there yeah luke is using the force to be there so i suppose you could
argue that it's just like no yeah whatever standard for this film that has not been applied
to any other star wars movie but it's literally in all the star wars movies but sure maybe other
than episode four i'll give you that but again ob one versus vader like they didn't require force
powers just like they don't require throwing things or anything else like with with kylo i
don't see this is the thing it's almost implying that you made the point that luke and kylo should
be using the force on each other like throwing things and stuff but you you there's not even
remotely anything you said like that it's the big issue here before this now some of you are likely
going to argue that we do understand all these powers that we've seen them used in practice
and that they've been expanded upon in the lore but that's only true because in the past 40 years
these films have been worshipped and expanded upon when episode five came out no one knew what
that junk meant no one had explanations about i disagree people be able to use the force as uh
it's self-explanatory by what we see when luke like pulls his lightsaber we know that at maximum
a minimum he can do that sorry um yeah and and besides um i just i it's not that we need an
explanation as to how it necessarily functions as long as it's consistent with its yeah that's the
thing you can add new things and it can be consistent it just has to be consistent with
the old things that came before it metachlorians and and training it was just gobbledygook i was
just referencing the prequels not episode five but uh yeah so i don't know if you guys are catching
on to the argumentation here but he's saying that um it makes sense that it makes no sense in the last
jedi because it's never made any sense now when you're at that point in argumentation you're in
trouble like you you you're basically trying to say stop trying to understand it none of it makes
sense like but it does very clearly a bit awkward even luke and leah being siblings and leah being
able to use the force are things that were invented late into the production of episode six
so if you have to use that last minute episode six context to explain as long as it doesn't
contradict anything that's fine they could literally throw a scene on right at the end of
any star wars film where whereas someone does a thing with the force as long as it doesn't
contradict what we've seen before they they're they're happy to go ahead and do it that doesn't
bother me yeah i mean one thing i'll say is i'd be happier if they just repurpose the
powers we have to do different things to be more impressive in that way they don't need new powers
very very utility base too like telekinesis and pushing pulling i mean there's a lot of things
you could do with that also you just you just said like episode six adds on all those things
it was five that did that uh not six you like leah having a connection to the force and being able to
you know force city communicate and stuff like that's that's not something that was invented by
six universally agreeable and explained upon in the first place and again when i am criticizing
the previous star wars films for not having a consistency to a movie that he's using quotations
i don't know is to imply that like isn't it it is is aren't you criticizing him
i mean even if you don't think they're criticism they they actually are i think he just thinks it
helps to keep quoting everything as if it's not really really that thing yeah that's the thing
i mean now that we know the extent of his quotation capabilities i don't know that's a
smart move we have no idea what he means it's like when he puts up the quotes he means oh so
this is one of those fabricated quotes i understand came out in 1977 how wait a minute quit no
simply saying that those movies are bad i am simply applying the standard used on the last jedi
to the other films no you're not and if you were to do that you'd find all the contradictions
it's very simple we've been over this i'm sure you think that you do but um there is a uh there
is a wide divide but what you think and what actually is to prove a point oh and while we're
on this subject horse projection was in rebels so you can just hop off that i don't know anything
yeah rebels isn't the film so sorry i don't know and rebels is typically looked at very negatively
by fans from what i understand compared to the clone wars um but again yeah the trying to explain
the movies with something that happens in a cartoon show is like that's not really why in chat why
why is everyone putting wild why in the chat why you do this quinton i don't know
oh i guess i did i guess someone said why divide oh i i thought i said wide i guess yeah wide yeah
because wide ends with a d and divide starts with a d so it's like wide divide yeah that's that's
fair enough those are those are strange words to put together fucking high horse i g then
states that he thinks the force is a reasonable extension rags mistakes this is a comment about
luke so i can't really respond to a misunderstanding but it is an impressive rant so fair fair now this
is where we bring the voice point back rags calls out i h e okay this thing you're doing with the
voices you need to stop it makes you look like a fucking prick this would be fine if rags hadn't
done the exact same thing earlier no you might say well he was because i wasn't doing mine
disrespectfully i wasn't making my voice to make i h e look worse
well i mean and i got compliments on my i h e voice
yeah it's not the the aspect of putting a voice on it's like i didn't i had everything go like
really high pitched and nasally yeah oh yeah he does yeah it's clearly used as an insulting
yeah way but i wasn't being insulting to i h e at all i thought it was fairly decent impression
especially because i put the face on and everything yeah don't don't compare those
to making a voice is not yeah there's like one a lot of people in to do an impression of like a
woman in something they'll make their voice a little change a little bit it's not to insult
the woman it's just to show that somebody else is talking yeah talking out of what you're saying
is the difference between a mocking voice and a quoting voice essentially
yeah i mean i definitely wasn't doing it in a mocking voice i don't have a problem with i h e's
voice it's fine voice me as far as voices goes fine rant so fair play now this is where we bring
the voice point back rags calls out i h e okay this thing you're doing with the voices you need
to stop it makes you look like a fucking prick this would be fine if rags hadn't done the exact
same thing earlier and those who might say while he was doing it in response to i h e's voice in
the first place the first time around i h e did it was clearly a joke yeah i thought it clearly a
joke there you go rags oh so jokes can't be insulting okay nope jokes glad we've established
that even though jokes are funny oftentimes the the purpose of a joke is to insult but yeah doesn't
matter that is a joke that doesn't actually that's not a defense in fact i'd be like that's more
evidence to the fact that he's trying to insult people yeah i'm so tired of him saying like you
can't say that it's a joke sucker for fuck's sake yeah because my voice wasn't a joke because
i meant it in earnest i was just doing his voice because i was talking you know through him
and i want everyone involved to die horribly whether you find that funny or not its intent
was very clear unless we're in scotland you can't lock anyone up for that rags's i h e impression
was an extension onto that joke in which he attacked i h e's viewpoint no it wasn't an
extinction on the joke it was mine wasn't a joke you literally just put on a british accent didn't
you i put on an american accent all the time in my uh videos people don't usually assert it as you're
trying to make americans sound nasally or stupid it's like no i usually just go for a and here's
the thing i wasn't making a joke because i wasn't being insulting but let's say that we went with
what the right opinion thinks we're both making jokes i guess he's trying to point out that i'm
being hypocritical yeah i don't know but i'm not so that's weird forgive me if i find that rags does
not have the high ground to criticize i h e from at this point in time however rags follows this
with a passionate rant about how he's doing it because he's so angry at other opinions somebody
is when his editor basically takes a good 40 seconds and just has a picture of you scrolling
yeah i was i was actually kind of about to mention that too we're kind of on the same
wavelength from this one it's it's like it's again i'm more concerned with the substance of
the actual video but i find it interesting it's just like does that count as edits like do you
it's all you want because it's so inconsistent with the other stuff where it has like flashy
shit going on and your pictures flying across and it's just like this is just a pause of 30 seconds
with rags pictures like okay i would have thought they'd want to have tro's avatar on there at least
but um yes it's really that's what i would do the editing is just so like you have no idea what's
coming you know from at this point in time however rags follows this with a passionate
rant about how he's doing it because he's so angry at other opinions somebody on the internet
is criticizing something that you like and you can't stand that it makes you upset it makes your
blood boy you just i i could guess that much can't take it somebody doesn't like the thing
that you so they're obviously trying to say that uh you're doing the exact same thing you're accusing
him of you're unhappy that he likes the thing you're trying to do yeah the fade to gray and the
piano music in the back yeah really like and for whatever reason generally i don't edit the things
that i'm showing that other i know because now we we have no idea what of yours is actually there
and what is theirs like who knows say it's i don't know attached yourself to it emotionally
i mean if we're going off that logic i wasn't very dramatic i was just being assertive well
it's up to him if you're dramatic or not i remember he told you to calm down earlier
when you said like a really prosaic fucking statement so yeah i guess all the people would
fit the prerequisite for outrage it just seems like a dramatic piece to paint i h e the very mellow
relaxed person with an opinion of some raging s j w did i did you say that i think i only referred
to him as anita once because of a thing that he explicitly said because he did something
and i needed it once so i called him mockingly you need it well that means i don't think i i don't
think i h e's an s j w i don't know enough about him yeah like the the idea is like you know he's
just like a sort of highlighted is how like you're doing the same thing you're accusing i had
everything i was like well how are you not doing the same thing then t ro if we're gonna get that
broad with the definition how are we not doing the same thing to t ro this the same thing to
you that's the same thing to i had everything that's the same thing to the people who criticized
the last jedi just goes on and on it's just so strange when he he paints me having a
like i was just like this thing i just sit down in front of this microphone and i just talk
and generally past the words that i use there's not really anything that's really going on behind
it so if you have the fade to gray and you have the piano music playing and it's you know it's
originally my it's my audio playing over stuff that wasn't in my video it does paint you know
an impression that i don't think he's very yeah well literally do what he did to any statement
in any video and you could probably make it sound pretty dramatic oh yeah you can completely change
the context and the tone um and therefore the meaning behind what people do if you just leave
in their audio and add in some of your own and add some effects of your own well like if it
red and it started shaking it's like oh it's yeah that it becomes angry which he kind of did he
played like angry music and put i hate everything's face on a devil so that you know makes it look
like you're trying to say that he's there i i guess i he thinks i really hate i hate everything
but as i didn't really have anything personally against him that much i mean he made a shitty
video but you know no it's perfect but it was after your talk with him and how i h e went back
on all that at the flip of a hat and basically discarded all of it that's when i was like oh
that's kind of that's sort of that's a bit of a character thing right there hmm not that we
haven't had enough of that from this video alone specifically from quinton but hey i h e the very
mellow relaxed person with an opinion of some raging s j w it doesn't work not for me at least
there's not one moment that didn't exist that wasn't because it wouldn't work because that's
not what rags are sad but yeah it didn't work because that's not what i h e comes across as
the criticisms of star wars are seen as an attack on him it's just purposely provocative rhetoric
from rags then this is general it's purposely provocative rhetoric from i hate everything i'm
from you what you just did was purposely provocative with the music or without it yeah like don't even
go there there's no point problems and they're perfectly legitimate and not ones that we can
really break down when they're spoken about so generally but i actually felt differently these
points are both fair enough at this point i'm sick of the star wars brand argument leia and ray are
shown to be extremely powerful and established force users despite their blatant lack of training
on the subject it brings up questions and inconsistencies that deserve answers from
people who care about the universe and don't care about it just because it has the word star wars
slapped on the cover of it there's been no evidence to suggest that just because he is attached to
star wars as a concept somehow means he can't think about this film rationally yes it is
i'm pretty sure that was like someone you've brought up a few times because yes it is that's
why i played mauler's clip brand loyalty comes in multiple versions and forms and i believe that
when it comes to star war there's no reason that star wars does not have people who have that uh
brand loyalty attached to it you see it with consoles we see it with video games and if you
allow brand loyalty to taint your objective lens or your critical lens then you are ultimately
fooling yourself and you're not being honest with what criticism should be there's a ladybug in my
room and it keeps flying up to me and i just realized the ladybug is like don't make me kill
you you're like endangered as far as i know get out throw it out the window oh well i mean i just
want to continue i can't be able to do that right now as long as it doesn't bother me it's just
sitting over somewhere else in the room because i think they're kind of pretty it's just don't
fly in my eyes that's preferable for me oh yeah yeah personal space at general point of
irrational attachment to the brand was presupposed at the start where he called him a star wars
apologist and it's just been i mean i had everything has since agreed to this perspective
so okay so i he is by definition a star wars apologist this is not a point you can win the
right opinion yeah it's just like by definition i'm correct they he is an apologist they think
apologist means you defend it when you have no uh like argument two and you're just desperate
to do it emotionally yeah secondly the right opinion you yourself in this video prescribed
emotion to his defenses you're making emotional appeal he is making emotional appeals that you
have recognized yourself the right opinion add that in with the fact that he is by definition
a star wars apologist i would hope you can connect the dots remember he was like he's being uh
fuck it i keep forgetting the world that's the one yeah it's always sentimental yeah and how he
keep the defense is always that it's his opinion that this is how he feels about it this is all
it's just like it's very simple i wonder what he thinks apologist means it's all it's all feels
and opinions and that's how he feels that's how he feels that's how he feels and then when i say
yeah he's feeling too much he needs to do less he needs to do less feeling more thinking
all of a sudden yeah but you're not supposed to like mention it
shoehorned in throughout this video despite his numerous criticisms of the prequels
i actually then says there's obvious foreshadowing well apart from the very you can criticize
something love it yeah not only that but uh if you want regs to be specific i guess he's saying he's
an apologist for the sequels of star wars as opposed to the prequels of star wars yeah and
i'm only talking about this movie i'm talking about this movie the video he's talking about
is about this movie like do you think rags is saying that i hate everything is an apologist
for everything in the eu everything in the tv shows everything and any books like i doubt it
i doubt that's what he's saying yeah from foreshadowing that's all over the film raj
changes on this beckoning an explanation and that is fair enough i'm sure it wouldn't have
taken that long for it to explain the obvious yeah but yeah but that's the movie you want
that's the video that you want yeah he did bring that up before i'm assuming that
just keep coming shadowing in reference can you please point to the foreshadowing scene where
leah is an established force user to the point where she can save herself and then float through
the vacuum of space in order to save herself you have a that's not that's not that oh my god that's
so embarrassing quinton oh my god the fact that you put your face to this is embarrassing what the
fuck do you how does this explain that at all really we're going with this just yeah when leah
says luke says you've got the power to that means she could fucking survive with a sassy little snap
there too you actually think that because she has some connection to the force she can do that
without any training no training so she can just survive the vacuum of space float through
wow that's one big oof right there that is uh oh that is an oof oh you shouldn't have had your
face there let's let's get that let's get that beautiful little click again because uh yeah oh
fuck where am i going yeah that's bad quinton as challenges on this beckoning an explanation
and that is fair enough i'm sure it wouldn't have taken that long for it to explain the obvious
foreshadowing in reference can you please point to the foreshadowing scene where leah is an
established force user to the point where she can save herself and then float through the vacuum
of space in order to save herself you have a power i don't understand and could never have
she even says she doesn't understand the power you wet yeah but that means you can survive in
the vacuum of space that totally it just that's how that works rags she says the quote that she
doesn't even understand it i wonder how much quinton needs to actually just understand the
point what if leah was thrown into a star and then comes out of it okay would that be enough
for you would you finally go okay maybe that's a bit much maybe that's not explained so sassy
but if you're gonna be sassy be right oh god yeah that's preferable if you're gonna be sassy
you have that power too in time you'll learn to use you'll learn to use it as if luke has
regularly survived the vacuum of space oh my god arguably if we'd gotten to the end of
her use in the sequel trilogy and leah hadn't used the force that would have been an inherent
question the only the only part she uses the force is just when she senses luke yeah like
that's it there's no reason to and besides that's just basic bad storytelling to be like
she's a force user and then later like down the line she uses amazing force powers like why
wouldn't you show us that she's actually learned this shit instead of just saying yeah that's just
the way it works and besides i'm pretty sure either jj or ryan came out saying that leah
hasn't had any training like they said ryan's on who said that yeah they hadn't trained she just
she just could do this now he said that her doing it is the equivalent of parents being able to lift
cars off their children like in moments of great stress like you you get like hulk hulk-ish like
strength because of adrenaline and etc and that's why she's about it's just like okay ryan
just anything can happen at any point for any reason yeah we we went from like someone said
we went from sensing to levitation and sensing is the most passive low energy power like you
could possibly ever have it does it doesn't even require anything from you it's just that you're
observing something like good job you can observe a feeling in the force and you can't turn that
into any offensive or affirmative you know action in any way you go from that to jon als rags as
someone just pointed out uh do you remember when they reached the rocks in the end of the last
jedi and they're all like oh no we're screwed and then ray lifts them up why couldn't leah lift them
yeah i mean jeez if she's so powerful quinton you're fucking idiot man because there's an entire
scene it's almost consistently wrong and self-contradictory it's almost like the force powers
are exactly as powerful as the plot requires them to be it has nothing to do with actual
characters having skills because that would be they'll get in the way who needs that
it's bad okay it's not good when you do that in your story do i need to be this explicit
ridiculous so six just setting up the fact that in the future she will be able to use the force
you can say yeah it's a little bit different oh my god that pause though i don't know if you've
got a different pause to be but that's oh no it looks pretty shit it does have his faces
if you got my stream mary poppins is pretty yeah old lady floating around you know like mary poppins
does i just like the idea that leah like slowly moves a small stone with the force and then also
she survives in the vacuum of space and quinton's like yeah same thing he's using the force same
thing very strange this scene is goofy you can call it mary poppins s you can say it looks bad
but you can't say it's not so much about contradiction of the lore as it is that it's not
established we didn't care about the lore yeah like who cares we're not saying that it's
impossible for her to do it because we clearly she can because it's shown right he's taken the
same approach he took with yoda and the lightning it's that up until this point it basically she
just pulls this out of her asshole because the plot needs it yeah which is like a fundamental
we never like it in any film when they do that or in any story we don't like it when characters get
saved by a deus ex machina that's the point of the trope nobody likes it when something happens
and you're just like oh how convenient yeah it's it's lazy he's like but she saves herself with
her force powers you know it was like force powers yeah she has those now she can survive
the vacuum of space like oh from now on there's a lot of back and forth and discussion just makes
you forget what the original point was i actually was responding that's such a great point about this
video there's so much discussion left right and forth you have no idea what the hell the point
even is an argument the lack of explanation from the force had ruined it since when has star wars
ever established a force power before just doing it yeah i totally remember the exposition from ob
one explaining how the mind trick worked we don't need no it's not about that it's about the
contradiction like i doubt did you go on a rant about how force projection skype call shit
ruins the law rags i doubt it i i can't remember and it's actually handled what i would say is much
better they they use it for the payoff for luke in the end which i got my own issues with but the
fact is that they use it there when they've established it with just a nebulous little
conversation between the two of them at the beginning it's just like oh you establish and
then you pay off while the other ones yeah sure like we don't need it as long as it doesn't
contradict that's that's what we've been saying for the past like 10 minutes now there are obviously
tiers of force usage in their extremity and some that may require more explanation than others this
is a fair point to observe there is no real problem with this argument if you wanted more
explanation then that is fair enough some people just didn't view it as a necessity although i
personally think that there were elements that could have used a bit more such as layer's use
of the force in space not to detract from the good old banter didn't want to do a response
wait what sick burn in with the lads i'm confused i need to see that again you like skipped for me
people just didn't view it as a necessity although i personally think that there were
elements that could have used a bit more such as layers use of the force in space not to detract
from the good old banter raj gets a sick burn in with the lads saying that i can see why mauler
didn't want to do a response video to this because mauler is above such immature child play no no
no that's not what i'm in absolute god no it's only fair to just assume the worst right that's
no benefit of the doubt as we've said is another common trope of this video
but he just disagreed with quinton by the way when he said the the layer force thing that actually
is something that could use more explanation right well no it's just funny because it's like do you
guys even recognize the fact that you disagree when you're trying to work together to respond
to rags it's like person a says yeah rags you're wrong because of x and then person b says yeah
rags you're wrong wait no x is fair and it's just like what the fuck's happening a complete
in total like wow he thinks that that he thinks that's what i meant like even you at the end of
your last jedi videos you talk about the you mentioned the mauler or the iad video i responded
to it it's a video you can find on the part three description i did it with two friends for the fun
of it so it's oh i meant i meant with um i meant at the uh you mentioned it in your last jedi review
oh yeah yeah and then i think later on you decided yeah sure why the hell not well those people
requested it they're like please do a lie it's actually a progenitor for efap like it's kind of
like efap what is in that video um let me um actually can you if you have a link if you have
a link for it can you put it in our discord thing because i'd like to look at it bear in mind i
have no idea what's even said on it at this point because it's been so long uh but i remember it being
funny i am with my video i can't even remember what i said it was so long ago let me see if i can
should be in my list somewhere but it's nice to be proven right just not in i'm sure he didn't
think that he would do that but yeah i mean let's be honest man this video this video's been a mess
like uh we've joined harmful opinions godhood yeah like i'm god yeah yeah i need to i need to
take that from his video as a caption it this but unironically there it is um yeah thanks much uh
so yeah just oh there's gonna say because we covered a lot of shitty videos on this podcast
but like oh yeah it's got movie bob in the title it's funny that every one of them is like a
different kind of bad like they all have their different uh i don't know the ways you break them
down oh yeah patrick willams and movie bob and they're all different they're they're their own
special kind of i hate we're doing pretty well i think they wouldn't have it doing the other way
doing bigger chunks of the video we're getting through it again through it sick burning with
we've we're two hours and uh 18 minutes okay we can go a bit longer it's not bad
glad saying that i can see why mauler didn't want to do a response video to this because mauler is
above such immature child's play the god the man the mauler and if we set the snide comments aside
there are no it's just it's just such a bizarre inference that rags is calling me a god it's like
i don't think so yeah i'm no no i'm just like this video is frustrating and i could see why he
mauler wouldn't want to do it because videos frustrate also my arguments in the section that
are relevant in fact there are some very good points regards to false equivalences made there
is a spectrum of false extensions some more reasonable others the rag does slightly get
caught up in himself at the end of this part seeming to take i h e sarcastic comment about
leah being poor sensitive being bad writing seriously don't even get me started on how luke
and leah can all of a sudden read each other's minds bad writing alert bad writing hacks no no
no let me get this straight so leah is for sensitive and she can sense other for sensitive
people all right that's been established that's okay that's that's that's bad writing but
leah who has received no force training gets jettisoned into space protects herself in a
in the vacuum of space and then flies herself back into a ship that's good writing yeah so just to
clarify for a tro because he's clearly not getting it uh so i hate everything is trying to imply
that the error the the point in empire that she shouldn't be able to sense luke is just as bad as
leah being able to survive in the vacuum of space yeah and you have to explain that because there's
not really much setup for these clips yeah and so obviously you're saying are you serious that
your defense is that it's just as bad that this thing exists in this other film it's like no it's
not and he's going to say that it was clearly a joke from i hate everything you've taken seriously
and so doesn't count that's how that works oh even if it was it's like okay yeah it's as if you
can't criticize a joke jokes are immune to criticism yeah i still wasn't wrong either way
it's point wasn't that it was bad writing but if certain elements of the force being used in the
past wasn't bad writing then this couldn't be bad either what about ism in its finest form
we don't even give a shit right now we're talking about something specific and you're like but it's
bad at the other thing it's like doesn't even matter well in this other movie it's like okay
well that's another movie we're not talking about that movie yep with that said there is a
distinction that was pointed out however once we move on from that there is a point about the
prequels where i actually didn't like the use of force i was going to say it seems like they
swapped evidence but i haven't seen a name swap yet so i guess not yeah because i because they
have the text with his words now which is uncommon the way the force is used in the prequels it's
too much like a video game for me it contradicts pretty much everything from the original story
in the prequels you had a whole jedi temple you had jedi you spanned we said this too i
hate everything uh in our conversation i said if you had a massive amount of jedi and they all
could use the force and then they were all fighting people would you not expect force use
like how did you how would wouldn't it be a contradiction to not have the force being used
yeah and he was like it contradicts everything in the original i was like how and it's like
because yoda says like you should be more uh passive or you should be more defensive or
it's like that's yoda who's saying that for one all the other jedi didn't say that and two uh
how do we know that yoda didn't develop that perspective thanks to the prequels
like he was like look at all this war and this bloodshed so you should use it for distance
yeah i don't see what's unwise or like excessive you know it's i i don't think it's being flippant
using the force in combat like if anything that would be the time to use it yeah that's
that's kind of where i'm coming from i feel like this is the place to use the force when you find
armies of droids you can throw them away you can yeah of all the places to use it defending your
life and fighting for justice is probably the number one place to use it like that's why even
in episode two they did do the um the fast run at the beginning of the prequels in episode one i
don't know if you remember that they do like a yeah the droidekas roll up and which um i'd need
to think about it but if there is an instance where jedi could have used that um oh yeah like
like people always highlight obi-wan could have used it to catch up with qui-gon in uh the finale
uh there's obviously the argument but he was very tired it would be like yeah i know but it just
it seems really unnecessary to have the speedy run because it doesn't really do much it's almost
like it was an editing thing to just get him yeah like a poor editing done for coolness but yeah
but again you start to realize like hang on why are we talking about this it's like
the whether or not the prequels uh contradicted it's like we're talking about whether or not the
sequels do so even if the prequels did or did not contradict that doesn't change whether or not
whatever yeah and and to assist my point um in episode two you have anakin eating with padme
and he floats the fruit into his hand and he says obi-wan wouldn't like be doing this
like that would be like a flippant use of the force that probably isn't necessary it's done to
maybe show off yeah you know but in combat that would be completely different story
across the galaxy they use their force i mean it makes even more sense that in the context of the
prequels jedi who are the protectors of peace who had a martial role to fulfill would use this
obvious power for that purpose it is appropriate that in the prequels the jedi use so much force
powers yep it makes sense in the universe that they're in in the setting that they're in it just
it just makes sense and although you could make the argument that the force makes sense in the
prequels it does seem cartoonish and definitely detracts from the charm but that's not an argument
it seems cartoonish it detracts from the charm both of those things would be subjective
yeah unless you can actually get some more definitive language because okay if it seems
cartoonish to you what am i gonna do like okay yeah i mean it's you can't use the force in combat
like i gotta be honest because it looks too cartoonish whenever tro is going to agree with
you rags you'll find the most distant way of agreeing with you possible yeah man that's i
mean do you think that they honestly would be telling their here's your labor here's your
laser support it cuts through anything except other lasers and it protects your life um but
the force you can't use that in a fight for your life or to save other people because it
might look cartoonish yeah i just don't get it it's it doesn't hold up at all and yeah
so as i just said leah's flag was cartoonish it's like yeah absolutely it looked dumb as
fucking as compared to mary poppins like you ugh from my point of view and i think they're both
reasonable standpoints then there's a case of what people wanted luke to be i h e says that
he wouldn't want to see luke fly around the next wing and kill stormtroopers with a lightsaber
sweet to me that sounds like possibly the worst thing ever ransok has to respond yeah that would
have been so out of character for luke to do those things but you know what would have been
the character for luke skywalker murdering his best friend's son while he slept i love how clean
that point is i'm waiting for how he's gonna skew it like it's his opinion it's a joke it's
hyperbolic it's like all rags are sad is it it would make sense for luke to attack stormtroopers
and fly around in the next wing i'm glad i haven't watched my video in months because i get to hear
the joke over again it's like i forgot about it yeah that makes way more sense i i totally agree
that would total sense once again i see both sides i won't make more sense i see both sides
i see i see what's up but which one makes more sense murdering his best friend's son while he
slept yeah that makes way more sense i i totally agree that would total sense once again i see
both sides i wanted something different but i definitely didn't want a completely buoyant x-wing
luke either even in light of the original arm we're talking about what you want we're talking
about what makes sense god damn it it makes total sense for luke to fight stormtroopers
and fly in an x-wing that's like his thing i'm not saying this is the thing you haven't
said that that's what you want you've said that's what makes sense and when you haven't said that's
what not what it's just like why are you changing the conversation rags hasn't said oh let's discuss
what everybody wants out of this film just like it's just about being in character has he forgotten
that luke is like an established character and hell i would hell fucking take that in a million
times over what we go on the last jedi hell yeah i will i'll take badass john wick style luke
over this mopey grumpy sad uncle who just wants to die he just wants to die like yeah of course i'll
fucking take the fucking former a lot has changed once again i think rags takes ihc's comparison
to yoda too literally sounds way too similar to what we got with yoda in the prequels the
comparison to yoda is clearly a lot more on don't don't turn in fear what i hear everything was
saying and that was very strictly obvious he said that if luke was in an x-wing flying around
or killing stormtroopers it would be too close to what we got with yoda in the prequels
which is what the fuck like this is just a weird yeah there's so many questions first of all was
what they did with yoda bad was what they did with yoda out of character was what they did
with yoda in the prequels even relevant to an idea of doing it in the sequels would luke doing
that be definitively bad could what yoda have done in the prequels have been done good if they
had a better director slash writer it's like so many questions and he just throws it all out he's
just like nah luke doing that too much like yoda doing that okay such substantive arguments man
it's like i thought it was like i think most people after watching the last jedi would be
like hell yeah i don't have a cool badass luke jeez no it's offensive just a changing of the
character level with new context is like yoda in the prequel with that it would have seemed more
out of character well he's he's like it's like yoda the prequels with it it's like a picture of
ray it's like uh why did it have a hair and then back to luke but um it's gonna be an overall
point about luke i think new context it's like yoda in the prequel with that it would have seemed
more out of character for his presented age and maturity i think it's a tough job to reim it would
have seemed out of character i love that he has to keep saying that instead of actually it is
definitively out of character in the film or it would have seemed to to maybe have done the other
thing it's like i'll take seams over is he's like and i into the point about it wouldn't be right
because he's old no man yeah we've we've heard that many times from the not so great debate we're
just like make an argument without saying he's old okay well he's old yeah man stop
invent a character and although i agree i don't really like the luke we had i can't say i would
have preferred a energetic youthful luke because age is meant to change a person once again to
necessarily be energetic and you don't have to prefer it rags is talking about what's consistent
how much energy does it take to sit on your ass in an x-wing
yeah i know he's he's implying it's like bombastic and then and then it's a false
dichotomy as well it's like we could have had anything in between could have had luke who's
just a stoic uh you know commander of sorts and he's he's trying to get the best thing done with
the situation at hand instead of being like i want to go to my island and die like oh that sounds
okay you're not necessarily to what we got but i think using an old arc to lend expectation to
a new one is objectionable as well so i can see why i h e took issue with it so no it's not
dishonest to compare the two this discussion comes back to i h e calling this so my pauses
are taking ages to come through now it's kind of weird uh not objectionable to compare the two i'm
not even sure that what did you say it was objectionable to compare the two rather than
just pointing out that it's not out of character for luke to kill stormtroopers i think that's all
i said we don't even know because he's just telling us that yeah god my way of editing is
mean and offensive some racks disagree characters yeah i got like i got like a five second delay
on the pause play button right now well then i think my internet's actually like
tears me up a bit and hopefully it gets better behaving and believable in established ways than
a universe that makes sense for to have them doing the things that they're doing is not useless
fan service but nothing particularly new is stated here this is nothing more than a fundamental
disagreement yielding a further disagreement then it is vanity pointed out by i achieved that hamill
expressed a changing of mind on the project before sharing the context of this rags them retorts that
a statement like this is outweighed by all the footage shown and then assumes hamill's intentions
that he's trying to keep the peace yeah guys he made a twitter post that totally has far more
meaning and weight than the things he said to his audience this is the problem with the decontextualized
interviews that have been shown they present well yeah the interviews that you didn't play
the interviews that you had in your video tro that were edited so fast we could not hear them
yeah don't you fucking talk about the interviews out of context you piece of shit
yeah i don't think you can talk on the subject he can't talk on the subject because he's
ignored the evidence and not prevented presented it so why even bother it's just like there this
is insane coming from him talking about how the interviews are out of context and he played them
sped up so fast you could not get context like fuck man i'm really tired of the no context
arguments as well it's like mark hamill makes definitive statements that don't require a context
to improve or deprove what he means by them because he's very clear the jedi do not do what
they do in this film luke would not do what he does in this film it's like simple and then you
go well what other context where he says he likes the film it's like that doesn't change what he just
said i mean i am shocked that people would be like oh yeah hamill likes what they do
like no dude that's insane such a sultry atmosphere of a miserable mark hamill
it is hard to forget how anticipative he clearly was of the film throughout multiple interviews
even in a lot of the interviews that he talks about creative differences he does not see for
i was gonna and yeah he doesn't like show clips of him being really excited about the film he
just says that that's a thing that happens don't show all those clips i had in my video of the
thing that you said he wasn't doing that might make your point seem a little wrong wouldn't it
so you can't be having that one team is claiming there's there's a lack of context and they show
no clips another team is claiming that the other person lacks context and they show clips it's like
which one am i going to believe more probably the one that shows clips
to support their arguments tends to be a bit better personally
but i just can't really stand to see mark hamill destroyed and sad on the inside
personally i find this constant moral hammering of mark hamill quotes to be pretty tiring
moral hammering as both mauler and rags try to argue when mark hamill is lying and they're
when mark hamill is lying show me a clip where i said mark hamill was lying you piece of shit
yeah i never said mark hamill lied saying that mark hamill's lying because i know what he's
referring to it's going to be the uh when people say mark hamill was positive about the film that
we said no that's a lie i never said that was a lie i love how he says it that way by the way rags
where he goes lying because he knows we didn't say that he's saying it yeah i was like are you
begging the question are you trying to lead you know the audience somewhere but again like this
is not shocking coming from quinton it's just standard standard for this seems to be based
entirely around when he does or does not agree with them what he says yeah it was only i didn't
show clips of mark saying the things that disagree with what i think it was only things that he
he agrees with that agrees with me it's not like in my videos i actually said that mark has been
positive about the film and that it's likely because he wants to try and die down the actual
toxic discussions it's not like that's the thing that i have said in my fucking videos that you
apparently watched quinton you said in this video that you watched them if anything i mean it's
possible hamel was lying because his tweet goes against everything that was said by him previously
but he was he could have been doing it from a good place like he could have been like
godly could and besides those were like two different issues just way to way to demonize
me and rags it's like must be so much fun to just argue this way luke can simultaneously
say both of those things and there's not a lie right he can call for unity and he could say that
the movie isn't bad he can do that he could say that he's proud of the film and everything
and at the same time he can also express how he doesn't like the way his character was done
yeah those are not contradictory things and as you can hear right now me and rags are happy
to accept that luke mark hamel thinks the film is good that is fine so it's absolutely okay
i think the film is good yeah but it is odd if he's depending on what mark said
it would be strange considering all of his behavior prior to that
what's the thing if you were to ask him he did lie in or about his feelings in order to
be unified to yeah that's the other thing who knows if he actually lied to staunch the
you know like it's possible
it depends on what was actually said like this is such a bizarre point because uh
maybe he was lying for a good cause
also my again it's like showing out give me one second i'm going to try and see what
quite there i can't hear you i'm going to try and see if i can uh make my internet a bit better
hang on yeah
this is like a on on discord it says i've got like uh one bar which is not reassuring
i'm trying to enable my ethernet it's not working
connect ya bastard last thing i need is to actually disconnect entirely that would be bad
uh i don't want to risk stopping the entire stream so that'd be really annoying so i guess
i'll just have to go with it can you hear me probably not i can hear you and you're coming
through all right yeah it's like a really big delay so it seems to be what's happening
one hour 1406 oh yeah that's fine i'm just trying to um give me one second i might disconnect for
a little bit all right do you want me to go through like well i guess i can't i can only see
so many all right i got you yeah it says i'm connected with ethernet but it's like super
fucking slow okay that's not reassuring at all
people we have people in the stream are saying uh they can hear you
yeah it's weird uh i've got no control of my free up some ram the cringe caused an overflow
it's like i've got i can't i can choose between a wired connection or a wireless one and uh
sometimes they offer different results it's really weird and so i'm trying to watch together
i'm trying to switch them right now and it's not even letting me uh do anything with my internet
connections which seem to be a bit broken not reassuring at all
yeah because it's disconnected my wi-fi successfully but i can still talk to you
which means my internet is still connected very very odd i apologize for anybody who's
waiting to actually have things happen while i sort this out
it says my wi-fi is disabled and i have the option to disable it it's like
any second now i'm expecting to just go down
mr efap i don't feel so good
yeah it's bizarre it says even on discord it just says i'm connecting
let's hope the stream is still up i don't hear rags anymore
all right now it's probably gone down
f's can you hear me oh i can hear you now i have no idea what i'm even connected to
both my ethan and my wi-fi are disconnected but somehow i'm talking to you all right i guess
they couldn't hear me for a while but i that's that strange connection stuff because i couldn't
hear you uh the stream didn't go down but apparently they couldn't hear me but we should be back i
think it went down for a few seconds hopefully it's back up uh something like that but you're
hearing me pretty quickly so let's just hope that that's let's just carry on shall we uh
14 1405 we should yeah one yeah pretty much when he says something bad about the movie well that's
when he says something bad about the movie well that's him stating his opinion and we should feel
bad for him and we should cut that quote out and put it in our videos what who is it
wait wait they point out that we played the same clips it's like yes yeah i'm i'm so first off
that's not my name my name is not rag second off if you do a review on the last jedi
and somebody else does a review on the last jedi and you both have footage from the last jedi
do you think that it's a legitimate criticism of both of your videos if you play the same footage
no the second that you have a similar clip from any source you're invalid like you you're pushing
an agenda does he realize that if you go to youtube and you type in mark hamill the third
thing that pops up is mark hamill hates the last jedi and these are videos that have
hundred millions of views this is one with five million views three hundred seventy thousand
one hundred fifty thousand six hundred seventy thousand like these are these have millions of
views on youtube are well i mean the narrative here is that we only play clips that support our
arguments when again i accounted for it in my videos so idiots not understand that at that
especially at the time it was like one of the first things is not the first thing popping up for his
name especially but these like these are clips that have millions and millions and millions of views
like these are really big popular clips of course we'll both use them it's him saying the thing
exactly and and to to imply the again in my video i account for the positive things that
mark has said they're ignoring that and it's really bugging me but uh you know they're talking
about using specific clips to sell a narrative and it's exactly what they've done to us and we
didn't even do it in the first place this is why this video is so fundamentally bad in so many ways
this is awful quinson like you're just a shitty person
like you've just you're just not your arguments are garbage but holy fuck you're just a shitty
person for doing this definitely doing shitty things like it's like how do you how do you expect
me and rags to respond to this shit like we're just gonna go oh yeah that's totally fair it's
like yeah it's like of course we fucking use the same clips we're both trying to make the
same point in support of our overall agreement that this film was terrible because both mauler
and rags try to argue when mark hamill is lying and they're i love he just doesn't show a clip of
that too that's a big claim that me and rags is saying that mark lies at certain points is short
for joseph stalin but you'd think like if we claimed that he was lying in a particular clip
that would be a clip worth showing you know you'd think but i mean they can't be fucked
to show the rest of my clips really just little tiny bits standard for this seems to be based
entirely around when he does or does not agree with them when he says to make bad about the movie
that's him stating his opinion and we should feel bad for him and we should cut that quote
out and put it in our videos i mean yeah how did the most optimistic hopeful character they're
playing this as if it's some kind of revelation yeah we have similar clips yeah these are videos
on youtube that have millions of views there's like 50 different instances of him saying this
stuff me and rags have drawn many and some of them are going to be the same because how would
they not be and i and i asked you for where you got some of them exactly yeah i remember
you said i sent you a link yeah i was like yeah i was like i said the interviews that you showed
you know i because i asked you if they were full interviews or just clips because i wanted to get
you know like the full interview see what else was in those interviews and i messaged you and
said can you link me to them and i question how the hell would we even know if this is from our
videos what all you've done is play the clip out of context with rags is video and maulers video on
it it wouldn't even matter because everybody on youtube who has a video of this clip playing
will be the exact same because it's the same interview playing and you know what's hilarious
to think is that someone could be like have you noticed that uh tro's videos and rags and maulers
all share this one clip of mark hamill as if to try and sell it so that he's unhappy and then we
just play this like oh look your video has the clip in it now yeah yeah exactly yeah now your
video has the clip in it we already know they're running an agenda here as well so it's kind of
just funny to point all these things out the character in the galaxy turned into this hermit
but when he says that he likes it no he's lying he's trying to keep the peace he's not being honest
yeah did you catch that did you catch that he's lying he's trying to keep the peace he's not
being honest what i said was i think he's trying to actually calm everyone down yeah that's it i
never said he was lying he might be he doesn't think we don't know we don't know for sure
if i saw all of those clips of the way that he felt about you know the film and the movie
and then he comes out and tweets something i'll be like yeah he's probably lying just to keep
everybody together you know but if anything i can believe that he's like kind of a good guy
it's like he goes from being very aggressively negative about the film's choices and then
soon after loads of interviews coming out where he's like nah okay you know let's let's it's just
a movie you know it's fine don't worry about it like don't need to get so angry about it it's fine
ryan johnson that's what we do we ruined childhoods we see that clip where it's like yeah he's just
trying to die it down he's like okay let's calm down we don't need to actually start threatening
to fucking lose our shit over a movie because ultimately that's what that's what it is but it's
that's mark hamill's perspective on the subject like we that's which is his opinion i can't believe
i'm saying this that's mark hamill's opinion quinted that's that's that's down to him
doesn't mean that the stuff he said before didn't happen but our opinion is above his so
our opinion super he's just lying that part doesn't count don't don't put that in the video
i've had trouble accepting what he saw for luke but again i mean i have to say having seen the
movie i was wrong which of those things is more like what hamill the actual interview on there
also so i i can't i yeah as far as wasn't the actual interview yeah as if like we could have
just done the exact same thing to tiara we could have said see played that clip out of context let
me show you the actual interview and then you play our clip yeah and it's like oh so what you're
arguing is that me and rag should have played the entire interview in our videos very strange
too we're not going to do that we're trying to prove that luke disapproved of uh that mark
disapproved of luke's uh character choices we show the clip in which he says it we move on
do you have a problem with that it's like basic jiddleism yeah and right now here's the thing
i'm not ready to take quinton at his word no yeah when he plays a clip that doesn't have
complete full and total context before what mark is saying here
like i'm i can't i can't do that anymore with most people i'll give him the benefit of the doubt but
i can't definitely i cannot do that with quinton i am perfectly ready to you know accept that he
lied about things that he's done in the past and you can tell as well you can't trust quinton
just the tone of of like and the delivery of what mark is saying it's very like okay but i don't
i don't hate like it's it's not it's not as bad as i'm just made it sound
you know why would you have to say it like that you know he's he's clearly straddling the line
between what he feels and what go away unknown caller and he's and mark is very aware of that
his words go far so he's obviously trying to be very careful as of fighting out uh where his words
are going you know and is someone saying that i put the tweet saying he liked it yeah it's like i
apparently um and yeah like i said in my video he didn't play the audio clip after the interview
when mark hamill goes home and lives his daily life and like i said i said that i i'm pretty
sure the words i say in my script mark has gone back on some of the things he said i think i say
that in my videos but i know that i definitely account for the fact that he said positive things
about the film i made sure to so that people like quinton couldn't say this but they didn't
fucking work did it yeah are not a higher authority on what mark hamill means
than mark hamill himself yeah neither are you quinton yeah so that's the end of that
composition the thing that you're accusing us of doing again no that's a huge surprise
weird they cannot claim that they're inside of his mind uh do you remember claiming you were
inside mark hamill's mind rags no i just i just make inferences based off of all the information
i have at my disposal i i remember it the opening of my videos i said um i've been inside mark
hamill's mind i i shrunk myself down and looked at everything he feels and thinks so uh yeah
thank you for bringing that up quinton though i think it would have been better to show the clip
of me saying it just putting it out there as a suggestion for next time because they are not i
do not accept them trying to sit around and cherry pick which mark hamill quotes count and which ones
do not yeah we didn't say that so fuck you all this emotional mark hamill content has escalated
to the point where it is reasonable to read mark hamill's mind and state his intentions like we
know them better than anyone else yeah we didn't do that so fuck you how many times i have to say
this i mean it's like how many times do you have to see mark hamill just dejected and sad you know
it's funny uh we play all these clips and then their takeaway from it is rags and mola think
they're inside his mind it's like we played his clips it's like i just can't you just look at the
clip this is again this is when it comes to the right opinion this is why maybe he didn't
play those clips like i noticed no it's noticed that so far we haven't seen any clips of hamill
you know except for that one instance of where he put ours by side by side but he did that to make
us you know try and look bad for stupid reason but he hasn't actually played out those clips
of him saying the things that we say he says they deliberately avoided having those clips be played
yeah like again for the chat the most insidious things that are said about me and rags
always have no clip to follow it's like oh yeah they are this and they say this i'm not going to
show you a clip of that because it's just clear that that's the case like uh-huh very glad like
what's the biggest thing we've put against quinton in this entire stream of both streams is the fact
that he completely repurposed a quote from rags to make him say something he didn't and we proved it
we didn't put that as that we played the clip from rags because i did it on the stream obviously i
don't know if rags heard that but he would have seen it as well it's just the the very big difference
between doing research and showing you're working and you know what that does it makes you have long
videos you know that's something that happens when you try and prove your points i'm not saying
that you can't have a short video that proves points i'm not saying that you can't have long
videos that don't prove points i'm saying that it's very lame to uh take two hours to make this
video not even include the most damning quotes you have to make them up this is where i'm coming from
just cherry picking
because of these compilations if the twitter post follows the interviews then yes his feelings may
have changed and you have no reason to assume we do we're just going by we're going by what he has
said and i will put i will i will every day i'll put actual live interviews of him with his face
and his tone and his expression the words he says that come out of his mouth above a twitter post
i'll do that any day of the week
and yeah they're spending so long on this point when it's just wrong from the base about what we
did so may as well skip past otherwise regards of how much you'd like to hypothesize that he's
trying to keep the peace it is just well you know what tro it's just our opinion then isn't it
yeah it's our opinion of why mark is doing what he's doing yeah why can't you just let us have
our opinion like you sell that as your fucking defense throughout this entire video but then
you like just don't afford it to us whenever you want to criticize they don't know they don't know
this they can't be inside his mind yeah but as if that's a counter to something we've said like
that we've said of course we're inside his mind yeah but we back it up we're like look at all
these clips look at all the things he said look at his face look at the way he acts look at all
these examples that back up the thing that we say and you're like oh yeah you don't have absolute
certainty of what his actual thoughts are like okay and it just so happens that the people saying
that the people who fucking love the last jedi is like oh i mean aside from tro i suppose but in
fairness we don't know what he thinks about the mark camel cliffs because he's just defending i
hate everything so like he has to go against this point no matter what his position is already
solidified by the fact that you criticize i hate everything on it it's just really strange that
when you go online and you see all of these people looking at him like the vast majority
i'm not saying it's right because of this but the vast majority of people come away
with the impression that he was really bummed out about it and this is the thing this is this is a
point where i didn't even think that would be a controversial thing if you guys watch the
interviews that are done on the red carpet or like the press stuff they're always so positive
and so nebulous they'll be like oh yeah the film is amazing because it has the best stuff in it and
things and it's great and you should go see it not only was mark negative he was specific
actions character character wants it said in the chat they can't be inside is
a hypothesis in the interviews oh yeah they'll know exactly what we're thinking but we can't
know what mark's thinking oh boy where mark camel says he still hasn't fully accepted the character
he then goes on to say that he believes ryan johnson was the best man for the job are you going to
say he's also gone on to say that if the film is bad that's ryan johnson's fault how about we play
that clip here's the thing man if you say two things back to back that are inherently contradictory
it's just one of them's just not going to be true
that's the thing it may maybe you don't realize it at the time when you say it that doesn't mean
that you're saying these things in malafide days you know but that's just the way it is i mean
feelings don't matter in that scenario it was him being truthful and the next is just him trying
to keep the peace you can't just pick and choose what parts of mark camel are being honest to suit
your agenda why are you then playing the clips and we're hypothesis with the point that also
sorry the pause delayed as fuck for me um yeah like it just refrained from showing us a clip
where we say he's lying or although he's being honest just keep stop doing that so we can't
actually account for what we've actually said just keep saying that's what we said you're inside
our mind tiaro actors are not writers or directors necessarily creative conflict between actors and
directors is incredibly common but your job as an actor is to fulfill the director's vision
not the other way around ranks them response that's not even who cares when that's not even
the point it's not like if mark's my opinion if mark hamill says the film is bad that doesn't
make the film bad of course that's just true but is it not interesting the guy who's connected to
luke skywalker the closest the guy who actually plays him has said that it's a complete betrayal
of his character do you do you not think that's interesting to think about
yeah it's not proof that the film is bad it's a very interesting piece of information
yeah it's certainly yeah it's certainly worth you know worth thinking about in great detail
like why would he think that and then he'd be like wow that's that's pretty big of an actor
to openly say that in interviews like he must be he must have felt pretty uh emotional about that
uh yeah he was pretty convinced
shit and was at odds with the established lore of the universe and the characters that had
experienced and earned their arcs prior either these statements really contradict each other
they're both valid in their own way where more dispute comes into play is where i hate everything
then suggests the fact that disney was willing to hand the biggest franchise over to one guy
who has never directed anything close to the scale before is commendable ranks counters this
by suggesting that it was wildly irresponsible both of these points have merit there is a wholesome
appeal to content not churned out by studios with suits and often it can have more heart
but it also means the scope for failure is a lot more wild and there's a lot less control
and accounting for creative decisions rags returns i mean and and looking back in hindsight i mean
tell me i'm wrong tell me i'm fucking wrong now that we've had all these months to watch what's
happening with star wars tell me i'm fucking wrong inspired by criticizing i actually placing
blame on jj abrams for introducing unexplored concept honestly i think a lot of the blame for
some of the fans problems with the story should be more on the shoulders of jj abrams he's so
obsessed with this mystery box idea well that's just the thing isn't it the force awakens for
all of its flaws did something really well and that was set up a potential amazing sequel it
really depends on whether you think the ideas that jj abrams presented do you disagree with that
no uh literally get the greatest writer in the world and they can work with what jj provided as
a base yeah i'm kind of asking tro here like out you know out in the eighth year i'm just like is
that something that really you think is i don't really controversial enough to i don't love his
obsession with the mystery box but it's more to do with the fact that jj doesn't know how to pay off
he knows how to set up because it doesn't take much to set up that's what i hear about him all
the time yeah and that's the thing so i'm happy to throw jj at the beginning i wouldn't have a
moment project at all to be honest there's other things i have issues with but uh you could have
had a great the last jedi that was a follow-up to the force awakens
were workable enough to condense into the next director's storyline the best analogy that i can
think of is that it's like abram's building a framework for the next movie but if the next
director comes along with a different idea then the framework may have to be adjusted with certain
parts ignored yeah well that's not his prerogative he can't just ignore what came before when he's
making a fucking sequel what do you think a sequel is yeah what's the yeah if he if you ignore the
framework if you just go off and do your own thing entirely if you don't stay faithful to what came
before you what's the point of it being a sequel yeah you may as well just say oh this is a spin-off
movie called star wars luke is a coward this is the project i'm running with and watch how many
people want to go see that out of all the spin-offs you can make jeez naught now whether that's on
abram's or not is completely subjective hopefully this was caution for the studio to think it's not
subjective think about what they set it up in their film before they hand it over this discussion is
followed through to specific examples like snoke and though i do concur that johnson should take
the blame for not exploring snoke and raised parents at all having two no no raised parents
were done that part of the movie was finished it was pretty much it was over we didn't we didn't
we it was done we the problem is um with snoke anyway like i always the big problem with snoke
is that he makes everything happen in this sequel trilogy he's the big connecting force between the
originals and the new ones it's like snoke uh turned kylo he brought the first order back
and he basically crushed the republics like okay so who is he where did he come from what's his
nobody's dead yeah and it's just like okay okay fuck you movie uh and i'm just waiting for it to
be like it's subjective if you want to give snokes history i'm just curious research vast
concepts would have been a lot to work into a script though i did feel snoke especially
could have used more background and frankly i think a lot of the audience for these films
didn't care about these things oh where do we begin with that statement oh okay i am curious
how you have reached that conclusion yeah what's uh what's your criteria there quinton
pointed out by both mauler and rags there are scenes in both sequel trilogy movies discussing
how the lineage of ray doesn't matter and as for snoke who cared about holy shit really
who cared about quinton quinton uh so do you want to just um say i cared in chat if you
cared about where snoke came from i cared yes i cared about the overarching villain of a trilogy
i cared jesus christ i certainly don't care anymore because they fucking ruined it but uh
i cared who cares about this incredible or incredibly important central character to the
plot of the trilogy who cares who cares about literally what explains why the sequels even
take place who cared who cares you're right quinton who cares who cares i've seen a lot of
reviews where people said that smell because no that's a different thing that's totally different
yeah besides whose fault is that to say it's a boring character it's like uh and if anything
that's like a self-fulfilling prophecy they wrote him to be boring so then people didn't
care because he was boring like he's important more arguably even in the original trilogy
darth vader was the one that everyone cared about and the emperor was just sort of a generic
slightly more evil baddie that darth vader we had palpatine's history he was in control of the
empire the empire is an established government that essentially lords over the galaxy we the
stakes are set and then palpatine's destroyed and yet the first order still exists and there's a
new palpatine it's like what where did that come from well yeah now that everything's been set up
and established we're like oh people always where we are now is different than where we used to be
people always relate to how palpatine is the same as snoke which for one thanks to the prequels you
can't say that so yes give it up and two uh we didn't have any information before episode four
so we didn't know we didn't need to know how palpatine got to where he is we just need to be
told that's how it works but when you make a sequel to his seven fall and destruction and
then just say no everything's the same that doesn't make any fucking sense it's the idea
as well that you don't need a history and a character because they're boring i just don't
know what you think you're arguing at that point in terms of a positive quality it's like who needs
the good stuff when you don't even want words just words thoughts sort of the coherent ideas
who needs them god quinton's stellar at this he was like obsessed with responding to my videos
it's like could you imagine how bad it would have been if he had oh jeez later could kill
so that he could be avenged and suddenly be a good guy no one really cared about the emperor before
the prequels he was just we have the prequels uh do i need to ask who got who in chat cared about
palpatine before the prequels it's like are you fucking kidding me stop saying these sentences
if they're true this is exactly what they say that we do christ's sake are you gonna what are you
doing quinton let's let's just give him the same uh attitude that tro gives us uh rags hey quinton
have you got inside the minds of every single person who ever watched star wars is that what
you've done let's do let's do better let's say let's go with him let let's go with his idea that
nobody cared about palpatine who cares we're talking about snoke exactly it's what about
it's so bad let's go with the fact that nobody cared about palpatine he was just there to be
whatever fine we're not talking about palpatine from this other movie we're talking about snoke
from this movie and the previous movie all right try to stay focused this what about ism does not
help film that we were all waiting to die and there was basically no attempt to do anything
other than make him look evil and kill him off and no one really expected them to do anything
else in my personal opinion taking the head evil baddie and having him get killed off and replaced
with kylo ren which doesn't make sense but go on well that's the most interesting thing they could
have done because it leaves us at a point that says a lot about your fucking capacity for imagination
and we didn't dispute whether or not it's interesting to kill off a leading baddie
as a concept that could be very interesting it's their execution and the fact that they forgot to
give him a fucking history i mean ryan clearly and the thing is ryan was clearly aware of it he
had that stupid snoke theory card i just i love the idea of telling the star wars community they
don't really care about palpatine it's sad jeez no star wars but remember he can get into our heads
not just individual heads but but that of x many people oh yes for god forbid
done something like this before for the first time in a long time i feel like i can confidently
go into episode nine knowing that it's going to be something that i haven't seen in a star wars
movie yes star wars has never been this fucked before exactly there's nothing we can't expect
anything anymore because there's nothing to work with they're going to have to invent a shit ton
of stuff to actually have a storyline because another there's got nothing to work with i mean
yeah you're never going to see anything like it but people people always say that right before
the worst movie they've ever seen too i'm glad you're so invested in episode nine quinton you
you go girl yeah before and really think about it what reveal could they have possibly done that
would have been satisfying in any way that's fucking ridiculous he's saying that they couldn't
have come up with something what a sad piece of advice for writers this is this guy is a reviewer
and he's like hey writers why even bother doing something with snoke other than just killing him
what would be interesting beyond there's nothing that you could have done that's interesting about
snow you couldn't i mean like really quinton before these stupid words left your fat lips you
couldn't have gone online like googled snoke theory and now they're not interested all of
the really neat things none of them are interested they're all born okay no one cares what's
interesting slice him in half and make him fall over and then everyone laughs at his corpse
that's way better as i you exactly as video gamer says in the chat you couldn't have done
better so screw it don't don't bother give up writers just don't bother writing anything good
don't bother just he's dead no story no nothing just don't fucking bother when it comes to snoke
there's this video called how star wars should have ended it's a part of that series most of
you guys probably know it and they did a pitch for how the last jet i should have ended and it
looks like a much worse film but they included a scene where it turned out that snoke was darth
plagueus okay so many people had yeah and it was done in jest obviously you can see right here
they're like he's darth plagueus y'all because it's like we'll settle for that now because obviously
the idea of it being nobody's suck fuck it i'll take it yeah snoke is darth plagueus the wise
let's do it i was not expecting them to do darth plagueus i was not expecting them to do
jar jar binks i was not expecting them to do mace windu i was not fucking expecting them to do
nothing that shit is the last fucking thing i was expecting them to do holy crap and it's like oh
yeah well you just didn't like it because you didn't expect it it's like no they could have done mace
windu and i wouldn't have expected it i would have been like oh okay i wonder what that means
and it's like if it was darth plagueus at least it would have made sense
we were like oh right it's like i'll i'll take it man i'll take it and yeah again to to echo
the right opinion here how it should have ended is a comedy channel it's all done as a joke quinton
so you're not allowed to take them seriously sorry jokes can be better jokes that are meant
to be jokes can be better than the joke that you are here well this is the thing i think we can
seriously deconstruct uh he she is a channel and be like what about their ideas in the same way you
can do it with cinema sins but the fact that tiaro is stated it's like if it's a joke you are not
allowed to take it a series it's like well then why are you taking them so seriously on this quinton
like cool guy but uh yeah i the how it should have ended for the last jedi is actually quite
fun i recommend it anybody in chat who hasn't seen it you'd find it by typing in hi uh s he
the last jedi you'll get a few laughs out of it i mean in the first stream that you and i did
on our channel we just started brainstorming about stuff and we came up with a better
last jedi than the last jedi was and we just sat down off the cuff and we came up with something
better that because it would have been so funny turning around to see the audience reaction
and just hearing people go god why they getting so close to his face yeah i don't want to be close
to it i want to be further away it's making me uncomfortable with obstacles in the way
who's that in his video mauler states that they should have taken this opportunity and they could
have explained it saying how snoke was connected to palpatine did snoke rise to power once palpatine
was defeated was he trained by palpatine was palpatine trained by him and the thing is that
despite the fact that they're interpreted as sequels the sequel trilogy is heavily standalone
despite what despite the fact that they're sequels they're not sequels
but but quinton man but i don't even i don't even know what to say to that oh he's amazing he'll do
anything i don't even i don't even know what to say that this fucking lol cow i don't know what
to even say despite the fact there's sequels they're not sequels they are as if the empire
strikes back and return to the jedi also stand alone you're twat it doesn't mean they're not
sequels they're standalone by definition of being fucking movies oh what insanity and the idea that
he's talking about how they stand alone when the force awakens basically says everything will be
explained sorry not here though yeah that's standalone what insanity what have you drank
what have you what have you done to yourself quinton you're not making sense fucking shit
and the thing is that despite the fact that they're interpreted as sequels the sequel trilogy
is interpreted as sequels people usually get over that they're interpretive as sequels
it's like episode one two three four five six seven eight nine that part of it is irrelevant
they're interpreted yeah just because it's episode seven and then it's episode eight
you might interpret that as a sequel i can't with the same characters that occur chronologically
after the previous one like the tro did you watch this when you like put this together and you just
thought yeah that makes sense interpreted as sequels yeah no shit the movie without having
rewatched all six of the original movies alongside the holiday special so to say that the movie needs
to stop and pander to and reference the uh so to explain your own stakes and to connect yourself
with the previous film that is to pander yeah what's this about pandering well because he has
to just fucking de-legitimize us at any any point he can frame it in the most dishonest and inaccurate
way possible so just said uh language episode two of game of thrones is separate from episode one if
you think about it each episode is standalone they're not a sequel quid to this separate episodes
they just happen to occur in the same universe or the same characters chronologically directly
following you have any characters any representation of the past history any any lore or
story or anything in episode two of game of thrones would be to pander to the people who
liked episode one that's it wow this makes no fucking sense at all could you imagine trying to
write with these standards you should be like i'm just gonna vomit on the page and see what people
think it's like and so is like it's like if the next movie starts off with them leaving crate
is that pandering does you know what numbers are like when you have one the next one is two
the next one is three you don't go one seven eight sixteen that you could you could interpret it that
way just because the numbers come after each other they don't actually have any relevance to each
other whatsoever someone's somebody chap pompadour pug said um he's right i always read random
issues of comics because they're always standalone issues christ the original trilogy doesn't make
any sense because most of the audience or at least like half of the audience are you fucking
going to know what you're talking about do you think like all these people who first of all i
have no idea how you arrived at these numbers no but how the fuck do you would you even think
that all of these star wars fans who go in and watch star wars movies just don't know anything
about star wars i love as well by the way that he's appealing to the idea that we shouldn't
account for the previous films because most people will have forgotten them like well what
what what is the point of having any content in them if you're going to assume that no one will
remember it when you make a sequel what the fuck is the point here you have star trek episodes
that harken back to previous star trek episodes from different series do you think when they're
true to their own story and lore they take that into account that yeah not everybody is going to
remember this character from this episode of this season of this show that aired 10 years ago but
it's still part of the lore and we have to be faithful to it harry potter the deathly hallows
part two standard load film doesn't make any sense because most of the audience or at least
like half of the audience isn't going to know what you're talking about half the people who
went to see this movie they don't know key details of the movies that came before that again is no
no metric there he's just like yeah i'm pretty sure this is how half of the universe feels about
this at least half a nice even benchmark exact number that's easy for you to grasp at least half
now it's not even like most or anything these new characters they're like they must they must
have come from before i mean ray herself wasn't there for the original trilogy so how would there
be a scene of their of them discussing a big reveal involving the plot of you're asking me how
do we get snoke's history through to the audience without characters that know who snoke is when
we've got kylo ren are you fucking kidding man if only there was a way for audiences to discover
things along with characters in the yeah only there was a way what you're witnessing here folks
is quinton trying to wrap his brain around the idea that we learn about anything to do with star
wars from any source other than ray he doesn't understand that that's possible this is a picture
of quinton trying to wrap his little brain around extremely simple writing concepts that have
literally existed for hundreds of years god forbid like why would ray talk about snoke she doesn't
even know snoke is so stupid that we suggest getting a history of a snoke must they must have
come from before i mean ray herself wasn't there for the original trilogy so how would there be a
scene of their of them discussing a big reveal involving the plot of the original trilogy
actually she wasn't there and she doesn't know what the hell they're talking about how they're
she doesn't have to wait when did we say that ray has to be the one that does it
yeah what is he talking about why is he fighting the jelly mad again
ray can be used as the conduit for the reason why it's being explained
just like harry potter is a his grown up he's he grows up as a muggle and in the same way the
audience learns about the wizarding world through harry who was learning about the wizarding world
it's just it's this most it's just such a basic concept of writing like literally the
you go back to the oldest epic in history right the epic of gilgamesh and you have fucking
gilgamesh and inkadoo learning about shit also the the what he said makes sense if you showed
a clip of me and rag saying snoke's history should have been dictated by ray but you know
what you're never going to catch us saying that in earnest because there's no reason for us to say
that it would have been appropriate for ray to ask like who are you where did you come from how
come we didn't know anything about you like it just makes fucking obvious sense
and besides um uh luke knows about the prequels in the last jedi he's read about them so it's
completely fair for him to have explained who darth plagus was if that was the case
and he's not even from the prequel trilogy you know what i'm trying to say here is like there's
so many ways you can write it and you're just like no no way nope nope nope nope even though
as someone point out in chat as well anakin turns up in episode six of the ot if you remember in the
remastered version so it's like uh oh maybe these films are connected and they're not stand alone
oh no oh no it could be interpreted that episode six is a sequel to episode five you can interpret
that episode six is the sixth episode look that's up to you to interpret i'll stop and be like uh
paul patine was was my cousin actually isn't that a big reveal i hg then i mean no yeah that would
have been something he just goes like the worst possible delivery to make it sound like it's bad
you could have off the palpatine and snoke exist together and they are aware of each other
but they have different views of the force or they have different views on how to govern a
system or what to do so snoke breaks off from the empire and goes out into a sector of space with
the first order or whatever you just all you got to do is just think about it for a little bit
brainstorm come up with ideas right yeah you know you just sit down and think about it what do you
know you know he's talking about how great it is that snoke was just killed like randomly um the
execution of the scene itself's like i i quite like it enough i think it's neat but what if what
if some character said uh it was snoke and then kyla goes oh he's dead i killed him like that's
the same idea but executed horribly we could do it to you quinton you know you can you can take our
our preference or idea or you know we haven't even said we want it to be darth plague as we're saying
that it could be you know and see what we do with that and then he's like oh yeah they'll just go
oh he's my cousin lol and that's the scene and it's like yeah that would be shit because
why would anyone write it like that why would we have snoke go hey kylo my cousin's plague us by
the way or i am plague as lol someone in chat shadow asks did quinton forget that ray lived
in a rundown atat walk did he forget that she lives on the planet that had the last battle between
the galactic empire and the the movie yeah not for the movies tell us that no no of course but
it's just as far as the movies are considered they want us to know that that's what yeah that's the
the con that's why there's an atat there is what i'm saying yeah godman says snoke's history should
have been dictated by the theme of the standalone sequel to the jar jarbings movie i agree i can get
behind that absolutely behind that and there will be standalone you know that's why it's good and
ask following this stating that abrams had no idea what these reveals were going to be
and it's since been revealed that he had no plan for what the reveals were even going to be from
the yeah well that's not true because it's since been revealed that he apparently had a bunch of
plans that were given to ryan johnson and ryan johnson through the imagine editing this and
forgetting that cant has an apostrophe in it not to mention dude uh the infamous do you remember
how this went like a lot of people were like wow they threw jj from ideas out and then ryan
johnson made a tweet where he said that um he had no he had no such thing from uh thinking he had no
guidelines to work with and people were like oh so jj was kind of a hack fraud he he just he just
had set up with no payoffs and then fast forward probably after this video was made uh daisy
ridley said in an interview that uh ryan johnson had a bunch of notes from jj about all the way
the story threads are going to go and he threw them out yeah and if if we're taking people's
words for it i'm i'm probably going to believe daisy i find it very hard to believe that jj
created all of these setups with no idea where they were yeah but the fact that he spent all
this time and effort and he just literally stopped all of his ideas and stopped writing
everything down about characters for the last scene of this movie was like no there's no way i
this that's hard for me to believe and it's hard for me on top of all those arguments and the pieces
of evidence finally i hate everything what are you trying to say oh it's okay that the last jedi
doesn't make any sense because the force awakens didn't have any guidelines it's like you telling
me no writer could make developments of setups yeah that's the thing even if that was true let's
assume that's true it's no excuse and besides it's like you're supposed to be arguing for the
quality of the last jedi not the fucking yeah i'm not making excuses for how shit it was
get go rags then just denies it and says that it can't be true bullshit he definitely had
he absolutely had ideas there is no way that jj abrams never thought or had ideas about
where the story would go yeah but they're gonna get pedantic on you and say what are you inside
his head rags do you know for unfathomable doubt do you have proof do you have statements
this is some bull this is the whole thing this bullshit about absolute certainty gets my panties
in a knot the idea that you create this entire story and you just have no you're like hey jj
what's what's this no guy and you're like no idea just throw him in okay no clue and he just wipes
his hands and walks away um and by the way uh if we want definitive evidence on the dvd commentary
um jj talks about how they've written the entire history for kylo and snoke and they didn't evolve
it in the movie uh because but this is in the actors heads and so they're aware of what the
history is and it's going to be a point in my series and i'm just like why the fuck couldn't
you share it with the audience so uh he definitely and this is the thing what you said is so very uh
let's say inoffensive he had ideas don't pretend like he didn't and then they're like you couldn't
know this rags you couldn't possibly know this are you gonna it's like it's ridiculous and now
it's been proven that i was right so fuck you i was right fuck you i was right the truth is that
i researched the article myself and it appears that the article about yep it came right from
ryan johnson who lied if we believe daisy ridley yeah hashtag believe women there was no mapped
story presented beyond tfa you know what that's probably true in that there was no story like
there was no script i'm just going to create all these characters and write their interactions
with other people and stuff but oh i don't have any idea where it might go like think of it um
if if if jj said yes snoke is plagueless plagueous uh raised parents uh ob one canobie and someone
else and a bunch of other things and then ryan johnson's like i don't like any of those ideas
and then someone goes so did he provide you any story map out and he goes no you give me a bunch
of ideas on where the things could go but he never gave me a mapped out story it's like how ridiculous
to actually think that jj had no idea where to go that's just that's just embarrassing though
because it's just like oh i'm sorry tiaro you made this video before new information came out that
rags was actually right on this like definitively so it says that ryan didn't receive any material
no it doesn't say he didn't receive any material says he didn't receive a mapped out story there
was no mapped story presented so even if jj had plans they never made it to ryan's yes they did so
this is something that i can neither confirm or deny then we have a very weird point about jj
saving face for the company but hey you gotta save face for the company i totally understand
i mean yeah ryan johnson's actively it's pretty dishonest to say that there was like nothing he
was given after i mean chuck windig just got fired for exactly that yes uh you know and there's
a lot of things ryan johnson says that are just like downright like oh he's so fucking annoying
insane like there's no fair criticisms of the last jedi he hasn't heard any nope
he's a prick who made a shitty movie get over it and i get it once again i do not know where
that has come from i do not see reasonable evidence that abrams of all people is in a
silence the burden of proof lies with ranks on such i i guess we know that's
true because daisy has said that and jj has not said anything on the subject
all right so if i was to try how how could i possibly prove that how could i possibly get into
the mind of jj abrams is like let let i just talking to one from one person to another
right are you actually going to deny the fact that jj abrams did not have any idea as to where his
story or characters might go like is is that actually do you think that is a reasonable thing
to think yes i can't prove it with absolute certainty but i think that it would be crazy
of somebody to say that he had no ideas they wouldn't be theories or they wouldn't they
wouldn't be ideas about what's going on in production like a secret if they were public
knowledge you wouldn't be able to say i you know like the the disney have told uh luke to shut up
or that um jj stayed silent on this subject you wouldn't be able to say these things unless they
you know like people would know them as true or there would be things that you could guess that
would explain the situation like of course uh the disney didn't come out and say we silenced mark
like how that would just be the stupidest thing they could ever do so like what i'm trying to say
is like he's like you don't know these things for sure it's like how would we know them for sure
when the whole premise is that the things that are meant to be kept secret someone said rags the
birth of proof is on you to prove god isn't real like i understand what he's saying yes i am making
the claim that he had ideas because i think that first there's no way to prove it there there is no
way to prove it even if he said so he could be lying that's the thing this is one of those
like unfalsifiable things we'd have to see a weird document with the ideas saved in 2015 i guess i
mean it's just there's no way i could but i would hope that the person that i'm talking with is
reasonable enough to agree with me that the person who wrote these characters out
and establish them in a universe and had them interacting with other characters and then had
the actors and filmed it and went through all that editing process and spend all this time and effort
to create these characters to think that he didn't have any ideas as to where they would go
i think it is absolutely preposterous and i think itself it should be considered self-evidently
retarded i want to read this one out because i think you'll find it interesting rags uh from from
kevin andrew's photo you guys are so embarrassing doing these weekly critiques of anyone with a
different opinion not even producing a rebuttal video just ganging up and nitpicking these
opinions frame by frame this is a rebuttal video uh so well hang on first of all this is a video
from tro and quinton against rags so if anything they teamed up on him first uh secondly we've
rebuddled everything that we can what do you think we're doing if not responding to points
like yeah we've absolutely thrown insults but you can't say that that's anything more than about
two percent of our video that we're making right now and i and maybe he doesn't maybe maybe you
don't make content other than crappy youtube comments so you don't know what time and effort
and works going work goes into a video and when we take a video like look man they made a two hour
video if we were to make like a normal video about their two hour video holy fucking shit
yeah like i don't know what you expect like uh i don't really do anything else what do you want us
to do play the entire video and then say we disagree would that be fair yeah man i mean i
think we're being very fair doing this live then the fundamental uh ending of this response to this
comment in the chat is what do you think tro and quinton did if not what you're accusing us of
doing yes someone said now every time i hear the argument there is no way to prove if this is real
or false i immediately remember mundane matt you know and and matt dilla hunty too because he he's
he's in a he's a skeptic uh an atheist debate guy it's just at this point we just have to do
assume that daisy ridley was lying that's the only thing we got left now because she said it
he's like we have two people saying different things right i have more reason to believe that
ryan johnson i'm not saying it with absolute certainty i'm saying that i believe it and i'm
saying that it's probably true based off of how people work right i think it is far more likely
based off of jj abrams right that he of course had an idea as to where his characters might go
of course because all he has to all he has he just needs the idea like you tell me he never
thought of it he never once considered well i wonder what happens to snoke well he does that
he's from here oh he does this and he does that and kylo oh well he's from here and he doesn't
yeah but you don't know if showy didn't get inside his head rex you're wrong wrong wrong wrong
you know uh the the defense is an opinion or it's hyperbolic or it's a joke or it's uh sentimental
all the all that shit once again never mind all that and and to say the wind nitpicking
tro by the way it's like how is he not being pedantic with the shit that rag says
i just don't understand this like double standard and of course i i hate to say this but like if
you really don't like the way we're doing this um you don't have to watch us do it
you know it's up to you like uh i i this has been the premise of efap since the beginning so
someone says i feel like rags is wrong here jj abrams is notorious for creating mysteries with
zero plans for what their reveals would be i'm sure he had ideas for where these characters came
from oh but oh you say he's here he had ideas from where these characters came from but going no
bullshit i mean if he's got ideas ideas from where they came from then shouldn't where they're
going be defined by whatever their motivation is his ability to portray those in a satisfying way
is completely detached from whether or not he had ideas yeah i i think i just think it's ridiculous
for someone for a director i'm just confused we have daisy ridley's testimony though
we have daisy ridley's testimony doesn't that just end this conversation
she said that like like i'll just find the actual quote for the sake of uh the argument
daisy ridley jj script tfa ryan that should probably do it um there you go
oh jj abrams wrote drafts for star wars eight and nine says daily daisy ridley um
daisy ridley worked with him longer than ryan johnson did remember daisy was with him for his
movie yeah so this is the quote from daisy ridley here's what i think i know jj wrote episode uh
seven as well as drafts for episode eight and nine then ryan johnson arrived and wrote tlj
entirely i believe there's some sort of general consensus on the main lines of the trilogy
but apart from that every director writes and realizes his film in his own way
so there you go daisy really could be lying but that seems like a really odd thing and again
this is just word you know well yeah i guess we'll have to wait here but ryan and daisy to have an
argument with each other that's all we got left anyway i don't know man it just i mean this is i
mean we're probably spending too much time on this point but i think the idea that he didn't have
any idea as to where his characters would go is ridiculous well i mean this point would be over if
i like i said i'm just confused that the daisy ridley thing isn't enough but we also got
the accusation of nitpicking which i mean oh no we're finished as we said earlier as well
we're not even 100 sure of what an individual person means by nitpicking is what we said
invalid or is it just irrelevant or something else who knows how's that tweet doing you put out by
the way oh let me check do let me go to click on my face okay 140 comments
um pointing out something that doesn't destroy the product um someone disagrees i personally
think nitpicking is analyzing little mistakes that can or be present but can affect the overall
product um intentionally going after minor unimportant details usually when someone can't
find any legitimate criticisms of um uh nitpick is something that can easily be overlooked as it
isn't paramount to a product or a service not to dismiss or downplay their flaw but it is something
that i can reasonably accept it's still like an observation as a flaw um a flaw that doesn't
affect the overall plot that is a minor error valid in a sense but not as important like actual
problems or plot holes um uh a nit is a young louse uh it comes from picking nits off of someone one
by one so here you go um that's uh you can pick my nits any days like yeah it's uh it's half
dependent on what people even mean by it before we can even respond to it that's why it's uh it
takes a while sometimes it picks a strong word i prefer extreme attention to detail
small um a lot of people are comparing the pics to the bigger picture
um nick mick to me is pointing out minor details that don't make the final product
any less great however i don't feel like it is valid um making a big deal of time detail
or tiny details pointing out something small that doesn't affect the overall movie
so criticism that although valid does not itself cause a massive issue
that's kind of how i i see it general consensus it's like you've pointed out something that is
you know contradictive or inaccurate or whatever but it didn't really affect anything anyway
um so anyway she says there's a side plot in like a casino which most people agree is a bit clumsy
and takes up far too much time in an already long movie rags then concurs and says yeah that was a
train wreck of a subplot they would have been far better ditching it and spending that time on
something far far more valuable like you know the events that happened between episode four and
episode seven now this one principle isn't a bad point although it could be argued that 11 minutes
of a film would have been hard to fill with exposition no uh the entire history of lord of
the rings to set up the film is done in i think eight minutes at the beginning of the film
yeah man 11 minutes is a long time you can get a lot done in 11 minutes yes you can
but you design although it definitely could have spent it even if they would have spent
11 minutes on how luke became luke yeah that would have been nice instead they chose to have
one flashback three times that change slightly to dictate whether or not he was malicious or
whether or not he was confused we've been filled with something more worthwhile this is something
that i actually subsequently brings up really isn't that bad and it's actually quite a short
segment of the movie doesn't matter 11 minutes is like oh we could ignore the 11 minutes of crap
can't we it's like i hate everything that is uh not a fun argument to be making for the quality
of the film i'm just saying that it's only seven percent of the entire movie um that's a lot that's
11 minutes i mean yeah there's no denying this you could you could you could do a lot in 11 minutes
movie comparatively to the rest of it and rank strangely responds by saying that so who cares
if it's only seven percent of the movie that's a lot not really from my point of view i don't know
about other people but to me 11 minutes is not much no well okay so what we're going to do define
whether or not a lot or a little is what they are they're playing with weasel words here a lot a
little i mean it's let's let's make it simple you said that you could use it for exposition he said
that's not much time to do it the lord of rings does it in less time so it is a lot in comparison
to what a movie can have for exposition done and done we can move on exposition is jeez of course
you could do a lot more if someone said we're going to take out 11 minutes of the worst part of
a movie and replace it with something else it's like think of all the stuff you could do this
tubers only seven percent of your brain yeah i guess it's context huh like uh i think it's silly
to say that seven percent isn't a lot of a film it's like what does that even mean that we could
just if if there's seven percent of bad we could just ignore it doesn't matter what that actual
seven percent is in and the fact that people thought it was longer than it actually was
i mean even that speaks to speaks to like i dare anybody to sit and stare at a wall for 11 minutes
and not do anything it won't feel very quick let's put it that way better point would have dad who
really liked the last jedi he said that whole scene was pointless he said that whole thing was
less like he's like oh yeah and solar dragon just pointed out the the scene they cut with
luke's reaction to hans death uh you could probably cut that down to about eight seconds
if you really wanted to and it has so much more content in that eight seconds than the 11 minutes
of canto bite i mean you i mean you could you could really fuck up a movie in just a couple
seconds oh yes i've been to stated how the scenes themselves totally cut apart important interaction
between luke and ray so the 11 minutes had more impact than originally let on i h e then says
there's cheesy and awkward dialogue at points but star wars has always had that so that's not
really a deal breaker for me i was going into tashi station to pick up some power converters
why is that goofy line why is that goofy he was going to go to the tashi station to pick
up power converters it's like uh goofy and uh again do we even bother mentioning the whole
whataboutism is like it's goofy lines in the other one so it's not goofy oh wait i guess
it's still is goofy oh fuck it doesn't matter oh yeah also is as your mother said uh psa seven
percent of a large number is also large very correct very true um i need to use the luke
so i'll be right back fair enough i will actually get around to reading some super chest because i
haven't done that at all this time around uh npc checking in is that how it works lol i've heard
of the npc meme i'm not 100 up to speed on it just yet uh darth armu um change the chat to live at
defaults to top chat uh oh all messages available some messages such as potential spam may not be
visible oh i would prefer the if my mods knock out any messages that they stay knocked out that's the
job um what's the beef with quinton reviews hopefully that's answered by this video is this
going to be rags or more i love both you lads i'll give you more but i'm broke that is absolutely
fine lord odin 10 euros is actually quite a lot as well so thank you very much and we always
appreciate just watching anyway um talking with us about all of it any opinion on the treatment
of legends in my opinion it's almost an insult to fans when you make good writing stories and
characters non-canonical and replace them with elements replace them and elements with such poor
counterfeits um i don't know enough about legends but i know that very many people are very pissed
off with it and at first it's like if you have something good replace the good thing then it's
okay-ish it's not exactly preferable but if you have something awful replace the good it's like
oh uh is it bad that i want a michael bay star wars i would watch it why not right give it a shot
um in my opinion sucks if you want gundam watch either war in the pocket the eighth ms team or
gundam the origin very well ibo sucks i'm assuming that was supposed to be sorry uh do you believe
some criticisms can be nitpicks absolutely my definition of a nitpick is something that's
valid but mostly irrelevant uh obviously it seems to change between people and i'm not sure if there's
a defined definition of it on you know whatever dictionary um rnm confirmed for self-aware putin
bots dun dun dun me and me and zorags are are rations not trust our opinions on things because
we're simply trying to overthrow america uh i still don't uh i still don't understand how people
can defend this heaping dumpster fire tlj was honestly worse than skyscraper rampage the mag
drastic worldfall and kingdom and somehow even justice league i prefer all of those films over
it so mula how dare you not look like a skull on wheels unsubscribes in futile rage i am so sorry
but like we said you can treat it as a hood ornament that would be on the front of the car
rag's red rocket is ready the virgin quentin versus the chad jeremy who'd be jeremy in that uh
uh jeremy's the name of the guy on cinema sins if that's that's what you go for i like the new
avatar mula just rewatched your infinity wall video it convinced me to see the movie i'm loving
this epic writer response thesis of course it's it's it's wonderful to have reader response
response response theory i'll say again if a script don't matter then a video of just staring
at a wall for now would make me just uh do as much as a video a film of infinity wall it's like yeah
we know there's a difference they like to pretend that there isn't one
um if my opinion was socialism works without knowledge of any prior events or arguments then
that's my opinion any objectively wrong one uh yes i think um i thought art was supposed to be
subjective uh i was taught when two people look at a work of art they get different things out
of it subjectivity is important but only to explain enjoyment i mean well that's the thing
me and me and rags are okay with subjectivity absolutely tell us what tell us what it made you
feel yeah we well i'm assuming rags does but like i use it in my videos when i want to tell
you how i felt about something yeah fine um just know which is which don't cross your wires they
are all warp practitioners and need the stake oh my luke no hobo will you be chris nolan for ob1
movie spiel big cameron and ramey for episode nine not the queer star trek guy i say open it
up to everybody just do it just do it um mola please google open it up please google coming
soon episode nine improv the first second paragraphs in the article is cack they feel
like they're on any under any pressure so improv yeah i've heard about the episode nine is
apparently gonna have a lot of improv which is like oh no i guess well for ghostbusters
yeah it's just like oh please please don't ruin everything um i mean they've already done that
but you know you've ruined it more uh in the eu or legacy force ghost can affect the physical
world to a limited degree however it's mostly the sith shown doing so as it goes against the jedi to
abuse the power for self-serving means and that's the thing uh you could have made that rule we
could have talked about it in the films but we don't have anything to go off and it's just like
he fucking burns down the jedi temple it's like oh my yoda you you got some uh you could you could
do a lot of shit there why don't why don't you try that on you know anything that could help the good
guys um i hate rags too i mean i really don't know him but hashtag i hate everything so it's k
right yeah yeah it totally makes sense also i squeaked like hell then my throat is getting very
i wasn't gonna say anything but it's not cute a penny for each time quinton is a hypocrite well
that'd be wonderful i could retire uh in revenge of the sith yoda sends obi one to master a new
ability retaining as a ghost because old friend returned qui gone but that's just the law
yeah that explains why there's no force ghosts in the prequels so george lucas clearly gave a shit
sort of i um if i had if i got zero pennies every time quinton contradicted himself i feel like i
still be rich somehow you just feel like money that's worth nothing but you have so much of it
you just sell it for scrap and it turns out to get you billions it's like this video so much nothing
um all did you feel like rugby football cricket uh do you like them if so do you support um i only
ever really watched rugby and it was support in wales and i've not seen the new dr who am i right
man and doge let's get to brass tacks layer spacewalk was dumb and stupid lightning jumping
pushing choking and force blasts are pretty cool the prequels an expanded universe of cool powers
i mean yeah genuinely subjectively i like seeing force powers that are neat but seeing her fly
through space i was like oh my that's that's awkward like even if it was 100 fine with uh
what we know about the force and we've seen her do it before i'd still be like oh man so awkward
please stop i love you guys we're an hour and four minutes into this and i can't listen to
him anymore even though the filter of you guys have some money thank you brendan follow up from
last week's super chat that i left neo is awesome i recommend it and feel free to use this money
towards your steam purchase of it i do have it thanks to uh no bullshit actually bought me it
i am gonna get around to playing it i swear to god one day uh
timestamp for you boys in the rags video is 1 10 30 yeah we've definitely um
i'll go down in the history books now like unfortunately for quinta the editor add tiaro
actually in episode three is it strongly implied that the force ghosts are not the normal become
with the one with the force thing yeah it's some kind of like special ability you learn according
to yoda at least i think uh press y if quinton's law doesn't matter that's with a y as can be
from i think rags oh have either of you seen bad times at el royale yet if not i'd recommend you
take this money and watch it i have not hit it admit you like hodl's beard because hodl hodl's
awesome he should have uh he should have done the hyperspace kamikaze this music freaking sucks
i mean yeah i would have recommended different music or just not to hold oh not music at all
uh quinton ain't quitting bullshit all i have shackles my good man rags sit on my face
i mean yay there you go that's just something for both of us hey nerd sad wolf ain't here but it's
been a good stream so far quinton's a dipshit fat ass well wolf will full return don't panic
about that and obviously wolf i think said he'd seen this video and he was just like annoyed by
it so i guess like there's a good chance where he would have just been not really wanting to
comment on it anyway but me and rags are fucking tearing this apart with these like uh we're
masochists in a way that he isn't yeah well besides i don't know if you guys have heard
but eric taxon's made a video against wolf so when wolf finally gets around to um wanting to
you know come back on efap that's probably the first thing we'll cover forced diversity maul and
rags keep the good work love you guys for someone who wants to get into dark souls one is the steam
dark souls remastered a faithful port to play or do i need this ps3 copy thanks from what i know
the remaster is decent it's just that um it wasn't a big enough difference from the modded
version of dark souls at a base so if it's your first experience go for it uh but i would
recommend checking out some videos sort of reviewing it just to make sure yeah there might
there might be some charm in playing the original you know movie bulb or quinton who's the biggest
piece of shit quinton uh i would say well damage to us personally it's obviously quinton but
quinton's more personal but overall movie bob's like movie bob's just a horrible person yeah i
was gonna say movie bob probably does more damage in general like damage to humanity versus damage
to us here's the thing if movie bob had the infinity gauntlet like people would die yeah
which is it's not reassuring like very seriously like people would die in regards to star wars
letters it was like i was taking a nice hot bath and they replaced it with cold shit so many stories
and games gone yeah i'm sorry about that and uh it's it's something we just have to sort of accept
the dizzy we're like nodcat and lolololol it's like uh fine because they got to buy the ip guys
that's how that works but thank you all very much for the generous donations and uh let's let's see
where they go next that's saying why do you have such a fucking problem with luke behaving as
someone in his position would exactly do i'm like do you just have a hate boner for luke skywalker's
character like ryan does this then happens again for the next two quotes as well
i thought they smelled bad on the outside
scrappy looking nerf herder i don't know where you get your delusions laser brain so the only
quote out of all of them that i think is goofy is i don't know where you get your delusions from
laser brain like it's the only one where i'm like man layer is that the best you could do
uh yeah but the others they don't seem out of character yeah they all seem to fit to me like
i i would i wish i and everything would be like this is goofy because um instead of just saying
these are goofy as hell it's like i thought they smelled bad on the outside that's something that
anyone would say about anything that aliens if aliens were watching um a film about you know
earthlings and some character said i'm gonna go to the exon station to gas up the honda
like that wouldn't that wouldn't be yeah it's like these humans are goofy
it would just be we just we don't know what these things are it's just like a slice of life
like detail line like he's going he he's gonna go do something yeah it's just it seems like a
weak defense to me it's like look at this now everything's fine in the last jedi okay it's
like oh is that how that works okay yeah it's not my opinion those are goofy it's just subjective
yes they're in character but you'd be hard to push to deny that they are least somewhat corny
the idea of just telling someone they can't win in the midst of a lightsaber battle that they
then it's not about the lightsaber fight yeah it's about the fact that if he dies he becomes
one with the force and there's a force ghost and darth vader doesn't kill him that way it's not
about who wins the lightsaber fight how come you have such a fundamentalist understanding about star
war such a bizarre like he does like if you're talking about just the fact that the lightsaber
balance and him literally dying you saying there's a goofy that he said that despite
die is like he's obviously referring to the fact that he becomes a force ghost
come on lose does have its cornball appeal the latter quotes are not disputed as being corny
so we can continue what what do you mean they're not disputed i'm so maybe he means by you and
your video but like i would dispute the shit out of it rags questions why they're bad but the rest
were appropriate and in character and they built them up with personalities why are these lines
bad but i h e never said they were bad he even put a mini disclaimer oh come on he said they were
goofy it's not exactly a positive claim is it yeah it's like you know rags is taught is saying
that he's criticizing those lines that's what i had everything's doing give him some slack please
just a little bit of slack yeah that's absolutely why it's there like them he just finds them goofy
then i actually references two prequel quotes and states that he would find it ironic if
why would you i think you're gonna say this in your video now everybody but the idea that you
say the dialogue in the sequels isn't so bad look at the dialogue in the freaking prequels
it's like literally the prequels that are memed to death because of how funny the lines are
memes on twitter like how many it's like a reddit to prequel memes and shit
if you criticize the scripting the last jedi but not the prequels no it's because i'm so
in love with you so love is blinded you i'll try spinning that's a good trick
like i find it pretty ironic if you love the prequels but you're cool what
do you can't love them even if they have goofy lines in them i'm confused now
what his point even is you can't if there's a corny line you can't love the film and not only
that ones we're the ones who are accused of saying shit like that you can absolutely love
the prequels and say they have goofy lines i love the prequels they're terrible and i love them
calling out this movie for having bad dialogue rags then references the destiny video as irony oh
we're gonna start talking about irony is that what we're gonna do now besides the defense of
the last jedi that you seem to have is oh yeah but these other movies yeah it's not very compelling
before going on to suggest that the defense of the last jedi consists of referring to other
movies to falsely justify the last jedi's flaws the last jedi had shit writing oh but the prequels
open these movies that were made 40 years ago oh but defend them from the criticism that people
are levying against it don't go to other movies we are not discussing if this was a valid point it
would be legitimate criticism but if we break down ihc's last two main points they were that
firstly he didn't mind the corny dialogue in the last jedi mainly because that has been a recurring
theme in the past films and clearly it's nothing that jolts him he wasn't trying to justify yeah
but rags already said like how are the other ones even goofy so that that wasn't really even by your
definition of what he was trying to prove it wasn't exactly cohesive let's put it that way
fight in this instance he's just stating that they've been used before in films so he didn't
find its inclusion here anything bad for him his second point is that he i'm not sure that
he said that i thought he was just like people who are complaining about goofy dialogue it's
in the ot2 i don't remember him saying like i didn't mind goofy dialogue because um i've always
liked goofy dialogue or something like that again i could be wrong because yeah we've got barely any
context terrible so it's impossible to remember but i think he was using the fact that it was in
other films as a reason why we shouldn't have a problem with it he finds people who complain
about the dialogue here but not in the prequels to be employing double standards now this is
presupposed by the fact that the dialogue in the prequels is pretty corny but that is something
that most people agree on and if we assume that then yes it could be seen as double standards he
never at one point tried to defend the film through this he accepts it and explains why
he personally found it fine some people enjoy corny lines he's not arguing it he's just saying
he found it fine this is the problem there isn't a disagreement just one person idea of placing
pretty sure he said the you can't love the prequels if you say they you don't accept that
they have goofy lines as well or something like that we just covered it you played the clip they
had the anakin clip playing in the spaceship yeah like i i don't want to go back to get the exact
line but i'm pretty sure you said the you know if you claim to love prequels you have to accept
that they have this attitude it's just like that you say that like it's a contradiction
i don't know i didn't need it again but there was definitely someone to disagree with there
it wasn't a hundred percent agreement i don't i don't think so
conducive value on certain components being different to another
i h e states to find a somewhat ham-fisted anti-one percent message kind of funny and
ironic given the context of what star wars represents somehow brags my getter gotcha in
there and i'm certain they are thrilled that you paid to see it three times exactly yeah
yeah you know like he even said it was ironic like yeah rags just filled in the rest of the
gaps there it's like he you have a problem with the anti-capitalist message in a movie that you
paid to see three times it's just like
goes for that sort of level i h e then ask a rhetorical question that sort of level
piece of shit okay all right place in conducive value on certain components being different to
another i h e states to find a somewhat ham-fisted anti-one percent message kind of funny and ironic
given the context of what star wars represents somehow brags my getter gotcha in there and i'm
certain they are thrilled that you paid to see it three times which is almost fine art at this
point i have to give him kudos for that sort of level i h e then ask a rhetorical oh yeah oh boy
there we go i'm confused did i have to give him kudos for that sort of level excellent i take it
back you're not as big of a piece of shit as you were before what does he mean by that sort of
level yes i don't know i i think he's complimenting me on yeah i think he was too i was just confused
by the word he used yeah very very strange but yeah boy cool question yeah treating animals
nicely is important and everything was it really necessary alongside everything else this film was
trying to achieve which rags then answers no it was not the answer is no mauler goes way more in
depth than i do in his criticism the answer is no videos but man they packed a lot of incompetence
into seven percent of this movie's screen time before i h e subsequently answers it anyway which
i do find humor in this is one of the examples that seem to illustrate how sometimes i think
brag seeks to interject a bit too much to the point where you forget the whole sentence and
the point the person may be trying to make i mean that's still better than literally not
having any of the sentences of the videos you can't even see what you're responding to
like obviously i i mean i don't mean literally i mean he's got like 10 of your video in his
video so we can sometimes see what you said this is an excellent example of why my style is better
than well yeah i would take your style over his any day this is the thing that when h bomber guy
said i took a joke of his seriously i was like i played your video so anyone would know that
you know they can go hey why did mauler take that so seriously
yeah people never have to like ask for context in my stuff because it's all there what i could have
done is said uh h bomber guy makes this very serious point and then i re-recant it instead
of showing the clip simple as like that's that's why i prefer this style but he's just like nah
you interject and this is something that can happen me and rags can totally respond to a point
without realizing that the following point is going to contextualize the point they just made
that can happen but like we'll usually try and account for it when we follow on we go oh they
were saying this sorry and that's just you know is that so bad i think that's uh i think that's
a good way of doing it to be honest no not really other than to serve those character arts
rose tico definitely did not have let's see i want to clarify before we respond to that
so did you catch that tro is like rag said no it's not uh uh needed and then i hit everything
literally follows up with saying no it's not needed implying that what you said was redundant
but then i hit everything follows up with well except for the character arcs meaning it's not
something that he thinks shouldn't be in the film at all he thinks it's good for the character
arcs which is now what you're responding to so that was not i didn't even i didn't even
catch that the first time because i just do it as it happens but this is the thing i will outclass
the right opinion on the levels of pedantry i've gone over this before i am extremely pedantic
and so he's like he's pedanticizing you and i just counter pedanticized him if that makes
any sense at all i'm pretty sure i just made up words but it's uh saying i cite the source of my
videos in the description but you never have to watch the original because the originals
basically fully in my video yeah and i like that you do that i genuinely haven't found any other
content creators other than myself who did that before that's why i was like oh this is neat
like uh when i responded to h barber guy people were like it's stupid you put his entire video
and your response i was like but that's the point yeah um and yeah as for the character arcs
i guess fin learns that there are bad people in the universe i don't know what else happens there
um oh man that's oh i have a character arc she should have had her character arced
like part of a trajectory from a trebuchet i don't know i know what a character arc is
you piece of shit wait i didn't see him respond hang on because you just responded so fucking
angrily there i change a journey in the count oh god he's not explaining a character arc is he
is he thinks that i would yeah because i joked about the character arc being like shot out of
a trebuchet and he took you seriously here's what here's what a trebuchet who's what a character
arc actually is like part of a trajectory i don't know yeah i'm walking in there i don't know a
character arc represents a change a journey in the character from hb now if you genuinely dislike
that character arc even if the person ended up worst it's still a change there's a point about
humor with well hang on what change takes place in canter bite anyway what change takes place
in canto bite for any of the characters i'm confused like he said that you can't deny it
because it is a change it's like what change um uh they got older
they literally aged by seven minutes they they they aged good lord like i'm on board with the
idea here i'm like what is the change what happens to these characters what is different
about like maybe uh i guess finn learns that there are bad people in the universe which
shouldn't surprise him because i thought he got his quote-un-quote change but he was on the ship
with the dude remember he has that moment where he just stares and he's like oh my god
i guess but i don't know like what's like a character arc for an eight-year-old
well yeah i think that too i think it's really sad that finn had to have the moment of there
are bad people in universe even though isn't that the whole point in the force awakens that
he's like oh my god the team i'm on is horrible i mean why do you think he left if he didn't know
that there are bad people then why did he leave one side because he thought they were bad and
the really confusing part where the guy explains to him that the good guys and the bad guys get
their weapons from that place so stop thinking that it's just the bad guys so you're like oh
nuance and then go from there finn decides to become a hardcore resistance member you're like
oh okay see someone said uh quite british says rose went from wanting to smash stuff
to actually smashing stuff perfect arc nailed it you nailed it you got it the differences so we'll
skip this bit then there's some exchange over the ports and the minions this is mostly worthless as
it's a side note on ih's video but once again it does demonstrates rags his tendency to interrupt
before ih has completed points ih says at least he fucking shows his points tro yeah
like we just have to take your word that all of that happens i guess whenever you showed context
we basically like fucking rip it apart but then when you just say that a thing happened we just
have to believe you which yeah forgive us for uh deciding against that it's so bizarre because
again i we we were 110 in your video at one point and now we could be anywhere like we
we only know that because we had to go fucking fact check him and quinton that's the only reason
and here's the thing i'm responding to a video exactly yeah like he's he's trying to you if you
play full context it doesn't even matter if you fucking get something wrong because it was there
the audience can see it i don't know maybe i don't know what he's saying here about the
fucking porgs remember when we we thought that he said flood analysis or something and people were
like oh you meant flawed analysis like we showed it so people know that we were wrong on that we
misheard this is the benefit of responding in real time people can see where we we can make
mistakes yeah and the fact that you know as being pointed out in chat the fact he doesn't play my
video chronologically is odd i don't know why he thinks that's the good way of doing this skipped
around and we know that he has deliberately had me taken out of context blood thesis
as the porgs and minions aren't the same so side note i don't think comparing the porgs
to minions is fair in terms of how they actually affect the movie oh god i remember this he says
that uh minions are worse because they actually have a purpose remember this um play keep playing
despicable me movies the porgs really don't affect anything they're just birds rags interrupts makes
a comment adds that they're only there to sell toys well yeah exactly they're useless they don't
surface the plot in any way they're meant to sell plushies to small children but do you not agree
that things are more meaningful when they have a direct influence on the plot he lets ihg continue
who then compares ewoks if anything ewoks are comparable to minions because they're only framing
that like you were doing something negative like that sounded like you yeah that sounded coherent
to me impact on the plot of the movie rags and interjects again adding the sell toy comment uh
yes porgs are just there to sell toys once more before ihg completes the sentence referencing
that they're there to sell toys well i'm saying that they're a toy yeah yeah what's wrong with
that what's the problem yeah that may be true certainly but again they had an effect on the
that makes sense tro rags he says the thing about the the penguin assholes he's like yeah
they just say they sell toys then he's like minions aren't and you're like well it's just
like oh yeah but the ewoks is like again they're more than just selling toys and then the other
thing he's like and they sell toys and you're like yes that's that's that's what we all understand
it's the here's the thing it's the porgs lack any reason beyond selling toys yeah i don't
is like he says a thing and i respond to it and i would have said the if i had taken everything
he said and then put everything i said afterwards it wouldn't have changed the thing i don't understand
where his problem is with that um yeah not to mention you know like the difference like i guess
we have to explain this because otherwise people might not understand so you have luke skywalker
fighting vader for example and then someone goes man i want to make some toys of that and they do
and they sell and then someone else goes hmm maybe we should make stuff that can simultaneously
be a part of the plot and sell toys and then ewoks happen and then they go hmm okay maybe we just
make stuff that can be made into toys who cares about the plot fuck it fucking and then porgs
were invented now which of those three would be the most substantive in terms of content i wonder
like what are the ones that actually matter to the script the most versus the ones that were just
created to be toys and that's what rags's point is in case what's missed and as being said in the
chat master clockwork says what the fuck does he keep bringing up or why the fuck does he keep
bringing up rags is interjecting a response video yeah and he does it as if you've ignored or
left things out which you don't you play the stuff as it goes and it's like there and do you
want to know who does take things out this is just a chaos zig says tro has admitted rags saw
the whole video then keeps acting like rags hasn't seen the video yet yeah the why is rags mad about
furry representation for the story forward amongst this rags also posed the question that would i
actually not agree that something is more meaningful when it is integral to the plot but do you not
agree that things are more meaningful when they have a direct influence on the plot i don't know
how i actually would respond to this unless he made a video response which he won't but i'm sure
he does agree that something is more meaningful to the well that boy you think he'd agree
which means that rags was valid in this entire sequence right hooray plots when it has a direct
effect what an amazing take down of me otherwise as he said it's just a side note he wasn't trying
to state otherwise it was just a side note i'm pretty sure i ate everything's point was that
minions are worse because they affect the plot and rags has said wouldn't it be better if they
affect the plot and then you said yeah he probably would agree but that's not what his point was
what what what what what what not following we're having a miniatures in i'm almost at the end of
what i'm gonna put up with here it's scary on reference per video is a running joke on this
channel something that i didn't even notice until a few videos ago although i get it as i assume
uninterrupted content over a certain mark might be automatically claimed and the tv were to skip
over a certain part some people would accuse him of missing points it just seems sometimes the
interruptions unnecessary we've already been over how it's valid so you're wrong on this yeah it's
valid it doesn't matter i make points that he doesn't agree with are necessary and excessive
the idea that a star wars film can be said to be objectively without value what what what
why come back to rewind rewind the tape we come back to quinnton what do we get immediately
something we never fucking said i've got to hear that again go back a little bit one two seven
let's go to five oh one twenty seven yeah one twenty seven fifty actively i gotta go back in
further awkward with this timeline one two seven it's a long video one two seven there that should
do it excessive the idea that a star wars film can be said to be objectively without value
because it's sold toys how little do you have to know about the history of star wars film what
the fuck who fucking said that quidditch who fucking said that where did you get this
what is wrong with you it's like you're just talking to yourself and you don't even know i'm
here what are you doing quinton this is not like remotely respectable you just implied that me and
rag said star wars the last jedi is without value because they're selling toys with it what the fuck
are you talking about what jesus christ like this is insane this is the jelly man is back it's the
stroll bad that just destroys itself so stupid the dough would have said it how do you i don't
know how you can so consistently argue against points that aren't made and just make shit up
is that what you took away from what i said just like in what universe
he's just making shit up yes well you're just making shit up wow what a joke of a
film and the toy industry to know that the franchise has only been so amazingly successful
and bombastic because of the existence of companies like kenner i went to the museum
of moving image a few weeks ago and shiny means society was a lot of fun and there's a whole like
chunk of the museum where they're just showing off star wars toys because it's that important to the
story of how media was congratulations you're beating the shit out of the straw man like you
i agree memorabilia can be important for history i totally agree why the fuck are you spending so
much time on this i'm just glad you got the exercise man yeah just just punch that straw
man beat him up was consumed in the west a star wars movie selling toys does not make it
soulless or capitalistic it just makes it a star wars it makes it capitalistic of course it makes
it capitalistic fucking fucking selling products to a market based on demand of course it makes
it capitalistic i don't think that's wrong no neither do i i'm just like yeah it is what it is
to say it's soulless uh depends depends i think the porgs are soulless
you know i think the crystal the precious crystal fox boys i think they're soulless
citizen kade doesn't have toys yeah you have like a little guy dressed in a suit like my
citizen kade toy the cane from citizen kade i got the parrot from the parrot scene we're missing
something really important here at some point i hate everything off-handedly states that he
liked the kamikaze scene and rags responds by saying we're talking about that it was visually
stunning but it contradicted this oh did you catch that he said that rag said it was visually
stunning didn't he say earlier something along the lines of like the we we said something like
that nothing was stunning in the film or something am i remembering that wrong um i
can't remember but at this point i'm gonna just give you the default point well that he's just
like this is interesting segue though no yeah that's true it's like oh we're gonna talk about
the hyperspace jump now is that oh okay well that's the thing this there's no structure in this it's
like rags this film does not have zero value because it sells toys now back to the hyperspace
you think wait what so now that that straw man's fucked up now let's move on to the next one
really important here at some point i hate everything off-handedly states that he liked
the kamikaze scene and rags responds by saying it was visually stunning but it contradicted the
star wars lore yep the hyperspace kamikaze was visually stunning but it made absolutely no sense
in the star wars universe so you're left going wait explain that point how does it contradict
the star wars lore because the way i wanted to be fucking doing it all the time you stupid idiot
yeah and the counter arguments are so weak like it's so fucking self-evident to like a normal
person like even my dad like i told this to my dad my dad who loved the last jedi and i said why
haven't they always been doing this my dad said just don't think about it like his he was one of
those like just dismiss it don't worry about it just you know it was really cool scene it was
really awesome yeah it looked really really neat and it was really cool in the theater
like he didn't even try and defend it because even that is better than trying to defend a bad
song it's just oh man and i'll give it to you rags like if you don't actually argue why i
wouldn't even blame you because it seems so blatant like isn't it pretty obvious the point
is we would have seen this in the other films that's that's the point we would have seen that
more in this film yeah that's like you don't even have to go to other films all those ships
that just get blown up so why didn't they hyperdrive like they were out of fuel so why didn't they
do at the beginning yeah why didn't they start when they it's like right when we have enough
fuel to do one last hyperspace jump just kamikaze into the planes behind us or the ships behind us
figure out what he was talking about again is going to maulers video finding the same part
and then seeing what he had to say he fucking complaining about the fact that we have to go
and find context no rags is arguing about when all you do is lack context or make lines up from
us i think he's he's gonna try and say that we use very similar wording well he he's saying that
you referenced me apparently so like we have to go to my video to know what your argument is
but yeah your your video was very much uh i learned a great deal from the film based on your
video as many people did so there won't be similarities in the ways that we um similarities
in the way that we express our ideas and and this is what rags meant what i meant no i said
exactly what i meant no no he knows what he meant exactly what i fucking meant he knows what you're
trying to get inside my head why in all seven of the mainline episodes of star wars and rogue one
up to this point have we not seen this kind of maneuver okay first of all why don't more star
wars movies feature scenes of really expensive big ships that they being used to ram into other
ships stupid framing the question like that instantly shows us how little you understand
the concept so i think every word out of your mouth quinton is just detrimental to your position
what he's referencing there i think is in rogue one they disable a star destroyer with i think
it's ion cannons and then they push it with like a hammerhead sort of ship into another
star destroyer and he's saying hey why isn't that in all the other films and my answer to that is
when would it be in contextually useful to do that and when would it have been very specific maneuver
and not just that but like it's dangerous as fuck to do that move to try and push your star destroyer
when you've got tie fighters everywhere like it's not a guarantee at all hyper hyperdrive kamikaze
and besides that's rogue one who said that i think that that isn't a contradiction
yeah and this is what about ism again and here's the thing here so you've got
the the fact that he frames this as that like this is a valuable useful ship obviously they
wouldn't be using valuable useful ships until the time when there was nothing else you could
possibly ever do with it like in the last Jedi they would at the very last second they would
turn them around in hyperspace hyperspace kamikaze they would just take pieces of junk and strap an
engine to them yeah there's so obviously they wouldn't have these very big elaborate useful
ships and then just waste them if their purpose was to come he's gonna this is the other problem
with this rags is that i have i think five counter arguments i present in my own video and they're
all the ones that so like uh this is the first time they've been able to do it uh the ship has
to be that big uh the you know there's loads of counter arguments i bring them all up and i knock
them all down i guarantee you he's not going to reference that at all also someone someone went
back to my original video and said indeed um when i talk about how they don't use force powers in
that fight i am talking about the throne room fight so oh yeah we've got the we've even got
the timestamp for it that's probably the biggest flaw of this entire video because it's just
a blatant malicious lie like you can't get around it it's not it's just it's not a bad argument it's
just malicious it's just taking some mannequin maybe the same reason that all other war movies
do that so sparingly because it's not a bad it's an amazing idea they they destroyed like
eight what i believe it's 11 star destroyers and the supremacy i believe that's the result
for the price of one holy shit that's insane value that is incredible value
and that's just a ship that they were using anyway not to mention all the other use they
and let's not forget rags it's like oh yeah remember in return of the jedi when several
ships that are like the raddest they're called capital ships they're from the mong kalamari i
believe uh at least two of them are blown up by the death star throughout that scene where you'd
be like oh so they probably should have just hyper-drived into the death star then that might
have been a good idea if people could do that but obviously the original trilogy uh ran as if you
could not do that as did the prequels as did rogue one i mean that that's like i think that
quinton is too stupid to understand that if this was a thing that you could do that practically
all of space combat would be focused around this one aspect this one tactic would be the central
point around which every other strategy would be derived everything would be built around
being able to accelerate things to hyperspeed and hitting them into other things and let's
just put it this way quinton so you understand uh destroying a part of your fleet for the entire
enemy fleet that that's uh that's a plus in the book of war that's pretty fucking good so it's
definitely it's the kind of thing we'd be like at this point the first order should be hyperdriving
one of their star destroyers into the raddest they just just empty it out they've got 11
just empty it out hyperspace just a shuttle they just take one of their shuttles like yeah just
hyperspace into the raddest which makes you wonder oh and i never even thought about it the
other way fuck you're right welcome to first order doesn't just take one of the transport ships
put a droid on it as as smud boy as just highlighted by the way it's like why even
why do you have a death star at this point why don't you just create big blocks of cement
and fire them into planets i mean like it just fucks with everything so much and even if jeez
if there's so much wrong with it well once upon a time we could just say it's not a thing you can do
not a thing you can do but now it's like oh it is but there's all these really complicated fan
invented reasons why you can't do it in any other situation i mean the fact that quinton is gonna i
wonder if the right opinion is going to defend it i think you'll leave this to quinton because he
doesn't know star wars very well but we'll see that is so visually stunning so clever and so
obvious it'll be the opposite of clever quinton if it counters its own fucking rules if it was
obvious it wouldn't be clever generally the obvious things aren't considered the clever ones
in terms of the universe that you think to yourself how has no one thought of this before
yeah wait you think it's so clever that it makes sense no one thought of it
to literally hyperdrive into someone why would no one have thought of that before
like do you does quinton not understand that the original functionality of like triremes and shit
is that they're rams you ram them into enemy ships you know it comes across as naive it's
like do you know anything about humanity weaponizing shit is like one of the first
things we do whenever we find a new resource of course they would fucking think of this
incomprehensible how stupid this person is your response is to say this is bad
because if this was possible one of the other we're not saying it isn't possible we have
problems because now apparently it is it both is that isn't like is it like well we assume that
it uh isn't in the other films because they don't do it when they should do it but now we've
established thing and i'm like oh okay then the fact that he's trying to defend this when it's
just oh man and how long has hyperdrive existed dare i even ask lore thousands of years in the
star wars universe it's like did no one try it not even some random dude it is like the war hammer
universe where technology's like at a stagnant point pretty much um and is uh it's just it's
just saying the hills to die on i know oh man of all the hills to die on
their movies would have done this if that's the case then i don't know what to say because then
you should have kept your fucking mouth shut why would you do what to say shut up if you don't
loud mouth would be one of the very i don't know poignant labels for quinton i think through this
video god press your fucking teeth jesus you ever thought of that wow adhom because your standard
for what these movies can do at this point is so limited that just speaks to your imagination
yeah that's really sad quinton that you think that setting up your own rules in your universe means
that you're limited it means you have to be creative to generate new stories just like
do you know the rules of the universe that we are in have been set since the dawn of fucking time
and yet new things keep happening how crazy is that it's insane that he thinks that if you
don't have hyperspace kamikaze you can't have interesting space back well if you remember uh
who made that point i think it was patrick willams he said that um if we don't have holdo
for no reason keeping the information from poe then we don't get an interesting story
that it's like oh god that's your standard for writing it's just inventing the worst reason for
things imaginable or accepting a terrible reason and the idea that this is a critic who
and i think that every critic to some degree probably fancies they can write things to some
degree you know they kind of go hand in hand i would imagine just but this lack of imagination
in this this defeatist attitude yeah that there is no possible way to have done better
it's like would you have said this before rogue one came out and they
fucking used the hammer maneuver and you know it's like see for me right i could i can listen
out to an argument for it i know there's some people who don't like it but when i saw that
hammer maneuver in in rogue one i remember thinking myself like huh i guess that would
work because if you disabled the ship you could then just push it into another one and the the
sheer size of them probably would clash but again if someone was like it shouldn't make
sense because of x y and c i'm willing to hear the argument but as far as i know that does make
sense yeah i i would say it probably makes sense you disable a ship if you can hit it with something
and change its direction then it essentially becomes a huge basically a glorified hammer
a battering ram essentially um but the hyperspace one oh man oh man what a what a hill because we
have to directly copy the first seven movies if star wars failed to reinvent if they failed to
make audio reinvent also known as completely contradict yourself apparently retcon and
reinvent i mean this is grasp onto the universe in new ways if they failed to be to be interesting
and new interesting you have to be contradicted to be interesting now i it's just these insanely
low standards that he sets for writing and again arguing against someone who doesn't exist me and
rags never said that uh you shouldn't reinvent that you shouldn't remain interesting it's like
as if we would ever fucking make these claims it's like no we just owe you to contradict rules
that actually built the stakes in the previous films joe why it was so tension filled to see the
death start blowing everyone up in return of the jedi because we knew they couldn't just hyperspace
into it yeah because it was a threat you couldn't just oh okay i guess well that's that
uh we would not have made it past episode six as if here's the thing he's like i guess
he thinks in his mind that george lucas in his three movies expanded in sorry expended every
single thing that could possibly be done in the entirety of the star wars universe yeah it's not
like it's an enormous world with amazing technology literally nothing else could be depicted or
yeah it's just it's a really sad counter because it's just like just leave it alone it's new leave
it alone it's so fucking defeatist and pathetic fucking disaster just subbing in abmorakbar
would not have solved anything it would have been a pretty damn good start i would have been a good
start yeah yeah yeah i agree rags her character was so useless forced and unnecessary that you
could have swapped her for admiral akbar and nothing would have changed in the story but many
it's not the casting that defines the character is the character themselves what is holo's character
yeah tiaro don't even go there holo doesn't have a character she's a prop she's there to ignore
an obstruction yeah she's there she's there for pose arc if you could even fucking call it that
yeah to be generous and call it an arc which is like an again an arc moving backwards he's worse
off because of this arc yeah don't don't even bother i'm interested to see if he's going to
fucking talk about her character i found most of polder's decisions to be more questionable
rather than who she was so yes agba wouldn't have changed much on a casting basis alone but it also
didn't help the act portraying him had passed away i think whoever was casted no i don't care
about the casting man yes that's not the point it's it's about using someone who's already in
the universe who has the exact same fucking rank and you blew him out the a-log and it's like you
know as much as i'll respect the original voice actor you can you can get an impersonator for
admiral akbar yeah i mean hell they CGI'd in tarkin and leah so i mean leah's voice changes
i mean she's the same actor and her voice changes yeah yeah this is the thing is it's you can do it
and and just be like we've got so if akbar you bring in akbar as rag said that's a start and
then we we involve this idea that he thinks poe might be a mole i know it's unreasonable but
maybe we can make it work after a few redrafts of the script ryan but um no because everything
no there's no possible way everything has been done before you have to do something insane and
bring its purple hair lady otherwise you're not reinventing listen admiral akbar is darth play
just the wise they just blown out the a-log because they were like trust me girl from a
personal point of view especially given the context it's more understandable rags then
makes an alternative scene suggestion it would have made much more sense if they insisted on
keeping that stupid kamikaze maneuver to have admiral akbar be the one to do it himself perhaps
he turns the ship around and he begins to charge up the light speed engines and then the imperial
captain sees it from the deck of the supremacy and he turns around to say it's a trap before
admiral akbar slams through the oh it would have been so good it would have been so wonderful
oh that'd be so good you just shed a tear like oh akbar you you set that trap akbar
oh that was so good because admiral akbar is known for saying that thing but now somebody
else is saying it because of him and that's what we know him for saying it'd be so fucking good
i mean he'd still fucking break the shit out of them i was gonna say you wouldn't you need to go
further than that like but just that but hey at least it would be in service of a fucking character
ship and decimates the enemy fleet which i guess is fine if that's what you want though i think
the it's a trap meme is rather dead at this point it wouldn't be a meme it wouldn't be an actual
thing it would make sense for them to say that because they've been following this ship around
and they're all lined up and i mean to say something he said about you earlier you didn't
even disagree there tro you just said like yeah i mean if that works for you it's like all right
then but even when we agree i get the the worst oh yeah he hates agreeing with you like i guess i
kind of agree with him i ultimately know less about him from the movies than we do lord dern's
character what do we fucking know about lord dern's god i remember this point too so he's saying like
if you look at it right now we know more about a holder than we do about akbar and it's like that
is true but only because of the last jedi where they fucking flushed akbar out the window
and they decided to give her lines of dialogue that's their choice she wasn't that's the thing
if you went with my decision right which is better and disney could have had that one for
free if they asked so we it was an arbitrary decision for them to have holdo exist period
from nowhere and to have him die just so unceremoniously in a borderline off screen so
yeah obviously that wouldn't have even happened if you did my idea though and it's like yeah
holdo gets more development than akbar which is precisely our problem it's not that that's a
reason why holdo should have more screen time than akbar it's just such a circular reasoning
like because that's how they decided to write the characters which was a huge mistake both of these
statements are true and whether it's a mistake or not as rags asserts it's hard for us to say what
would be better as we have not seen the ultimate reality so much be better fucking anything would
be better than holdo come on tiaro come on holdo was so fucking shit like any i'd take i'd roll
the dice and be like anything yeah anything just something else dm which akbar is in charge for me
at least i was more interested in what the character did rather than who they were furthermore
i don't get why people act like replacing dern with akbar would have changed anything removing
i mean in an alternate timeline it would change a lot and replacing it with one who's established
in the universe yeah by virtue alone of the fact that we wouldn't have her crap like they'd have
to rewrite the dialogue because you wouldn't hear dern lines out of akbar they'd have to change it up
uh the fact that this is all about like as rags said this is a start and he's referenced
like the payoff obviously that's that's it's pretty superficial as a payoff because we already
have a problem with hyperdrive ramming anyway but like the changes don't just stop with you
literally superimpose a fucking picture of akbar over holdo and then you rub the fill the exact
same way obviously he would do akbar things yeah and you could explore his character and he could
refer to the past when we fought the first death star we didn't you know such and such when he he
could talk about the stuff that he had done exactly and it could be very impactful in the story already
fine where the actor hadn't died and akbar had been given a featuring role they wouldn't
have had to change how dern was written because akbar is such a boring life no because he hasn't
had a chance for it yet he doesn't that's the thing we don't know if he's boring and lifeless
we haven't had the chance to explore his character he has like two minutes of screen time it's like
we we don't even know akbar this is the point he's there we know he hasn't been invented here's
the thing here's the admiral akbar has been established to do more military stuff than
holdo does remember the line where he's like oh is that the holdo from the planet blah blah blah
where they had the war blah blah you can swap that out for akbar the guy who took down the second
death star and that actually happened like we actually saw that all the guy who helped take
down the second death star obviously he's not in the movie for long but he says things he tells
tell people like do military maneuvers he establishes himself as a military leader
god damn it quinton is being a meme in the early 2000s akbar being in the role would have changed
nothing but the color of dern's skin wrong only if you decided to do nothing with it he's saying
that holdo looks like akbar but with white skin that's a bit embarrassing quinn that's kind of
embarrassing i don't know why he'd insult admiral akbar yeah i mean fuck he's hot compared to holdo
come on yeah man it's just like man it's so pathetic it's an offhand statement that poe
basically screwed over the rebellion with his numerous mistakes yeah name one name one name
one mistake poe made with the information he had and rags gets very upset about this insisting
that poe was the only character in the entire movie who is acting sensibly yep now i understand why
you would think this is the case because poe is portrayed to make you think that he's the hero
just reference a mistake he made quinton stopped going with the fucking metaphor
but that's only so you can find out that he did wrong things later in the movie he did wrong
things that's how he just explained poe did wrong things like if you rewrote the script in such a
way that poe got killed off in the first 10 minutes and he wasn't in the rest of the movie
then the rebellion would have gotten out you're right no no no he's right but it's because of
holdo not because of poe well what i'm what i'm saying is he's doing this thing where he acts like
these characters are in a vacuum yeah and i like if you change something like that with poe not
being around then you would have to have somebody else to do the things and if they didn't do any of
those things well the characters would be changed by that stuff and who knows what they would have
done in that place it's just it's it's like this domino effect well you know he assumes his proof
that poe is to blame and made mistakes is the fact that if poe didn't exist things would have gone
well but it's that's that's the same logic as you know the winter soldier fucks up a lot of
shit in um well civil war and winter soldier you could be like so clearly winter soldier did a
bunch of wrong things because if he wasn't in it these wouldn't have happened it's like that's not
true he was he was fucking brainwashed like it takes a bit more nuance than that poe wouldn't
have made all his decisions had uh holdo not been retarded it's it's definitely holdo's fault not
pose and the thing is if poe had not destroyed the dreadnought then the movie would have been
done yeah that's the other thing the dreadnought would have wiped them out so the dreadnought
would have just blown him up if we're going to go with the vague broad definition if poe never
existed in the film i think he said never existed after the first 10 minutes to cover his ass there
but let's say poe never existed at all the entire resistance is dead twice by the way because he
knocked out the star killer i don't know man it's it's weak but yeah all this because he
thinks it's like imagine like i don't what this fascination they have with holdo well it's just
sad it's like just let it go holdo's awful she's a really awfully written character it's like no
no nothing's bad about the last jedi no no no no no it's like oh god man their arguments are just
just as bad as everything else in this video this movie completely fine firstly he destroys
an entire classification of their fleet and kills well over a hundred of their barely surviving
crew members who kills poe i think you may have seen a different film mate uh poe isn't
a psychopathic murderer who runs around stabbing people or anything well he's responding to people
that don't exist maybe he's talking about a movie or not oh that would explain this entire video
rags they're watching it they've been watching a different film to us there we go this video is
like an scp this is actually like a clip from an alternate universe that somehow bled into our
version of youtube by the way do you know um him saying that he that poe's killed everyone he
reminds me of like propaganda like if you were on the front lines you knew what poe did but then if
you look at it from the perspective of like the war generals that generate all of the media like
poe is evil he killed everyone that's what he actually did it's like did he yeah you think the
nazi's thought very highly of a silly side serve very interesting quinton you're like you have to
sell poe's decisions as the the results we saw on screen even though it's obviously holdo's fault
that everyone gets killed not poe's it's like if i and fundamentally snoke is the one who kills them
so you know how do we want to frame this it depends it's completely up to you i suppose
to do something that has nothing to do with their survival and against a direct order from their
general now i can see because he saved everyone's lives a direct order of the from the general to
just wait it out and peter up and fucking get killed if it you know if the general just sat
around doing nothing as the fleet was dying he would be relieved of command on spot i just want
to if quinton was here but when you're uh your general tells you to take out your pistol and
point it at your head and pull the trigger what do you do you're going to ignore the direct command
from your general yeah it's the general and then it turns out that quinton's gun was swapped out
for a gun that injects him with a super intelligence and strength bug that allows him to save the day
and he didn't believe his general and so everyone dies because he couldn't save them with the with
the injection there you go i just created a retarded story that's just like the last jedi
he's a bad soldier bad soldier quinton you should listen to your fucking general the
the scene the scene should have been where poe saves the fleet and so leia says wow i was wrong
you saved all of our lives and this is confirmed later and you saved all of our lives uh it's been
pointed out though maybe i should learn to trust those around me or put more faith in you poe
because you made the right call that i didn't see the the the fact is as well um you you gotta
you gotta consider that the bombers were already prepped for that very purpose in the beginning
sorry your voice isn't coming through man it's it's robot in a bit and i can't hear you now
i hope at least the stream could hear it oh dear is it any better if i sound like a robot still
i'm gonna assume i still sound like a robot yeah uh
hello hello hello heard you right i heard i hear you now let's just hope that was a bit of a gap um
what i was saying is that uh poe's plan the whole time was to knock out the uh the turrets even from
the beginning and so the bombers we're assuming that must be a part of the plan because otherwise
what the hell would be the point in poe doing that and on top of that the bombers appear about
a couple of like space meters away from the the uh the dreadnought yeah they're right there they're
not with the fleet man crude armed fuel they are there and when you look at how slowly they travel
that means that if they'd aborted they would have been shot down very easily so uh ignoring layer
in the in the beginning is absolutely valid because he was right and he does save the
resistance by knocking out the dreadnought and then ignoring holdo later was completely i would
have done the exact same thing again the analogy with the uh the gunpoint at quinton's head is
what i'm gunning for yeah the the stranger thing is how holdo wasn't mutiny how the mutiny didn't
happen like by everybody yeah because if you're on a ship like that especially in a resistance
which they don't establish how official this military is but if the general is just sitting
around saying oh just have hope and you have the enemy bearing down on you and the clock's ticking
and you're not doing anything not giving any orders there is absolutely going to be a mutiny
because yeah chain of command is important but people don't want to be led to their you know
deaths anything any attempt at anything is better than just sitting there and dying and the final
piece of argumentation i think is relevant uh poe mutes layer for himself the bombers choose to
follow poe instead of their general so it's not poe's fault they made their choice like
what else do you want from that scene yeah that's true yeah pull back they don't you know
and and this is the kind of stuff that this this is why a debate or a conversation with quinton
this would all fall apart because these are pieces of information you can't deny this is what's
objective about the story and so you're just in trouble at that point and so it's much better to
just make a video where you can invent what minregs say and knock down straw men and then let that
the jelly men fall on themselves i i just i like the idea of a jelly man it feels like something
that the quinton would have invented for him he looks like he's made of jelly and so
yeah like the i mean we've still got a good 13 i don't know 19 minutes of the video while we're
nearly at four hours and 45 minutes of course 23 23 minutes yeah there's gonna be more stuff
that he's gotten wrong but i mean me and rags have basically torn apart an hour and a half of this
geez so like i know there's a lot of people who want us to go right to the end but i don't think
we're gonna be able to pull that off without going over six hours again which is not exactly
preferable for us i am this is awful man no it is really bad this vid like this is the worst
i've ever seen well i mean it's gonna be the worst for us because it's about us at least
the other topics like don't concern us as directly yeah like this is about us and it's just
blatant straw manning taking us out of context implying intention when there isn't any making
shit up like this is shit and quite frankly when the right opinion said that he was thinking about
taking it down you should have you should have taken this video down because this video is a
stain on your channel yeah i would say so as someone who actually likes a lot of the content
he comes out with like this is easily his worst video this is this is bad man like i don't i
don't know you i don't know anything about you other than this video is terrible and yeah um
i mean i stand by my video and i can back that up and i have been for the last fucking 11 10 hours
but man this would be really tough for you and some people are like yeah i'm gonna stand
some people are asking if we do a part three it's like i i feel like this is not going to be
anything different really i feel like we'd be beating a dead horse yeah like two parts i think
is excessive alone to be honest to be two e-faps of just like normal parts through six and four or
five hours whatever yeah man well i was gonna say are you would you be happy to sort of stop here
or do you want to give it a few more minutes like what would you prefer um we let's get to the end
of quinton's being wrong section here and then we can call it he blew up a lot of bad guys but when
they get a new leader poe actively acts like she must be evil or stupid because she's kind of like
the whole audience do yeah man like why can you not see why people nothing this isn't even talking
about whether or not you agree with can't you see why people would think that and can't you see
why many characters in the film see it that way she is incompetent as a leader and again we're
meant to believe that poe is on the right and that she is on the wrong so that we can find out that
we as an audience are wrong poe then personally sense not why the film definitely portrays it
that way it doesn't make any sense yes the film is trying to do something but it fails miserably
at it and kind of proves the opposite point because of how incompetently it's written and portrayed
by the way hashtag poe did nothing wrong
Rose and Finn on a mission that almost everyone seems to agree had no points and worked directly
against the cause of the rebellion and just wasted a lot of time and resources and how you can attack
the director from an out-of-universe perspective but not the person who planned the mission from
an in-universe perspective but because he wrote it the fucking movie quit this is a thing that
actually happened this is a story that someone wrote these characters are not real the characters
in the film don't exist good lord quinton oh my god holdo isn't real she's a character in a work of
fiction they didn't write their own scripts extremely confusing that's because you're a
simple and then he figures out what holdo's plan is and he tells fin poe and some stranger
oh no he doesn't calm signal he doesn't tell deejay deliberately and then he says by the way
go on that ship with the bad guys and then they all get kidnapped by the first order
it's like my pausing is super delayed uh yeah he he's talking to fin it is fin's fault that
deejay here's the plan he does not tell deejay he tells what was it rose or poe who was holding
it is poe is talking to rose and fin on a little telecom and then he says have you guys found the
code breaker which has been vouched for by maz and what does fin say uh we found a code breaker
not on poe that's on the people that's on fin we're like yeah it's
damn my internet yeah and whenever poe in they don't say that you know let's go someplace
private or keep it down or put it into do i have a headset or something no no it's just
oh man this is a weak sauce defense for it and if anything it makes it makes poe and fin look
incompetent not poe oh sorry it makes fin and rose look incompetent not poe
so this is a stupid point quinton just like the rest of all the ones that you've made
i'm just gonna do the same thing i did distinguish between fantasy and reality
give me give me one second you're still here i'm gonna reset and ryan johnson
hello
but essentially uh everything fin and rose does yes everything fin and rose
yeah i was saying that this point that he's making doesn't make poe look incompetent it
makes fin and rose look like they fucked up royally it's not poe's fault it is fin and rose's
fault yeah they should have been smarter than to fucking let that guy hear the correspondence from
the leader of the resistance they should have been like go wait another room please
so i don't know how long quinton will carry on with this
just inherently flawed idea but okay and the stranger tells the first order what the plan is
i don't want to people die but the fans stand around like oh holdo should have told him more
yes yes what yes you're not countering this couldn't you just put on a stupid voice
yeah that's not an argument you're not making an argument she should have told the fucking
well whoever's rank was commander or major or whatever i think he got to move to captain
you tell your captain the play and i don't buy that bullshit about he she thought he was a spy
no it's not in the film killer base in the dreadnought is it's not in the film and she
actually says that she does like him remember so you gotta read out the fact that she thinks he's
a fucking bull like he's our number one war hero it just doesn't make any sense and put on a
stupid voice rags you fucked you put on a stupid yeah i guess but i really have no contextually
they're on a ship that where they have to guard the escape pods because almost everyone is trying
to sneak out second of all po told what does that have to do with anything yeah that doesn't
have anything to do with anything why do they have to guard the escape pods why would people
want to leave if there's a plan exactly they wouldn't leave on the escape pods if they knew
the plan because the plan would be better than going through the escape pods yeah quinton you're
dumb the less you talk the better your argument is he's making the film worse first order what
the plan was and your answer is wish to just give him more top secret militaristic uh no because
po's not in the first order you fucking troll us like what are you talking po would have heard the
plan and been like right then let's sit down and do nothing to the whole film yeah yeah information
and was the difference between his understanding of the plan and the actual plan really that great
because you see he thought they were gonna sneak away on some ships and just try and sneak away
from the battle and yeah that's a bit different from having a planet to be able to hide on versus
just sneaking away hopefully it's space where are you gonna hide this is are you he's suggesting
that po's plan window is no real difference from holdo's plan or something it's like well shouldn't
that then add to our argument that you should have told him the plan because he was on board with one
that was similar yeah fucking hell geez you're real in a non-heroic way and then and then later
later tells him well actually we were going to sneak away from the battle and hide on a planet
like i don't know how more information would have stopped how do you hide a planet what do you
mean he doesn't understand how more information would have it's like that information po literally
says wow this might actually work they pose on board with it so none of the shit with the stupid
b-plot would have happened none of that would have happened i was not significant as a change
that's ignoring the fact that somehow the first order just didn't look out a window and see this
planet or anything like that like that's ignoring all of that nonsense that doesn't make any sense
in any universe like how did how did tro proof this and be like that makes sense that's a good
argument it's terrible oh man and pose just an idiot literally the only thing he does right in
the movie is when he helps them escape from crate without the first order noticing and the whole
point of that scene is that leah literally gives him command because he's doing the right yeah other
than every other right decision he makes that's the only right decision he makes i agree with you
that was right but also the other ones were right too unless they're not even talking about how
stupid that seat is with c3po is like there is no other way out of this place and then he's like
wait there's gotta be right like 10 minutes later and he's like you know actually yes there may be
a way out of this place it's like oh yeah it's like there was a path but it's covered up by you
know of a closer gap or something and even i don't get it man i just the po thing is just it should
be so cut and dry to people no but they just they i think they want to think that what the
movie wants them to think is actually like it actually makes sense right thing like you can
pretend that from a certain skewed point of view maybe po was secretly the hero of the movie
but in order to really skewed point of view like what scenes should we ignore
and also why is he implying that the hero can't make mistakes maybe because he's used to having
ray be the hero it's just a hero can fuck up you know if you do the crazy crazy thing and watch
the movie and take the scenes for what they are you might come up with the idea the crazy idea
that po made good decisions crazy idea though yeah it's like someone a comment like elvic in
the chat is saying but the movie said po is wrong like abbott use your fucking brain
of characters just pointing out that he's done something stupid and that he screwed everyone
over and post saying but he hasn't you're right oops nearly she would have had some development
in a previous movie or something ideally her home address would have been on alderaan
oh rags i think they've understand what she did because po damron did ruin everything what no
po didn't no absolutely not he didn't ruin everything he was the only person in the fucking
resistance who was making the right calls at the time he seemed to be the only person who was doing
the right thing what's worse is that po damron's arc if you could call it that basically revolves
around him giving up the traits of his that were useful and were successful and saved people
instead teaching him to blindly follow authority even though it will lead to worse scenarios and
outcomes or alternatively to be less aggressive and hot-headed even if it leads to worse outcomes
because of it it makes no sense it follows his previous point by saying that although he accepts
its plot contrived it says um so do you want to try and i don't know do you want to just skip to
the end see how they end it yeah because uh 20 minutes is going to take us another two hours i
think yeah just fucking go for it oh oh oh yeah yeah how dare i hate everything trying to say who
isn't is to defend yeah yeah yeah yeah me me i get to do that because because i'm objecting that
oh you're defending his gatekeeping i was going to say wait did we just catch quit and say uh see
this is why we shouldn't watch it out of context we should just skip to the end just go back just
go back like 15 20 seconds what time is it on for you right now it's 144 59 so go to 144 40
okay looking alex because he put the words fans in quotation marks so-called fans
yeah that's gatekeeping yeah that's fucking gatekeeping very simple it's just well yeah
surely you would get against someone deciding who is and isn't real fans you got accused of
gatekeeping by his entire audience and it's just so funny because like that's like the most classic
version of gatekeeping you can get like you're not a real fan like in my video i'm against
the gate this like the thing just because of the movie says it doesn't mean it actually is
but i guess because quinn says it oh wow i just realized they put the timer of your video on
screen now oh that's nifty me you could have had that you know you could have had that throughout
the rest of the video but it might have gotten in the way of your points so i could understand
why you didn't oh so embarrassing fans you're gonna tell people who are and are not fans of star
wars oh oh oh yeah yeah how dare i hate everything try and say who isn't is to defend yeah who gives
him the fucking right to decide who isn't isn't a fan of i think he wants to follow up with saying
that you do the same thing but i'm waiting for him to prove it i want to prove it all right i get to
do that because because because i'm objective i'm objective i never said that but i never said that
i can't foresee you liking quinton until the end of your days right after this video well he's a
piece of shit uh so it that sums up every response we could have to quinn i didn't say that absolutely
correct rhino milk is way better than quinton oh yes definitely agree with that him though when
alex does it that makes him a bad person no self-awareness at all it says it's not a piece
of dreadful filmmaking man that's just it's just that's we would we would have missed that if we
didn't skip to this random point i know this is the thing there's probably a lot of content left
to be honest we were random point in the rest of this film video thing train wreck and it's him
just inventing shit just making shit up him doing that's part for the course of this video at least
at least like guys if there is a point you want us to respond to in the end part that we're skipping
over just just know that it will comment it will likely be us saying we didn't say that like you
could just cut that out of this video and play it whatever you see anything else i was going to say
do you want to do the last two minutes let's see what happens in there turpted it is far from my
favorite ihg video but to frame as this person who's out for the blood of everyone who dislikes
last jedi is something that i cannot disagree with more and when he attempts to demonstrate that
he's going after extreme people rags becomes annoyed and says he's meant to be addressing
the real criticisms as if there are points that we're meant to address and points we're not and
when he expresses some criticisms are way more substantive than others also that's a really
like just just just a very very unfair view of what rags his response was that's a very interesting
takeaway from my video it would be like i'll just do the same thing tro can't accept that rags has
an opinion and this entire video is him reading about it there you go can't stand that he agrees
with about as much of it as he does so he tries to tone it down but yeah i guess you know he says
that which is fair i suppose that was a very unfair summary and the easiest counter i would
have is that i had everything cites a very reasonable set of comments as the vitriolic
backlash and rags points out that that's not the case at all with what you've just referenced
done i wonder if the right opinion has said anything about the immense vitriol of his the
comments in his video yeah what he does like although sometimes rags may dispute him with
fair and reasonable points other times he just comes up with half ass explanations to denigrate
or dismiss the point and he like quinn like quinton throughout this entire video we don't
know which one he's even referring to from his perspective other than if i can't prove something
with absolute certainty then i shouldn't even make the judgment on it i don't know that's pretty weak
sauce though oh wait lee brown guy said you missed an important part 144 20 if you watched
it interrupted because you did miss the context they play a clip i'm not a fan of quinton but
you did take it out of context okay let's take a look 144 20 i'm assuming this is back to
a comment about the fans i guess keep doing the ho ho ho self-awareness points has buried any
real criticism of the film self-awareness folks by the way can we just stop to remember all the
times in this video that rags has claimed that i hate everything isn't a real fan to prove his
point if you call yourself a star wars fan no no no you're not what i'd call a star wars fan
i'd call you a star wars apologist yeah it's the same i mean it's pretty coy and you said it's
what i would call you you i guess you could call that gatekeeping of some kind but like
only in terminology i mean that's definitely not what i mean what i would say is i do you honestly
think that i would call him a star someone who is defending star wars and who has an emotional
connection to star wars is like not a star wars fan yeah i think that's the important distinction
rags didn't say he's not a fan i'm saying he would call him an apologist before calling him
a fan so like the idea that they would say that and not see the obvious thing of i'm saying that
he is emotionally attached to it and that he is making arguments for it and that he's an
apologist for it but i don't think he's a fan yeah i really i don't get the impression from
that statement that he's saying that i hate everything isn't a fan yeah or that he's not
like a real fan or anything like that yeah definitely not and it's definitely not what
i'd take away from it but i mean you know it's it's it's as if i hate everything doesn't do
the same but worse i guess would be my biggest counter to that and obviously quinn quinn is
just hypocritical to defend one and attack the other yeah now there's destiny to comparison
which is i see why he would take an issue with it i'll i guess in the future i'll be more clear
but i still will stand up for what i said that he's he's an apologist you know he's he's i've
said that very clearly he's emotionally attached to it he has a star wars apologist and i think
that doesn't include him being a fan of it is kind of strange now there's destiny to comparison
which is insufficient on multiple occasions the destiny to comparison is extremely poignant
and it works pretty much as a slam dunk um and you've not proven otherwise tro from what i've seen
it's like nope although he does close the video by saying he watched the destiny 2 video it really
does not feel like he did because it in no way reflects the sort of vitriol that yeah as the chat
is saying like obviously an apologist would be include being a fan of something you know
you practice yeah you would be a fan to be an apologist of the thing yeah unless you're
playing a devil's advocate which he's definitely not doing are you going to be an apologist for
things you hate like of course not obviously not um i was gonna say something about what he just
said but i forgot it hang on you watched the destiny 2 video it really does not feel like
he did because yes so uh big bit cruel there as well tro taking him out of context rags did not
say that someone saying the will helm scream is not in the last jedi and that's bad is the
same as the lot uh i hate everything's video on destiny 2 the point is that uh i hate everything
complains about everybody in this big bubble that includes people like me and people like those
comments you referenced which are exactly the same as what rags uh what i had everything did
in his destiny 2 video it's just criticism long criticism of the story the mechanics
just everything and this is the thing rags approves of that stuff
i like i'd like his destiny 2 video i thought it was very good and he's pointing out that i hate
everything is criticizing the people who are doing the very thing that he does it's very simple like
you don't need to say you see rags you're wrong because i hate everything didn't say something
like there's no scream in destiny 2 and that's why it's bad so they're clearly different things
like that's not what rags said anyway so more about the concept comment that wasn't a comment
somebody made about i was upset i was just mad that ihe criticized destiny yeah and i think he
he might actually reference a couple of like he does he does it in the comment comebacks as well
where he highlights people at all the other end of the spectrum the ones who love something ridiculously
it's just strange because i made a video about destiny 2 and i think i said it was like
exceedingly mediocre or something like that i was not a fan of it and i haven't played it since i
made that video no way reflects the sort of vitriol that ihe is referring to in all honesty
you're unlikely to enjoy the video if you're an ihe fan just because of that tone of contempt
that rags seems to pertain if this is something you enjoyed wait i i wouldn't like his video if
i'm not a fan of him he said that if you're an i hate everything fan you're not going to enjoy rags
his video just because of rags his contempt like the tone implying that if you like i hate everything
you're going to struggle to like rags his video regardless because of the tone well i think a lot
of people have the problem of they think that if i criticize something that they like that i'm
criticizing them not to mention uh i would say worse for your video tro if you're a fan of me if
you're a fan of rags if you're a fan of quinton if you're a fan of tro if you're a fan of i hate
everything this video falls short massively it's uh i was expecting more yeah definitely then more
power to you but it's not for me i'm sorry one of the more thought-provoking points made was about
the negativity bus but i'm not sure i he covered it in the right way you see for me there's a lot
more to say when you find something you disagree with rather than when there's something that you
agree with and in reviews and in responses like these it can often give off the impression that
there was more dislike than like i can see that rags made some there was there was it was almost
like a two-to-one what is um what is the footage in the background too it's well you see
this represent this is it's gonna be straddling the middle line or something is that what this
represents it represents the balancing that a content creator has to do as he attempts to
navigate across the chasm of negativity that is uh critic criticism culture on the internet in
order to hopefully reach metaphorical success on the other side fair points but on balance i find
that he was too obsessed with his own negativity and consequently diametrically opposing himself
to almost everything that right he said i think you diametrically opposed yourself to almost
everything rag said because you're trying to defend i hate everything no matter what
yeah he sounded kind of grudging that you agreed with me in a lot of things yeah it was difficult
to watch you agree with rags because of how difficult you made it look you're like i guess
people in the comments saying that they love how i hate everything but they also liked my video so
this is the thing i like i hate everything i still watch some of his videos but like when i
watched your takedown i was just like yeah that was pretty easy for you to do because
i had everything made a piss pull video and this is the thing when we talked to him he said he
regrets making it it was like extremely rushed he doesn't even know what the point really was
for the video i mean there's there's i hate everything regretted making his the right opinion
clearly had regrets because he was seriously considering taking it down i never thought
about taking mine down and i don't know why you would because it holds up never had a inkling of
a thought in my head of taking my video down because i stand by it this is not to say that
me and rags have not made any error whatsoever in any small way in both of our videos that have
been criticized you uh i accept the fact that i didn't eat before this i accept that i need to be
more explicit uh in many parts of my videos so that people don't i will i'll do the same i will
try to be more explicit when i talk um many months have gone by and yeah i'd say the efaps have
helped me a lot yeah we got to sort of reflect i'm gonna start yeah it really helps to get your
yours and wolves and cinema sin sins and smuds and all that to get their opinions it really
helps out and i'm it's my intention to do reviews in the future on games i've got some line to do
when i start doing content really soon for everyone if you're asking um and doing the efaps
will definitely help when i look over things same thing with watching uh people like matthew
mitosis and stuff you know you learn a lot from doing it yourself over and over and from watching
other people who are better than you uh at that do it as well and let this video be a lesson as
to how you do not respond to people like you don't invent things they said you don't change
what they said to mean something else like literally taking a clip and saying it's from
a different section of the video that shit's fucked up don't do that yeah i mean and you can
respond to videos where nobody says anything wrong you can have a different way of maybe
like if if somebody wants to i mean if it really is all subjective and some of this was some of
this was talking about you know objective stuff in the film but you don't have to necessarily
disagree with somebody to make a response to them yeah and turning perceptively anodyne statements
into controversial one anodyne statements i i'll have to look it up anodyne is that a word
anodyne anodyne not likely to cause offense or disagreement and somewhat dull all right
yeah not likely to provoke dissenter offensive and offensive often do
anodyne i have never heard of that one i'm putting that in my list not saying it's wrong
to use words i've never heard of i'm just saying anodyne it here's the thing i it's
fine to use words and stuff i wish you'd have a word of the day or a word of the video or
it's fine if you use a word and then tell us what it means but like if i was listening to
this and that word went by i don't know what that word means so i wouldn't understand
the idea you're trying to get across which is detrimental if you're trying to get across an idea
um and yeah if the point is that he's taken inoffensive comments from i had everything
and made them offensive it'd be like why not just say that why say anodyne anodyne i don't even know
what variation he used and again you could be like well mauler he knows what it is i know what
it is who cares if you don't and i'd be like that's fair enough i've never heard of the word
anodyne before that's all never i i it has a y i didn't spell it wrong yeah same for me i i typed
it didn't type it with a y it's like a fucking lord the rig's word but uh yep anodyne was everything
that i h is set and turning perceptively anodyne statements in perceptively anodyne statements
come on man get your key get done with all my yeah all my art assets are now officially finished
as of an hour ago so i'll make sure there's going to be edits to oh that's great i'll look at those
after here rags this is completely subjective how many percent of people do you think understood
when tiaro said he makes perceptively anodyne statements um less than five i think less than
that too yeah i if i mean like i i get it it's fun to let everyone know that you know a word most
people don't know it's good to have that knowledge but ultimately if you say it and you know that
people are not going to understand what you're saying then why did you bother saying it especially
when there are words that make it easier like inoffensive is the word i would use instead innocuous
bland neutral yeah just yeah it's like you could say something like his inoffensive um harmless
anodyne statements you know like really like that's the way to do it so now whenever you hear
that word again you're like oh because i because it was you such and such and and i'm not this isn't
a a point against his points jetta said seven percent which isn't a lot i'm just saying that
top memes i would just say no one knows what he means so oh yeah words are trying to you know
that's what words are for the controversial ones to sum up i do not like rags his video i wish him
the best and hope that he takes my feedback in good spirit your video is shit though i don't
necessarily how does rags take your video in good spirit exactly tiaro how does he do that
to be completely honest i guess i could have been more clear on some things that's the best thing
you can say but that's really the best that i can do man like i'm gonna be real with you
what a train wreck yeah i will i this is just maybe a reminder to sometimes remind myself
to be clear and concise and that's really taking it pretty far
so i'd expect them to for me there were parts of this video which feel intended to spite or turn
people against i ate everything good god tiaro what can we say about parts of your video
they're intended to lie about me and rags to sell us shorts you want people to fucking
hate me i get the impression you want people to hate my fucking guts and for anybody who's curious
at the beginning 20 minutes of this part uh me and rags read out a lot of the top comments
from his video they are not very kind to rags they hate they want to punch me dude they don't
like me at all get off the high horse immediately tiaro it's a rotting corpse of a horse it's not
a good word to sit on good lord oh it's enough of your hyperbole thing in ways that i don't think
i could endorse ever i'm aware he's not looking for my endorsements but that's tiaro i don't hear
about enforcement from someone like you and i certainly don't give a shit about what quinton
has to say why would rags want your endorsement at this point why would i want your endorsement
like again i'm still i'm still friends with with with tiaro and i would probably happily have him
uh read through a script before i release it just to get his perspective but you've given no reason
for rags to think anything of you in a positive light let's put it that way yeah generally you
start off with your strongest work also i just saw that uh i just want to point out rags that
you used the word detrimental when you could have said unhelpful detrimental is a very common word
detrimental is pretty yeah i think colloquially most people understand what detrimental means
like is bad for that's what i've always known detrimental to mean like it i don't i think
that's pretty common compared to anodyne yeah i don't know and this is subjective like i can't
know what everyone knows about weirds i'm just going from what i know about talking to people
in my daily routines detrimentals use far more than anodyne all the time yeah a detriment as
opposed to it's my opinion but i get it we could always there's there's words me and rags will use
that could have simpler versions i just want to use words that i know people have heard
yeah i'm not saying dumb down your language to the lowest common denominator just if you want
to sprinkle in some words that most people won't understand let people know what that word means or
else there was no point in saying it at all i've been showing off that you know a word that most
people don't yeah you know what i think detrimental is pretty anodyne
i just hate quitting more i'll take it i'll fucking take it i'm sure many of you are familiar with
him already on top of that even bigger thanks to everyone one two three four five six seven eight
nine editors geez nine editors man who's been involved with editing this their links will be
in the description to check out their stuff this was not easy to make anyhow i'd love to hear what
you think let me know in the comments below until yeah we know what they think yeah they
fucking hate me because you've painted a picture of me that isn't true thanks a lot for that
tro i appreciate that thank you and i think that's then i'm the right opinion and i'll see you
in the next one and yeah obviously we can't respond to everything in the video we've missed
out about 20 minutes but i think that was pretty solid considering we've gotten i think that's
like nearly oh coming up to 12 hours of content for you guys if you if you call it content is dead
so yeah just just for the closing statements this video uh really awful uh just just goddamn
awful and it's it's so awful because of the fact that it's so uh i don't know malicious towards
both me and rags yeah and i've probably done that in the past too i would say i have but that's
something that i know now to like kind of watch for i suppose to really remind myself not oh yeah
this will be a strong lesson for me going forward like to make sure i'm very careful about what
people fucking say because good lord you can lie very easily and that's not to say that me and rags
have ever done we have a principle when it comes to responding people we do not fucking take their
comments and tell people they they were about a different thing that's fucked up yeah man like i
can hate your guts like i would never take an eta sarkeesian i would never take jonathan i would
never deliberately take them out of context like that i would never do that i just i wouldn't i
wouldn't uh living with myself because i know every day when i wake up that i did that it's
not a good counter if you you literally invent the cat the thing in the first place it's like do i
need to explain what a fucking straw man is to you quinton like come on is the whole there's a reason
why that's the most commonly used fallacy it's like the one of the easiest ones to prove
and how long did it take us we were like oh yeah we have to search through the entirety of rags
this video so we had to get someone to find this the fucking stamp for us because of how hard it
is to find out whether or not he's lying adomie yeah adomie said i was surprised by some of the
top comments for rags in the video he was like it was like i was like this does not sound like
ranks at all he's like yeah probably because i got fucking edited so much that yeah you you
might get that impression because i get little tiny snippets rag your name is rag from now on
according to this remember rag is dead i'll i'll get through the legs isn't dead he was murdered
so who's the biggest piece of shit was a movie bob or quinton it's like for me and rags it's
got to be quinton just because of the shit that he said about us movie bob hasn't even acknowledged
our existence really he he said a few quotes that may have come from my video that's the most movie
bob's ever done yeah but then again movie bob's the person where if he had an infinity gauntlet
there would be no republicans alive and i don't mean that as a joke yeah so i guess we could say
like for the masses the worst is movie bob for us it's quinton and it's probably i don't even know
if quinton's aware that we've made these two responses i know that tro is and i'm still going
to try and see if i can get him on the next uh efap so that he could perhaps discuss anything
he wants to discuss i'm not sure where that would go i totally he's gonna do that i seriously don't
but we we'll we'll see what happens with that uh in regards to legends it was like taking a nice
oh wait i read that sorry uh in the movie up tells an entire life story in eight minutes you can do a
lot in 11 yep thank you both for these videos i'm firmly in the camp um oh god it skipped why did
you do this to me god damn it there we go in the camp of criticism objective criticism of art bad
art is real and it usually comes down to the craft anyone who says otherwise is a fake artist
um character flat lines fin the storm trooper who one movie ago watched other troopers mass execute
people linds there are bad people in the galaxy imagine that it's yeah it's bizarre the morality
is confusing fin it's like the the the market in which the bad people exist is run on selling
shit to both the good and bad and he's just like oh man everyone's capable of bad i guess i'll i
guess i'll just sacrifice myself for the resistance like that doesn't pan out at all film uh who's
worst quinton or the not so great debate guy i have to say the not so great debate guy
was way more honest like he had was honest had some bad arguments but by the end of the
the conversation i believe he was saying that he was sort of came around to some of the ideas
if i remember and the fact is he was willing to talk to us um yeah he was willing to talk and
he wasn't like lying or anything he was legitimately defending a point that he
actually held with the best of the information that he had um thank you molyne rags for showing
us how i nep the majority of these reviewers are keep it up boys great work you bet uh the u.s made
kinetic energy missiles which go from space down to earth and are nothing more than a big bar of
metal so why wouldn't going at the speed of light with any dense aircraft destroy a ship
this is the thing um and if they make the rule that they can't it makes warfare so much easier
in star wars because otherwise they'll have to account for it in every single battle but now
they've said you can and so now i'm just looking forward to episode nine when there's a space battle
and then they have to do something to account for it so curious about episode nine man i am just
oh i like i don't like like i said i don't consider myself like a star wars fan anymore
um like i like the you know not i guess not in a colloquial sense like i like the universe and
everything but i feel like i completely it's like i just cut away seven and eight yeah and solo
just cut them away they don't exist and that's star wars for me yeah i would just say i'm a fan
of star wars as a whole but i'm obviously thinking about the good times whenever i consider myself a
fan i'm like oh man the best of star wars that's where i'm at um why didn't they ram the ships that
were losing fuel into the enemy fleet we did mention that stupid that's a good question um
maybe quinton can fill us in maul you've become this series mr plinkett i mean he did a great
video on the last jedi just like me i feel like me and him have very different styles but
yeah his video was really good and it was just like it came out so late they they clearly didn't
want to just rehash everything that had already been said yeah so that in mind it was a good it
was a good no good bit uh since there's no up and down in space couldn't a large fleet just
hyperspace come from underneath another fleet um if they did that in the movies and it breaks
all cinematic battle rules yeah that um that's a part of the space battles i mean they depending
on what direction they are coming from yeah but generally it's like in star trek they always have
the ships meeting on the same you know plane same you know axis or whatever um i think that's just
done for simplicity of the viewer's sake yeah but also but in real but in real life that would that
would be an issue um i don't think it'd be a huge one generally ships would probably as a
as a courtesy they would level off with each other or there would be like a fixed up and down
you know system that everybody would adhere to whenever meeting another ship but yeah you're
right and let's be honest it's like don't don't these conflate it's like the rules of the space
battles are out the window now like who knows what they'll do uh the scene would have been
functionally the same if akbar crashed the ship in snow ship at sub light speed um sub light speed
i'm not sure what the um sub light speed is slower than the speed of light
oh so you're saying like if you'd actually just fly into it yeah i'd be i'd be all bored with that
would be really cool imagine the ship getting torn apart as it finally makes its target you
know like it gets to them just as it's falling apart it just crashes right in i think it'd be
amazing if like the radis was like stuck inside the supremacy like it was fucked up but it was
wedged in it went in a certain distance and just got stuck in there and then from episode nine you
could show that damage persist you know um but yeah even and even then that's sort of like a
weird thing to think about because just as fast as a ship can go you know because if a ship can go to
light speed you know how fast can it go without using a hyperdrive yeah that's ramming into other
things it would just oof interesting to think about um anodyne had a popularity bump in 1860
currently detrimental is used 28 more times more frequently than anodyne i'm assuming that's
like based on daily or i don't know but um yeah like i said i believe it i i believe that
anodyne is less common than detrimental but you know um uh the last jedi was bad
bandwagoning cum ditch that rags needs to be neutered day of the snip when intellectual giant
i mean i i think it's commenting on how uh it'd be a subby boy yes uh thanks for the vids i
recommend checking out david stewart on youtube he's a fancy writer who makes a lot of videos
about storytelling i have heard of him people want me to talk to him about civil war because
he thought civil war was really bad so who knows maybe one day that seems to be the premise for a
lot of possible conversations i could have so many people really don't like civil war i really like
man i love civil war i know it's just complicated that one i love watching you work guys i don't know
how i ever lived without efab also if you could play any tabletop game what would it be
oh there's a lot then you see dragons yeah i don't know i don't yeah i don't know either um
i'm really not sure i'm really not sure there's a lot of ones i wouldn't mind just trying i'm
assuming do they mean over the internet or do they mean like real life and i don't know um
when it comes to real life i'm a really big fan of apples and apples is probably my favorite board
game or tabletop game ever since um but when it comes to like online board games that's tough i
don't really do online board games maybe i should maybe i really should more uh quinton keeps gas
lighting tro is a pretentious crumpet snuffer t-shirt i efab to you we will make it efab one day
just um we'll have to run it for a bit longer though because i mean this is the ninth episode
we're very much an early podcast yeah but i can do that like i have a tea spring store set up that
i will be launching with my next video i could get an efap shirt and put it on there i was i was gonna
once i saw the tfa stuff i was gonna commission some art for both my channel and um efab and then
go from there with making some kind of shit we'll definitely definitely do it uh down the line
because efap is just getting lots of positive responses and stuff uh so we had like 1800 1700
people watching it once which is pretty good for yeah yeah definitely and whenever a new
controversial video essay comes out people are like do it do it because like that what about
send demar away the one from box that came out recently like we'll cover that uh eventually but
man that looked really bad as well um but yes so i guess we'll probably wrap up there
all i'll say is that um you know you can check out me and rags's channels with our main channels with
the um list in the description i believe but um if you want to see this podcast and the channel
it belongs to there is a second channel called moolah i think you can actually find it just
by typing in moolah now it's it's got enough subscribers to be recognized by youtube um i'm
putting a link in the chat as well hopefully it shows up whenever i try this a lot of the chat
just lags the fuck out um we've got uh next no i'm gonna see if i can set up having tro on at
some point if not we've got doom cock in the uh in the wings as well to come on and obviously
plenty more videos to respond to considering this one was from what more than half a year ago
and it took us two very long efaps just to respond to it so you know plenty of content to come and
again chat is just frozen for me it always does whenever i i link the uh the channel can
you see it for you rags does it come up for you in the description no in the uh the chat
let me yeah i see your links the four of them yeah okay good yeah so that channel you can find
the uh the videos that's going to be uploaded from here and um me and rags's channels you can
