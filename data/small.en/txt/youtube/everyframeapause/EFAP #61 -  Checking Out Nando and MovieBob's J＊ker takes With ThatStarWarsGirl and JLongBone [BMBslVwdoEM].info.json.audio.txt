Like make it a Dr.
Moreau type thing.
Maybe the doctor, the old guy goes nuts.
And then he's like, oh, I can.
I can make a park with the dinosaur human.
I can't wait for the third Jurassic World movie
where they still go with this idiotic premise
that using dinosaurs for the military is a good idea.
Oh, my God.
It's like you'd think after the first movie,
they would have got a clue, but they were like, no, no.
We have to make the dinosaurs into military people.
Oh, stupid.
Oh, my God, Jeff.
And oh, oh, my God, what's his name?
Vincent D'Onofrio playing that good old boy fat redneck fucker
trying to sell the shit like, oh, what, what do you say?
Struggle breeds greatness.
And yeah, we can put laser beams on dinosaurs.
And shit. Oh, my God.
I don't get the fear of this shit like he's so stupid.
The stupid second movie where the dude has the gun
with the laser pointer on it and he points it at a thing.
And it's like, why don't you just shoot the thing with the gun
instead of sending the velociraptor to kill the thing?
It's so stupid.
This is Jurassic Land and bullets magically are repelled by dinosaur skin.
I mean, they could have done it like put a chip inside the dinosaurs brain
and like give them orders.
Didn't it like die by getting impaled on like really ancient
30,000 year old bones?
What are we what are we talking about?
The death by the winner.
Dom, whatever the stupid name for the stupid like Carl Weird Raptor is
in the second Jurassic World, how it died.
Oh, yeah. Dom is in domino.
This abominable race in the raptor and the raptor.
That's what it was called.
Didn't it like they had to kill it by like throwing it down.
Which is what the French called Vietnam.
Oh, at the Battle of the Unbound Fool.
So it's going to be weird.
So it will be a sudden update.
Whenever that happens, everything gets fucked.
So like chat is not on screen because for no reason.
It's also no reason.
Dreaming the wrong.
Everything is wrong right now.
It's it's got the right title and description, but for some reason
it's got the wrong thumbnail.
I don't know how that happened.
I haven't seen you use that thumbnail in a long time, too.
But like I didn't upload.
I've not uploaded that thumbnail for like a million years.
So I don't know what the hell it's doing.
Is it on like the wrong profile?
Looks like it's on my profile.
But what is fixed?
You get the yeah, I've seen it on the recommended and the home page.
And it shows we're live.
Does it show the correct thumbnail?
Yes. OK, well, but I'm still it shows the screen that we're seeing right now.
Yeah, it shouldn't show that.
What is it doing?
It's fucking tisming.
Lying to me.
I'm curious to find out if something else has happened.
Oh, maybe it's streaming through the wrong thing, maybe.
OK, so it can't be that account.
It's not a Mueller account.
It's definitely more of some reason.
It doesn't want to listen to the hospital.
You can go through this stupid.
Right. Why would you make half a joke and then give up Rex?
Come on, because I think I think halfway through, I knew that was one.
I mean, sometimes it's best to go down with a ship.
Wait, so Shinobi said that the bones that the Indoraptor impaled itself on
weren't real bones.
They were stronger bones.
And that's why it was able to kill the Indoraptor.
So OK. OK.
Oh, OK. Yeah.
I mean, I'm not saying that your opinion doesn't matter
if you like the Jurassic World movies, but.
Oh, does he?
Is that one of his things?
Is that his?
Well, you were the one that watched it, weren't you?
Like the the puppet guy who screamed.
I remember the puppet guy.
I want to say that we didn't like make it through
almost the majority of it because something else happened
because I know like of his video, but I don't really remember his video.
If you're picking up when I'm laying down, I can't change the thumbnail.
It won't let me.
Like, I got shot on screen at least.
But are you subscribed to YouTube Red?
No. Does that have to do with anything?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe that's their new thing is that you have to be subscribed to YouTube Red.
I'm almost certain this is to do with OBS because it never before
is it asked me before I started streaming?
What would you like to title your stream?
It's like I've got the title.
I've subscribed to OBS Red.
Controversial.
There is no OBS Red.
I'll kill you.
Go to live.
Is it in the live control room now?
Is that what we're doing, YouTube?
Are you forcing me here?
The dead room.
It is.
Please tell me I'm not the only one who has to deal with this tism.
Well, I have a dream.
So I don't have to deal with it.
I haven't done a new stream since a while, so.
Oh, God, so many weird options.
They scare me.
I'm too old for this.
Excellent.
Where's the option to do a thumbnail?
Just give me the fucking option for a thumbnail.
I will hurt you.
Change thumbnail.
There we go.
YouTube, you musty bit.
Anybody who's listening to this is like, what happened?
I'm not doing a J.
OK, all my options have changed and it scares me.
OK, I'm not ready for this.
You should have figured that out beforehand.
I can't know this was going to happen until I hit stream.
This is episode like 90, 12.
Please clarify if your stream is made for kids.
Fuck off.
Oh, my. Oh, no.
Lot my big ass cock on the table.
Yeah. OK.
Get a look at that.
Run screaming.
I've already said no, Rags.
They cannot.
They're not allowed to watch those pesky children.
How dare they?
This is an this is an AO rated stream that that means adults only.
You know what?
You are below the age of twenty one.
Then you need to vacate the premise immediately or click the button
to confirm that you are over 21.
You guys know that like they're going to be nuking
classic studio by the end of this year.
Like it's just going to be gone entirely.
Classic studio.
And like the four analytics no longer work on classic.
You have to look them in the new version.
And I think what's happening is like phasing in a live stream
is no longer going to work for me on classic.
And I know how to do everything on classic.
Why are you taking it away from me?
What did I do?
We have to this is just like Disney and everyone.
You have to destroy the old things that you love and know
and that works and we're competent in order to prop up your new shitty things
that you want everyone to like.
Let the past die.
Even if it's kill it, even if it's much more superior
than your crappy new shit, new shit is terrible.
Did it hurt?
When I pen it.
Take me to the live control room.
OK, wait, is the is the thumbnail correct now or is it still being a flim?
I will look.
I will look.
No, it's still it's autism.
Oh, it's weird for me.
Subscription.
I just went on my browser.
It just oh, it just OK.
Now it's working.
Hey, it's your office.
So everything is back to normal now.
Thank goodness.
And between this and the stream that's next,
I will look into why everything is the big gay basically.
I'll be having this.
Can't be having this.
Outrageous, fruity fruity.
Oh, Rudy.
So, yes, hello, everyone.
Welcome to the number 61.
Soon to be bumped up in one number as soon as they let the BBC let go
of the other the mysterious.
It's going to need another two weeks still on that.
Oh, my goodness.
The BBC are terrible.
Pretty sure that pretty sure that my.
Well, not my ancestors, but pretty sure that the ancestors of people
in this country fought against the British in multiple wars
in order so that we didn't have to worry about the BBC claiming videos on YouTube.
Pretty sure that's in the Constitution, isn't it?
I think so.
It's one of the amendments that they added because of all this
fucking bullshit.
They just said, you know what we're going to do?
We're going to make an amendment.
Now it's constitutional. Now what?
It's pretty outrageous.
Unfortunately, yeah, it's great.
We just hope and pray that Google
finds value in the Constitution.
So cross your fingers.
It's doubtful.
Don't hold your breath.
Yeah, but we can hold out hope.
So, yeah, we the bonus, ifap.
It's it's it's seem like a thing to do.
Bone fat bones fat fat.
I can just have, you know, a moment and then everything will be ready to go.
And wonderful.
We're going to be responding to you Joker videos today with
a returning guest and a technically returning guest.
You know, these these labels, they get very complicated.
But welcome to the show.
Jay Longbone and that style's girl.
How do you both do?
Hi. Good. Hello.
Is that the way you say hi to everyone?
Hi.
It's usually the way girls say it when they're really drunk.
Hmm. Oh, my brain.
My brain's always drunk on its own chemistry alcohol.
Great idea. No, no.
It's time. It's time.
Yeah, we're almost diverse today.
Still not because three guys, two women.
I've heard from several people, including his wife,
the wise wisdom of Anita Sarkeesian.
This is just not enough wisdom.
Why? Yes. Why is them?
How come it's not called wisdom?
I don't know, man.
That's the failing on them, I suppose.
Have you spoken to them about this?
The whites, just them.
Yeah, whenever people say them, it normally is like the straights or
you're one of the leaders of the white on you, the Jews, or they
were referring to the the the straight triarchy. Oh, no.
Oh, it is.
I know it's because I haven't liked today.
We could probably talk about how Mandalorian
is upset and use Sarkeesian because there were no women in it.
And then she was told there were all of our younger viewers.
You might have to remind them of Anita's.
She looks like an internet.
I guess what's what's like like an urban legend like the feminist Onision.
Yeah. Oh, my God.
Like people know about her.
Like everyone knows about her is like a cautionary tale.
But not everyone can quite remember them back in the heyday.
She was like, yeah, I don't know.
Laughing stock. Any good thing that they've done.
I just because nothing.
We would have spoken about her back in the day with
Macintosh because we would we covered his video.
He used to be her editor, right?
Slash manager. I don't know.
Something with a writer.
Maybe I'm almost positive
she dumped him, which is kind of hilarious.
I should have kept him on by Anita Sarkeesian.
Oh, you weren't a weren't a big enough cuck for Anita Sarkeesian.
I said like she dumped him because he's not diverse enough like himself.
He's too much man.
He needs to be more. He's too man.
Non man. Why?
Too white. He's not.
Well, he's not a man.
He's male. Biologically, he's a male.
I don't know if I'd call him a man.
Just because he said I've seen myself a few few man.
Just because he likes TLJ rags, just because he likes TLJ.
Canada disqualifies him.
Well, it's fucking.
What was his argument?
The TLJ is a film about men looning that they need to listen to women.
What? You know, there should be a scene in the film
where that might be a thing that happens, but I guess not.
Listen to women. Let's get us all killed.
I mean, yeah, I was going to say.
Great idea.
So if if I would listen to Leia in the opening, they'd all be dead.
So not a good idea.
No, but the theme
is listen to women.
The theme trumps all.
Yeah. So we are going to meet.
Like I said, we're going to cover some some movie movie, Mr.
Mr. Movie Blob today.
I thought that it would make sense to start with.
Where is that quote?
Where are? Oh, yeah.
So I guess I should I should mention
he's actually acknowledged everyone.
Mr. Movie Blob himself.
He said, everyone, we made it big.
We've been acknowledged by the big man himself.
Vic, Vic, Mario.
Yeah, he said, the youngest old lady.
Someone was asking, like, would he speak to people on the map?
And he said, I can't imagine why any thinking person
would want to have a conversation which is akin to a dead tree
with two mites flowing out of it.
Yeah, that's funny coming from a guy whose brain is complete mattress filling.
Pretty much, you know, with those rings and air.
Whenever he moves around, which isn't often.
Well, man, depends on the mattress.
I suppose you can get like jelly mattresses, a jelly mattress.
But that thing would like pop beneath him.
Unless the mattress is made out of like literal jelly,
and he just submerges himself in it.
I mean, this sounds comfy, at least, right?
Be the jelly. He's like a water bed.
But a person.
I'm like imagining like this big block of jelly
just sitting in his room and you look inside it and he's just floating inside there.
It's how he sleeps.
Well, Connie, with a chance to meet balls
where he makes the Jello house and they get stuck in it.
Oh, but he would be OK with getting stuck in it.
I think he was asked why he wouldn't go on.
And he said that
he wouldn't want to legitimize what we've said about Jenny Nicholson.
So there you go, folks.
He does not approve of a fact.
It's a shame.
If only we were able to be legitimized by movie, Bob.
And there was like this, you know, several of these kinds of comments
from his fan base being like, oh, my God, this crowd, they're like, debate me, debate me.
It's like, I don't think we've ever said that to Bob Shipman.
Ever. We do not have a desire to debate Bob Shipman.
He can come on if he wants to.
But by goodness, I didn't know anybody had a desire to debate Bob.
Just talk to him and listen to him.
His debate conditions would him would be
inviting you to his house and serving you Mountain Dew.
You'd fucking want to murder us, I think you'd be like, it's for the greater good.
Maybe Bob is the only person on YouTube
who stipulations for a debate would involve catering.
I want to I want to show you folks.
I know Rags would have seen this one, but it's just so funny.
Hey, hey, I'm going to send you guys a tweet.
Who wants to read this out?
Anybody interested?
I shall do it. Read out the tweet.
Yes. OK. Let's see.
Oh, should I try and do it in a Bob Shipman voice
or should I just do it in a regular retard voice?
Dealers choice. OK.
Twenty fucking nineteen.
I was supposed to be on a star ship by now.
And bursting with intelligent robots, deciding what sort of body
I'd like to upload my immortal consciousness to.
Instead, we're all still on this fucking rock,
wondering how to placate the right working class.
I will never forgive the troglodytes who stole the future
I earned to prolong their worthless existence.
Wow, he said this is the thing that would be Bob.
Like he probably bathes every once in a while.
So he has to like see himself and he knows what he looks like.
And he wrote this with that understanding.
Oh, he's white.
He's like ghostly white.
So he's like he's like, you know, in Ghostbusters,
there's the big state puffed marshmallow.
Oh, my God. I'm just about to say that he's lighter than that.
Oh, well, this man gets a lot of sun.
No, I don't think he does.
No, he does not.
He does not get a son.
He's wearing shades.
He must go in the sun, right? You wouldn't wear shades inside, right?
It's, you know, you know.
Vitamin D is a product of the working class white man.
Is he married?
Is there a Mrs. Blob?
Mrs. Chipman.
How could you? It's a great surname.
I imagine it's like cool.
Chipman, I bet he's a chip man.
I bet he loves chips.
Wow, rolling out the fact that he is a man of the chip.
Just because you can't make any arguments against his arguments.
That's why you're doing that.
Just because he could vote twice.
Twice. You assume it's only twice.
Yeah, I was going to say, what the fuck?
Well, you know, if if he could give himself the power,
he would make himself supreme dictator of the universe galaxy.
Oh, I've just gotten a message from fucking discord.
You can claim three months of Xbox Game Pass.
Hey, how about that?
Hey, that's not a bad deal. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we've advocated that before.
It's actually like really good value, but, you know.
Oh, yeah, you can get Gears of War and Jedi Fallen Order
and all sorts of other goodies and video games for your
your console or your computer box.
Basically, all of the things at this point and all the things
if you're looking to get some access to games for the cheapest way,
that's that and like Humble Monthly, probably your best options.
Bumble Huntly, humble.
Oh, yeah. Humble Bundle is amazing.
That's what I that's where I got Vegas from.
Like 20 bucks. Mm hmm.
So, yeah, I mean, I'm not actually, you know, the people.
So we're going to do combine the missing super chats
with the new ones at the end, which means we can kick on to the video.
Is that OK with everybody?
Does anyone want to talk about anything pressing?
Is it? I can't think because it feels weird to me
that we have an intro that's only 20 minutes.
Like that feels wrong, don't it?
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, we could talk about something if you want.
What's been what's been on your mind?
What have you been thinking about?
Literally nothing.
I don't know.
If you think about nothing, doesn't it become something true?
I don't know.
The only thing on my mind is baby Yoda.
And you haven't even seen Mandalorian.
Not a true fan. Hashtag.
You see, that doesn't even know if baby Yoda is
a boy Yoda or a girl Yoda.
Hmm. Maybe this is like you're assuming that it's only a boy or a girl.
Rag. Oh, I'm sorry.
It's I want to be a good trans ally.
I know they're very forgiving bunch.
I don't want to step out of line by assuming baby Yoda is trans.
Yeah, the baby Yoda could be trans identifies as true.
Just by not acknowledging that as a possibility
in any colloquial conversation, I'm oppressing the trans people of the galaxy.
How dare you miss gender, baby Yoda?
It's they them.
Of course. Oh, that's one of you guys heard about this one.
So I saw it on Twitter, Kathleen Kennedy complaining that it's hard
for them to make these sequels because there's no source material to work with.
Yeah, I bet you were.
I bet she works really hard.
Like it's pretty mind blowing.
It's like you deleted the extended universe
and complained that there's nothing to work from.
What the fuck?
It is a fucking thing.
I really want them to adapt Chuck Wendig's novels
because it'll just be such a dumpster fire that it can really be worse
than what we've read in those leaks.
Is it possible? Yes.
It's a Chuck Wendig novel.
He can he can do a real death oochy.
Well, there we we read before the stream began,
Mueller and I watched that Doomcock video he put out an hour and a half,
two hours ago, something like that about these apparently new leaks
that had come out where they were trying to redo a lot of the story stuff.
And it's even worse.
Yeah, it seems like they run. It's bad and worse.
Who do they hire to write this shit?
It's terrible. It's awful.
I hope that Chuck Wendig is like one of the writers.
It would come full circle.
I don't think I'd be able to believe that he'd be able to produce something so poor.
I just also like the idea.
It's like maybe maybe don't do these things if you feel that you have no ideas.
You know, how about that?
Yeah, you could just not buy movies.
You money. Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot about money. That's my bad top.
Fucked up Kathleen Kennedy needs her vaginal tightening reconstruction.
All right. She needs money to pay for that.
She needs to get you think she gets loosened up.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You're freaking wolf out. Stop the game.
And he doesn't like to think about
Kathleen Kennedy's.
Don't say it.
Oh, no.
Natural.
I'm shaven.
Do you think you think she dies?
Do you get a chance ally to work?
Well, you can do this. You can make it.
So you got a shield.
He has to choose your lightsaber colors.
I got to quit before we even get to cinema repair tow.
Lightsaber vibrators, lightsaber vibrators.
Her nether has changed color based on whatever the lightsaber vibrator
set to. It could be yellow, blue.
Why would you go to yellow first?
What's wrong with white, white and beautiful color?
A beautiful woman.
What's wrong with the wrong with the yellow cooch?
No. Oh, my.
How are you doing there, Rags? Are they going good?
Cooch Lee Kennedy.
What? No, no.
So kick rags are drawers, kick rags.
I was just so I mentioned to check the EFAV dot M E site.
There's apparently an EFAV advent calendar.
I have absolutely no idea what this does. Check this out.
Oh, for Krimath.
Yeah, but like I have no idea what it means because like memes.
Well, I don't know. Calendar.
I can't believe you would refer to baby Jesus as a means.
I mean, he's the best mean.
Oh, advent calendar.
Latest updates. Jesus is the greatest meme.
I'm excited to know what's in there, but there's also the vault and the vault.
Yeah.
If you go in there, it's just EFAV 60 is in the vault.
No, no, wait, does he have a copy of it?
No, no.
Well, I'm like the only person I think who can even access it right now.
But everyone can get a copy as soon as I think it's like 12 more days
and it'll be released.
Yeah, it's like it's like the 12th day of Christmas.
I honestly, my own fucking stream back.
Yes, I don't know.
Actually, like this could be anything.
I actually have no idea.
But, you know, keep keep an eye.
We've got so many little things and I got the website, the subreddit,
the obviously the IMDb page we covered last time.
Well, the little communities floating around, connecting and talking
about how T.L.J. is a very good film.
How T.L.J. is a very good film.
You know, it's very productive.
I hope they make another one after T.L.J.
It goes into even more excruciating detail to explain all of the
all of the the open plot lines and questions that were raised in The Last Jedi.
One of the possibilities, Wolf.
Oh, God, it is.
Palpatism survived.
Episode six is that they killed a mere clone of him.
It wasn't him at all.
Yeah, turns out that the triumph it turns out
that the heroes that you thought were really cool and nifty and great.
Turns out they're garbage.
But we've got some cool new characters, like maybe you're in as Vader.
Try them out as we're just dying and talking to Luke.
And then like one of the passing generals is like, by the way,
that wasn't the real Palpatine as he escapes.
They're just like, what?
We did it.
We save the you the galaxy, except we didn't.
Ha ha. Gotcha.
Then Luke six celebrating.
He's like, by the way, we've not really done anything, actually.
With the recon tech like Palpatine not being dead, they're being snoke.
They're being this huge army and the first order just comes back.
It's like, so episode six really didn't do anything then.
Yeah. Like just to clarify, did fuck all.
Oh, you know, people wonder why I'm not a Star Wars fan anymore.
Man, but you know, Palpatine.
Palpatine was my favorite.
I was always rooting for him.
So I'm ready to see him.
I do unironically love Palpatine.
I don't love him being back.
Wow. You're not a true fan.
The true fan wants to see as much of a character as possible.
Even when he sucks.
Yeah. Even when he sucks.
More of him is more is better.
It's like, well, didn't even it's like women.
The more women you get to see, the better it is.
I like women. Do you like women?
You know, Wolf, fuck.
See, they got that silence, bro.
You're back, bro.
All right. Well, anyway, here is the link that y'all going to need
to be able to view the incredible video we're going to start.
I was thinking it's time with Nando, but since he's on topic,
I think movie Bob should be given the stage.
Oh, God.
I mean, he's such a good man.
He killed me last time.
We'll see. We'll see.
Drink plenty of water and killers better like Palpatine.
Oh, wow. Rags, you're the one that's not in you.
What the fuck?
I did. I click it. OK, yeah, here.
It's working now. It's working now.
I click the thing. There you go. All right.
We made it. Oh.
This is Bob after all.
So this is actually a follow up, and I'm pretty sure it's because everyone
was really unsatisfied with his video and he was like, oh,
I better explain what I mean when I say that there's fucking no message in Joker.
So, oh, you're talking. Oh, oh, how how dare he not replace the
O with an asterisk?
Yes, pretty, pretty fucking horrifying to see that word blatantly.
Like we need to really censor that. It's very offensive.
I suggest Joker is Joker actually about anything, if not ham.
He's the Joker. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. The Joker.
Anyway, the Joker, he come for you here.
We got damn diddly dang. Oh, yeah, that's right.
He worked covering a Joker video.
I thought I was in the Star Wars.
You know, true, true.
We'll have plenty of that.
This is the thing we need to take advantage of all the time we have
not talking about Star Wars because, oh, we got we got a whole month.
What do you got a whole month?
And then oh, yeah, that's right.
And then it'll be nothing but three years worth of more Star Wars because
it'll be just it's just going to be awful.
And we can't talk about Mandalorian because that might actually be good.
So why would we talk about good things, poo?
Yeah, we only hate things here in E-frame applause podcast.
It's not like we have one planned in like four days.
It's all about that.
Why would you say that?
Anyway, they could put like they could super chat a shibe.
A shibe? Yeah.
Look at it. A sheeb.
Well, I don't see it. Where are they coming?
A Steve Shibe.
It's in the live chat.
There's like a little there's a little rags that's waving.
I want to see the little rags gimme.
Oh, hold on. I'll skip it.
OK, yeah, do that thing.
Tool is the greatest thing Windows 10 is ever had.
It's lonely.
It's number since the number eight point one.
People wasn't that lonely.
You can't see it being animated because he is way.
He's like actually moving in the super chat.
But there it is.
The sheeb. Yeah, man.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, they added she super chats bafflingly.
You can't send a sheave and a message.
You have to choose between one or the other.
So why they even seem to have their own space. OK.
No, it's very strange.
There is there is incredibly
very selectively competent.
This Google people are.
This is another look.
Pretty cool. They added
that of all things, because they must they must be a fan of eFAB then, right?
Because I don't see how else that could have come along.
Yeah, they've got it.
They've got the sheep for me.
They've got some kind of gas mask creature for me.
Oh, there's multiple of them.
People keep sending them in.
Oh, my goodness. Here, let me.
I don't have to do this on my laptop because it won't work for me.
Otherwise, super sticker.
Oh, there's a peach.
So they have looks like a bum bum.
They've got a they've got a pair, obviously.
Che Longbo.
They totally isn't.
They had an excuse for you to send us more super chats or anything.
Oh, my God. Look at that one.
I don't look at that one.
Who's who's the hippo?
Who's the hippo?
Who's the hippo?
Is it movie bomb?
Is movie bomb the hippo?
Oh, my God.
Hippos are the deadliest animal in Africa.
Could the same be said for a movie, Bob?
Stay tuned to find out.
They don't show up on like make a human thumb.
There's a big bomb.
I end up killing an African on this stream.
They show up on the live chat.
They don't show up in the like video chat, which is the big gay.
But all right. That's stupid.
Oh, my God. It's an Egyptian one.
Oh, like always on a shinobi one. I can't tell.
How did you mistake?
How did you mistake a Japanese outfit for Egyptian?
Because it doesn't look like either of them.
I look like an Egyptian.
Also, it's got like a it's got like party poppers at the bottom of it.
There's a lot of things this could be.
Oh, my goodness.
He's got a little samurai outfit and he's got his flag.
He's got a big heart.
He's squeezing the heart and he's.
He's got his fireworks.
By the way, we're a hateful Nazi podcast.
Can you please read that?
His sparklers.
Yeah, I can't wait for the the Twitter outrage over this.
And then we'll have to link them to this part of the stream.
We're all like a chance.
We're all fording over little teddy bears.
I'm glad we're not trans allies or they'd be down our fucking throats right now.
Over the teddy bears.
I got little little fans.
I love these. These are amazing.
It's weird, though, that
it's so weird.
They wouldn't let you say that one's creepy.
There's a lemon that kisses a heart to you.
Cynic snacks.
What are you what are you doing?
Why is there a lemon person in this world?
Why would cynic snacks be a lemon?
No, he's clearly giving us a lemon person
because he doesn't want it because it's creepy.
Oh, I thought you meant the lemon was cynic snacks.
Mike's very strange to explain.
It's pretty cool.
They made a bunch of emotes
exactly inspired by rags, though, like specifically.
It's pretty cool. I know. That's crazy.
I think that I had to take off my shades for legal reasons. Mm hmm.
Pretty new rule from YouTube like shades or a gateway drug or something.
So every one of the little characters for a super stickers,
they have like a name and a bio.
Right. The bio for the sheep is his name is Bushiva.
All right. Mm hmm.
When Bushiva lost his owner, mail confirmed,
he turned to a life of motorcycles and mischief.
But now he's turning over a cool new leaf.
Motorcycles and Mischief, huh?
Sounds a lot like the Dawn's pet, if you know what I mean.
Oh, my goodness.
Motorcycles and Mischief.
Oh, I can't believe two two wheeled automobiles and sexual harassment.
Oh, my God. Sign me up.
Um, Dream Machine.
Anyway, is to go on the other end of the spectrum entirely.
Who's ready for movie, Bob?
Me, I am not.
I, I can't.
Oh, I don't think you're ready for all this jelly.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, not the jelly.
I ain't jelly about like how it says view at your own risk.
It's so applicable.
View at your own risk.
Oh, God, that's not like speaking to us from the gelatinous cube in his room.
I'm going to be really disappointed.
Oh, yeah, he lives in a jar.
Dancing, lemon bread, more.
The lemon person's very when they're when you know what to do.
Draw the lemon person.
I love. No, not the lemon person.
Draw the cinema Roberto in a giant jelly cube.
Giving out commands through like little
there's going to be little wires connected to his brain
that go outside of the cube into a PC.
Oh, anyway, it makes sense.
Apparently, there's an item in Pokemon Sword and Shield called P.P.
up. That's been an old Pokemon.
P.P. up. Yeah. Yeah.
But yeah, but it's funny now.
It's funny now.
Because I learned about it, which made it funny.
OK. Oh, they get a bottle of P.P.
Frank, this is your last chance.
If you want to leave, it says view at your own risk.
Like this is a serious thing.
Listen. I've got my bottle of P.P. up.
My P.P. is up. I am ready.
Why would you P.P. be a fucking cinema Roberto?
Oh, no, it's so we need to have a time.
No, so that by the time we're done,
my P.P. will be at its normal size because normally it would like shrink into itself.
OK. Fucking up the bottom of my desk, though.
I'm sure you'll take care of that soon enough.
Escapist magazine.
So for those of you who are feeling possibly confused
as to exactly how this month's two a week show schedule works for me.
Fuck. This is the stupid one where he speaks super fast.
This is Bob and his natural habitat.
I don't like it.
He's super fast because he forces me to consider slowing him down.
And that makes it longer.
Is his father the micromachines guy?
What the fuck is he like?
I can't explain this.
I don't know why he does this.
And I always assumed he was just trying to copy Yahtzee
because Yahtzee speaks really fast.
But you can like follow Yahtzee's through line when he speaks with Bob.
You're like, I'm sorry, you just use seven words with eight syllables each.
Oh, actually, his trick is that he says one word at a time
because, of course, he can't speak that fast.
I mean, he's breathing, you know, he's fat.
Even even chat is saying we have to slow him down and then just like puts it together.
I think we did figure out that slowing him down was the way to defeat him.
So I'm going to slow him down a little bit.
I think so, because it's a slow and old movie.
Yes. Yeah.
I think we're going to have that's what we had to do last time,
because movie Bob can take like a word like big,
but he could say it with two syllables.
Big, big, big.
OK, I don't even know. I can't do it.
So for those of you who are feeling
possibly confused as to how this month is to a week.
Oh, shit. It's echoing from Anna's mic, I think.
I don't know. What do I do?
Uh. Yeah.
Two bops for the price of one.
No, it's not the deal we were asking for.
All right. It was getting worse all the time.
We will contract the turbo autism if we have to listen to it twice.
So I guess maybe it's coming through your speakers or.
OK, so how do I fix it so that way it does not do that?
Oh, well, plug your speakers and destroy them.
I will not be able to hear it.
Are you? Wait, so you're listening to all of us three speakers?
Yeah. Oh, I'm surprised it's working as well.
Do you do you have like a like a headset like someone in 2019 might have?
Nope. OK, we've maybe turn.
If the microphone isn't picking us up and you can still hear us,
that means that you could probably turn him down to a degree
where he's not picked up by your thing, but you can still hear him. Right.
Yeah, go to the the watch together and lower, lower the volume on that.
Just lower him as much as you can so that you can still hear him.
But he won't echo. Hopefully that works.
OK, let's try it and let's see if this works. I just did it.
All right. Here we go.
Week show schedule works on Tuesdays.
Regular episodes of The Big Picture on Thursday.
Special Halloween themed episodes for October.
Why are we talking about doing it?
Still like a little bit. Yeah, you still you need to make the blob.
Go away. No, no, no, no, we need blob.
We need the blob.
We need to go away. Beware the blob.
All right, I'll like back up and hold my microphone.
My speakers.
What's what microni using out of curiosity?
A blue snowball.
Is there like a mute button or anything sort of physical or is it?
What do they call it? The yellow snowball?
Yeah, but yeah, like on the on the yeti, that's a sorry.
I'll just mute myself on here when the video plays.
Yeah, sure. That should work.
OK, I think he's just talking about the actual video coming out right now.
Picture on Thursday's special Halloween themed episodes for October.
Why are we talking about Joker again already?
Because I didn't really want to, but I also kind of do anyway.
They're putting some people on the screen.
Hey, man. Wolf thinks those guys are handsome.
Gay confirmed.
Whoa, who likes the big.
Yeah, it slipped out eventually.
Yeah. Everyone put G in chat for gay.
All right. It kind of explains why he hates women so much.
Probably. Yeah.
The gays infamously do hate women.
Yeah, because they can't use their mind control powers on the women.
Hmm. Not so stay tuned for that to anyway.
So distorted.
Just like moving up the.
It also sounds like this theme for like a really fat guy walking.
He's like, oh, oh.
Like he's just saying it's like a private detective.
He's a detective called Joe Hamhock.
There's like a the only thing it's missing is a tuba
When he's in a crime scene, there's like a fucking knife on the floor. He's like, oh, okay. I'm a Neil Rachta
Right nearly at 4 p.m. I can imagine his knees creaking like an old floorboard if he tries to bend
It's like the first detective to operate on a fucking scooter. He's just like
He's just a less attractive Paul Blart
Imagine never movie Bob go swimming like Spain tries to claim him as a new world
He lives in like a like a hobbit house or other doors
Goodness this you'll never talk to us now
His enormous girth he'll never be your friend if he's like tried to sled down a hill
Do you think he just roll and turn into a really big snowball by the bottom?
Yes, can he get white with snow make him wider they make him darker he'd become more of his fated enemy
Detective here I followed
This is a serious
This is a serious podcast very serious
I want to somebody fund producer direct complete the show detective ham hock. I will pay for this
Have him reach Gotham for Batwoman and become here like you're like mentor
This can work in cinema Roberto's favor because he wants diversity and I mean how many like
Heroes, can you think of who have diabetes?
Die a beat. Oh, I can't think of many any
Oh god diabetes. Oh that could be his name
No, no, no, oh my god, oh my god someone draw him like a magneto except he's got
Whereas magneto can control metal diabetes control the sugar
So just keep it as long as you keep them away from like candy stuff
Whatever you saw me I fried it with my family
Oh
Thus seated x2 or he draws the iron out of the blood. He's just drawing sugar out of them
You've been drinking a lot of soda pop
Instead of like a metal helmet he's wearing like a birthday cake or something
Oh, he's wearing one of those helmets that has the like the cans on it you drink. Oh, yeah, like fuck. What are they called?
I don't even know
Weird people hats weird people hats. They can't just drink normally god
Your chicken will not be safe your pizza will not be safe
Your gingerbread houses will not be safe and they are mine to control
Diabetes his sidekick cheeto cheeto
You fucking the diabetic cheetah
Sorry, you haven't even made a point yet
We'll get there. Let's take a moment to appreciate homes gooled
homes gooled, yes
So joker made a bunch of money at the box office over the weekend
Which is being treated as a surprise for purposes of further marketing as though the idea that a movie about probably the second most popular
Character in one of the most popular franchises in the most popular movie genre on the planet for like the last decade of human history
Pulling a big number opening uncontested in early fall is some kind of miraculous
Is he aware of all the superhero movies that have failed?
Yeah
Apparently not like and the big thing about it was he they did it without china's help
How does he explain this? How does he explain justice league?
Like what the fuck dude, we got superman batman wonder woman aquaman flash and cyborg all headlining a movie and it fucking failed
While you'll see it's because it's not
This is this is the equivalent of like he meets us in like battle in fucking gotham and he's like that's different
You can't say this diabido away
But your arguments diabido your arguments
Yes, it was a surprise the joker did this well, uh, I don't think anybody could have predicted it was going to make over a billion
That that's like fucking yeah, that's uh
Definitely a surprise
Um, and and as for the other movies that were competing with joker
What what other movies had kind of came out you know alongside of joker that might have
Uh, you know taken away it's it's movie. Is that part of his point that they didn't have competition?
well, it had
Gemini man
Will smith
Right. Well, I mean
Will smith
True big actor. Well, he's not like biggest movie bob but he's big actor famous, you know, we had adam's family
Yeah
I heard it was the death of cinema apparently
Death of cinema. Oh my goodness brown table said it was the death of cinema
the adam's family
Um, let's see what else what else came out, um
I don't even know
Uh abominable was going out. Yeah, we had abominable. I had some movie about
Um
I guess the abominable snowman like yeti's
like in
Like in the third
Is it the sequel to movie?
Happy feet is the abominable
No big feet or like big foot or something or big feet
No, there was last christmas time that came out with another yeti movie and then
Is abominable?
animated yeti movie
The rule third no, uh, we've got we have small foot we have small foot
Unless okay, there's there's actually been apparently a lot of fucking bigfoot movies recently
I've been aware we have abominable. We have small foot. We have missing link. We have the son of bigfoot
We have mission catmandu and we have chill out scooby-doo, but that was from 2007. So it's probably
I've seen that
Yeah, how is it?
From what I remember it was just okay
Is this okay?
Oh, oh remember uh years and years ago
When they started kind of redoing the the scooby-doo movies you had scooby-doo on zombie island, which was the best
Zombie island was fucking great. Yeah
Zombie island was great. You had zooby scooby-doo
and
Uh, the witch's ghost
The witch's ghost that was pretty good. You had scooby-doo meets the aliens or whatever it was
Oh, yeah, that's the one was a cyber trail or something cyber. Yeah, there was that there was also
Yeah, yeah, there was when they go to australia and there's the vampire like band
Yeah, that was uh, that was actually part of us, uh, which is ghost
They're the hex girls. No, so there's another scooby-doo where they go to australia
and there's like this rock band that's playing but then a
Vampire like when he's in like the bat kind of form comes up and they find out it's just an illusion
But there's an actual vampire
I have no I had no idea
About it came out a few years after so the witch's ghost and the zombie one came out
In the beginning of those series of movies. The one i'm talking about is a little bit like maybe eight years after that
and the curse of the
australian
band
So, oh we're talking about scooby-doo and the legend of the vampire
Yeah, so that's when they go to australia. Yeah, that's that's what I put in
That's what I put into google scooby-doo in the curse of the australian vampire band and there it is
There it is
You just gotta know what to search for the bob chippen celebrated captain marvel for being out the one billion score
As though it's a shock that it's like uh-huh
The film is between the two biggest fucking movies
Yeah
Yeah, shocker
Apparently that is you know surprising but joker a movie that's disconnected from the dceu made by a director with like
No expectation of creating something amazing. I mean, you know, I know a lot of people like the hangover movies
I'm pretty sure I do as well, but nobody was expecting that
Um, how would you not know if you like them or not?
Uh, because i'm pretty sure I do too
Did I say that to the hangover?
Yeah, hangover maybe the first one
Maybe I had a brain fart because I was like, I know I like the first one. I can't remember what I think of the rest of them
So so the second one is where they're in thailand and he gets the tattoo on his face. The one guy gets his finger chopped off
My god
Oh, and yeah, they have to get the monkey that is a drug dealer
Yeah, I don't think I saw it. Oh
Yeah, it's all coming together. Yes ab. Oh, yeah
No, and then the third one is where uh, john goodman is in it
And so he's the one that I guess mr
chow stole all of his gold so they have to go get the rest of the gold from mr
chow's old house and then you find out that the gold was actually
The gold that john goodman already had so they ended up stealing the other half of his gold
And then alan gets married
What do you do you sound like you remember them? How good were they do you think what would you say?
Oh alan i'm glad he was able to get married
Yeah, he gets married to what's her name? Oh my god that uh
Is it heligram mccarthy mccarthy or something melissa mccarthy?
Yes, he gets married to her. I'm so sorry. Oh senator mccarthy
Yeah
Hey, which of the hex girls was your favorite? Which one was wolf wolf? He's abandoned the podcast
Fuck all right mauler
Which of the hex girls would you bone?
Why wouldn't all of them obviously the answer of this question? All of them is obviously the answer. All right
We'll start from the top jay long bone, which of the hex girls would you be on first?
nigga, I ain't watch that shit
Oh, man
No, all right. I watched the original show when I was a kid
I didn't get into all the spin-off stuff and the in the the newer stuff
Hmm. I don't know why this stuff came out in like the early 2000s, right?
I don't know rags you just googled it what years have those come out? Well, let me check the scooby pedia
So like they've given multiple iterations. Thanks. I seem to have got like a game version here and uh
Cartoon yeah, so there's the cyberspace one
So that's the one where they go through different like levels of cyberspace through the video game and because they're at a carnival
I you know, I shouldn't put google on screen. Who knows what's going to come up. I better be careful
Yeah, they they they they appeared in scooby-doo and the witch's ghost they were in scooby-doo and the legend of the vampire
They were also in what's new scooby-doo and uh,
Yeah, they they made some appearances here
Yes, because they were so popular. Oh, yeah, absolutely. Did you watch the ones where it was just scooby shaggy and scrappy?
um, oh the old ones
Well, they had the boo brothers and they had the one where they were teaching like the monsters
So all the like scary monsters from movies. Yeah, I know what you're talking about
Yeah, the problem is that scrappy's a little fucking cunt and it was really hard for even like a child
They made it up with scrappy. They made him a villa to the movie didn't they because they're like people hate scrappy, dude
They did absolutely because scrappy's a little asshole. I don't know. I like scrappy
You could have you could have a you could have a lake of
Acid and scrappy would be like i'm gonna go beat the fucking acid up
It's so cute because it's uh shaggy just picked him up because he's so little and he's like trying to punch him and just like
Hands are moving his little legs are moving, but he can't like touch anything because he's getting held up
It's so cute. Don't you just appreciate the spirit of em rags the spirit the spirit of the spirit of scrappy
I I wish he was just a spirit
Wow scrappy's the kind of nigga who'll slap your girl on the ass in the club and then be like it's so good
Girl's ass in the club. That's that's that is
Typical scrappy scrappy behavior scrappy
Then he just punt him out the front door because he's a small thing
Because he's small and he's nifty. Yeah, so um
Well, what are we thinking what are you thinking anna we thinking thorn dusk or luna who's going first
For what for who?
Okay
Which what of the three members of the hex girls? Who'd you bone first?
um
None because they're not men. Oh my god. That's so sad. I'm not being you're not being trans ally
I'm sorry
Not attracted to women
matt mauler
I'm going for the black
Um, not if not i'm gonna base it on hair pretty much. I like the black hair
Who's got black hair?
The middle one torn. No, it's like dark red
It is black, but it has like a red highlight to it
It's like whenever it looks black, but whenever the the sunlight hits it you can tell like oh that is that's really dark red
It's like blood red
Well, that's a trick that they used in animation is so that if your character has like a
You know black hair like even like a black mask
They put like a highlight on it
So that way you can see the character against the background and especially when the backgrounds are going to be night
So that's why she has the the red
Oh
Yeah, well the two of them have the red then because there was orange blossom
Luna is her name the keyboarder person lady keyboard person
I don't want to I don't want to say keyboardman. That's
Very rude the keyboard the keyboardists the penis. Yes
So movie bob
Now that we've settled
Wait, what was your choice rags? What was your choice?
Oh, i'm absolutely fucking thorn first. All right. Yeah, okay
I'm glad that was important. Bob. You may continue now
Eight of human history pulling a big number opening
uncontested in early fall is some kind of miraculous unexpected victory for the film and its fans against the overwhelming adversary of
Marginally divided reviews from professional critics and so
It's pretty underselling it a little with how this movie was covered by the media
Yeah, it was down to like 50 something
Originally not to mention just the headlines
They were like trying to kill that movie before it even came out saying oh don't go to the
You're gonna get shot if you go to a theater and watch this movie
Yeah, we covered jenny nickels and she was like I didn't go to a normal theater
I went to drive in theater to improve my survival odds
Okay, you know what? I actually don't believe her on that because she and I you don't
Here's the thing rags. She and I live relatively close together and me and my friend sav
We like to go to drive-ins, but hey, guess what? There's none down here and I was like, huh
She went to go see joker. Let me let me go through and find all the drive-ins around me and what days they were out
Her evidence, uh, it's not lining up. It's not
no
There was a good chance. She made it up on the spot to be like look how like I did that
Evidence of like the quick I guess and then when she was called out how much it doesn't make sense. She was just like, uh
No, like
He's levitating marshmallows
Oh
Are those marshmallows or chiclets?
I thought they were sugar cubes. Yeah, I thought they were cubes for a second there
Uh, are they not I can't tell very well in this picture. Oh, it's perfect
Do I like my robe
It's
He's looking pretty good there like he's lost a lot of weight good stuff bob
He wears the he wears the shades under the mask I guess
Do you think it's hard to fit them under there
I think so
So what what is what is cinema Roberto said so far?
Oh, you missed him saying that it was no shock. This movie did well because it's a part of a big franchise
So why is everyone raving about that?
Why is everyone raving about the fact that I did well
Um, because we know what i'll just play it again like you bob. We'll get wolf's take on this. All right, get ready wolf
So joker made a bunch of money at the box office over the weekend
Which is being treated as a surprise for purposes of further marketing as though the idea that a movie about probably the second
Most popular character and one of the most popular franchises in the most popular movie genre on the planet for like the last decade of human history
pulling a big number opening
uncontested in early fall is some kind of miraculous unexpected victory for the film and its fans against the overwhelming adversary of
marginally
Go ahead. Okay, pop. Let me let me try to explain this to you in a way that your small mind can possibly understand
It is a shock that a movie that is not attached to the dceu as it currently stands
A movie made by the guy who is known for making the hangover films and a movie that is rated r has done this well
That's why it's a surprise not because it's a superhero movie
but because it's completely detached from the current superhero movies made by a guy who really
You know one would ever think he'd make a good superhero movie and it's rated r and it
I mean it broke the record for a
lot of records
Which is pretty much the most objective evidence we can have in terms of it doing better than expected. It's beating out records
I'm just glad it's I wasn't surprised at all by it. I watched the trailer and I was like
This is going to be a really good movie. It's probably going to make a lot of money
I
Can't say I was I was expecting to do. Okay because it wasn't attached to anything and it was just this movie about
A character that they're calling joker
And it's like I didn't know how good it was going to be
Um, yeah, just a small that by the way, do you hear that he said the second most popular character in the franchise
He's referring to batman being more popular. So how does he explain justice league? I will keep coming back to that
I mean isn't like the whole appeal of the dark knight being the joker like no one talks about batman in that movie
Yes, because even christian bale has regrets about his portrayal of batman in that movie. It's just like batman's fine in that movie
And that's kind of almost what you could call an issue. It's like he's not
Maybe it's like it's a lot of people talk about whether or not it's batman or bruce wayne. That's boring
Um or both or not boring but not interesting enough
I don't know if it's just hard to be interesting when you're acting alongside someone like heath ledger as joker
Can be tough
Well that one dude did it in the knight's tale
Yeah
He's not the joker in that he's a completely different character there were
At the point you guys
Chat backed me up a knight's tale
Yeah, it's a good film. But what are you talking about?
Well, you're you're like it's hard to
You were you were like, hey, it's hard to stand out when you're next to heath ledger, but I was like, oh, yeah
Well, what about the guy specified heath ledgers joker you you disingenuous?
Person no heath ledger. He played kind of a joker character. He told some jokes in that
Rags you're not appreciating. You're not appreciating stay puff bob
On
Orkvaughn Lichtenstein
It looks exactly like it
We are becoming
Or is that just his cheekbones
I don't we this is forever
We don't know my theory was that he had a horrible accident where his face was stretched open and the surgery couldn't fix it all
Do you think this has like a puffer fish and like when he's like not angry his face like sucks in on itself?
Oh, it could be um, I think it's weird that someone who's so
Large has cheekbones like that. That's the thing. I don't know what's going on there
I think they're dimples because when you get older like with your dimples
I noticed that especially on men is they kind of become wrinkles that are just lines in your cheeks like that
Like what's the guy from game of thrones that? Uh
Catlin's brother heath ledger. No
Smaller game of thrones catlin's brother. Well, I know this one
Uh, the the dude who was useless and everything. Yeah
The one that admir kali so he I I you know
He's got the lines on his face on his cheeks and all his I realized i'm like, okay
So he had dimples and that that's the wrinkles from his dimples. So that's kind of like movie bop here
So I think he just has dimples
Yeah, as as nathan t just highlighted he's both fat and gaunt it's very odd
He is font one of his dimples could pass as a swimming pool
No, don't say that just because he probably sweats a lot
Why would you even suggest that I can't believe you would say that on national television
No one assumed that until you said something
global
Saturation if you're going to say that you have to put on the accent
Do it crass crass
No, yeah crass yes complete global saturation
Resi well five is terrible. It's so great. How terrible it is
It kind of is it really it's a special tism
Okay
Hey, let's see what he has to say about joker. Okay, let's do it. I'm glad that I made a lot of money
As am I i'm fucking it's the fucking one crumb of hope we got in this terrible year of movies
Cress crass the one crumb of hope
It made a lot of money crass
Auroboros joker crass
What is the hex girl question, I don't know what that means
All right, let's get up do it
All right. I'm glad i'm glad that you're here again. Wolf. It's good. We're glad to have you back
So are you familiar with the hex girls?
No, well, let me tell you
So are you familiar with scooby-doo and the witch's ghost?
No, you're like jay. You haven't seen anything. You haven't seen any real films. You haven't seen any real films
I haven't seen a scooby-doo movie since I was like 10
scooby-doo
and the witch's ghost came out way back in like
2000 something like that long tisms ago
Now there's a band of vampire ladies, but they weren't really vampires, but they thought they were vampires. They're witches called the hex girl
They're they're they're wiccans
wiccans
Right
Part of this group
She doesn't play in the musical instrument in the band there's only three girls
But this one time a band camp she did
Well, uh foreign just get a little that's some deep referencing we've just done there. I like it
I'll get you a picture of the hex girls here and you can tell me which one you want to bone first
Why did you say that like a ball mischievous voice?
21
Why would you mischievous fucking greasy as hell? I know right
Tell me which one you'd bone Chris
Rock star ladies pretending to be witches, you know, like all right, it's so greasy. You want to bone them
All right, so that those are the hex girls
Definitely not the one on the left. She looks like she has autism. I know she's like better from the well, it's a bad analogy
Stay away from that comparison
This uh, I gotta I gotta go with a hard middle the middle hard middle hard for the middle. I agree
I think the chicken that's thorn
Right. Oh my god. She has the edgiest name. I think i've heard
Yeah
Thorn, but what are the other two names again?
dusk and luna
I'm guessing dusk is the retard
Dusk is the retard
The one on the left
Oh my goodness
We can't say that the so luna is the pianist whoa get it out of your system get out of your system
Come around
Luna's on the right that's luna
Dusk is on the left because she's often
left
in the
dust
Yeah, the dusk
She she's bite. She bites the dusk whenever all the the boys come around because they're like, how did we get on this exactly?
We were talking about scrappy rags is a big no
I don't actually know how we got to talking about this. Should we let bob make another point? I'm curious where he's gonna go with this
Okay, fine
He already made one that was really wrong. He's he's one for one zero for one
Maths like it depends. I don't know this one's like meh. This one's a
Like it's like a non-point sort of
Like I guess some people were really surprised
He's doing the thing where it's like you shouldn't even be shocked by this and it's like
Anyone could be shocked for any fucking reason. There's plenty of reason to be shocked by this
I'm not sure send some scattering overhyping of random concern trolling in the national media
I'm deflated
A fitting end for you joker. Oh, no jokers. Oh, that's wonderful editing
Become diabetes become diabetes. Hey, it means that he knows his shit. He's referencing the old stuff. That's true
They were called people are telling me to adjust my settings so that way the microphone only picks up me in discord
I don't know how to do that though
um
Whatever you need to do might be something that ends up being a little bit too complicated for now
Like whatever you've been doing from now is just is working. So
Could you hear it this last time?
I don't think so, but if we do we'll be like, you know
Okay, because I just put my hands over the microphone
All right, then
Damn it, um, anna you're familiar with this this scooby-doo movie then
Is this person in the chat telling the truth when they say fun fact fact dusk tried to hook up with the dog
What dog scooby-doo scooby-doo
No, the the other dog in the show
There are other dogs are scrappy dudes. I was gonna say there is the labrador from the space one alien
And yeah, fred's fucking hot heading scooby, but they don't try to hook up with him unless it happens in
The one where scooby gets turned into a man
But
Oh my goodness, I have to look up scooby-doo as a human. Oh my god
Don't quote me on that. I'd have to go back and watch them
but the reason why these are all so fresh in my memory is because
My stepdaughter has been watching, you know crappy tv show. So i'm like, no you're gonna get something
Yeah, hence we saying oh
Oh my god, he looks like he looks like he looks like a jewish
He looks like a what?
a jewish penis
I just spit out my juice all over me
Oh, why you're the one who brought it up didn't you already have a mental image in your head?
That's a nose right there. He could he could drive that through the walls
He can sniff a shekel 10 miles away
I can almost feel ben shapiro blushing
I'm a to be fair efap. We are friends of all the jewish people
Including scooby-doo these nasty terrible jokes that they're telling about this is scooby-doo
His ethnicity is dog. I don't know what you want
Why does he they gave him a brown t-shirt I guess
Well, yeah, so he's got a really fucked up face
And he has one big too yes, he has a brown shirt yes
Where's this yarmulke?
All right, it's it's there. It's just hidden by the hair
You know, what's cool is that you guys didn't know that this image existed before and it was awesome
Being here to experience your guys's introduction to scooby-doo as a man. Oh my goodness
I didn't know that scooby-doo is actually a person
He had a terrible accident with a transmogrifier
I was gonna say the horrible reveal that this is a prequel episode before he got turned into a dog
And he just he's been begging for help this whole time. He just can't get it out
Did you guys ever watch the show where there were teenagers?
And so it's scooby and shaggy when like scooby's a puppy puppy and shaggy's a teenager and he has
Scooby's dog house in the backyard. That's actually like a mansion underground
Can I oh that's that's a pup named scooby-doo, right? Yeah
Yeah, that show is garbage
No, it's it's a dumb show the show is dumb and
Fred maybe Fred into it idiot. I'm sorry someone in the chat called him scooby-doo
Oh, no, why would you say that? Oh my god?
Scooby-doo to the master race
Don't even what is that even a parody off?
Oh, no, we're gonna we're gonna get a bunch of people doing the scooby-doo titles now. Oh, no
I didn't like this joke or have this happen
Fred an idiot and they made velma insanely smart and she did everything because she's
So smart and she just is insufferable
Wow rags intelligent women made fred an idiot. Yeah, I do
Well, that's why I fucked the horn when I watched it well, I haven't seen it since it came out on cartoon network
Back in the day remember on cartoon network. No, no, no, no, we're not gonna get into a tangent
Count chicken. So let's go and let's talk the last thing we want to do is get onto a tangent
Oh
Sorry about this
Which you may recall turned bizarrely political when director todd phillips
Previously best known for road trip the hangover trilogy and the feature adaptation of star ski and hutch
stated that his making the film was inspired by traditional comedy having been
Killed by quote unquote woke culture and laid up in the negative reviews on the far left. So there's a certain
You know when you showed me that clip from earlier in the video
I noticed that like slowing him down you realize he mispronounces like every third word he does
Is I don't know how to explain it a lot of people say it's his boston accent slipping in i'm just like I think oh
He's from boston. This actually makes sense. Yeah
At least that's what i've been told
Um, yeah, uh, I don't know I think the I don't I don't find those comments to be unfair. Um
The idea that he's like I don't want to do comedy anymore because it's too difficult to actually tell a lot of
Different jokes because you'll get in trouble for them. It's like yeah, you went to drama
I mean wasn't he proven right after the show after the after the movie was released. Anyway, like oh, there's gonna be shootings
Yeah, I mean the people who are missing with fucking reason it was offensive
Let's let's see. What Roberto's got to say about how wrong he is saying
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's happening?
Oh my goodness
Oh
He's so comfy in his gelatinous cute
This looks like a new out style as well i'm assuming this isn't from baywood or anything
No, it's uh, it's from uh, let me commissioner minic
Oh, no, oh no. Oh no. Oh, there's another one. Well, if you're scaring me what's happening
Oh my goodness, eat a carrot you fat bastard
This is name your name is streambot eating carrot you fat
Efap episode 60 whatever you think
Oh my goodness don't
but
What movie you realize we're gonna be on tajas for so many hours. He's gonna tweet out apparently this efap podcast made a 10-hour video
about me
And this time it'll be true
Oh shit covered him before in his opinions or shit. We're just here for the lulz at this point
We're not sexist we're fattest. Yes
We're ableist because we prefer people who are able to move
Yeah healthy at all sizes you fucking bigots
We're mobilists. We we give privilege to those who are mobile
That's the point though that so cruel the point though that movie bob is gonna make here
Is movie bob is gonna try and say that oh, no, no, no, no woke cancel culture. That's not a thing
I mean not everyone is not literally everyone is cancelled. Not literally everything is is turned away
Not everyone's getting fired. We're not trying to ruin everyone's life. Therefore this guy's concerns about cancel culture are super dumb
I mean, it wasn't boy. It was back in like mid-september, right?
You had that new comedian who was hired for snl as a writer and then he got fired because he said homophobic
kings did his podcast and stuff like that
And I fucking hate people people who say cancel culture is the thing but their life didn't get ended like that's not the fucking
You fucking idiot like yeah cancel culture is like the fact that people accept
To accept the behavior of ruining people's lives over little shit. That's what it is. It doesn't matter if it doesn't
Follow through it doesn't matter if you lose anything or not
It's the fact that you think it's fucking appropriate to call someone's fucking job
And tell them and show them their facebook and it's like some shit. They said in 2008 and get them fired over that
That's the problem. That's oh god
They've never heard of people like count dankula
Absolutely
No, uninsul the uninsuline diabeto
I mean how often is it that somebody says something?
And oh no
Here come the twitter mobs and here come the articles and here come the protests and here come the news
Letter-writing campaigns gotta get this person fired. Oh, you can't allow this person to speak here
You can't allow this person to have a talk here
You can't know they can't be here because they tell meanie jokes and it offends people
Like fuck off bob if you're gonna try and let the world know that it's totally
That's not a real thing guys, even though you hear about it happening all the fucking time. It's not real
It's just it's just all right lies
It doesn't happen to me. No one takes away my honey ham
Like they do these shoots these marshmallows at you at high speeds they go through you
He's just like die nazi
Well to be fair I haven't been killed by anything I guess but no I haven't been killed by a marshmallow
All right. So anyway, he has a video
His video the hangover trilogy and the feature adaptation of star ski and hutch stated that his making the film was inspired by traditional comedy
Having been killed by quote unquote woke culture and laid up in the negative reviews on the far left
So there's a certain irony in one of his film's most passionate defenders turning out to be left-wing activist and documentarian provocateur
Michael more of all people another person. No, no, you see
If i'm if I am critical of one side of the political spectrum
And somebody from that side defends my movie that means that my argument's bad
Because it's literally all or fucking nothing in the mind of the sjw's and movie bob. See michael more
He liked joker. So that means that all of uh, all of his criticism. It doesn't count
Pretty sure there'll be a shit ton of people from all over the spectrum. We like joker because joker's not fucking
But we already know this
um
But but the people who really hated it. There's a good chance
We know where they line up. Uh
Typically and there's nothing wrong with hating a movie. It's fine
But I think the todd was probably right
And the whether or not michael more likes the movie doesn't really take away from his point
but uh, all bob said was that it's ironic for uh
uh
from uh fucking
More to be the one
I don't know who michael more is. Can you guys tell me who this person is?
No, you don't want to know
Documentarian is probably what he'd want to be known as
About what? What did he make a documentary on? Uh, lots of different like issues in general
I've not actually watched any of his documentaries. So
But um he's in team america
The only thing you need to know is that he's really fat
Okay
Really fat unfortunately from the same thing as me. He is michael more. He should be michael less
Nice you did a rex
Yeah, fucking slid that yeah
Slid that in like a side of bacon
Boom
Grease that pickup and slid it
Screening of the film at the new york film festival to declare that he had witnessed a cinematic master
Oh how fucking painful must that be for bob?
To have michael more say that it's a masterpiece. Damn
Can you just tell us about the movie though? No get the politics stuff done. This is this is bob
This is probably just like the the fucking
It's gonna be halfway through he probably talks about the movie
Peace and that contrary to the supposed societal dangers posed by the film the greater danger to society
Maybe if you don't go to see this movie because the story it tells and the issues it raises are so profound
So necessary that if you look away from the genius of this work of art you will miss the holy shit
Michael more really did like this film
Wow, michael moore really did like it. Wow
Yeah
Gift of the mirror it is offering us in a subsequent post more with further
It's like you don't do that shit on purpose
Is it not hilarious that a fat guy is making a fat joke about somebody else who's not as fast?
If he was anti-joker, I don't think bob would have pulled this picture up would he?
Fuck no
Uh, but yeah, it's still pretty funny because we were just talking about the team miracle. Yeah, there he is
Relaborate joker makes it clear
We don't really want to get to the bottom of this or to try to understand why innocent people turn into jokers after they
Can no longer keep it together?
No one wants to ask why two smart boys skipped their fourth hour ap french philosophy class at column
So the echoes are a little loud. Yes, it's like yeah
Okay, i'll move it away
Fine hi to slaughter 12 students and a teacher. No one would dare ask why the
Oh
Yeah, mike i'm gonna cut you off right there because yeah, we actually do know why the two kids at column
Do tell us. Oh god did it because they made videos and wrote it down in journals beforehand
The fucking
Is the whole that gives you the whole picture you dumb shit
So
As evidenced by their writings, so I can't believe we're on this topic. Holy shit
But all right
This is a movie bar video as evidenced by their writings homemade videos and other materials recovered after the 1999 column by massacre
Shooters eric harris and dylan kellbold were known racists with interest in white supremacy
And neo-nazi ideology who specifically targeted minority and fit. I thought uh
I thought maul's point was how did they get to that point?
But
So, okay, yeah just to clarify right so michael maul says we need to check out joker and take it seriously as an example of how people become
jokers and um
He referenced the combine shooters like how did they get to be who they were?
And then thingy's rebuttal is they a white supremacist racist neo-nazis
And it's like yeah, okay, like assuming that's true because I don't know anything about this, but when you want to know how that happened
Yeah, right there's there's like, you don't fall in a nazi, right? I didn't I have a chance
Um, okay
apparently
Uh, both of the killers had radically were radically different individuals with vastly different motives and opposite mental conditions
um
Hot-headed depressive suicidal blaming yourself for problems one of those challenge. Um
Uh
Psychiatric problem
uh
because I just
I just googled this here and it's it's coming up with all sorts of other stuff, but okay
sure
Let me control f nazi
Doesn't show up. Let me control f
white
Doesn't come up. Well, maybe this is just a
Bad article who knows I mean, I just I don't know like in the spirit of the of the argument here
I'm not even looking at the details. I figured that moore's point was more. So how do these people get created in the first place?
I don't know
Yeah, uh, it seems really weird that we're talking about this in a I gotta yeah
Anybody who's just joined the stream. This is a joker review. Uh,
I know it's like we haven't even talked about it
Forgot to talk about us good on tangents at least I was involved scooby-doo
I mean implication here that like well, this is what causes they were racist boom done like
okay, so anyone
like taking out mental illness like anyone could kill someone just because they have like
Radical like views like not everyone who has radical
Who views like nazis and whatever is gonna go out and kill sometimes. They're just assholes
Sometimes they're just they just have poison. They're just a toxic person
toxic non-violent person
You know, right
like it's like oh
the renaissance
cause of everything see
like
like you gotta think about this shit because like
You got you also have to think about people who read the koran and like and follow it to the letter and don't
and
You know, it's like they they're who are really
like repressive of
The people around them because of what they believe like, but they're not violent
And they're not they don't do go out and do crazy shit. They're just they're just kind of assholes
Yeah, you got a whole fucking spectrum of this shit
And I mean you guys you guys remember back in 2017
Um, you guys know, uh
Uh the year that the last jedi came out. No, yeah, you guys remember forever. Shall it be known?
he and uh
He and he and four other people were shot. Uh steve's cases of the u.s. Um, the republican congressman. He was shot by uh,
a
Really big bernie supporter, right?
Now that that shit right there. Oh, man, I bet a lot of you don't remember that happened
But remember that that did happen
but oh if
It just whenever it seems like one of the sides do it. It's always downplayed hush. Hush. Don't talk about it
It's not a big deal. Don't worry about it. But man, we gotta dig up every little thing we can get on the other side
It's just just something just something like this, but I don't forget
Problem is this is weird to bring up in a fucking joker video
Yeah, and you might be like, what do you mean? He had to because michael morders like you brought up michael mordel like why?
Movie bob is like super political and everything is through the lens of social justice and class warfare and eugenics and shit like that
so movie bob has got to find a way to
Like this movie
He's got to find a way to
Put his ideology into all this stuff that he does even if it's a movie review gotta find a way
Everything in that description. You just gave him this dude
As to why joker is a good film
He's got a following to pander to that's what I gotta show everyone that nazis are bad he's like, yeah, we know but there are
nazis
I mean you could bear he could very easily push the narrative white man bad with um, oh my god thomas wayne
And look what the rich white man did to the poor guy that had mental illness and look what it did
And look how it just destroys society. We need to you know, destroy the patriarchy and all the white men
He could totally use that narrative
As being a positive for this, but he doesn't
The joker wasn't black though. He wasn't female so
Don't count
Genuinely, it's the joker was black the discourse would be completely different
Oh, absolutely. It would be
Insane you can't just you can't just flip a flip a race like that and I have it mean the same thing. It should it should
Right, but it not anymore. Everything's got to be dare. I say it colored in something. That's
It's deep and symbolic or it
Things can't just be what they are, right?
So is he offended that the
Well, well this is well in the first video that we covered from movie bob he was talking about joker
he said that basically all of uh, all of the the white male problem that
Arthur has in the film are the result of a woman
Right
It's like the film was essentially saying that the cause of all your problems are it's all because of a woman, right?
um
It's just these these wild wild takes like how tyt
Said that you know joker has a problem with black women, right?
they just
these insane huge galaxy brain level takes that you just can't you wouldn't have even
Thought of they wouldn't have entered into your mind at all, but they just they just pull them out
and I think one of the reasons why a lot of
Especially left-leaning people seem to not like the joker, right?
Is because the joker skirts really close to that line talking about the rich or evil
And normal people are just are oppressed and it just pushes that and there's nothing bad about the other side, right?
Joker teaches us that the misunderstandings come from both sides and that even if you're if you're on the bottom
You're on the top no matter which side of the economic, you know ladder you're on not ladder which the scale you're on
Things, you know, you can take things too far and you can do bad stuff and just you know
Not everything is excused because of you know, that kind of situation
But the movie very easily could have been changed
To where it clearly portrayed one side as being the bad guys and the other side is obviously being totally the victims
And I think that they're kind of uh resentful of the fact that it didn't do that
That joker could have been a very very popular film that portrayed the kind of thing that they wanted to see but it didn't
And so you end up with reviews when they talk about michael moor
All right
um, but I mean it's it's bob's take the there's nothing to say about this film so
Like I guess this is tying into that idea that he's just like, I don't know if I can i'm just
Just talking about what I can because there's just this film's nothing bigger, but you know, I guess
To make his point which doesn't make sense. I mean he hyper targeted like I said, this is just inappropriate
But you know fine. This is what he wants to talk about
I guess what happens next
Ken in the irony of him an irony of the second paragraph here
Uh subsequently also ignored by michael moor's film bowling for columbine
Which instead redirected focus to the political and economic issues that are the focus of most of moor's other films jeez
No self-awareness there bob
Oh, I know who this person is now
But the bowling for something movies. Yeah
I never watched them, but I I know the cover
I'm waiting for it to continue
But anyway, the fact that I was overwhelmingly certain that joker was not in fact about the things michael moor was describing to it
in any meaningful way the oh
So mr. Subjective just said someone else's meaning they drew out of it isn't actually there
Strong
I like this is this is part. I get really fascinated right because we lay out this sort of
Framework and they they'll come at us with like not fucking nonsense. It's all subjective
You cannot deny someone else's experience in the same fucking breath. You have people like movie bobby and like
The film isn't remotely about what he thinks it's about. It's like oh
Okay
Interesting. Yeah, simple as that man. It really bothers me. She's so fucking hypocritical
But all right, because he said it with any in any meaningful way as well
Like i'm sorry, you can just define the amount of meaning is in a thing now
Sure
In fact about the things michael moor was ascribing to it in any meaningful way those of you who've seen my review of the film
Of course know that I was not a fan for me only served to highlight one of its most curious
Qualities that it's a film comprised almost entirely of surface level texture aesthetics visual cues needle drops soundtrack auditory mood notes
allusions to contemporary social topics and politics
But with all of them decoupled from any inherent meaning that they typically possess and none of it unified by any cohesive theme
That was a long
Sentence
Again if breathing wasn't a reflex people like him would be dead what the fuck are you making me watch mauler look he
I'm trying to think about how I can condense this for him. So
every element of the filmmaking
That's not the writing but also including the references to political
Question mark like stuff. I don't know all of it isn't tied together in any meaningful way. I think that's what he said
Oh sweetie does
um
All by the way surface level texture, uh
duh
Oh, I know what you mean. Yeah, but I also I just find it amusing because like it's kind of how I feel about tlj
I'm like, oh, yeah, it's pretty much all surface
But he would be like no the flames
I
Guess it's just the fact that joker is it's so simple
Really? It's offensively simple rags
Offensively simple. It's like how come everyone gets this but the galaxy brains on youtube?
How did this guy become popular like what was the video that did that maybe he got in
I'm not even convinced we can classify him as popular anymore. Like what kind of view count does he get on these videos?
Let's have a look. Let me take a look
People are subscribing this guy and listen and watch his content. Yeah, this this is 61k views and he's sharing the platform with yatsi
Yeah, this is escapist. So he's on a channel with 1.15 subs
but
What about his channel does he have a channel?
Yeah, he does. Okay
Hmm
He's my brain already. He's pulling between 10 and 15k
on each video
Yeah, i'm pretty sure this is evidence of him having I think he sank popular in popularity
So i'm pretty sure he's more popular than that once upon a time
his last video is um
Martin's martin scorsese versus himself. Let's stop talking about real cinema
seven hours 11 000 views
So
Oh
Wait, he made a seven hour video. I think it's less so that he's super popular. Mostly he just never goes away
He's like the creature of the internet that was and he never changed
How many times he comes back
I was gonna say that
You have to like just cut their head off and like destroy it and then they still grow another head
because he's been
Making videos that look exactly like this for a long time like as long as I can even remember it being on the internet
He hasn't evolved like at all. He's literally nothing critic
Well, he's like he's the quintessential example of being stuck being caked inside your own point of view where you can't possibly
Fucking evolve it. No, that's actually that's actually cake. He's trapped in cake. Oh, I thought it was a gelatinous cube
He is
The last jedi, but he doesn't find any meaning in the joker. Are you fucking shitting me? Yeah, that's the crazy
well, this is the thing like we we have this
Fascinating arc on our show where we had to deal with all the tlj stuff
And now again so many of the regulars who love tlj not getting joker and it's like what happened to you guys like what?
She's like why why didn't you use that shovel that you use to dig 30 feet down into the dirt to just squeeze those
Themes out of the last jedi and twist that film into trying to be meaningful and to make sense
Oh, we can do that. No problem, but yeah with obvious stuff like joker. They can't do it
Yeah, tlj was made by a fat neck idiot for fat neck idiots like this
like capital like
Because I guess like there's certain themes in that movie that aligns with their
their
Political beliefs and I guess that's all they need to like for that to be a good movie like oh
capitalism bad, you know canto bite
Bullshit that shit
That's all I mean
Failure is the greatest teacher. Okay
It just seems like with the last jedi is everything it's just like it's so
Shoved down your throat in your face like capitalism bad animal rights. Let's abandon the orphans
But with the joker, it's like this guy has a hard life. He has a hard day. He goes to work
He comes home. He takes care of his mom
He doesn't get to do the things that he wants to do and then finally when he does it's all the bad stuff
And it's just like this guy just had a bad day after a bad day after a bad day
And he had to work hard and nothing paid off
Nothing was handed to him like the how it was with ray like it was with rose like fin
Everything just gets handed to those people even when shit doesn't go right for them
They still end out on top where as joker he ends out on top
But you know the world's burning around them and I think all these people they just haven't had a hard day
they just don't understand the concept of
shit gets bad sometimes and you have to deal with it like a fucking grown-up and they don't understand that and I
Blows my mind how stupid and naive people are about real life issues
Genuinely why we have trouble associating with characters that don't experience any trouble. We'll just sit there like wow
That must have been nice
It blows my fucking mind how just people like this exist
Anyway
It was difficult to get over that sentence bob fire the next one at us
Unified by any cohesive theme in other words a movie that in certain key points looks or feels like it has something to say
Or might even be about something but in fact
Joker's not about anything
I like how he said it might be about something like wow
So generous
Could you imagine movie bob trying to do what the joker did running after those kids he would probably
You actually have to stop as soon as you say the word running I was gonna say beyond his little scooter
He'd be like stop right there imagine him rolling maybe
You you have leg privilege
Oh my god, can you imagine bob rolling like like the what are those stupid things in the prequels called? Um
the the droids that roll
Oh
Destroyers. Oh, yeah the droid because yeah, like could you imagine if he was rolling around like a droideca after after the kid?
See
I was picturing him on the on the scooter because the kids then shove the the side into the wheel of the scooter and it
Cracks and it just falls over. He's like, oh, no
Tilt until he falls and then the camera pans out and he's just on the floor crying like why me?
I'm sorry. I'm just imagining instead of joker. It's just bob
The the only thing in my head is like movie bob like seeing people steal his things
And then he like folds up and starts rolling after them with the terminator theme in the background
If your heart is breaking eat
Even though your arm is quaking
Yeah in your artery I feel like maybe he would like this movie if we if we get it made
What do you say bob?
We're not exactly interested in funding it but we support you funding it
I want to see bobbert do it. Come on
And then in the trailer you have like morgan freeman or some just famous voice being like what makes a man a movie bob?
Uh
Morgan freeman narrating movie bob's life
Uh, it could be just like can be just like march of the penguins, but with a lot more fat march of the pop
March of the bobbins
Bob drinks his coffee with twizzlers
I'm not one to judge
Oh my god, maybe you should lay off the sugar bob
I can't imagine morgan freeman just having a snarky ass commentary over the whole thing
No, it reminds me did you guys watch the office
Uh, which one american steve girl
I've seen a couple of episodes. I haven't seen the whole thing
Oh, you haven't come on guys. There's this one episode where he it's a
Continuous thing that he's been filming his like secret agent movie for like 11 years
So on the last season that he's on it
He finally is showing everyone the movie and so he has the black guy in the office narrating it
and so at the end
It shows that it's you know him and he has his hair all dyed white and he's just you know
Kind of mouthing what the black guy's narration is and he's like, oh, this is why I know so much about this character
Because I am him and so i'm just picturing movie bob sitting there with morgan freeman's voice
And then it turns around and it's movie bob just mouthing while morgan's remus voice is coming out of his body
You have to watch the episode to understand this reference. I I do want to watch the office. I only hear good things about it
It's very good. You should watch it before it gets taken off netflix
Wait, is your netflix the same? Do you even have that one? Oh, yeah, I guess netflix changes based on region, right?
So maybe uh, yes, I found out that pirate bay pirate bay
Pirate bay subverts your expectations all day. Pirate bay is great. I would never suggest anyone partake in those disgusting
um
Dishonorable thievery that is the pirate would never tell people to never
Sharing is carrying rags would never I would I disavow
Sharing is carrying pirate. I gotta cover us legally
Yeah, I mean by that logic if you borrow a dvd from your friend
Like or if they give it to you because they got another copy that's stealing the movie you wouldn't download the same shit
You wouldn't download a baby, would you?
Yeah
I do all the time on sims mauler
Oh
I load babies down into the garbage disposal
It occasionally sounds like it's saying something
But then isn't to fully get at what i'm saying requires describing basically the plot of them
You know, it would be really useful for bob if instead of just saying it doesn't say anything. It doesn't say anything
He's like here's what people say. Here's why the movie doesn't have anything to do with that
Or the movie isn't giving this message. He hasn't really explained any of his points yet
He's just made declarations without giving any context to it
Well, this is kind of what we get at when we're like, yeah
These these videos are under fucking 20 minutes sure and the weather dreaded long
And so you don't want to do anything longer than that, but you don't fucking say anything yet. We're still waiting like what was
Oh, yeah, uh me and rags watched um high tops video on endgame
I actually agree with the majority of his points in it. Holy shit. He can take a while to get to saying stuff
Yeah, he's editing shit too. But I mean, well, do you mean script editing or video editing?
No, no, you know the noises and the audio and the pacing see i'll give you that
That sound as annoying as hell
But uh, I think his video editing I want to I want to say his video editing is pretty good compared to what you usually get
Which is like on a technical level sure, but it's like the decision making of how to edit the video
is awful
Just high top stop using those warm sounds please I beg you
Anyway back to bobbit
Saying something but then isn't to fully get at what i'm saying requires describing
Basically the plot of the film and its major events. So as quickly as possible bullshit. Ow, jesus christ, dude
This is a plot of joker. You were lower the sound of the ping
The sound of the ping you were warned but the the beginning of this video this is dangerous video territory
You were warned, okay
You were warned
This version of the joker starts out as a guy named arthur fleck who is poor and miserable because he suffers from a neurological condition
Of initially unknown origin that causes him to suffer offensive uncontrolled laughing in inappropriate situations
He lives alone in an economically stagnant 1980s
He doesn't live alone
What but he's got it already fucked it up. He lives is he about to say he lives alone with his mother
Is that what he's about to say?
Because he's got a picture of like the mum, you know from cmor's mum which is comparable so he knows
Condition of initially unknown origin that causes him to suffer offensive uncontrolled laughing in inappropriate situations
He lives alone in an economically stagnant 1980s gotham city with his ailing mother works part-times. Yeah, there it is
How do you he lives alone with his mother? How do you say that he actually says
Is that like he's grammatically correct to say that two people can live alone. I don't think so
Mothers aren't people. Oh shit. Sorry
I can't believe it. Wow, you just devaluing motherhood. That's disgusting
You're not the feminist. That's not what a feminist looks like bob
Yeah
Or maybe he's just saying women in general don't count as people and so therefore any man that lives with a woman lives alone
Now i'll meet him halfway and we'll say that they count as three fifths of a person three fifths
Can we yeah, we agreed. Yeah, anyone but still that would mean
Quite yeah, I think it's a good compromise and just to clarify how many people does bob count as is it 17 or
He counts it
He counts as six fifths of a person six
Yes, he's definitely six
That's my snack holder
Your hand bob no
How dare you refer to it that way
It's not my right hand is not called hand. It's called marice
Oh
See that's cultured
That is cultured
Oh, he lives alone with his mother
This is mr eugenics, thank you so much
Oh, yeah, a lot of people keep repeating that. I don't know if this is just known
Is it that he either used to or is in his mother's basement like unironically? Is that his like?
thing really
like people repeat a lot and I don't know if it's true because
Well, I hope it's true. I hope it's true. I hope it's true
Bob would consider that
virtuous
And noble and you can't understand he just he's too busy making this this incredibly
Intellectually stimulating deep content. He can't hold down a normal crappy job like the rest of his mortals can
He has to do important things like make movie critiques. I don't know that he gets enough
Of a view count to be able to live in like and well if he's with a mother's basement, it's not gonna be that expensive
What about is does he have a patreon or something?
I think somebody says he does and it's really sad to look at. Oh, oh, let's do it then
movie
My mom lives with me
Women are awesome. I would go absolutely insane if I had to live with my mother still
Well, it actually makes a bit of sense
Like he really wants to tell people that he lives alone. So he just pretends that his mom isn't a person. Oh, wow, dude
He projected that onto his video
Yes, that's a I didn't expect that 3600 from patreon a month. All right, bob
That should be oh when you said when you said sad, I thought it was gonna be something like yeah, it's the other kind of sad
Oh, that's not that's not sad. That's really disappointing
People said patreon
And I was like, oh, okay. His patreon said meaning it probably like one dollar a month type of thing, but
3600 a month
What I mean, sometimes people need to be told the joker doesn't mean anything
Are you telling me that people willingly give bob?
1600 more actually no more like
$2,000 more a month than I make working 40 hours a week dude. Have you a lot of stupid people have wallets?
Have you put out a video saying jokers meaningless? No
I guess not. Yeah get falling like movie movie fit
How could you say that chris
anyway
Movie bob thinks that joker lives alone with his mom. All right, good. Good stuff
lives alone in an economically stagnant
1980s gotham city with his ailing mother works part-time as a clown and dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian and performing on the locally recorded
Marie franklin late night talk show during a particularly bad series of events arthur shoots and kills three mean drunken investment bankers from wayne
enterprises corporation who are bullying him on the subway which seems to trigger the beginning of a psychotic break and gives him the confidence to
Pursue a romantic relationship with his pretty psychotic break
if anything
This sort of coincides with a lot of other things happening. One of those things being of the lack of availability of his medication
Yeah, there's a couple things that happen at once
Yeah, it's not a thing right? There's a lot of stuff going on at once
It's mother's situation
It's his work situation
People just don't understand that it's it's more than one thing
It's like a little thing and a little thing and a little thing and they all add up to you know
This one big thing that makes you explode, you know, like a normal person
You know, nobody just loses it on one thing. Well, maybe if that one thing is like a huge thing to happen
But it's just he's having a bad day. One thing happens on this day
Another thing happens on this day and it's like things add up. How do you not understand that?
That's a normal thing that happens in real life, you know
Yeah, um wolf you probably remember this better than I do what happens first
Him imagining that she comes to his apartment or him killing the people on the subway
Say it one more time. Um, I think she comes to his apartment first, right?
But what I'm trying to figure out is girlfriend. Did he imagine the relationship with no, no, no, no
It had to be first because it had to be first
because um
He goes he follows her to work
And then it's shortly after that that she comes to his apartment
And it's immediately after killing the guys on the subway that he uh pretends that he walked into her apartment and started kissing
And makes it happen therefore his psychotic break if you're going to call it that for imagining who happened actually before the subway not
after the subway
All right, just clarifying there with balbert he seems to have a different opinion, you know, it's not that it's provably wrong
It's a different opinion which seems to trigger the beginning of a psychotic break and gives him the confidence to pursue a romantic
Relationship with his pretty neighbor because arthur was wearing his clown makeup at the time
It also creates an urban legend of an anti-greed killer clown vigilante hunting down gotham's one percent
Which inspires billionaire thomas wayne to run for mayor on a law and order platform and in turn inspires an underclass revolution
Clown mask protest movement arthur subsequently learns that he's
He's running for mayor before that. I was actually about to ask was he announced for mayor before the subway killings?
Yeah
They ask him in an interview about like the clown
right the clown thing happened these we start wearing the clown masks and everything because
He calls him a bunch of clowns
Yeah, which yeah
Because the night that he gets the gun and he accidentally shoots the wall him and his mom were watching
thomas wayne on tv. I remember she's saying oh, you know, he's such a nice man
He's going to help us and he's like no he's not like why do you care so much? Yeah, I think that's right
Damn, he's not even getting this
just to clarify
People give us shit for doing too much like oh, they just recant the plot. It's like at least we can
I didn't realize it was such a hard ability, but you know getting there
This mother used to work for thomas wayne had an affair with him and that arthur is actually wayne's illegitimate son
But when he confronts okay, dude
Oh
Jeez if I had been doing this for this long, oh my god, don't you like improve over time most people improve over time
Well, this is the thing. I'm not going to say he's like god. Where's just he's stayed exactly the same
This video could have been made in 2006
I wouldn't be proud of it personally. That's insulting the videos made in 2000
Yeah, i'm sorry video queries of 2006. I didn't mean that that's insulting to the guy who made the first youtube video
Where he was like, hey guys at the zoo. Yeah
Bye
And just he I I don't understand his train of thought he thinks that this entire thing is just about this or is I mean
Well, I guess joker didn't even care about thomas wayne until he finds out that information
But he's he's just doing other stuff in life and then this just happens kind of on accident
You know, he's dealing with work getting fired having the relationship, you know
Trying to be a comedian and then because his mom it's just like that little annoying thing that's happening in the background with his mom
Oh check the mail check the mail did he write did he write and then he reads the letter
He's like, oh shit. Is this true? Then he starts pursuing it because he has nothing left
So
Also, is the affair?
100 percent. I thought that
I thought that the idea was that uh, you could only infer that it might have happened the affair
Yeah, I think after the he has the whole trip to the trip to the uh, the loony bin there
They have all records of all patients and everything like that. So
I think they kind of
Really stress that she's not telling the truth
That's the impression I got
Well, she's not lying intentionally right like
Maliciously rather. She's not repenting the truth
Oh
Apparently sog on his in chat. I can't see him but people want me to know that. All right
Hello, you must be in six-week heavy movie vlog
I'm, sorry. He's a disaster. Anyway
Wayne and the actual records about this it turns out that arthur's mother was severely mentally ill hallucinated her relationship adopted
He did the other thing upside down
I know it
Did arthur to make her fantasy feel more real and then neglected him being violently abused by her real partners causing the injuries
That led to his neurological damage
Oh my god
He stop using these sound effects like you're never left 2010 jesus christ
This is it's trying to tell a story but giving absolutely no context
It's like come on
He even left out the part where he goes to the house and you know messes with bruce and then you know meets alfred
And then goes and confronts thomas way and then you know finds out all the information about his mom and it's you know
All these stepping stones onto his descent into madness
It's like how are you just leaving out all of this fucking information or do you not are you that dense?
Do you not understand this movie?
Like I feel like this is one of those things
Have you ever watched a movie with a kid and like every two seconds like why why they do that?
What's that? What's that and they ask you like 10 million questions. I feel like that's what it would be like
Watching a movie with him. It's like you have to explain every five seconds. What's going on because he just doesn't understand it
I also find it pretty uh, I don't I don't even know what feeling describes it exactly
But he's like this person was beaten as the child to the point where they have mental damage as an adult
And then he puts wah wah after it and it's like oh
Okay, like yeah
Mocking that up before
Damage that's kind of
Apparently he doesn't think that child abuse is a thing to talk about he thinks it's funny. All right, that's what he's going for
He's like, oh
Children get abused. Oh, well around they're white. It doesn't matter
He also realizes that he himself has been similarly hallucinating the romance with his neighbor and learns that marie franklin has used a video clip of
Him bombing at an open mic comedy night as the subject of the show out of order again
Well
He doesn't realize or we don't know if he knew it the entire time or not
But that's after that is so fucking far after he sees his little thing on the tv
His mom has a fucking stroke because he goes off on her then she's in the hospital
Then he's watching the tv then he sees the thing and then he gets the call from the people but that
Oh my god
It's it's hard to recall the movie, okay
Movie bob's trying. I have seen this movie once the night. It came out, which was what two months ago now
And it would uh, oh, oh this is making me mad
It's okay. It's okay. He'll make you even more mad soon. Probably my head hurts
I'm gonna go get it cetera and I will be right back. He has that power. Yeah
They've made memes about how many people he's killed
I believe he killed uh
Jay Longbun before right
You were on you left while we were covering him at some point. I think it was ephab 50
Mm-hmm. He killed you. How do you feel you got resurrected?
He killed me wait what
Whatever if ever anyone leaves while we're covering a movie ball video, it means he killed you
Oh, okay. Yeah
He killed me before we even started the video yep
Yes, that star wars girl, like I got a headache and I had to let um, i'm bouncing
That that that was the thing is like
The last time that I that are the only other time that I watched a movie bob video
It gave me a headache so bad that I had to leave the show
naturally
I mean, uh ada just said she's getting something for headaches
So, you know, it's it's only a matter of time just the idea is to don't dose yourself too high of a movie ball
At a time you just gotta take it easy
Man the identity of the jokes create jowls create a super sonic sonic wave. Yeah
I just don't understand because I mean all of us make videos, right?
So you there's always those people that comments like you said this wrong on this part of your video at this second
And it's like holy fucking shit. I pronounced a name wrong. Oh my god
I mean body man of evil, but it's like if people just do that, you know our videos
It's like what do people do when they watch movie bob?
It's like bro, you you're not even getting the you know chain of events. Correct
Like won't people just destroy him in the comments of this? No because it only amounts to messages
Does he is he one of those people that censors his comments
I'm gonna assume not have you ever tried reading comments? I'm gonna where where's the link to this actual video?
I want to go read the comments and see if anyone called him out on how stupid this shit is. Well is uh bottom right is uh
In the little thing you can see bottom right of what uh, watch together
It'll have the video and you can click that and it'll take you to the actual one
But um
Yeah, he's he's been uh, he's been called out before
um, I think he like I said
people don't really like him on the escapist because
He's terrible
so like
He's so they got their noble escape is they got their double escapist called ted that is just like uh
Oh no, what oh no, what what is it?
Is he gonna paste something in a moment? It's gonna give us context. I'm excited
He's wearing a candy corn kkk hat
Oh
Oh, he's he's gonna be stretching them if he puts all that weight on them be careful bob you only get one set
Candy corn helmet
Shakes and doughnuts and cubes
Um, anyway
Bringing to appear as a guest on the franklin show with the aim of committing an on-air suicide
But he is instead riled up by the surprisingly positive reaction of the audience and an outside mob of clown master
protesters to his off-the-cuff rant against the madness of society that he murders murray instead
Wait, wait, wait, he he skipped he skipped the movie. He skipped like 45 minutes of the fucking movie
It's fine. He literally is going fine. He's doing it because this movie means nothing
He missed the whole entire thing about how the
he's running away from the cops because the cops came to the hospital and talk to him about his mom because they're
They think that he you know is the guy that shot the people they skip the entire part about
Him and you know his old co-workers coming the sleazy guy that betrayed him and then the little midget guy
And it shows that he actually you know, even though he's going to kill people
He still has morals because he's like, oh you were the only one in this entire, you know movie that was nice to me
You know, I had to make up other people that were nice to me and just
How how did he miss this?
how did he go from this and leave out all the information between, you know this event to this next event and
The thought about killing himself and then leaving out all the little information that's in his journal
he left out the whole entire thing about not being on his meds anymore and the psychiatrist and
How because that's how you plot summarize you ignore the plot
I want to have somebody listen to a movie bob video and then I want to go. All right, so
Tell me about it
What happened?
What what happened? What what what was movie bob's main point here? What what was I mean?
All i've got to worry so far is columbine. That's it. I'm like, oh, yeah that happened
Tell me what you learned from watching that movie bob video
That he cherry picks he leaves out so much information
This is this is the example of you know
When you were in like english class and you had to read the book and then you had to have a discussion with the rest
Of the class and you know write the synopsis and that was it
Yeah, that's that's what this is he read some of the points he read a really bad
You know little sparknotes version of somebody that also read a sparknotes version and he's getting like fourth hand information
And that's why he doesn't understand this movie. I don't think he's seen it
I mean, it's not even because we're almost to the part where he's going to start making statements about the film
Like this is where it's going to get really bad. Probably
Oh boy
Police cruiser taking him to jail is destroyed and arthur himself is rescued and revived by the army of clowns now destroying the city
The joker strikes a triumphant pose as not far away
One of his self-declared minions stalks the wane family into an alley and shoots thomas and martha dead
So that bruce can begin his journey toward becoming robert patinson like two years from now
The robert patinson movie is not even connected to the joker movie. It's okay. We can just assume that was a joke. We'll just assume
It was a joke. It's fun. This guy doesn't seem smart enough to understand that type of humor. Well
How else can we deal with this i'm sorry
He's trying to he's trying to explain ending of this movie in like a mocking fashion
Like this is actually how they end it i'm like no, but tell me what the problems are
But that's not how it ends
Well, I did say well, he's trying
He was going to talk about the movie halfway through like I was wrong about that, but he hasn't actually said anything yet
They did it
Oh my goodness
We even have the d
The d for petus
Oh my god, I like that his lips hagged out as he floats along
Incredible weight and his inability to physically lift them
Yes, yeah
Remember when he goes to the people in the spaceship and like their bones are all shrunk because they're all like just floating
They're all super fat. I feel like
Movie bob is from that generation of humans
Movie bob is in war confirmed i'm i'm doing saying that he's an advanced human
No, no, they're not advanced the ship does everything for them. Remember the the pilot has to you know
Go above the computer to figure it out
You're just jealous. This is peak humanity
Literally, the only thing I remember from wally is at the end of the movie one of the fat people was like let's plant pizza plants
Well, which is not a bad idea. Yeah, if I could have a pizza tree, I would plant one
I would too if that existed, you know, I think there's a cheat for that on sims. There you go
Let's be honest. Well if you would plant this shit out of that
Yeah, you'd plant that pizza tree. Well, that's why I remember
Anyway, let's crop is coming in good this year. Let's do it bob. We're gonna have pizzas all winter
Thanks for taking me to the movies in this dangerous neighborhood dad
Stop you can't go. This is teen titans, right? Oh, oh my god
Oh teen titans go right how dare you use the
The only thing that's worse than this is so the titans show
Which one
The new one where um
Like fat and black
Oh, yeah
Just like at least make her fucking orange
I don't care if it's a black actress, but just make her orange. You can go find, you know, black cosplay
Girls that do like the most legit starfire cosplay and they just did that. It's like come on
orange titan bad
Oh as you might have now surmised there are a lot of different angles from which to point out that this movie is
extremely dumb
Even with what he described what was dub about it
I I just want to have a conversation. I don't I want to I I just want to ask him
How he's getting from point a to point b because it just it's not
It's just dumb. It just it just
Uh, uh my head
You don't understand because you're dumb
Different angles from which to point out that this movie is
Extremely dumb in a way that makes the self-seriousness which it takes itself particularly bad approach the wrong note
loudest key all the way
I think I might break
It's happening again. My head is starting to hurt
Okay, everything that he just said about joker. I'm gonna roll that on reverse to his video. Okay, dude, your video is dumb
Uh, there's no substance to anything that you just said because you provide absolutely no context
All of the examples that you use are wrong and you don't get them right. It just
Ah my head my head it hurts
We're halfway through the video. Yeah, we're making like no
absolutely
I just want to say that I like how movie bob's visual style of putting shit all over the screen is so reminiscent of bret keene
He's going for the pop art. Um aesthetic but
I don't know why
Brett's like child
Imagine so I don't know which one is um, which one came first in like the ancient lore books
I don't I don't know how to decide. Yeah, it's hard to tell how old brett is because he looks like he's 60
But I guess he's only like 40
it's true
There are a lot of different angles from which to point out that this movie is
Extremely dumb in a way that makes the self-seriousness which it takes itself particularly bad approach
I'm i'm sure the rigor that he would explain to us the plot
Inconsistencies of the joker would be the exact same rigor that he would use to explain
How the last jade makes I don't even think he would go with plotting
He's just going to focus entirely on the fact there's no meaning in the film
I guess there's entirely subjective. Anyway, like what does everything mean to you?
He's already taken away from bull
I would love to hear him like actually start to say things like explain things in an object. This is why
Objectivity is very important. We need make claims like show evidence for something that you think
uh explain to us stuff that's happening and
Things tell tell us things right? Tell us why they're good. Why they're bad
Give a substance to pick a part
He has just made statements. He hasn't defended any of his points. He's like, oh well this this and this happen
The joker is a dumb movie. It's like what?
It's a meanie. It's dumb movie. Nothing happens. There's no meaning in it. It's empty. I want to um,
Someone made a meme
It's got black panther is alt right because it's anti-immigration. Isolation
Isolationist pro-wool strict trade restrictions
Anti-diversity and ethno-nationalist and bob has retweeted the picture and said hey probably a good idea for you to watch the movie first
It's like oh
Funny coming from you buddy. I don't know
Whoa
An anon meme but very nice note
Here's a thing that's in the works
Apparently
One moment making a pop out rags
Yay, that's amazing. You got a little tongue. That's incredible
So you can you can put them out
Yes, it's very fluffy
It's like a like a little cloud around back there
Oh, that's really cool
How someone's making a little so I guess you could you could print it out on
Paper and you could fold it up and you could put you put me on your desk
So I can always stare at you and look at you and advise you when you make a bad argument
Yeah, absolutely
Yes. Oh, oh, oh, right. I've had like your catch phrases like every your secrets
Oh when you said hi rags and it said hello, that'd be cute. Oh my god, uh, you press a button
Well in efap is you're gonna want to keep an eye on efap.me to see what every day is gonna bring
If this is this is day one
Is this
Like did they actually make one and that's a picture or is it? I don't know. I don't know how deep this goes
I don't know what what the dealio is here. It's a really cool project idea
That's incredible. I wonder if they'll have a long man or a wolf or pizza. Oh, maybe
That is so cute that is adorable
It's hard to believe that we have to go from this back to movie bob yeah, sorry about that guys
Obviously, uh don't need to do this to you worlds. I don't mean to torment you folks
Dumb in a way that makes the self seriousness which it takes itself particularly bad approach the wrong notes played in the loudest key
All the way through you could literally start your what the hell went wrong with no. No, just pick one just please just pick one
All of the things are wrong which one
Tell us why
Please bob this is a problem. Tell us why something not just that it is
Joker doctoral analysis in a hundred different ways and they'd all lead to the same breakdown
But since I don't have all day i'll use the one that jumps. I think we had a are we on 540?
I'm on 542
Yeah, all right. Let me
Roll it back my thing here. So
We're not even halfway through
It's okay. It's okay
We can do this if we just stick together teamwork teamwork makes the dream work halfway through we're halfway through
We aren't oh, yeah, i'm looking at a wrong number
I saw the 42 and thought it was a 42 minute video. Oh god. No god
Different ways and they'd all lead to the same breakdown, but since I don't have all day i'll use
The one that comes out of me when it's clear forty two forty three
I think you're mostly in sync. You should be right. Okay. All right. Why does this movie take place in the 1980s?
Rags would you like to field that question?
Why does this take place in the 1980s? Well, there are some budget cuts in the 1980s that were in that
Were like mental health stuff
So that was probably a good parallel there
Yeah, uh, it's to do with reagan, right?
Yeah, some some cuts that were made to like mental health and stuff like that
So that's probably one reason why isn't it?
I happen to think probably another reason is the the lower security elements the yes the ease of the crimes being committed
I think cell phones
The talk show stuff a lot of this could take place in modern time. Sure, but yeah, and I think it lends itself to
isolationiness a lot easier with with the lack of any kind of
Easy contact being set that far away. But like
Then we have the ultimate question once we give all of those reasons we're like
Why do you why does it matter? Like what's the problem?
Batman outfit looking good. Oh, yeah
Yeah, this sort of reminds me that gripe. I think i've probably said this
Reminds me this gripe nostalgia critic had about district nine
Like well, why are the aliens aliens? Why couldn't you just make a movie about people?
Because I wanted to that's why shut the fuck up because it's a fucking movie about aliens
Why are there aliens in this alien movie it's like well, fuck I don't know
Why are you just making a movie about black people? Why didn't you send joker in the future?
Hmm
Yeah, why wasn't it? Why wasn't it? Why wasn't it set in the stone age idiot? Yeah
I don't know
Take place during the renaissance
This is where I mean i'm just like what's your what's your argument here?
And fix the cropping on your fucking video
And I don't just mean minor annoying stuff like there's no way arthur fleck is on seven psychiatric medication
And it's in the mid 80s and not basically comatose all the time
Okay, okay
Do you know the boogie tune is on like fucking 10 medications
Um the one i'm getting out there is the just because it's a large amount doesn't mean it's impossible
My dad is on several medications. Like this is not something that is impossible
uh
I don't know why you would highlight the like
He should be coming to the point
He's finally gotten to the point in his video where he's starting to sort of say things that are sort of a why
But the first one is how come it takes place in the 80s and then he just has a batman clip play
Like no, no, no, no, no tell it explain use words use your thoughts
Explain to us why it's bad that it takes place in the 1980s
Tell us why that's bad. We we pass that now too bad. I know
And now he's going on to now he's gone on to are you telling me that he was on like seven medications in the 80s he's like
Yeah, we we had pills and stuff in the 80s. Yeah
This was a thing that you could do
What was the problem here?
As it always goes for boogie. I'm, sorry
I don't know anybody else who's like a famous youtuber who has several medications as an easy proof like you can check this
He's got a video about it. I'm just saying this is a thing that happens and I don't know why but
What a non-point and like let's say for example that it was a rule
From doctors everywhere if you have any more than four medications you die and he has seven in this movie
I'd be like, oh, I guess in this universe you don't die when you have four
That's just such a weird. I don't know
Yeah, but it's like what if can you tell us why the story doesn't make sense or I know it's just
It's like oh no seven. He has
seven
um
Seven medications and he's not even in a coma. He's like
Okay
Oh, I remember there was this one analogy that
um
Like when I was in college and we were talking about, you know art criticism
One of the things that my professor said that stuck with me was
When somebody's, you know complaining about the curtains on the titanic
They don't really have a valid argument because it's the curtains on the fucking titanic, you know
It has nothing to do with what's gonna
It with what's going to affect the end result
So that's what I think of when people say little things like that. It's like
Okay, he's on seven medications
You can argue that that did or did not exist at that time
If you want to do your research, you could probably find that out
But at the end of the day I the medication it doesn't matter the amount because he could just be taking one pill and it's like
Okay, he's taking one form of medication
The amount doesn't matter the fact is when it comes into play is when he's talking to his two friends
Which are co-workers that the dude left out
Was that he's off of his medication and he feels great and you know, the friends are alarmed by that
That's the only time that really comes in play
If he's saying that it's a problem. He needs to explain why or
Does he have a reference? Does he have a study? I mean all we can draw is that
He's telling us that he should be comatose with his bed. He pills is like, okay
I don't think that's true. At the same time. He doesn't even know what those pills are
Some of those pills could just be placebo pills that you know, he drinks are working on him, you know
And why them could be aspirin, you know, he's taking aspirin maybe he's taking something because again
He was harmed as a child. He's got, you know, some kind of brain damage. He's probably taking something, you know
For his brain. Maybe I don't know for his thyroid. I don't know any little things
And like you said like even if even if he was right about like in all these different ways stuffs like is that it?
He taking too many pills for you
Okay
occasions in the mid 80s and not basically comatose all the time because
Prescription strength was a whole different context back then and they're imposing a 2019 opioid second medication context on an 80s setting or how a
No, no, no, no, no, no
There's absolutely no evidence for any of that that he just said
Yeah, no evidence even if he said prescription strength was higher back then
prescription strength depending on the pill is like
How can you make this claim definitively?
Like how could how could you possibly make the claim? Let's let's just say one of the pills he takes is
I don't know, uh 20 milligrams and nowadays
They only give you tens because it's too powerful or whatever
It's like you could still just take 20 with the two tens put together
Is like the idea that all prescriptions amounts have gone down since the 80s thus he should have been in a coma
what
We got some we got some boat curtains going on up in here
I am not following you there bob feels like like this is what I would call like
Grasping at straws to hate the movie based on if based on a thing that if true is absolutely a nitpick
He's supposed to be the one that hates us for that
He's just
This is his problem
This is what he finds is you know
The big plot hole in the movie is that he the amount of pills he's taking which they explain
He had a lot of trauma happen to him as a child
So he's going to have problems growing up and he's going to have to take supplements for that
It's like yeah
Yeah, not not a pharmacist or he's literally nitpicking
Not a pharmacist or doctor, but i'm almost certain that he cannot be right with his claim
And i'm just a layman like it doesn't sound like this could be right
Plot point the idea that they may have had stronger prescriptions back in the day. I'm not disputing that it's the idea that uh
They were so strong that you die if you had seven pills
Non-descript pills
Okay, like you know, not all pills like you have anything to do with each other right like not all pills
Do stuff that would conflict
You buy a lot of stuff going on in your body a lot of pills that do all kinds of
different sorts of things
And also doctors when they see what pills they're prescribing you they make sure that they prescribe medications that aren't going to you
Know interfere and interact with each other in a negative way on your body
There's this whole episode. Did you guys ever watch house?
Yes. Yeah. Okay. Remember the episode where the blonde girl dies
No, and you don't one there's a
Some of the bus the bitch the bitch. Yeah the yeah
Jane Doe one and he's he's like, oh I need to find this girl
Because something and he's trying to remember then he remembers and it's because he saw her taking this medication
But because she was in the bus accident and they didn't know that she was on that medication
They give her this other medication that reacts bad with medications. He was taking so it kills her
Okay, so that would never happen when you're prescribing medication, you know
Sorry, i'm just making a note that if you take seven pills you die
Seven pills die
I'll need it
I'll go right into a gedel video. I think
Turns on what's essentially a video clip going viral, which didn't just happen back then i'm talking about the why of these
Oh, um, pretty sure there are people who have argued against this. This is a common
Argument against the film that there was no like home video bullshit on tv. That wasn't a thing
And there are people who've argued that not only was there stuff like that, but um
Audiences would totally be on board with doing something like that
That's nothing that we developed recently
Like a reaction culture the idea that you're watching a show in the 80s and they're like
We're going to play you a clip from a struggling comedian who embarrassed himself
Do you really think the people at home would be like this is horrible can't have this. Oh
disgusted
Um
Don't people remember like 20s america's funniest home videos
Well, the thing is this is set in
This is set in the 80s. Is it this film?
Yeah, I thought I thought america's funniest home videos came out in the 80s
Well, the thing is I think it came out in the late 80s or something
And it's just like isn't that close enough to lend credence to this?
Yeah, I mean
It's like people didn't have fucking cameras in the 80s at all
They weren't taking home videos
I mean, didn't he say on tv that one of his scouts was out there and filmed it?
And then that's how he got the video
I'd have to rewatch it out
Well, I've got a lot of comedy clubs would record there
Is anyway
Yeah, I could picture that
I mean, let's see. We've got the tv, uh tv programs of 1981
Dallas mash the jeffersons dynasty threes company facts of life happy days 60 minutes
Uh, the love boat magnum p.i. Laverne and shirley. I mean there there's plenty of there's plenty of stuff that's going on
Um, let's see if we want to do like this to reality sort of shows
Not to mention all of the game shows that took place
Uh candid camera
Uh queen for a day wait candid camo was in 1981
Uh, it was from candid camera started in 48
And what's the premise of that show?
Candid camera, I think it's where there's just like a camera setup and it catches people almost like punks
You don't know they're being filmed. Yeah, they put them in weird scenarios. The fact that that exists surely this this that functions as reasoning
I mean it's it's ridiculous to say that this couldn't happen. It clearly could
Because the other argument people make is that like nobody would do this to a man who's clearly mentally ill. It's like, um
I don't think anyone in gotham would have a shitty comedian
And yeah, not that's the other fucking problem. If you watch the footage it would be the way the um
Uh murray is cut it or at least his team has cut it
It's just the delivering the joke and to be honest with you. I don't even think it's that bad a joke
It's murray burns him straight after
like um
I and I think you know, he doesn't involve all the context of the him laughing when he gets on stage, but even if he did
Um, you'd be like, oh god, this guy's so awkward. He's laughing in his own joke before he delivers it
That's pretty much the natural assumption instead of being like this man is clearly mentally ill help him
Do not laugh at him
Like I don't I feel like that's a bit of projection because like a 1980s audience would just be like look at this
Failing comedian lol
I don't think they take it much further than that
Um, well, I mean he's also leaving out the context of you know
The way that he views murray as a father figure and then the impact it has on when murray is making fun of him on tv
Uh, that's a pretty big thing that happens as to why you know, he does the thing that he does at the end
I guess he's he's well, he's about to argue by the way that these things are problems, but they don't matter
At least that's what I thought I heard him say. So I'm just gonna let him carry on back then
I'm talking about the why of these issues is the setting a movie out of time
Especially in the recent past is a big undertaking. It's probably where most of this movie's 55 million dollar budget went
Okay
Remember the dark night
This movie's like earning money this is such a non sequitur it doesn't even matter why are you talking about this?
You get it because he said the most of the money probably went on
Making the setting and then you have a joker from dark night saying it's not about the money. It's about sending a message which doesn't
Yeah
You haven't told us why the message is bad
You're the one saying that it's supposed to send a message that you can't identify you've asked us
But you haven't looked into it. I'm giving him loads of benefit the doubt here
But maybe he's trying to say that it's the reverse for this film. It's not about the message. It's about spending money
And even if that's the case, well, that'll be wrong
There's no way this movie doesn't have a message it's just a stupid fucking premise from beginning with this video
Can a movie not have an aesthetic for its own sake does the star
We need to have a reason to have things take place where they take place
Well, like this movie that takes place in albacurte
It has to take place those flaws he highlighted he thinks that sent in the 80s meant those things were flaws
while if they were set now they wouldn't have been like the um
The candid camera sort of thing plus the the medication he made arguments that imply that if this was set today
Those things would make sense, but he's wrong
He's looking to try and prove that the setting was like done for
Whatever reason that gets in the film's way, but it's just the opposite
But hey, at least we're actually getting arguments though. Like I gotta I appreciate both for making an argument even if it's terrible
Okay, but I mean, okay aside from the some of the costumes the way that it's filmed
You know the the filter that they put on after you know post
But
Well the city I mean the city didn't look too different and that's one of the great things about cities is you could just film it
You know, I could go to san francisco go down a random street in san francisco put on a costume
You know or dress in 80s clothing film it put a little filter over it to make it look like it's a camera
That's from the 80s and there you go. It's a movie from the 80s
That's something that's great about cities is in a way
As long as you don't go downtown where it's all ultra modern in the new part of the cities
If you film in certain areas, you could do period pieces like this
so I don't see what his big argument is and that's what it looked like there wasn't anything iconic about the
You know the setting that where they filmed aside from that one building where he goes in thomas wayne the opera house
Um, but I mean even then that's the stays and now the stay has been made iconic. Thanks to this film as far as I can tell
anyway
Like people are going to the stays now just to take pictures
It's not like they went and did all this, you know
Higher work with our all of our budget into you know vfx they just went to different parts of new york and filmed
And they didn't you know
I'm assuming they didn't remodel any of the buildings to make it look like it was from the 80s
as I understand it they used like a little bit of cgi in the buildings to like
Yeah, you know make it look like it was in the 80s
Okay, and that's actually pretty easy to do
And for a film that didn't spend that much money relatively
This is very strange that he's
like given this burning money kind of
Imagery year, you know
It's like man. They they made a lot of money
They made a crap ton of money for how little made a lot more money than godzilla did
I mean it outperformed the dark night made buddy
Like that's pretty that's a big deal
Not to mention he outperformed the dark night with the role of the joker which most people were like
You're not gonna be able to top he's ledger
Not making a claim that he did making the claim that it's a pretty tough role to come into
But maybe maybe jarred lato made it made it easier for him. I don't know
No, I got no beef with jarred it's all good
You're, okay, buddy. I still haven't seen that movie
don't don't
Don't know that's what I was told
Black text on a black background. That's how incompetent that film is
Ah
Money
It's about sending a message
You have to change the backgrounds use different lighting dress sets down to tiny details get old cars old clothes old tv and video
Yeah, that looks great reference photos. You jittery alter the skyline if it's a real location all kinds of stuff
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done. Does he not understand that they have to
Every single movie and the way that it's not where they're spinning
What was it for like the batman suit like 50 grand bill making a batman suit for what was his name?
The last batman dude
Uh an athlete. Oh, yeah, okay you you get a what you spend like a couple hundred bucks making a little
You know red suit for the joker
And also everything that he just complained about about the setting and you know the cars
You can find all of that in new york. Guess what they did
I guess in movie bob's mind unless there's a specific reason it cannot take place in modern time of filming
If you're a filmmaker who enjoys the 80s just as a fucking time and place
Uh go away unless you have a reason to put it there
Yeah, it movies need to be shot at the contemporary time that they're being made
Unless there's specifically is a reason it cannot be shot at that time because your artistic vision
Or if you just like the aesthetic of that time period or the attitude of the time is something
It just can't
It's it's I just think this guy doesn't understand everything that he just complained about is
Things that aren't necessarily difficult to do especially in hollywood with where there's professional people that know how to do this
Very efficiently and you know on a budget
I want to I want to highlight two things that I've just spotted that are funny. So first
Uh a bob chipman tweet. I don't know. Well, this was made in 2017. Uh
The best day that will ever happen to humanity will be the moment when physical strength becomes meaningless and intellectual worth and creative vision
Become the only measures of a human being to be considered. That's the superior future of course
Because he's bad at both doesn't that make you think like oh you were beaten up when you were younger were you
Budget people beat you up. I'm sorry about that
This fat loser would be like I hope that in the future strong people don't exist
As someone that just moved I
Seriously appreciate people with physical strength because this shit was heavy. Yeah. Well, they're bullies
They were bullying you by moving. They were they were patriarching you
I 100 will accept the patriarchy if they want to help with
60 pound
Furniture out of a moving truck. I am 100 happy and grateful. I also want to I guess movie bob doesn't understand the kind of
Like main I know movie bob doesn't understand any this but maintaining a strong body
Takes a lot of oh, yeah willpower and consistency
Perseverance, you know, it's it's not like again. Bob had no fucking clue about any of this
But the the old the old saying uh, anima sana and core
Corporia sauna, you know a sound mind and a sound body like they're both two parts
that are you know important, you know, you want to have a healthy body because you're
You know your your brain and the way that you live and your health that all comes together and it creates one whole you
It's important
Oh and uh as as uh, some time alone highlighted. I think we kind of went over it a little bit but um
There'll be in just there'll be an industry in hollywood
That's like we make old-timey cars so you can rent us out and we'll give you access to all of these same for costumes and everything else
Um, it's not as it's not like this built from the ground up and then burned to a cinder every single film
That's made like no. No
This stuff gets carried over and saved and everything
um
I think car wasn't it. Um, I only know this thanks to uh, red lab media, but
if a star trek episode is using like a bunch of um
Stuff from like the victorian era
There's a good chance that a tv show was filming something victorian
In the area at the time and that they just were able to grab the bunch of costumes be like, yeah now we can do this
um
Also, apparently in jeremy john's review of knives out
He said another thing that ryan johnson's movies have in common is they're not as clever as he thinks they are
Ooh, that was that was such a fun thing to hear him say
Come on efab jeremy do it
Someone actually posted that in the comments of uh, I believe the knives out trailer
Or trailer on that video the knives out trailer jeremy call it efap
He like answers it like sure what
Oh, yeah, why not?
Anyway, you might carry on bobbit in all kinds of stuff. So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done
Appointment the story is making or frozen at 6 43
Oh my god
Are you frozen? That's that's that's a here. That's again a sequel. So
Well, she's getting a lot of
I just
What has uh bob ever said about the incels because there's no way bob's getting poontang
I mean dude, no bullshit is so
What
No, I was curious I was wondering I don't know he's married to a he's a married to an admiral holdo doll
Isn't there that ryan gosley movie where he like has a sex doll that he takes around and pretends
That's his actual girlfriend maybe movie bob got some inspiration
I can't believe I I can't believe I ever feel sorry for a sex doll
Imagine being film robert's sex doll
Just just just
I can just hear the the slap against the sex
Oh he calls it apparently
He's posted pictures before of his basement apartment, that's what he calls it
Oh
His basement apartment. My apartment's above ground
His basement apartment. I love the rag says I live above ground a movie. I was like you above ground
You think you're so much better
He's wearing a phantom of the opera mask
Above the ground they will learn nothing
Oh
What's in the darkness I dwell my criticized movies
Did you guys ever watch that puss in boots tv show? No, no
No, okay. Well
Huh?
That's a thing. That's a thing. That is a thing
Is it based off of the shrek one? Yes, it is
Is it like funny? Is it shrek good or is it shrek 3 quality? And no, it's
Horrendously awful, but there's
Where there's all people and there's a mole people kingdom and then the mole people
Something happened to where the cat people were digging a well and it led into the mole people land and the mole people want to take
Over the cat land, but that that's and they've talked about oh above grounders
You say I thought you're saying the mole people
They were around so i'm you know
Wow
Silency she knows what she did
I'm just picturing like how how does every day movie bob has to wake up in his basement apartment?
Have his mom make him breakfast. He's like a 45 year old man or something
I'm gonna make sure to say basement apartment in gudelb
Basement apartment and he has to go online and play this
this super intellectual
Holier than thou piece of shit character essentially and act all big and bad and tough and super smart
But he's he knows that he's doing this from a basement apartment and that he's this
Fat slob who doesn't take care of himself and he's just this pathetic human being
That must be really tough like to live with that every day, you know
No, it's really wear on a man's psyche
It's what drove him to become diabeto
Diabeto
They will respect me now
So who is diabeto's counter like, uh, magneto's got professor x so who's the exercise or
The exercise it's like this treadmill that said deal
Yeah
He's gonna give you a shot of insulin that is his, uh, archonosis
the dieter
Do you remember in x-men 3 where they have those things that uh,
They take your powers away when they get injected into you that would be insulin for him. He'd be like no
He's like my power
my diabetes
Instead it takes his fat away and he just like he shrivels
It is
Picturing the fucking creature from the the moisturize me creature from doctor who this this deflated flap of skin with a face and it's just like
no, there was a
There was an episode of aquitine hunger force where carl had like a parasite inside of him
And he got really really skinny
And that's kind of how I picture
Movie bob with all of his his powers sucked out of him with all of his lard just
squeezed out
professor exercise
and professor exercise
No, not my sickness
All kinds of stuff
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done a point that the story is making or a portion of the narrative
That can only be conveyed in the sense of that temporal context usually in a socio-political or historic. Oh, it's not playing for you
Yeah, just reload. Yeah, just try reloading it should work
Um, is it up for you
And I have to go where where did you leave off it I should automatically drag you if I do this
okay
Okay, 640 we'll go to six six thirty
Bars old clothes old tv and video clips match reference photos digitally alter the skyline if it's a real location all kinds of stuff
So there's usually a specific reason it has to be done a point that the story is making or a portion of the narrative
That can only be conveyed in the sense of that temporal context usually in a socio-political or historical reference point
But basically none of joker's socio-political reference points have any connection to the historical context
They're being juxtaposed with aside from the very very very blatantly connected one that by the way like
You'd think movie bob would know about it. The whole social programs getting cut thing
um
In the 80s i'm pretty sure actually
He might be around man, but he's not a smart man
Damn, so the top comment on his video
Why does this movie take place in the 1980s? I don't know bob
It's almost like that was the time when reagan era budget cuts gutted the nation's mental health protections leaving an entire generation of desperate ill people
Thrown onto the street because society literally did not care about them. The video clips did not go viral
Um, yeah, they did like at least in a different way
Like it's different to think that uh, think about given our current time
But before the internet there was a huge hegemony of cultural interest
Everyone watched the news everyone read the papers. Everyone watched the big game and almost everyone watched a big show of the night
Uh a la snl johnny carston, etc
So if one of those people did that for a quick laugh and they did occasionally do that then it would be seen by basically everyone
The historical setting does not impact the theme or plot of the story
Again, did you just forget that reagan and the rise of moral majority was a thing
Joker's whole thing fits neatly into the framing of large powerful government types telling poor disenfranchised and sometimes incredibly vulnerable people
That they just need to pull up their bootstraps buck up and say no to drugs
And if that didn't work and they were just bum, uh bum social parasites
Yeah, he says I know you have a lot of weird hang-ups
Uh, I know you have a lot of really weird hang-ups about class, but this is really basic obvious stuff
What's the thing? Uh
He's not gonna draw connect. This is his second joker video and he's not even gonna put out a correction for that shit
But whatever
I guess we're gonna take a minute to appreciate how wrong he is
A moment of silence through here a little bit. Um
Let's see
Someone said the least believable part of joker is that investment bankers would be taking the subway
I mean if they're drunk, yeah, yeah, who knows who knows
That happens all the time
I mean if you're heading home drunk with some friends and you're like, this is the fucking subway's going we could just go that way
Home is fast. Okay
I mean you don't want to drive. You know what I mean? Like I don't know seems a bit weird
Is he saying they should get a taxi?
Well, I mean they could just be taking the subway from one bar to another
You know, I didn't see any briefcases with them
Bob likes to pretend all of his rhetorical questions don't have answers when they just do and he just doesn't give a shit
So true
Anyway
But and neither does that juxtaposition provide any meaningful counter context the anti-rich people clown mobs are a joker-pied mash-up of the occupy wall street
And anonymous movements both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s
They don't make sense transposing to what we're I guess supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation of a 1980 city
Yeah, there weren't there were writers in the 80s. There weren't like protest movements in the 80s people
I mean like something happening here
I'm gonna go as far as saying that this has been a thing since there was societies of any kind civilizations
There was groups of people who would want to potentially rise up
And do something about it. You don't have to reference like the fact that he's picked
Uh those two and said these are not uh occurring in a time in which this film is set. They're all bad
It's like no. No, that's not how that works
I mean, it could be a compilation of different things
I mean jesus christ you wouldn't even at that point you wouldn't even need to uh
That's still fine. Uh, so like what what prevents it from being in an earlier time like oh, uh
Literally nothing like oh, so why can't it be in this time? Oh, um
I don't know. I just don't want it to be like, okay
Well, it's what's one of those you just flip around and say what's wrong with it being in this time?
Like i'm gonna go ahead. What's the problem here my heart. Take this is fictional this movie
It's not actually a documentary
So what yeah, I can't be just like i'm sorry
Red pill black pill incel loser nerd white man like joker my hero
I guess not. Oh, i'm sorry
Movements both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s
They don't make sense transposing to what we're I guess supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation of a night
Also, this is this is his interpretation of what the crowds are supposed to be
Yep, and he's saying my interpretation doesn't make the interpretation that I made up doesn't make any sense to me
A mob can't just be a mob of people. I can't represent it has to be referential to a particular riot again
Yeah
He look at this fucking mob in the movie compared to occupy wall street because they both wear masks
It's just yeah, that's what I mean. It's really surface level for
uh
You know why he did this he wants to try and say the movie's bad, but he's got really
Thin and a few arguments. Also, uh bayouin just said um
1992 king riots day of mass violence looting and murder because one man was being beaten by the police
I obviously would need to look into it, but
The uh, i'm kind of just going for the whole like riots aren't specific to a decade. Okay
I don't I don't think anybody would there were mass protests and riots and
All that stuff
That's just this is not like a super modern phenomenon
It's weird that you think that like around
2004 people started like gathering in the streets. They just said hey guys, I got an idea
Right, you know, look at that
Keep rolling rolling rolling. Oh, no
I think that it says police clap
You stole my sign
I like the that's perfect the depiction of movement in 2d
Uh, it it amuses me
It is very well done
Uh terminator two themes just playing in my head as i'm looking at this picture
He'll be the new terminator when they make it the reboot again
These are the t
terminator 64 thousands. It's a giant gelatin ball
It rolls in a field
A tree terminator
Anyway
It's both of which were phenomenons of the early 2000s. They don't make sense transposing to what we are
I guess you can't be against corruption like the sign you fucking put in your fucking photograph says
Can't be against corruption. Corruption is a a very modern thing
It's an inherently 2000s thing rag. Not a 1980 thing. No corruption before that people weren't concerned about class
Anonymous or welfare issues which were phenomenon to the early 2000s
They don't make sense transposing to what we're I guess supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation of a 1980 city environment
Because urban mass violence flashpoints in the 80s were almost always about racial tension to one degree or another
So they can't be about anything else. Oh my god, the brain the brain hurts
Did you understand that there was like a
Oh my god
Does he think oh then in the real world these protests were mostly about race
Well, then I guess you can't fucking have protests about anything else
I'm just I just want to be like monopoly. Hey bob protests
There was no gotham in the 1980s that had an arthur flack in it that became a joker. So this is all inaccurate
Fucking shit movie doesn't know what it's doing
Yeah, it's no it. Gotham's not real. Gotcha. Ha point me to the guys
I don't remember. Do you guys remember is there a video clip?
We can find this of a guy dressed in a joker outfit shooting a co like a host of a show
Is that is that a thing?
Apparently this film is all made up. That's dumb
Fucking hate my films that are made up made up. Did you guys know that lord the rings are based entirely on reality?
I hope so it's great. Yeah
Yeah, super bowl you explain bob he does look look like an orc
How dare you orcs about that ugly
Okay. Okay. Look got the goth mug may not have looked at his best but he tried
I can just fix it. She says I've read a goth mug. He's like hi
Fucked up
And hey, hey lertz was definitely not
Well after the war of the ring it was hard to get a job as a
So I started reviewing movies in my hobbit hole
My my cave and mordor and my my basement apartment
But
I don't know man. Like i'm sure it's an actual term for all i'm aware but like describing apartments that are
Basements, but it's just it sounds like the kind of thing you'd say when you don't want to say basement
You're like it's my basement apartment. You're like, okay, you probably should have just said there's certainly
there's certainly apartments that like
If it's like a three-story apartment building the lower story will be slightly underground
But I don't think anyone ever refers to it as a basement apartment
I think it really just lives in a basement
Basement man bad my above ground dwelling
What's like the nicest way you could say you live under a bridge it's like
My
Sub uh
Would be a bridge like a trans
uh
poor I
I don't even know
I just realized that this started an argument in four words that's trending the argument dispelled incorrectly. Oh
They tried it's all given up about that that's supposed to take as an otherwise similar recreation of a 1980 city environment
Because urban mass violence flashpoints in the 80s were almost always about racial tension to one degree or another and there's no context
Given in the movie can't be about anything happening. It's making Gotham situation
It doesn't matter if it's about race you fucking gelatin tub of goo
What are we in criticism like it's not about race people can't have legitimate like
grievances
I guess not if it's not about race then shut up
You chunked hard
damn
A movie for anything happening that's making Gotham situation any different speaking of which the lone
Historical illusion in the film is about that very thing joker's first killing on the subway in elevation to folk hero
Satisfied the media is a clear evocation of the 1984 bernie gets shootings where a white guy named nope
There's no messages in the film
Apparently this is a very strong message. He's probably gonna say it says nothing about it, but apparently okay, so
There was a killing on a subway that was possibly racist from this guy or is I don't know the specifics. Um
That means that they have to be
Alluding to racism in joker. It's like does it can it just not be the crime itself?
or the the act of
Everyone who watched this movie basically got the message
And he's pulling up new york post
newspapers of bernie getts and stuff like that, you know call them by
call them by
like man
Like do you not think that all this stuff can't happen like what about this is
like
Unbelievable to you
like what about do you not think that a crowd of people can have grievances for class reasons or for
welfare reasons or for
social mobility reasons or for
City management reasons all of these reasons by people like a large group of people
Might protest in the streets and those protests might become violent like the does you think that just doesn't happen?
Like this is wild this world that he lives in this day and he's been in that basement too long. Oh my goodness
They even got maccavoy in there
Did they
Handstrings of justice
Such a shitty movie, but I want to see it
I'm looking for jump rope old friend. I would bring you jump rope in the form of a twizzler
Oh
The more you hate the harder it is
He claimed tried to rob him on a new york subway and eventually surrendered to police claiming self-defense
But was later revealed to have said a bunch of really really suspicious racist stuff leading up to it
And also the kids were maybe just panhandling and the whole thing was a huge scandalous mess
But that happened after the media had already spent months writing about a heroic subway vigilante
I don't like the twist this joke is taking
Wait, so what does that say about the film?
a crime
Well, yeah
You think there's never been another crime on a subway or somebody's gotten killed aside from this one instance and this has this movie has to be
referencing this one instance
In one list. So let's bob is really upset that joker is not like trying to give a
a racial message
That's like I said before these people are really upset this film did not tell the message that they they thought it should sell
And yeah, like i'm sort of
So like the whole the yeah, let's just say he's talking to the top fellows and on one hand he says
So you're evoking this subway shoe and yeah, and he and he goes no i've never heard of that before movie bob's upset
He's like that's insensitive. You should know about this if you're gonna do this
You're like, okay. So that's one hand the other hand he didn't know about it
And he's like, so what does your film have to do with racism and he's like, well
I mean i'm gunning for the the act itself had happened
And so that it's it's a similar one to this
But i'm not i'm not gunning for the whole like race angle because that's not what joker's about
And then bob's just like well, that's wrong
It's just silence because that's not an argument
And that's where we are
You
This is these videos are painful to get to because they seem so
disjointed and they're so little to grab on to
it's like trying to
I don't know like trying to
What what glasses are crooked
He couldn't even fix the perspective on those glasses
I know it's very simple photoshop like come on, dude
Hey, where are you guys at?
I'm at 7 44. Where are you at? Yeah, what are we looking at 7 45?
I see the joker
Oh, no
No movie bob you did not blow my mind
Oh, that's bothering the shit out of me. Don't worry. I'll get it
Seemingly edging the new verb evoking this famous event cutting out its distinctly 80s race politics and substituting the visual language of 2019 class politics allows it to say
So yeah, so he's frustrated that todd phillips has
Taken elements of different events across our own history and put them into you know
A melting pot of destruction for this society in this fictional city and he's like, okay fine
You did all of that, but you said nothing with it
It's like oh
Is that right?
So like it would be okay if if it meant something right so bob just bear with me and we'll be able to explain it to you
Because apparently you're having trouble
But i'm assuming this is where he's gonna his big climax is gonna be where he explains the movie is meaningless
It's the same way that arthur's issues with cuts to his social services and medication have the look of an 80s health care system
But are presented in the manner. That's all about 2019's various prescription addiction opioid
He did it again
People only have opioid addiction in 2019 that's never
to people
People don't have medication needs people don't need prescriptions people
Maybe maybe like prescriptions or let's see
When did prescriptions start?
History of prescription drugs
um
Okay, that's like saying I don't know if you guys ever watch but on the andy griffith show there's this little old lady that's really nosy
And so she has to go to the pharmacist to get pills because she's got to take her pills
She's a little lady. She needs her pills and then there's a new pharmacist and
She says well, you don't have a prescription
So I can't give you the pills and then the whole episode is about this little lady pretending that she's dying
Because she's not getting her pills because the new
Pharmacists won't give her her pills
Even though the old pharmacist would always give her pills without a prescription
And then you find out at the end of the episode that they've just been placebo pills that the old pharmacist was just giving it to her
So she would you know, she's okay
She's got her pills kind of thing and it's like you're saying that that
Using movie bob's logic that that is supposed to be a representation of somebody's addiction in 2019
Whereas this was a tv show that was filmed what in the 50s
Come on dude such a narrow point of view and it keep it doesn't lead him anywhere
He's like, oh it's you're you're evoking something that didn't happen in this time and you're like, do you know this?
This is well, you know infant is a misquoting him there
He's just saying it happened in this other time and it's like I guess that's just the time for that thing
Even though it's a very broad issue
Does movie bob want a documentary?
apparently
I think he needs one
like he needs like this needs to be
this needs to be a documentary about real events that actually happened and maybe the only thing he can accept is
I don't I don't know the name of the city or
I don't I don't know like this isn't real. It's
It's fine to take things that actually occurred and sort of change them around and repurpose them
They make sense
It's like a whole riot thing. Yeah, sure. Let's say let's say that movie bob in in the real ladies
Like all of the violent riots were explicitly only racial related. All right, there is nothing that say that it isn't
logical
That a mob could form or that a violent protest could form for a number of other reasons
The fact that this is his problem with a movie should be if anything just a
A a beacon for how good the movie is
It takes a lot for me to call like issues with the film petty to the point of
Pointlessness, but that's what we have here. These are like non-issues
Yeah, I'm struggling to actually understand exactly what the problem is
What does he want? What do you want?
Tell me what you know what I want
I want my headache from this guy to go away you'll be cured in approximately three minutes
Who knows that'll last don't
Three three minutes is gonna be another hour. I don't know what you have
Or the viral video thing which is trying badly to plug a critique of present day social media shaming of ordinary people into an
Incompatible era where the big concern about media privacy was paparazzi and celebrity tabloid
See again, so he's echoing the point that you can't have him be humiliated on a tv show that can't happen
It doesn't work. It doesn't work in the exact same way. Therefore parallels can't be drawn
Thanks, baby bob in your galaxy brain saving the day once once more
My head hurts so bad
He's making i'm surprised how much of this video is these things happen in different times
They should be happening in those times not this time
Session using cheesy references to a movie from that era about that thing
A movie that was of course a thematic reunion feature for the director and star of another movie that joker takes the bulk of its
Late 70s early 80s reference cues from and very much see how he's very nebulous about what it's taking from taxi driver in king of comedy
Because I hear this all the time. I hear that it's supposed to be copies of it. It's uh
Really close to it people never really
Explain why though and i've never seen these movies. So joker worked perfectly fine for me without me
Seeing these the the quote unquote source material. Well, what you don't realize is joker stole from those films
When you finally watch those which you will
You'll find yourself watching and being like oh my goodness
This is this is this i'd say this is a ripoff of joker if I if I didn't know better but
oh
I guess we'll see I guess we'll see if that's your reaction because I I i've seen taxi driver several times before I saw joker
And uh, yeah, I managed to survive
So
I'm not even sure how at this point because I just keep getting told
That's the case. We'll have a podcast for that one guys. Don't worry
Joker deserves to be looked at as a rip-off of those other films
Well, he's telling me that podcast is not going to be a dressing room again. No, it's
A different youtubers. Not bob. Oh my god. It's okay. Because this guy this guy's oh, I can't believe I made it this far
Much wants you to be thinking of at all times
Taxi driver because that's a great film
Great film about an alienated loner losing his grip on reality and turning to violent power fantasies and an unfeeling urban hellscape
It created the universally understood language of such films and while joker may be running on fumes
Those fumes are an understanding that if it can recite the language phonetically
It doesn't need to understand or speak it you're not saying anything
Just fucking weird salad what he just said is like, uh, so you have a fucking parrot, basically
That's what he that's what he's just associated with joker so that he can repeat the words
There's no idea how how it made them or what they for or what they do
Um, that's an interesting conclusion. You've not provided any evidence for this
I mean, maybe if he actually watched the movie he would understand the movie but
Just frustrates me based on his description of what happens. I don't think he did he thinks he's so clever
By describing a parrot in a really complicated. Well, I say more complicated way than just saying a parrot and uh
But he hasn't supported this at all. He's just said it. It's like good job, man
I could just say the reverse it wouldn't make any sense
But it's not unheard of on efap the idea that something ripped off something that came after it
Does anyone know what i'm referencing? Hey jay log. Are you there for that?
You remember what i'm talking about fucking robocop was
Oh
For getting this I don't remember if I was on that show so he said that star wars ripped off robocop. Oh god
Robocop came after it
How could you make that claim
This one that wasn't made with he just he didn't he didn't think he didn't think about the dates
He just thought it and said it didn't say, you know what? I should go
Who cares about accuracy who cares about references being accurate who fucking cares that's just how we feel
Did movie bob say that or yes remarkable republican. Yeah
Oh
And that is a remarkable claim foreign understanding that if it can recite the language phonetically it doesn't need to understand or speak it
Uh
This is a good thing if there's more clips like this we can just skip over them essentially
Clips to make a time honestly because I really got no idea what this is for
He needs to get it to 10 minutes. Is it to split up the topics?
Also, actually, yeah, if you remove all of the clips, we might have it sink under 10 minutes. You could be right on that
But uh, that's what he's doing
I know he does this in all of his big picture ones that he tries to I think the idea is to break up thoughts
Between sections. I don't know though break up thoughts. I know right
And that's what I mean by this movie not really being about anything because it's all texture with nothing underneath arthur
You haven't proven this
Yeah, tell us why all the things that everybody is saying that it's about are not true
Don't just keep don't just assert blindly that nope. There's nothing here
So he spends the whole fucking video saying it's meaningless, but he hasn't proven any of it
And then you have me like all or whoever else working for hours going through the plot meticulously to get all your evidence to prove
A point and they're like because they made a 10-minute video saying it was meaningful
Just like oh, yeah, repeat that over and over again
Nothing that he has said before this
Supports the idea that there's no meaning
It's because he left out like all of the main details
Like we're we're in the endgame now. This is the the end of the video almost he's going to be wrapping up soon
He don't said anything about anything because it's all texture with nothing underneath it arthur's big speech sounds and directed in his stage
Like a big important scene where something meaningful gets said in a movie like this at this point
The fuck is happening
I don't know
I don't think he watched this movie. He doesn't really say anything. They're a riot. He doesn't say anything
Like like in terms of a meaningful thing. No, remember jenny nickels said that the message was super heavy handed
And she she like she acknowledged it, but she didn't like
Get it, you know, like she said it, but she didn't recognize it
I want to say that he's saying there was nothing really sad and she's saying the message was too obvious
so we're dealing with uh, yeah, how many times in the um, the final scene here the
Where joker is on the show and he's chatting and shitting and all that stuff and jenny talks about how heavy handed it is
And here we have movie bob one of one of her great white knights, right?
Saying that there's no meaning here. There's no message. There's nothing
so it could simultaneously be
empty and heavy handed and obvious
This is hurtful
It's where the action and score tell us society has broken down, but we don't know what not broken meant in this world
It's grimy and what?
You know what a not broken world is?
Why'd you have to see the world?
Shitty how how do you not know what a not broken world is is all the bad stuff minus that the bad stuff
Let's help him out
Okay
So social programs that are actually instated and are functioning well people getting paid and respected for their jobs
People who are kind to each other during traveling or meeting each other
All of your standard sort of societal interactions running well and people respecting each other. That's the world the joker wants
Yeah, everyone's making money. They're pursuing their dreams. They're they're not under
You know duress and stress
You know it's getting along crimes low welfare is down because people don't need it because economy's thriving and all this stuff
You you know what a good
This isn't you know, he wanted was
We needed a prologue dude where it's just a really happy willed everything's happy and great and then it says 10 years later
And then we cut to the film
We want to go back to happy fun time
Oh boy
Yeah, I know i'm seeing i've been collecting memes throughout this whole stream and wolf. I think I know which one you just saw
Good. This this is beautiful
I mean, it's not but it but it is
Oh my god, it's jelter in between his tits he's got a turkey
Oh
Tookie there
That that bird flew there thinking it would be shelter
It died it would be absorbed it actually cooked
It it died and then he'll just pluck it out once it's done and eat it
Do you think he like he used his like thumbnail to scrape the skin off the legs?
I like the size of the laptop by the way, that's a big bop. Yeah
Oh my goodness, it's got the right amount of juices for my tits
for my
It's 17 sweat
I just want to thank everyone watching and sending me these memes because otherwise movie bob would have killed me several times by now
She's movie bob the hut
It's like at this point. I'm just like staring at twitter hoping I find more
Memes, it'll make me survive the next minute and a half of this garbage video
You just you always gives me a headache. The reason you don't like his video is because it's terrible
Yes, yeah knew it you you buy us toward good things
Anyway, oh god, oh god, wait, wait, wait, hold on hold someone someone gave
A diabeto another another nemesis to rival professor exercise
Dr. And so
Oh rags doesn't like it i'm sorry
You just don't like it because you didn't come up with
A cry out. Yeah, I wouldn't come up with that
Hmm, I don't know about that myself
I feel like I feel like that's an actual rags joke
I don't know. I feel like I would start making it but I would have I I'd bail out of that
I'd abort mission halfway through and say yeah, you know
Exercise
Um
I feel like there's a there's an excellent joke there. All right, you'll figure it out
Given given time
But we don't know what not broken meant in this world
It's grimy and edgy and poised on the edge of urban apocalypse like early 80s movies were
But without the authentic real world outside the theater context those movies were feeding off of it's just an echo a reference
The equivalent of an old-time video
All right, I just think he's using a comic book template on his footage
I like how he's showing video footage of scenes. He didn't even claim we're in the movie
Well his plot summary was pointless. I don't even know why he had it
Yeah, it is
Worthless because he had to make references to the actual joker. He's at this point. He's just making up things that
Don't happen in the movie
But he's showing video
So that way we can
You
And what little semblance of a point it does offer to make contradicts what little text it actually has
Arthur all the bellows that society turned him into the joker
But we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother that was primarily responding. Wow
Is he really trying to put
What happened to arthur all all on his mom. Yeah, that's this this informs it all guys his previous video
He said it's all because of a woman
And so here we go. This is deleted scenes. This is how you rationalize it
Oh my god, his mom paid off the kids in the beginning his his mom
Told the clown to sell him the gun
His mom is the one that
Beat him when he was a child and tied him up to a furnace his mom is the one that did everything bad to him ever
Okay, great and the fact that his mom
Dealt with a system that couldn't take care of her as well. That's her fault
His mom, uh also gave that tape to murray
And she told murray to laugh roast like roast his ass
My son he needs a lesson
Oh my god man like
This is why this is why we do this when they just they watched the movie but they didn't
That happens more times than it should but it happens
It seems like it happens all the time where we have to ask. Did you watch the movie you're trying to tell us about?
Because we watched the movie and we just don't follow at all with anything that you're saying
Oh movie
Even if it's a movie, I don't like i'll watch it a couple times so I can soak up everything
So I know what i'm talking about when i'm when I talk about it. This dude's like well, you know, fuck it, you know
It's about nothing. I'll just make a video after probably watch it once
The mob was behind it all she puppeteered everything
She was the criminal mastermind
Joker so skinny i'm so jealous. I'm gonna make a video trash this movie. I wish I could find my bones
Find my bones
Um
Yeah, let's play it again. Make sure that's what he said pretty clear
But hey what little text it actually has arthur all but bellows that society turned him into the joker
But we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother that was primarily
Responsible for like 90 percent of what I like how he says it's just his mother that was primarily
Responsible for the drinks like oh, so there was secondary things
No
No, that's not what I meant
Well, it's like this thing. Everyone's been saying you're taking words from my mouth hole and you're twisting them
No one takes things from my mouth hole
And he said 90 percent. How do you qualify that he qualify? Seriously? I didn't even hear that
Hang on i'm just gonna play it so everyone hears it turned him into the joker
But we and he just got done finding out that it was actually just his mother that was primarily responsible for like 90 percent
Of what happened? How the fuck did he qualify?
Exactly
So nine out of ten things that happened to him are his mother. All right
That's definite. That's definitely that can definitely be supported by scenes from the film
It's like the kids to beat him up his mom had uh
Gave the gun to I don't remember the character's name, but the other clown this is like a scene
Which is like arthur you should take the gun to your job with the children
Do it
I don't know bob. This sounds like a bad idea
What movie did you watch bob
All right, little ikes I want you to beat the shit out of my son
He needs to learn this twisted version of the truman show she's just like how much can we do until this motherfucker snap
In the end she's in the hospital and they're like, why did you do this to him?
She's like I was bored in the credits role
Yeah, I wanted amusement arthur
The movie bob's like wow, it was like mostly her it's like 90 percent of her
I was bored and now i'm dead
It's fucking worth it. I tell you
What a weird world he lives in
And he killed her for it
in fact
If you pull out the ultimately meaningless references to other movies and comic book easter eggs and ignore the
Filmmakers and warner brothers marketing have claimed the movie is about and just went by what's on screen
You might conclude that joker is just a straightforward if pointedly extra misogynist serial killer
Oh
He's like aside from everything else no reference watch about me it's like go fuck yourself you did not watch this
Supporting the other claim. So why would we expect him to support that? Okay
So you're telling me that arthur a guy that you know, he lives with his mother. He takes care of his mother
She's in bed. He washes her. He feeds her. He does everything to provide for his mother
uh, he you know
Makes up this whole relationship with a girl because he have her
He hates her. That's why he was being a relation
And the relationship he makes up is like romantic it's never sexual gross
Or fetishy. It's just like this
He just wants to love someone and to be loved in return
His fantasy with murray has them hug
How
That's misandry
He's not gonna hug a woman
Okay rags using using all of your movie bulb
Known thing. How do you think he would rationalize the film is misogynist?
because he killed his mother
and there were other people who did bad things to him that he
Didn't kill and therefore i got one
He's being unfair to his mother. So the woman was used as an object of desire
Instead of having a character
He wanted a he wanted a a healthy relationship
with a woman
Hmm what a piece of shit
Movie pop doesn't know what a relationship with a woman is cut him some slack. Oh that poor man like
I just
I I don't know what it is about him, but every time we watch a video with him. He literally makes me physically ill
I um
Let's let's get his let's see if he explains what I feel like
Like he listened to a video from him
He's like sitting next to the fourth nuclear reactor in Chernobyl for like an hour
This is so painful
There is uh, just i've been i've been provided an image that uh, I think you guys will appreciate okay
It will it'll make you feel better, right?
Okay, here we go you guys ready
Yes
Oh my god
Oh
Oh my goodness
Three amigos. Oh, this is his arc. It's across the trilogy of movie about films
Oh my god
It's a patrol on the street to sweat in the sheet. Look at the wheel. Look at the wheels on the tricycle thing
Oh
One wheel's about to fall off too
Oh
Oh my god bayouin you're the greatest thing that's ever happened to this world and I love you goodness
Why are you so good at drawing fat people?
Yeah potato shacks when you put on them
Oh
Maybe this is describing so you got like the genre films you got like your noir movie bob film
You're uh, your superhero movie bob film with that your sci-fi movie bob film
He's a very versatile actor you see
Um, yes intense stuff no doubt
Okay, here we go
A drama about how the abused infantilized arthur belatedly achieved psychotic manhood as the confident swaggering joker
By escaping and killing the controlling abusive mother figure who'd infantilized him in the first place
Oh, so that is the justification for misogyny then he killed his mom
Simple as that
Because he's not on his medication because the system cancelled it
And so he doesn't have the help and you know therapy and medication
He needs and finds out that his mom let somebody abuse him in his whole life been like a
Wow, that's so fucking misogynist that he snapped like that
This man's brain is crisco. You can't have characters. Okay having characters is evil
It has to be about the fact that they're men and women
Now I don't know if that's the movie they intended to make
But that's the movie they kind of made
Now look
This is not like I take two of my joker review where I basically said it was mediocre and too empty to be upset about
or so you pretty much said yes, so
Pretty much is doubling down on anything else
I sincerely felt that the manner in which the film managed to be
Self-righteously bland was worthy of a more in-depth elaboration. And this was that he calls this an elaboration
Oh my god, he doesn't he doesn't know what these words mean
Surprising to say the least
I also don't think it was a film made lazily or with cynical intent
It's very possible that all of these less than functional decisions that I've observed were made with high-minded
Intentions and that todd phillips etc. And the other filmmakers have very detailed heartfelt explanations for each one
But the thing about explanations is
Well, you want to take this one? Mr. J. If you have to explain a joke
Um, yeah, that's stop
So just because you don't understand it doesn't mean nobody understands it bob
He clearly doesn't everyone is as stupid as you yeah
I'm bob and that's the big picture
The only thing that's big about this picture is the size of the man that's telling it I am disappointed
There's no apology at the end of the video
Sorry, you watched this
I'd appreciate that. I think it'd be good for all of us
Oh god
That hurt my brain. You did it. We killed him
Oh my god
It wasn't easy why is he like this I don't know
Why can't he just be a normal person why does he have to be something the worst thing on youtube
Someone chained him to a radiator and beat him with broccoli
And now he's some badass
It was a particularly tough branch of broccoli
No, please
I died
Um
There's not much else to say he's
We've covered him quite a few times at this point and it's just the same shit
Uh in fairness there was there was less of the crazy amount of um
Like loads of big words in one big set
What was the because he had a crazy one that made it into gedelb too because it was so out there
We had to like write it all down
Um, you didn't do it this time. I like how this is written and edited by bob shipman like that was an achievement
I would not
Put my name on anything that was remarkable
Congratulations bob you did the bare minimum you wrote your video and you edited your video
Congratulations, you're a youtuber
technically
By technicality you are a youtuber. Oh, thanks
Oh, but anyway, we we have a main course that was the small video
No, we're doing more the thing is
Bob is tough not to pause. This one is
Dare, I say it a better video
Um
It's just we're watching a good one
I have two and a half hours left
Oh, I have to do my other show
I was gonna say just let me know when you want to hop out and then uh, that'll be that'll be fine
You made it through a whole movie about video you you've earned the right
um
but yeah, this is uh
This is there's a channel called nando versus movies and what he does is look at a movie finds
Let's say a part of it that's lacking and he tries to make up for that with a sort of a reedit suggestion
He has one for joker. And I guess i'm more interested in
What wolf will think of his fixes? Um
Sorry, it's just a good video or is this a bad video?
I'm not gonna make that claim. It'll be up to the see how it goes. Shall we we'll just check out what he has to say
His eyes are boring into my soul
Yeah, stop looking at me like that. Also who needs to go on let's come on now
I don't know. There's some there's something about this guy
Something's heaven's heaven's gate cult territory
All right, oh god he could be
Cry five and I would believe it. Look at jay. You're covering dad though. He's a good. All right. All right. All right
Let's check it out
Hi, I just wanted to say two things first
This video is full of spoilers for the movie joker
Which should not be a huge surprise since this video is about the movie joker
But still I figured it was worth saying second at the end of this video
I'm going to talk about a couple things that aren't important to me
So even if you don't usually watch the entire video i'd really appreciate it if you did this time
Okay
Cyanide is important
Oh my goodness
Before we get started i've got to give joker some credit
Walking phoenix did a phenomenal job with arthur from the voice to the mannerisms to the laugh
He completely sold the character and deserves all of the praise he is getting hilder. Gonna dot their score was also amazing
And finally how are you pronouncing that?
I'm gonna go ahead and say probably I have no idea. Okay. I I genuinely don't know how to pronounce her name
I wish I did
But I looked at her last name and I was like, oh I can't i'm not even gonna try
It has a bunch of like accents and shit that don't make sense to me
All right
Fine and cinematography did that thing that all good batman movies need to do
They made gotham city into a character seems like a cliche, but it is legitimately very important
Especially in this movie and I think joker handled gotham city very well with all that being said
I had quite a few problems with joker almost all of which stemmed from what I would argue was a pretty shallow script
Joker takes swings some complicated topics, but I think it misses almost all of them
Why why can't we have good things?
Joker takes swings a lot of complicated topics and misses all of them. That's what he said
Quite the claim
Why
Is it that all of the people who like the last jedi in this shit really hate this movie?
Why do you people exist? I don't know if he liked tlj. Honestly
He might have
Hold on i'm gonna look at this channel and i'm gonna guess that he does
I can't substantiate is substantiate because i've never heard of him
Well jay said he's a good channel jay would know jay. Does he like tlj? Tell us reveal to us
He just said nando no
You were the chosen one
It's okay, it's okay
All right
Uh
He doesn't have many videos actually
He doesn't have anything on tlj. No, he does
Apparently he did not like it. That's it
Apparently he didn't like it. Apparently he didn't like it
It's okay
It's okay for now and i'll forgive you a little bit
Three videos telling people why aquamans shit from what I would argue was a pretty shallow script joker takes swings
It's some complicated topics, but I think it misses almost all of them from mental health to corruption to society
I think joker raised mental health corruption and society apparently missed all of them. Oh
Oh my god
Like really?
I don't know madly none of them
Oh apparently there's a quote from him saying a lot of ways star wars the last jedi succeeded
Jay you lied to us
Well
What do you know? It's almost like there's a trend of certain people
I guess that doesn't necessarily mean he liked it, right? He could just be saying that he didn't like it
But it is achieve achieve stuff. I don't fucking know
But it didn't succeed in any way it didn't succeed at all
I don't know
He didn't hate it. He didn't like it. Okay, he's uh, he's middling on it
Oh
It misses almost all of them from mental health to corruption to society
I think joker raises many issues that it is not prepared to adequately address
And maybe my biggest individual issue with joker concerns arthur himself
He holds extreme views which he uses to justify his actions, which would usually be a good thing
I want a protagonist with strong beliefs like batman
And especially if the protagonist is an anti-hero like how han believes he can't look up mentioning batman
I'm talking about this fucking movie
Every single time everyone has a stupid opinion about this movie they bring up batman
He said the joker has extreme views is he referring to awful people should be killed as a view
Guessing
Doesn't he realize that the joker actually has a character arc in this movie and that he changes based on the information he's given
It just reminded me of uh, I don't know if you've seen the red light media video, but
j of red light media not j xy said uh
You know arthur starts out so downtrodden that his character has nowhere to go
And then mike is like no
And then he goes what he goes joker
He becomes joker
So
For yourself or even a villain like how danos holds some pretty strong beliefs about the universe and balance
It is not a problem that arthur believes that the rich and powerful are making life worse for
The rest of us and it is not a problem that he takes that belief to the extreme
And uses that belief to justify murder and inciting a riot. That's good
He comes to that belief later on in the movie if you actually watch it because he says
So many times. I don't care about politics. I don't care about any of that stuff
I just want to make people smile and laugh
And then when he learns out the shit about his mom when he goes and connects thomas wane when he loses his medication when he
loses his therapy
Everything adds up if you actually watch the fucking movie and pay attention to the fucking movie
You would know these things who is this person so I can avoid their channel?
It's only two minutes we can give him a chance. I don't know i'm waiting for qualifications. I'm not gonna be a lot here
So far he's not moving bob
I don't care. I just when I hear this point i'm like, did you watch it?
um
He's like he's like it's good that he holds the view that uh, it's fine. Oh, well not good morally but uh
Holds the views that the rich people are fucking up the poor people and that's good enough reason to kill them
I mean
I'm trying to think of like
End of the movie though, and he wasn't gonna kill them. He was gonna kill himself
And he makes that decision last minute when he realizes he can't kill himself and he's just like fuck it
And then he he kills murray
Yeah, and he definitely has the line about like how you you all walk past me sort of thing and that
I I think i'm gonna let him speak for some more because i'm just like
Yeah
A good way for a real person to act but it's good that arthur has that reaction because it raises interesting questions
However, I believe joker fails when it comes to doing anything interesting with those questions
It feels content with saying that people are bad and arthur is bad and maybe he's right. Who knows who can what?
They show why people are bad
Maybe he's right that everyone's bad
But not everyone's even that he literally spares somebody in this film for not being bad
Oh my god
Do I have to watch this i'm sorry
This is awful. Why did you do this to us?
There's a lot of bad joker takes
This is we're 23 seconds. Oh, no, we're 20 what 22 minutes or two minutes in a 23 minute video. God damn it
This is definitely an issue of like come on the film wouldn't be saying everyone's bad
There's a seed devoted to the idea that a good person gets spades. I don't
Cares joker doesn't spend much time examining arthur's books critically outside of murray at the very end of the movie
Very briefly. No one stands up to arthur challenges his beliefs
And i'm not saying that nobody knows nobody fucking knows because it's all in his fucking head
Well, you know people that do stand up to him are they die because he kills him
Not to me. I I really want to ask this guy like okay, so tell me what you believe joker's beliefs are
and then uh
conclude that nobody
Like i'm trying to figure out that the formula here because he's saying that he isn't challenged on his belief his belief that what?
That society is kind of shit right now
And that um didn't murray challenge his beliefs went right before he got his head blown off
Well, he says he says it like it doesn't count very briefly murray questions him and he's the only one to question him
It's like we'll know shit. It's because he doesn't know that he's a
psychopath killer
He reveals that right before he kills everyone. I would actually argue that it's murray's challenge that like
Crystalizes joker the fact that he's the his him addressing arthur like that made arthur fucking pissed
Yeah, and arthur's pretty much like an invisible invisible to everyone else
So of course no one would challenge him because no one else fucking sees how
No one has his lunacy is growing and no one
Person like an idiot
And i'm not saying that every movie needs to be a debate where opposing views are presented and a winner is decided
But it does make the story pretty flat if the protagonist does not meet with any real opposition
Doesn't meet with any opposition
Any ideological foil, you know like the one at the end who told him to his face that not ever
You don't know me joker
Why are you people still it doesn't count. Well, it wasn't long enough
No
Isn't like as someone's just highlighted in chat isn't the fact that people are ignoring him a part of it
a part of his issues
Like he's not seen not right then. That's why dancing on the car at the end
This is like a dream come true because he's the center of attention
You
Challenged his views are you saying that the audience needs like let's look at um
We need someone to tell him that mass murdering is bad
We are so stupid that if we don't have someone telling us that mass murder is bad
Then it means that we're all going to become mass murderers because the people that don't like these this movie
Are so stupid that they can't even understand what the movie was about in the first place seems to be arguing for like
Interest level like it's not interesting to not have him challenged. It's too shallow or whatever. I'm just like, I don't agree. Oh my god
Wolf is turning into the joke by your definition. What movie has
I want to see this guy. Give me a comparison if he's saying that the joker is lacking these things
Show me one that isn't so I can see what your level of you know
Actual comprehension he's gonna reference taxi driver and king of comedy because that's what everyone does
i'm sorry
No ideological foil feels shallow like let's look at murray's exchange with arthur for one second
Okay, the most complete attempt joker makes it calling arthur out murray says are you finished?
I mean, it's so much self-pity arthur. It sounds like you're making excuses for killing those young men
Not everybody and i'll tell you this not everybody is awful. My dinner was pretty great
That's a good point and I wish one joker spent more time with it could be said
What do you mean joker actually agrees with not everyone's awful?
He says it
Spares someone's life for being kind and then he calls murray out
He says yeah, I know not everyone's and then he's but look at you
You brought me on here to make fun of me. You know, he calls him out on his own hypocrisy
Did we watch the same fucking movie bro?
Part of
I'm, not sure what this guy's after we're gonna understand this better and better as we go along. I think you know
It's pretty great
That's a good point
And I wish one joker spent more time with it could be said that arthur is using self-pity as an excuse to act without
Consequences. However murray is the wrong messenger to deliver that message and this is where joker's
Shallowness becomes an issue because in joker everyone is awful like no
No, but carry on you're wrong to carry on
Cartoonist area wasn't awful woman on the bus is rude to arthur
That's not cartoonishly awful plenty of parents want to keep people who look weird away from their kids
Yeah, and she gave him a sympathetic look after reading the card and figuring out
Oh, there's just something mentally wrong with nothing cartoonish about her
That's you need to go to a bus stop and stare at somebody for a few seconds and see what happens
Even though he's just trying to make the kid laugh
Arthur's so us is rude to arthur even though he's just trying to make the kid laugh
Arthur's social worker doesn't listen to him those kids arthur social worker doesn't listen to him
That's the only thing we get to hear about that
I dare say it's tad more complicated than that
Good job is to listen and reflect on him and try and improve him when her job is getting taken away with
Just as much as his medication is in a city that doesn't care about her or him. She's very
It's supposed to reflect the idea like the idea is like oh the therapist doesn't care about him
We dealt with this with jenny. It's like are you aware of like therapists that aren't even particularly great at their jobs
Or therapists that aren't actually supposed to be doing these jobs. She's a social worker and she's trying to
Be the person that can bring joker back together
Like from his mental breakdown someone
Has someone who has had several therapists?
None of which really said anything more than the exact same things that you could just find for free on a youtube video
This is a thing that happens
Okay, therapists don't generally care
Not everything is like goodwill hunting. I'm sorry to break it to you
Just like um, and this is this is his list of like you see, um, these people don't
Like this this is a society that's ridiculous. Like why is it and jenny said the same thing
It was like you could jenny actually said you could see one of these things happening
You can't see all of them happening in like a small amount of time
Society can suck man, and I hate the like we don't even have to use the word because it's too meme-y
But uh, yeah, also j-long bone shall return from what I understand
Anyway
Steal arthur's sign and beat him up for seemingly no reason arthur's
Um, okay, god damn. I actually feel like kind of a dick at this point
So just like you just raw got everything. So have you guys ever heard of kids?
Uh, like delinquents doing something just to be mean as a group. Oh my god. Just just pull up that video that you uh,
Just pull up that video that you uh
Oh, did anna leave?
Yeah, we've lost it was just me and you know well
Oh, we got j-long back hello
Hello, we lost you and anna it was terrifying
Well, you can just pull up that video that you showed me in rags earlier kid that like was getting
Beat up for like no reason and then he goes and beats up all the other kids. Actually. Yeah, let's
I you've made me want to pull that video. Yeah, see if I can find it
Incredibly applicable here
If you guys want to see like the best sense of justice ever, this is gonna be it
Do uh, do you know where it is? I'm trying to find it
It was before
It was because I remember sending you the pothole one, oh there it is I found it
Okay, give me a second chat
So the question is would kids really be such means
Would they really let me i'll give you the link to you guys as well
Oh unless you already post it. Um, so this is the link
No thingy I can put that back on
Um, do you want to sync it up?
Yes, hold on i'll pull it up right now
All right, i'm on zero on the video, okay, so
Uh, oh that doesn't look quite right does it
Yet
Still see the movie ball picture
Um, all right three two one go
Can you hear me
Uh, give us just give us uh 30 seconds or so
That was a fucking hot
What he curb stumps the kids face it's so satisfying
So yeah, uh kids can be assholes
Like that's kind of the point we're getting back here
Uh, and if they're in a group where they're encouraging each other to be even more assholey
Like look at the clown guy with the sign
I'm gonna distract him one of you knock the sign out of him and then we'll run with it
If he fucking chases us we'll talk about with it. Why the hell not?
um
So the idea is like why are they doing this the children have no motivation to do this like dude
Yeah, I mean it's just like it's this they don't need a motivation if they feel like doing it
They'll do it just to fuck with you. What about
Dog in the dryer. Do you guys remember seeing that video?
What?
Yeah, this girl on it like her instagram, uh, like story thing
She did instagram live and she puts her dog in the dryer
And she laughs about it
Oh, oh and fuck. Do you remember the the youtuber as well who like
spat on a dog
Yeah, I remember covering that yeah, I remember that
I like that and we established this is a terrible city
Like I said, it's worse than you just have these youtubers who are like people aren't this made. Why would you do this?
What what kind of sheltered life do you live in?
Where you think that's exactly the point. They don't know that bad stuff happens in the world because they're so fucking sheltered
It's like walk down a bad, you know street and you're gonna learn that not everything's all sunshine and daisies real fast
Yeah, this guy's soundproof walls actually become really symbolic
Those kids steal arthur's sign and beat him up for seemingly no reason
Arthur's boss blames arthur for what happened to the sign even though why would arthur steal a going out of business sign?
Arthur's co-worker lies about giving arthur the gun thomas wayne is a jerk. Wait, is that
Like something that he thinks shouldn't have happened the lying about giving the gun thing
He says it like is he just labeling things that are bad now
I don't know like i'm just
Look, okay. So if you admit that they've been passing I was gonna say like what the fuck would you admit to that?
Like you're fucking dangerous
It'd be even worse nowadays with all the gun control shit like if you're passing guns around people like, you know, you're fired
Get the fuck out. That's that's gonna scare people
and uh
Yeah, you not only did that he also said that uh, he claimed that uh arthur tried to buy the gun off him, right?
Like he double screwed him
I think did he say buy the gun or buy the bullets? I can't remember. Oh, um, I guess it doesn't really matter because I think he says
You think he said you tried to buy a gun off him a week ago the implication being he refused that gun
And then joker got one from somewhere else
That sort of thing. Um
Um
Apparently
I'm being told we shouldn't be making arguments that these things happen in real life and thus they're okay to happen in the film
We should be arguing from in universe
Okay, so are you just gonna
Let's be nice, right? So there are human beings in this film being no, no, we're not gonna be nice
This is this is like really retarded point
Like it's fucking Gotham. It's one of the most violent crime ridden places in fucking fiction
that like you can't
You can't compare it to real life. Well, yeah, you're fucking right because Gotham is worse than real life
Well, here's the thing like what can you name one thing that happens in this movie that is unrealistic to real life
Uh riots they only happen in 2000s plus
Sorry, it's a bad point because we're talking about human beings in this film being depicted
We're drawing real life references to what human beings do and say an act
There's a reason why so if you go strictly from in universe rules, then we have to start wondering. So is this species human?
I don't know. They haven't declared that in the film yet
Obviously we take stuff from real life in order to apply rules
What fiction needs to do is tell us when they deviate from real life if they're depicting something close to it
So like if you have a fictional world like lupa, for example
Everything is mostly the same except there's time travel and people have telekinesis
And so they do they try and establish that very quickly because everything else is the same
You'll understand everything else. Just make sure you get those things. So the idea that it's like people aren't this mean it's like
Yes, they are
That's that's that's the point we're making you can't appeal to real life and call this unrealistic because life is this cruel as well
But we wouldn't say the film is good because it's depicting people being mean and people are mean in real life
That's not the argument we're making. We're just trying to establish that saying it's unrealistic is inaccurate
Yep
And you can absolutely appeal to real life if you're trying to define whether or not something is possible
in a film that's essentially grounded that
That's kind of where I was going with that there's this there's a principle you can apply to lots of different things like that, um
Like I said lord of the rings is in trouble because it's almost all
Without understanding what life is the only thing you really retain in stuff like lord of the rings
It's like oh, well character people work a certain way like they do in real life
And so you need to be realistic. So it's like oh, so it's on lord of the rings to explain fucking everything
Like you got
What are all the species? How do they all hang out?
Where all the places where all the rules or the borders what's all the powers?
It's like yeah
That's why you need to be a fucking great writer to get all of that shit sorted before you can even start telling your story
Wolf, do you know of lord of the rings? I think you'd like it
Yes, I do know of it. Oh sweet. Do you know of the hobbit movies? I think you'd like it
Unfortunately
Anyway
about giving arthur the gun thomas wayne is a jerk he hits arthur and possibly
Okay
Let's do this one too
So you find out that a crazy man came to your house
He put his hands in your child's mouth and he strangled almost to death your butler
And then he comes to you personally and says daddy
Uh, I mean
Oh my god, not saying that thomas wayne isn't a jerk in this film that's fine
I don't mind that but the idea that he punched him for like no reason or something. It's like there's there's a reason
The fact that he only punched him should say a lot about thomas wayne's restraint
He talked to him for a minute or two
He explained to him that his mom, you know was not telling him the truth and he got his buttons pushed and then he punched him
It's like come on context, dude. You have to have the context there
Yeah, because this is all he's
Go ahead. I was gonna say you think he get his bodyguards to take him outside and beat the shit out of him for a little while
And uh, this is all to aid in the idea that the world is like cartoonishly cruel or whatever oh my
Um, the the idea of the world is cartoonishly cruel that it's just like no you've highlighted a bunch of things that make sense. Uh
The gun left thomas wayne is a jerky hits arthur and possibly lies about being arthur's father
Murray makes fun of arthur an aspiring stand-up comedian at an open mic
Who clearly has some sort of mental health or neurological issues? It's not clear at all
And I don't know is it so
Does it make you cruel to
Consume and critique someone else's work because I don't know guys
I don't know. What are we doing right now?
We're satan family if you criticize someone you are the embodiment of satan
Well, we did drive tonaled off the internet I guess we are
I actually am so sad about that
Still tonaled come back
You're my favorite person on the face of youtube
I need you to come back
Come back on national television and arthur's mom may have lied to arthur about his father
Why does he keep saying may have for these things we know the answer
So this is what i've heard online
So if you say if you cite the papers at arkham they say that thomas wayne could have paid to have them doctored
Based off of what the fact that he's rich and evil
Yeah, I mean some people have theories that um
She like they did fuck and then it did result in the kid, but the kid was fucked up
Thomas wayne wasn't fucking with the mentally ill kids like it
And then like no you don't you take the kid crazy lady and then fuck off and that's that that's some theories i've heard
I mean I just I don't think
I need to watch the film again to get a full refresh, but
Whatever that's not the point he's making right now. Anyway, he's trying to say that everything's mean and it
I guess i'm waiting for him to say like it's unrealistic or something out his father and on top of all of that
And I know how dumb this sounds but society seems to have left arthur behind. Oh, wow
I feel like the point of the movie
The mental health program is shut down
There's a garbage strike super rats an out of touch plutocrat is running for mayor
And the citizens of gotham has become a violent mob
Everyone is awful and that gives joker an excuse not to question arthur's beliefs
It's too simple an interesting move
wait, so like
The problem is that
It's implied that he just should start shooting people
Is that what he's trying to say like oh he concludes after all of this
Yeah, he's just gonna start shooting people live on air
He's gonna incite riots and the film isn't saying anything about how wrong that is. It's like
Emi
I've got some arguments for why those sorts of things can end badly. Um
But this is kind of where i'm at in terms of this movie being
It doesn't want to take a side and definitively claim
That either the people or the rich the class divide like one of them is right
Because I don't I think the film's point is that neither of them are right
And so the idea that he's not challenged enough is thomas wayne challenged enough
Because he was killed accounts as some form of a challenge, right?
Only in your subjectively objective opinion
All right then
An interesting movie would feature a more complex society and it's easy to compare joker to the two movies that it's clearly
borrowing a lot of its themes and visuals and actors from
Taxi drive. Hey, it's like bingo at this point. So if I was actually doing it, you know, like when I did okay, go ahead
At this point i've never seen king of comedy i've never seen taxi driver
I don't even really know too much of scorsese's works
But at this point it's like i'm gonna like probably hate this movie or these movies
Just like to spite these people
They keep getting brought up. I mean I watched
Comedy and I didn't like it, but i'm not I do not like scorsese movies
And I was told the only reason I watched king of comedy was because I was told that
This movie seemed like it was going to be a similar plot and while there's you know, similar
Things about it. I feel like the joker is different enough
Um
Reminds me of well
I like the both of them. I think that they're very strong. I actually uh would say that
Taxi driver is better than I like it
And what I mean by that is I don't like it as much as I think it is very good
I just it doesn't I don't respond very well to travis pickle as a character. I don't really like him
Um, it's kind of like denarius up until season eight where I was like, I think she's perfectly well written
I just don't like her
And you might be like be like joker be like yeah, I kind of like arthur
I can I can see how all of it worked out and I think that
There could have been a good guy there. Um, I don't really feel the same way about travis pickle
But that's a whole other fucking conversation same for rupert pupkin, by the way. He's uh, the character from
king of comedy
We need more
You know like how I reference a new hope I
reference the shit out of it when i'm talking about tfa copying it because there are like
Specific events and like at the point i'm trying to make in my tfa series was that they copy them
but then they don't copy the mechanics that led to these events and so their story is like worse for it because they
Kind of like the parrot thing that movie bob was saying
Where you you take the parts that everyone remembers and you put them in yours
But you don't earn your way there and so you just got this hollow copy and that's what a lot of people feel about tfa
And I think it's very provable
With taxi driver and king of comedy the best people have is king of comedy a guy who wants to be on a tv show
That's very comedy focused. It's like oh like how arthur wants to get on murray's show rip off
It's like you gotta be more specific than that. That's way too fucking broad taxi driver a guy who is
Well, I was about to say down in his luck. He's not really he chooses he's he's actually quite rich. He admits to this
He's got uh, well not rich, but he's he's got a lot of funds. He doesn't know what to do with
He's a taxi driver that works a lot of hours. He's in a world that he sees
um
as like disgusting and and depraved but he only
Views the world from specific angles like he goes to the depraved areas. He goes out at night. So he's very biased and uh
He gets there's a lot of complicated elements to a to taxi driver that I probably shouldn't go into right now
We'll save it for when we go over a bigger podcast about
These two films and how joker's not a fucking rip off of them
But my issue is it's just like they usually go surface level with how it's a um
A clone and it's really bothering me because I feel like you should put a lot more effort in than just fucking echoing
What every single other person fucking says which is
Joke's like taxi driver. Joke's like a comedy. No, he might do right. So we'll give him a shot here. But um
I've seen the both of these films. I know them relatively well. So we should be able to survive this portion of the the video
And visuals and actors well what I meant by the way, but the not down in his luck is the
Arthur totally is to an extreme degree. They're not in the same situation. They're not in the same cities
That's kind of where I was going with that from taxi driver and the king of comedy both
Scorsese masterpieces about an out-of-touch loner and society
However, I think both of those movies do something very specific. The joker does not something
That helps to explore the beliefs of the protagonists their valuing way
So that brings me to my one small change. I believe joker could easily introduce a character who is not awful
It doesn't have to be perfect
I can't with these I can't with these stupid takes
All right, we're gonna let him continue, but we will we will put a notation
We will put a notation
We will put a notation. There is a seed that explicitly states
There is a goodman and he is spared because he is a goodman
Just putting it out there
I'm gonna let you continue
That's a footnote
Who is not awful doesn't have to be perfect just someone that can call him on his bs
We can use that character to learn more about arthur and society get a more nuanced view on all of the themes of the movie
In taxi driver. This character is betsy played by civil shepherd the palantine and joker
It's robert deniro and gary
So almost like you didn't watch the movie you simpleton
It's like they want
It's like they want joker to have some kind of fucking sidekick like some kooky sidekick who makes jokes and shit like
Come on, man. Go talk to the girl man. Stop stalking her man
Yeah
For reference for you guys
She's she's working on palentine's goal to to become local like I think he might be running for president
I can't remember. It doesn't matter. Um
He like stalks her at first
Travis pickle and then he asks her out they talk about a lot of different things they go to um
You want to date?
He takes her on a date to see a porno
And she's like what the fuck and then she doesn't want to talk to him ever again because she realizes he's a fucking freak
Or doesn't understand social cues to a degree. Let's put it that way
um, and he doesn't get it like there's this
The conversation in the film where he's like don't people go to see stuff like this and it's just because he's he's got a very warped view
of reality
um
She I don't know if I go as far as saying she really calls out his ideas. There's no real debate between them. Um
He gets to the point where he fucking hates her and it's very irrational
Uh because he's a very complicated person. I don't know. I don't know if i'd describe it as she's um
She's his opposite in the film. She does there's certain bits of dialogue that i'd say are challenging his ideas, but i'm
I'm also curious what exactly he means by having a character that what would what would this theoretical character talk to joker about?
Like you realize society isn't that bad, right?
Be like, okay. Thanks like
Like arthur you realize not mentally ill there's a lot of good people out there arthur and he's just like great
I look forward to meeting them one day
Travis pickle pickle pickle, but uh travis pick prickle
um
This is the thing like this is very
Uh, I guess half baked would be the choice of words i'd have i'm still maybe he's gonna explain it. I'll just let him carry on
Who travis courts goes on a date with and then embarrasses himself in front of taxi driver is about this dirty
disgusting version of new york that travis hates and wants to clean up and that belief isn't necessarily held by betsy
But she is also working for a politician who wants to make changes
So she represents the idea of change and her and travis get along
until
She exposes the contradiction at the heart of travis
He thinks new york is a dirty disgusting mess that he also participates in he takes her to the pornographic movie theater on a date
And that highlights the fact that travis takes part in this system that he believes needs to be destroyed
I don't know that to a degree sure but uh, it's also travis doesn't understand what's wrong
Uh, he this is like it's very explicit. He's like
This is something that people do and then even on their way into the to the show or movie
She's like, uh, are we gonna see like a normal movie and then he's like, no, no, no
I and he literally says I see couples seeing this stuff all the time like he's based
What he how he operates in society from what he's seen
Um while simultaneously not realizing that all he views is like the underbelly sort of thing
um
but i'm still
Curious where he's going with this exactly
That's why he can't go on a date with and have a normal relationship with betsy
It's the internal contradiction of travis pickle and you can only get at that with a character like betsy
I didn't get at that through here. It was through the movie
You see him make a lot of decisions that push him into that direct
I feel bad obviously because you i'm assuming all three of you haven't seen taxi drivers
So i'm the only one who can really comment on this portion. Uh, I i've seen it
But it was like a long time ago like when I was the kid
Um watch this as a kid
Yeah
I I guess in fairness I watched alien when I was yeah, I watched a lot of ties to me
um
Yeah, the point being is that uh, you you can tell by watching the film that he's a contradictive human being. Uh
He has a lot of harsh views that aren't exactly uh fueled by anything
Strictly coherent. It's a like I said, it's a really good film
I just don't um, I don't agree that joker is improved by having a character that tells him hey
Maybe you shouldn't hate society as much as you do because it's not all bad
I don't I don't know. I don't understand how joker benefits from that
Who exists outside of that world and can highlight travis's contradiction
The same can be said of diane abbot's rita keen in the king of comedy
In the king of comedy robert de niro plays rupert pumpkin an aspiring stand. Oh
But he's a stalker in that movie
Rupert
His name is pupkin
And there's a joke in the film where everyone pronounces his name wrong and one of the wrong pronunciations is pumpkin
And he just said pumpkin
Hmm damn you you're supposed to pay attention his name is rupert pumpkin
It's okay
Yeah
um
I guess yeah, we'll let's see what his description of this is outside of that world and can highlight travis's contradiction
The same can be said of diane abbot's rita keen in the king of comedy in the king of comedy robert
And euro plays rupert pumpkin an aspiring stand-up comedian who is obsessed with talk show host jerry langford
And wants to be on his show and rupert both desperately wants to be a stand-up comedian
But does not want to do the work necessary to be a stand-up comedian
He's very determined when it comes to things like sitting in offices and making sure people get tapes. Doesn't he?
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i'm pretty sure like the opening time
He talks to jerry explains that he's been doing all of the shows and he's not getting anywhere
Yeah, he does and he records his little
Tape so that way he can send him out to places and he's tired of just doing that because he hasn't gotten noticed
So that's why he goes to the office. That's why he's that persistent
That's why he becomes a stalker because he can't make it the regular route that everyone is telling him to
And that's one of the things that he insists on
Even at the end of the movie when he finally goes on the show and he's like the only reason i'm here is because I have
This guy held up at gunpoint you all are laughing now
But you're gonna freak out when you find out that it's true because I did everything right and that didn't work
So I had to go to these extremes
To make this happen and then he writes a book about it and he becomes famous after he gets out of prison
Did this guy not watch this movie either?
I just like
He's uh, he's I think he's trying to slightly twist both of the films to
Really solidly present the argument that the presence of a character that
Uh contradicts them is what made them strong or something like that. But like i'm already rushing ahead in my head here like
um
the character that rita plays uh, she
She's not really in this film that much
She's almost like a tag along basically for reference for the people who haven't seen this film
He um, he tells this girl from high school that he's like super famous and doing great when he's not
He's doing terribly and then um, he imagines a conversation with the tv host
And i'm pretty sure we are. Um, we see we see him imagine it. He's like talking to um
He's like he's he's if I remember he's like in an
Office with jerry and they're like really good friends suddenly
And they're discussing how he's going to go to his mansion and it makes no sense at all like in terms of continuity because jerry
Doesn't even want to get anywhere near him. And so you're like, oh, this is fucking this is in his head
And then we later see him invite. Uh
That character to jerry's mansion or whatever it is and they go there and jerry's like what the fuck are you doing here?
like
like you've just come into my house uninvited because he gets in through like a servant I guess and the and
The idea that the girl is there to challenge him doesn't even make much sense to me because jerry is directly challenging him
He's shouting at him for imagining all this shit, you know, she just she's only there to basically be like, hey
This is fucked up
We shouldn't have just helped her. I apologize. It's like i'm sorry
We'll leave
You know, um someone in chat said rupa was lying. He never performed anywhere. I don't know that we can say that definitively
Can we we don't have any proof of that?
He just because they don't go to show flashbacks or anything. He just says that he's been doing it for a long time
Yeah, I don't I don't know. I don't know. We can I don't know if we can be definitive either way on that one
But uh, it's possible
That he's not determined when it comes to working in comedy clubs and getting there the way all the rest of the comedians do
He instead likes to pretend he's already a part of that world
And that's where diane abbot's rita comes in
An old friend from high school who rupert goes on a date with and during the date
He lies to her about being friends with jerry where a character like sandra bernard's masha
Exists within this diluted celebrity obsessed world
Rita exists outside of it and when rupert does something pretty bizarre like goes to jerry langford's house unannounced
Reed is able to call out how strange that is
Okay, do you see how many people were present in that screenshot?
They're all fucking calling him out. Basically reed is a
You've got two housekeeper people and you've got jerry here and they're all like you're kind of insane having her say it
Honestly, it's kind of less meaningful for her to say it than jerry because jerry is the one that he imagined the conversation with
So to have him directly tell him and he doesn't by the way, he doesn't fucking listen to him
I don't even this isn't really even
What he's saying it is like the idea that a question it provides a counter ideologically to the character's um viewpoint
He denies all of it. Anyway, he find he finds jerry's being extremely rude and that um
The the the girl is sort of like I can't remember specifically, but he's not
This doesn't convince him
Uh pumpkin follows through throughout the whole film. There's never a point where where he thinks, you know what?
Maybe i'm wrong. He literally fucking kidnaps the guy by the end of the film
The only part where he kind of changes is when
The guy tells him I only told you like i'll listen to your tape to get rid of you right?
Yeah, which that doesn't make him better. It makes him worse
But uh, yeah, so it's these this is kind of where i'm at right now in terms of discussing
Taxi driver king of comedy and joker. They are so fucking different
And so you have these people being like oh, I just kind of ripped stuff out of them
I'm like what specific stuff are you talking about?
Like these are very different characters in very different worlds with very different problems
Because the idea is the because pumpkin has imagined stuff
Um, just like joker imagined the girlfriend see that's kind of you see what I mean
And before anyone assumes anything i'm not putting all of these arguments into this guy's video
I'm just saying this is all stuff i've heard around these films
So far the only problem i've got with his assessment is that he's
I don't know missing a couple of things out of both these movies
I'm more curious how he's going to get to um
Uh back to joker, I guess
Reality check who can call rupert on his contradiction
So if I could make one small change to joker, I would introduce a character into the movie. Well, that's not exactly right
I would not
Unintroduce a character sophie played by zazzy beats would not spend most of the movie as a hallucination
She would be actually dating arthur for the reason what you have to do that. Oh my god
I like that we're already stuck. Excuse me. Say you're right. We have an issue
Okay, well we'll let him continue because let's just imagine for a second that
She's just dating him from the get-go. We don't even know why they're just a happy couple
Which changes a lot about this film, but okay, that's the case
For those who don't remember or people who haven't seen joker, but don't care
Sophie is a seemingly single mother who lives in arthur's building after a brief friendly interaction arthur follows sophie to her job at the bank
Then she shows up unannounced at arthur's apartment is remarkably cool with being stalked goes with arthur to his open mic night
Goes on another date with arthur meets arthur at the hospital and even does other things
but then arthur goes to sophie's apartment and it is revealed that arthur was
Imagining their interactions the nice girl didn't actually like him cute dumb flashback then maybe oh
That's another one for the bingo board people. Everybody thinks that the flashbacks are dumb
um
They're like knocking you over the head as if we couldn't figure it out. I'm always just like this this
I I and I still stand by what I said the last time I was on
That yeah, I mean
I wish I said it last time
The amount of people that still to this day think that the eagles are a plot hole in the lord of the rings
Is proof enough that you need to explain this shit because the amount of people that pretend that they're smart enough to get this
Still don't get all this shit
It's first off. I mean if it took away from the film, that would be one thing, but it doesn't take away from anything
And also you just stupid
I'm already realizing you have to get that this story no longer works
You have to get you have to have her get killed kidnapped or or she leaves him
You have to have one of those things happen now because he can't have her
and simultaneously hate the world
Because there's a good chance especially if they're in a hell of like a not a healthy relationship but a relationship that's working
Enough that they're together
Then he's gonna find comfort in here, isn't he like that's gonna be
Why they're together?
So doesn't that like severely alter this film to like a drastic degree?
I guess it kind of worked
He wanted to be kind of like uh that animated killing joke movie where he had a kid and a wife
And then oh he loses it and then he goes crazy like which is
Maybe
Maybe he's about to do that in this rewrite like she'll get killed or something
That's all i'm expecting now
She's gonna get killed it'll be helpful because I actually just read the killing joke a few days ago first time so
I haven't seen the movie but people tell me not to so
They're gonna go with that dumb moment because joker trades an interesting character
Who also happens to be one of two female main characters and the single main character of color for a lame reveal?
Oh
I don't know if you guys call that i'll just play it again because that's not an argument
play what
The video dumb flashback then maybe nothing played for me. Oh, is it playing now?
No, hold on i'm gonna refresh the page, okay
There's no way this is a small change yeah, there's the you cannot call this a small change
You back in
I
Imagining is that working
Mr. Ford
All right
Hello hello
I don't know what happened. Is it is it up for you now?
Um
Uh, it's a apartment and it is
That arthur was imagining their interactions the nice girl didn't actually like him cute dumb flashback
Then maybe he kills her who knows it's an incredibly dumb moment because joker trades an interesting character
Two female main characters and the single main character of color for a lame
Oh
That's the reaction I was expecting
Yes, that's that's his problem with it. It's all it always comes down to so like
He describes what happens in the film is dumb and then he proceeds to say that it's bad because she's one of the two
Main female characters and the only character of color who's a main character
So like just
Extending his logic out if you are a person of color and female you should not be a hallucination
I'm gonna keep that in mind for a future reference. I just try not to be enough of someone's hallucinations
What a weird thing to say, but okay
One of two female main characters and the single main character of color for a lame reveal
It is both not worth it and not particularly effective. Yeah, so i'm gonna walk you through how yeah because
Having her be his girlfriend and being killed off and that's what fuels his jokers and that's not cliche as fuck already
Honestly i'd be surprised if a lot of the audience members were if say for example this relationship was real
Like her dying would almost seem like well, you gotta do that
She's gonna get killed I guess because you know, what else are you gonna do?
Yeah, it's it's one of those like crowd pleasing things with movies
Like well, we gotta have like the male protagonist like die
Well, he's got to have something to fight for like go crazy over and it's gotta be a chick dying or his kid dying
It's like it's the same shit. It's uh, like it's like taken but with joker
Yeah
Joking
Joking
He's coming for all their lives and they thought he was just joking
Oh my god, I want to see a photoshop of liam neeson with clown makeup now
Yes
Make it happen everyone
um
Yeah, also I just wanted to point out we just got uh
I don't know like
You had the misogynist take from bob and now you've got like don't kill people of color
Like why do the the identity politics bleed right in randomly as well? Like that felt like it came out of nowhere
Now it's not not don't kill her like don't hallucinate her
It's rude hallucinate no kill her in real life that's what we want
Yes, we soldier on
Someone uh just
Separated the joa from the quin and jockeen's name for joking
Would actually work it's really good. I like that
So i'm gonna walk you through how making sophie not a hallucination would address quite a few of joker's issues
And give you an idea of what this alternate version of joker would look like
You have to start with the meat cute first thing
We need to slightly change the first encounter between sophie and arthur
Since they are actually going to be dating there needs to be to demonstrate his value to sophie
Show her that he can be a good guy give her dude
You're changing his character now
Apparently jay just had to google it and it exists already. What does?
Liam neeson is the joker
Here we go that doesn't surprise me to be honest with you
I want to see this now
It's not really good. But I mean the fact that it already exists is
All right
What's with like?
Good on you. Oh, it's done with like paint. I guess. Okay
Yeah, what was the context for who made this?
They like liam neeson and the joker
I guess so it's very strange
So
Reason to like him besides just holding an elevator and I think this one's easy
Arthur can use his clown talents to I know he would say that stupid
He can use his clown talents to woo the woman
So, uh, do you remember
Do you remember how uh, she does the the shot to the head and makes a sound then outside the elevator he goes hey
Like, you know and she looks at him and then he does the same thing and she's just like, okay
so like
He's not great with people
Um, he doesn't even understand why that would be interpreted as like a creepier thing to do
He thought he was just sending back what she sent to him, you know, it's perfectly fine
The idea that we turn him into a person who could feasibly successfully
Have a female be like wow, you're awesome. It's like kind of changes his position
Um
But okay, let's see what else he's got
If he's kid he's good with kids. He does seem to be a genuinely good clown
So arthur makes the kid smile and brimming with confidence arthur asks sophie out to dinner
She accepts first date arthur takes sophie to a comedy club, but in this version he is not performing
They are just there to see a comedian gulman a comedian
I love and have been following since the last comic standing days his hbo special the great depression is so funny
End of non-plug
So much worse than the one that we actually watched
That felt odd
So the great depression is so funny end of non-plug and it's a good date
Like in real life with the right comedian comedy club can be a great first date
Especially for arthur because this is where he spends a lot of his time people know him and arthur shares you can't
people know him
Arthur's got this whole selection of people that are having good times with in the fucking comedy club, but he hates the world like
We need to disconnect him from all of these things
That's the point it's like these people these people just don't want a movie about the joker
They want to feel good movie where at the end he becomes a good person
Keep it going I guess it's a stream of being a comedian with sophie and she's encouraging
Maybe he can do it someday. Now. There's a balance
Arthur's fired things around him are going poorly, but sophie's giving arthur some hope now second date
I like the idea of sophie going to the open mic with arthur
Maybe he bombs in the beginning, but not quite as badly. It goes
Fine and sophie's supportive. He just needs practice and arthur kind of gets that he's doing
Okay, but then we get the thomas wayne revelation and before arthur confronts his mom
He tells sophie sophie tells him to drop it take it from a single mother. Why would she come with it?
What do you mean take it from a single mother? What is that supposed to mean?
Wait, so he just basically wants like a dark romantic
Tragedy movie that that's what he wants. I didn't sign up to watch that movie. I don't want to watch this
It's a different movie. It's such a fucking champion for women, but it's like she's only used as some kind of
talisman for him
To explore a different type of relationship
I need to find out is joker still in theaters because I kind of want to watch it again just to spite these people
I got like i'll do it like fourth time watching the movie fine. Okay, I guess google doesn't want to work for me right now
Damn you google
I'm gonna go grab some food. I'll be right back. I love how he doesn't even I love how he doesn't even include
Joe like arthur's mental illness and how
Like the girlfriend would deal with that and how she would like respond. It's all about well, it's kind of awkward
Like the way he describes it like like arthur's just kind of awkward and that's it
Like he's like he doesn't it does actually sound like a daca romantic comedy
like
Like you see the trailer. It's like I love you. I love you too like really crappy musicals like
And then he's just like in his job and then it's like you're fired and he's like no and then the date
He's like you're fired
the meme only made you
And then I you know i'm just picturing this super generic film which is not what this was going for
Yes, so if he brings perspective to arthur
He needs to move so a part of the reason why arthur does what he does is because he doesn't have full perspective
He doesn't understand fully what everybody's doing and why they're doing it
All he gets is the results and he's fucking tired of it
and uh
You know, I don't think that he's necessarily wrong for fucking hating all of the results that keep ending up
But you know as the psychiatrist explains, it's not like the whole world is out for him. It's that it sucks for everybody
But it doesn't fucking matter because it's gonna feel personal regardless
Like the idea that we need this fucking goofy ass character to be like, hey man
It's you know what?
Then shut up
Okay
All right
Forward but arthur lies he can't help himself. He tells his mother she ends up in the hospital
And while arthur is in the hospital arthur's video shows up on the murray franklin show and now it's a nitpick
Not unlike my podcast mostly nitpicking. Please subscribe. Oh my god
More oh my 322 episodes. All right
Going strong
What did I miss
Nothing. Nothing. He plugged his podcast anna. Check it out. Okay, check out his podcast the nitpick not on the podcast
What an unattractive name for a podcast
Mostly dick picking like nitpicking. Oh, they have an episode on the boys. Oh, I don't want to see that shit
I want to see that
Please nitpicking please subscribe. This isn't a
Viral video kind of situation. I don't think viral videos were a thing in the early 80s. What makes you think this is a viral video?
Does that matter anyway? It's murray franklin playing a clip on his show
They explained it in the fucking movie. I'm sorry
You guys see this this is really this is really really good
Let's see
Oh
Grace that's so creepy
Nothing nothing misogynist pointless
Joke has had enough of this society man
Hunchback of blood we're dumb
Oh man
I feel for joker at this image too
Poor guy, okay
Uh, yeah, so
I don't like this the way people are framing this it's like it's not like a fucking youtube video
It's the 80s. They don't have it. It's like a person who runs a comedy show
Plays a clip from a stand-up comedian
With a joke that bombed and he's going to use it to burn the guy immediately after to cause
Hilarity with his audience. This is not impossible for the 80s. Nor is it unheard of?
Can we please drop the whole reaction stuff as orderly bow?
I mean like just like see how memes exist now like all well what you would call it back in the day
It's just like a running joke
Pretty much. Yeah, you would see something and then and they would just make reference like where's the beef?
Shit from the 80s people
Parody that or repeat that because it's it's popular. It's famous. It doesn't have to be on fucking youtube for that to happen
No
But all right, I want to die I want to die what I ever wanted
Ladies I don't even kind of understand how that happens at all
Let's have sophie have submitted the tape from the open mic. Maybe
Why why is that more believable?
The fuck why would she submit a tape where he didn't get a good reaction?
It just sounds like she wants to humiliate it
Honey why didn't you give my tape to the guy like on tv?
Because I love you joker
So she's just as delusional as him then
Maybe I don't know if that's where he's going with this is she because he's she's supposed to be the counter, right?
Okay
some sort of
Contest for aspiring stand-up comedians where if you send their video in and they do well
Murray will have them on the show. She sees arthur's set and she's like, oh, maybe this is good enough
So he established the people were enjoying it that much. It's like maybe this is good
Oh my god
Why wouldn't she wait until he delivers one that makes everyone laugh like what the fuck
Actually, it makes it even funnier
It makes it even funnier when you picture him
Like she sends in the tape and it like they make fun of him and says she kill he kills her because
That's the move
You fucking humiliated me
He doesn't even try to kill murray he just goes straight there like why the fuck would you do it
He goes on murray's show murray's like why did that bitch of a girlfriend send that video in he's like, I don't know
Oh my god
Oh my god
What is this I don't know it's a rewrite accept it it's a rewrite
Oh my god, I hope he never becomes a writer ever I hope he hones his craft
Like some people some people just shouldn't do the things you want to do
Okay, sometimes you're just not good at it and you need to accept it. I'm sorry. Yep, he can aspire to be better
I just don't it's tough to be better than the joke. Okay. Well, here's the thing you can aspire all you want
But sometimes you just don't get the things you want
Yeah
On the show. She sees arthur's set and she's like, oh, maybe this is good enough
So she secretly sends this tape to murray frank such a fucking bitch
Points at him everything that's wrong with society is your fault
No
Okay
nominally worse
It was good. It seems like a nice thing and it just seems more plausible. But arthur seems more more plausible
No less plausible
Less plausible more funny
This man is gonna make me tea from laughter
Nice thing and it just seems more plausible
But arthur sees his video on the show and he's made a fool of so he blames sophie and they can get in a fight
Wait, wait, what happened they got into a fight. I want please tell me that she kills this one
You know how much people would say that this movie was misogynist they oh, yeah
She was just trying to help him and he killed her it's like
Like we came up with a joke ending it might be that he's going with it. I don't know
So he blames sophie and they can get in a fight and she leaves and then arthur goes and confronts thomas wayne
He's spinning out of control thomas tells arthur that his mom was crazy. This makes arthur feel even worse
Also, let's have some people recognize arthur on the street from the murray franklin show and make fun of him
Show that there are some consequences to him being on tv
But then arthur gets a call from the murray franklin show and learns that murray wants to have him on
Okay, this is just the film now. So is is is that it? That's his edit
Maybe maybe there's more to this, but I just the idea that he needed a girlfriend
Okay, let's see if he changes it to the girls this is huge what an opportunity
This will be the first kiss between arthur and sophie sophie and arthur worked together
I've clearly missed something. Hang on
On two days
Let's go back. Let's go back
But then arthur gets a call from the murray franklin show and learns that someone in the chat said, how about another joke sophie?
Fun this is huge what an opportunity this will be the first kiss between arthur and sophie sophie and arthur worked together on new
Oh, so they have a fight she leaves he gets a call saying he's going on the show and they get back together and kiss
Wait, wait, so
So he did he leave out the entire part of him murdering people on the subway for harassing a woman?
I don't know. The problem is when you do a rewrite you need to tell us what you've kept
I don't know what he's kept. I don't he's dropped. Apparently
I'm guessing everything else stays the same but then if it does
I'm getting lost. Mr.
Mr. Nando tunity this will be the first kiss between arthur and sophie sophie and arthur worked together on new material
It's good. I don't believe for a second that she would stay with him if he flipped out on it after
They just had a date for the first time. You know what I mean? That's a fucking as red flags go
I mean especially considering our nutty as he is like he would
Flip out a little you know, he'd be a little dinette. His flip out would be a little more dynamic than the usual person
Because then you also have to think she's not only thinking about herself she's thinking about her child
She's like do I want this crazy person around my child?
It's gonna flip out over something. No, apparently this version of sophie is an absolute retard
She's she's a plot device
In this one and you could be like well, she's a plot device the other one
I'd be like no
She's like a full-on character in the other one that has nothing to do with arthur and she's freaked out by him
The the attempt at almost converting her into a plot device for him is thwarted because it's not real
Like, you know, I think it's much more meaningful than
She's there to tell him everything is good and then she wait, let's see. Let's see what else he does
I'm curious. What else is gonna happen to this film? No, she's back in it
Arthur and sophie sophie and arthur work together on new material. It's good stuff arthur's happy
But then arthur finds the picture with thomas wayne on it. So arthur continues to investigate his hold on
Well, I I have something completely else to say about uh
sophie so
He said that she sends in the tape thinking it's good to murray franklin
Which is what causes the outburst in the first place now. She's gonna work with arthur
I mean clearly if she thought that the first tape was good. She doesn't have a good gauge of what good comedy is
Neither does he? So why in the world? Why in the world would they work together?
So she's fucking him over even more
This is such a stupid
I don't like this vision
Learn that she was committed to the asylum
But he blames thomas wayne wayne must have institutionalized arthur's mother to keep the secret and arthur becomes even more obsessed with thomas
You know, I wonder if there's gonna be like a chris stuckman situation with this where he'll like cry over this tell that
snap neck
Do you guys know the context for that I feel like anna probably is at least okay good
Fucking sorry, what do you know about chris stuckman's rewrite for batman is super bad
No, oh
Oh tell her tell her well, I mean, I don't know it word for word. I just know the payoff part
Which is uh, I I haven't really seen much. I saw the reaction to the end of the video
I haven't seen the actual video. We should do an efel. We read a script out
You'll love fringy. Yes
because fringy fucking loves this meme, but
uh, so the idea is like I think that he's written a seed where they like
Try to chastise each other batman superman for not being like moral enough or whatever and it goes something along the lines of this
like, um
But superman says like the batman is is a hypocrite
He's like trying to get justice through horrible means and then like batman's response is like tell that to zod snapped deck
No
He did that and uh
He was proud of it first. He was proud of it at first and then when everyone hated it
He was like, oh fuck. I just tried to bury it
Yeah, I remember he oh god he posted the video
Like like he posted like he was yeah, he was so proud of it. He posted a video of him like reciting the lines
And oh god
His flat voice just reciting that bullshit is hilarious
And there's a line in the video
um
Where he says something to the effect of and I wrote this in only 20 minutes pretending that it was so much
Pretending that it was so much better than what we actually got
Stop talking. You're not helping yourself. Yeah
Yeah
Oh, it was great. Um
Finding that out. He's also he has this video that he's I think he's gotten rid of now
But you can still find it on youtube just look for chris stuckman redlet media response or something like that
Oh, oh, yeah where he's like, yeah, I saw that
Yeah, redlet media just said like where because they have that new review series
It's one of their first ones I think and they're like, oh look we're sitting in a chair and we've got a red background
We're like those pricks
And then rich evans is like which pricks he's like, you know the pricks with the red background
They just show like three icons one of them is like almond skeptic
I think it's darby john's obvious skeptic and chris stuckman
And it's a fucking joke just you you have a red background. That's all he said and like he's got this video where he's like
I can't believe they did this
Oh my god, he said he said he said he said he said I I immediately removed them from my call from my uh
heroes page or some shit with heroes
And then he says like he says quickly after that like I wasn't mad or anything
But it was an impulse decision. That means you were fucking mad you jackass
Um is christ. I wasn't I wasn't mad though
Genuinely if I was called a prick by rich evans on a redlet media video, I would feel like i've ascended
It would be amazing
Yeah, the funny thing is is that people in the comments of that video were like saying exactly that
It's that they would feel proud of the fact that they were
Insulted by him. It's just wonderful. The idea rich evans calls you a prick
But he took it like really personally
Uh, anyway, he said he he said he dm'd him and said are are we good?
It's funny because like fucking that's how being wolf met like it's pretty much that like, okay
I'd read into my facebook
Sorry, anyway nando carry on secret and arthur becomes even more obsessed with thomas
He writes jokes about killing thomas and arthur extrapolates that out and blames society for everything that happened to his mother and him
Then arthur goes to wayne manor. He acts weird around bruce and alfred and arthur comes home
And we get this big confrontation between sophie and arthur arthur walks into the apartment
He's so out of order. Also, what's he confronting about? Is it his jokes? Yeah, because didn't they just get back together?
Yeah
Okay, but so he
He already had the guy go confront thomas wayne, but it's like the scene that he's showing with bruce wayne happened before
So he's just like re-editing the movie and adding and shit and getting things all jumble fucked up like really dude, really?
Oh
You're taking something great and making it into shit
Hey, man, he thinks it's better. Okay, it's fine
And we get this big confrontation between sophie and arthur arthur walks into the apartment find sophie holding the joke book
What the hell is this? Where'd you find that?
She's holding a joke
What the fuck is this? It's like it's a joke book
Okay
Where'd you find that it's like it's on the table, but okay. All right. Sorry. I'll take this seriously
What's gonna happen to the apartment find sophie holding the joke book? What the hell's this? Where'd you find that?
Oh, I had an idea. I wanted to write down
But what does thomas wayne get when he crosses a society full of people he treats like trash?
He gets what he deserves. That's not knock knock. What it's the police mrs
Wait, your husband thomas was killed by a drunk
Thomas wayne he just writes a bunch of blatant murder jokes
Okay
Okay
Took everything from my thing. It's nice. How all these people
Really don't like this movie
You you're trying to rewrite it and remove the subtlety from the film
But you're telling the film that it's stupid
Okay
And that fucking dialogue he took everything from my family like this is not a fucking
What does that remind you of a certain tv show only me and you will get this because rags is currently away
But that moment where he goes tell me tell me about you hate the bat symbol who took everything from me
Oh shit
Yes, you're on par with batwoman now
Congression
Um
Yeah, for reference anybody go watch
Efap react to episode six of batwoman. That's what we're talking about
It's fucking hilarious the whole episode all of it
Nando
May have been inspired by batwoman. I don't know
thomas wayne took everything from my family and you have a chance to start over to be something
In this vision everything runs the same with the files right so I guess joke is angry the
thomas
Um
fired her still is that
What does he think something what does he mean but took everything I agree with you
Exactly
Okay
Everything from my family and you have a chance to start over to be something and you're gonna throw it all away
I will never be anything
What is so bad about he was like knock knock motha wayne your husband's dead lol
I just feel like dude, dude. He's all that funny. Honestly, i'm being completely
I don't know but it's weird
And you're gonna throw it all away
I will never be anything because of him blame thomas wayne blame society blame the rats blame me
You don't understand what it's like to be abandoned to be on your own get so much self. Oh my god
This is such garbage
I don't think this guy's ever read a book. I got a spic
Throw all of this who's like, okay
This is what we're dealing with super melodramatic conversation between two characters that barely know each other by the way
uh
As evidenced by the fact that she's about to do a diatribe about how she's
Downtrodden from society, I guess but it's not society's fault because that's that was his point. I think
Be a band by the way, this doesn't happen in king of comedy or taxi driver
There's no scene where a character says your fundamental beliefs are incorrect. Travis Bickle or uh, Rupert Pupkin. That's not
You get a character your characters get angry angry at them, but you get that with thomas wayne and um, murray, so I don't
It's kind of what I mean by those references bugging me, but okay
Endant to be on your own get so much self pity, but it's just an excuse for you to do whatever you want
You're so selfish. Um, also there's still has been one fucking mention of his mental illness
Having a character calling him selfish at this moment
Um, all right
I guess
This is sludge
A little bit so pity but it's just an excuse for you to do whatever you want
So give him fish and then so he leaves
Joker never examines this point of view arthur definitely
What is the point of a character challenge him if he's not going to consider the point of view? What the fuck's the point of it?
Is it the audience are we supposed to go oh look a character disagrees with murder like okay
I mean jeez man like
Just take out the mental illness and give him a girlfriend. Fuck it
Fuck it. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if he still has that. This is the thing
He didn't mention that part. So I'm guessing it's the same
And make it shit that's what this guy wants
Is
Joker never examines this point of view arthur definitely has problems. He's alone
He's broke has some sort of serious neurological general mental health issues, but I mean we don't know
And just live simply
Your world building sucks play
Yeah, they never talk about his financial situation at all. He's not even worried about money when he does his job
I know the mom is like writing that she wants money
But that's because she wants to live in a nicer neighborhood in a nicer apartment
Arthur seems completely content where he lives, you know, he doesn't he doesn't seem like he's interested in material objects
It seemed to me that he hated the idea of getting bailed out by the waynes that he wanted to do it himself
Which by the way when people say like he's a deplorable character
I was like, I don't know he seemed to be providing for his mother which was something of a virtue to a degree
But okay
Oak has some sort of serious neurological general mental health issues that the girlfriend is the mental problem
Jay said what he's describing is what i'd expect the director of the hagova movies to write for a joker movie. Oh
Jay is supposed to like him you're supposed to be the nice man
But I mean black single mother in the 80s in the era of the welfare queen that's not easy
Sophie is truly marginalized the kind of person that society really leaves behind
But sophie has a child to take care. Why are you saying this? Like it applies more to her than joker at this point
Like she is left behind he you know
She's
She's
She's the real joker. She's the real
It sounds like he's trying to develop her into a character that has been just as
dislodged by society
As he has but she's dealing with it in a better way and he's going to become the joker
She's the counterpoint. You don't have to be a joker everyone. It's like
Okay, this is what I mean. I'm waiting for him to tell me what this achieves
Hopefully he does that care of so she can't just pity herself jokers about a lot of things mental illness society
Guns like if joker's about anything it's a movie about a desperate jackass
Wait
Did he even mention guns in this rewrite of his?
Let's let's see talking about the the the actual movie at this point
No, he's talking about the movie, but they don't fucking prioritize. It has a gun in it. They don't talk about guns
I want to hear that
The kind of person that society really leaves behind but sophie has a child to take care of so she can't just pity herself
Joker's about a lot of things mental illness society
Guns like if joker's about what does he what does he mean? It's about guns
There's guns in it
does he just try to make a comment on gun control or uh
The the that's probably what he's reading into the lethality of guns. I don't think that many of us, you know
Thought that guns were placid items, but okay
About anything it's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer
It's too much to talk about now
But look up the trigger pulls the finger it gives joker a new meaning that I don't hear discussed nearly enough
But at its core
I need to give that again. You kind of lost me there. Yeah
Guns like if joker's about anything it's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer
It's too much to talk. Whoa
All right, so the gun is for self-defense he
Loses his job. Thanks to having it and he does actually use it in self-defense
He doesn't become a psychopathic murderer the second that he's provided the gun. There are other things going like wow, that's a reed I guess
I like his first like real
fucked up kill that might have been
That it was like like unjust was the one he stabbed that dude in the neck with a screwdriver
Right the guy the guy he hunted down on the staircase most would argue was pretty fucking harsh
uh
At least in that point
There's like at least a little bit of justification because all three of them are beating the shit out of him
And he's just in a rage at that point. So
Is it excessive? Yes, is it
Completely unjustified. I don't think so not completely this um
You do get tried differently and under law when you're in like, um, you're seeing red or you're a fit of rage, right versus
A cold calculated murder, I believe especially if you were attacked by the person
Did you ever watch the movie a time to kill?
Uh, no, I don't think so
Oh, it's so good
It's with uh, matthew mcconaughey sander bullock samuel jackson and kevin spacey and like keathers other one and donald's other one
Came out in 1994. So basically it takes place in the south and
samuel jackson's eight-year-old daughter gets raped by these, you know, basically
white supremacists rednecks and so
They know that the guys are going to get off because they're in a really racist
part of the south and so samuel jackson goes to matthew mcconaughey who's a lawyer and he's like
Are they going to get off and samuel jackson's like?
Yeah, they're they're gonna get off
They're gonna maybe go to prison for like a few months and then they're gonna get out
And so samuel jackson goes and shoots them like when they're on their way to court because you know
They raped his eight-year-old daughter
So he murders them in front of all these people he goes to jail
And matthew mcconaughey is defending him and his plead is that he's pleading insanity
That samuel jackson murdered these guys because of what they did to his daughter and it drove him to be insane
And that's the whole thing that they're trying to prove is that he was
Temporarily insane because of that situation. And so the case is them trying to say no, he's not insane
He did it. It was premeditated forces him being insane
It's really good. Maybe you should watch it. Yeah, you know and i'll pop it on the ever growing list. Um,
So like yeah just coming back to the whole um
I think he's just trying to describe some form of a trope
I guess he's trying to say the the uh, the joke replies to it. Like let's just play this fully so you hear
Everything joker's about anything. It's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer
It's too much to talk about now
But look up the trigger pulls the finger gives joker new meaning that I don't hear discussed nearly enough
Gives joker new meaning that I don't know
Yeah, it's because no one else is stupid enough to make this point not even
I don't think anyone would agree. The joke is that simple. It's like no, it's not just it's not just a film
But a guy who gets a gun becomes a killer. That's ridiculous
mauler mauler guns have electrical signals that go into your brain and make you kill people
There's no other explanation
Yeah, that's why I own guns and you know, I have yet to kill people but you know
That's a thing that these sjw think well, I guess he's saying that I don't even entirely know he said that like
It gives the gives the film new meaning or like if he said if the joker is about anything
It's and it's like I don't like it when they do that
I don't like it at all. It's like that's not what it is. But also pikachu one of our regular artists made this
Oh boy, let's see
Yes, yeah
You
Can we can enjoy this for a little bit before we go back to the pain
Pikachu's the resident cute drawing person
Do you have purple hair?
Oh yet now I do
I say that we've got a couple of cute drawing people actually
um, but yeah, anyway
Also, yes, I guess we should acknowledge rags has uh
Been gone for a little bit. He said he'd be back
All right
Yeah, just just one last time hear him say it again
Just to really make sure it's when he's saying it's a movie about a desperate load. Sorry. I gotta go further back
All right
He has a child to take care of so she can't just pity herself jokers about a lot of things mental illness society
Guns like if joker's about anything
It's a movie about a desperate loner who is given a gun and immediately becomes a violent murderer
It's too much to talk about now
But look up the trigger pulls the finger gives joker a new meaning that I don't hear discussed nearly enough
But at a trigger pulls the finger
I didn't quite catch that was on the trigger pulls the finger. All right
He said look up trigger pulls the finger or we can't talk about that right now because you're just too deep for you pleb bitches
What the fuck are you talking about?
Ridiculous. Okay, literally making the guns kill people not people kill people argument
I'm not even gonna say what what it is. He say he doesn't spend seconds on it
So I guess it's not the name alone. The trigger pulls the finger implies quite right, right? Yeah
Rip bookie 2988 did he off himself?
That's a meme as far as I know. Oh just to say that he's dead regularly. I don't know
Oh
So it's like the the brett keen thing. I think so. Like if anyone says a boogie has died don't trust it until
Well, I don't know. I don't know what would make me trust it until it shows up on twitter, I guess I guess. Yeah
Apparently enough but at its core joker is about a man who cannot move forward because he believes he is a victim
Taxi driver because he is he is a victim. What the fuck?
But okay carry on king of comedy worked where joker didn't because they were able to take their
protagonist to task
Call him on his contradiction because both characters are contradictions
Travis pickle hates the ugliness in new york city, but he also participates in it
Rupert wants to be famous without doing any of the work. He's determined yet entitled
He does do the work at the end. He comes up with a comedy skit skit. There's actually like not too bad
I remember um, I watched this film with um metal and he was like, oh is this gonna turn out to be really bad?
Like the when he finally gets on stage and like his jokes aren't too bad. They're like you you're like, oh
These are okay. And it's part of the point of the film. I think that
He what do we think about the results that um, because he does go to jail
Because he kidnaps somebody to get the position he wanted
But then he gains fans while he's in jail and then when he's finally out he gets his own show just because of
The fame and so there's something to think about there
I suppose what the show's trying to say a lot of people try and argue that um, both the endings of taxi driver and
King of comedy are in the character's heads
but as far as i'm aware, uh
martin scorsese and and um
I think one of the producers or writers or something of taxi driver said that the ending is very much real
It's not in his head
And um, I think something similar goes the same for king of comedy. I'm not gonna say that for sure though
I need to check on it, but
the the idea that
You know because king of comedy comes out with like a book on like his yeah people argue that that's all in his head
I don't think so
I think that was a message that
I don't know
I feel like based on the story that was trying to be told was that even when he goes up and he says
In front of everyone on stage and he's like I had to do this you forced me to be this radical
Because you wouldn't listen to me. You wouldn't give me the time of day
so I had to force my hand and that's why i'm here and you guys are all you know laughing at my jokes
And you guys are all going to be like even horror struck and laughing after you find out that everything i'm telling you is true
And I thought that was kind of a poetic justice for when he goes to prison
He writes his book and he becomes even more famous because of what he did
Sure. I thought that was
You know, I that's what I got from the movie
Um, and this is the thing like he's just concluded now
By the way nando has practically said that his rewrite is just better than the movie and it's like
If you say so but um the specific element he's looking for is a character that challenges these people
But like again, I don't even believe that actually happens in taxi driver and it kind of does in king of comedy
But it has no effect on the character
And like it only happens in the same vein that you have somebody fucking shouting at him which these things happen in um joker
So
I just don't I don't agree with him. I don't follow through and I really feel like you know
I'm cynical at this point the people referencing taxi driver working in comedy
I'm just like are you just doing this because this is the thing to do
Like as a video essayist, this is what you're supposed to do to sort of uh,
Flex your credentials if you will
Like I know my films stretch out your lame ass videos
I gotta get gotta get it gotta get those mid-rolls. I gotta get those mid-rolls
He's the same kind of guy. I'll get a little more clumsily
He wants to be popular in loved like rupert as evidenced by the fantasy, but he doesn't want to do stand-up
Arthur just wants attention
But he doesn't actually want it because when arthur gets the opportunity the chance to be on national tv
He doesn't see it as an opportunity. He sees it as a problem
Yeah, marisa jerk to arthur but arthur is still a want to be stand-up comedian who is about to go on a national talk show
arthur and the movie
Never consider the fact that this could be a huge win for arthur arthur immediately decides that this is a bad thing
His life is over and yeah arthur i think his life was already over before he got that call. Wasn't it like
Everything was already falling apart
um
And he saw the the murray show as just perfect for a platform for him to kill himself on
Like uh, the um, it all comes back to that line right the uh, I hope my death makes more sense than my life
Yeah
But all right
Did murder those guys on the train but the police don't seem to have that much on him arthur kid either
Wait jay wants me to skip back a bit
Jay, what do you want?
He's the only said is no that's not skipping back
Why don't you skip back a bit jay? Yeah, jay
I have an hour left on the show. I'm we're what of how many minutes we have left
You're probably probably close to the end you think because he said that the end is going to involve a big personal message
So as soon as he gets to that we'll probably stop because you know
It's not analysis anymore. It's more like whatever's going on with him and his channel, which is fine
Why is it?
chinese spam, what the hell
Yeah, I don't know what in the world is going on
um
Okay, give me one sec
Maybe you have friends in china
Nah, we definitely don't no
He said travis pickle really
Jay, do you know how far back we have to go for that also?
Um wolf, do you want to be a mod so that you can you can hit the chinese people while i'm doing everything else?
Um
Sure, just say something in chat. So i'll just fucking mod you then. Oh so much chinese spam. I don't have to say
Freaking kong freaking kong
Okay
Do
Jay find the timestamp you can do it yourself. I'm sure of it. Did you say something?
Okay, there we go
I did the thing there you are
Oh, all right
Wow, you just command me to make you a mod that is fucked up, dude
There you go. Now you can kill chinese people
Like you give me a lot of power dude
I mean if they show up again, you'll be fine chat. It's all right. You're all right. It's fine. It's all right chat
I got you. Apparently him saying travis pickle is way too far back. I like that. He would have fucked up both
Protagonists for both those movies though. That sounds funny
All right. Let's go on over India. Arthur did murder those guys on the train
But the police don't seem to have that much on him. Arthur could either just ignore the police and hope he doesn't get convicted
Or he could explain a situation claim self-defense, which it's kind of true except for that third guy
But hey, maybe just say that you were fighting with him or something. Listen
I'm not suggesting that arthur should lie or anything like that to the police, but he does have options
This doesn't need to be the end of his life. We need a character. Okay
So so he's like saying oh arthur you shouldn't feel like it's all over just because you can cover up these murders
Like I think it goes deeper than that, dude
It's it's not just the fact that you've killed people
Actually, would you?
Can't you just like block flute musician? Oh, well, you can just ban him, right?
Oh, I don't know. So it looks like uh, jenna and despo shit made, uh, deleted his shit and
Oh, there's a timeout or something. Yeah, if they're here, they'll kill him too. No worries. I'm sorry china. You're not welcome here
Okay
Yeah, uh, there's more to
I don't know. I'm trying to argue that he's like hey
Joker shouldn't feel like killing himself at that point in the movie. I just be like, oh
Okay
I love the idea by the way
But let's just say nando is a friend of his in the movie. He's like dude, it's not all over
You could you can just say that those murders were an accident
like
Like i'm dealing with all of that, dude
Come on bro. Go to this gun control rally with me. You know, you can really learn something
Guns are by it the trigger pole the figure
Oh my god, whatever you do don't fall asleep
You're saying that there's a movie of way luke skywalker runs around killing children
Oh
Oh, it's wonderful
We need a character to give arthur that perspective present him with a choice
Use his appearance to get revenge on someone who wronged him in the past or ignore that
And use the appearance to get a better future
Arthur chooses the past and that sends him down a self-destructive path that ends with him murdering a talk show host and
Maybe inciting a riot. Although it's
Now he's doing a bad path. He's changed way too much for this to work the same way
How are you supposed to improve his fucking image if he killed people
Oh, I'm fucking serious
But now he's going on the wrong path when he decides to go on talk show after he's already murdered
I like the whole I just tell the right jokes. I can salvage my image, man
Um, I like how much he's desperate to try and create this choice at the end of the movie
Wait, and you saw what he was like?
Oh, there's multiple accounts for hiding on the channel. We're not idiot. Yeah. Oh gosh. Look the flute musicians coming in
Don't worry chat. The the mods are doing everything they can i'm sure of it
Um, oh, I imagine some extra people are probably getting pooped by accident as well
I'm sorry, hong kong, but yeah, I was just gonna say that he's like desperately could drive a choice at the end of the film
when um
I'm assuming the point of the film was that he was on like a one-way track thanks to all of these
Outside elements like it would have turned even the most normal people and saying but he also had to have a fucking mental illness
on top of everything else
Um
Joker singing to himself. Um, should I choose the smoothest course steady as the being drawn?
Should I blow this motherfucker's head off?
Hey, man, it's a 50 50 choice. Okay
Oh, you're coming flute position again. Oh my gosh
Is flute position aware that we can't read any of that
There's like spam must happen now, I mean
It'd be funny if you converted and it's like i'm currently streaming at stream.com slash
DWX ZZ come watch and it's like an actual guy
Playing like fortnite
Well if he's playing fortnite then he's pretty much a dead man
Mm-hmm
I rounded a loop. Did fortnite come back after they had that blackout?
I assume so
I don't know though. I don't think any of us play it
We play great games like call of duty, isn't that right wolf?
Hey call of duty
Well guys get comfy with flute musician, okay
Okay
Looks like he wants to keep on coming at this this chat
Um, the only I mean, I don't want to turn chat off, but he's obviously using different ip's and accounts every time so
Just cozy on up
with the chinaman
A part of that arthur actually played seems like the riots were gonna happen with or without him
But there was an alternative an alternative that sophie was perfectly positioned to present
An alternative that would call joker out that would take a stand against his self-pity
And the self-pity taxi driver and king of comedy and now joker used to justify their actions
Unfortunately, every single character in joker was either mean to arthur or lying to him
There was no one to present this alternative and in everyone was mean or lying to him
Anyone want to challenge that statement
Does he not remember the midget does does anyone does anyone ever remember the midget never forgets the midget
I remember gary
Okay
Uh
Yeah, see like his his thing is he wants it to be a girl
It has to be a girl has to be romantic
Generic romantic story. Otherwise, he just can't his little mind can't compute the story
Apparently the spam is an opinion on the film
In chinese
Um
I'm guessing this is the translation. I interpret the ending of
I interpret the ending of the clown as the end of its beginning. No one cares or understands
Me
The cloud is now happy at the pain and finds it interesting what
I'll paste that to you guys because apparently that's what it is
The ending of the club
So flute retard is just too dumb to not spam his opinion. Maybe it's a bad translation. I don't know
I hope that's not a bad translation. Oh, this is another translation
I explained the end of the cloud for the end of its beginning from scratch. No one cares or understands
I am happy about the pain now and I find it interesting
I don't know what to make of that. Good luck i'm trying to
I'm happy about the pain now
Oh
Anyway
Instead of using sophie to present the opposing viewpoint and introduce gray area into an otherwise black and white story
Joker wastes sophie on a surface level fight club style twist that was honestly pretty transparent from the beginning what?
Wait, what did he say? He killed her?
Is that what he said? No, he's saying the joke. No, no, he said the film wasted her
He's talking about the actual film now and that she was wasted as a fight club like reveal that was pretty obvious from the beginning
Well, there you go
um
So my my position and I said this to my friend that I watched it with I was like I was willing to begin
Complaining about their relationship. I was like there's no way that
I'm supposed to believe they're in this much of a committed relationship when I've had barely any scenes of them connecting
So I was like so either she's not real or this is badly written and then when they reveal it I was like, oh, okay
All right. I was assuming bad writing just because of the dceu track record at that point
I I knew it immediately because like no woman's gonna fucking come near your door to your greasy ass door and be like
Like yo, my god, you're such a good dad. Like what the fuck? No
No, no, no, especially the way race relations were
Like in the 80s and shit
Like a black woman's just not gonna go to some greasy white dudes door and be like I want to fuck the shit out of you
No, it's not gonna have not not back then at least
I like how so the whole reason I ever would have guessed that is just because we just don't think it's realistic what they were
They were portraying
That's why we guessed it as opposed to it being like I knew there was a twist coming
Yeah, it's not like I like it's not some smarmy shit for me. It's like oh, it was so it was so predictable now
It's like
You know, it's in his head, you know, but it didn't it didn't take me out of the movie
At all. No, no, I think um, I don't think it damages the movie at all that I uh had an inkling that that was the case
I'm fine with that. Um
It seems like a lot of people who don't like the film will often reference the flashback bit and the reveal and like
The heavy focus on that for me. I'm just like I guess the film's doing pretty well then
If that's like your big issue
I like we got anything else. It's like it doesn't mean anything like all right
I mean this guy's argument is that the film didn't challenge Joker enough. And yeah, that was a little bit scary
But all right twist that was honestly pretty transparent from the beginning
Oh and one more thing
If you've been watching videos on this channel for a while, you're probably familiar with this video sponsor
Curiosities no fucking blink
Blink please
Fucking blink. I think that's it. Right? Because yes, because because he said he's gonna talk about something personal now, right?
This is curious deal. It's just two ninety nine a month or nineteen ninety nine for a year
Okay, and if you can believe me
a bottle of cyanide
When you subscribe
Stream.com slash Nando and a NDO you
Subscription to something called nebula. Oh no, there's another thing
Nebula is a new subscription streaming service created by
Independent creators some of which you definitely already know like went over productions or I don't know who's wed over is but okay
I do cgp gray cgp gray or kutzkazart or patrick williams
I want to know
No, come full circle
We got it
Inception
Dab it williams
Or me here's how it works first
All of my new videos are uploaded to nebula. Wait. Sorry. Hang on. I need to what was this
Subtitle me one small change can make a big difference. This was not a small change good, man
Change the whole fucking movie
Here's how it works first
All of my new videos are uploaded to nebula ad free
but second we're able to work on other stuff like
For instance, there's a collaborative project that's ongoing called working titles
Where a bunch of us creators have gotten together and we've each picked the television show with a title sequence that we find
Interesting and then in the videos we talk about why that title sequence is cool. For instance polyphonic did
This sounds so lame. What the hell is this?
You guys teamed up I like everyone's saying ad block now
Um
They teamed up to talk about why title sequences are neat, uh specific ones, okay
On game of thrones patrick williams did an episode on the 90s x-men animated series
Just right did an episode on the batman. Oh, no, just just writes that too. It's the it's the fucking video essay team
They're like they're like retarded avenges
animated series
And i'll also be producing a video for this series where I talk about
One of my favorite television shows of the last 10 years that also happens to have one of the most exciting title sequences
In the history of television here's a clue about which show i'm talking about
I know what it is
I don't know why I started that one basically nebula is a sandbox where creators are free to
Still going experiment
We can make cool new videos and serieses that don't have to cater to youtube three minutes left
You know, where's the like with the five seconds then skip well, what happened?
I missed that stuff like that. And right now if you go to curiosity stream.com slash nando don't do it guys
Guys run. I don't want to
I don't want to hear this guy
run off like
fucking
Sponsorships by now because I don't like sponsorship is because it's him like I don't want to fucking look at you
While leering this shit, you're not you're not tempting me. No stream
You will also get access to nebula for as long as you're subscribed to curiosity stream
And on top of that if you go to that link and you sign up you get 30 days for free
It is a win win win win
What am I gonna have to pay? Is that a win?
Bayouin said that this nebula thing with all these creators is like payf
Yeah, that would be payf
Pay for symbol
So nebula is one of the things that's really important to me
Here's the other one if you're watching this video before november 2nd 2019
On november 2nd 2019. I will be participating in an extra life charity stream. If you're not familiar with extra life
It's a can I hear you?
I think this is the pistol thing that he said so
All right, that's it
Wow
We did it two joker takes that's another two down we've got like 17 it's fine. We don't want to do it anymore
Sexual harassment, uh, so yeah, what did you what do you guys think which one was the worst video?
It's always always always okay
well
I don't know because i've been playing a video game for this entire second video to like numb the pain
So I might this one might be as bad and i'm just not cognizant of it, but movie bob hurt more
Yes, I agree movie bob hurt more
Um, I think this guy got more like fucked up about joker though
I don't know what to say
They're one of them or even like criticisms because they don't even provide anything this guy was just like let me
Show you how I can fuck up this. Let me take something. That's great
and
And then movie bob was like, let me tell you why joker sucks and then not provide anything step back up any of his points
Um from what I started dying I started dying laughing at this guy's
His faces they were fucking hilarious
That was a blast like with movie bob. It's just like you just sit back and listen and just call him a fat bastard
Annihilating
Oh man late
I don't know. It's just uh
There's a lot of you know, we can check out more as time goes on in terms of joker is bad takes
But these aren't very good
Uh, but a lot of people really didn't like joker. It was quite surprising and I don't know if it's partly to do with
The fact that it's really successful
So it's like I gotta say something about this because i'm a i'm a film connoisseur
I know what film is about like I think that is if the film flopped and nobody actually talked about it
Movie bob wouldn't have made a second video
You might not even made a first one
I wonder what would have changed like what we can change in movie bob's life if we were to go into the past
like find
Baby movie bob like what do we change to prevent him from like, what do we change to prevent him from ever making?
There's a ball of dough and we're like
We poke it
Oh shit
He's got those same shades on oh absolutely yeah, um
Yeah, I mean i've got uh, so how much time has everybody got?
Uh, i'm assuming if you've got like 20 minutes at most is kind of what i'm making for i'm just collecting some memes and then
I will allow you guys to leave yeah
I gotta open in the morning. So
Don't have much time. Unfortunately. Oh, yeah, I got 20 minutes sweet
I love how the frags doesn't come back. It's just gonna i'm just gonna read super chats alone
Like yay
But it's okay. I'll so oh my goodness some of these memes
No, you'll you'll have froggled by that point. I guess I could drag him. I'd also drag jay on if he wants to be dragged
You know my stream should only be about two and a half hours
So if you're still reading super chats, which i'm assuming you are i'll come back
Well the last time we only capped out the timer at 12 hours. I don't know what you're talking about like
It'll be fine
The fact is i'm still collecting memes
How long have we been going for five and a half hours? I knew this was gonna happen
Have you guys noticed that some of these streams go kind of long?
No, no, did you notice that longman are bad
Yes, everyone knows that you got told that in primary school
Oh, I guess you guys know everyone knows wait, what do you guys call primary school grade school?
Elementary school. Oh that yeah. Well, I think isn't primary school like across like every single year of school or
I don't know how it works and you're terrible like communist country. Yeah
Yeah, what what to you is primary school, uh, so he is
Well, this is the thing this isn't gonna make sense because you guys have grades not years
Well, it's the same thing essentially. I don't think it is
Explain well that wouldn't even help anyway if I said it goes from year one to year six
You guys would be like, I don't know if that's grade one to grade six. I don't know if that's how that works
Okay, well how long is a year?
For you in school like the ones complete year
Yes
Okay, so that your very first year of school, you know
You go when you're like five or six that to us is kindergarten and we got first grade second grade third grade
So on and so forth kindergarten is age four over here. I think four and five
I think I mean I started kindergarten when I was four
But I think that they might have raised it or they have some kind of weird cutoff based on your birthday
But yeah, you go to kindergarten then
So for that is that year one for you, uh kindergarten and then you go to year one. Oh, sorry
I guess you could it goes kindergarten reception year one two three four five six
But I don't know if that's entirely standardized across britain or if that was the school I was going to
Okay, so how old are you when you were in reception?
That would have been I get see from what I remember that might have been age four actually in the year before that is three
And the year after that would be five preschool
So you went to preschool then you went to I guess the second year of preschool then you went to kindergarten
That was year one for you
Right wait just dude what's yours he goes you guys go before high school is
What middle middle school?
There's elementary school middle school and then high school and then college
Oh, yeah, so what do you call your years in high school how many years are you in high school?
So if yours goes elementary then middle then high hours goes
Uh primary
And then there is no middle school and the rest is comprehensive school
High school for you guys is comprehensive school for us
How old are you when you go to comprehensive school? I can't actually remember exactly the age. Honestly
The problem as well is I consume so much american media that I fucking forgotten a lot about
Like what what years and what things happened?
I'm picturing four-year-old baller walking into class with his gas mask on
Okay, how many years is comprehension school is it just that goes from year seven to
Year 11 and then two years of sixth form I believe
Sixth form is like you get you can you don't have to continue but it's like it's like super high school years
And then you go over to university slash college
Is it better to go to sixth form or just go to university?
Most people try to sixth form is like bonus education, I guess, but you don't have to I think that's the end of mandatory education
I'm really not the person to be asking this by the way. I've probably got this
Well, you keep asking questions i'm willing to drop it
I'm trying to understand this. Yeah, i'm not the person that's going to be able to help you with that
Okay, I don't remember this why does your stupid country do everything so overly complicated you guys took our stuff and changed it
We did it first. We made it better. We took something and improved upon it. Your sounds more complicated. There's more things
No, it's very very simple
Well, it's just it's just preschool kindergarten
first grade
Great second grade third grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth grade seventh
And eighth grade and then high school four years of high school and I said
No, no middle school is
Well, well it depends on what middle school you go to because i've seen a couple that like, uh
It'll go from like grades
Well, some elementary schools go up to grade six and then it's just seven and eight for middle school
That's not the one I went to
No, I went to one where it was six seventh and eighth and then you go to high school
That was mine
Yeah, that was that that was mine too. I thought that's what I said
I don't know. I'm dashed from those fucking videos
No, you're gonna say brains brains have melted to a degree here guys. You gotta
Yeah, I don't remember the we listened to nonsense for how many hours now?
um
Too many four five probably five there was a lot of discussion in between so maybe four. Um
Yeah, i'm collecting memes i'm doing it
gosh
People with their memes. Oh my god
I got someone tweeted me. Uh, you cannot be serious. These are so cheap. They have ikea lamps
Uh, they use ikea lamps in the bat cave on batwoman. Oh
What?
Wait a minute. Wait, i'll show you i'll show you
Hold on. Let me let me screen cap this shit
This is so funny
Best soundtrack ever
Oh
Fabulous
I miss our our chinese guest who is sharing his opinions about movies
I wait you good for the screen cap
Oh, what the hell is this god this fucking shit tons of bulb memes. I can't imagine why
Did we cover this
the song
Um, I was watching two videos. Yeah, I know we're pretty fast today, aren't we?
You might even say disappointing
But I mean this is how it goes, okay, let me have a look at this
That that's amazing
Oh my god, you're right
I mean, let's just I don't know bruce bolt with ikea. What could you say?
It's just like it's just like he's got a way manner discount
Do you think it's like when alice's thugs wore gucci shoes complaining about how they're fucking broke?
Get the fuck out of here
They eat out of cans and take away
But then they also like live in a kitchen and then you see them cooking from it in one of the episodes and it's like what?
What are you guys doing?
Yes, while they're while they're wearing six hundred dollar gucci shoes
They're a confusing team priorities everyone
Um the nose tints
Having memes drip in from discord twitter pm's and everywhere trying to collect them all the
daunting task
Say the least feel bad. The rags might miss the memes, but what can you do? You know, what can you do?
Not our fault. He quit Joaquin. Can you do?
That makes sense, um, all right discord has to stay off screen for a moment
Just
There's a play inside your head we're getting a lot more episodes of that, you know
Oh god, like you think it'd be over after the next episode like the next episode feels like a finale like season finale episode
yeah, um
But i'm guessing they'll do some kind of bait
Like alice is dead or defeated or captured and then I don't think they're going to kill her
I feel like that's unlikely but they'll have some kind of like
batman comes back right at the end so you see like the back of him or the joker is
The new joker is around on you, you know, someone's gonna be baited
The guy did say he was riddled the answer at one point, right? So the riddler might show up
Oh god, not saying it's a good thing. Just saying it's a thing. It's gonna
I think the next
Um, what 14 episodes are gonna be the like worse than the first eight I can I i'm calling it now
like because because what it like you ran out of story like it's over like it looks like this
This episode coming up is like it's over. It's done new season. Wow, you underestimate these writers
Or you simply estimate them correctly it's it's tough to know right now
um
I mean look it teases everything like
alice possibly dying alice finally getting her revenge. She's like she's all glammed up at
one of uh, fucking the wife's uh
fucking
Whatever
And she's at least she's finally gonna get this finally gonna be some kind of conclusion
But it seems like it seems like an end of end of season episode does not feel like a mid-season episode
Yeah, no, it'll be it'll be interesting to see what the hell they're gonna try and pull off like this is the end
Oh my god, okay memes collected
How exciting all right
Can't wait
I'm so excited
This is a combination of a new and old meme and timbert the ending of the clown as the end of its beginning conflucious
It's fucking flucious
What is wrong with this forehead
There's gonna be some the i'll probably repeatedly show just the we pointed out already, but check that one out as well
Oh
You got so many fucking drawings you might have to click that one but uh
So many renditions of bob he's even got a fucking uh nast controller belt
Oh guys not opening no
Uh, let me see if I can open it on my phone
Yeah, well let me load it damn well if you guys put on the stream you can see it
Oh, it's gonna slow down I suppose. Oh just pull it up look and then put it back down. They'll be fine
It's not loading look at the stream it's up there
All right, hold on. Let me get get there. Just
Bullshit it's had to be tismy discord
Come on, okay, yeah and diabetes we trust
Just wait, where'd you read that in the chat? Oh
Yes
It's floating sugar, I mean I just I like the drawing a lot it's very good. Um
Just another like I said, we got a lot of bob memes. Um, hopefully most of these will just show up in the just going
I feel like someone just put his head on some kind of hideous creature. Just like yep. That's a meme
I don't even uh
That's from the star wars animated series I think why can't you just be normal has no things
That is the babadook
I know these references at least some of them. All right, this one's a little terrifying but still loving
Bob in the room
Is that like a really early picture of bob or is that somebody else
I'm assuming though. I've seen like several memes with that face. So I
I don't know if that's just a popular fat fatman face to use or what?
Yeah admiral holdo like he tries to fuck the doll and she keeps giving him vague instructions on how to fuck her
He's got the candy floating
Yeah, as people chat say it is young bob
Uh young bob was
really ugly
Spam dude got a meme made out of it
The ending of the club has ended my great suffering it has
Oh man
Congratulations
Chinaman you you became meme status by accident. The way of the cloud is just as I for no one understood the fusitians
He speaks people really jumped on that that wasn't too long ago that we figured out that was what it was
Wasn't it like only like 30 minutes, maybe
Joking
Oh, it's perfect they've taken his beds he will have them he'll find them but he will have the last laugh
I don't know. I'd watch it. Just saying I would too
I think we all know this meme very well
I
See a podcast I see you on efap and a lot of bad joker takes jesus. That's a lot of bad
Um, I like how jenna just said wolf has me googling popular fat man face
Oh, hey, we got a plot summary for this one
Joking Joaquin is a real joker one day
He jokes to the wrong person darth uchi pushed away from his ability to joke by uchi
He will learn to reclaim his power and make jokes with his goal to make the most offensive joke possible
He joke which will destroy all minorities before uchi can and show him up
Before she can and show him up
He'll destroy all minorities
All right, there's so many fucking diabeto memes that they're like pretty good for the amount of time we've had
Diabeto is like an efap villain, I guess
And see then we have other examples of diabeto that I mean still work
I don't know why that that one he kind of looks like jeffrey donner
Um, if you put out a few hundred pounds
Yeah, but I mean the glasses the stash thing the dark diet
Is that is that bat woman's head
I think apparently i'm just keeping watch of them while having my cup of tea
You're a snake
So, uh speaking of diabeto versions, holy shit
Oh
That's a good one
You got some long arms and some itty bitty little wigs a theory on metatextral water farting. Oh, no
that bulge is
magnificent
It's quite the creature
I wonder if he knows that a load of fat art was drawn of him today
He'd be like, why do I why am I wearing magnetos clothes, what's all the chocolate what's happening?
Bob v. Jenny dawn of joker tisms there is so much pointless shit in joker
What's that other one say there's nothing in joker. Well, one of the things she said was it was too overt, right?
You could probably have the clash of that. But yes, they would clash
special
So this is a an image combined with the tweet we read out
It looks so natural
I could believe that was actually in the film
Hunch bob of diabetes
The efap fusions
It's just standard sort of video game chats involved rah would be the the god in this I suppose
Um standing on a roof naturally
This one uh
Yeah, you linked I didn't get it on screen
It's like
What what what's happening exactly?
I can't tell if that's a little bob coming out of his face
I don't i'm a little confused to be perfectly honest
What the fuck
I don't know exactly what's happening. It's all so terrifying. Yes
Um, maybe you're supposed to be how he got his dimple
I i'm very frightened and frankly confused, but okay. Mm-hmm. I'll go with it
So like when people first meet him he's quite terrifying I think that's fair
Nobody's really prepared for the movie bob
I guess this one's just a very quick observation. I think it's nice and fair and it'll remind you of simpler times when we were talking
just
several hours ago
hi, Annie
Um
Take it easy with those twizzles. Oh my god the barrio hat one
I guess he wanted to like cosplay barrio because there's a lot of those photos
All right
Bob why do you like this? I don't think we want him to stop
Oh
Roll of the movie
Look at the droid
Back there
Oh, man
As hail but as sold by morgan freeman
A newt's in the adventure
I'm not you know what there's a lot to interpret with this image
Oh
Movie bob wishes he was that thin he's downright athletic at that point looking good bob
Oh
She likes being scrappy dude
Um, look at that i'm little so I like that is I guess this isn't really a meme I got thrown in. Um
This was on
I don't think it was in I think I just caught from discord. Uh, if you like a movie
Wait, sorry go look at molar on youtube tlj's the worst thing ever happened to the franchise
I like the move of a god damn subject with the wist written stalls movie ever
They've quoted and said if you like a movie, it's good. That's how it works
Okay molar the guy spent
12 hours on a live stream mocking jenny nicholson after she made a joker film review
Tell me why I should take someone like that seriously. You don't have to
I don't care if you take me seriously
Watch out moles the kind of guy to name search himself so he can quote tweet tweets that make him the maddest
Okay, who could have guessed that a guy who makes a five-hour review of a 2.5 hour movie would have so much free time on
his hands
Then this is my job review and stuff at this point full-time, but I mean, all right
Uh
Yeah, uh, I mean it's the same exact take so
Does this guy think he's the first person to say oh they box jenny nicholson for 12 hours?
I mean, maybe it's more accurate with movie bob especially with this next one
I like that it's spinning into circle. He's like set up the hula hoop of sugar
Once again magnificent bulge
Why didn't you draw him drawing him with a fucking bolt? How do you know that that's his is not just fat?
Or could be a donut hole we don't know what it is
So this is the character from doctor who I was talking about
It's like a flap of skid, but but he's deflated. This is kind of what he would be
Oh my god
Diabeto deflato
I'm sure he's still fine
I don't know what to make of this one
It's terrifying in its own way why does he keep making these
Wait is like a specific guy? Yeah, I know who it is
Um
You guys like this one so it's bigger. Oh, yeah, you still got detective
When even batwoman can't crack the case there's one man that got them
And he turns
All right, hold on this lots of detail in this I gotta I know the beams are like absolutely good sometimes like guys
Oh, he's on his rascal scooter
Little basket I think he's looking at like evidence
Oh
Not nearly as fat as he is in real life though
Well, you know it is his movie maybe use some digitally defatting sort of stuff. Oh, yeah
digital defatation
Like how they have de-aging it's defatation
Diabeto
Oh, no, he's got the d is made out of half a dota and a popsicle
I don't know when you say the d I just think of something completely different. Oh, he's talking about the actual
I think not sure what this is originally but
Damn titties though. Yeah, you know you got four of them man double decker titties
And now for something completely different
Pikachu made a animated rags
I will have to save this one for when rags returns
But um, oh it's adorable. Oh, I guess
Catastropica, I don't know if that's the same person as pikachu. Actually, I might be wrong
I'm assuming it is though
Digital d slimming actually exists by the way according to chat digital slimming actually exists
I can believe well, I don't I don't know
He looks so happy though detective I have hawkers on the case
Hmm all he needs is his hat he's complete. I think these were the from the orc references
Oh
I love the idea of an orc becomes a movie review
Seriously so much so much passion in these these uh diabeto
You will be defeated by me diabeto
I think he's floating all the fat people in the background
You made it work mostly
Into his video, so it's all good. Oh my god the bobbinator
Chip latigan
Oh, I can't see it come on discord work, that's great
That green screen one has just been put in for these images
Oh
This is bob
Picture him driving down the stairs
I like how it's not even the beer hat. They've just sellotape the fucking cats
The can do spirit right there
This is what a feminist looks like oh my god
Oh
My god
He's on the case guys, right?
Hey, we'll stop right there
This cuter is uh surprisingly fast
Silence log bad you would certainly get me
Uh back when rag's discussing which one he'd like to bone
Oh, yes, see he is black with red stuff in it not red with black stuff in it. All right
It's one of those infinite sort of questions that faces man
Is this presenting him as like the villain
I
Oh, I know this reference it's from wolverine origins, I think I think oh, yeah
It's the blob you just call me bob
You get upset because you call it bob
It's movie bob
Why do they've got normal humans as labels
He's anything but
The uh, a 3d artist technically, um
Detective diabeto ham hock on the case guy wrote with blood movie bob did it
What is he even writing there looks like it's a sled with a stick or something
I like that. He's got the colors for magnito though. It looks like a sleigh but with like cheese curds for
Maybe the the person who died was his like the person who pulled it the just dealer is cheese
It's cheese dealer
The rarest of cheeses
It's another perfect neck blend
I wonder if that hurts his neck. I think so
Go
Come on gooby-doo bop one meets the uninsulled
Uninsulin diabeto
Oh, yeah, I could see a team up
Oh another fantastic quote from movie bob I assume this has nothing to do with this actual stream outside of the fact that it's
Movie bob but there's no such thing as a bad tactic only bad targets
I
Kind of makes you you know, thank goodness. He has it doesn't make any sense
Are you telling me there's no such thing as a bad tactic only bad targets?
Well, what if targeting one person over targeting 50 people is the choice?
That would be a bad target and a bad tactic
I respond to that with a drug
I
Can hear this picture
I'm gonna have to go but I will come back when my stream is over because i'm assuming you're still gonna be reading super chat
I think it's almost a guarantee
It is oh my god
If I don't see if he has one leg in that picture
Uh, it was nice. It was nice meeting you jay wolf. It was nice streaming with you
It was nice talking with you. Um, do you wanna?
Meeting you as well
Do you want to just plug your uh, your channel and I guess your your stream as it's about to happen
Um for the people in chat
So guys, uh, i'm gonna be doing my weekly show called the jack show it rotates between channels, uh me john maylon
Cecil and kelsey and this week it's my week and i'm already two minutes late for it
so
Yeah, so kind of late to my own party right now
But uh, my my channel is called that star wars girl. I talk about star wars surprise
And uh superheroes and other like stuff in pop culture. So yeah, that's what I do. That's what I talk about. Uh, yeah
I don't think I have anything else to say but uh, oh I do art videos too. So there there's a surprise thing
There you go. You gotta hook them in with something. She's got crazy good art too. So buy it. Oh, thank you
Thank you
Well, uh, I will be back
Uh, i'm all I'm assuming you will be here. It's a guarantee so
I will talk to you later and uh to you others
Uh, hi. Yeah, thanks for having on. See you later
All right, I just noticed that their diabeto has a big leg. Yeah, I was just trying to point out well that picture it's funny
Got his leg chopped off from diabetes
They still got they got they got the cads attached to him as well so he could
You know what that reminds me of is like the people on my 600 pound life who have like legs that are rotting off
Because they're like way too big for them
If you've ever wanted to like have really good motivation to not get overweight just watch clips of that on youtube
It's really good motivator to work out actually
Yeah
I feel like these memes have been pretty good motivations
But
Finally finished the script for episode nine mr. Mouse
You can't just recycle an older styles movie again. Do it over. It just looks at harry potter the goblet of fire. I don't even
I I don't understand what the reference. Yeah, I think I might be
Maybe the joke is like he just can't do anything original has to fall off something you'll rip off
Thanks, yeah, I could see it jj has no limits
This is what feminist looks like. Yeah, such an embarrassing photo
That's a movie bob still I think
That face does kind of match up because he's got like the dimples aren't as pronounced
But they're still there like I could believe this is him 10 years ago, you know
He might actually be not as fat now because those are those are some tycanic cities. Yeah
Um, I also kind of want to point out like it says the following picture includes major spoilers for hell
That's a really good
Oh, oh man
I can't remember if we looked at this one or not. Yeah, but this you know, you have all kinds of different
things that
It sounds more like a commander that oh, so do you like that they photoshopped the belly like they've just expanded it out. Oh
Thank god
Still hope he's not that collar looks tight after yourself there bother
Some pixel up bob looking good confident. Oh my god
So this is the x2 seed I guess too much sugar in your blood
He's like tearing the skin off
Yeah
Again, I mean, you know these movie ideas you should pursue them
This is the I was hacked alien from ages ago, but I guess with a ball of skin on it
I just I like it. It's cool
That's what happens when people think
This is this meme that that's what the aliens look like and so if i'm an alien
This is what I would look like. I just be like i'm not an alien
He gets talking about
It's good stuff. Hello it. Uh
Oh, this is a mandalorian meme I got this stupid rock thing for you. Geo geo
They're all eating the geo
Jesus get somebody kicked jay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what rags would want at that point. I think
Um
Oh, I think this makes a lot of sense
On episode nine rolls around
There's only one thing that'll happen
Fucking everyone will have courage on it. Um
You know, it would be a better meme if it was that meme
the uh the black um
the uh
The black the ball the black guys on the white chick the orgy meme. All right
Oh
Maybe it could be applicable
Rage
Oh my wolf this is about you I guess
I fear no man. Oh what I can't read all but that thing it scares me
Uh
When I was trying to get obi obi s to fucking behave it's like confuse screaming confuse screaming
Oh, these are so good
Logic facts just a good old-fashioned meme at that point
Oh
Oh
What's this one
Hey, so remember when we were watching that just right video and it got all the tism
Well, I must have raged out because I woke up and my channel was gone
Then mauler was like it's been three months. Come on. We're covering jenny nickels in the
This is okay
Absolutely a summary of accuracy to the events 100
I don't know. This one was just sent to me. So I don't know if you got it, but yeah, I love it
Movie blob in this natural environment
Oh fuck there we go
Hang on
There you go
I feel like he would he would feel powerful in there
That's this it's natural environment sort of thing um again so many visions of diabeto
This is great
He's stronger than you'd think
Don't yeah, don't underestimate diabeto guys. All right, I see you in chat. They're thinking about it
This is um, oh
The blob
Wait that is the blob, right? Oh, I think so. Yeah. Um, oh, okay
Spider's predictively bob he's come oh no
Spider why didn't the spiders tell us? I think the spiders wanted this to happen
They don't usually tell us when it's stuff. They want us to experience
spiders have betrayed us
Uh, maybe it was for our for our best interest when you that you can't stop me detective ham hark
My blood sugar levels is beyond your understanding
He's got his little his little crab
Oh boy, he's like wearing a diaper I think
Oh
I think this is the uh, the translation of the chinese lettering
I explained the end of the clown
For the end of its beginning from scratch. No one cares or understands clown
I am happy about the pain now
And I and found it interesting
I shall the ending of the clown is explained as the end of its beginning from the beginning
No one care understanding the clown is now happy with the pain
And found that it's interesting. I explained the ending of the clown is starting. I think it's repeating. I'm not sure but
I think you get the gist. Yeah
Nailed it
Um, oh
Well, here's a here's one that just came in it's
Pretty relevant right now
Dog oh give me a sec
Color orange breeze rag is description lost rags last seen on e5 61 if found please return to maula
What?
He'll be back I am actually curious at this point would have pulled what pulled him out for fucking what is this four hours now
three hours
I hope you're okay rags. I mean it's he missed the entire second video
Did he yeah, yeah
Maybe he's dead
Maybe that's just your opinion
All right, now we got just a couple of older memes and then
We'll be moving right along. This is uh, obviously
the new template we're going for with efap because
We're a very leftist podcast as according to knobs. I hope you guys like it
I like that. They didn't even bother to just like magic tool out the magic one tool out the white around it
That's so fucking disturbing
Jeb Jeb bigs
No
Oh, yeah, right it has been like just about two and a half hours god, I I ironically hated
It's not about the themes about good stories and characters
everything
Yeah, shitty video
Please
This one's like a whole story. All right, we got
Now our podcast small, but there's a lot of potential for aggressive expansion
So which one of you gentlemen would like to team join our little team?
Oh, and there's only one spot for our newly open spot right now. So oh it's between
Fringy and jay apparently
Even chat has got a gun on them
Um
We're gonna have tryouts
Oh and his robot head make it long
Because they say make it quick. I love it
memes ahoy
Oh shit, we got a description of the plot for star wars episode nine to age of
och och g
The the universe is in anarchy after c3po says the n-word before finn can grant him a pass
Yes
The shockwave of the power released spawns a new foe named ochi
uh
Being so powerful. He can say any slur he wants whenever he wants to whoever he wants it will take the team
uh team up of a black person lando and a jew kylo and a woman to stop this new threat before he can become the
ceo of racism
I love that a woman is just really nebulous. They don't even
specify which one
Just anyone will just one of them will do
So one of jab's new movies old jab on the massive front
Artificial gut of shooting. Oh wow jenny's in this one. So it's quinton one of them big get together movies
Um
I guess this is me as as as linkin or tommy lee jones
uh
Abraham lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery
I i'm not 100 on that one. I yeah, I don't
I don't know
Man of balls
Almost
That that actually
Kind of looks almost convincing. Yeah, like I could believe it until I look closer
I want to see this this it'll probably be more entertaining than the actual man of steel movie. Oh
Oh, hey looks one of the deleted screenshots that have come out about the new star wars. That's pretty cool
Yeah, we're fast
You know like this one detroit the cub jab
It's just his face
Oh
Yeah, I guess c3po deciphers the dagger and it says ray is a mary sue even got an er reference in there
Oh offensive
I call this like three different versions of the last jab. Well, this is last jedi
Okay
It looks
It looks flawless
Like the jeb I is completely it looks great and then jeb's face
Looks perfectly photoshopped in there. They even got the red on there in the blue with the lightsabers
I could I could see this I could see
His name was jeb skywalker all along. It wasn't luke
Oh
Mark hamill was wrong. It wasn't jake. It wasn't jake. It was jab
Uh, let's bring this down a bit
We got this from the new rick and morty episode or the first one I don't care about the timeline like creators of terminator dark fate
Find themes find joker theme
Jenny video retarded obsession
Jenny twitter drama jenny
twatter followers
He found his sex is toxic red pill retarded don't watch 12 hours. Jeb egg
It grows in her brain. Beams are born. Oh my goodness
Well
It's an interesting interpretation of events
but uh
Relatively accurate
Well, that's a terrifying also by wolf I guess god
Some fucking incels did an 11 hour video about kyla watching ray shitting. They're raging misogynists
It is true this was done oh god, we lost another one
Um
Well, i'm just gonna keep going
In a gentle way you can shake the world mahatma gandhi, please clap jeb debates are gay no bullshit. Yeah
Debates are gay
Yeah, I actually saw that part of the stream. Oh, did you?
Yeah, I didn't see the whole one. I I stopped in on that. Well, no, you know
No, I think it was done and I were wound to that part
And I had to stop because I had to do something else
But I thought like you said debate and he has like the douchey voice you expect him to have yeah
Debates are gay
Bro, dude, bro debates are gay, dude
Debates are gay that's like it's a good quote
It's like a shitty harry potter name harry potter and the quiz
Like what?
Can't say it sounds that interesting but maybe
Oh, hey, uh, so this is a reference to the new batwoman episode the italian chef you'll have it the big gay get the fuck out
Oh, it's a nice little drawing of ra on his rooftop
Looks like he's sailing on it. You're working joe looking massive. We'll learn to fear my fucking rooftop. It makes sense
Um in law, he's a person who throws people off roofs. Don't worry about it
It's relatively complex to keep track
So rags accidentally called angry joe angry jew once
You got angry jew if this is the dynamic hispanic told of jebsteth
Apparently this is like a real ass post where they just put jab on it
I don't know what the hell happened
Is
Because the last one he that was his thing right he wrote his slogan or whatever just said jab. Yeah
Jeb
Jeb is a nefap fan. Oh, absolutely
I see a chick in the background laughing at him
Oh
Yeah, hang on
Jeb supports us even in his rallies
Good old jeb
Jeb brought wolfback praise
Um
But yeah, I was the spiders for seeing exactly what was going to happen with the jen
Jeb nickel stream and you know what, you know, they didn't stop it from happening. That's just how it works
Oh, yeah, we became big fans of darth uchi toward the end
and so this is
Get well uchi. We love uchi
McMuffins
What's the what's the story behind the McMuffins? I don't know. I don't know the lore. So in the film there's a lot of
MacGuffins and uh
Das bullshit when trying to read out some stuff mention one of them and then he said another another fucking
McMuffin
Uh, I guess he was hungry rags you drunk. Oh, yeah three beers three is enough for rags
Adorable little doggo gets super drunk super fast
Oh
Wait, did we show this one already? I can't remember but I find it hilarious
Rags is clearly a right-wing racist. It's like no, he's obviously a gay leftist
retard
So many movies we have to go see according to these beams look at this McMuffin
Right staring at a goddamn
Hey, these are top quality beams, okay
She went to the mick muffin planet the jabs they have cub despite a predict soul
Um
I think you might have shown that one already. No, the other one had a movie bob
I think it's a template. Oh, okay. Oh, I got you
Movies don't need logic consistency me online. I
I can't what does that do for bend 10 the watch does it does anyone know?
You you tap the watch and become whatever monster you selected so they're turning into you
I
Wish I didn't know that that's a really bad show that I thought was good when I was a kid. Oh
This is just a photo of obviously
A school where they teach efap probably and they put in jab the bush
Someone actually did this
I like this one's got twitch.tv slash. What is that?
thorda breakey thordmas
um
I don't know but
Follow slash tune in I can't even read what the link is but okay
This is fucking great I love this
This is taking my
That's priceless oh my god look at my friends don't worry not you
Literally forgot your names
Not not you niggas, of course
Oh, wow check this out one of them horror movies I hear so much about
He doesn't look please no he's unhappy yeah, not the not the greatest living situation for him
See and that's you know, you have that direct comparison where he's much happier here
I thought that was the name of the movie till I looked down
Oh
It looks almost good enough to be convincing
Like what a very nice terminator
So this is gonna confuse the shit out of jay longbone. It'll be great
Oh boy, the long men were created by tonal gloke after the final battle between the cosmic chicken and goliath
The long men are fascinating creatures their height can go up to 15 feet
The longest long men grew to be 20 feet tall most long men live to be 50 million years old
The oldest long men live to 1.2 billion years old
The long men do not need to eat sleep or drink. They live off objectivity long discussions and critiques
They have incredible speed it is said they can run around the entire world in five seconds
It is objectively impossible to record their exact speed the long men have extreme elasticity
They can stretch their arms to great lengths, which would make them very dangerous as an opponent
As an opponent the first sighting was from an explorer by the name patrick williams of in 4000 b.c
During his quest to find the mystical plot hole williams wrote in a letter
I saw this creature that looked like a giant skull on wheels
He later writes that it was too quick for him to get a better look
Bigidius added in his teachings that the long man must hide his face because eye contact can turn a man into atoms
There is no further information on this creature because they were said to have been wiped out by quen
Quintinius the immortal during the great tism of 2050 b.c
There was only one survivor this document must never be discovered by quintinius. I have hidden my identity for my safety
No
I was translated by scooby dubious
This is another one from the 3d drawings just log bad bad i'm like
cycling around through portals on this
Molten island i'm assuming this is twitter
Like how I don't know how else you would depict twitter to be honest with you
But um, if you click this or it should just play it. That's like a video version
And I like that it just has epstein. Epstein didn't kill himself in the background
Oh, it's beautiful
And yeah, uh that does it for the memes
um
I know there's gonna be more
But uh, they're all the ones that I've collected and I know
I know there's probably a lot of people out there right now. Like what about my name?
It's like I swear to god trying to and get them all collected up. I do. Um
I think there's there's two more i've got in my little backlog there
Give me a sec. I will grab those
Oop
All right, that should do it
Okay
um
Also, I should say
Since apparently some people were mad about what I said about ben 10. I haven't watched it in
Keith Wilson
since the
Whatever. I I stopped watching when they were like teenagers and it looked dumb to me
So whenever that was all I remember is that I
Well, actually no, I barely remembered the show other than like Cthulhu's like the main villain or something
Space Cthulhu
I just remember the show being silly. I don't have any objective reasoning behind it
I just assumed like bad retrospect, but whatever if it's good
I don't I don't remember. I haven't watched it in forever. So there we go. I didn't realize they're ben 10 fans
I love how i'm just like, uh, like a dark like peanut with with purple hair
I mean at least you're riding rags. Not bad
Right in rags, yeah, I like movie bob there as well looking fine
Um
And then we've got uh
so the vision where um
Everything is slightly different
got
I
How do you draw this in such a short amount of time, this is awesome, I don't know I don't know how do you do that either
It's horrible
Oh my god, someone please someone please make one of him shaking the shit out of her
You say why did you fuck me up really bad?
Why did you do this to me?
I just like the idea that he's like, this is a great change. It's like everybody would hate her. She ruined everything
Um
Space Cthulhu. This is why I hate wolf
I only remember there being a person who had like tentacles on their face or something again
This is again pulling from what's probably like
10 years ago memory wolf you can't remember specifically what it was the fuck
I don't remember what even the well, I know the main character's name. I don't remember anyone else's name
There was like an old dude, I think
See this is why I hate wolf
Doesn't even remember character names
What a piece of shit
What do you have to say for yourself wolf?
I don't know. I I didn't realize that there was a large following of bent 10. I
I haven't thought of it since I was a kid
well, um
I was actually gonna say i'm gonna move on over into reading super chats now. Um
I don't want to
Keep anyone longer than they were
Having to with with with all of the video coverage and the memes and I know
Some people are running out of time. So would anyone like to eject at this very moment?
Yeah, I think i'm gonna have to I got a lot of stuff
To prepare to leave town Saturday
But you must plug your channel
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, I guess I should do that
Yeah, yeah jay long bone. Uh, I make uh movie reviews and trailer reactions
Funny edits and such right now i'm doing i'm
Fucking reacting to batwoman. I'm just kind of what?
Thankfully they're on hiatus so I can do other shit now and I can react to other shit
So but yeah right now i'm just that's the thing that's the batwoman that bullshit i'm doing that so
expect more of that
in december
But yeah, that's my channel
Well, there you go. I was gonna say it should be pretty easy to
To hit subscribe there in terms of just check out the um
The reactions to batwoman because you i'm assuming you guys in chat i've actually watched the efap once you'll have an easy in there
It's fun getting multiple perspectives on such terrible content
Yes
At least you won't be alone
Yeah, it's not really my perspective and they're really that much different
like it's
Just a little easier on one episode than you that's about it
And I still I still think it like when you said about it, like I completely agree
I'm just like for me. I wasn't reacting to it. Like I should like I should have when I was watching it
So I was like fucking I mean review it. I don't think anyone's gonna deny it
We were discussing it was like one of the worst episodes are still the fucking elevator one where he's like
his whole plan is to
Capture people in elevators in the hopes that batman will attack him on the rooftops that he can kill him with a batman killing
Gun it's the most like what the fuck is happening
So retarded
But still excellent tv and yeah, you can check out our coverage of it. It's all we're seven episodes with
And uh, yeah, we'll um, we still got an efap movies to record with you in the future. So expect fun. Oh, yes
Most definitely. Yeah. Thanks for coming on. Appreciate it. I hope you've been entertained by movie bob and nando
Oh, yeah. Yes immensely, you know, thanks for having me on you guys are great
Oh, yeah, um, I just hope you had fun instead of dying. That's all
Yeah, thank god for that second video that actually got brought me back i was getting ready to kill something
I like the little a little asterisk at the end like oh, yeah, we'll screw too
Well, yeah, i am i'm gonna go bye yeah
Bye
Would you say wait
No, oh, okay for a second after you're like no don't go it's okay
Also, how come I posted the thing and then it said message retracted on
The thing who can retract my messages in my chat who has the authority to do such things?
Maybe it counts as spam or something. I don't know. But yes, uh link is in the description as well. But wolf would you like to?
exit as well
Yes, I have to work in the morning. Would you like to can't stay oh you're you're
For some reason i'm retarded. I didn't put your channel in the description, but
Um, you can still plug it
Go right ahead. I will link it
I make a channel the things that you shouldn't watch. I
Working on a review of jedi fallen order
Although i'm playing it through a second time and then i'll probably play it through a third time before I actually get the review up
Although this time is going a lot faster than the first time. So that might not be as long as I thought
Yeah, i'm doing that and then rise of skywalker and then I quit star wars forever and yeah
Yay
I could have sworn you said in your tlj video that you were never gonna watch star wars movie again
Then you watched solo
And and you watch an episode nine. Well, if you're a you're a dirty liar and hopefully, uh, you'll keep making videos
I have I have like I had like morbid curiosity to see how badly they would destroy everything
But now it's like you have an episode 10 made by ryan johnson when you have morbid curiosity for that
No, no, no, no. No, i'm never giving ryan johnson a penny of my money ever
Not even if you do the thing where you buy a different movie and then go to see it
No, I don't want to give him my time either. No fair enough
Oh, well ryan johnson lost all goodwill
That I didn't have in the first place, but you know
Will I I mean I well
I had neutral will because I didn't know anything about him when I went into the last jedi
The only thing I knew about him is that my friend liked looper and I was like well
That's that's a thing might be good
And then then the last jedi happened and now I hate ryan johnson
So no, no never never doing the thing
Well, I mean at least i'm gonna look forward to
Dragon wait, so what's what's the next thing that's going to get done then because you only got a
Less than a month. I'm really going to try
Yeah, and I gotta i'm gonna be on vacation the week before christmas
so I won't be here for the rise of skywalker stream
and
I hope to get the jedi fallen order review out before I go on vacation because I won't be able to edit it while i'm out
But
Yeah
So hopefully in mid december at the absolute latest, but then again, you never know with me
so
Yeah, well then I shall leave
Goodbye soon. Have a good everything
Yeah, that that probably won't happen. But yeah, have a good some things
God sure
And that leaves me and rags rags, how you doing?
I thought that like you've you've you've been a little bit quiet this uh the stream
Yeah, I know you don't like movie ball, but that doesn't mean
Okay
Oh
fine, um
Rags, you know, he's just he's clearly just having a bad night tonight. So we're gonna have to try and see if we can find
some other avenue in which for me to grab a soul in in for
compornium
also known as company
I mean he sent me a message. Okay, so i'm assuming it's okay
Okay
All right
We got a lot to get through I feel like i'm probably going to be capping out the 12-hour thing again
But hey really we've already made it that far, huh? Has rags gone to sleep?
I feel like he has I mean it's been like what two hours now
I don't know. I hope he's okay. Um
All right
So this is the one that hit on the street. This one I had to skip out on it said mad lib time
Efap give me an ad vib adjective noun adjective noun ad vib
So I remember that I was there. We're gonna make it efap related, right? That's the idea I think
Okay, so we're gonna use tism once but tism applies to all of those
Yeah
Um
Um
If we've got we got how many nouns we'll have massive for one of the nouns, I guess
So wait, what's first? It's the nouns first. Well, we got three nouns. We'll use we'll use up them
So this is going to be taken very seriously. Okay, this is incredibly serious. Okay
You add so a noun is first, right?
Well, yeah, I was gonna say we'll do yeah, there's no two adjectives
So two adjectives two nouns and sorry three nouns two adverbs two adjectives. There we go
Interesting, okay. Okay. All right
so a massive
Is
Wait, maybe maybe i'm retarded on this as well. Let me check what adjective is
A weird adjective is a descriptive word. So like so massive is it totally works
Right. Yeah, because you wouldn't
You know, i'm continuing what an adverb is though now a noun is a person place or thing
Well, this is see this is the thing a noun is like a class of people place or thing and it's like a massive is a class
of person
There's now
We can only use it once. All right, that'll be the rule. So okay. I will use
Um, I say massive is fine in the adjective. All right, fine. We'll have massive in the adjective. What about tism?
Maybe noun tism is um
Well shit
It could be both couldn't it
A tism could be a person, right?
It would be tismy if it was an adverb, right
I I think so his adverb is what what's adverb again?
I'm kind of blanking on that one a word or phrase that modifies or qualifies an adjective. So like got it
They are a tismy massive
Yeah, I think that works. Okay
Also, people are irritated with my avatar
I'm not gonna change it. Sorry. They like the other one because it's from fan art
Yeah
Yeah
That's no excuse. Um
Batsplaining, what would that be? Batsplaining that would probably be an adverb
Wouldn't that be batsplaining?
Um
Maybe maybe batsplaining would be an adjective. No, it wouldn't be an adjective. No
No, it's got to be well batsplaining has got to be just a regular verb
Right. Okay. We don't have any of them. Unfortunately. Okay, no verbs. Okay. What are the nouns of efap?
Um
Jeb is a person. Yeah, that works
Um
Diabeto is definitely gonna be there now diabetes. We've got a diabeto now and he sees strong presence here
Yep, and I guess the dawn
The dawn perfect. Perfect. Uh, what about locations? Do we got any locations here? Well, uh, the way it works is
It goes adverb adverb adjective noun adjective noun adverb
Yeah
So did we just use all of our persons? We've lost all our nouns
We've got one adverb and one adjective left. We just we just went persons the whole way
We went persons whole way. Oh, you're saying like we could have proper names like proper location names. Um
Yeah, because i'm because i'm sitting here wondering like what kind of like, you know, efap memes
Do we have that are in terms of nouns like places?
What locations are in our lore chat
That's what i'm wondering
Yeah, bigidious would be another person. I don't think wales counts as an efap meme
The opinion hold that's true
Oh
Basement apartment, but I don't know if we're getting too weird basement apartment. It's a long story
Okay
Um
Singapore is a man flag is a thing. Yes, singapore. Absolutely. Let's do singapore. All right, singapore diabeto and jeb
They'll be our three nouns
So yeah, I didn't want to go three people so
So another adverb we've got tisme
Trying to think of one of the the philippines would have been one as well
Um
We're probably gonna have to rely on chat for this one because i'm gonna be running blank on everything. I asked my
head to look for
Yeah, a lot of them were really loving the isle of man flag right now in terms of things
Oh, I know. I don't know if isle of man because three words. I don't know if it'll screw up his thing or not
I'm assuming it wouldn't but I don't know. I like singing. Uh, no, it shouldn't because if it's a person plays a thing
It doesn't have to specifically should we swap it to isle of man?
Um
I mean chat seems very keen one of our
Yeah, let's play take one of our persons and replace it with the isle of man flag
Well, then then we'd have you have to lose jab or diabeto and i'm a fan of both of those
um, let's
Let's leave diabeto because he's a newcomer and he kind of needs to make a splash. You know what I mean?
Did you see the memes?
Sure, there was lots of day if you want to pick singapore over diabeto
Um, no, we got um
right now we've got
Diabeto singapore and the isle of man flag, right?
Advib you well, I would i'm just gonna i'm gonna stick with jab diabeto and isle of man
I'm sure it'll work. You'll be fine. That's what really we're not this singapore. Okay
Well, I mean it only keeps our podcast going i'm just saying. I mean we're not even using it right now
Okay, we are shut up
I I think we set that before the stream started by bad. Um
Okay, um
Celestially celestial
Antisomy would it count as an adverb if
So you like a tismy massive a celestial massive it would still be an adverb at that point, right celestial
I think that's adjective at that point
Is
These rules are complicated, okay
Yeah
Oh, yeah, celestial is actually defined as an adjective. All right, we'll just put it in there that works
Okay
Um
Which means we got one adverb left
Mm-hmm
Vigorously
I
Mean what's that got to do with efap?
I don't know. It's the first thing that came to my mind
Oh objectively
Oh
Wow
All right person who sent her that super chat. I think you were southward fawn
um
Our choice is for the nouns a jab diabeto and isle of man
Our two adverbs are tismy and objectively and our two adjectives are massive and celestial
We did it
um
And now i'm going to continue
So first we gotta get all the ones that were missed last time. That is what i'm now going to begin
I'm gonna be here for a long time
Okay
Much like jar jar was in episodes two and three much much less after phantom menace rose will show up much less after tlj
Or she'll be written better. I think I read that one out but still um
Yeah, she's gonna be in the next episode a hell of a lot less, but she was never in the first one
So it's kind of like jar jar kind of not though
um
Rose tico compared to jar jar
Well jar jar is the much superior character. I think we can all agree on that
Yeah, at least people liked jar jar at first, you know
Yeah, nobody ever liked rose that never happened no
Anyone said they did they were probably lying. It's fine
um
I mean i'll admit when I was a kid. I liked jar jar when I was a kid
Fell asleep during stream woke up an hour before alarm exactly at my super chat perfect timing mauler also rags
I'm from the netherlands. So negative alt here
Negative alt here
Huh
Is he talking temperature I can't remember what that might be referencing right
Rags what do you think that's what sucks about carrying them over right? Yeah rags. What's your input?
He's been really passive aggressive today, he just keeps ignoring me
Yeah, he's been in the mood. What's going on rags? Come on, man
You're uh, you're being a mean go. Hold on. What the fuck. Hold up. What the hell is this?
What?
No, somebody's spamming. Hang on a minute
Oh wow, that's like multiple accounts too
Yeah
What is what is youtube's recommended way of getting rid of that outside of I guess I would have to um
Get a specific I could ban specific words, can't I?
I think well, i'm pretty sure I can do that we've been hacked I don't I don't think that would
solve
Anything well, it would just make chat a little lower
Well, it means that they can't actually post anything that connects with so for example if I put streaming live now
As a bandwidth. Um, i'm pretty sure that'll work
Give me a moment chat. Don't panic
Let's have a look
Immunity
Did I accidentally hang on I accidentally did somebody else okay, there you go. Yeah holding all there we go
That's how you really get the job done
All right
Now i've just saved that let's see how long he lasts. Hopefully it stops, but it might not you'll be wrong
Nope, it seems to have stopped right in its goddamn tracks
Bye-bye right in its tracks. Look at that shit
Hey, at least that works. All right, so hey, it looks looks like jenna's still here doing the stuff good shit
careful chat don't ever say
I typed it in wrong. I said dreaming live now
streaming live apparently that worked
But um, yeah, don't say streaming live now or you might get hit with a block or ban or something just
I figure there's no reason anyone would need to say streaming live now
But we shall see I can so what usually happens with this is I can unban that word then or set. Uh
Later at the end. Yeah
We should be fine. And thank you mods for um
looking out for uh
You know the welfare of the chat, I know they get very antsy when there's when the spam
All right
Hi rags, um, he would say hi back for sure
It's always great to watch efap before work and it's even better to see it going strong when I get out of work
Oh, well, yeah, you got an extra one this week, too
Yeah
Um, oh my fucking god, you're still going we're reading this one when we've got like a thousand left
Now you think this is gonna take six hours
I mean
When I we had less last time that I didn't finish and it took us five and a half hours
so
That's where we're at though. If rags isn't isn't here. There's a good chance. We won't like go on as many tangents
There's a good chance
Though if something piques me and you as interest
We still will call on tangents. I just love the idea. We did do a mad ones that uh
Ann has gone to do his stream and by the time like, you know
She leaves when we started to do super chats and she'll be finished and she'll be back. Well, we're not even halfway probably
But it's fine
Uh hashtag rise of skywalker endings on twitter make your own get it trending. I absolutely love you guys
Keep up the great content. I would just type the leaked one and be like, this is my joke ending
just be like wow, it's uh
That's really stupid this would be like yeah, yeah you think
Please efap the ringer binge mode in upcoming last jedi podcast
Mallory ruben says attack of the clones is objectively bad but ranks tlj
Number one star wars film plus we get to listen to women also shalom rags
um
shalom
Attack of the clones is objectively bad, but tlj is number one
Okay
I was I was a little there was like a lot going on in that one. I was a little confused on what to even respond to
well, they want us to check out a podcast where
Mallory ruben says
Attack of the clones is objectively bad, but tlj is number one and
I mean if that's all they say there's not much for us to you know respond to there. Yeah
I disagree with that. All right
I too
at least with the part like the idea of
Because I hear a lot of people say like you think tlj is worse than attack of the clones and there's an argument for those
I suppose but
tlj is pretty bad. Um
Yeah
But number one. Oof. All right
I'm glad
I'm glad that I can sleep eight hours after the start of the stream and efap is still going
Yeah, and that's see that's referring to a different one
Yeah, there was that uh that time when you were with uh aden paladin and oh my god
That was that was amazing
That was we had the whole wasn't the super chat stream, but it was like five hours something like that
It was pretty nuts. Yeah
Hey all I have a bunch of digital holiday art for you guys. Where should I send it? Probably too much for twitter great stream
Uh, is it too much for twitter?
if it is
I'm trying to think of I guess discord
Um, my mod should be able to help you out in terms of getting it to the right place
But i'm curious what it is if it's too big for twitter because twitter can like support a lot of stuff
Um, am I too late? Well, if not y'all fellas hear that trump watched joker if joker is our black panther
Then trump is our obama

He had people at the office watch it or something
So he actually so that wasn't like a meme or anything, huh? That was real trump sat down and watched joker
I think so. Yeah, I don't see why not. I'm sure he watches movies
Yeah, sure. Well say what you will about the guy at least he's got taste. Hmm. Joker's good shit

Mueller I tried to tell you via super chat during dp

He meant to ko the lady holding the baby
God that how did that go for him?
I wasn't trying to tell a jury that it's not as bad as you think I wasn't trying to punch the baby
I was trying to punch the woman holding the baby
Oh
It's like that
It's like that guy the fucking tried to roundhouse kick that one gal kicked her right in the head and like i'm trying to
I tried to kick your phone like um
It's not a hell of a hell of a lot better there idiot
Imagine disney doing this to buffy all in service of some new op slayer destroying the point of the series finale
A reboot would be far preferable
I just say stay away from buffy. But if they're going to touch it, it's going to be terrible. Probably i'm sorry
Uh, we're all far apart and yet we can talk the internet truly is magical imagine what someone from medieval times
Would epstein didn't kill himself
It is pretty amazing, I think I already talked about this but uh, I did um

There's nothing we can't do
Except some stuff
Rags i've decided to use my 2k to buy a gaming pc. But alas, I am not computer smart

I don't know what koreans. I guess i'll save that question both of those for rags
Uh, I can say koreans are really fucking good at video games. There you go
I don't know a heck of a lot of koreans though. So i'm afraid that's all I got

No point feel free to add any others who wins the entitled progressive female award ps. Here's to dune bringing some sci-fi
sanity
Who wins the entitled progressive female award? Um
probably
ray or captain marvel
Yeah, I would have to say
Daenerys
It wasn't exactly a progressive female award. She admitted like hundreds of thousands of people
Yeah
And it's like, you know as much as I didn't like her too much
She you know, she had something to struggle for at least, you know right up until
the end there but um
I would have to go with captain marvel
That mmo star wars the old republic had all sorts of great stories without force lightsabers, etc

Oh
Yeah, because mass effect three ended really bad. It's like they tried to fix it and it only kind of half did it
Well, they didn't work out because they they made a really big promise and it didn't happen
And there's a lot of skepticism as to who's fault it is
By the way, our mad lib has just been posted in a chat uh head on do you want to uh,

Yes
He says yes silent treatment, okay
All right, good stuff, okay

Uh check er's twitter. There's a hot joker take there
Oh, yeah, I uh, I actually did because I saw that one ahead. Um, I can't remember what it was
but it was like
I think we read it out or at least I showed somebody but there was another one that he had retweeted where um
They blocked the oh from joker out like as if it's a swear word
Like they put an asterisk there
Like if they were to say the name of the movie it would bleep and it's just like what the fuck
I didn't realize like who's that offensive but okay
I I've seen that multiple times actually not just there but like during
Like the infancy of the joker's release movie. There was a lot of people just bleeping the joker word and I think that has
I think that has something to do with youtube. Remember when we read that list of things you weren't allowed to say and joker was on there
So, I think that might have been it I don't know joker is one of them was
Yeah, holy fuck you're still going I had a whole shift
And we're now still still going
Party never ends. Uh, so enjoy us in the car on the way back
I thought I was gonna say hi to my unlisted n words, but you're still going. Love you guys. Also. Hi rags
Hello as well. If you're still there
You're still expecting to see unlisted n words and you're seeing listed n words
Uh
I hope you're doing well
Uh hit about them leaks. Anakin should have killed us all. Yeah. Well, it wouldn't have mattered because we'd all probably come back
Anyway
Yeah, we'd come back and we'd be better than ever
Um
I'm efappen in bed with some whiskey sargon and arch wen
That could happen in almost happened today. Uh, we were looking for uh guests because
I the guests I had in mind didn't work out
but timing wise and then um, uh, funnily enough
uh
A lot of people get asked and then they can't make it and then like a few days later
They're like actually I can and it's like oh fuck
We already have six people all of a sudden yes. Um, well, that's the thing we we had nearly a forecast today
It happens. It's all good. We handle everything was handled
um
anyway
I'm, oh, yeah, uh, now give me an uwu doggo. I saw that last pic of you
I'm, not sure what that means. Exactly. I'm upset. You still haven't seen hardcore henry. I'll see it eventually
I'll do it. I've been meaning to like I had got that movie
And I put it on my phone and I was ready to watch it on the plane
And I guess uh the app that I was using to watch the video just couldn't read the fucking thing
So I was kind of I was left to watch the last jedi on the fucking plane on the
What was available and that's how I saw the last jedi on a plane well, you know, there are worse ways to suffer
Maybe I guess at least I didn't pay money to it
If someone doesn't lose their virginity by 25 should we throw them off a roof?
Hmm I have to consult the elders and the spiders they'll know they'll know what we decide to do and we will decide to do
What about that from that? It'll make sense
Yes, damn you guys are still going it's funny reading these with it from a different stream
Uh best drunk movie is shawn of the dead. I think that's a pretty good drunk movie. Sure
It's a great movie. I'd say this is a great movie in general. Yeah
Yeah
Um, do you guys think god is the answer to nihilism?
I mean for some people um
Yeah, I mean there's a lot of people who just they they can't seem to live without you know
believing there's a deity helping them out and
You know
Giving them something to do with their lives
Anything and gotta find meaning somewhere if you feel that nihilism isn't a good enough
End point you want more?
Yeah, pretty much. So, you know go for it if it's for you, man
Uh you massive release doom video also, I think it's six out of ten
I think it's probably like that's still not up. Is it no and it's still uh
Still I think it was three days ago. It got hit with a copyright claim again. We're still working on it. Oh my
God, why doom of all things and ironically now we've been working on this thing for like months
And it's like a 40 minute video where we just laugh at doom
Um, almost every other efap movies is ready to go, but they have continuity
So you guys are just going to get a blast of fucking efap movies suddenly and you'll be like, why did?
It is
But it's coming it's coming
um
Anyway still going why is despol should a fairy not bad not mad. Sorry
You're a fairy apparently for the backstory. It's yeah. Yeah. Well for the backstory is actually uh,
I used to play guild wars too
Um, I don't really want to play mmo's anymore because like the games industry has decided that everything has to be an mmo
Uh-huh, uh almost everything
Uh, but uh, this is this is a char from guild wars two
I have a warrior and so I decided shit i'll just get them drawn. Why not? Oh, there you go. That's my char warrior guy
Good
Are you guys efap to chris tuckman's review of tlj? If so, which efap?
No, we haven't and I don't know that like any ef
Chris tuckman video is like really boring to efap too i'd say
Um, what was the last chris tuckman video that we watched?
I don't think we've ever covered him on efap
I I thought we did and I don't know I could be wrong
I think we may have referenced it but I don't think we've ever actually watched one and it would be a while before we
You'd have to have a pretty tismy take to cover him
He mostly is like the most inoffensive person ever and that's part of why he sucks
Um, hey guys, may the don bless you why thank you don bless you all
Uh, hey rags, do you know of john cjg the creator of arby and the chief I do
I don't think he does he talks about a lot of the same stuff as efap. We'd love to see him on here someday
I mean if he's interested
Yeah, i'm pretty sure he's still making episodes of arby and the chief actually
Really? Yeah, because uh fringy's been telling me about him
Wow, I thought he just straight up ended that
Yeah
Uh, there was that quite a definitive ending and one of the earliest seasons, but I think you could decide to carry it on
Um
Yeah, I mean if if ever he showed interest to come on efap we'd have him on would be fun talking to arby and chief
I'd love to talk to him about arby and the chief. All right, and the final super chat of episode 60 may the don be with you
Hmm
So we made it through all the previous ones then. Yep. Now we're finally to this stream
Um, yeah, you know that wasn't very long. It kind of sucked that we had to cut off points
Yeah, I know right. It was just the extra like i'd say 20 minutes is all we needed. I think I said it was about 20 minutes
Yeah, not too bad
Also, someone in chat said I love johnny talked about you guys a few days ago. Is that true?
Was it was it in a good light?
Do you know they've been 12 on stream about a woman
Yeah
Well john cjg if you like this stuff, uh, we'd be happy to have you
Yeah, somebody time stamp this even though you can't right now because it's not processed
And send it to him where we say
We really like your stuff big fans have actually have arby and the chief to it to a certain degree
I watched the shit out of them before I don't really watch them right now
But I would happily talk about that stuff with you if you're interested and um, have you on assuming you don't hate us
Which is also a possibility
You gotta cover all your bases, you know
Pretty much. Yeah. Anyway
Uh, here we go. There's a suspicious amount of women on this efap. That's a very suitable super chat
We did have a suspicious amount of women
Efap on our thursday a surprise to be sure but a welcome one. Oh
Uh in the words of axel from kh2
to
a uh
I think he's referring to kingdom hearts too. Oh
I don't know that one. I've not played that game
I haven't played any of the kingdom hearts series, but axel sounds like a kingdom hearts character. So
There we go
Why is it that we do when we want to don't?
well
sometimes
Your emotions can get in the way of a pragmatic choice or vice versa
You could feel you want to do something, but pragmatically it's too important, you know
Keep me up at night, man
Uh mola, why are you torturing women to the wrath of cinema roberto because more people need to fear him?
Okay, that is the guy they were
Like all of them wolf j long bone and star wars girl all had headaches during his video, huh? Yeah. It's um
Kind of undeniable. He's very talented at that
Like if anything weird, he needs to look into that like as a power
That might be like diabeto's power. He gives people headaches too much. Yeah, he gives them big
He gives them a sugar crash without the high
Women oh my good christmas podcast. Oh my good christmas podcast. Yes
Um, oh I get it
Oh my god, not movie bob also howdy. Anna j long bone mola rags and last but not least wolf
Love you all very kind james. Um, i'm sure they'd all have said hi
Hey man estimate date for the meme efap mini
Uh
Yeah, there's nothing that I really need to get on that that's my bad
I'm gonna definitely get on get on that. Sorry i've been because I only for a second there
I was just like i've not been doing it. What's wrong with me?
I was like, oh well infin is I really recently finished the whole all the batwoman editing and then all the tisms with sorting out the
Uh different efaps as well as the copyright stuff. It's definitely i'll sort out. I swear to god. Um
It's the same. I feel bad for the fucking meme stream the literal meme stream
It's still locked away and it could still be locked away for another 40 days before it's on moola
But it will be viewable. Hopefully within 10 days or around 10 days. So
Think of that as a december christmas thing that it's coming. The meme stream is coming
And wolf is beautiful true. Yeah
Uh cats has a budget of 300 million why
300 million do you really think that we can answer such philosophical questions?
Not possible
These are these are the questions that people aren't even meant to answer
It just hurts to know man
Uh, what are wamen doing on an incel podcast?
Well, they're incels too
I mean, you know like someday they will you will shoot up a movie theater for playing the wrong movie
exactly
You know, i'm not saying that like
They're not welcome unless they're incels on this podcast, but that is what i'm saying
Mm-hmm. Like it kind of kind of disgusts me that someone who's had sex would be on here who isn't rags. It's like what the hell?
I
Mean, what do you guys think he's been doing this whole time? He's got to charge his batteries if you know what I mean, that's
Fine by me. Someone's got to get them charged. You know, we are the incel leftist podcast
Ah, yes, who is also nazi right-wingers. Mm-hmm. Oh god, like I haven't been procrastinating enough. Well
This is seven hours and 17 minutes so far of extra procrastination fuel if you
If this is if movie bob is your thing
If that is the case I apologize
Just for you
Uh hail massives. Hey rags kick j. He's already been pre-kicked this stream comes pre-kicked
Mm-hmm. Remember to water your jabs folks also high rags
Again, he would be saying hi right now. He's just a little tied up
And I don't mean that in a bdsm way
Uh, all he said well, you don't know that all he said was that uh, he has to go he'll be back I think
Okay
Um
Yeah, like I said, I just hope he's all right like the amount of time he's been missing without a message
My brain immediately goes to like, uh, I hope something nothing really bad has happened
Uh-oh silence on the internet means death. That is the only reason he had a really big fart and then he got tired and fell asleep
Yeah
But uh, yeah, um
Free super chat for rags. Well, I will make a note of you
Did you ever see jurassic world battle at big rock surprisingly good in my opinion for such a short video
I only had people link me at saying it was terrible. I forgot to watch it
Like, um
A couple of fans did and wolf sent me at saying this is terrible. So
I'm assuming it's not fantastic
I don't know though. Uh, you guys are aware of the whole copper situation. I've heard I watched the chad tronic video
I've seen a lot of takes on twitter. I think all that's left to do now is wait
Who knows what they're going to do exactly? I don't think it's feasible for them to fucking
Uh fine people across country lines. I think it's going to get extremely complicated
But yeah, that's absurd. There's got to be like I think they're going to review it like the closer it gets
And uh, I guess we'll just kind of it's just kind of a wait and see situation
It just seems too ridiculous. It kind of sounds like
It also feels like a law that they might put in place that doesn't get acted upon as in like they're like we did it
We passed it now to implement it. It's like I don't fucking you won't fucking implement this
I don't know. I don't know how to do internet like in the in the idea that they're like being bad is now illegal
And there's like a kid who pushes another kid and then they're like that's illegal. They're like, what are you gonna do arrest him?
Okay
Um
So, yeah, we'll have to see what happens. Uh, very happy to see all of you big. Thanks y'all
Thank you for watching
Uh free super chat for that star wars girl
Noted though. She's got a stream going right now. Just

Because it'll be less uh stuff take it off. I would imagine with transfers and stuff
She's currently streaming on her channel with the the jack stream. I believe it's called. She's it's like the jack podcast
um
A suspicious amount of women here. Oh and hyregs
You would say hello
I'm flying to india from norway soon. I'm pretty sure this stream will be going on till I reach my destination
Hello that jeb girl and jeb longboned

Yeah
So congratulations, you did better than ryan johnson free super chat for jay longbone free super chat for jay longbone
All hail jebimus prime leader of the jebo jebo bots also hyregs
Yeah, it makes sense. The jeba was prime would be the leader of the jebo bots. I don't see why that's not confusing to me. Um
Father grant me slice. What about dice though?
You can't have one without the other that doesn't make sense
Elizabeth banks has said fasten. Yeah
Elizabeth banks has said charlie's angels failed at the box office because men are too naive to enjoy female cinema and they are scared of women
Well, I don't understand why they go for that take all the goddamn time
Well in fitness, you just hate women. It's like we you prove it's just not true
I watched the trailer for charlie's angels and I was terrified. I was looking I was in the corner shaking
Like I got a blankie in a teddy bear. I was fucking
shaking
Say the least
Um, because breasts are scary
Just just strong intelligent women making choices that there's nothing scary than that. Um, you never lose
And you know what it's weird. She's right. Uh, have you noticed that like all like female led films
just just don't make money and they're not successful like, um
Like that captain marvel film complete flop wonder woman flop
Uh force awakens flop the last jedi flopped
Rogue one flopped like fucking hell. It's just it's undeniable men
Cannot watch women films
I'm glad we've noticed this
No, anyway, hello my jab words
Depending on your takes nando may organize another one marvelous senesk video essay collab around taking down efap
Also, hi rags. Oh dude, that would be wonderful
Like every video essayist makes a video on how bad we are
You imagine the fucking free press that would be like oh man, and then like they need to
well
I was wondering if they should like do a
Collaboration video make it like really goddamn long just despite the long men
It begins with like patrick williams being like there's a problem on youtube
And it goes to just right and it's like and that problem is efap
And it's like
It'd be great
Slick editing loads of references to how we ruin everything and then it'd be like this innocent woman
Jenny nicolson was targeted by these people
So
That would be like the fucking best efap ever covering that we just bring on like fucking 12 people to do it
Uh leaks confirmed jj does cocaine. Oh
I kind of saw that coming
Free super chat for the rhino spiders. Oh, they know what's up the spiders can see everything coming
So they know exactly where to go in what ways to get easy money
Um, so for example, they walk into an arcade
Or like a gambling machines and stuff
They'll be like, all right
Go to that machine press this button and this coin at this time and they get all the money. They'll be fine. No worries
Uh free super chat for wolf
very well
do do do
Love to see you guys react to star wars fan films and compare how much better they are than disney
Especially shards of the past from star wars theory
There could be copyright issues with that also
I don't know. I don't want to like what if we end up raining on someone's parade with those and
It's gonna come across as pretty ass. Holy to be like, hey fan film. You should be doing this, you know
And it's like why don't you guys make it?
Wow, your production value sucks. Wow, jesus
But I can say they saw that they're gonna be better than anything the fucking sequel trilogy has to office. So
Don't worry about that. I'm just waiting for the next one. That's gonna be insane. Oh, yes
Thursday two women what is happening? Someone hold me i'm scared
You'll be okay, buddy. You'll be okay
I'll make it through this. There's just six hours to go
Quite literally. Yeah. Hello long man wamen and wolf
Hello you
maula reviews movie about space wizards for children copper. That'll be forty thousand dollars
Yeah, I don't I don't picture they could do that but you know, baby
Oh, it's just such a weird scenario to even be considering
Um
Damn it guys. I had stuff to do today do the stuff you could just listen to us in the background. It'll be fine
Yeah, but what if he's working with adio?
Um
Tool is just smash mouth for virgins. Oh my god
Oh my i'm gonna copy that for wolf
And I copy by the way every question i've ever said that i've copied and pasted
They are all in this thing and I realize I should have looked for ones that have anything to do with jay longbow
And I think there may have been one
There's a lot i'd have to search through but yes, uh, i'll have to search there somewhere i'm going for jay apparently
I hope the people who ask these questions watch every single episode thoroughly
Yeah, you will say no more than we do you will get your ads of that. I swear
Um and a normal super chat for maula. Have a nice day guys. Thank you. Eric stewart. Thank you very much. Thank you
Good to see that star wars girl in efap. You're all awesome. Also. Hi rags. He would have said hi
Hello
Free super chat for maul. Er
I'll give it mall er
You're nazi now
Would it be okay to make videos named unbridled rage slash praise and why do you not like john wick two exactly?
So firstly, yes, anyone can use the unbridled rage praise thing doesn't bother me go for it
It's just a descriptive of what's happening in the video. I'm not patenting that you'll be fine
Um, thank you
The only thing you'd really have to be worried about is the people who don't listen to the efap podcast will probably like go
Whoa, man, what a fucking rip-off. Oh, yeah, you probably just have to deal with strangers, you know
You might have a couple people saying you're ripping me off
Um, but I mean i'm assuming the video is not gonna be like the same thing
Even if it is as long as you're doing it. Well, right like for the different movie
It should work out. Okay, pretty much
um
All right
Uh, wait, what was the oh, yeah, why don't you not like john wick two exactly? So here's the thing
um
I despise john wick two
And then I watched john wick three with fortier with alcohol and we laughed throughout the whole thing. So it was so bad
Then I i've told i've said this on efap before but I know that this might be new for a lot of people
Uh, you fast forward a bit and metal commander as you guys all know him
He decided he was he was free one day and he wanted to chill out and he and he asked me if there's anything new
He should watch and I was like, oh you should probably watch the new john wick
You'll probably like it because you know, he liked john wick too and I was like, yeah, just go for it
And so he did and as he was watching it, he just kept sending me messages
Like this is stupid. This is fucked up. This makes no sense. This is dumb. What the fuck and I was just like, um
Have you put these into like just a notepad and he was like why and I was like because like
You've almost sent me enough here to like make a video and you may as well
I mean fucking nobody talks about how bad the job wick sequels are
And then he was like well, it's because the the segwood's not that bad though. And I was like, hmm
And he was just like, okay, and then um, I brought it up
with uh fringy because obviously he loves john wick as a franchise and he was like, yeah third one
Isn't fantastic
And he referenced like the end of the third almost something really stupid happens to john
And I was just like there's a lot more than that. What's wrong with that one?
And I think we talked about it for a while and broke it down until he was like, yeah
Third one's not very good. But the first and second are very good. And I was like, hmm
Then he was like what's wrong with the second one
and um after several conversations, uh a rewatch with wolf and a lot of
Uh, what you call dissection with metal
Fringy has now concluded that john wick two and three are bad
And the first one's very good and metal is going to make a video for both john wick three and two
Hopefully give enough time
um
And so I don't want to spoil anything
But um, it does seem to be a take that hardly anyone has
The john wick two is bad
And yet wolf thought it was fucking terrible fringy has completely turned on it rags even says that it's it's fun
It's not very good
And um, I know that a shit ton of people
Are very much in favor of uh of john wick two. So I don't know but I still think john wick
Like we we we watched john wick one
And we've looked at arguments against john wick one john wick one still holds up better than the other two by far
Um, and that's my job. I would have to agree
With uh reg is that it's it's fun, but it's not really anything that you should be looking to in terms of
You know
What it's like to do things right in terms of the writing like that. I it was particularly jarring
Well, I probably shouldn't say too much. Anyway, it's just a fun movie
I'm, also the kind of guy that also liked terminator three because I also thought it was a fun movie
But in terms of story and how they did things like retconned a few things
Judgment days inevitable. It's like oh jesus christ
But all the practical effects and stuff characters. It was fun movie
um
Yeah, metal will come out with his john wick three video
Hopefully within the next month
And then it was kind of like depending on if people actually want to see it he'll make a john wick two one as well
So I don't really want to say anything
But uh, yeah, look out for those. It'll be fun
Uh, anyways, hi rags. Kick j and love you wolf
He loves back and rag says hi back in spirit
Unlike wu tang clan efap isn't for the children
This is true
Uh, nando is the name of my roommate. I asked him how he incurred the wrath of the long man and co
He said he wasn't gamer enough and he's sorry. Oh
Well, you know if if you apologize for not being gamer enough, I I can see
An apology there like i'm i'm all right with it. You're doing okay
Uh, thanks for making my 10 hour shift less massive uwu. Why are you going to say the uwu?
Why are you going to why are you going to why are you going to make it weird?
But yeah, no good stuff. We'll keep you company
That means that guy has got what potentially two and a half hours left of it if it started at the exact same time
Which is incredibly unlikely but
possible
um
Rags is to mauler as milk is to bilbo
That sounds oddly sexual, but i'll take it
You know, we don't have to don't have to look into it. It's fine
Yeah, have some youtube money. Thank you watch season one of buffy. It was good
Really? Most people don't think it's good a lot weirder than I expected i'm interested to see what happens next
Although willow's boyfriend being a robot was a bit hilarious. That's the episode. It's called. Um
I robot no I
It's a play on I robot. I think it's I robot you jane actually. It's a play on the
The um
Tarzan thing
um
Well, I might be fucking that up
It doesn't matter the the point is that that episode is possibly the worst one in the season and season one is pretty weak, but
It gets really good
but around
The end of season two and mostly onward
Mauler is trace. Jay is fiora or flora wolf is keith rags is natani. Don't ask just read it
All right, done. I'm gonna assume that's an anime
But um, it's fine
Guys, I have real life stuff to do on weekdays
It's okay
Just do the real life stuff treat. This is a backup for that one day where you have absolutely nothing to be able to watch
It could happen
Uh maula my gf hates jeb nickels
well
I suppose that makes some sense. She doesn't appeal to everybody I guess
Jeff nickels is uh, you know
You certainly didn't appeal to us. I can say that much
Yeah
um
Free super chat for that writing and rage fellow
noted
It's time for another jeb build alt right incel podcast with wamans. Oh god, the narrative is derailing joker aside
How are all you doing?
Oh, sorry jokes aside
Yeah, yeah, uh joker joker aside
jokin
It's been uh, it was it was an interesting
Stream, I think we got a lot of interesting discussion on joker out there. Um
And uh, I I just need to keep on uh drinking things to make sure I don't die
So that that's it'll be fine long man. He's his milk. That's my thing
Uh, kathleen kennedy said star wars isn't like marvel because they have no source material to pull from
But star wars they had george lucas plans by the way. Yeah, she shouldn't have said that
It was um, yeah really embarrassing because they destroyed the eu
Jesus christ. Yeah, I I saw that earlier today like yes, you did you fucked it up
I like as well. It's like she's like it's hard for us. Not for you though
A lot of people would argue it's easier to make your own story instead of adapting one
Because then you got to like be really careful
Yeah, you just got to be careful with what you've already got there, which is previous material, of course
It doesn't need to be written material. You don't have to go to the books too much
I think as long as you're just respectful of the fucking characters and you don't turn them into losers before murdering them
I think you could have done. Okay
I love that idea. By the way. It's like if we had source content, we'd know not to destroy characters
Oh
Of course
That's how that works. It's my birthday and I got an efap best present. No
Happy birthday, baby boy thing
Uh efap, but with two females, what the hell is this madness? I thought this was an incel podcast I subbed
Oh
Well now you're just gonna sub now, don't you know, this is it was the reveal podcast you can have wamen who are incels
It's fine
Oh, right. It's fine. Okay, please subscribe again and ignore the last one

I
Feel like I was talking why are you ignoring me?
Oh, yeah, he fucking mistook the fact that he's been muted for like five hours. He's like, oh
I thought you guys would be in dicks
Zoo tycoon is objectively the greatest game ever made
All right, you hit it here folks
Zoo tycoon I used to play roller coaster tycoon when I was younger. Mm-hmm
Good day long man. May the dawn the jab and the cosmic chicken be with you all

Oh, okay. All right short and sweet
Um this one to j long bone very well
very well
Weekend, you know weekday efap. Is that legal jebby praised? I know
We're breaking all the rules. I just saw a look up diabeto family guy clip online. Does family guy have a diabeto joke?
Oh boy
Did we did we steal diabeto's hilarious?
I
I'm listening to this clip. I will send you
Find daddy and we'll get dinner started. You're not gonna get dinner status
She's gonna tell that sloppy old I'm gonna have to listen to importions guys because you know how copyright goes
um
Nearly there though. I'm sure made to do it and she will but only because she needs money to pay for medicine for her prematurely
I'm sure nearly to the punch line. I'm sure of it. Just breaking it up enough
Maturely overweight son diabeto
Gotcha
Oh, it's no I didn't it's not quite the same joke, but yes diabeto. It does exist in family guy
Yeah, no in our contact. It's magneto in this it's a spanish diabetes kid. Mm-hmm. Both work both work
I think ours is better because we're better people. That's my that's my totally fair take
Mm-hmm. I'm not biased. No, no, no never ever
ever ever
Get aid and complete the trinity. Oh, we'll probably do that. Uh down the line. It'll be when we cover jab nickels again
That's just too perfect of an opportunity to pass up
And i'll title should I title the thing every part of this podcast is about jenny nickels
And then people like it says it in the title though
Oh my god, I didn't read the rest
And whoever has the bigger dong keeps this one
I think rags will
Desperately want to take ownership if that's the rules you'll be like
Mm-hmm. I have the biggest dong. How dare you yeah, but he's not here. So I guess we know who the true biggest dong is
Uh, I love these jab don and tonal people
Yeah, jab don and tonal. They they they kind of
They make efap, you know
Very important every time I every time I miss it. I hear his name. I miss him all the more
Yeah, I see his face every day. It's such a legend. He's been gone now for nearly three months
I know it's a bummer. It's a serious bummer. I hope he's doing okay. Mm-hmm
Need them monthly thrusts, man
Uh-huh
Good to see jay longbone back i've been enjoying all the batwoman coverage from you guys
Yeah, like I said, batwoman videos are fucking great
Yeah, like it's it's a good companion thing with with efap or you know vice versa because it's just like
You jump into her take that I would take there's loads of other people like that show
Is really good
Watching people watch it
It's it's fantastic. Yeah, I like to watch jay longbones first and then I go over to efap and like get the
Uh on the uncut director's cut version whatever you want to call it. It's pretty great
We get to look at so many women in this episode. Also. Anna is my number one celebrity crush
Fasho
The show that show
for show for show
Um, yeah, that's it's a fair choice
So I think rags would be upset as would I
We should be number one and joint number one. Obviously molar. It won't let me send quotes from no bullshit
Oh like in super chat, do they censor it?
I'm assuming it's the debates are gay or whatever. You can't say gay. That's offensive
Um, even though it's accurate debates truly are the big gay
Uh, please give this to jay and then kick him and take it away. Oh
Damn damn. Yeah. Oh just imagine it with like a like like a little cup
You kick him
I say that it's fine to efap early just as long as it's within a week apart
I
Mean these won't be a week apart
We got we just had one a few days ago and we're gonna have another one a few days from now
We're sorry really when?
Sunday night
Afternoon well Sunday night afternoon for rags and monday morning for australians
Which should give you a big clue as to who our guests are gonna be
Haha
And we've got the efap after that already booked
um
So much efap in in this this month, but you see it's because episode nine is about to steamroll through efap, you know
Oh, yeah
That'll be the focus so much episode nine
Um, sorry for asking this again, but would you guys like to see the tismi efap story I wrote?
I think the sleep tisms got you distracted sunday
It depends
if it's like
The whole meme story thing then I don't really understand it through the memes, but if it's like a full-on
You know book thing
Probably not like 20 pages. It really depends. He got 20 pages and printer paper
Too wamen you're killing the patriarchy. Well
If it's so easily killed then perhaps it should be killed
That's good logic, right? We can't have that. Yeah, I can't have that weak shit
Mm-hmm
Uh, I got an a on a thesis paper talking about how shit ray's character is in tlj. She is long man and co
Hey, not bad
Oh, what kind of you know, I wonder what kind of class that was that's pretty cool actually is it for
For film or english or something
Yeah, I have a feeling that
Depending on the quality of the writing you probably could have gotten an a if you had said she was a great character and argued
It well enough, but I I don't know like I just like the idea that the teacher was like, yeah
She's a shit character. Hey
yeah
Which is weird because you know, you don't know colleges for
The takes that actually make sense like that like well, you can't criticize that way when you're you're here because you were supposed to tow
a certain line
And then biasing its colleges right now
Um
Fuck mary kill kit master fisto fisto kiai the daddy mundi or dexta come dine with me jester
Okay
um
Wait a minute. I need okay, so I know dextra jester, but I don't know these other two caddy mundi and kit fisto
My god, not a true star wars fan
Caddy mundi was killed by the clones kit fisto was killed by palpatine
Um
Well, I guess you go with fuck kit fisto because you got the anime tentacle thing
I never saw prequel movie two and three. I only saw the first one. Whoa
You didn't see those
I probably should
Just for the for the sake that everyone else has, you know, I mean, yeah keep you up to date, right?
Yeah, if I if i'm gonna be on this podcast and be for reals, I gotta fucking do that
You shouldn't have told everyone that they know they're gonna think you're gonna think you're a fraud. Yeah
Yeah, now i'm gonna get kicked shit
They know the truth, sir
um
Yeah, okay. So fuck fisto makes enough sense. I think
Uh, we got marion kill left. I'm gonna kill jester
um
It's just he's too thick for me. Okay, i'm putting it out there
And uh, it's too grabby with those hands
And and he seems dirty doesn't wash a lot even though he's wearing a diner
He just doesn't seem to care and that's just not you know cool with me and then marry kiatty mundi
he seemed to care about, you know the droid attack on the wookiees and that's
Genuinely how I feel that that he's a good man. So
Yeah, here you go. Those are my answers. Um
You're reading the leaks like the resistance sees hundreds of palpatine star destroyers
I heard of hundreds of palpatines that my phone died and I thought for an entire 10 minutes. JJ created clothes of palpatine
Hundreds of palpatines
I mean, do you really think that they won't do that? You know, there's a chance just saying yes. Yeah
Um
First time catching efap live should also check out a japanese commercial called long long man could make some good memes with that
Uh e-man gameplay, I believe
Made one of the first memes with that he we showcased it on efap live and then it ended up in my tfa part two
Um
It is quite suitable. It's good shit
Wow maula, you brought two wamans on the wamen hating alt left right podcast
What kind of basement dwelling in cell are you get a girlfriend already?
Why would I do that? I'm scared of them. I mean is elizabeth banks wrong. I don't think so
Yeah
Trying to say we can't trust elizabeth banks. That's fucked up
Saw joker knew about everything because I didn't care when I watched you guys
But my gf didn't and bro was one was I was watching my gf and little bro react the whole time
My said I have a favorite movie now. Hi wagyu
I'm glad you have a favorite movie now or whoever did say that. I got a little bit confused there. Um
It's good shit. I feel like we're kind of cracking through to that in these podcasts where we cover
People's tismy takes on joker
That guy's recommendation for fixing the script for example kind of like oh my goodness, please no
but you know
I popped back in and saw some segments of this like oh, maybe I should wait for later. Please stop
Stop
So think about arguing with it
He's like he really wanted them wanted to argue with a girlfriend
It's like he really wanted joker to start abusing a woman. It was insane
Hmm
So good news efap. The movie is progressing nicely now
It's going to be nice and long keep up the good work and remember to water your jabs. You'll be very important later
Um, all right the efap movie. I have no idea what exactly that is
but
color me excited
Watch it be like the greatest thing ever like no joke
I
Am a child watching this stream stole my mommy's card
Haha pee pee poo poo in the rooftop water closet with the door open so rags can see
Oh
I'm sorry, right
Surprise. There's the efap. The dawn is smiling upon us all. Oh, absolutely
And what a fine smile it is. Yeah, I wouldn't imagine anything less
Hi rags. I want to send you the darth bane trilogy. Is there any way?
Um, I will save this for him
Do do in case he has a specific answer for that that I am not aware of
Also, you guys thoughts on the movie troy, it's my third favorite movie also hi anna and jay longbone
I like troy. I rewatched it about a year ago. And I remember thinking you know what ain't so bad
But maybe i'm unaware of how bad it really is. I don't know
I have fun with it. I'm not familiar. Maybe i'll have to uh, go into seattle around december. Maybe if uh
If it's as good as you say, maybe i'll grab it
It's kind of old movie. I think it's like 2004 or something. But um, yeah, we we looked at one of them
Sorry
That's okay. One of my favorite movies. Uh collateral, I believe was uh, 2001
Oh, no, I just mean
I don't know how easy it'll be if you find like on a shelf or something. But yeah
No, i'm not doing it a shelf. I'll just find it digitally somehow. Mm-hmm
Um
Just came from rags's video where you roasted movie bob. Yes. Oh we were you know
Five hours ago
He's never going to come on now, dude
As if he was ever gonna come on like really that's true
That's true. So you might as well seal a deal and have some fun, right?
I would love it if he tweets out a screenshot of the thumbnail and he's like
These incels made a 10 hour podcast on mary and no one cares
Doesn't get like retweeted or anything. It's just like go away bob
Yeah, you should put like
Put like one of the the diabeto's like in the thumbnail
Dude if he if anything on twitter like that happens i'll be like
Why would you criticize like those people drew some fan art? I just sent him a folder of diabeto
Um
Um
Bodmer slash pemdas test
negative three plus three times four times five
Exclamation plus six times seven plus eight. I mean
Okay, I I can't do be doing that shit right now
But if it I don't know if it works with both or works better with one, uh
I'm assuming
That it works the same with both or whatever. I don't I don't know. I can't remember if there's actually like significantly, um
significant difference between
Bodmas and pemdas
That conversation was enlightening. That was the aiden stream actually, but yes
you
Uh 10 minutes late, so I missed about one percent of the horror. Yes, unfortunately
Still you're just that much more sane
Uh so much i'd like to say to thank you but every time I type the dollar amount goes up
So thanks for reading this in your monotone voice you massive. I don't think i'm monotone. I think that's an outrageous claim
See that's different tones
Yeah, got him nailed it. Thank you
An efap on my birthday praise be the dawn. That was from e-man. Happy birthday. We got another birthday. Yeah, happy birthday, man
Uh maula dankmas and real gyms equals good simpsons vids
Dankmas and real gyms the real gyms. Are they channels?
Good simpsons vids
Oh wait, I think it's saying dankmas and the real gyms have good simpsons videos
Um fair enough
I do like me some simpsons
Uh sneaky ones
What
They're still going aren't they what are they on there like their 28th season? Oh simpsons. Yeah
Jesus
Yeah, we're still coming sneaky ones. I you forgot to remind me for this efap. Well, we didn't tell anybody about this
In fact, I was like suggesting it to uh rags and wolf and then wolf just like put it on twitter
He was just like, oh efap's happening. I was like, dude, we don't even know
Like for sure. Okay
You're creating expectations. That's the worst thing to do
Um, i'm surprised to watch anime with theo in two hours and they need to eat by the dawn
Why is this on a thursday regardless? Have a fun stream you incels
Have a fun watch of anime you my fellow incel
I hope it's a good one. There's not many
Yeah, there's like three good ones the rest of them are terrible
Uh, hey wolf
Have you checked out clamavi depro fundus yet? I am gonna save this question
It sounds like the big game i'm being honest with you
Yeah
Like who would read?
You'd be honest
God in the in this current year, jesus
What are you guys's thoughts on rvb
Red versus blue are oh red versus blue
Uh, it's good stuff when I watched it like years ago. I don't really know what's going on with it right now
It was pretty you know, it was quaint, um
Later on they kind of seemed like they were farting around a lot
like they
They stuck on one joke and then kind of stretched it out
for like
too long got pretty bad and then
Uh monty ohm showed up and started animating some of those fight scenes. Those fight scenes were pretty fucking sick. Um
and then unfortunately, uh, he
Passed away and I hadn't really kept up since then but rvb had a pretty uh, it was pretty solid
One of the funniest thing in the world, but you know, I got some got some smiles here and there. I enjoyed my time with it
Oh, there you go. I don't know about it at all. Honestly
Also molar I serious about need this money for rent
Uh, all right, just keep it for red. Also chat. Can I get a you're fucked up. Can I get a pad around?
Shit chat. He wants you to say pad around
Shoot, I need to fill the enemy 150 word. Oh, and he did. There you go
Bob I don't go get the rooftop. Oh, I get it like the the second bob speaks. You can get that
top
Um, I was gonna finish rewatching the boys tonight
There's a tonaled 1.2 billion reference in episode one, but i'm ready for another sleepless night of fapping
See that's commitment right there fellas
That's what we call payment
Um, hi rags. Thanks jay for finally booking anna
Thanks. Oh again because he's he's the manager. That's true. He's the manager
Um, how many guests will a movie bob video take down today? Also. Hi rags technically
Did he get rags did rags die between videos or did he die during the
I felt like he died between
He made it through and then maybe he kind of had the little death lurch through his house and then just keeled over
Yeah, that must have been just long enough to see it to the end and then he died
And then you go that stoveskill took some painkillers. So that counts as at least a half kill partial kill. Mm-hmm
Wolf took several breaks
So he was like resurrected several times. I think that still counts as a kill
So yeah movie bob's doing pretty great. Honestly, very good record at this point
The body count keeps going good job. Bob. I'm not gonna take it away from you
Um, nobody tell bob who invented rockets
It doesn't matter he deserves to have his robotic body talking to sentient ai
I just love the idea that he actually feels that like the will took that from him by being lesser than him
Like how did how could he possibly be taken seriously by the left like shouldn't they consider him to be a fucking idiot?
Ah
I have a hard time
with just
Whether or not any of this is true anymore
This is just his bob a hallucination
I know his bob been here has been has even placed here to just test us all because I feel like that's what it is
Bob chipman is the titanic if youtube but not as tragic because everyone knew this would happen with him
I mean
I don't think he's ever going to stop making videos. I don't know why escapist would have rehired him. That's such a weird choice
Did they can him at first?
I think he went separate ways with them, but then rejoined them. I really don't know because I know he started out with him
I think right. Oh, did I lose you?
You know something went weird. Hello
Am I back?
Am I back?
Uh, yeah
Excellent. Uh, I was just saying that was weird. Singapore did that and everything singapore. Why?
um
yeah, as far as I know he uh
He like left escapist start with them then left them and then rejoined them and I just
I don't know. I guess they really wanted extra content of some kind. I think you can call that content in some universe
It's possible. Yeah, I guess I guess escapist really couldn't say no because for a while like in its infancy
They had plenty of shows and now they've got like two
Two
I'm just looking at chats frozen. It's spooking me
Yeah, I don't know what was going on here. We it gets a chat kind of felt it too. Oh
There we go
Are we good? All right, as long as it keeps moving. I know things are alive
Um, i'd also like to note that bob made fun of that kid for whining that life supply of chicken for being fat
Despite the fact that he's also fat that tweet about the the chicken kid was weird all about it was weird
Um, so bob made fun of a fat kid
I I can't remember specifically he was talking about like how
The child looks like a 50 year old something something something teamster. I think I can't remember it was like
Bob
Why would you make fun of a little kid for his looks?
Like you're just inviting a response there a very specific response
Bob you got to pick on adults. Come on, dude
Um
Mola my male member is very small and i've been letting ra and rags double team my boyfriend carl, but here's my question
And then there's no question
Strange but I will allow it rags. I often produce stool samples with my lab door open for you. Oh
Oh, see some people think that's weird. I think that's kind. It's considerate. Um
That they're chose trust. Yeah, and they're just trying to let rags explore some new stuff. I don't know. Come on
anything
Um eight hours has passed. Yes, we've hit eight hours exactly actually
Um, though, I will say i'll pace on this is going faster than I expected. We might be able to get done by 12 hours
How fucking sad is it like insane is that like you're like, oh it's going fast. It'll only be four hours
Let's fucking do it
Hi wolf rags and mola take my shackles why thank you kathleen kennedy's calcified queef
Wow
Is that a name or just this message that's just the message it says chia's wolf at the end of it
oh
All right, then i'm i'm taken by surprise by that congrats, sir
Do taxon has been really weird on twitter lately
Yeah, there's been loads. God. He has
loads of tweets about
efap
And really passive aggressive really bitter and it's interesting because um
like
I think jay is trying to straddle a sense of like, yeah, you know
Taxum cool. Uh, we cool everything cool, but it's difficult a lot of those tweets coming out. Um
There was an argument that was like
Oh, we don't get it in relation to efap. The arguments are supposed to be bad
I was like who the fuck ever said that like yeah, it was a quote
I was like what?
Please
I don't know that anybody's defended
Efap by saying the arguments are supposed to be bad. I was just like, okay
Lots of weird stuff on uh on twitter. Yeah
Um twitter sucks shit, dude
And uh, yeah, and we still get messages from someone's like you're gonna cover the video on rags like I think at this point
Like I didn't honestly this wasn't my take at first, but i'm starting to get really convinced by it
I think we're dealing with like a standard troll like don't feed the trolls sort of situation
It really seems like that because boy boy fucking howdy. I have never seen two people try this goddamn hard
To antagonize somebody that they don't even watch
it's like so
I don't know. It just kind of seems like they're really trying for attention and it's kind of to the point where
I feel like we shouldn't even just give it to him
Well, this is the thing uh, it may have it would have worked if the video did more damage, but it was just
It's not particularly well made and the overall message is rags
Is has subtle bigotry and that makes him the worst person on youtube. It's like
subtle bigotry argument doesn't really follow through there
And um, there's loads of like there's loads of cut uh elements to it as well. There's somebody who's posting
Like timestamps and responses whenever there's tweets about it. It's just funny
Oh, yeah, that was something someone noticed as well that kind of turned me on this
They're like whenever you see a bigger tweet from tax in relation to efap
You'll often find the thread ends with a plug
Like hey check out my video on this hey check out my channel I cover this thing you're like
Um
So, um, yeah, yeah, they're just kind of not they're they're saying anything to get a rise and it's like do you really believe that's
The case it's like considering i've labeled them the fucking most dishonest person on youtube that i've come across
Not a big surprise whatsoever. So
Yes, very weird behavior. And um, I guess we don't want to encourage it at all that behavior. I mean
Yep, i'm gonna stay relatively clear. I suppose. Um
Oh my god, what the fuck i'm i'm back. Hey, dude
Yep, what is uh, what is up? What what happened? You're right
I had to go had to go back now, but had to go
Hey, dude
Are you in good?
Uh
feelings
Mental and physically is everything all right. Yeah, good. All's well all's well. Well, welcome back. Um, you missed
coverage of a particular litany joker take again, we did another one and um,
We looked at memes and now we're on superchats
Oh
Good good
Good good good good
And i'm filler man, yes, uh, and also that star wars girl is set to she said she will return
Other than that you've missed, uh several I want to say like 16 high rags
Oh my goodness
I'm gonna have to say one collective hello in return
Oh my god, the uh, he fab 62 the high rags episode the apex. Hello
So we I thought we were gonna get it. I don't know what's happening
I'll
put it well
I figured with the rest right, you know you get the next one and then it'll be
Because if I just say it now, then it'll be uh
Like you know, it won't come with it. It won't be in a pair, you know
All right, we'll save it for the next one
Um, here's a free super chat. Thank you
And this next one says kick rags also high rags
Hello
There you go
There you go. It's good to have him go. It's so much more natural that way, you know
um
You can never use too much lube dildo ragons
Yeah, it's a strong quote. It's an undying quote
Rags what this just says rags I will pay you to stop
It's almost referring to well you heard the man stop oh right when you were talking the super sexual tisms at the beginning of the stream I think
oh
I don't think I that ever happened. I I know those little
Those little stamps are adorable. Holy shit. Yes, they are and they don't show up on the the re-chatted chat
It's bullshit youtube needs to know why
It's downright wrong
I'm sick of this
Cold tisms, um
Let's scroll and look at some of these memes some of them are quite good. Do you think ryan was going kennedy his johnson?
Do you think ryan was going kennedy his johnson, um, if that means
Sexual favors from kennedy for johnson who knows what's going on hollywood is a weird man
And kennedy is johnson
That's a weird one. It is a weird one
undeniable
That's not safe for legal reasons
I was about to say like is he assassinating the johnson? I don't know. That's the complication of words the english language
Yeah, never know
I feel like jar jar is somewhere in the basement chained to the floor responsible for writing the sequels in exchange for his freedom and redemption
Possible i'm not going to say that that's what was in the leaks
but
Something similar to that i'd say
He's george lucas. No, no jar jar
He's writing the films and he's in the films writing the films like it's going to be this whole thing
Oh, well, holy shit. Can you imagine like they've killed all the characters?
All they have left is to bring jar jar back and then kill him
We actually made a thing about that. Like jay said he'd be really sad if they brought it back just to kill him
We'd be like hey
It's okay, he's only better that way
I mean that's basically what they've done with c3po
Yeah, they've only brought him back to kill him pretty much with everybody
Well, yes, hello metal. He's woken up
um, hey
He's on the the end shift as you says as one says with uh with eff up
um
McMuffins for everyone or maybe two how much do they cost these days waiting for charlie's angels review don't let drinker be alone
I don't even want to touch that movie
The drinker actually did a charlie's angels review. Yeah, I know I saw it
It's funny charlie's a films seems fucking terrible
Uh wolf if you could dlt the st, but you had to be kks
Delete the sequel trilogy, but you had to be kks
He has to belong to kathleen kennedy kathleen kennedy you could
Oh you have to be her
Oh
No, I ain't gonna be her
Yeah, no, well, wait, what if he becomes kathleen kennedy, but then he uses her responsibly and and then writes a better movie
Well, I guess that's up to wolf. Okay, then you live in a world where we have good star wars movies in your kathleen kennedy
Oh, well, you know, you got to take one for the team you can yeah
As long as somebody does someone take the bullet
Um, i've never seen internet historian and mola in the same room
I mean he and I sound very differently
I don't really get the impression how people are seeing my voice in him as the same but
you know
uh, we can't possibly be
We can't record together. I did try to invite him and he said he can't possibly make it, uh to an efap and any public
Uh platform with me at the very same time
um
That's obviously because we are very much different people and we have different schedules. That's all it has nothing to do with anything else
You guys are just conspiracy theorems. That's all that is ridiculous ridiculous
Uh pool boy for a year. Would you do it?
What?
Oh boy for a year
Why?
Why is that the whole super chat? Yeah, just a little boy for a year. Would you do it?
No, oh boy. So you would are you cleaning somebody's pool? Yeah, but well, what's the what do you think a pool boy does?
Oh
They sent this this these superchas are broken up and they between other ones of their own like there's a gap
Oh, of course. It's so it makes it so simple. It makes it so easy
I'm pretty sure they could have sent this in one, but I guess not. Uh, so the idea is
See, I actually thought that you have to be kathleen kennedy was more interesting
But then I guess this is another question. So what do you think rags? Uh
You get to delete
The sequel trilogy which by the way doesn't necessarily guarantee any good star wars content. It just means you delete in some crap stuff
Um, but in exchange you have to be kathleen kennedy's pool boy for a year. Would you do it? Oh got it
Okay, that makes more sense
Hmm
You must pay pretty well right like oh that would pay well probably I assume so
Uh
Man but she would like she'd probably
Like ruined pools, you know, like she ruined star wars for me
She's like that person wherever she walks things just crack and burn and turn black and she's like, oh no
This is like Godzilla walking through the city or things just melt and that yeah
I think it's a there's a simpsons episode where like mr. Burns like holds a flower and it just dies
Is that sort of thing?
It's like maybe the the water she repels water the water doesn't want around it. Yes that like just everything she
Is she she can't jump into water because she'll just hit the bottom of the pool immediately
It runs away from her in fear. You see the water crying
So instead she has to fill the pool with acid and then it all evens out and there's a problem for cleaning
Yeah, then scrappy d jumps in
Fuck that little shit. Oh shit. Yeah the scrappy do memes god. It feels like a lifetime ago
All right, like some of these memes though. Yeah, I know it's good shit, right?
Yeah, some of these are really good
Uh wolf I recently longman the entire lord of the rings trilogy extended edition in one sitting
I have to agree with a closer look that helms deep is
celestially epic
He would very much agree with that in fact wolf might even describe it as bone chilling
Bone chilling
Admiral holdo is a kathleen kennedy insert
I mean I could believe that
Like she's like they don't they almost look similar like if you do the hair dan
Maybe maybe I I don't think so. I can just I'm just gonna say it. I just I believe it
I believe it as far as i'm going with that
Oh man, if that turned out to really be the case like if there was a an email leaked or a
Sump man
That's that would be so fucked up. I believe it too. This whole trilogy this whole terrible trilogy was just in service to
her
cinematic fantasy
legal jedi
Have fun and work mr. Metal. He said he's gonna see us flip-flops later pretty racist, but okay
No sources. She had star wars episode seven through nine lined out by lucas
Yeah, but they ditched all of it and they couldn't exactly
Bring his episode nine back in once they've made a completely different seven and eight, but she's still wrong like watch him
Watch him do an episode nine that just randomly
There's a whole set of characters
The fucking opening crawl is just like previously on star wars and it just shows like a bunch of clips from people we've never seen
Before and it's like get to the reactor. We don't have enough time. Sheila
Gonna have to go alone. We're like, what the fuck is this?
She can't handle anymore captain. I don't know what's going on. But thank god
Yeah, it just shows like luke be heroic that he just looks at the screen. He's like it's it's fine. We're okay
We're okay
And that's why jaja is missing from the new ones
I'm I'm not sure what that's referring to but I think he knew better than to turn up into the sequel trilogy
No, don't speak too soon
Oh
He's alive. He's probably alive
I hope he's on a beach living at large. Jar Jar doesn't need no sequel trilogy. He's doing great. He's in some
Swamp somewhere. I like those disgusting gungans like they like their swamps. So they're like ogres
He's swimming around
talking to bushes
Yeah, kind of getting a little a little crazy in the head
Yeah
And then a fucking stormtrooper just comes in shoots him in the head because he's an he's a character that exists and he has to die
The second he's entered into the trilogy. Yeah, he just gets sliced apart and blown to pieces
It turns out jar jar was the mole and now he's dead and then it should be like oh my god
He was a clone the whole time and you're like, wait, what what?
Sir they seem to be happy when we don't kill him. It's like bring him back. Bring him back
I just I just love that you're flushing akbar out the fucking window
Then they're just like fans aren't happy with this and I can just picture kathleen handy ryan johnson being like why?
Understand I don't get it. I just don't get it. Why why don't they like our star wars movie? Are they are they sexist?
Why don't they like our vision?
Um, I used to love star wars now it's depressing well
You try and it's like joker used to be a tragedy now we know it's more of a comedy
Tlj was a tragedy episode nine is the comedy
Wasn't um joker two announced recently? Yes
Okay, you pessimistic about that, huh, I I just feel like it didn't need a sequel
um, I don't know the
I I don't know if that prevents it from getting one. I just hope it's good
Yeah, well, let's really cross our fingers on that one. I I agree. It's much more at risk with the sequel than there is with one film
Yeah, I think it's gonna be pretty hard to match up
Pretty sure as well if it does well he's gonna get more power to me
I'm pretty sure they even said he's got a potential deal to make another dc film other than joker two
Mm-hmm, and you realize if he's successful with either one or both of those he's gonna get his own dc u
Dang dude and like I find that he can pull it off
Yeah
Um
I can see raw saying no, it wasn't no, it wasn't oh my god
I uh, I think we may have gotten something wrong. I don't know
Apparently raw said that tod phillips denied the reports. I'm gonna have to look into that. Oh, okay
Well, yeah, no fair enough, uh, I already read I saw like an article about it, I don't know for sure
Yeah, I I saw it this morning. I'm like, oh, come on, man. So I guess uh, yeah, I guess that was a lie
Maybe not my cat
Yeah, I kind of hope they
don't I mean
Hollywood has made me kind of
I would actually say that is the very reason why I actually want it
It seems to be one of the very few remaining lights of hope for a potential movie. That's better than garbage
So go for it
If it's terrible, I'll always have the first joker. Anyway
It's true. The thing of it is it's like I just feel like when something gets really popular
A lot more people want to meddle with it and then they fuck it up. Yeah, I think that's fair
How it's been for a while. It'll be something to worry about
Cinematic universes they just if they just let him make a good movie
It'll it might be really good really good
But i'm actually i'm more on board giving him another dc character to do a movie for
Yeah, that'd be nifty and it's only like very lightly tied in with the joker
Sure. Yeah
Put it in that universe. I guess have some references there and I don't know what we're gonna do with it
This is the thing. I don't want to tell the man his business. He made a good movie
I give him full credit to see if he can do it again, and I hope he can if he does
Anyway
Not censoring joker, what is he thinking?
Yeah, I know some people actually write the weird joker without censoring it like as if we haven't had to deal with enough today
like jeez
Quite the dog down right insensitive
I've seen that a good half a dozen times now. That's crazy that people censor joker
Well, I think that has word
Yeah, really, but I think that has to do with the censored words on youtube that list that we read
And joker's on there. So I have to imagine they're trying to keep the monetization
Huh, these are no tweets. Well now I just don't fucking know. Yeah, that's what you can monetize tweets
Then I need to get back
I feel like we're gonna introduce both facebook and twitter. We're supposed to be introducing some kind of monetization thing
I don't know how that would work. I know facebook was. Imagine putting ads on tweets
Oh, jesus christ, it's bad enough. You know, right
That actually feels like that'll happen. Honestly thinking about it. Like you can view this tweet in five seconds like oh
You know, what's funny though is like some people will have embedded videos and their ads on it before the video starts
So we're kind of already there. Yeah, that's probably what what it is. Yeah
Yeah
um
Anyway, uh, isn't palpatine's deal is that no one can break free from the dark side
Uh tlg defenders love arrogance, but this is the one time i'd use that argument against the sequels
No one can break free from the dark side
Vader did
Yeah, I was gonna say whether or not palpatine thinks that we know it's not true. I guess. Yeah, we have an example
Uh efab bad i've never watched it and I don't watch it, but I know it's bad because longman bad ps. Hi wags
Yeah, that's fair enough. Hello. Hello. Hi there and
Jay longbone wolfie and meow
Hello
You know, I have a bone wags
Oh, thank you
Only clowns can say the jay word with a heart
Only clowns can say the jay word
uh
like cloud is like a
very serious label
Are you a cloud prove it?
Usually you have to squeeze your nose and it goes that you're like, okay good
That's the test honk honk
um
Could you do episode nine efab in a special way?
We have multiple guests changing like in 50 all talking about how they love the movie
I mean, we'll do one free episode nine
But I don't think we're going to be doing anything specifically special for it outside of just talking about that shit, you know
Yeah, I can't imagine we'll do another 24 7 1 or 24 7 fucking hell
Oh gee for seven
That'll be the most experimental
You heard about the 24 hour efap 24 7 efap
That'll be efap episode 1000
And it'll be that I literally sleep in alternating like
12 hour portions, you know, like we start upstream then I go to sleep and you guys have to carry it
Or we all just go to bed and we leave it on for eight hours and nobody's talking. We let anybody
Come in and go out let their leisure
We fucking leave the invite open and just people from chat pour it like I want to comment on the video
Oh
Drunken peasants is in chat. Hello there
Hello there. Yes, it is eight hours, but in fairness
How long have we been doing super chats now? Is it two hours?
Yeah
We started six and a half hours, right? Was it? Yeah, that's about right
So, yeah, we've been doing super chats for two hours. Okay, so it's not a crazy long stream
It's it's your average standard normal six hour stream. Everyone has those this has average
Uh, here's a free super chat. Our average is above average
rags
Hello destiny two is free on steam ever. Oh
That's that ends with a full stop. I don't know
Do you care about that?
Destiny two is destiny two is free on steam full stop. There's there's more to it, but it's not oh, I thought there
Oh, okay. I thought there was more I was waiting for the more of it
I I'm aware that it is on steam. Yes
No, there you go
I'm too old. I don't really have much
Yeah, I don't really have an interest and
Kind of just I don't care about destiny two
Maybe i've heard it's gotten better, but yeah, I guess i'm just not interested enough to delve back in. Mm-hmm
I'm happy for those who like destiny too because it looks like it's gotten better ever since uh
Bungie went their own way. So cool. Yeah
And then it follows up with ever watch hippo zone
Hippo zone
I'm gonna guess no for all three of us
And then it ends with you and I will poop on the same seat at the same time looking in each other's eyes
Can three people fit on the same I think they mean specifically you
Do you and them yeah
The two of us so well still
I guess that makes things slightly more doable, but it's a it's a big seat. I guess you can fit two butts on there
Can be kind of awkward, but I mean rags are you refusing this offer
I i'd rather
No, I I I don't think I will uh join you
All right mutual poo
Well, this this this no I want to poop alone and with no one else around me
Also with the door closed
Yeah, I am that's that's denial right there. He is denied. I'm gonna i'm i'm gonna deny the the this
poochuol with you
poochuol
Sup beaches love y'all why thank you for the kind? Oh, hello, bitch
This is money. It can be exchanged against goods and services also. Hi rex
Oh, hey
Please do an efap where batman eats toothpaste
What
Oh, so do we just reenact that does he have like bad teeth or covering a
Episode of some series or a movie where he does this. I don't know
Is this maybe this is some kind of like one parody thing
Is it
with like toothpaste and batman
Yeah, why not?
He sticks a tube of toothpaste up his batman. Even if you're doing porn it's good to have clean teeth
He's referring to eating it and it's very specific fetish, but don't judge I guess
Okay, good stuff
Uh, you should cover robot heads review of mandalorian. They have him come in wait. Sorry then have him come in to talk about it afterwards
well
Well funny you should say that
He definitely had a hot take.
He got like 50% like dislike on his video.
And that's Robot Head.
He's a crowd pleaser in terms of like,
people like him a lot.
So it must have said something.
Also Hi Rags.
Hello.
Hello all my Edwards.
Hello.
Hello.
Hippo man bad.
I cannot confirm if that is true,
but it sounds agreeable.
I will say that.
Swore PSA sitch or ditch
called Murdoch alt-right propaganda.
Who's Murdoch?
I don't know who that was.
Did he say sitch called somebody this?
It says PSA ditch, but I assume they mean sitch.
Well, if S becomes D, what becomes M?
Maybe it's not Murdoch.
Maybe it's Lurdock.
Oh, Lurdock's an asshole.
Yeah, I agree.
Alt-right propaganda.
Lurdock.
Fucking Lurdock.
I don't know.
I don't actually know who you're referring to in this tweet.
No, I'm afraid I don't either.
Rags is the Don confirmed.
Oh, I don't want to.
I don't want to fill those shoes.
Yeah, those are hard shoes to fill, man.
That smile can't be beat, cannot be replicated.
Well,
how am I alt-right leftist Nazi communists today?
We are great comrade.
Doing good.
Yeah, I mean, it seems
contradictory to sort of people.
It's not, though.
It's not.
You can hold views that contradict each other
at the same time.
You just have to sort of not think about it.
That's all.
Um.
Rags makes my peepee up.
Ooh.
Also, hi, Wags.
Hello.
Rags was a Bosso Zoku rider,
now confirmed in law.
Bosso Zoku?
I don't know.
Oh, isn't that one of the names of the stamps?
One of the stamps.
Yeah, you know those little doggo stamps
that YouTube lets you put up?
I think one of the stamps.
So, Bosso Zoku is a Japanese youth subculture
associated with customized motorcycles.
See, and he knew that off the top of his head
because he's definitely that.
Yeah, I knew that off the top of my head.
I definitely didn't.
Here, I couldn't have Googled it
because I don't know how to spell it.
Yeah, well, shit.
So, there you go.
It's proof.
Dude knows our Wags better than we do, apparently.
Yeah, we need to work on it.
Interesting, I didn't know that.
I didn't know that.
Incoming weird vomit, buckle up, buckaroos.
Buckle up, buckaroos.
That was weird vomit if we're referring to movie.
Oh, yes, yes.
The alien they meet with at the beginning of TROS
is called Booleo, according to the latest leaks.
Also, Snoke was just a pawn as well.
Oh, of course he was.
Ah, Booleo.
The...
Oh, no.
I don't know how much they'll probably keep telling us.
Snoke doesn't matter.
And it's like, guys, you told us he matters.
Stop saying he doesn't matter.
He clearly fucking mattered.
Like, the idea that they're like,
he's just a powerful guy who, you know,
resurrected the Empire.
You're like, stop saying that.
He's just a powerful guy who resurrected the Empire.
It's an extremely powerful force user
who fucking trained Kylo Ren
and caused the downfall of Luke Skywalker
and created the First Order.
What?
Important.
Been too long since I caught a livestream
with Star Wars Girl.
Also, hello, all good to make it.
Hello, all good to make it.
Oh, hello, all good to make it.
Good to make it.
Hello.
Nailed it. Of course.
Hello, fellow humans and rags.
Random question.
What kind of audio setup do you have?
Microphone, mixer, interface?
Voice sounds really clean.
Love from Finland.
I just used an AT2020 USB
and it just plugs into the computer.
And that's all I'm using.
I don't have a mixer or anything like that.
That might be my next step to the next thing to kind of get.
But right now it's just a mic plugged right
into the back of the PC.
I have an AT2020 XLR
and it goes into a Behringer mixer that's quite small.
It's a compact one because I don't need a lot of options
when I'm controlling everything up here.
It does everything I need it to.
And then that goes into the PC.
We're on similar setups.
I know that Wolf has a similar setup.
I believe Forteer and Metal have the exact same setup I do
and Smiler Alders.
And I have an AT2020 USB as well.
I have a pop filter too.
Dun, dun, dun.
I don't know if that counts but that's there.
And my schnozberries taste like schnozberries.
Mm.
Kick rags also, hi, Mola.
Hello.
Hey.
They said kick you rags.
Kick me?
Mm-hmm.
You gotta make an oof.
You gotta make a big old wolf sound.
Angry wolf.
An angry wolf sound?
I don't know if I've ever done that.
I guess it would be a growl.
I don't know.
No, I don't know if I've got it in me.
I'm not really, I'm not that, I'm not that angry.
It's okay.
It's just, it's just a meme.
Can't be angry at a meme.
You can handle it.
Movie Bob, I'd rather floss out my urinary tract
with salt encrusted bobbed wire
than listen to one more of that massive orphan's
page-long sentences again.
Salt encrusted barbed wire.
Oh my God, I actually felt it.
Yeah.
Salt encrusted barbed wire.
To be fair, that's a, that's a candy and effort.
But yeah, that, there's no fucking way I would go for that
instead of listening to one page-long sentence
from Movie Bob.
I just have different preferences.
I know, everyone is subjective, I know.
But yeah, that's, you know.
Have you seen Sargon of Akkad's video
on the politics of Starship Troopers?
I don't normally watch him, but it's the best video
on Starship Troopers on YouTube.
I mean, I really wanted, I've said this before,
I really want him to discuss Starship Troopers
with Red Letter Media, and it's never gonna happen,
but the takes are so different.
And I wanna see what happens on which side
would reconcile information or not.
You know what I mean?
I don't know if it would come to an impasse or something,
but yes, I quite enjoyed his video on Starship Troopers.
I find it all very interesting.
The discussion on Starship Troopers as a whole.
I mean, we get to look at women.
That's true.
That's true.
That's Star Wars echoes.
What good's a woman if you can't look at her?
Yeah.
Yeah, there was a bit of Star Wars girl echoing throughout,
but I think we nailed most of it.
It's fine, it's all right, it's all right.
Moolman, the channel Astartis got hacked.
He makes super high quality animations
that you should check out.
I actually essentially have now,
because there was a meme video that was essentially that,
just with all of our faces on top of it.
So technically I've seen that Astartis video,
or at least that one, yeah.
There are only a minute each you should bring attention
to them and help get his channel back,
because he still not got it back.
I would assume it would have been solved.
How long has it been gone?
Let me check, because I know another,
I think Major Kill was another one
that kind of both Warhammer channels,
which is kind of weird, but let's see.
I mean, the channel name is still Kyo, about, yeah,
I don't know.
I hope that, yeah, I can't say, I assume that it is,
because it, because the channel name is different,
but nothing, like all the videos are there.
It doesn't look like any community posts have been made.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, there's,
the whole truth about the Astartis incident is in this post.
You fools once accused this guy that he steals the channels.
Channels are stolen by an organized group of hackers,
which of course you will never catch.
What do they do with hacked channels?
Correctly sell it.
Mr. Crazy is just one of those who legally bought
this channel.
By the way, if the real owner of this channel gets in touch,
then Mr. Crazy is ready to consider a deal with him.
This guy,
okay.
The whole channel's ransom.
What a disgusting piece of shit.
Who would do that?
What a terrible thing to do to somebody.
Wow.
Well, remember, Rags, there are no bad tactics
or any bad people to throw them at.
Bad targets.
Movie ball would approve of that
as long as you do it to the right people.
Oh, man.
Some people are just fucking disgusting.
Little bit, yeah.
Um, I don't think you read my last super chat, massive.
Why do people do this to me?
Like, if,
look,
if ever I don't read the chat,
don't set another one to say, go read it.
Just say what you said.
Now I gotta figure out if this is from,
because I haven't missed any from today or the other day.
And I, you don't understand how many pages
I've got to load and control F just to find if,
and then I don't even know if it's the right one or not.
It just, just,
it's,
just next time, if I miss it,
if I miss a super chat for any reason,
and maybe it was blocked, maybe it was retracted.
There's a couple of those that get that treatment.
And obviously I just don't read them out because,
you know, there's nothing to read,
but just throw in the thing in the thing
and then I can read it out.
Mueller, I'll eventually get you to say the n-word,
maybe not today, or even next DFAT, but mark my words.
I will you,
oh, nougah.
Yeah, you're not gonna get me with that one.
Also, women bad, please go home.
What?
I can't, I can't wait until the lore expands
and Mueller says the n-word.
I mean, I gotta get permission off C-3PO.
Who's gonna, yeah, are you gonna say it first or C-3PO?
I love that beaver, he's staring at it on the knife
and sweating.
Yeah, those Sith, they were evil.
Anna Baby Yoda Squeal.
Yeah, she's really into Baby Yoda.
I think that's fair.
Also, yeah, we got another episode coming today, I believe.
Oh.
Should be out in like 10 hours or so, I think.
Very nifty.
Another episode of Batwoman or?
Mandalorian.
Yes.
No, actually, Batwoman's not out now
until December 1st ranks.
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry.
I thought it was on hiatus.
Another week.
Also, Jay Longo said she won't be covering
Crisis on Infinite Earths.
And I was like, fuck that, we're covering it.
Yeah, boy, we're not gonna know what the hell's going on
and nothing will seem any different.
And if it's, if it leaves on a cliffhanger
and we find out that you have to watch like episode,
whatever of Superwoman to know what happens to Batwoman,
there's a good chance we might even do it.
We gotta keep in continuity
with our favorite character, Batwoman.
Otherwise, what the fuck are we?
Let's be honest.
What if it makes more sense than any of the other shows
or any of the other episodes?
I mean, maybe it will, I don't know.
It's gonna be exciting.
Maybe it will.
Death is the sequel to life only if you see it.
I think that should have ended with
if you interpret it that way.
Yeah, I think so.
I get the message though.
Efap interrupted me when I was actually fapping.
Aw.
I mean, it should only encourage, I think.
You should be fine.
First super chat, sub-massives.
Ever read the Republic Commando books?
No, I'm afraid.
No, I have not.
D plus should do a live or animated series
on those under the Legends banner.
Use the books as a screenplay, target it at adults.
I mean, there's nothing they can't do, really.
Oh, Disney plus.
We'll have to see, yeah.
And adult Star Wars, like a porno?
I mean, why not?
Go for it, Disney plus, do it.
Yeah.
Do all of the things.
You never know what'll work.
Can we outlaw the accent?
I can't stand Morley Blob.
I don't think you can outlaw the Boston accent.
The Boston accent is not outlawable, I'm afraid.
Boston?
Yeah, Morley Blob though.
Morley Blob, Morley Blob, Morley Blob.
Wolf, Rey is better character
than anyone from Lord of the Rings.
Change my mind, XD.
JK, I love Lord of the Rings.
Just want your reaction.
I'm about to say, I think you'd change it
with a golf club.
He'll be upset by that, but I'll try
and read it out for him the next time he's here.
Like I said, I've got all these questions.
Look at this one.
Gary, say baby girl is a naughty girl.
That's for dude Rotic, whenever he comes back on here.
Do you know how awkward that's gonna be?
Gary, the super chat requires it.
With all the people who watch Star Wars and all that,
there is at least one person who thinks
that Rey is a better character
than anyone in the Lord of the Rings.
There's someone out there who believes that.
Law of, what is it, Poe's Law or Murphy's Law?
Whichever one means that if it can, it will.
Poe Dameron's Law?
No, no, if it can happen.
Poe's Law is that just because,
if a woman tells you that you were wrong,
this confirmation you were right all along,
it's Poe's Law.
I think it's Murphy's Law.
Murphy's Law is anything that can go wrong with.
You mean like Law of Averages or?
Anything that can go, oh you're right, it will go wrong.
I mean, we could apply Murphy's Law to that
because that would be something going wrong.
Law of numbers.
No, I just mean, if someone concluded
that Rey was better than every character in Lord of the Rings,
that would be an example of something going wrong.
That would be going wrong.
But I don't think that's how people really use Murphy's Law.
You really impressed Raw with that golf club thing,
that's bullshit.
Golf club thing?
Yeah, I was saying like somebody said Rey
is a better character than all the Lord of the Rings
characters changed my mind, I said well,
Wolf would probably want to do that with a golf club.
True.
He's in a golf club?
No, he hit the guy with a golf club.
No, he hit the guy with a golf club
until his mind was changed about Rey
being better than Lord of the Rings characters.
Oh, yeah.
So this one just says, he would just become
Jenny at the foot of the snow.
Jenny at the foot of the snow?
Yeah, I'm not sure what to make of that.
These out of context efap comments,
I don't know what to say.
S-N-O-W?
Mm-hmm.
I don't know, maybe it's snowing where Jenny lives
and he's letting us know.
I have no idea what that means.
The Twitter mob are gonna call you guys red-pilled
racist, sexist for talking about something
other than the video, you utter massives.
I was just saying, if Movie Bob tweets this stream out,
who's gonna give a shit and be like,
oh, they talked about me for about two?
We're not gonna care.
We're just not gonna give a shit.
No.
Just not gonna give a shit.
Finally started reading A Game of Thrones
for the first time, didn't see the show
but know all the spoilers, 300 PG in,
full pages in, good so far and grateful
the chapters are short.
I hope you enjoy it, have fun.
Yeah, wasn't that a meme where people who read the book
could tell the red wedding was coming
and people who watched the show, you could tell
they didn't read the books.
And then there was like subreddits discussing
the show from a book perspective
and then the book people eventually were like,
yeah, we don't even know the cheats anymore.
This is gonna be great, everything's new now.
And look how that turned out.
It's gonna be fun.
It wasn't.
Spoilers.
It was a fucking disaster, it was.
Diabeto is an Avengers level threat for certain.
Yep.
I hope they take him seriously, man.
It's gonna be a really good movie when it comes out.
I am personally looking very much forward to it.
Did you see how many donuts he can float, dude?
It's fucking over, dude.
Remember that piece of art
with all those people he's floating?
Like that's like a hundred people or some shit.
It's pretty impressive.
Yeah, I'm girthy too.
The power itself, I mean.
All right, whoa, two women to look at?
Someone called Major Lee.
Oh.
I can't believe Major Lee refused to debate
Geeks and Gamers, man.
That would've been.
He did?
Yeah, like they do this thing called Common Ground.
Now, I think there's two episodes of it,
but I think they wanna do more,
where Jeremy will allow the people who hate him the most
to come and talk to him personally through Ryan.
Like he contacts and get it all sorted out.
And apparently they invited Major Lee and he refused.
When was this?
What were they gonna talk about?
Well, the fact that Major Lee made a video
on the fandom menace, right?
So I think that they were gonna talk about that, I guess.
I don't really know.
Oh, I see.
I just went to his channel really quick.
Okay.
But yeah, I just find it kind of amusing
that like I would've thought he'd want to, you know?
Bob tweeted an hour ago in response
to someone telling him he was being roasted.
Really?
Let's have a look, C.
Oh my goodness, imagine how long it would take
to roast someone of his size.
How could you say such a thing?
Inside would always be fucking raw.
Well, that's fucking true, that is.
Let's see, two hours ago.
That's probably too late.
Where's the Bob sauce?
I'm actually looking for the Bob sauce.
Red pill alt-right in cell Nazi misogyny podcast
of the women hating division.
My goodness.
Oh, 13 hours, I've gone too far.
No, no.
Oh, I just saw somebody saying that feel
when you were definitely not into eugenics.
I guess the tweet is, I prefer to simply see it
in terms of natural selection in the new era
of intellectual slash creative fitness.
That's what Bob Schimann said.
And he said, natural selection is the opposite of eugenics.
You can't get more opposite than we should manipulate
breeding in order to control population development
than natural selection.
I even invoked both Nazis and present day Nazi sympathizers
on the other side to clarify this.
Bob, you're not escaping the fucking comments
you've made previously.
Good luck with that shit.
Your vile hatred has brought you full circle.
Well, I mean, you wouldn't think.
It's funny because he's round.
You wouldn't think he ever thought you would escape it.
He would have thought the way he hit said all that shit
that he'd be like, well, yeah.
He's like, oh, maybe I shouldn't defend eugenics.
What the greatest look at history.
He was like, no, I movie Bob, I cannot be wrong.
Yeah, maybe I'm missing it.
I'm just looking for a
Elon Musk.
All right, well, oh my God.
He's recently released merchandise for big picture.
Oh, that even be shirts come in sizes, extra, extra large.
It's just extra, extra, extra.
It's just the logo, the big picture on a t-shirt.
Why would anyone buy that?
So you can identify your fellow allies
when you're out in public comrades.
Yeah, so you can hate the pores together.
So someone said at the movie, Bob,
you're being roasted as a meme on Efep right now.
And he said, oh, that's nice.
I'm keeping a family member company overnight in hospital
while they recover from surgery.
So I suppose we all had important priorities this evening.
That doesn't work, Bob.
Yeah, that would, you would have to say
that we had something else to do in place of it.
And you can't guilt trip us
after the shit that you said on fucking public.
You can't get away with that shit.
Not gonna work.
Not gonna work.
You would have had seven billion chances
not to pull that card before.
In all seriousness, I hope the family member is okay,
but fuck movie, Bob.
He's a piece of shit.
He's also feeding orphans and collecting boulders.
Yeah, and besides, the memes were very positive.
We made him a super villain, but still super.
Yeah, it's odd he went it all along
to be a super person, an Uber minch.
And we gave him a really fantastic sleeping solution.
So he advocates for the genocide
of people who think differently.
And then he's like,
hey, I've got a family member in hospital.
You're like, what the fuck?
He's like, what the fuck?
Nice fucking try.
Those pesky Nazis gave you jettocks a bad name.
Oh no.
Anyway, Wilford Brimley is the real Diabeto.
I love Wilford Brimley's name because saying it,
well, sort of speak,
because who talks about Wilford Brimley?
Wilford Brimley.
I think a great name too.
Wilford Brimley.
We'll listen tomorrow.
Wait, sorry.
And the origin story.
The origin story is where Bob comes across Wilford Brimley
in like a cave somewhere,
training and medicating with the diabetes powers,
and he passes it along to the new generation.
Wilford taught him everything he needs to know.
We'll listen tomorrow,
as always, thanks for the content.
It makes working out in the cold a little bit easier.
Also for Anna, the warriors suck.
Oh my.
Oh my goodness.
The warriors?
Are they like a sports bowl team?
I don't know.
Or is that a TV show?
Yeah, maybe it's a TV show.
A movie?
How could I possibly know the outside of us?
Really suck.
Well, yeah.
I mean, you know, would a super chat lie?
I don't think so.
It sounds like the plot of Dracula Untold.
I'll tell you, Dracula Untold is a fucking masterpiece.
A masterpiece of cinema.
Movie Bob records.
All approves of its themes.
Movie Bob records the way he does
because it just takes whatever half sentences sound fine
and snap to previous everything.
He can get back to editing in two hours.
Oh, it's the laziest form of audio editing you can do.
If you notice as well,
he cuts himself off too early a lot of the time
on his videos.
His sentences, like the words,
like say, for example, that the word words,
you have that like, right at the end,
he'll cut the-
Cut it off in the S, in the S.
And he wouldn't fade it or anything.
So just cut.
And you're just like, oh.
Because they're just rough cuts.
I've always kind of been an advocate of people on YouTube,
really everywhere,
just kind of talking like they talk normally.
Not, you know, take out the pauses and the stutters
and, you know, misspeaks like that.
But in terms of your cadence and the way that you speak
and the pacing, that sort of thing,
just talk like you normally talk.
Putting on fake voices
or trying to artificially speed it up
or edit it to where you're cutting yourself off.
Don't cut yourself off.
That's dumb.
Don't edit.
Don't, don't go through extra trouble to cut off yourself.
They'll probably, like, they probably say like,
it's my style.
You'd be like, stop it.
You're styling shit.
Well, stop.
You have a shitty style.
I just agree with your style.
But if I slowed down,
they could understand what I'm trying to say.
Well, we can't have that
because then we would actually be able to understand
what he's saying and then we might have to respond.
Can't have that.
People are listening, not watching or paying attention.
Good enough.
Robot had put out tweets about that hair drying robot.
The one that's got a hair dryer face, whatever.
He's like, good luck becoming popular
with baby Yoda around.
Oh.
Yes, very true.
Anyway, I believe the condition movie blob
has is called diarrhea of the mouth.
Also high bags and wall off.
Hello.
Wall off would say hi.
Jay fucking long bone.
She's got very funny videos.
This is true.
Yes, she does.
Check them out.
It's great.
It's fantastic.
Diabeto's one weakness is insulin.
Yes, as the meme pointed out, doctor.
I forget what it was called.
The one that rags didn't laugh at.
Doctor.
Yeah, it was the insulin meme.
No, doctor.
And.
Anselin.
Yeah.
And ceiling or something.
Well, finally, find me a pack of degenerates
and send them all to my rooftops because it's EFAP time.
Glad this will keep me up all night
and turn my sleep cycle nocturnal again.
The other way around just doesn't suit me.
Apparently Ras nocturnal.
Why would a sun god be nocturnal?
I was about to say.
It's sun for the people on the other side of the planet.
Does it?
Oh, okay.
Why would he be nocturnal?
Why would he sleep?
Well, while the sun's gone, I mean, you might as well sleep.
I mean, the sun's up.
You got stuff to do.
You're the sun god.
But if the sun's away, you're sleeping.
You're resting.
And when you get up, you'll bring it back again.
You know what nocturnal means, right?
It's the opposite of that.
Say what?
What are we talking about?
If Ras nocturnal, he doesn't sleep at night.
He's awake at night if he's nocturnal.
The sun's all it's going to be up on the other side of the planet.
So he's sort of nocturnal because it might be dark for them.
But for us, you know, hey, we got sun.
They got sun.
We got sun, you know.
I completely agree.
No, just a little bit between us and the sun.
That's the issue.
Yeah, but when he says he's going to be nocturnal,
that means he's going to be awake during the dark,
which means he's not going to be on the other side of the planet.
Where the sun is.
His dark.
His his dark.
Is he sleeping during his dark?
That's fine.
He's not going to be awake.
Well, he's got shit to do.
He's got a sun god.
Drive across the sky.
Right, you know, making sense.
Yeah, but no, I am.
No, fuck you.
No, fuck you.
I'm making sense.
I'm making sense.
We'll leave it to chat to vote.
Did rags make sense?
One for yes, two for no.
Obviously, one is the number of the count and the number of the count shall be one.
I feel like we need to bookmark straw poll.
Bookmark straw poll.
I feel like it will be a landslide.
Literally all decisions will be settled by popularity.
Absolutely.
And the stars are like suns.
So now what?
Can't see all the other suns if the big suns out.
I don't think that's how that works.
You're a god.
You think the sun god is going to be blinded or hindered by his own sun?
Perposterous.
Are you saying his son can't blind a sun god?
Is that shitty of a sun?
No.
I'm saying he's better than his own creation.
I'm seeing.
You can't blind him.
In way more two than one.
It's almost explicitly ones.
It's actually almost all ones.
Does that mean?
In fact, I haven't seen a two yet.
The twos have it.
Very interesting.
The twos definitely don't.
I haven't even seen a two yet.
This makes total sense if you can if you remember that the sun god, right, he's got to be he
needs to sleep while the sun somewhere else.
Sun doesn't go away.
Doesn't disappear.
Yeah, but you're a strange man, then he wouldn't oh, man, man, got to sleep.
Oh, this is an interesting one for me to read out.
My name is mauler and I love TLJ.
The themes are great and I really enjoyed what they did to Luke's character.
Don't listen to me if I say otherwise.
Amen.
Don't know what that means.
Anyway, hey, I'm a long time viewing before he started seeing all the memes grow and stuff
has been great.
Thanks for offering hours of distractions from my horrible self doubt and loneliness.
Oh, oh, oh, happy to do that for you.
Glad you enjoy the memes.
Yeah, I mean, it's really great.
We have the best means, though.
We only we only facilitate the memes pop memes.
We don't like it.
Create the memes.
Yeah.
We kickstart memes.
We just provide the clown and then they provide the talent.
Wolf, you're working on writing a new book, right?
Good luck, my dude.
I'm writing my Facebook and it's been such a journey.
Also, hi, Rags.
Hello. He is working on his new book.
Yeah, he's working away on it and he's also working on YouTube videos as far as I'm
aware.
Cool. So when you make it sound like he's written books before.
Yes, he did.
Iridescent was his first book, I believe.
I didn't know that.
That's cool. It is no longer perchaseable,
but it did exist at one point.
Hmm.
The law of Yuki had a fat boy with the power to change sugar into electricity.
Oh.
We have a new we have a new diabetes based economy.
Yeah.
I mean, people in champion like you're like nine hours behind on Super Chat.
Guys, I'm aware of this.
What do you want me to do?
Nine hours?
Well, I mean, they're being hyperbolic because this stream just hit nine hours.
So it's pretty impossible for that to be the case.
But, you know, it's fine.
It's fine.
Well, we're doing what we can is insulin, diabetes, kryptonite.
Yes.
There's some not even know.
No, get it away.
This is why we don't get all the videos every 10 months.
No, it's not.
More stuff on the way.
OK, I used to watch movie, Bob, but the constant virtue signaling combined
with pretentious rambling wore me down.
What exactly was the appeal?
That's like what was the part that was like, well, there's this, you know,
hang around for some reason.
Well, he's he's talking like this is something
like I remember him being pretty awful early on.
He didn't do the virtue signaling quite as bad, but his takes were really terrible.
There was like he was talking about one movie and saying how it was
totally fine because it was camp, even though the whole thing was garbage.
And then another movie, he said it was garbage and he didn't use the camp
excuse, and it's kind of seemed like he was favoring one movie genre
and giving it the gift of the camp tag to completely dismiss how terrible it was.
And wait a minute.
Are you saying that he was inconsistent?
I think I am.
Was he handing out the camp tag like people hand out theme tags?
Oh, my God.
Kind of. Yeah. Yeah, he kind of seemed like it. Hmm.
But then the virtue signaling happened and it just got worse.
Oh, no. Yeah.
Isn't it isn't it crazy that you were on our stream with Onision last year?
That is crazy. Oh, yeah, that is crazy.
Yeah. Didn't you like totally dig into what you see on?
Well, you're right. Yeah.
Yeah. He's a piece of shit.
And you just took the opportunity.
You also you also didn't let the opportunity go down to dig into Monday.
But to let anyone get away with anything.
No, that chick was there.
That chick. No, but he's nice.
It's like, what the fuck do you mean?
Oh, Monday, man, he's nice.
No, he actually kind of sounds like a prick.
He's well, what he did wasn't very nice.
I think we can all agree on that.
What he did was a terrible thing.
Let's see. Let's check out his YouTube channel.
See how he's see how he's doing.
Yeah, it's legit.
Let's raw. It can't be nine hours.
I started streaming nine hours and three minutes ago.
And I've already read like a lot of Efap 61 chats.
It can't be nine hours ago.
It might be like the best you'll ever be is like eight and a half or something,
but it can't be nine.
Do you have a ballpark for what we have left?
Do you really want to know?
So it says here that Matt Jarbo's last video two days ago.
Death Stranding should be disqualified from the game awards.
But OK, why?
Is it because it came out too late?
He says, let's see.
I take ethical issues with just how many nominations
Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding has received.
Let's see.
Joff Kaley, and now who announced the nominees and Kojima have been BFFs for years.
And while Joff claims, he says he has no say in the nomination process.
The advisory board picks the gaming journalist outlets that will choose
which games get nominated.
It feels like a massive conflict of interest and one that would have been
a highlight, a high profile controversy during the height of GamerGate 2014.
So, yeah, Matt thinks that
Death Stranding should be disqualified from the game awards.
It should not be able to win anything, I guess.
And he's basing this off of like influencers, like maybe being biased or something.
Here's based on what I wrote out.
Yeah, so I don't know.
Oh, my goodness.
He talked about Donald Trump, Jr.
floundering on The View.
That's a low score, even for Matt.
Two weeks ago, he did an orange man's son bad.
He he sided with The View.
Well, then he made you say low scores is down votes high.
Yeah, he's got two orange man bads in the last in his last little thing.
Wow, he's a can't believe he's still doing this.
Ra is like, oh, it's eight point five hours, not nine.
Oh, OK. That's all I was trying to say.
You said it was nine hours when the stream had only barely hit nine hours.
It's not physically possible.
That's what I was trying to say.
I don't fucking know what specific type it is.
These aren't time stabbed.
But yeah, you got to remember, by the way,
there's more super chat at the beginning than there are as the stream goes on.
Right. So it's like it's not like if it took half an hour
to read the first selection or whatever, the every selection runs away.
You know, it's always different.
It takes you different times.
But we'll get there.
Diabito's parents died in the Jellicost.
Oh, the Jellicost. Yeah.
Took many lives.
Matt told us that his favorite Indiana Jones movie is Temple of Doom,
but his favorite movie is The Lost Crusade.
What?
His favorite movie is The Lost Crusade,
but his favorite Indiana Jones movie is Temple of Doom.
Doesn't make any sense. All right.
Just think.
Sure, he stopped that out very well.
Yeah.
And howdy, Muge Lord.
Hello. Hi, Ragolds.
Hello, Wolfseff.
I'm sure you would say hi.
I started reading the Witcher books, but I'm kind of confused by the order.
Does the last wish come before blood of elves?
Mallsboob, watch the last day, Bender.
I am. I'm set to do that. It'll happen.
And as for the question about the Witcher books, just Google it.
There's got to be people who would answer that.
Like, Wolf might be able to answer it, but obviously he's not here.
But I don't know.
Google shall have the answer.
I do not know the answer to your question.
I'm sure somebody has said the same thing, so you'll find it.
Did anyone did anyone say Catman yet?
I don't know.
Do they? I don't think so.
Catman. You, Catman.
Have we seen Catman?
No, I've not.
Catman do.
I'm all I've been watching Buffy, and I got to say it sucks
because Angel is clearly an Edward Cullen ripoff.
Fucking Angel was made before Twilight was written.
Also, Xander is a lesbian, but that's not possible.
There's there's restrictions in place that would prevent that.
No joke, you really did. It's on the video.
Did you did you call Matt out on that?
Did you be like, hey, Matt, this doesn't quite make sense?
I don't know. Yeah, like that.
I don't know. Some here, some here, I write.
I feel like you don't know.
Two women on Efap?
Seems like I got some looking to do.
Yes, yes, indeed.
Follow the teachings of Mr.
Lee. You guys should read Movie Bob's book.
That's a lot of things in a movie. Bob has a book.
Oh, I almost forgot he does have a book.
Yeah, it was something about like being the best at YouTube or some shit.
It was pretty bad.
Yeah, it was something about being a being a celebrity on YouTube,
something along those lines.
I don't have the exact title, but that's what it was about in essence.
I have a free one. It's yours now.
Thank you.
I'm so glad I'm not the only one who loves Scooby Doo and Zombie Island.
Loved that movie as far as I was aware.
A lot of people like Scooby Doo and Zombie Island.
It's really good. It's my favorite of them all.
I remember being my favorite.
Billy destroyed him after he said that.
Yeah, that seems like it makes sense for Matt.
Oh, man. Let the rhino milk consume you also. Hi, Rags.
OK. Wonder if Movie Bob appreciates in his tweet
while he he's a white dude talking about how the future he is owed
being stolen from him and the class of people he holds responsible.
Horseshoe theory for the win.
I don't even movie Bob at this point.
I don't even know what specifically like politically almost seems like
he's on his own in his own world.
A lot of the statements he makes, like I just feel like the left
would just be like, dude, dude, how do we don't say that shit? OK.
Scooby Doo and Zombie Island was what killed the core premise of Scooby Doo.
I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that.
Do you mean like it changed up the formula?
Yeah, say that one more time.
Scooby Doo and Zombie Island was what killed the core premise of Scooby Doo.
Oh. I'm I OK.
Well, it made a new premise that was amazing.
Maybe they're just referring to the fact that the monsters were real.
I mean, is it the fact that it's like a different formula in that?
Is this like a movie, right?
Yeah, it was a movie. Yeah, absolutely.
It was not like an episode.
Because I remember it, I guess, yeah, it just it changes up
how Scooby Doo works as a formula, I guess.
Maybe what maybe his takeaway is monsters are actually real,
so they could be real later.
And that kind of bugs him. Maybe. Yeah.
I thought the whole point of Scooby Doo is that
all that people are the real monsters.
Yeah. And I think when they become actual zombies,
that they can't pull a mask off of the zombies.
According to according to chat, there's earlier examples of real monsters.
Yeah. Oh, in the show.
So maybe it was like the structure of how the episode plays out.
I don't know. I really liked the Scooby Doo and in Zombie Island.
And I don't know about the I don't I don't have too much
care and investment in the Scooby Doo formula, you know.
Well, then.
That was great.
Also, Rags, love your TLJ review.
Well, thank you.
When will TFA be done?
It will be done next week.
I thought it was August 2020 for the next part.
We talked it. Yeah.
Oh, there you go.
A great next week in August, a great Todd Phillips movie is due date
with Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis.
They go on a car trip across the country to see Robert's kid's birth.
I've seen it. I found it pretty funny.
It's like having Tony Stark stuck
in like a buddy cop movie with a fucking annoying idiot.
And oh, oh, is this it sounds like a remake of Planes, Trains and Automobiles.
Kind of.
It's definitely its own thing.
It's just that I find it pretty amazing.
And yeah, I guess Todd Phillips made it.
All right. I haven't seen it in a while, though.
Also, thank you, DP.
I hated Scrappy as well.
Kill that little dog, just kill that little dog.
Peek meme hood, the hex girls are part of the law.
Oh, we're just discussing the hex girls.
Oh, no, like sex girls.
So who? Wait, who are the hex girls again?
Where are they from? God.
I was asking. I explained it again.
OK, that's all.
Sorry to. I don't I don't actually care enough to to put you through.
The hex girls are OK.
Well, the hex girls, they're a band of three young ladies named Thorn,
Dusk and Luna, and they appeared in Scooby Doo and the witch's ghost.
They're banned of a hex girl.
So they're going to put a spell on you.
Gotcha. Because I heard somebody asking who which one you'd bang.
And I'm like, I don't even know these people.
Thorn. Thorn is the correct answer.
Thorn is the correct answer.
Was that the guy with the black hair?
Yes. OK.
Is Rags Efap Scooby Doo?
Uh, I don't know.
Oh, well, there you go.
That is that.
I don't think I could eat that much.
Uh, all right, let me talk.
Yeah, get some of your get some of the devil's lettuce in you.
Get that racially charged.
Oh, yes, you're you're the you're the you're the dog.
I guess you're Scooby Doo, the group.
Boo Brothers is peak Scooby Rags.
You are scrappy.
Oof. Wait, what?
Honey Boo Brothers is peak Scooby and Rags is scrappy.
I am not scrappy.
Take that back, you piece of shit.
It's the worst thing you can call the guy.
I was going to say, that's that's quite a personal insult right there.
That goes right to the heart.
Yeah, how about you go turn around and smoke that on the way to the bank?
Nailed it. A short peer.
Yeah.
I remember the Scooby Doo movie where Shaggy turns into a werewolf
and he has to a Mad Max style race with other monsters in order to turn normal.
That sounds like the plot of a Scooby Doo movie.
Yeah, yeah.
Sure. One of the old crazy ones like the the whole Scooby Doo
where he has to take care of all the little monster babies.
He's like a teacher at a spooky school.
Oh, cool school, isn't it?
School school.
I think that's school school.
I don't I don't feel like Shaggy has like teaching credentials.
Well, that's because you're very racist and you think white people can't teach.
Shaggy's white. Mm hmm.
Oh, oh, let me look up Shaggy's last name.
By the way, where do those fuckers live anywhere or do they just live in the van?
I don't know.
Nobody knows.
Because it seems like they're always going somewhere
and then they stop at the mystery on the way to wherever they are going.
Where are they going?
So the real name of Shaggy is Norville Rogers.
Oh, oh, Norville Rogers.
You guys remember Scooby Dumb?
Yes, no.
Also, the movie was Scooby Doo and the Reluctant werewolf
for that one you were talking about, Rags.
The Reluctant werewolf.
Mm hmm.
Oh, apparently there's the Scooby D.
He's like.
Who is a it's a Scooby D is Scooby Doo's movie star cousin.
When Scooby D was remaking a film, maybe a long dead screen star, Milo Booth,
it seemed that Booth came back to life to put it into it.
It's a she it's a she's a she's a movie star.
I remember I like you got the Scooby Pedia and it tells you all about these
characters personality Scooby D is very sweet and kind and that's it Scooby
Pedia Scooby Pedia.
Yeah, you got to look if the fan base exists, they will.
No kidding.
There's a Scooby Pedia Scooby Pedia.
That's amazing.
I'm glad the Scooby Doo fan base have that.
We've been worshipping Ron his rooftop all these months, but we'll look really
silly if this whole time he's been living in a bungalow.
I mean, if you threw someone off a bungalow roof, it would still hurt like hell.
Probably wouldn't kill him, though.
Maybe that's the reveal.
Rod never wanted to kill anybody.
Just wanted to hit them.
Send them a message.
That's sort of a mob style, even though they also kill people a lot.
But seriously, really enjoying it.
But given the amount of vampire attacks and their lack of discretion, the fact
that all of Sunnydale is still oblivious to the least believable thing about the
show, they do address that a couple of times.
The people are more aware than we think.
And the the bigger question is why don't people why when the government stepped in?
But then that also gets an answer.
In fairness, there are there are addresses for that.
So, you know, they try.
They don't the wheel building needs a lot of work in Buffy, though.
If a male orphan has a child thus gaining dad strength, do they risk breaking their
own bones due to also having low bone density?
Oh, my.
It's a tough question.
Dad, strength, negative bone density carry the one.
This isn't a black hole bones.
I don't know if we have made them black holes.
Well, I guess that wouldn't be negative density.
That would be like super density would create an orphan black hole.
Jay Longbone is racist.
I convened with the Council of Color and they agree with me.
The Council Council of Color.
She would have appreciated that.
That's great borrowing that his origin story is that he went to a candy named
our sweets or sweets.
His parents fell deep because Friar because he bumped into them, then developed his powers.
I think this is supposed to be about.
Diabeto, so his origin story is that he went to a candy.
He went to a candy named our sweets.
I think that's what we candy store.
I don't know his parents fell into in the deep.
In the deep, just as in the deep because Friar.
The deep fat in the deep because Friar Friar, the deep because
see you said like as if to say because, you know, in the deep because Friar, because he
bumped into them, then developed his powers.
So he accidentally pushed his parents into the deep Friar for sweets and they died, I
guess, and then he became powerful.
I can believe that movie Bob accidentally bumped into somebody else in a small confined
space.
Yes.
I don't know why I don't I don't know what a deep fat Friar was doing at a candy store.
I'm just curious how the death of his parents provided him powers.
I don't see how that works.
Were they caramelized alive?
Deep Friar.
How does he gain the powers?
That's the really important element to this.
Like I don't understand.
This is just a tragedy.
Like, how do we know if you don't know how to gain the powers or stories with less?
I'm sorry.
Just honest.
I don't get it.
Yeah, I don't get it.
Love You Wolf, very kind.
This is the film that media outlets were convincing people not to go to for fear of
getting shot.
Of course, of course, is a bit impressive.
It succeeded.
Yeah, I still think that it's absolutely reasonable to be impressed that this film
made over a billion dollars.
That's not easy for any film to do.
Yeah, any film making a billion dollars is impressive.
And I feel like he's fucking bitter about it.
He's like, he's a little bit bitter.
That's why I'm glad.
He's like, yeah, of course it was going to make this movie.
It's just about this thing.
People would pay for it no matter what.
It's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, be salty and bitter.
Diabeto.
I've been foiled again by Joker.
Drat.
And then he like flies away.
Can I say this?
Can I say this?
This is the film that media outlets.
So wait, sorry, Wolf, which hex would you bone?
Oh, did he answer that?
I think.
Yeah, he said thorn thorn.
Yeah, yeah, it's an easy one.
That's that's a softball.
So float that one over towards you.
Check out Ford versus Ferrari.
I've built cars and motorbikes from my old man, all my childhood.
And I thought it was based as hell.
Avoid the bitch boys.
Bitch boy takes from soy boys online and why it's problematic, though.
If I fucking if they tell me that it's misogynist because
not enough women have speaking roles or some shit and be like, OK, all right.
Just tell us beforehand what percentage of the show needs to have a
have females speaking in the cast, just so we know what what, you know, poof.
Me, I think I have just enough time to clean my dorm,
finish my papers and go to bed at a reasonable time.
Oh, a new efap.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Do all those things while listening to a fat.
You'll be fine.
Just, you know, take a look at the screen.
We have a movie.
Bob says something.
Yeah, this stream is great for when you're cleaning your place.
You kidding me?
Yeah.
All right.
Company in your room.
Hey, guys, clean your basement apartment.
Likelihood is somebody's like doing some cleaning right now.
Like, I don't know.
They're playing this on a TV or earbuds or something.
So we're like in the air while they're cleaning.
How does it feel to clean feel good?
Yes, sweet, sweet, sweet.
Sweep that up.
Gather that. Yes.
Put it in the bin.
Oh, you're moving some stuff on the shelf, huh?
Yeah, I'm watching you use the spot right now.
Now go back and get it.
Yeah, kind of left on the spot a little bit further.
Yeah, I think you got it.
It's under there.
That smell. It's under there.
Smells like old Cheetos.
Oh, no.
Glad you got that.
Glad you got that.
It's very good.
Wait, Ben wants to jump in.
Really?
Why?
We'll just add some super chats.
He's from drug and peasants.
Oh, yeah.
What do you reckon, Rags?
Yeah, go for it.
Why not?
Message me on Discord.
Just send me a message like, hello,
and then I'll add you in.
Mysterio acted alongside Joker in Brokeback Mountain.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, I mean, you know, I can't say they did a good job.
I have to say.
Sorry to jump ahead, but the super chat.
Does it hurt?
Even Brokeback Gotham.
Brokeback, oh, God.
Rags, who's Christian Bale?
Was he a character in A Knight's Tale?
Christian Bale?
No, he was not in A Knight's Tale.
Well, I mean, it's your question, Rags.
I wouldn't want to answer it for you.
I don't think Christian Bale was in A Knight's Tale.
I'm not sure, though.
Let me double check.
Maybe I forget.
I would feel betrayed by my memory
if he was in A Knight's Tale.
I'm pretty sure he's not.
No, I just got Knight of Cups, The Dark Knight.
Knight of Cups.
Knight of Cups.
Fico.
No, American Psycho.
Sorry.
American Fico.
Fanko.
American Fico.
I'll return some videotape.
Ford versus Ferrari.
Lamann 66 was really good, too.
Fair enough.
I mean, I guess I'll have to check out a lot of people saying it's good.
And God, if we need small fucking good movies for 2019,
I'm just saying.
Yeah, I'm going to see it.
Looks like my dad said he was interested in seeing it.
So I might I might go and see that.
So they canceled Victoria's Secret Fashion Show
because of these fat, blue head, same glasses sludge monster.
Also, high rags.
Hello.
Let's take a look.
Victoria's Secret.
Got a news.
Officially canned after outrage.
What?
What was the outrage?
Probably.
Damn, these attractive women.
Exactly.
All right.
Well, you know, a woman looking beautiful.
That's not right.
That's that is not a lot of rags.
Beauty is subjective.
You disgusting incel.
All women are ugly, then.
Now what?
Well, now what?
Look what you've done.
You've ruined everything like what you have done.
Look at the world you've created.
Look Diabeto upon your creation and despair.
This is the future you chose.
Our God is finally here.
Praise be the roofs.
You're a lot of fans there are.
This is just what I needed to get me through work.
Well, if you're still here, Andrew,
I hope work is going well.
Work, work, work.
The black shading that Anna was describing about the hex skills
is why Spider-Man's legs are blue.
Originally, he was red and black with blue shading on the legs
to define the muscle and everything.
How about that?
I always thought that the black was just really heavy shading.
It's racist.
What am I a comic nerd?
Like, what did you take me for?
Well, black is just heavy shading.
I can't accept that.
Look, black hid hex skill with Velma on my face.
What?
Look, black hid hex skill with Velma on my face.
Like Velma's sitting on your face?
I guess so.
And then he's gunning for the hex skills.
He's gunning for Thorn with Velma on the face.
All right.
All right.
Raven is best.
Raven is best goth crush.
Hex skills, hold my beer.
Oh, I see.
Oh, yeah, from Teen Titans.
Oh, is that what that is?
I have heard a lot of people like Raven, yes.
I've not seen Teen Titans, I'm afraid.
Don't forget Scooby Dum.
Oh, yes, we did mention Scooby Dum earlier.
Yeah, just a moment ago.
Scooby Dum.
Scooby Jew, I remember that, yes.
Movie Bob.
I don't, I don't, oh, no idea.
She says, Movie Bob, Rob, we're going to need a stronger roof.
Before Rock and Throw, he just cracks through the roof.
And he's like, what the fuck, it's my house, dude.
It's like dropping a metal rod from space.
It lands and just, oh, the impact.
Cataclysm.
Energy, end of the world scenario.
That's why Movie Bob, whenever he wants, he can end the world.
If he just jumps up and down, oh, that kind of power.
Oh, my goodness.
Knock us out of orbit, kill us immediately.
He'll just, he's like, I'll end it all.
If we don't get, if we don't get eugenics like I want,
I'm going to end it all.
If you don't kill this list of people,
I'm just going to kill everybody.
I'll step off my rascal.
Oh, no.
Did someone say Scooby Jew?
See, that's the thing.
Now I can't get the depiction of that out of my head.
What would you rather than say, dooby doo?
I don't.
Dooby doo.
Dooby doo.
Dooby doo, I tell you.
Dooby doo.
Yeah, fair warning, Ben.
A lot of these won't make any sense.
That's fine.
I'm going to try to behave too.
We've got reams of behave.
What do you mean?
This is the fact.
I don't know.
I'm trying to be a sweet boy.
I don't know.
We'll see.
We just got done talking about Scooby Jew
and throwing people off of roofs.
Scooby Jew.
Commonly known for roof throwing.
You're like, I don't remember that.
Yay.
At least you're known for something.
All I had to do on the internet was admit once
that my DNA test showed one percent Jew.
And now everyone has pasted a luchador mask
over all of these weird Holocaust propaganda photos.
Well, you know, sometimes you walk yourself into these things, I guess.
Anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if movie Bob was a closet Nazi.
That man should never be under any circumstances.
Get any political power.
Yes, agreed.
But I don't think we should be fine on that regard.
Scooby doo and the angry Jew.
Let's see who this ghost really is.
Old man, Goldstein.
Oh, God.
Good job for finding out who the monster was.
How for that, we're going to give you a few Scooby shekels.
Oh, man.
Gold scene, the guy who runs the local pawn shop.
I knew it was you, you bastard.
Got no way with it, too.
We're going to be a dumb dog.
Like a hot dumb dog.
You dumb dog.
I can't believe this.
You guys think that I ever got to Scooby after all those episodes
being called a dumb dog, you think he was ever like, OK, enough.
In the ever snapped and just ripped someone's throat out.
Could you imagine what it was like being compared to Marmaduke
for your entire career?
Oh, yeah, rough.
Eventually just loses the speech impediment and talk some serious shit.
If Scooby was racist, would he hate riggers?
Oh, so riggers are like people who rig things up, you know, like sound.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah, lighting fixtures, you know, really seriously, like.
Scooby is to Marmaduke, what Heathcliff is to Garfield.
Well, Heathcliff.
Yeah.
Wasn't Heathcliff practically just a scrappy dude
that actually did beat up things?
No, no, Heathcliff was Garfield only with a slightly different personality,
an orange cat that was fat.
Well, sure, in the looks department.
I see. I see this here.
It only ran for about a year.
I mean, like he he was he was like smarmy like Garfield,
but then he like always beat everything up.
I don't know. Yeah.
Heathcliff was like, I guess, a homeless cat when Garfield wasn't.
That was like the main difference.
No, this he wasn't part of the the.
Oh, the Cadillac cats.
Yes, different. Yeah, that was the that was the junkyard cats
that lived in the same universe as Heathcliff.
Why the fuck are they drawing these cats so sexy?
No, like one of the Cadillac cats is like supposed is drawn
like supposed to be like really hot for a cat.
OK, I think he landed on.
I'll never forget this week.
We had Adam from your movie Sucks on DP one time,
and he was telling me he was he liked he likes cat men.
So I was showing him Thundercats.
And I'm like, which Thundercat are you most attracted to?
It was kind of different.
Did he have an answer? Oh, my Jesus Christ.
Not really. I guess panther.
Panthero, I guess, technically.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, making it making the choice is what you got to do.
Everyone's like, oh, right.
He's like, no, it doesn't look good.
Show cats is clearly supposed to be a sexy cat.
Proto fairy.
I'm just describing what the show is.
You disturbed all of chat rags.
Well done. Good. Why?
I didn't. I didn't draw it.
I'll never forget the first episode of Thundercats because they're all naked.
Have you guys ever seen?
Do you guys remember the first Thundercats episode?
Maybe not. I never watched that.
I was aware of it, but I never watched it.
I can't type in the cats naked because I know, you know, they were all
anthropomorphic people, cats, but more towards the human side.
Right. The first episode, they're all nude.
They don't realize that.
Yeah, belts and shoes.
And the kids. Oh, yeah, right there.
There you go. Oh, no.
Yeah. Chitara.
Nipple is Chitara with no nipples.
That must be the peeps.
That must have been weird drawn.
Yeah, we're drawing that.
I think it was anime animator.
It's the same animation team that did Thundercats or Silver Hawks.
Rather, Silver Hawk, Silver Hawk.
I mean, they're wearing belts.
That counts as clothes. It's fine.
They got those are accessories.
So how did we wind up here anyway?
Rags are talking about sexy cats.
No, one of the one of the Cadillac cats his name is Cleo, as I've discovered.
I'm a sexy cat.
Need to watch.
So we clearly drawn to be a sexy cat.
And I just pointed this out because it's odd.
So apparently it makes me a bad person.
They go chat. It was all to rags.
OK. OK. Yeah, I just it's impossible to not notice.
Go to Google.
Google Cadillac cats. Right.
And then you'll be like, oh, obviously I know exactly which one he's referring to.
So we've we've gone from Scooby Doo to Heathcliff to sexy cats.
And all the way back to reluctant werewolf is the best Scooby Jew film.
All right.
I love how someone found the photo of the naked cats
and and they are all totally naked.
Yeah, they're just saying.
That I don't it's it's weird.
It is very strange.
Because like it like if they if they ever want to like fuck or jerk off
or something like that, like what where does it just like spring out or like in between?
Where what's going on?
Rags needs to know the answers to these questions.
OK, this is some deep lore we're diving into here.
Thanks, Rags. I got a virus now.
There's something wrong with the Cadillac cats.
You can't trick me into fairy sexy doggo.
I'm not.
Everyone's like, oh, you said that's like, no, look at it.
Like, look at the hips, man.
That was on your hair.
Look, if you go look at the the picture of the Cadillac cats.
This picture is actually a picture of a picture.
Very strange.
You got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
There's seven cats.
I'll tell you what, the leg warmers do it for me.
The leg warmers. Oh, yeah.
Just like Olivia Newton, John, basically.
Oh, yeah.
Let's get physical at that Xanadu looking sort of.
Like what are you wear clothes?
No, just like warmers.
Just just enough clothes to acknowledge the rest of me is naked.
It's cool. I got hair all over my chest.
All right. Yeah.
You know, because she's wearing clothes in this one.
She's got this big pink coat and gloves.
She's got a leg warmers on, of course.
Uh huh. Leg warmers are still canon.
It's strange.
And again, I didn't make it.
I'm just pointing out that it's weird.
All right.
I'm sure you've justified yourself to chat at this point.
I'm sure they don't think any less or or anything of you.
Yeah, I'm sure no one thinks any lesser of me for pointing this out.
Thoughts on KK being Katharine Kennedy saying that the sequels were hard
to make because she had no source material, expanded universe rules in its grave.
Thanks for making life great, guys.
Have a good fap. Thank you very much.
And yeah, we've covered this a few times now, but really dumb.
And just because you have no source material
doesn't mean you can't fucking continue a story.
Holy shit.
I thought that's the whole reason these writers for millions of dollars
because they know how to fucking write.
Was that the woman in fan base that you guys pissed off?
Is that what that was?
No, Kathy Kennedy is the like CEO of Lucasfilm right now, I think.
Oh, OK.
They're talking about like how she's recently said that, you know,
Marvel has it easier because they have source material to work from
when that's Disney fucking nuked the extended universe
or expanded universe.
So it's just like, how can you fucking say that?
What the hell?
And then it also implies the like a lot of the films in the Marvel universe
like go off script completely.
Like you might be like, oh, but they still have time to work from fucking
they practically made their own films.
And, you know, a lot of people take issue with that.
Like some of the films take the names of some kind of comic story,
but then they alter it completely.
Right. I'm just waiting for the Natalie Portman Thor film.
Right. Yeah, that's because you know, that's going to be.
Yeah, or Natalie Thorman.
Natalie Thortman.
Scooby Doo meets the Jew brothers.
Oh, no. Scooby Jew.
But Hitler love dogs.
Oh, that's I'm surprised you were allowed to say Hitler in a super chair.
I thought they prevent that. Oh, my goodness.
Wow. Yeah, he got away with that.
Thanks. Thanks, Google, for letting people reference historical figures.
How about how about Scooby Doo meets Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein?
I mean, I think it can work.
Scooby Doo and pedophile, I wouldn't have gotten away for it.
Take him down.
They could have if it weren't for them sneaking kids.
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of stories to go.
I think it'll be a whole season's worth of stories here.
Um. And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling.
Yids. Oh, I get it.
I get that.
I know that Star Wars, Jeb and Jay Long Jeb.
I feel like that joke was already made.
All right. And then was going to get them Jeb versions out there.
Scooby Doo in the Jew school.
I don't know if I saw that one.
Scooby Doo in the Syrian invaders.
A weekly effect is this last story?
What was the last picture that you?
What was the last picture Rags posted?
It's because it was just one of the images where she was just getting like
and get someone from the show against weird.
Like the people who made this were clearly like, guys,
I got to draw these ugly characters, but Cleo.
Oh, man. Oh, man.
You have to draw her doing anything.
I want to get her man handled.
It's hot when she gets kidnapped.
A weekday, what madness is this long man?
How shall your audience sleep now?
They'll find a way.
When that could be able to sleep in three hours.
Yeah. Yeah.
We've got exactly two hours and 12 minutes.
We probably will not beat all the super chats by then,
but we should get pretty close.
Go, go.
When that cold bob hits.
I think it's rich.
The movie of all things.
He's some sort of uber mensch when he looks like he's been thrown
into a gas chamber.
Oh, uber mensch.
He looks like he's he looks like he is kind of a balloon person.
Like if you poked him, he would he would go
and start flying around the room.
I mean, we did.
We did say Diabeto could fly.
So he's the uber mensch.
He lets air out a full off he goes.
So, right.
I'm going to read this and well, I just I'm going to read it.
I'm going to read it as it said.
Right. All right.
Do you suck toes?
Because I've got 10 little piggies that could use some mouth hugs.
Oh, my goodness.
No, I don't suck toes.
I'm so sorry.
I'll eat ass, man.
But I ain't going to put my mouth on toes.
Draw the line.
I get to draw the line somewhere.
Oh, the next one just says hi, Rags.
Hello. Hello. Hello.
Have you ever gone in to eat the ass and then like the smell of the turkey?
Like, oh, you welcome back.
So then you like did like a loop to loop and came back around.
Fucking joints.
And you say that like that wasn't really right.
Generally, it's just like a drag over the top.
You know, the pure timing.
Because you want to kind of get them in the shower so you could sort of.
Talking about talking about these masks and interesting conversation.
Yep.
Don't worry.
Me and both terrified, too.
I'm very big of that statement here.
It's better.
You have better luck eating out guys than gals.
Is that effect?
Yeah, because at least in my experience, right?
You have a guy over here with you with you with a dude, right?
You know what's going on back there and you've prepared.
You know, you know what's going on back there, right?
You're someone's ass is getting
is going to be going to be part of the action, right?
So they know to make sure it's all nice and looking good.
And, you know, you know, prim and proper, right?
You know, they they know they know.
Oh, that's it.
Oh, I can finally sleep tonight.
Oh, it's because it's because there's no other alternatives.
So they got to make sure it works, right?
Well, yeah, I mean, you know, it's like, you know,
someone's getting fucked in the ass, right?
And so you want it to, you know, is cool prep involved?
You know what? Looking good and everything.
So you get down there and you're like, man, this is looking all right.
You've been doing some work.
All right. I can see the logic.
Welcome back, Star Wars, girl.
Welcome to talking about.
Well, I asked the best question at the best possible moment.
That's really low.
I did not think I was going to walk into this conversation.
So when I first came in here, I'm like, I, I have to watch what I say here.
And Mahler's like, you're on eFAP.
I'm like, all right.
Let's go. Let's go all the way then.
You know, we mentioned at the beginning that this is not a kid friendly stream.
No, it's really bad.
Oh, did you mark that?
Oh, we totally marked that.
Kids shouldn't be fucking watching the shake.
Oh, they should go watch Lord Genesis instead.
Yes. And then then then run away in fear.
But, you know, any choice or he's become.
Oh, my God.
Oh, his dad got interviewed the other night.
But yeah, by police. Really?
No, no. By by a live streamer, his dad answered a random call
from a live streamer and talked about a lot of stuff.
Oh, I don't know why.
But his dad seems like a pretty reasonable
still an enabler, but pretty reasonable kind of guy.
Oh, I'm sure he's probably someone who's like doing everything held hostage
in the house. Yeah.
I mean, seeing as how senior Genesis turned out,
I kind of imagine he's an enabler.
Maybe Jared cast a spell.
You don't know what his power is.
You know what he could do.
He's a real man.
So this just says, hi, Wolf, who?
And then the next one says, Scooby, Jooby, Joo, where are you?
Oh, no, you're a bad part of the super chat.
And then it's gone for hours.
Yeah, I know. You know how long this takes.
I know. It describes that as a Schindler's List sequel.
Oh, no, I don't I don't think so.
I don't think there's less the musical.
I don't know if Spielberg will be on board, but maybe producing.
I don't know.
He'd still be wrong because you talked Scooby Doo.
I'm not sure that's referencing.
We got the good Jayon for once.
Also, hi, that Star Wars girl.
I forget her name. It's Anna.
She didn't say hi back, damn.
No, it's a shame.
Oh, man.
See, Rags, you've created an expectation now
where people think they're going to get a high back.
But, you know, sometimes it's not the case.
Sometimes it's not the case.
Juby doo Scooby Doo meets Juman and Robin.
All right.
If I know what that wasn't even clever, you just said you instead of bat.
I don't know. All right.
Wouldn't it have been funnier to swap out bads?
It was bat Jew, like bats.
I don't know that'd be better.
You're saying her standards are sinking here.
If an orphan eats alone, is it a family meal?
Oh, depends on the definition from the piss and providing the meal.
Like, you know, you know, family, if it means like everyone
who's related to you in blood and there's just you.
But like most people don't go by any kind of definition like that.
It's usually like, you know, if I go to bed, right?
It's not like all the family is taking a nap.
She's had it.
Well, I mean, if you were the only one in your family left, maybe it is
because they're with you in spirit and they go to sleep with you.
You know, I'm not Ray.
Not all the spirits of the the Jedi before me
are going to be there to sleep with me or whatever.
You don't know that I have no idea.
I don't even know.
I don't even know what the rules are anymore.
I don't know that the rules are that there are no rules.
That's the big rule. Clearly.
We've got fusion now.
Cancel culture is the inevitable end point of letting holes
have a voice in society backs.
Thanks, Ron. Yeah, Ron with the takes.
Scooby doo and the Jew invaders.
All right. That's just a variation of the other one you did.
I see right through you.
Here's my free super chat money.
Thank you very much.
Also, an efap with Wolf and Jay Longbone and Anna and special guest rags.
What a wonderful surprise this is.
I know. Oh, my goodness.
Very special. Yes. Yeah.
When we started that up nine and 10 hours ago, you know,
it was an interesting stream that that was
Scooby Jew and the cyber Jew or Scooby Doo in the cyber Jew.
Sorry, I didn't want to misrepresent that.
Scooby doo and the cyber Jew.
Michael Moore is a fat traitor.
And that is a quote from Diabeto.
Was was move up like giving Michael more shit for liking Joker?
He gave him shit for saying it was the thing about Columbine.
I forget the specifics.
Oh, Scooby Doo and the curse of the 13th Jew.
Why the 13th one cast a spell, but everyone knows
there used to use the unlucky one.
Oh, there was a there was a Scooby Doo Halloween special
when I was a kid called the 13 Ghosts of Scooby Doo back in the day.
That might be worth a referencing. Maybe. Yep.
Uh, which show is crazier, Anna, Efap or The Jack Show?
Um, probably The Jack Show.
Yeah, we're pretty tame here.
Everything's mostly normal.
Aside from talking about anything weird, it was a pretty normal conversation.
Everyone talks about that every day all the time.
It's fine. You guys have yet to talk about cancer babies on Efap.
So I guess cancer babies.
Well, give it.
We haven't we had an AIDS bus. Does that come close?
The AIDS bus hit the orphans or something and they create cancer babies.
It's a simple formula.
At least your parents didn't have to watch you die young of cancer.
Oh, no, no, no, cancer baby lived.
It's a it's a thing.
OK, OK. All right.
That's cool. Happy endings.
Don't forget about Scooby Dolby.
Dumb. He's the best.
Scooby Dolby dumb.
Yeah, do they just mean Scooby dumb?
There was a Scooby dumb. Yeah.
I don't know. I don't know Scooby Dumb's middle name.
I don't know that much of the lore.
You know, they were giving me
to the worst, fallen order Jedi I have seen, but still love your content.
No more gay jacking with Jay.
Oh, they're talking about my stream.
In fairness, I was on the hardest difficulty.
I never played it before, but I was pretty bad.
I'll give it to you. I was pretty bad.
And no more gay jacking with Jay.
I don't know. I didn't know I was gay.
That's where do you have cameras screwed up?
Shouldn't be shouldn't be shouldn't be commenting on such things.
Are they referring to the Twam stream?
I don't know. Star Wars girl, I heard you lack knowledge of the EU
and I want to help. EU stands for European Union.
Star Wars was filmed there.
It's embarrassing not to know this, but you know, life saved.
I didn't know it was filmed there.
Oh, hold on. Hold on.
To is Tunisia and the European Union.
I think they're talking about the new films,
how they were filmed in like Ireland and stuff.
Oh, but I did know that and I do know about the expanded universe.
So I don't think I'm lacking too much knowledge on it.
The only thing I'm lacking knowledge in is stuff about Revan.
But that's because I was told not to read the books
because apparently the books are shit and to play the game.
But I am notoriously awful at playing video games. So, uh, yeah.
Right, then people like Baba,
why kids like me got bullied worse after Columbine.
Tubby forgets people got typecast to the school shooters of a media.
Yeah, I wouldn't know.
I don't know if that actually they're probably Nazis. It's fine.
Oh, OK. Yeah.
Well, what do you what do you call it?
The natural selection of intelligence or something like
intellectual fitness.
I don't even know what he means exactly by that.
Like, how does someone get knocked out of the gene pool through an intelligence?
Like in our society, that's not a thing.
Is it outside of if they accidentally kill themselves,
which is not going to happen, I don't think.
Not for the amount that he was.
Like the stupid people all killed themselves accidentally.
I like the idea that he says that we're just like,
this is mysterious.
All of them have been shot in the back of the head.
He's like, yep, it's weird.
They're dumb. They're really, you know, those stupid dumb people.
Oh, Jesus.
Now it's just up to a smart, dumb heart.
I mean, everybody would easily elect him as president.
He knows what's up.
He knows what he's doing.
And God, we trust is a thing that he actually has on his videos.
Oh, that's right.
He does does have the I am God.
Bob, no, I got it.
Yeah, but God doesn't have to catch his breath every time he says it.
OK, this is how it's spelled, guys.
You we a wise it isn't Sunday white.
Also, hi, ooh, wags.
Hello.
If the reason for a shooting was breathing oxygen,
would they say breathing is bad?
Breathing is bad.
Breathing is not he's breathe.
Hitler did it.
Yeah, Hitler drink water.
Yeah, there's proof.
There's a video where he breathes.
I've seen it.
Fucking got him.
The Darwin Awards are a thing, a hilarious and tragic thing.
Yeah, I know.
But you never get it.
So what he's after is like knocking out this enormous portion of like
the American population.
And he's like, ah, intellectual, natural selection.
It's like, I don't think I don't.
Most people don't accidentally kill themselves regularly.
Well, you know, yeah, most people aren't so dumb.
They kill themselves accidentally.
Sneaky, what the fuck?
Also, hey, Jay Longbone, your hair has been on fire recently.
It's very true.
Friendly reminder.
Death to the aliens.
Hashtag humanity first.
Hashtag human supremacy.
Oh, my goodness.
I wanted to ask you guys something now that I have you all here.
Have you have you read the Timothy Zahn Star Wars novels?
Yes.
OK, like that, for me, was the continuation after the original trilogy.
Did you read that kind of wish ology?
I'm I'm not familiar with that.
No, I'm not.
No, I read like Dark Force Rising and like the trilogy that came after that.
Like, OK, so yeah.
Yeah, you should read the duology.
I actually think it's better than the trilogy.
It takes place 10 years after the trilogy came out.
It's really good.
It's called The Hand of Thrawn duology.
Did you ever read the the one where Luke finds the glove of Darth Vader?
And it like.
I read like, you know, because there was such a there was such a void
of Star Wars content forever between the original, you know,
between the early 80s and the the prequels
that there was so much fiction being written at the time.
And I don't think they cared anything about continuity at all with it.
They were just kind of like whipping it out.
So there were so many series of novels that are now erased.
Simply by Disney acquiring the Star Wars property.
Yeah, it's insulting to everyone that put all that time in.
And I think one of the great things is that Timothy Zahn did
because there was a series that came out in between.
There's a few of them that came out in between his.
I hope I think you could just win.
Is she gone? Oh, no.
Am I tweaking out again?
Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, we lost you.
My Internet is shit, but yeah.
Well, what did you do earlier?
You just cut off mid-sentence.
What was the last thing I said?
Were you even listening, sir, about the Timothy Zahn and then like that was lost.
Oh, he actually took the time to read the books that came out in between
when he wrote the trilogy and the duology.
So he adds in characters
and he explains things that people freaked out about
because somebody wrote this stupid trilogy, which I mean, some people like it.
I'm not the biggest fan of it.
I don't think it was that great.
But it's where Luke is training Jedi and they're on, you know, the base in Yavin.
And one of his students, you know, gets this dark side inkling.
So to understand him and to relate to him, Luke taps into that dark side power.
And people lost their minds like, Luke is going to the dark side.
It's like, no, he just tried it to relate to the student
to make sure that the student wouldn't go to the dark side.
And it didn't fail.
All these people died.
But you know, you're right.
That is the equivalent of that.
You're right.
Well, but he added it in and he answered all the questions and he fixed it.
So I was like, he did such a good job.
They should just have him write the movies.
But yeah, well, yeah, yeah.
OK, fine. They erased, you know, the EU.
But look what we got in return.
Such great films.
If you do it, hoping if you directed a series of movies
and there was a scene in the second movie
where one of the one of the characters got sucked out into the vacuum of space.
And at that point, the actor was already literally dead.
Why would you not kill them?
Well, we were all understood.
Yeah, like, yeah, I think I think that we would all come to it,
but it would have been fucking shocking to be like, that's she's dead.
Wow. Yeah, I was like, finally, I was like, I was like, all right.
They're going to honor her this way.
They kill her off like whatever.
Yeah. And then they brought her back in.
I'm like, wait, you killed Harrison Ford already.
You killed all these people that are still alive.
Yeah, one the one original Star Wars actress that's gone.
Is the one you still in the.
Yeah, like what?
Well, we've got to have we got to have Leia live and be amazing
and incredible. Fuck.
Everyone else is animated.
Well, she's the only like original series character they can't ruin.
Unfortunately, she's the only one that died.
And the fucking I'm pretty sure we let me make that comment.
It's like such a fucking tragedy.
She's the only one who is left.
And technically, I've ruined and she could fucking die.
If they can't ruin it, it's because they protected her too much.
She was like too protected.
I mean, forget the fact she kissed her brother, right?
But, you know, outside of her.
I mean, there's a silence.
Right.
I thought everyone kissed their brother.
What? Not everyone knows who my brother is.
Everyone settled down. All right.
Please. I know.
Well, I mean, well, have you ever heard of
have you ever heard of dianor before?
Are you familiar with dianor?
I am dianor.
Is he one of the Cadillac cats?
No, I feel like I'm the one who will get dianor.
Dianor. Yeah, yeah, dianor.
Have you got a picture on hand?
You can show him that.
Do you? OK, Mahler, you you know who dianor is, right?
Yeah, but OK.
Should we show them the picture or what?
Yeah, well, yeah, I won't show.
Hold on. Oh, my God.
This design stole, sold, and I can prove it.
This design sold 5000 T-shirts.
I believe that.
OK. Now, all right.
You should give them the give them the law of how it happened.
OK, so this t-shirt first, where is it?
Dina or there's a popular character.
Popular character on my show named Jim Ass,
who was totally not someone I know, who's not someone I'm asked to.
Yeah, Jim Ass. OK.
Like, are you like? Yeah, Jim Ass.
Yeah, I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what.
Jim Ass was so notorious
and his personality was so well-loved and prolific
that even till this day, people think that Mr.
Medeker is secretly Jim Ass, but he's not.
Well, now you just spoiled it.
No, I didn't. Well.
All right, there you go.
I posted it. So I want to let you all know this design.
And this is not a joke.
We sold 5000 t-shirts of that design on it.
Oh, is that a whim brand?
Yeah, let me get that on the screen for the.
A lot of people in this channel probably know it if they've watched Drunken Peasants.
Some of them might.
Like, I'm not even going to lie, I think I would probably.
I know her.
Dina, I know.
Yeah, I know.
Trogdor Blarg.
It's well, what can we really say?
It's wonderful.
Yeah, yeah.
Thank you, Jim Ass.
I like how the dino looks like he's got a poop on deck.
About to explode.
Dina was crowning.
Is that what you're saying?
Oh, no, he's he's horribly constipated.
Oh, my goodness.
He has to. Well, he has to take a fucking dinosaur sized.
You know, you know, those massive piles from Jurassic Park.
Actually, the hilarious thing is Teespring thought a little kid drew that
and featured it on all their social media.
And they're like, oh, isn't this cute?
It's like, oh, yeah, this is totally.
Taking a great big number two, nor.
To know that's the meteor that the Earth.
Yes. Anyway, so, yeah, this is just the next super chat.
I read like there's no, you know, I'm just going to people are born Nazis.
That's that's what it says.
Oh, it says this.
I don't know about that.
But well, it's a quote, you see.
Oh, that's me. And it's a quote from Sino Sinema Roberto.
I just can't quote from it.
Did he really say that?
That's the thing. I can't tell what's a parody.
Yeah, I was going to say, I can't fucking confirm that.
He might have.
He's pretty close.
I guess for Anna and for Ben, we're going to play a game on a future
evap called Who Said It? Movie Bob or Hitler.
And we have to decide whether or not movie Bob or Hitler.
Well, we have to have wolf on for that as well.
That'd be funny.
It'll be great. Oh, for sure. For sure.
So here's the thing, though, if he says Nazis are born,
does that mean being a Nazi is not a choice
and he shouldn't discriminate?
You shouldn't discriminate against them if it's not their choice.
Yeah. Yeah.
And for Bob, oh, oh, spaghetti.
Oh, movie, Bob. Yeah. Oh, no.
It sounds pretty bigoted. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Well.
Why movie, Bob? Why?
I'd kill to know how cinema Roberto got his views.
He was there in the beginning.
That's all the explanation I've got. Yeah, I think that's about right.
He was around for pretty much everyone else.
He was one of the old school guys he got in her.
And he just kept on making like he must have
he must have made a staggering amount of videos by now.
Well, he used to do like big animations and shit
like with like the overthinker and the stuff like that.
Yeah, he's like a bunch of cream screen.
Yeah. I remember people saying the videos where he's like really that bad
or really that good.
I remember people saying that those are better from him.
But it wasn't his take still bad regardless.
I'm pretty sure they were.
Probably.
I mean, he was one of the people who came to the one of his big things
that kind of you know, he was one of those pro Anita Sarkeesian people
and he was anti-gammergate and Anita didn't do nothing.
And she's, you know, an angel and just a bunch of angry white men
don't like women in their video games.
She's a fucking idiot.
It's definitely been impressing people on Twitter lately.
Well, yes, big, big and press.
Um.
Do you?
Don't you guys know talking is basically murder.
So all of you saying not all Nazis are Columbine shooters is wrong.
Also, Nazis is banned.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Nazis is banned.
To clarify, I got away with it.
He said Nazis is bad.
Sad face.
He said, to clarify, I'm sad about the censorship only.
I'm not sad about the lack of Nazis or anything.
You know, it's just fine.
Um, I need to talk easy.
And Donald Trump actually agree that video games cause violence,
but Anita would never admit it.
Oh, that's good.
No, you had to mention her name.
I know.
It's well, you have to say it three times for anything to happen, right?
Well, she accused me of raping her
just because I took a photo.
Why? Oh, oh.
Wait, why? OK.
OK.
Starting from five, five years ago,
I was in a tabletop gaming place in Columbus, Ohio,
and I'm just playing my game with my friends there.
Oh, what game was it?
And then I.
I don't even remember now.
You're in the patriarchy.
Yeah. Mm hmm.
I forget things.
Well, you know, I think it might have been Stratego.
Oh, Stratego.
Or crossbows and catapults, if you're familiar with that.
That was another one I played there.
No, I haven't heard of it.
So I'm playing my game.
I look up the door opens.
Who walks in? Literally Anita Sarkeesian.
She walks in.
She walks down the stairs and sits behind me.
And I'm like, no one is going to believe that Anita Sarkeesian
came in here and sat behind me.
Yeah. So so I took a picture of her over my shoulder.
Why didn't you just ask to get a selfie with her?
Well, that's what that's what a boogie did.
Did she know who you were?
I don't know. She wouldn't have known.
But why didn't you just ask her, hey, can I take a selfie with you?
She would say yes.
That's her giving you consent.
And then you post it.
Because she's going to probably freak out or say selfies.
Yeah. She had like an entourage with him, too.
You know, if you say, oh, my gosh, Anita Sarkeesian,
my friends aren't going to believe that, you know, can I take a selfie with you?
Maybe 100 percent say yes.
If she's got her little entourage, she would feel super special about it.
And then when you post it and she loses her fucking shit,
it's like, bitch, you fucking smiled.
You said it would have been hilarious if you said I'm a part of this.
Part of this is like someone I was associated with at the time
was one of her least favorite people ever.
But on top of that.
Well, did she see that person?
Tell that person to go to the bathroom when there's an entourage.
No, no. And you know what?
I could have I could have like been disingenuous
and gotten her to take her picture taken with me. Sure.
But it's not disingenuous
if you're literally going to take a picture of her anyway and say, hey,
like, I guess it depends on how you sell it.
If you're like, I'm a fan of yours.
If you were like, I don't like you, but I'd like to take a picture with you.
I can almost guarantee you she would have said no anyway.
You just say, hey, nobody's going to believe that I ran into you.
Can I take a selfie with you?
Yeah, she's notorious for never addressing any criticism
or doing any debates or doing any conversations with people.
Like the closest thing you're going to get to Anita Sarkeesian,
like addressing her critics is when she called Sargon a garbage human.
Yeah, that's the closest you're getting.
Wasn't Sargon in the chat earlier?
Yes, he was. Yeah, he was.
He visits every now and again.
He hasn't come on the show.
He said he's floating around, he's keeping an eye on us,
making sure we're not too crazy.
Mm hmm.
He's been on TV a couple of times, too.
Good guy. Mm hmm. Good guy.
How does he get his move, Carl?
So anyway, get back to how you raped a person.
OK. Yeah, yeah.
Um, I'm I'm I just found the photo.
Oh, my God, it's been so long.
We're coming up on the anniversary of this shit.
Like, wow, yes, it's been a long.
So I just posted it there.
There's the photo of of me and my face and then Anita sitting behind me.
But yeah, she took that and made it seem like I stalked her.
Literally, I was the long way.
I was there before she showed up and I left before she left.
So no stalking on my point on my part whatsoever.
But then she got a weird question to ask, but what's.
Which piercing hurt more, your nose ring or your lip ring?
Nose ring.
It's almost like getting punched in the nose.
You know, it breaks the tear line.
You have a line from the bottom of your mouth all the way up like through
between the center of your eyes, where if you get hit hard enough there, you will cry.
So it's kind of like that.
But the the tattoos on both of my arm, like I have both of my arms totally covered
and those hurt way more than every any piercing.
Piercings like a lot of pain all at once.
And then it tapers out and like tattoos is like a little bit of pain
spread out over a really long time.
Mm hmm. Huh. Makes sense to me.
So so she caught you taking that picture, then.
She didn't catch it.
No, no, no, I posted it on Twitter, actually.
Actually, when I saw Anita show up, I went into the bathroom
and called my friend TJ and was like, TJ, Anita is here
and you should come down here and we can get like a photo of you
like shaking her hand or whatever.
And he's like, nah, fuck it.
I'm not coming down.
Like, all right.
Well, no one's going to believe we were here.
So I'm just going to take a quick photo of her.
Took the photo left, posted it on Twitter.
And then like hours later,
there was like a bunch of virtue signaling feminists
accusing me of committing a crime
by taking a photo of a public figure in a public place.
Yes. Yeah.
Yeah, you never know.
And that's great.
I was going to say, we just got done with our version of that.
Like, not the same thing, but similar.
The whole oh, my goodness, what's happening?
Well, what's happening?
People are suddenly just lost rags and that's the whole skill.
Oh, no.
And you know, some of some of
whoever that woman was and her fan base that you pissed off.
I can't remember her name right now.
Her fans came to the stream that you guys were on with us
and disparaged you. Yeah.
Some of them, a couple of them showed up.
And I'm like, what?
Well, like in the in the stream channel, the comments.
In in the in the comments after the episode, you guys were on.
You were saying T.J. Amazing Atheist?
Yes. Yes. Yes.
With Amazing Atheist, me and T.J.
did Drunken Peasants for four years together.
So yeah.
Yeah, like we really pissed off a lot of people.
You know, it's funny, though, as you've been here for this long now,
this is honestly absorbs probably the majority of that Jenny stream.
What we're doing right now.
And it's like not even to do with it.
And yet people will be like, let's discuss.
You talk about it for that long.
It's like she's not that interesting. Trust me.
However, Scooby Jew, infinite amount of time to talk about that.
Oh, yeah, that's that's what I mean.
Like, what about Scooby?
People who are fans of Scooby and the Harlem Globetrotters.
That was my favorite episode.
And Batman or Robin.
Those are my my favorites. Hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Rags just said his Internet is apparently down right now.
I don't know if he's trying to get it back up, but that was a weird coincidence.
Yeah, and a discord like tweaked out for a minute.
And I thought I saw everyone and it didn't say that anything was disconnected.
I thought we were all just playing the silent game.
And I was trying so hard not to mention everything.
I mentioned he who can't be named in the Internet when.
Oh, who cannot be named?
I don't know.
I don't know who you're talking about.
If he says it again, everything will go to shit.
I know. Yeah, that's happened.
Did you did you notice like literally the moment I?
Yeah, what if he types it in a secret way?
No, just can I get hints?
No, I don't get hints.
Also, I was going to say, no,
that it was just funny that people would like to say all their stuff about this,
this stream, but then fans of it are just confused
because of the amount of stupid shit we talk about.
And that's just sort of the funny conclusion.
We'd be really bad at our jobs if our goal was to just hate on women
slash people of color slash every kind of ist and ism you can imagine.
It's like, man, we're really inefficient, too.
It's like if that's all we did, I'm pretty sure we would not last at all
because that like if we did, that shit gets boring quick. Yes.
You got to throw in some Scooby Doo, some big ideas, some Singapore.
There's this clowns.
Like there's a lot of really important details into this mixture, this recipe.
Yeah, you know, before before.
Well, I was just going to say quick, right?
This next super chest sums it up.
You got you got to listen to this.
Who would you who would win in a fight to the death?
A tiny Gandalf with no magic, but he has a dagger or tiny Hitler.
But he tiny Hitler has no weapons, but he's in his prime.
Gandalf is four inches tall and tiny Hitler is six inches tall.
Gandalf, Gandalf, a four inch Gandalf with no magic,
but he still has a dagger of his as a Hitler without a dagger.
But he's in his prime and he's six inches.
Hitler was not a combatant.
He's so hard to answer.
And I was pretty old and he has no magic.
No, no. And I'll tell you why.
I'll tell you why it's hard to answer, because Gandalf in of himself is immortal, right?
I don't. Yeah, I don't think a knife could kill him.
Or could it?
Wait, a mortal than he's not Gandalf.
Wait, does it mean like we have to fight them?
In fairness, and mortal doesn't mean unkillable, though.
It means you live for right.
Without killing somebody can kill you.
But who are they fighting?
Well, each other, each other.
Oh, they're fighting each other.
Oh, Gandalf will win.
Gandalf can outsmart Gandalf would win because he'd outsmart Hitler
and Gandalf has seen more battles.
Hitler is just some fucking barking dog in a uniform.
I mean, I guess that's a Gandalf has the knife, too.
So yeah, exactly.
He may be shorter by two inches, but he's got the weapon.
He's got the edge.
Yeah, and that's the thing.
It's all like a lot of people like to boast like it's not that hard to do.
So I'm going to go with the knife.
It's like, no, it fucking isn't.
A knife is really goddamn easy to get cut by.
And you can get fucked up.
And Gandalf knows how to use it.
Mm hmm.
Go, I'd say Hitler, who's a front frontline soldier, World War One Gandalf.
I don't know.
He got a lot of experience there.
A lot of experience.
He's full of Balrogs.
You know, I'm just saying.
Oh, this is suitable as well.
The next one says Sargons in the chat.
Get him in now.
I like the idea that we read this eight hours late.
I wonder if he's still there.
Clown man bad.
That's it's fair.
I sat through classes at Dartmouth, a place that educates world leaders in which students
and professors unironically suggested that Nazism is inherent to whites like genes.
That's when I knew I wanted to live in white neighborhoods.
Oh, raw.
Oh, raw.
Oh, raw.
I got a few of these free from YouTube boys.
So here you go.
Split amongst y'all.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Seriously, though, I'm excited to finally see you on a regular E-Fap
and I'm glad you're on with the original three.
So now I'll say hi, Anna.
And also hi, Rags.
Thank you. Hi.
Rags, you there?
His face is there.
He came back.
Yeah, he came back earlier, but he never he never he never said anything.
Maybe he like went to go fix his Internet in some place and it now is fixed.
And he's still not bad.
He's there.
I think the Internet.
Yeah, he's there.
Hey, there he is.
Hello, it went down for a wee bit.
Down a little bit down.
Yeah, you missed the Hitler Gandalf conversation.
Oh, no. Who won?
Well, you know what?
Everyone keep keep your opinions to yourselves.
All right.
That's really funny that you said that, Rags.
OK, so here's the question.
You can't see yourself.
Here's the question.
Everybody don't influence him.
All right. Let him decide this himself.
So Rags, here is your question.
OK, you got a tiny Gandalf with no magic who's four inches tall
and he has a knife versus the knife.
Wait, wait, how big is this?
A normal size knife that he's having trouble with?
Or we're told we're told it's a dagger.
I think in the spirit of the question, it is a tiny dagger that matches his tiny self.
OK, that makes sense.
Versus tiny Hitler at a whopping six inches.
That is two inches taller than Gandalf with no weapon.
But he's in his prime.
Who wins in this battle?
Hmm. I assume they're both in their prime, really.
Let me see. So.
That's going to be I think that Gandalf is going to win.
And my reasoning is this.
So a two inch advantage over a guy.
Hmm. It's pretty impressive.
However, that knife is matter rags.
I know, I know, I know.
But the knife is a big game changer, right?
Knives are quite the force multiplier.
And I think that Gandalf has way more skill and melee combat than Hitler does.
So even though Hitler's got an extra two inches on him,
I think that with a knife and a skill, Gandalf absolutely win.
Wasn't Hitler a World War One vet, though?
Didn't he? Yeah, I don't think he was like hidden trenches.
So Hitler hidden a trench while Gandalf was actually a battle.
Well, yeah. And this is melee combat.
If this was like a marksmanship contest, maybe.
But I also want to introduce the factor that how do we know that Hitler
and Gandalf wouldn't become lovers eventually?
Well, a can.
Well, the question was who should win
because Gandalf is not a blinded by their passion, that's why.
I'm pretty sure, like, given the situation,
they're not going to be given time to love each other.
One of them's dying and it's going to be Hitler.
What is time when love is involved?
And to be fair, the question didn't exclude the use of resurrection
or reincarnation.
So like Gandalf might have the extra edge there.
Just saying. Yeah.
What color is he turning to?
Essentially immortal.
Like if he is, then he would never lose.
Even if Hitler stabbed him to death.
Saruman did. Yeah, it's complicated.
We'd need law specialists for this one.
Yeah, Saruman.
Oh, yeah. And the extended version.
You know, sorry.
And I think you mean the V version.
All right. The version.
The only version worth mentioning.
I didn't own those versions.
I was accepted.
Here we go.
And then I didn't watch them until college.
And I was like, Holy shit.
Where are these things?
We'll see. We can't even judge it.
No, it's impossible because we know Jay.
So basically, Rags, we all agreed that Gandalf was going to win all of us.
Absolutely. Like what what all Hitler has going for him in this fight
is that he's substantially taller.
Like two inches.
This is like two.
I was going to say two inches.
Can we ignore?
They are six inches as a person.
Yeah, it's like a four foot tall person fighting a six foot tall person.
That's a pretty big deal.
Yeah, I mean, we ignore Hitler's powers of manipulation.
How do we know that you think Gandalf would fall for him?
Come on. No, I mean, who knows?
Yeah, Hitler manipulated an entire nation.
And in fairness, Gandalf had to stay away from the ring
because he was potentially incorruptible.
How do we know Hitler?
How do we know Hitler wouldn't adopt Gandalf to become like the Nazi secret weapon?
Like as he's trying to get closer and closer and stab at him,
you think Hitler's like, wait, is this the right thing to do?
Think about this. Right. Right.
Then again, does it more compelling English?
And does Gandalf understand German? I don't know.
I think I think Gandalf is multilingual, magically lingual, which no magic,
though, how's the universal trend?
Yeah, he doesn't have magic.
Oh, shit. Never mind.
No universal trade.
Actually, yeah. And that knocks out resurrection and immortality,
even if they were relevant. That's magic, right?
So it's true to talk about outside influences.
So like Galadriel could probably bring Gandalf back.
I'm pretty sure we're sticking to just these two.
I was going to say that we're talking the real Hitler.
I think the no magic part of the question is pretty much going to knock out
anything like that in the spirit of the question, as we would say.
Well, I mean, who still will live for a long time, as long as, you know,
well, I mean, we all pretty much agreed Gandalf wins,
but it's not like it's, you know, easy.
Like this could be an ongoing, you know, tiny person battle that.
Who knows? Maybe they chase each other weird.
This is kind of a weird hypothetical for me,
because normally it's fictional character versus fictional character.
But now we have fictional character versus real person.
Right. It's kind of weird.
Yes. Oh, shit.
I thought he was just the way to shut up arguments.
No one needs to.
Someone needs to stop him. Jesus.
Yeah, we should also stop Coney.
But he 20, 12, 20, 20, 12.
Oh, we can finish these two which has a two hours
queue, one point five hour arguing over who'd win between Tidy Hitler and Tidy.
We're a very serious podcast. Shut up.
Some things are very important to discuss.
OK, next. Did you get your Albion yet, doggo?
I have yet to decide on sword or propoon suspicious amount of women in this stream.
I have. Oh, yeah.
Someone had like deemed me about like their prostitute experience
and they typed out a long thing and I was going to read it,
but they kept bugging me to read it.
But it was a lot. I was like, well, chill, let me read it.
And then I like deleted it. So I.
Um, let me go to my emails here and see if because a few days ago,
I actually said I'm just a follow up to make sure I was still in the queue
and everything was all good and whatnot.
So let me check here with my emel emels.
Oh, they said everything is moving forward.
I don't have a firm ETA quite yet.
So I guess we're still looking at the around February
is probably about the time when it should be finished and done.
Oh, um, why not, man?
Why not both? Yeah.
Yourself a sword and some propoon.
Now, wasn't there a computer question for Wags earlier when he was gone?
Was there indeed?
I mean, look at my my selection so huge.
I really need to not be I got a whole bunch of a shad that we can get done
the next time he's here.
It's just the man, you know, no.
Oh, that's for Wolf Wolf Wolf.
Doo doo doo doo doo.
Oh, there was a high rags.
I want to send you the Darth Bane trilogy.
Is there any way?
Darth. Oh, it's good.
I'm actually on the last book of that.
Oh, the book.
I don't I don't know if I got time to read books.
I'm just going to be honest.
I have the audiobooks if you want them.
Um, I don't.
So I guess it depends on the summary of it.
No, I don't want no, because I don't know yet.
Hmm.
If you see this, you seem very apprehensive to jump into this.
Yeah, I am apprehensive to jump into a new trilogy of books.
Yeah.
Yeah, if you if you said the super chat, email me the channel, email
email me there and we can chat about it or DM me on Discord.
All right.
Rags mauler wolf, the unholy trinity.
Yeah, we're very holy.
Yeah, very, very.
I don't know all of the holes.
We're going to need a really big roof for this man.
That's the second joke of that kind.
It was very good stuff.
All right.
Gay movie.
Bob is Yodist Baggins.
Well, you know, if Yoda says it, I don't know.
Why did the tree go to the dentist?
It needed a root canal.
It need.
Why did the tree go to the dentist?
Yes.
I don't know why.
It needed a root canal.
What do you call a cow with no legs?
Can't move an immovable object.
Round, round beef.
Oh, no, round beef.
That's that's right.
That works. That works.
It's good.
What's the difference between roast beef and pea soup?
One's good and one's not.
Well, one's, I mean, besides the obvious, for the sake of the joke,
I'll say, I don't know.
Anyone can roast beef, but no one can pea soup.
I guess it's a matter of a while.
This ends with I'm done.
What if it's gamer girl pea?
Oh, no.
Well, it says I'm done.
I just wanted to tell some lame jokes.
You nailed it.
Petition to rename the chat maulers into continental liberation force,
which would be MILF.
MILF?
Press one, give milk or say hi rags to sign.
I've seen articles on how Joker only works with Arthur as white.
Yet there was another adaptation of a native son in 2019,
and many of those arguments suggest that bigger couldn't be a part of the
I don't know what native son is, I'm afraid.
Yeah, I don't.
There's nothing about Arthur's whiteness and the Joker.
Yeah, that would lead him to really do it.
He doesn't do anything because he's white.
I would say he could have been any color under the rainbow,
including people.
Anyone could be.
Yeah.
Anyone could eventually become a piece of shit.
Mm hmm.
Now, that's a good question.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anyone could eventually become a piece of shit.
Mm hmm.
The seeds of destruction.
They do.
Were sown when the trash compactor monster molested Luke and Leia watched.
The death nail was the Willy Wonka Oompa Loompas wore furry suits on Endor.
I'm shaking and crying.
I don't know what to make of that.
Scary.
The more content I watch from critics that defend TLJ,
the more it seems to me that they shape their critique to counter the people
who like or dislike it more often the films themselves.
Yeah, that's a big problem I've always had with a lot of the people we cover.
They often don't even fucking talk about the film.
Just talk about everyone else talking about it.
In the movie Bob thing we just watched, he barely actually talks about the movie.
Well, he had that one bit where he was like,
I could talk about all of the reasons why these things don't work,
but it's like, no, no, no, no, no, do that.
Where are you going?
I'm going to talk about Columbine, blah, blah, blah.
You guys only do as homonym this stream.
Well, yeah, but it's movie Bob.
Ah, fair point.
Yeah.
Basically.
Movie Bob.
What's as homonym?
Well, I mean, I think they did that on purpose.
I'm not sure.
Maybe it's ass homonym.
Yeah, you want to give them credit, don't you?
Well, if I was doing that, I would have read it out correctly.
I didn't.
I just read it out as it was said.
My ass homonym.
Movie Bob as the boulder rolling after Indiana.
So I guess that was posted before we actually showed the meme of that
actually being a thing.
This has been an adventure.
This is Rags.
We're in trouble.
It seems like all the Fabs are going to be eleven hours and fifty five,
but it's long.
We can't.
This can't go on forever.
I mean, it can, but we should.
We got to.
We got to.
I don't know if we need to pump the brakes on this or if we I don't know.
I don't know.
Do we need an intervention, Mahler?
What?
Me and you give each other an intervention down with us and be like,
guys, listen, what's going on?
What's going on here?
This has gone on too long.
Love this initiation.
It's about to be and that style was guilty, Bob.
They didn't.
Nobody likes it.
Have you seen a movie about video before, Ben?
Have you seen?
Have you seen the movie, Bob?
No.
How did you manage that?
You're like a you've been on the Internet.
Fucking you've seen it.
You've seen all of the things.
How did you miss movie, Bob?
Yeah, I'm not familiar.
Not a Channel Awesome movie reviewer.
No, no.
No.
The escapist.
The escapist magazine.
Yeah.
Well, we introduced two people to this man today.
And well, they they will be visiting the hospital probably.
They are.
So not a fan is what you're saying.
Oh, yeah.
Let's just say that every but every time we've covered movie, Bob,
the majority of the guests have left with like splitting headaches.
Like no joke.
You know, we're trying to find a way to sort that out.
Maybe, you know, me and Rags will get to the point where we just
transcript his video so that you don't.
There's a lot of visual and audio pain.
Well, yesterday on DP, we had a yesterday on DP,
we had Jesse Lee Peterson and we were just like, let's just.
Yes, we did.
Wow.
He was not.
You covered him.
He was on it.
He was on DP yesterday.
Wow.
Interesting.
Did you call your basic plan was just kind of like just act
like we think he's smart is basically.
And and the funny thing is like we had like Billy and I are the
the two main hosts of DP, but we have our fair share of regulars.
So I brought on like our two favorite regular co-hosts that are also
black guys.
So when he showed up, he didn't know what to do because normally he'll
be racist against black people if he's just there with just white people.
So like it was like 50 50 there.
And he's kind of like, oh, Jesse Lee Peterson.
I'm just going to go home.
You don't want to.
Yeah, he's he's pretty popular right now.
I see the people in the chat doing it.
But.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's be.
He was so nice, though.
He was he was really nice to us and really friendly.
Like he is a nice he does seem like a really nice guy.
He was.
Yeah.
He's he's strange.
I like him.
But he's he's a strange man.
Oh, he's a lot older than people think he is, too.
He's like 72 years old.
So he's.
Wow.
Yes.
Yeah.
You know, like I've always found and I don't find this to be racist.
Black people age better than.
Oh, they 100 percent do.
Yeah.
Well, I think surely that's not racist because that's like the
racist part would be like, why are you saying white people age badly?
No.
But what if I said black people were better at basketball than white
people?
People would say that that's racist.
They're saying.
I know.
I mean, people would say that's racist.
Well, that one's the interesting one to bring up when you have like
representation stuff and you're like, should they hire more white people
and like the NBA that is like, no, they could.
That's OK.
No.
But at the next summer Olympics, go look at all the
fastest runners in the world.
They all have a couple of things in common.
Yeah.
And and long legs, usually like like long legs in proportion to their
body size, usually that sort of thing.
But yes, I like they'll.
It'll be funny because I'll see like someone running for France.
They'll be like the 40, 50 meter dash runner for
France.
But they were born in Jamaica.
Like these European countries will like the recruit
athletes from other countries that can win.
Yeah.
We might be a citizen of France.
A lot of them are technically, but they have that problem in the
World Cup a lot.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
That's totally true.
All right.
I'm going to show you guys this picture.
Good.
Do it.
OK.
Yeah.
You know what?
I grew up in Ohio and and I'm I'm 38 years old.
And I remember when I was in my early 20s, I went and saw LeBron
James play while he was in the high school.
I saw him play in high school and he scored like 70 points by
himself in a high school basketball game.
It's well, he graduated from high school and played the NBA the next
year.
I know.
But I'm saying that's not a lot of competition when you're when you
know, incredibly talented at this one thing.
And then you're playing against other high schoolers that are just
playing it because they wanted to join a sports team.
That's why this photo reminds me of that.
To see someone who who's like the future greatest of all time
playing against a bunch of high school kids.
Everyone knew right.
Yeah.
Hey, y'all.
Here's some litter litter all free money.
Hi, Rah.
You did.
Hi, Rah.
Like not even right.
Scooby doo and the dancing Israelites.
Oh, my.
I mean, dancing is friendly.
So, yeah, not wrong with dance.
I'm going to have to disagree with all of you.
You're wrong to try and rationally deal with people like Bob.
Your entire frame is wrong for an engagement with him.
These are devil worshipping degenerates who take pride in
supporting baby murder and making reason and beauty rot.
They're ugly on a fundamental level.
Oh, my God.
Don't reason.
Oh, my God.
One of Jared's fanboys is tagging me in your chat.
I'm sorry for interrupting.
One of Jared's fanboys is tagging me in this chat right now.
Jared has.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He does, actually.
He does.
Wow.
Anyway, sorry for interrupting.
Keep reading.
Don't reason with them.
Bully them.
Harass them.
Beat them.
And that I mean, Rah, you know, that's I don't know about that.
You're never going to change minds that way, buddy.
Yeah.
The thing of it is change their mind if there's no mind to change.
Yeah.
Well, the thing of it is, it's all like at this point.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
He's chosen his path.
The thing of it is you've got to let him talk in order to destroy
himself.
It's that easy.
Yeah.
I mean, look at it.
If he wants to speak, if he wants to speak, we'll just let him go and
just kind of watch him dig his own hole.
What do you do?
What do you do?
It's like when he hasn't says like, you know, uh, thingy was good for
Westeros.
Like most like me rags and did rotting.
We're mostly just silent through like, uh, that was so painful.
Keep going, I guess.
Like keep the, is this really the way you're going?
You've dug yourself into the pits of the earth at this point.
Keep going.
I guess.
I love when rags, when you talk to people that are, you know, the
Game of Thrones supporters and it's like, you don't know anything really
too much about Game of Thrones.
I feel like that came out wrong, but, uh, as somebody that's not been a
diehard fan for as long as the rest of us have for you to like question
them on things because you genuinely don't know and watch them try to
explain it and rationalize it.
It's hilarious.
I think the best example was like, Oh yeah.
Walk of shame sexist that you were like, Oh, they never did it to a guy.
It's like, no, it's like the first get pissed.
They did it too as a guy.
Okay.
Rags and falls.
It's like, that doesn't sound sexist.
What do you want me to do?
Yeah, they do it to both.
It doesn't really sound like it's sexist.
But I was like, Oh, but when they do it to a woman, it's worse.
I'm like, okay.
But she chose to do that.
They're like, do this walk of shame or stay in prison.
She chose to do the walk of shame.
Well, the guy had no choice.
My big old cock flopping around a helicopter.
That bitch would be like, I'm out of prison.
Yeah.
And the guy had no choice by the way.
He was just forced into it immediately.
Anyway.
Hey, Wolf.
Glad to see you feeling better than that.
You're back on.
Good luck with the new channel.
Take care of yourself, mate.
I'm sure you would very much appreciate that.
He definitely would.
Imagine movie Bob floating in the air like Peter Pan.
He's wearing the anti-gravity suit that Baron Haran and war in the Dune movie.
Serious question.
More than any timetable for TFA critiques.
Will episode three be done by episode nine or are you waiting for episode
nine at this point?
So when I finished the redraft, right?
And then I started recording the first few pages and I said a couple of
things where I was like, man, those leaks we read.
Like if any of those are fucking true about Ray's parents and stuff,
I'm going to have to, this is all going to become pretty like.
You would listen to it and you'd be like, you saying this knowing about Ray's
parents is the kind of thing that needs a redraft.
If Palpatine is the grandfather or not.
And I'm just like, oh, like if I make the video, which by the way,
it's going to be pretty tough to make a three hour video fully edited.
And the way I do that TFA critique within a month,
especially when you've got a few extra episodes of batwoman coming out and
if upstream is like, I'm going to need probably two months to make that.
So it's not going to be able to come out before episode nine.
And then episode nine is going to very well change the script.
But when episode nine comes out, what's I'm going to want to cover that.
And then I want to do the critique of episode nine to cover in depth and
talk about everything that's wrong with it ahead of time.
So realistically speaking,
eat or do anything that you would do and just work on it.
TFA.
I'm totally oblivious to this.
Who is Palpatine supposedly the grandfather?
Oh, I'll go.
I'll give you that in a sec.
I'll just to finish up.
So TFA is a series.
It's probably going to convert itself into a look at the trilogy as a whole while
also judging TFA because I mean, it's not,
it's not like you guys desperately want to know if TFA is plotline makes sense.
Right.
Like, I think you already know, especially now.
Well, that's the thing.
I want to finish that series of videos.
I've written out that script and redrafted several times.
There's lots of stuff in there I really like and lots of research.
So it's going to happen.
It's just that I feel like I'm waiting for a biopsy diagnosis now.
Like I well, yeah, for what's going on.
Don't be lazy.
Make the video.
Don't don't don't be throwing the lazy word around.
Okay.
It's not cool.
Fucking work my ass off.
Just because I don't make you put out as many videos as fast.
It looks like I'm apparently lazy.
Like the you do it then.
I mean, that's that's I believe there was a guy a couple of months ago on my
discord who was like ripping into the fact that the TFA part three hadn't come out.
And then a bunch of people said he should go make it.
And he said, fine, I will.
I don't know if you ever did.
Oh, wow.
Yes, it's fine.
I will make a bajillion hour long video critiquing this thing.
Yeah.
So yeah, the idea is probably going to be that the TFA series will be
redrafted again once I'm finished with episode nine.
And it's going to evolve into a series that says something in completion about
the three films as a whole while the episode nine critique is going to be
very focused on episode nine specifically.
And yeah, I know that like it's like wow.
You spent a whole year doing nothing.
I'd be like, you know, I've been working on a shit ton of other projects.
It's not my fault that Game of Thrones crashed and burned like miserably.
Like if that didn't happen, there's a good chance TFA part three would exist right now.
I mean, it's pretty much guaranteed, but it happened.
And Game of Thrones was super important.
So like, like to me, I mean, I really like Game of Thrones.
It's really upset me what happened with a stupid last season.
So this is the thing, right?
Like it doesn't matter from my end because people just be like, you never
going to make it.
It's like, oh, I will.
It's going to happen.
It's going to take a while.
August 2020 might actually be the realistic result for TFA part three at this point.
I have a question as someone who wasn't a fan of Game of Thrones.
Didn't the books already tell you what was going to happen in the TV series?
Not at the end.
The books, you could say the books have gotten as far as like season five
and six ish with different points being further behind and further ahead.
And season eight of Game of Thrones was just blind to all of us pretty much.
You have assumptions, but OK.
So so it it started with the books, but then got ahead of the books themselves.
Yes. Wow. Amazing.
Mm hmm. That's amazing. Yeah.
That's amazing.
The thing is, 2020 might be the year that I release a whole bunch of shit
just because of the fact that this the script is ready to go for TFA part three
or well, the rest of the parts.
But then again, it'll need redrafting on the portions that are conclusive about the trilogy.
I don't care if I just made that word up.
It works well enough for my sentence.
So the parts that we know what you mean, it's a word.
It's they go.
But all the references to TFA itself, talking about the flaws of that,
they're all going to remain the same.
Like each of the tangents I take to talk about specifics in writing like that's all still there.
Yeah. And, you know, to answer.
So like some of the leaks have implied that Palpatine just straight up tells Ray that he's her grandfather.
And that's going to that's going to change a lot about how we view all of the films.
So so who did who did Palpatine impregnate to make that happen?
We're not apparently we're not going to find out.
It's two people. It's going to be one of two parents.
And those parents are gone.
Didn't they confirm it in a book comic book?
Did they?
In a way, I guess.
Well, I mean, in that way.
So this is the other problem is there's like a bazillion versions of episode nine right now.
So well, I saw somebody say because they confirmed in the comic book that Palpatine was the one that created Anakin through me.
So because of that, then somehow Anakin or as Darth Vader impregnated someone, which is Ray.
The easy way to say this is we need to see that fucking movie and then we can start really easily making definitive statements about things.
Right now we've got Ray's parents are in a box, if you will.
And they could be all different kinds of things in there all at the same time.
And so as soon as the movie comes out, that box opens.
That mystery box has its contents spilled out and we all get to see what it is.
Finally, I'm sure we're all looking forward to it.
But yeah, that's the it'll be great.
That's the thingy and thingy of it.
And like I said, the videos are coming.
It just makes no sense right now to try and focus and create a video that's going to be technically become relatively obsolete in terms of me talking about her heritage.
There's other stuff in there that works.
But I also it's not going to be possible for me to edit a three hour video fully in a month's time.
It's just not going to work.
The Game of Thrones episode three video took fucking ages.
Three or five?
Episode five.
Yeah, you said three.
Oh, I meant five.
Three.
Three was much quicker because I was fucking.
Yeah, I was about to say it's all like that.
That came out pretty quick.
But yeah, you know, stuff is on the way.
And besides, eFap fans have got plenty of stuff on the way, too.
Like there's seven pre-made videos that are just struggling with copyright right now.
There's a bonus eFap that's stuck behind copyright.
Like stuff is on the way.
That was the longest answer to any question ever.
I know people are going to get really upset about the fact that they're not going to get TFA part three before episode nine.
But the fact is, if I got three out, people would be like, where's four?
You know, it's like never ending.
I've got people upset at me for not doing this episode six for Game of Thrones as well and all the video game stuff.
And I'm just like, all I can do is explain my plans.
Sometimes the plans change.
It's the best I've got for you guys.
But I'm never not working.
There's like not a day where I don't do some form of work in relation to one of the two channels anyway.
Do you agree that do you agree that episode one through three in many ways is the story of the rise of Palpatine?
Yeah, of course.
OK, cool.
OK, cool.
You know what?
I sit next to Billy the fridge who doesn't agree with anything I feel about Star Wars at all.
Oh, we experience some of that.
Yes.
You see, this is the thing like he would have to try it.
I think because you guys did come on.
I think he has to try and avoid mentioning any of that in front of the fat fan base because he'd be like, I know.
He's great.
It'd be like, what do you what did he say?
What did that guest just say?
It's fine.
It's fine.
Six ago, when you guys were on, he was doing it again.
He thinks The Last Jedi is the greatest Star Wars movie ever.
But he's not sure what he does this thing where you can't he does this unfalsifiable thing where he says it.
It might be the greatest Star Wars movie ever, but it depends on the next movie.
And I'm like, what?
I mean, you know, everyone has an opinion, right?
It's fine.
It's all good.
No, no, no.
Open up.
Let's hear how you feel.
A lot of.
A lot of people.
That.
Oh.
That.
They should be judged on their individual merits.
I know.
No.
No.
I don't care if the next movie is the best movie ever.
It doesn't make that movie good.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, like so a lot of people said this about TFA because they were like, if if you could pay off the points in TFA, well, it would you would at least make the movie better in terms of its setups.
When I suppose we have to remove ourselves technically and be like, well.
Is that really fair?
It's like really complicated to sort of figure out exactly.
But I guess if we're going to say that a sequel can't necessarily make the one that came before it any better, then it also can't make it any worse.
Right.
No.
Yeah.
I don't think it can make it worse.
I don't care if it wins the Academy Award and everyone's like, whoa, this is genius.
I don't care.
One for worse.
Yeah.
Get some of them.
The worst.
Well, like if everyone agrees, the next film in this trilogy is just a masterpiece.
Like everyone blows it out of proportion.
It doesn't make the previous movie better.
It doesn't.
It could be a plus.
It could be the new Citizen Kane of the 21st century or whatever you want to say.
Yeah, I mean, I pretty much.
It's not sure it will.
The thing about the one aspect that we have to worry about is stuff like recontextualizing something.
So let's say, you know, a character like Luke Skywalker looks in the head of his fucking family member decides he needs to die.
You could have a set of flashbacks in episode nine that further inform that and make it more reasonable.
Or turns out he was a clone.
That's not the actual Luke.
He was captured.
He was kidnapped.
He was put in.
And you know, so we're like, oh, so you have all these judgments about TLJ about this character being assassinated.
Turns out that's not him.
So like it complicates judgments.
Is it weird that it wasn't Luke Skywalker dying in the last movie that disturbed me as much as the green boob milk that he drank?
No, I think that's.
Yeah, there's certainly some aspects to it.
You know, there's a reason I picked it for my like, that's what I put up whenever I say what the fuck at this point, because it's such a moment of just like, what the fuck?
I literally said that in the theater.
Like, what am I watching?
It's weird.
Sure.
I would rather them cut.
I'd rather them cut open Tontons for fun and lay inside of them.
Just like whatever.
It's past time.
Yeah.
Down right.
Comfy compared.
I don't know.
Moving on swiftly as usual.
Okay.
Anna, that three fifths Star Wars girl.
Love you, Anna.
I feel like I'm more two fifths with how short I am, but thank you.
That was a very old super chat.
Yeah.
We're all.
I like how I leave for like three and a half hours and come back and we're at the super chats from the beginning of this dream.
We're talking about Scooby Doo and the open door poo.
If cinema can make three thousand six hundred dollars a month.
Nothing can stop you.
Don't let your dreams be dreams.
Thanks lads and lasses of efap.
I had a nice podcast to listen to while I was working.
Oh, that was from weekend war.
Oh, good.
Good stuff.
But you were able to get through the day with a little help.
Finally caught a stream live rhino milk for all.
Yes.
Very generous.
Bob's the biggest one man case study for physio.
Physiognomy is young to me.
Physio.
Physio.
Nog me.
My my comprehension is clearly dead.
Physi physiognomy a person's facial features or expression.
Especially when regarded as indicative of character or ethnic origin.
Thanks.
Thanks.
You knew there is a photo of Penny with a two familiar message from Thomas Wayne.
So the relationship is ambiguous on purpose.
Might be true.
Might not.
Hi regs.
Hey.
Yeah.
I need to rewatch the film and fucking scroll through each scene in detail to see what information we really get about everything to do with whether or not there was an affair between her and Thomas Wayne.
Interesting though.
Sargon wouldn't even rape movie Bob.
True.
I wouldn't.
The relationship is a big question.
Love you TW on the picture of his mother and Wayne.
Yeah.
OK.
It's fair.
I'm sure there's there's there's details that can lend to Len.
Who knows how much of it was true.
Maybe they were in a relationship but maybe that's all that it was.
There was nothing else after that.
Who knows.
Maybe half of it was real.
Then maybe she you know let her mind get away from her and.
Yeah that sort of thing.
Only just now read.
We can worry.
Super chat.
We're going to be here for years.
Hey.
We're doing everything we can.
OK.
You guys going to get Magog of more scar on.
I have no idea who that is.
I know him.
He's a friend of mine.
Cool.
Is it.
You know we're never against pretty much anybody coming on Twitter at some point.
So good work out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Don't throw movie blob the ensuing earthquake.
Oh.
And is completely missing the point.
You people are acting surprised because you think he's stupid.
He's being willfully insincere.
All of these people are.
Willfully insincere.
I mean.
I don't know.
I believe movie Bob believes what he believes if you know what I mean.
Yeah.
Mm hmm.
Like.
I also.
It's like he's not stupid.
He's willfully insincere.
Like.
He's just.
Yeah.
It's just crazy.
Yeah.
It's sort of a.
Yeah.
Complicated case study to say the least.
Yeah.
Putting child abuse in your movie that's kind of cringe bro.
Man who lives in his brother's basement.
Do you mean mother.
Oh well maybe.
Um.
Oh man it could be.
Did you say that.
Yeah.
I mean.
Did you say that when child abuse is cringe or.
I don't remember.
I don't think of what that's referencing but it's probably still movie
Bob.
Well I.
I guess.
Well he was making.
Just kind of brushed it aside.
He did that sound effect when.
They talked about the child abuse.
Oh right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And it's like just as sad noise and it's like what.
Okay.
So that's not bad.
That's that's not a reason why he went in.
All right.
Yeah.
Oh.
Poor you.
Poor you.
It's like.
Child and change a bit.
Um.
Greetings from Paraguay.
Hello.
Thanks more and everyone else in the family helping me survive my
horrible job for more than three months.
I can't express with words how much y'all have helped me.
Oh.
Oh my goodness.
Good stuff.
Yeah.
I won't do it.
Oh man.
Um.
I'm here from that guy who was doing a 43 hours at work that one
time.
Oh yeah.
That's the same guy.
43 hours a day.
He's being willfully insincere about the facts.
I mean.
Yeah.
But like, you know, there's a good like, do you.
Okay.
So what would you guys take be that these people are deliberately
lying about the film or that they've got a really bad memory or that
they're stupid and they didn't even comprehend events.
Um, mostly the third, but I think it was part of the first.
Yeah.
I think it's a mixed bag and that there's different ones for different
people in my experience.
And I can totally see why someone would conclude one of the three more
than the other two, but I feel like we,
there's lots of room with movie Bob.
Like that man's crazy.
Also.
Yeah.
I feel like maybe he's got his head just really up his ass to the point
where he kind of misses a lot of things or he doesn't talk about anything
or to find anything.
Uh, high rags.
Hey.
And then it says Ola rags.
Hola.
Hola.
No, no.
And then it says.
Emba el Chapa rags.
I don't know.
I don't know that one either.
Only one set movie.
Bob has multiple chins.
Why not multiple moves?
I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't,
I'm not, I wasn't, I wasn't the artist.
Okay.
I didn't draw any of it.
Um, but guess what guys?
He loved frozen too.
Is frozen to even out?
I asked this every time.
I'm so excited for frozen too.
I'm not yet.
He may love frozen too.
I don't know what that would tell you about movie.
Bob.
Let it go guys.
Let it go.
Wow.
Two women on.
Is this efapocalypse?
I don't know.
We survived.
Baby Yoda fighting Palpatine.
Oh my God.
That's something we argued about today on DP was like, is it baby Yoda?
Is it baby Yoda?
No, it's not baby Yoda.
Yoda's dead.
How could it possibly be Yoda?
That's what we said, but people keep calling it baby Yoda.
Like, yeah, no, no, no.
Yeah.
People don't know what the species is called.
Yeah.
Like it's just a code name.
I'm going to say, is this so cute?
Oh, my.
Oh.
species.
There's the species name is is not recorded.
Apparently the species has no name.
Oh, which doesn't make sense.
And people would obviously have a name for it, I guess.
But they're the Yolo.
They originated in 2014.
The Yolo's.
It's got to be some kind of alien.
Yeah.
It'll be great.
Yeah, I guess it's supposed to be all.
We don't even know.
Yeah, sure.
All right.
Baby Yoda.
It is.
Movie blob cherry picking his evidence to make his points is nothing new.
He studied under the tutelage of Anita Sarkeesian.
In short, he's a fraud.
I mean, yeah, I can agree with that.
He's certainly a fraud.
Like.
Fucking.
It's nuts watching his videos.
I don't understand.
Fraud.
Oh, got him.
Anna, do you really want a conversation with Bob?
Um, the thing is, you got to like that other super chat said, saying, I wasn't getting
it.
When you talk to someone like face to face, there's a lot there that you can learn from
the person or learn about the person as compared to, you know, just not seeing their face and
just hearing them talk sarcastically on a video on YouTube.
So yes, I would like to talk to him in person just to gauge if he's actually this stupid
or if he's just putting on a show.
I would agree with that.
Yeah, it's fair enough.
I mean, I would talk to him.
I'm not eager to do it, but I would talk to him.
Teen Titans Go is better than Captain Marvel and The Last Jedi.
That's probably true.
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think I'll just by default, I'll say that things are better than Captain Marvel and
The Last Jedi.
Mm hmm.
Never seen Captain Marvel.
You haven't.
It's terrible.
To me.
To me, Captain Marvel is Shazam.
That is the real Captain Marvel.
That's the original Captain Marvel.
Didn't people like Shazam, though?
From what I know.
Yeah, I liked it.
I actually went and saw it.
I always liked that character, how it was basically Superman, but he was a little kid.
He had like the little kid mind, but he was like, basically Superman.
I always liked that character.
They had a really good episode of the Justice League Unlimited with him in it.
And they were all making fun of Superman to like, oh, he's more of a boy scout than you
are.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I I always hated how they couldn't call him Captain Marvel after a certain point because
D.C. acquired that.
That was like an intellectual property that existed prior to D.C.
But when D.C. acquired it, they couldn't use the name Captain Marvel anymore.
But he's the original.
Well then.
Do you read the OG Captain Marvel?
Yes.
Yes.
And it was a man.
Wow.
No response.
Well, there was also Mary Marvel, too.
I just want to think about his madness.
There's a whole bunch of marvels, isn't there?
Because isn't the best trend in Captain Marvel is going to turn out to be a Captain Marvel
or something?
I don't know how it works.
I just know that Captain Marvel was a mistake in the MCU.
I mean, if anyone anyone watching this stream right now, if you want to know the real story
behind Captain Marvel, Google Captain Marvel Steamboat, Captain Marvel used to have a side
kick named Steamboat.
Oh, and that's all you need to know.
Just look it up.
You know, what was Steamboat's powers?
I'm afraid to say anything else.
Like if you look up Captain Marvel Steamboat, I get like now it's like, why did DC even
buy that that property?
Steamboat's powers, cooking, cleaning, driving a car.
Oh, oh, my goodness.
Wow.
Are you looking at images of Steamboat or?
Oh, my goodness.
I can see why Steamboat wasn't in the new Captain Marvel movie.
Oh, no.
Full Steamboat.
Oh, my goodness.
My favorite character.
Watch fucking Steamboat.
Here, I'll show you a picture of Steamboat here.
This is Steamboat.
Oh, this is a better.
Let's see.
That's that's.
Yeah.
All right.
Here's a picture.
Yeah.
Oh, let me put this in the right tip to.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
Yes.
Let's see.
I like how it says the world's mightiest mistake.
Jesus Christ.
Oh, sweet Jesus.
Well.
Yeah.
Well.
Well, well, well, what can you say?
Captain Marvel.
Oh.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh.
Oh.
What?
Dude.
Yes.
Read the dialogue.
Read the dialogue.
I had you come banging in.
What's cooking in kryptum this time?
Oh, no.
They gave him you.
Hello.
Steamboat.
Nothing important.
I got a tip.
I love the tip.
Jesus.
Jesus.
Oh, my God.
Oh, shit.
Wow.
That's.
Can you imagine if Steamboat was that incarnation with Captain Marvel in Captain Marvel?
Jesus.
Oh, man.
That needs to be the next DC film.
Oh.
This is rough, man.
Yeah.
Glory to me.
It's today of judgment.
Oh, my goodness.
This is awful.
I'm crying.
The Golden Age.
Shake my head.
Captain Marvel, I'm so glad to see you.
This is terrible.
This is really bad.
Very bad.
Oh, my goodness.
Like, people do this stuff now as parody.
But back then, this is how they are.
What a time.
What a time.
Oh, my God.
After Joker kills his mom, is he now an orphan?
I think we said the rules are that once you're old enough to own your own blood, it no longer counts, right?
Once you kill your own parents, that doesn't count?
No, no.
So let's just say you became orphaned at an age in which you could own your own blood, you wouldn't be an orphan.
I think that was the ruling.
Something about that.
An orphan needs to be able to own his or her own blood.
I think that was part of the deep lore, the orphan lore.
That was the JXC, cynic snacks, deep lore.
Very complicated.
But yeah, you could theoretically kill your parents at a high enough age and you would not be orphaned, as long as you've got the certificate.
That gives you ownership over your own blood.
Just want to make sure everybody's clear on that.
Very important.
Themes over substance, high rags.
Hey!
Bubsy for Smash Bros.
Hey, hold out hope it could happen.
Petition to rename Movie Bob, Movie Boomer.
Give milk to sign.
This guy really wants people to sign.
I'm working nights at the moment, and Bob gave me the mother of all rage headaches that'll definitely keep me awake.
Thanks, Cinema Roberto.
Thank you.
And then censored.
Oh my goodness.
You should be back.
I disavow.
I'll have to catch the rest on Moolah.
Night everybody.
Good night.
Good night.
Did you just call Cinema Roberto a waterhead?
Nice.
That's a reference.
A reference Ben gets, right?
Right, Ben?
Oh, sorry.
I ran away to fill up a water bottle, but I see Steamboat as a hit in your chat.
He's kicking butt and taking names, man.
Yeah, he's sitting here, right?
Yeah, I'm stopping Steamboat.
That should be the next DC film.
They fucked up Green Lantern.
They can't possibly mess up Steamboat at this point.
I agree.
Ra get the roof, the heavy roof.
I think he knows he's on it.
Do not read Jenny's Twitter.
She is a complete bimbo.
Oof.
They allow bimbo on Superchance.
In fairness, this said she's a complete bimbo, but, you know.
Who's Jenny?
She's the one that we criticized.
And well, the world ended.
We should have known better.
Mola, please watch Seven Caias, Seven Boxes.
A funny movie from my country, Paraguay.
By the way, Terrejo E. Japiro, Tunere Mokoi, Jaguar Tembo.
Love you all.
I agree.
Buenos dias, Ben Shapiro.
Yes.
And yeah, I have no idea what that Seven Boxes thing is, but I guess I'll pop it on the list.
As one said.
Yes.
Right.
My first Superchat free fap.
Wanted to say that you guys make my workday go a lot easier.
Go by a lot easier.
Also, welcome back, Wolf.
And hello, Nags.
Hello.
And yeah, good stuff.
And if Wolf were here, you know, if we had rewound by six hours, he would have said hello.
He would have.
He would have.
Finally saw Joker yesterday.
I didn't know he came back.
That's pretty awesome.
He's making his way.
He's making some videos on YouTube as well.
A new channel of writing and rage.
Finally saw Joker yesterday.
I don't see how anyone can hate this movie.
It's uncomfortable at times.
Sure.
But it was the point, right?
It makes you think.
No, it said nothing.
That's what they don't like.
It makes you think.
No, we've been told it says nothing.
It's meaningless.
How could you?
How could you conclude that it has meaning?
Wrong.
Wrong.
Movie Bob is the overarching villain of Efap.
Is he?
Oh, I guess we covered him quite probably Patrick Willems.
If ever we cover him again, who's the it can't be down with thrust because he's like
gone and he's also a hero of the stream now.
But he would have worked.
It's hard to know these things.
Also, I've created a steamboat meme in your chat.
I mean, I'm sure they love him.
Steamboat.
Steamboat.
Steamboat.
Also, Anna, please convince me to watch The Clone Wars.
It's the best Star Wars content since the OT.
Yes, smaller.
Watch The Clone Wars.
What do you have against watching The Clone Wars?
I hate women.
Fuck you.
I'll get around to it.
I'm sure of it.
Just play it in the background.
It's really good.
The writing gets a lot better as the seasons progress and it's really good.
So just watch it.
How many seasons is it?
I believe there's seven.
Wow.
They're really good.
Is there a new one coming out or did it come out?
Yes.
So the new one is supposed to be coming out.
But the thing is, it's so there was going to be another season.
But then for whatever reason, they didn't make it, but all they had animation
done for it.
They had the writing done for all of it.
So it was there.
They just didn't make it for whatever reason.
And so, yeah, so that one's going to come out and I have high hopes for it
because everything was already done, which I think is why they're going to
make it.
Plus also the characters and the show was actually pretty popular.
So yeah, but I would highly recommend if you guys haven't seen it to watch it.
It's really good.
All right.
And whenever they use the excuse, oh, well, it's for kids.
Just throw down the Clone Wars.
Be like, that was for kids.
And look at how well written that was.
There's so many.
So I'm going to feel the same way.
Like I'm a big Trek fan and I always like Star Trek, the animated series.
Like a lot of Trek fans consider that actual canon and people like that more
than a lot of the live action series that they put out.
Really?
I don't think I've ever heard anyone say that they like the animated series
better than any of the live action series.
Really?
I've heard plenty of people say that.
I wasn't even aware there was.
We're just talking to different people.
The war of the anecdotal evidence.
I'm actually a bigger Trek fan than Star Wars.
And I've been to the big cons in Las Vegas and everything.
And I.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like I've heard people say they like the animated series, especially like,
well, a lot of the people who are in the into anthropomorphic animals
like that.
You know, the the Tiger Lady Lion Woman character.
So.
Yeah.
I'll check.
Freaking nerds watched man stuff like Star Wars.
Like Star Wars.
Star Wars.
Well, Star Trek is Star Trek.
Star Trek is more cerebral and takes more thought.
Yeah.
So I believe there was a the distinction between Star Trek and Star Wars was an interesting
one.
One is science fiction.
The other science fantasy and science fiction.
Star Trek was because it worked very well, actually.
I have something that you guys will appreciate.
Let me find it.
So I have a very long screenshot of this.
But years ago, somebody on Facebook decided to intentionally piss me off.
And they decided to post on their Facebook Star Wars versus Star Trek.
Ready, set, go.
And I tend to write very long things when I think that the argument is invalid.
Let me find this and share it in the chat so you guys can see just how excessive this
argument was for me.
But I'm one of those people that Star Trek and Star Wars are so different that you just
because they're sci fi does not mean they're comparable.
Right.
Hmm.
I agree.
You'll appreciate this.
You you will be appreciated.
I'm excited to share this with people that will understand the context of this.
All right.
Here you go.
Hopefully it up.
So how do you how do you think Picard will be?
What are your expectations?
I am very skeptical just based on what they've been doing, especially with discovery and
all the people that are running it.
And then after watching the series, just I mean, remember when Picard tried, he even
considered after what happened with him when the Borg and how he went back to the vineyard,
he saw his brother and everything.
And then he realized, you know, he had that job offered on the Atlantis project.
He's like, no, I need to be an outer space type of thing.
And then later on, when he gets that message saying that his nephew died and he's talking
to Deanna about how nobody is going to carry on the Picard line.
It's going to die with him and his brother.
And he's, you know, debating about life.
I was like, they need to watch those two episodes before they write this because based on the
trailer, it doesn't seem like they even took into consideration his reflection.
But there you go.
What you're referencing, what you're referencing is part of the next generation and then part
of a film.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So and like the cannon between the films and it's a little show, a little off.
Yeah.
But mostly consistent.
But there you go.
There's my down of the debate between Star Wars and Star Trek.
Oh, my goodness.
I don't know if my full name is going to put it on screen or that's why I said I don't
know if my full name is in there.
I just realized that.
Well, I can I can just not.
It's it's big chat.
It's very big.
That's the point.
She wrote an essay and blur it out.
She wrote an essay.
You did a long man bad, didn't you?
I did a long woman bad.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very, very true.
Long woman bad.
Long woman bad.
Working security for the same play for the third time and I am in fact bored.
Don bless.
Damn.
If you're bored on the third time, we've been told that this means it's bad.
That's that applies to every piece of content ever.
OG Teen Titans was my favorite show.
Raven sit on my face.
Oh, my goodness.
What I hate most about Jenny is that she uses the dum dum.
How we autism look to shield herself.
Fans of that shit should be thrown into lava.
Oh, my goodness.
Not even off a roof.
I don't know.
Well, off the roof into lava.
Oh, OK.
They're not exactly.
Is that house in a safe area if surrounded by lava?
I don't know.
Maybe the lava is just in like a specific like a well and the rest of the area is
actually quite pleasant.
I don't know.
I'm not going to assume things about Ras backyard.
You know, I'm not the kind of not the type to do that.
Hi, mailer.
Hello.
A lot of people end up saying mailer because more gets corrected to it.
It's quite funny.
So mailer.
Yeah.
Hi, Wolf.
I rag.
Hey, got classes in six hours.
Can't catch this one live, unfortunately.
Probably awake right now.
So anyway, I have five bucks for hearing about fluffy rags.
Also 10.
Thank you.
Fluffy rags.
Hang in there, Anna.
Bob has killed too many of us.
So for reference, we covered a video, another video, memes, and then started super chats.
And according to these super chats, we haven't even gotten past the first video yet.
Oh, no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good to hear you again, Wolf.
I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
That's a pretty nice kind of problem to have, though.
I mean, yeah, we just got him.
My issue is I really want to get to everybody.
And so I don't like, you know, we're not going to be able to finish these in time chat.
I know this is a huge shock to you.
Like we're about to hit the cut off.
We've got we've got literally 12 minutes.
No, 20, 32 minutes, 32 minutes.
We're going to have to come up with some thing.
Well, I don't think this is going to be a consistent issue.
This is because we had a bleed over before and then we had a bleed over again.
And during our super chat read, we had several people here.
That's also something that slows us down a bit, but not in the way that I'm saying like, oh, you guys should leave.
I'm just saying that that explains it.
We could you know, the Aiden solution was to just have a super chat stream.
We could do that after this one, but I don't know how much energy is remaining in our cast today.
Yeah, it's it's almost four in the morning.
That doesn't you always say that like it means that we never know where you or when you're sleeping.
Oh, I I'm tired.
That's it. Nailed it.
All you have to do is just say you've been up for X hours.
I don't even know how long I've been up.
So the plan is probably going to be that we will pick these up on.
I can't believe it.
Like pick them up as in we'll go from where we left off on Sunday night, which is going to be any fab.
We've already got topics and guests set.
So, yeah.
Yeah, I know that the idea is that they could stop bleeding over every stream.
We're going to I think with the Sunday one, me and Rags will make it so that it's me and Rags.
Right. And we'll we'll we'll nail it.
OK. Yeah, I think we could pound them out.
You know, yeah, we're efficient.
The two of us are very efficient.
So for the first five hours, no problem.
Just smaller and Rags.
Sure. Yeah. OK.
Anyway, I'll carry on and we'll do as many as we can before we hit this cap.
All right.
What I hate most about Bob is that he's fat and ugly.
What? That's. Oh, man.
Geez.
Good goodness.
That's rough for you.
He's just throwing them all out tonight.
Fire in all cylinders.
In 2019, the Wayne Killer would have logged it.
Yeah, I mean, probably.
Imagine the amount of coverage all of that would have gotten in 2019.
The riot portion of Joker.
God, I feel like a cut out rags is perfect for rubber ducking.
I need this in real life right now.
Rubber ducking.
I guess how is he referring to the little the little paper cut?
Yeah, maybe like having a little rags float in a bathtub or something.
Is that what that means? I don't know.
Papercraft drag.
It's like a debugging thing.
Oh, it is.
Yeah, it's it's a method of debugging code.
Rubber duck debugging and software engineering rubber duck debugging is a
method of debugging code.
The name is a reference to story in the book.
The pragmatic programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber
duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it line by line
to the duck.
All right. Yeah.
Use rags as a little duck.
That's fine.
And that's another rubber ducking also.
So there's a few other ones rubber ducking is used to describe the act of
sexual intercourse between two females while using a strap on for penetration.
Yeah. Okay.
But it is a term for ball tapping.
It is also used to describe the act of slapping a woman's breast to inflict
pain.
When one does either of these actions, they must scream out rubber duck or
rubber ducked.
The first person to ever ball tap someone under the new name was N.K.
from Pennsylvania at about four thirty p.m.
The first time a breast was slapped under the name was about ten minutes later
by a K.P. from the same state.
What the fuck?
That's oddly specific.
So I don't I don't know what they're talking about when it comes to rubber ducking.
Yeah. Well, I mean, there could be multiple things.
I'm going to go with the debugging one.
That seems like the most likely.
Even if it were debugging, why a rubber duck of all things?
I don't know.
It's from a story.
Rubber duck.
Well, you could be like, why is Luke in a farm?
You know, moisture farm.
You could ask all kinds of questions, dude.
Like, come on.
More like rub rear dick on some.
I don't know.
Oh, man.
Oh, even you.
You're unimpressing dust bullshit now, right?
You are deflating him.
It's not important.
Inflating deflating me like a rubber duck.
Like a rubber boobabob.
Like a rubber bob.
All because someone said rubber ducking and then we had to find out what it meant.
Yeah, I know. It's not awful.
It's the super chat.
You have to blame.
It's what you have for thirty seven hours now.
Yes.
We have to discover and research rubber ducking.
Does movie blob have any surviving brain cells?
Does he just vomit up with salad thinking it makes him sound intelligent?
I'm not going to say that's not the case.
I'm sure he thinks it sounds very intelligent.
He thinks he's very smart.
He's a very smart man.
Mm hmm.
Yeah, he barely uses any periods when he's doing his sentences.
That makes him smart.
My mom has experienced multiple friends end their lives due to mental health issues in the eighties.
This movie gives a visual to the people who have no idea how bad it can get.
Makes me appreciate it even more.
I mean, yeah.
Suicide really big in the eighties.
I don't know about that, but just just general mental issues.
It's just like there's never going to be a time where that's not a thing.
Or cocaine, cocaine.
Yeah.
Carrie Fisher did cocaine in the eighties and now she's dead.
That's true.
There you go.
Correlation.
Why is Keith Richards still alive?
Yeah, it was always.
It made him stronger.
Always outliers.
Always outliers.
Uh, Joe, I think maybe Carrie built up a resistance to it.
Yeah.
Joker was on the jab pills.
Doesn't it make sense?
Not going to say it doesn't.
Yeah.
My mother was bipolar and she constantly was changing meds and had an entire box full of her medicine.
So yes, she took away more than seven pills and still lived.
Oh, yeah.
So Ben, one of movie Bob's points was that if you're taking seven forms of medication at the same time in the eighties,
then you should be comatose.
I don't, you know, I don't.
Uh, it's obvious.
Like till this day, till this day, you should still be comatose.
No, just it doesn't even necessarily matter what the pills you're taking are.
If you're taking seven, that should put you in a coma.
That's all.
Grass friends, a Viagra, some, I don't know, sleeping pills.
We even included the possibility of placebos.
Fucking water pills.
You're just like sugar pills.
But what about like some herbal remedies to seven herbal remedies?
Would that put you in a coma?
I don't think so.
Yes.
Um, I made a know your meme page for Efap.
I have no idea how no your meme works, but I mean, it'd be pretty complex.
What is Efap as a meme?
That'd be pretty difficult to explain, wouldn't it?
Oh, goodness.
We are an umbrella of memes.
We are a meme factory, as they say.
We're a category category.
I just read most of that essay.
We, uh, we, we got the edited version of the essay too.
If you want to put it up, I see she, uh,
Oh, do you want me to scribble out my last name?
I mean, she re uploaded it.
It's wow.
Like this is like my, uh,
My thesis of my junior year of college right here.
You know, what's funny is when I had to take the essay teas,
the first time I took them,
the essay portion was asking are people born bad or people created bad?
And so I wrote it completely about Star Wars and, you know,
the arc of Anakin versus the arc of Luke and like bringing in all the Star
Wars lore. And I've, I was actually pretty proud of it and I'm surprised,
but I got a perfect score in the essay section of the essay teas for that one.
And I was like, this is the greatest moment of my life.
Like I don't do well on tests,
but I am glad that whoever was grading that was probably a Star Wars fan.
But then the second time I took the essay teas,
I got on where you had to write an essay based on some quote.
So I tried to relate it to Star Wars and Star Trek.
That one I didn't get as well of a score,
but I also was very hungover, but still.
Yeah, kind of was all the same along the lines of this one.
But yeah.
Well, reason.
Don't go to school, stay home and watch movies.
Yes.
They teach you everything.
Like as Jenny pointed out,
Joker teaches you that medication is bad.
Just all of it.
Don't take medication people.
And see, nobody's actually like, you know,
countering this was clearly true.
Like I wouldn't be able to say something like this without it being true.
If someone had criticized it.
So it's, you know,
just saying everybody here agrees with it automatically.
I mean, I'm,
I'm not a doctor, but sounds good to me.
A girl in college told me she quit smoking and her oxy addiction for me.
Bitch was my stalker.
I bet if they made a film about her issues, this fat.
Oh my goodness.
Fat fuckle.
I think he was going for a K would love it.
But because Arthur's a white guy, oh,
screw his movie.
I want Bob ed.
And I have an aneurysm trying to get past filters.
Oh yeah.
That probably explains all that.
It's lots of different words.
He wants to get through.
This tame versions of all of the words you're using,
right? You'll be fine.
Just use, just use those good old tame ones.
Get right in there.
No problem.
Um, an Efap on my birthday with wolf.
What a marvelous gift.
Oh, it's a couple of people's birthday things.
E-man and, uh, that's three now.
Yep.
Wow.
What a marvelous gift.
Also high rags.
Hello.
Anyway, keep up a good work of brightening my commutes to uni.
Cheers.
All right.
Good stuff.
Efap is definitely good for commutes.
Weren't you even saying that about your old commute?
Yep.
I mean, I used to listen to Drunken Peasants when I was going to uni.
Oh yeah.
I was, I was there for a lot of the, uh, the, the big events,
especially the, the, I was there thing with the sitting.
Oh man.
Oh yes.
Yeah.
That, that was impromptu, uh, as well.
Uh, Brett showing up for that stream was not planned.
Whatsoever.
So yeah, there's, there's quite a bit of history there.
It was epic.
Uh, cue for all flat earth or two.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Brett just vanished from YouTube again.
Again.
Recently for like, yes.
For the seventh time.
Seventh?
You sure is that few?
You're right.
It could be like 20th for all.
I know.
Um, cue for all favorite Indiana Jones film.
Also high rags.
Uh, last crusade is my favorite last crusade.
Yeah, I gotta agree.
They're all good though.
That's the thing.
You're all good.
I enjoy them all.
Well, not the fourth one.
Oh, right.
That doesn't count though.
Yeah.
Um, black block exists since the seventies.
It's not anonymous.
Anonymous.
Sorry.
Um, that's probably in reference to Bob talking about how it's referencing
something that's out of here and stuff.
That whole video is real headache.
Honestly, thinking about it again, like the whole, they're pulling things from
timelines and they're not allowed to use them in other timelines.
That's bad.
It's like, Oh, it muscle is the theme of this video that we shouldn't take our
insulin.
Bill Bob Bagman, 1940.
It could be weird.
How movie blogs speak so fast.
Spews so many words at his audience yet says little of substance.
Big fan of you lads and lassies, by the way.
Oh, I hope you're enjoying the show.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
This one just says Wolf.
Check your Twitter.
I'm assuming it was about memes.
It probably was.
Should I bring Billy the fridge in here right now to plead his case about
Star Wars?
No.
No.
Well, we should, we should stick this over.
We've, we've got, we've got less than 20 minutes to get as many of these.
Oh, sorry.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
I don't know if you've ever done it bad, but we're about to hit the, uh, the
YouTube cap.
I think you have, right?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, damn it.
YouTube for not telling me if that was live.
Anyway, rags.
Well, if you guys are enjoying the Mandalorian, definitely check out the
clone wars and rebels.
There's some tism, but they're good.
Rebels is not as good as clone wars.
Uh, that's all I ever hear.
I haven't actually heard the reverse ever.
It's always that the clothes is better.
There's certain episodes that are really, really good, but it's really hard
to invest in certain characters like Hera and Zeb are awesome.
It gets better with time, but the two main characters, Ezra, Ezra, and
Canaan.
Oh.
Um, if apps IMDB page has a higher rating than batwoman.
So if app is officially better than batwoman.
All right, guys, we did it.
That's good achievement.
We did it.
We're better than batwoman.
Yeah.
Thank you.
It's a feature.
Hi, mola.
Hi, wolf.
Hi rags.
Hello.
Hey.
Also, hi rags and hi Anna.
Welcome to your first official efab as guest and hi, Jay Longbone.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi.
I'm watching about two hours behind, but I wanted Thorn to be my Tig Biddy goth GF.
I mean, so it's a fair choice from what we understand.
A lot of people are going with Thorn.
Tig Biddy.
Love my ass off.
Bernie gets was Jewish, not white chipman.
That's from Rah.
I remember that was the article.
I think he brought up right from nineteen eighties, I think.
Has Bob never heard of the opium war?
Well, this is the thing.
It didn't even matter if he was like, Oh, it happened in this timeline.
So it can't be here.
It's like, why?
Why can't there be a drug issue like at any point?
Why does it have to be at a specific timeline a day anyway?
But there's also referential things that actually match.
So the whole thing just hits like it's like, why don't you point here, Bob?
Does Bob never heard of a treadmill?
I'm sure he's heard of them.
He's aware of their legend.
Yeah, he got tired just thinking about him.
Um, SNL was in the seventies as well.
It was.
I don't know.
I don't know when SNL started.
That's I'm not sure.
Let me check.
When did SNL start?
October 11th, nineteen seventy five.
No kidding.
Wow.
Yeah, I thought that started like in the mid eighties.
No, no.
Mid eighties.
By the time they hit the mid eighties, they had like Eddie Murphy and all them.
The original cast was Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, you know, that that era, John Belushi.
So, yeah, it was like it was, you know, late mid to late seventies.
Nothing funny.
Just want to support.
Thanks, guys and gals.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Insane Scarface impression on my page.
OK.
The same scarf.
All right.
Good stuff, man.
I talk with Skitzos daily.
Seven pills is a good day.
Yeah.
Well, he said it's OK today.
It's not OK back then because it's different.
Mola, invite me to the stream.
I have opinions, too.
OK.
I mean, you know, as you can see with chat, we've got everybody has opinions.
Yeah.
Opinions are like look at Ryan Connelly.
He just said Bill Murray.
That's an opinion.
You can't deny that.
He was not an original S&O cast member, but he came around very early.
While I hate the idea of a Joker sequel, I'd love to see a series of Batman rogues films
in the style of different directors.
Ivy as by John Carpenter, Riddler as by David Fincher, et cetera.
Your thoughts?
Sure.
Yeah.
The problem we start to get to when you highlight like, oh, imagine this with this and this
and it's like just good stuff.
Give me some good stuff.
A little bit deprived of it for the high budget areas of movie making.
Billy just told me that he's very disappointed in you all that you didn't like The Last Jedi.
This is not the audience for him to say that.
Everyone's just kidding me.
I know.
I know.
I just want to watch him implode.
That already happened, right?
We debated about it for a little bit.
I know, but he'll do it again.
He'll do it till the end of time.
He will defend it forever.
Has he seen my series of videos?
Can I just ask him to watch them and then see what he thinks?
I can ask him.
The problem is I don't know if he has a free five hours.
That's the problem.
I did.
I watched them, though, because I watch a lot of stuff while I'm setting up stuff for
stream.
So I watched a lot of your stuff.
Did I?
Did I make you leave even more?
No, no, I'm not easily influenced.
If I like something enough, it'll take a bit to sway me.
I just didn't like that.
I didn't like I haven't liked the first two movies of the newer trilogy.
The first one seemed way too familiar to me.
And then the last one just didn't make sense.
And but, yeah, one thing that did make me like it less was, you know, when you take
that big fight scene in the throne room and slow it down how it doesn't add up.
You think that's something that they would.
Yeah, you you think that's something that they would examine frame by frame and
make sure at least that makes sense.
Yeah.
But I think there's a mindset of as long as it can trick people.
And I'm not saying that in a disingenuous way in a filmmaking sense.
As long as it's fast enough that no one can really tell it's stupid.
But that's not really.
That's lazy.
Yeah.
Like that's the problem.
There's a lot of filmmaking elements that get corners cut as long as you can just
make it look like it sort of looks OK.
And I'm just I don't know why they would they have access to just the best
photographers and all these people and all this time and money.
And it's like, come on, guys, make something incredible.
Do it.
Yeah.
Oh, here comes another one.
Hi.
I do Stowell's Impressions on my channel.
If you want to check out Stowell's Impressions, it's a channel called Gin Kid.
A strange man in trying to get it's J.
I.
N.
N.
K.
I.
D.
All one word.
Hope Joker sequel is starting.
Yes.
Gin Kid.
Hope Joker sequel is good, but I prefer no sequel.
Yeah.
I mean, a lot of people feel that way.
It's just so unlikely a sequel would be as good as the first, I guess.
And that is a really hard act to follow.
And then we're all going to be very worried about the ruin element.
Please don't ruin.
Lord of the Rings would have been better if it was set in modern times.
Instead of building sets and costumes and all that dumb stuff.
Agreed.
Is this mother Hubbard really complaining that they put too much effort in.
Bob, you absolute spoon.
Oh, Mother Hubbard.
20th Century Fox released the trailer for the Call of the Wild.
And it looks like garbage.
It was a Jack London classic and how harsh the Alaskan wilderness is.
But now it's been turned into a boy and his dog story.
I've heard that Harrison Ford is in that trailer and apparently there's a really badly CGI dog.
That's all I've heard.
Anyone else know anything about this?
I.
I think that if you if you're going to have a dog in something, it better be done well, quite frankly.
I agree with that.
Call of the Wild.
Apparently it's awful.
Call of the Wild.
I've seen it.
Call of the Wild.
Yeah, I've seen that film before.
I guess this is like a new one coming out.
Because the trailer is just released for it.
Apparently it's horrible.
Yeah.
Really?
From 20th Century Fox, which.
I thought they were done now because any media from them is Disney now, right?
Or I guess they stay.
I don't know.
I probably don't know.
Oh, wow.
We've literally got under eight minutes or around eight minutes.
OK, it's the prequel to White Fang.
All right.
Yeah, I remember that.
Hi there, rags.
I'm doing fine.
Water may not be wet, but does light shine?
Yeah.
All right. Nailed it.
In Movie Blob's review of Joker, he says the along the lines of this movie has
nothing to say and won't shut up.
Oh, the irony.
Agree.
Well, I don't know.
I don't know if not light shines.
I mean, you would say that light is.
Light has the property of doing the shining, but then the shining is just the
light, you know, the photons and all that stuff.
So I don't know.
I had to think about it.
That's fair.
I'm not sure.
Maybe ponder further.
You know, maybe you'll ponder further.
I will ponder further.
This video by Cinémaroberto sounds like a fast-talking Jeb Nichols.
Like, what the fuck did he watch?
Also, hi, rags.
Hey.
Movie Blob's sex doll is Jeb Nichols' giant porg.
Oh, no.
Jeb is in there.
You can't do that.
Oh, no.
Oh, Jeb.
I mean, I lived in a basement apartment when I was a kid.
Well, like I said, I'm sure it's a real thing.
It's just the fact that he referred like it's.
I did like I'm assuming it's just his parents house in which he was living in
their basement and he called it a basement apartment.
Seems unnecessary when you just say it's a basement.
Trying to make it sound a little different from what it probably is.
I don't know.
Sounded funny to me.
That's all.
Chris Stuckman gives knives out an A minus.
He called Ryan Johnson a master filmmaker who can write full write masterful
scripts with great plots and characters.
Oh, of course.
OK, Chris.
All right.
Chris.
Chris.
Now that's a full circle reference.
Chris.
Movie Blob is self-partnered.
Get it right, guys.
Just like Emma Watson.
Oh, I heard about that.
People aren't single anymore.
They're self-partnered.
Emma Watson.
It's all guys.
She's a woman.
She's a feminist woman.
This is my last of my free S.C.
Take it from me.
Very well.
Thank you.
Send film Robert back to the abyss from whence he came.
I mean, pretty much.
I don't we don't really have any intention to cover him anymore now unless he has a
super tism take.
But I mean, that's pretty much what I would have said before Joker came out.
So, yeah, you know, he could be back at any moment.
Dollar because rags likes aqua teen.
Yeah, man.
It's a weird show, but it's good stuff.
Oh, aqua teen hunger for us.
I don't know.
Yes, no.
OK.
Yeah.
This is fun.
It's hilarious.
I like the show.
Professor excessive weight.
I get it.
Rags.
My apartment is above ground.
Movie Bob me and intellectual basement apartment.
Yeah.
It's just strange to me.
I saw my podcast grows with an awesome length.
It's Jeb tells me to defeat you.
Now take this.
My wolf, my rags and all of my n words.
Objective mauler sword.
OK.
Love your steamboats, huh?
Oh, I'm sure there'll be a super chat that mentions steamboat once I get to the
end of this list.
Love you, dog daddy.
Thanks for getting me into PC and mauler.
I watch both your videos while at work.
Twelve hour shifts.
There you go.
I'm starting to notice that there's a lot of fans in the fab who work long
shifts and have long commutes.
It's no coincidence.
I think the long man content has found a long audience.
Yeah.
Well, see, I have been thoroughly informed that nobody watches this.
Oh, nobody.
All right, guys.
No one would.
No one would.
No one.
Nobody.
Yeah.
It's just too long.
Nobody does that.
It is long and I think I am going to go to bed.
I appreciate you guys having me on.
No problem.
Mr. Ben.
Thanks so much.
People go to bed early.
Thank you so much.
You guys have a great night.
You too.
Good night.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Bet.
Queen and Slim causes race riots with Joker cause no violence.
Queen and Slim.
What's that?
Anyway.
And Slim.
Queen and Slim.
Queen and Slim.
Yeah.
I mean, I'm not sure that is.
Yeah.
Also, this one just says mauler.
Sorry.
Sad face.
No.
No.
It's okay.
No.
There are days when my fondest wish is that eugenics hadn't been tainted by racists and
Nazis.
You call them weekdays.
Diabeto.
He did say that.
Yeah.
Diabeto.
Don't forget the mad lib super chat from last efap.
Oh, see, we actually saw that out right at the beginning, didn't we?
That's bullshit.
Sorted it right out.
Nailed it.
What's funny is like the last word we used objectively, it actually like fit in perfectly
at the end.
Objectively speaking.
Oh yeah.
Maybe he switched them around to make sure it worked perfectly, but I am okay with either
of those results.
Okay.
Occupy Wall Street was subverted by corporations that deployed the progressive stack to kill
the protest.
This fat ass knows nothing about race and protests.
I mean, that wouldn't surprise me, to be honest with you.
You know nothing.
He says a lot of stuff where you're just like, Bob, what are you, what are you getting that
from?
Bob?
Explain, Bob.
Has any of you read movie Bob's book?
It's a diary of a madman.
No.
His book?
I didn't know that that existed.
Let me, uh, movie Bob book, um, he's got, let me check.
Super Mario bros three, brick by brick, more than a strategy guide, bigger than a retrospective.
Wait, he wrote this?
Yeah.
Oh my goodness.
A whole new look at one of the greatest video games of all time.
Film critic and game journalist, Bob Chipman, attempts the most in-depth analysis ever
of his all time favorite game.
It is, it's only 2.2 out of five stars after 110 ratings.
So, um, why are you guys doing Efap 61?
Efap 62 is coming out.
Well, this is Efap 61, right?
There is no Efap 62 yet, lies, lies and slander, even though there will be any second with
the BBC letting it exist, you know, we'll get there.
You guys have girls on?
Ew.
Hashtag woman bad.
Oh, I guess you could say woman bad.
It's okay.
Everybody's bad.
That's how it works.
Women's.
Even chat man bad.
Don't forget that Diabito wrote a book.
Oh wow.
What a coincidence.
Super Mario bros three, brick by brick, where he revealed he literally wants to be Mario
and pretends he is Mario often.
Oh my god.
Is this true?
He reveals he wants to be Mario.
Well, you know, whatever works.
Keep in mind, by Movie Bob's logic, he cannot possibly like Ghostbusters 2016, since it
was primarily a carbon copy of the acroid one.
I mean, I'm sure you would spin something.
I don't think I ever saw a video from him on Ghostbusters 2016, but I'm sure he made
one.
Um, wouldn't surprise me.
Also, I'm gonna have to say we probably stop there.
We've only got a minute left, and I want to make sure it doesn't bleed over too much
where it gets cut.
Thank you all so much for watching, and for the memes, and the very kind donations, and
the guests for coming on for as long as all of you did.
All relevant links are in the description, and I'm sorry we didn't get to all the superchats.
We will carry them on on the Sunday eFap, which will be 11pm GMT.
Gonna be doing one of them Australian ones.
And yeah, I think we will probably do like no memes on that stream and go straight into
superchats and try and get this all caught up.
So yeah, just a couple of days, folks, and we'll see you there.
Anything else you guys want to say before we close out?
That's gonna do it for me.
Yeah, I think I'm all set.
Sorry I had to take off for a while.
I am super tired right now, though.
Yeah, same for me.
But since we're running out of seconds, we literally go seconds.
Bye.
Bye.
Love you guys.
Bye, everybody.
It's been a lot of fun.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
He punches bad men.
